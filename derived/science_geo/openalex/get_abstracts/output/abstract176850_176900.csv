https://openalex.org/W2095188021,"Nanoparticles of CdTe were found to spontaneously reorganize into crystalline nanowires upon controlled removal of the protective shell of organic stabilizer. The intermediate step in the nanowire formation was found to be pearl-necklace aggregates. Strong dipole-dipole interaction is believed to be the driving force of nanoparticle self-organization. The linear aggregates subsequently recrystallized into nanowires whose diameter was determined by the diameter of the nanoparticles. The produced nanowires have high aspect ratio, uniformity, and optical activity. These findings demonstrate the collective behavior of nanoparticles as well as a convenient, simple technique for production of one-dimensional semiconductor colloids suitable for subsequent processing into quantum-confined superstructures, materials, and devices."

PARP-1 is also a mediator of cell death after ischemia-reperfusion injury, glutamate excitotoxicity, and various inflammatory processes. We show that PARP-1 activation is required for translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the nucleus and that AIF is necessary for PARP-1-dependent cell death. N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, H2O2, and N-methyl-d-aspartate induce AIF translocation and cell death, which is prevented by PARP inhibitors or genetic knockout of PARP-1, but is caspase independent. Microinjection of an antibody to AIF protects against PARP-1-dependent cytotoxicity. These data support a model in which PARP-1 activation signals AIF release from mitochondria, resulting in a caspase-independent pathway of programmed cell death."

A computational method, RESCUE-ESE, was developed that predicts which sequences have ESE activity by statistical analysis of exon-intron and splice site composition. When large data sets of human gene sequences were used, this method identified 10 predicted ESE motifs. Representatives of all 10 motifs were found to display enhancer activity in vivo, whereas point mutants of these sequences exhibited sharply reduced activity. The motifs identified enable prediction of the splicing phenotypes of exonic mutations in human genes."

The synthetic poliovirus cDNA was transcribed by RNA polymerase into viral RNA, which translated and replicated in a cell-free extract, resulting in the de novo synthesis of infectious poliovirus. Experiments in tissue culture using neutralizing antibodies and CD155 receptor–specific antibodies and neurovirulence tests in CD155 transgenic mice confirmed that the synthetic virus had biochemical and pathogenic characteristics of poliovirus. Our results show that it is possible to synthesize an infectious agent by in vitro chemical-biochemical means solely by following instructions from a written sequence."

To examine the mechanism underlying leptin's metabolic actions, we used transcription profiling to identify leptin-regulated genes in ob/ob liver. Leptin was found to specifically repress RNA levels and enzymatic activity of hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), which catalyzes the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. Mice lacking SCD-1 were lean and hypermetabolic. ob/ob mice with mutations in SCD-1 were significantly less obese than ob/ob controls and had markedly increased energy expenditure. ob/ob mice with mutations in SCD-1 had histologically normal livers with significantly reduced triglyceride storage and VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) production. These findings suggest that down-regulation of SCD-1 is an important component of leptin's metabolic actions."
https://openalex.org/W1991263619,"The late Pleistocene history of seawater temperature and salinity variability in the western tropical Pacific warm pool is reconstructed from oxygen isotope (delta18O) and magnesium/calcium composition of planktonic foraminifera. Differentiating the calcite delta18O record into components of temperature and local water delta18O reveals a dominant salinity signal that varied in accord with Dansgaard/Oeschger cycles over Greenland. Salinities were higher at times of high-latitude cooling and were lower during interstadials. The pattern and magnitude of the salinity variations imply shifts in the tropical Pacific ocean/atmosphere system analogous to modern El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). El Niño conditions correlate with stadials at high latitudes, whereas La Niña conditions correlate with interstadials. Millennial-scale shifts in atmospheric convection away from the western tropical Pacific may explain many paleo-observations, including lower atmospheric CO2, N2O, and CH4 during stadials and patterns of extratropical ocean variability that have tropical source functions that are negatively correlated with El Niño."
https://openalex.org/W2012982424,"Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the cold tongue of the eastern equatorial Pacific exert powerful controls on global atmospheric circulation patterns. We examined climate variability in this region from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present, using a SST record reconstructed from magnesium/calcium ratios in foraminifera from sea-floor sediments near the Galápagos Islands. Cold-tongue SST varied coherently with precession-induced changes in seasonality during the past 30,000 years. Observed LGM cooling of just 1.2 degrees C implies a relaxation of tropical temperature gradients, weakened Hadley and Walker circulation, southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and a persistent El Niño-like pattern in the tropical Pacific. This is contrasted with mid-Holocene cooling suggestive of a La Niña-like pattern with enhanced SST gradients and strengthened trade winds. Our results support a potent role for altered tropical Pacific SST gradients in global climate variations."

Plants containing flavonoids are used to treat diabetes in Indian medicine and the green tea flavonoid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), is reported to have glucose-lowering effects in animals. We show here that the regulation of hepatic glucose production is decreased by EGCG. Furthermore, like insulin, EGCG increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and it reduces phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner. EGCG also mimics insulin by increasing phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p70s6kactivity. EGCG differs from insulin, however, in that it affects several insulin-activated kinases with slower kinetics. Furthermore, EGCG regulates genes that encode gluconeogenic enzymes and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation by modulating the redox state of the cell. These results demonstrate that changes in the redox state may have beneficial effects for the treatment of diabetes and suggest a potential role for EGCG, or derivatives, as an antidiabetic agent.

These results demonstrate that changes in the redox state may have beneficial effects for the treatment of diabetes and suggest a potential role for EGCG, or derivatives, as an antidiabetic agent. For centuries, folk medicine has employed plants and herbs for their medicinal and protective abilities. Recent epidemiologic research shows a positive correlation between the consumption of fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes and the prevention of chronic illnesses. Phytochemicals, naturally occurring plant biochemicals that give plants their color and flavor, may improve or prevent a number of chronic diseases because of their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic activity (1Craig W.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 70: 491S-499SCrossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The polyphenols, which include more than 4000 identified flavonoids, comprise one of the largest groups of active phytochemicals (2Hollman P.C. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 1997; 51: S66-S69PubMed Google Scholar). Green tea, a beverage commonly consumed in Asian countries, is a significant source of a type of flavonoids called catechins. The green tea catechins include (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 1The abbreviations used are: EGCG, (−)-epigallocatechin gallate; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; DCFH, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGF-1R, IGF-1 receptor; Dex, dexamethasone; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; SOD, superoxide dismutase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; IR-β, β-subunit of the insulin receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. (−)-epigallocatechin, (−)-epicatechin gallate, and (−)-epicatechin (Fig. 1) (3Guo Q. Zhao B. Shen S. Hou J., Hu, J. Xin W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1427: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). EGCG is the most abundant of these catechins, and many healthful benefits, including anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, antiangiogenic, and antiviral activities, have been attributed to EGCG (4Katiyar S.K. Mukhtar H. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1997; 27: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 5Yang C.S. Wang Z.Y. J. Natl.

Okubo S. Hara Y. Antivir. Res. 1993; 21: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). EGCG may also possess antidiabetic activity. In a recent report, injection of EGCG into lean and obese Zucker rats significantly lowered blood glucose and insulin levels, and green tea extract increased glucose metabolism in adipocytes (8Kao Y.H. Hiipakka R.A. Liao S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 980-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 9Broadhurst C.L. Polansky M.M. Anderson R.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 849-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Additionally, (−)-epicatechin, which is structurally similar to EGCG, is the active compound in the extract ofPterocarpus marsupium Roxb bark, which is traditionally used in Indian folk medicine to treat diabetes (10Ahmad F. Khalid P. Khan M.M. Rastogi A.K. Kidwai J.R. Acta Diabetol. Lat. 1989; 26: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of diabetes is the inability of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose production. It has been suggested that increased gluconeogenesis is a main source of increased hepatic glucose production and that the ability of insulin to regulate transcription of the rate-controlling gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), may contribute to this problem. This point is underscored by the observation that in several animal models of type II diabetes and obesity, PEPCK mRNA levels are increased 2–3-fold over that observed in non-diabetic animals, despite the higher circulating insulin levels observed in the diabetic animals (11Hofmann C.A. Edwards III, C.W. Hillman R.M. Colca J.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 735-740PubMed Google Scholar, 12Noguchi T. Matsuda T. Tomari Y. Yamada K. Imai E. Wang Z. Ikeda H. Tanaka T.

Also, transgenic mice that over-express PEPCK display a diabetes-like syndrome (14Valera A. Pujol A. Pelegrin M. Bosch F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9151-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The rate of transcription of the hepatic PEPCK gene is increased by several hormones, including glucocorticoids, retinoic acid, and glucagon (via its second messenger, cAMP) (15Granner D. Pilkis S.

The use of specific kinase inhibitors revealed that PI3K, but neither MAPK nor p70s6k, is involved in the insulin response of the PEPCK gene (22Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A variety of other agents is insulinomimetic in the sense that these compounds reduce PEPCK mRNA levels. Such compounds include phorbol esters, compounds that elicit oxidative and cellular stress (such as H2O2 and sodium arsenite), and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1. These agents differ from insulin, however, in that they repress PEPCK gene transcription in a PI3K-independent manner (20Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L. Petersen D.D. Beale E.G.

Vanadate, a potent protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, also mimics several of the metabolic actions of insulin. For instance, vanadate lowers blood glucose in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, inhibits lipolysis in adipocytes, and increases glucose transport into L6 myotubes (27Valera A. Rodriguez-Gil J.E. Bosch F. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Brichard S.M. Desbuquois B. Girard J. Mol. Cell.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Unlike insulin, however, the above-listed effects of vanadate are independent of PI3K activity whereas the effects of insulin are PI3K-dependent (30Li J. Elberg G. Sekar N. bin He Z. Shechter Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2274-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Tsiani E. Bogdanovic E. Sorisky A. Nagy L. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Vanadate may actin vivo by enhancing insulin sensitivity and prolonging insulin action, effects that seem to be related to protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibition (32Fantus I.G. Tsiani E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, vanadate directly inhibits the activity of two key gluconeogenic enzymes, PEPCK and G6Pase, which also contributes to decreased blood glucose levels in diabetic animals (33Mosseri R. Waner T. Shefi M. Shafrir E. Meyerovitch J. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 321-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Westergaard N. Brand C.L. Lewinsky R.H. Andersen H.S Carr R.D. Burchell A. Lundgren K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The above-listed observations reveal that, although many diverse signals regulate glucose metabolism, an understanding of these signaling pathways should aid in the development of pharmacological agents to treat diabetes. A suitable antidiabetic agent should have actions similar to insulin, or it should bypass the defects in insulin action characterized by insulin resistance. Since EGCG reduces blood glucose by an unknown mechanism, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of green tea compounds on insulin signaling pathways, gene expression, and glucose production. Our experiments reveal that EGCG has some insulinomimetic activities in hepatoma cells and that it differs from many other identified repressors of PEPCK gene expression in that it acts in a PI3K-dependent manner. In contrast to insulin, however, the metabolic effects of EGCG are somewhat delayed and seem to depend on redox-dependent changes in the cell. H4IIE rat hepatoma cells were treated with a combination of 500 nm dexamethasone and 0.1 mm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP in the presence or absence of insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) or EGCG (Sigma-Aldrich), for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated for an additional 3 h in glucose production buffer (glucose-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm sodium lactate and 2 mm sodium pyruvate without phenol red) with dexamethasone and 0.1 mm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP in the presence or absence of insulin or EGCG. At the end of this incubation, 0.5 ml of medium was taken to measure the glucose concentration in the culture medium using a glucose assay kit (Sigma 510-A) (35Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Scott D.K. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and lysed, and the total protein concentration was measured (Bio-Rad) to correct for cell count. Total RNA for both primer extension reactions and ribonuclease protection assays was isolated with Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) using the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The PC28 and ACT25 oligonucleotides, which are complimentary to the mRNAs of the rat PEPCK and β-actin genes at positions 102–129 and 42–67, were used in primer extension assays as described previously (22Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Ribonuclease protection assays were performed according to the instructions provided with the Ambion (Austin, TX) RPAII kit, as described previously (35Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Scott D.K. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The rat glucose-6-phosphatase RNA probe was generated from polymerase chain reactions in which the downstream primer contained the T7 promoter. A 5-μl aliquot of the polymerase chain reaction was added directly to the components of the Ambion Maxiscript kit, with [α-32P]UTP to produce radiolabeled RNA. H4IIE or HepG2 hepatoma cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2.5% (v/v) newborn calf serum and 2.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. H4IIE cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and then incubated in serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of 10 nm insulin or various concentrations of EGCG. After different time points, cell extracts were prepared with a detergent lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mmNaP2O7, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 nm microcystin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were adjusted to 1 ml in lysis buffer before addition of the specific antisera used to immunoprecipitate the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (IR-β), IRS-1, or IGF-1R. The immunoprecipitations were carried out in reactions containing 2.5 mg of cell lysate and 2.5 μg of antiserum for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads (25 μl) were then added for an additional 1.5-h incubation followed by two washes of the immunoprecipitates in lysis buffer. The washed immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 45 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and proteins (30 μg per lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with specific antibodies for 2 h, followed by incubation with an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the ECL immunodetection system obtained from AmershamBiosciences, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, cell lysates were prepared as described above and directly dissolved in SDS sample buffer for analysis of proteins (PKB, p70s6k, and MAPK) by immunoblot analysis. One milligram of protein from H4IIE cells was immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for p70s6k (Santa Cruz sc-230), and the immune complexes were precipitated with 20 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in detergent lysis buffer and two times in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm paranitrophenylphosphate, and 10 nmmicrocystin (kinase buffer). Five micrograms of S6 substrate peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) dissolved in kinase buffer were added to the washed beads in a volume of 10 μl. Kinase assays were initiated with the addition of 10 μl of 333 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped with the addition of 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. Forty microliters of the reaction mixture was transferred to P81 phosphocellulose paper and washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid for 5 min per wash, followed by one wash with acetone for 5 min at room temperature. Five milliliters of scintillation fluid was added, and samples were read by scintillation counting. PKB was immunoprecipitated from 1.0 mg of H4IIE cellular protein extracts with 2 μg of anti-Akt1/PKBα pleckstrin homology domain, agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 90 min. The enzyme/antibody-agarose complex was washed three times with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, and 1 μm microcystin), twice with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% (w/v) Brij-35, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), and twice with assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Ten microliters of assay dilution buffer was added to the enzyme/antibody-agarose complex, followed by the addition of 10 μl of cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide (10 μm stock), and 10 μl of Akt/PKB substrate peptide (Upstate Biotechnology). Reactions were started by the addition of 10 μl of 333 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid and washed and quantitated as described above for p70s6k assays. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from 1.5 mg of H4IIE cellular protein extracts with 3 μg of a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz sc-559), and the immune complexes were precipitated with 20 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with wash buffer 1 (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 mm Na3VO4), two times with wash buffer 2 (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mmLiCl) and two times with kinase assay buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). The beads were dissolved in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer, followed by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 and 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Sigma-Aldrich). The phosphatidylinositol was sonicated in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EGTA before adding to the beads. The reactions were started by the addition of 5 μl of an ATP stock solution (0.88 mm ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 3000 Ci/mmol and 20 mm MgCl2) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 6 N HCl and 160 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) and spotted onto a silicon TLC plate treated with 1% potassium oxalate. The TLC plate was developed by chromatography in chloroform:methanol:H2O:ammonium hydroxide (120:94:11:16). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH) (Sigma-Aldrich), which is oxidized to the fluorescent product 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by ROS (36Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with various hormonal treatments or EGCG for 4 h and subsequently washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline. Serum-free media containing 10 μm DCFH was added, and cells were examined using a C5810 series charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu) attached to a DMIBR-E inverted microscope (Leica). Data were normalized to that obtained from cells incubated in serum-free DMEM. The production of glucose in response to insulin or EGCG was examined in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells incubated in medium containing pyruvate and lactate as substrates for gluconeogenesis. H4IIE cells were chosen for these experiments because they produce glucose in response to hormones in both a physiological and consistent manner. The cells were treated with a combination of 500 nm dexamethasone and 0.1 mm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (Dex/cAMP) in the presence or absence of insulin or EGCG, for 5 h to maximize glucose production capacity. Cells were incubated for an additional 3 h with Dex/cAMP, with or without insulin or EGCG, in glucose production buffer (described under “Experimental Procedures”). At the end of this incubation, 0.5 ml of medium was taken to measure the glucose concentration in the culture medium using a glucose assay kit (Sigma 510-A). Insulin, at physiologic concentrations of 10 nm, and 25 μm EGCG were comparable in repressing glucose production to basal levels (Fig. 2). Higher concentrations of EGCG had no further glucose-lowering effect (data not shown). Similar inhibition of glucose production was observed in hepatocytes after EGCG treatment but not after insulin treatment (data not shown). Others have shown that insulin does not inhibit glucose release from gluconeogenic substrates in either periportal or perivenous hepatocytes (37Ikezawa Y. Yamatani K. Ohnuma H. Igarashi M. Daimon M. Manaka H. Sasaki H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2001; 138: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Although the reason for this phenomenon is unclear, it is possible that components of the insulin signaling pathway necessary for repression of gluconeogenesis are disabled during the hepatocyte isolation procedure. Interestingly, these data imply that EGCG may act by a different mechanism than insulin, as discussed later. The decreased glucose production observed after EGCG treatment could be related to reduced expression of genes that encode gluconeogenic enzymes. PEPCK gene expression is increased by Dex/cAMP and is dominantly repressed by insulin in H4IIE cells (16Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1131-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 19Granner D.

Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15242-15251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were therefore treated with Dex/cAMP in the presence or absence of various concentrations of EGCG for 4 h, and RNA was isolated for primer extension analysis to measure PEPCK and β-actin (as a control) mRNA levels. EGCG, in a concentration-dependent manner, reduced PEPCK mRNA, as shown in Fig.3 (panel A). Insulin reduces PEPCK gene expression by a PI3K-dependent mechanism, and the effect of insulin is blocked by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002. MAPK is not involved, however, since MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitors do not affect the regulation of PEPCK gene expression by insulin (22Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were treated with EGCG in the presence of LY 294002 or U0126, a MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, to determine whether PI3K or MAPK is involved in EGCG-mediated PEPCK gene repression. As observed with insulin, only LY 294002 reversed the effect of EGCG on PEPCK gene expression (Fig. 3, panel B), suggesting the involvement of PI3K, but not MAPK, in EGCG-mediated repression of the PEPCK gene. The G6Pase gene is hormonally regulated in a manner similar to that of the PEPCK gene, and insulin also represses this gene by a PI3K-dependent mechanism (38Dickens M. Svitek C.A. Culbert A.A. O'Brien R.M. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The effect of EGCG on G6Pase gene expression was also examined using ribonuclease protection assays, with expression of the β-actin gene serving as a control (Fig. 3,panel C). Insulin and EGCG both repress expression of the G6Pase gene in a PI3K-dependent manner. These results suggest that EGCG mimics insulin action by repressing glucose production and the expression of genes that control hepatic gluconeogenesis. Insulin activates PI3K, PKB, and p70s6k in H4IIE cells (22Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The effect of EGCG on these kinases was therefore measured using in vitro kinase assays (Table I). H4IIE cells were incubated with 10 nm insulin or 50 μm EGCG for 10, 120, or 240 min, and each of these kinases was isolated and its activity was determined. Insulin and EGCG activated PI3K within 10 min. The activation by insulin was much more robust and remained high, even at 240 min. However, in the presence of EGCG, PI3K activity continued to increase at 240 min. Insulin caused a 2–3-fold increase in PKB activity, whereas EGCG caused only a small, but insignificant, increase in PKB activity. Insulin also caused a 2-fold increase in p70s6k activity, whereas the activation by EGCG was lower and only significant after 240 min. The smaller effect of EGCG on the activation of these kinases is equivalent to that observed after treatment of H4IIE cells with 0.01 nminsulin, which causes an ∼50% reduction in PEPCK mRNA levels (data not shown). These data, combined with the data that shows that LY 294002 reverses EGCG-mediated repression of PEPCK and G6Pase gene expression, suggest that a small increase of PI3K activity may be sufficient to repress these genes.Table IEffect of insulin and EGCG on kinase activityTreatmentPI3K activityPKB activityp70s6k activitySerum-free media1.0 ± 0.01.0 ± 0.01.0 ± 0.010 minInsulin96 ± 3.92.2 ± 0.72.2 ± 0.4EGCG4.3 ± 0.3ap < 0.05, Student's ttest.1.2 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.2120 minInsulin67 ± 0.43.1 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.2EGCG7.4 ± 1.2ap < 0.05, Student's ttest.1.4 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.5240 minInsulin73 ± 143.6 ± 0.82.1 ± 0.1EGCG13 ± 1.7ap < 0.05, Student's ttest.1.3 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.1ap < 0.05, Student's ttest.H4IIE cells were treated for 10–240 min with 10 nm insulin or 50 μm EGCG.

The -fold stimulation relative to control is illustrated for each assay. The results represent three to four assays ± S.E. The observed effects of EGCG on enzymes in the insulin kinase cascade may be caused by the inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity or by increased protein-tyrosine kinase activity. To determine whether EGCG increases the level of tyrosine phosphorylation, H4IIE cells were treated for various times with 50 μm EGCG. Cell lysates were then prepared, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis using a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. As shown in Fig.4 (panel A), insulin and EGCG both increase a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in H4IIE cells. EGCG increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of some of the same proteins as insulin, and it affected some additional proteins. EGCG also seemed to affect the level of tyrosine phosphorylation over a different time scale, because some proteins were affected within 30 min, whereas others were modified between 2 and 4 h. Insulin increases tyrosine phosphorylation on IR-β, IRS-1, and IRS-2. IR-β and IRS-1 were therefore immunoprecipitated and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation using phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies to determine whether EGCG affects the phosphorylation of these proteins in H4IIE cells. These cells do not express sufficient amounts of IRS-2 for analysis. Insulin and EGCG both increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR-β and IRS-1 (Fig. 4, panel B). Insulin increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins within 30 min, as expected. EGCG also increased the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation within 30 min, but further increases were noted up to 3 h. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins elicited by EGCG was not as robust as that observed with insulin. However, EGCG does p"

VRN1 encodes a protein that binds DNA in vitro in a non-sequence-specific manner and functions in stable repression of the major target of the vernalization pathway, the floral repressor FLC. Overexpression of VRN1 reveals a vernalization-independent function for VRN1, mediated predominantly through the floral pathway integrator FT, and demonstrates that VRN1 requires vernalization-specific factors to target FLC."

We characterized the expression of several genes within the network underlying the wing primordia of reproductive (winged) and sterile (wingless) ant castes. We show that the expression of several genes within the network is conserved in the winged castes of four ant species, whereas points of interruption within the network in the wingless castes are evolutionarily labile. The simultaneous evolutionary lability and conservation of the network underlying wing development in ants may have played an important role in the morphological diversification of this group and may be a general feature of polyphenic development and evolution in plants and animals."
https://openalex.org/W2106487474,"Photoelectrons excited by extreme ultraviolet or x-ray photons in the presence of a strong laser field generally suffer a spread of their energies due to the absorption and emission of laser photons. We demonstrate that if the emitted electron wave packet is temporally confined to a small fraction of the oscillation period of the interacting light wave, its energy spectrum can be up- or downshifted by many times the laser photon energy without substantial broadening. The light wave can accelerate or decelerate the electron's drift velocity, i.e., steer the electron wave packet like a classical particle. This capability strictly relies on a sub-femtosecond duration of the ionizing x-ray pulse and on its timing to the phase of the light wave with a similar accuracy, offering a simple and potentially single-shot diagnostic tool for attosecond pump-probe spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2125612235,"In cooperatively breeding birds, where helpers of both sexes assist with the provisioning and upbringing of offspring who are not their own, males tend to contribute more than females to rearing young. This sex difference has been attributed to paternity uncertainty, but could also occur because males contribute more where they are likely to remain and breed in their group of origin. In contrast to most birds, female meerkats (Suricata suricatta) are more likely to breed in their natal group than males. We show that female meerkat helpers contribute more to rearing young than males and that female helpers feed female pups more frequently than males. Our results suggest that sex differences in cooperative behavior are generated by sex differences in philopatry and occur because females derive greater direct benefits than males from raising recruits to their natal group. These findings support the view that direct, mutualistic benefits are important in the evolution of specialized cooperative behavior."

The oscillation period depends on the applied bias voltage, reflecting the energy band structure of Cu. The results are encouraging for the development of spin-dependent resonant tunneling devices."

https://openalex.org/W2052410726,"The use of different brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene promoters results in the differential production of 5′-alternative transcripts, suggesting versatile functions of BDNF in neurons. Among four BDNF promoters I, II, III, and IV (BDNF-PI, -PII, -PIII, and -PIV), BDNF-PI was markedly activated, as well as BDNF-PIII, by Ca2+ signals evoked via neuronal activity. However, little is known about the mechanisms for the transcriptional activation of BDNF-PI. Using rat cortical neurons in culture, we assigned the promoter sequences responsible for the Ca2+signal-mediated activation of BDNF-PI and found that the Ca2+-responsive elements were located in two separate (distal and proximal) regions and that the DNA sequences in the proximal region containing cAMP-responsive element (CRE), which is overlapped by the upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-binding element, were largely responsible for the activation of BDNF-PI. CRE-binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors and USF1/USF2 bind to this overlapping site, depending upon their preferred sequences which also control the magnitude of the activation.

Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). BDNF is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, and its mRNA expression is up-regulated by neuronal activity accompanying the influx of Ca2+ into neurons (2Ernfors P. Wetmore C. Olson L. Persson H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 511-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh A. Carnahan J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1994; 263: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The BDNF gene consists of four short 5′-exons (exons I, II, III, and IV) and a common 3′-exon V encoding a prepro-BDNF protein (4Timmusk T. Palm K. Metsis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1994; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Four promoters, BDNF-PI, II, III, and IV, were mapped upstream of the 5′-exons, respectively, which are differentially regulated by kainic acid-induced seizure in distinct regions of the rat brain (5Metsis M. Timmusk T. Arenas E. Persson H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8802-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), suggesting versatile BDNF functions in the brain (6Ayoubi T.A. Van De Ven W.J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of BDNF gene transcription will provide a better understanding of BDNF functions in the brain. We previously reported that BDNF-PI and -PIII were differentially activated by Ca2+ signals evoked via two distinct Ca2+ entry sites, the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (L-VDCC) and theN-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDA-R) (7Tabuchi A. Nakaoka R. Amano K. Yukimine M. Andoh T. Kuraishi Y. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17269-17275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). BDNF-PI mainly responds to Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC, whereas BDNF-PIII reacts to those evoked via either NMDA-R or L-VDCC but less to those via NMDA-R, suggesting that the transcriptional mechanisms initiated in response to Ca2+signals evoked via Ca2+ channels, at least in part, differ between BDNF-PI and -PIII. It has already been reported that the binding of cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) to CRE on BDNF-PIII is required for the Ca2+ responsiveness of BDNF-PIII (8Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 9Shieh P.B., Hu, S.-C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Quite recently, however, novel Ca2+-responsive elements (CaREs) of BDNF-PIII have been characterized and three CaREs, called CaRE1, CaRE2, and CaRE3 (or CRE), identified within a stretch of 170 bp upstream of exon III (10West A.E. Chen W.G. Dalva M.B. Dolmetsch R.E. Kornhauser J.M. Shaywitz A.J. Takasu M.A. Tao X. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 2002; 33: 383-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition to CREB, which specifically binds to CaRE3 (or CRE), a novel calcium-responsive transcription factor, which specifically binds to CaRE1, has been found to drive the neuronal specific activation of BDNF-PIII in response to the Ca2+ signals (11Tao X. West A.E. Chen W.G. Corfas G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 2002; 33: 383-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown whether the CREB or another transcription factor is involved in the activation of BDNF-PI. In the present study, we assigned the Ca2+-responsive DNA elements of BDNF-PI and identified the transcription factors binding to these responsive elements. As a result, we found that not only the CREB family transcription factors but also the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) bound to the responsive site on which the CRE and the USF-binding element overlap each other. It is well established that CREB is a transcription factor, which conveys intracellular Ca2+signals to the gene through its phosphorylation at Ser-133 (12Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 13Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). On the other hand, USF transcription factors encoded by two distinct genes (USF1 and USF2) are basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper family members, which preferentially interact with the E-box (5′-CANNTG-3′) or with the consensus USF-binding element (5′-GGTCACGTGACC-3′) (14Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 15Bendall A.J. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). USF-binding sites have been found in a number of cellular genes, which are recognized by the USF homodimer, the USF1/USF2 heterodimer, or some other heterodimer in combination with other transcription factors (16Sirito M. Walker S. Lin Q. Kozlowski M.T. Klein W.H. Sawadogo M. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar,17Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Aperlo C. Fujimoto M. Ariga H. Nomoto A. Kato H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear whether USFs are involved in the activation of gene transcription in response to the Ca2+signals evoked via Ca2+ influx into cells. Here we demonstrated a unique contribution of USFs to the Ca2+signal-mediated activation of BDNF-PI, which bind to the DNA sequences overlapped by CRE. Antibodies used for the supershift assay were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). These were as follows: rabbit polyclonal antibody against ATF2 (N-96), C/EBPβ (C-19), C/EBPδ (C-22), the CREB/CREM family (X-12) (which partially cross-reacts with other ATF/CREB and CREM families), c-Fos (D-1), Fra1 (N-17), USF1 (C-20), and USF2 (N-18) and mouse monoclonal antibody against ATF1 (C41–5.1) (which specifically reacts with ATF1, but not with other ATF/CREB transcription factors). Additionally, mouse monoclonal antibody against the CREB family (25C10G) (not specific for ATF1) reacts with ATF1, CREB and CREM; furthermore, mouse monoclonal antibody against CREB (24H4B) specifically reacts with CREB, but not with other ATF/CREB transcription factors. Normal IgG was also used as a control. Primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were prepared from the cerebral cortexes of 17–18-day-old rat (Sprague-Dawley) embryos as described previously (18Tabuchi A. Sano K. Nakaoka R. Nakatani C. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, small pieces of cerebral cortex were dissected by enzymatic (DNase I (Sigma) followed by trypsin (Sigma)) treatment and mechanical dissociation, and the cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells in a 60-mm culture dish (Iwaki). The cells were grown for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) containing 10% fetal calf serum, and then the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glucose (4.5 mg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), sodium selenite (5 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), and kanamycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) (TIS medium). Cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) was also added at 2 μm to prevent the proliferation of glial cells. The medium was replaced with fresh TIS medium, but devoid of cytosine arabinoside, 2 h before DNA transfection. Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using ISOGEN (NipponGene). RT-PCR was performed as described previously (19Tabuchi A. Koizumi M. Nakatsubo J. Yaguchi T. Tsuda M. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 39: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA in 20 μl of 1× first strand buffer containing 0.5 μm oligo(dT)15 (5′-AAGCTTTTTTTTTTV-3′) as a primer, 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Lifetech Oriental), 400 μm dNTPs, and 10 units of RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen, Lifetech Oriental) as recommended by the manufacturer. After reverse transcription, the reaction mixture was treated with 1.1 units of RNase H (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 20 min and used for PCR as cDNA solution. PCR was performed in 50 μl of 1× PCR buffer containing 1 μl of cDNA solution, 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, and 0.5 μm primer pair. To distinguish four alternative exons (exon I, exon II, exon III, and exon IV) of the rat BDNF gene, E-I (5′-ACTCAAAGGGAAACGTGTCTCT-3′), E-II (5′-CGGTGTAGGCTGGAATAGACT-3′), E-III (5′-CTCCGCCATGCAATTTCCACT-3′), E-IV (5′-GTGACAACAATGTGACTCCACT-3′), and E-Vas (5′-GCCTTCATGCAACCGAAGTA-3′) were used. For the internal control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was amplified using GAPDH sense (5′-TCCATGACAACTTTGGCATTGTGG-3′) and antisense (5′-GTTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAGAC-3′) primers. For amplification of BDNF cDNA, the PCR conditions, after preheating at 95 °C for 10 min, were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min for 32 (exon I), 31 (exon II), 26 (exon III), and 29 (exon IV) cycles, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. GAPDH amplification was carried out for 31 cycles under the same conditions. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, and the densities of the DNA bands stained with ethidium bromide were analyzed using a Bit-Map loader (ATTO, Japan) and software (NIH Image 1.52). For the promoter analysis, the luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-BDNF promoter I (pBDNFpI), was constructed by ligation of pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) with the region (−528 to +138) of rat BDNF gene promoter I. The procedure for plasmid construction was described previously (18Tabuchi A. Sano K. Nakaoka R. Nakatani C. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As an internal control vector against the luciferase experimental vector, we used Renilla luciferase vector carrying the human elongation factor 1α promoter (pRL-EF1α) (7Tabuchi A. Nakaoka R. Amano K. Yukimine M. Andoh T. Kuraishi Y. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17269-17275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For the overexpression experiments shown in Fig. 9, we used β-galactosidase vector carrying the human elongation factor 1α promoter (EF1α-β-gal) as an internal control because pRL-EF1α itself could interfere with the assessment of firefly luciferase gene induction (data not shown). Plasmid pBDNFpI(Δ488–344) was generated by double digestion of pGL3-BDNFpI with BglII and SpeI, and blunted with T4 DNA polymerase (TaKaRa DNA blunting kit). The digested plasmid was then self-ligated. pBDNFpI(Δ378–349) was first generated by PCR with primers (forward A: 5′-GGATCCTCCCCTCCTAGCCTAT-3′; reverse: 5′-GCGACCGCGGCTTGAGTTGAATGAA-3′) to produce the fragment that corresponded to the upstream region from −528 to −379. After the fragment was ligated into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic vector (this plasmid was termed the up-vector), another PCR fragment amplified with primers (forward: 5′-TATCCGCGGCAACTAGTGGCTCGCCC-3′; reverse B: 5′CGCAAGCTTCCTGGGGCTGTGGCAAAGAT-3′) that corresponded to the downstream region from −348 to +138 was inserted into the SacII and Hind III sites of the up-vector. In the manner described above, a series of internal deletion mutants was then constructed: pBDNFpI(Δ357–331) (forward A, reverse: 5′-CGACCGCGGTGTAAGCCAAGCTCTC-3′; and forward: 5′-TATCCGCGGGTGCCTCTCGCCTAGTC-3′, reverse B), (Δ335–309) (forward A, reverse: 5′-CGCGATGGCCACTAGTTGCCCACAGGAA-3′; forward: 5′-CAATATGGCCAGTCCCTAAGAGGAAAAGGG-3′, reverse B), (Δ345–184) (forward A, reverse: 5′-ATTATGGGCCCACAGGAACCGGTG-3′; and forward: 5′-CGCGCTGGGCCCTAGAACAAGTCACTCC-3′, reverse B), (Δ277–184) (forward A, reverse: 5′-CGCGATGGCCACAACTTTCCCTT-3′; and forward: 5′-CAATATGGCCACGTCCGCTGGAGACCCTT-3′, reverse B), (Δ277–205) (forward A, reverse: 5′-CGCGATGGCCACAACTTTCCCTT-3′; and forward: 5′-CAATATGGCCATTTGATCATCACTCACGACC-3′, reverse B), (Δ277–223) (forward A, reverse: 5′-CGCGATGGCCACAACTTTCCCTT-3′; and forward: 5′-CAATATGGCCATCACCCCTCCCCCCC-3′, reverse B), (Δ288–245) (forward A, reverse: 5′-GCTAGAGGCCTTTTCCTCTTAGGGACTGAT-3′; and forward: 5′-CATATAGGCCTAGAACAAGTCACTCCTGCT-3′, reverse B), (Δ173–154) (forward A, reverse: 5′-CGACCGCGGACGTGGTCGTGAGTGA-3′; and forward: 5′-TATCCGCGGGGGAGGGGCACGAACTTT-3′, reverse B), (Δ151–114) (forward A, reverse: 5′-GCTATGGCCACCATGACTAAGGG-3′; and forward: 5′-TGCGCTGGCCAAGGGAGTCACAGTGAGTT-3′, reverse B), (Δ107–31) (forward A, reverse: 5′-GCGCGAGGCCTTGGTAAAAAGGA-3′; and forward: 5′-CATATAGGCCTCGCGCTGCGCTTTTCTGG-3′, reverse B), and (Δ107–65) (forward A, reverse: 5′- GCGCGAGGCCTTGGTAAAAAGGA-3′ and forward: 5′-CATATAGGCCTGGCCCCCTCCCC-3′, reverse B). The site-directed mutagenesis for the substitution of a few bases or for the deletion of 3–7 bases within pBDNFpI was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). CRE2m, TRE1m, TRE3m, CRE2Δ, TRE1Δ, TRE2Δ, and TRE3Δ were generated, using as forward primers, 5′-CAGTGAGTTGGTCACGGACCTGGCTCAGAGAGGCTG-3′, 5′-CCTTTTTACCAAGGGAGGACCAGTGAGTTGGTCACGTAAC-3′, 5′-GGTCACGTAACTGGCGACGAGAGGCTGCCCTGG-3′, 5′-GGGAGTCACAGTGAGTTGGTCTGGCTCAGAGAGGCTGCCCTG-3′, 5′-GAAGTTTCCTTTTTACCAAGCAGTGAGTTGGTCACGTAACTGGC-3′, 5′-CCAAGGGAGTCACAGTGAGCGTAACTGGCTCAGAGAGGCTGC-3′, and 5′-CAGTGAGTTGGTCACGTAACGAGAGGCTGCCCTGGCCCC-3′, respectively, and the complementary primer pair (underlined bases are substituted nucleotide bases). TRE2/CRE2Δ was generated by further deletion of 5 bases from CRE2Δ, using 5′-CCAAGGGAGTCACAGTGAGCTGGCTCAGAGAGGCTGCCC-3′ and the complementary primer. Expression vectors, A-CREB and A-USF, were generously provided by Dr. C. Vinson (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). DNA transfection was carried out over 3 days in culture and using calcium phosphate/DNA precipitation as already described (18Tabuchi A. Sano K. Nakaoka R. Nakatani C. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates were prepared by mixing one volume (100 μl) of plasmid DNA (6 μg, pBDNFpI:pRL-EF1α = 10:1) in a 250 mmCaCl2 solution with an equal volume of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH7.05), 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4), and added to each 60-mm dish. For overexpression experiments, we used plasmid DNA (6 μg, pBDNFpI:EF1α-β-gal:expression vector = 5:1:30). The dish was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh TIS medium added. After 40 h, the transfected cells were stimulated with 25 mm KCl (25 mm KCl stimulation) or vehicle for 6 h and cell lysates were prepared. For the dual (firefly and Renilla) luciferase assay, cell lysates were extracted with passive lysis buffer (Promega) and used as described previously (7Tabuchi A. Nakaoka R. Amano K. Yukimine M. Andoh T. Kuraishi Y. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17269-17275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For the measurement of β-galactosidase activity as an internal control, cell lysates were extracted with 250 μl of cell lysis buffer containing 1 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100; 30 μl of the lysate was used for the chemiluminescence-based β-galactosidase assay (CLONTECH), and 20 μl for the firefly luciferase assay. Forty hours after the medium exchange at 3 DIV, cells were stimulated with 25 mm KCl (25 mm KCl stimulation) or vehicle and incubated for 6 h. Then, nuclear extracts were prepared as described with minor modifications (20Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). EMSAs were carried out using probes corresponding to the BDNF-PI sequence (these are indicated in Fig. 4) as reported previously (21Tabuchi A., Oh, E. Taoka A. Sakurai H. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, end-labeling of DNA probes was performed at 37 °C for 20 min in 10 μl of reaction mixture (6.6 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 6.6 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dATP, 0.5 mm dGTP, 0.5 mm dTTP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 200 ng of DNA, 2 μl of [32P]dCTP, and 1 unit of Klenow fragments. Then, DNA probes were recovered with a Sephadex G-50 column. The DNA-protein binding reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 15 min in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.2–0.4 ng of 32P-labeled DNA probes, and 5 μg of nuclear extract). Then, DNA-protein complexes were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gel at 132 V for 2.5 h. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry. For supershift EMSA, a series of antibodies (2 mg/ml) was used at a dilution of 1:20. Although the complicated structure of the BDNF gene is suggested to give rise to at least eight species of BDNF transcript (4Timmusk T. Palm K. Metsis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1994; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (720) Google Scholar), it has already been reported that the exon III-containing transcript is the major form, the expression of which is controlled by BDNF-PIII in response to the Ca2+signals evoked via membrane depolarization in rat cortical neurons (8Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar,9Shieh P.B., Hu, S.-C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In addition, we have also reported that BDNF-PI is activated by membrane depolarization, the basal promoter activity being ∼8-fold less than that of BDNF-PIII (7Tabuchi A. Nakaoka R. Amano K. Yukimine M. Andoh T. Kuraishi Y. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17269-17275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Tabuchi A. Sano K. Nakaoka R. Nakatani C. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To confirm whether endogenous 5′-exon specific BDNF transcripts, particularly those containing exon I, are induced by membrane depolarization or not, we examined the increase in each transcript by RT-PCR. To distinguish each transcript, we designed a forward primer corresponding to exon I, II, III, or IV and a reverse primer corresponding to the common exon V (Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig.1 B, the expression of three transcripts containing exons I, II, and III was up-regulated by the exposure of cells to 25 mm KCl in medium (25 mm KCl stimulation), whereas the expression of the exon IV-containing transcript remained constant even after the stimulation. The minimum cycle numbers required for detecting transcripts by RT-PCR were 32 and 26 cycles for exon I and III, respectively (see the legend of Fig. 1), indicating that the expression level of the exon I-containing transcript is lower than that of the exon III-containing transcript. These findings indicate that BDNF-PI is activated by membrane depolarization in neurons although the expression level of the exon I-containing transcript is quite low, compared with that of the exon III-containing transcript. To assign the calcium (Ca2+)-responsive elements in BDNF-PI, we constructed a series of firefly luciferase reporter vectors containing various lengths of the promoter I region with internal deletions (see Fig. 2) for the measurement of promoter activity. Each vector was transfected withRenilla luciferase control vector driven by EF1α promoter (pRL-EF1α) into rat cortical neurons at 3 DIV. We previously reported that the luciferase activity derived from the vector carrying the region from −528 to +138 increased in response to the Ca2+influx through L-VDCC, which was caused by 25 mm KCl stimulation, suggesting the presence of Ca2+-responsive elements within the region up to nucleotide position −528 on BDNF-PI (18Tabuchi A. Sano K. Nakaoka R. Nakatani C. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the luciferase activities of plasmid vectors pBDNFpI(Δ378–349), -(Δ357–331), -(Δ335–309), -(Δ288–245), and -(Δ151–114) were nearly as inducible as those of pBDNFpI(full). Although the use of pBDNFpI(Δ488–344) decreased the luciferase activity, the deletion of the 5′-flanking region up to −310 (pBDNFpI(−311 to +138)) did not decrease the luciferase activity, compared with that of pBDNFpI(full) (data not shown), suggesting that the upstream region up to −310 is not so largely involved in the Ca2+ signal-mediated activation of BDNF-PI. In contrast, the use of plasmid vectors pBDNFpI(Δ345–184), -(Δ377–184), -(Δ377–205), and -(Δ377–223) resulted in a decrease in Ca2+ responsiveness of ∼40–60%, suggesting that this region includes the Ca2+-responsive elements. In addition, more marked decreases in Ca2+ responsiveness were observed with the deletion mutants pBDNFpI(Δ107–31) and -(Δ107–65), also suggesting a localization of elements responsible for a strong Ca2+ response in this region. We called these two regions the distal and proximal region, respectively. On the other hand, deletion of DNA sequences from −173 to −154 (pBDNFpI(Δ173–154)) rather increased the luciferase activity, indicating that DNA elements which function as silencers could be located within this region. As shown in Fig. 2, the proximal region from −107 to −65 was extremely effective in the activation of BDNF-PI. Therefore, we focused on the proximal region and investigated which DNA sequences within this region contribute to the activation of BDNF-PI. Using the TFSEARCH program (www.rwcp.or.jp/papia/) (22Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), we found that this region contained several candidate DNA-binding sites for transcription factors, such as CRE- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate -responsive element (TRE)-like sequences (Fig.3 A). To investigate the role of these sites in the activation of BDNF-PI, we constructed a series of plasmid DNAs having internal mutations and deletions at the sites and transiently transfected them into rat cortical neurons. As shown in Fig. 3 B, mutation and deletion of the downstream TRE-like sequence (TRE3m and TRE3Δ) did not affect the luciferase activity, whereas a series of mutants of the CRE-like sequence (CRE2m, CRE2Δ) showed a marked decrease in luciferase activity. Deletion of the middle TRE-like sequence which partially overlapped with CRE (TRE2Δ) resulted in the same decrease as with the CRE2 mutants (CRE2m, CRE2Δ). On the other hand, mutants of the upstream TRE-like sequence (TRE1m, TRE1Δ) were also effective in decreasing the transcriptional activity. However, the mutation combined with the deletion of CRE (TRE1/CRE2Δ) decreased the BDNF-PI activation to almost the same level as CRE2Δ, suggesting a minor contribution of upstream TRE to the activation of BDNF-PI. Among the mutant plasmid vectors constructed, plasmid TRE2/CRE2Δ with an 11-base pair deletion containing middle TRE- and CRE-like sequences was most effective in reducing the level of BDNF-PI activity, indicating that the DNA containing the CRE-like sequence and a few bases upstream of this sequence are mainly responsible for the activation of BDNF-PI. Additionally, we constructed a plasmid vector, pBDNFpI (Δdistal/CRE2m), with both a deletion of the distal region (Δ277–223) and mutation of CRE2 (Fig. 3 C). Compared with the luciferase activity of wild-type pBDNFpI(full), the activity of Δdistal was low, which was consistent with the data shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, Δdistal/CRE2m showed a greater decrease in luciferase activity than Δdistal, the level of which was almost the same as that of CRE2m (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that the proximal region, rather than the distal region, mainly contributes to the activation of BDNF-PI, induced by the Ca2+ signals in rat cortical neurons. We next investigated the transcription factors that could bind to the proximal region. To do this, we designed four kinds of native promoter I DNA probes (npIPb-1, -2, -3, and -4) to entirely cover the proximal region, and we performed EMSA (Fig.4 A, a). Among these four kinds of DNA probes, DNA binding activity was obvious with npIPb-2 and -3 probes (Fig. 4 A, b). For npIPb-1 and -4 probes, however, shifted bands were only faint. An increase in DNA binding activity induced by 25 mm KCl was observed with npIPb-1, -2, and -3, but the increase obtained with npIPb-3 was very weak. Addition of APV, an antagonist for theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R), or nicardipine, an antagonist for L-VDCC, tended to reduce the DNA binding activity of npIPb-1, -2, and -3 probes, but the reduction was very weak with npIPb-3. The doublet of shifted bands were observed only with probe 3. To investigate whether the binding to npIPb-3 probe involves the CRE-like sequence, we examined the competitive effect of a consensus CRE. As shown in Fig. 4 B (b), both the upper and lower bands were gradually erased when an excess of not only the cold npIPb-3 but also consensus CRE competitors was added. The mutation of two bases introduced into the CRE-like sequence (npIPb-3m1) failed to affect the DNA binding (Fig. 4 B, a andb). These results indicate that the CRE-like sequence in the proximal region functions as the CRE. The competitors containing a consensus TRE failed to compete with the binding to npIPb-3 probe, indicating that the TRE-like sequence on npIPb-3 was unable to function as the TRE. However, the binding to npIPb-2 probe was reduced by an excess of consensus TRE (data not shown), indicating that the TRE-like sequence on npIPb-2 probe functions as the TRE. These findings indicate that the CRE-like sequence"

https://openalex.org/W2042320968,"This investigation has elucidated a mechanism for development of macrophage foam cells when macrophages are incubated with native low density lipoprotein (LDL). LDL is believed to be the main source of cholesterol that accumulates in monocyte-derived macrophages within atherosclerotic plaques, but native LDL has not previously been shown to cause substantial cholesterol accumulation when incubated with macrophages. We have found that activation of human monocyte-derived macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulates LDL uptake and degradation and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-mediated esterification of LDL-derived cholesterol, resulting in massive macrophage cholesterol accumulation that could exceed 400 nmol/mg of cell protein. Cholesterol accumulation showed a biphasic linear LDL concentration dependence with LDL levels as high as 4 mg/ml, similar to LDL levels in artery intima. Protein kinase C mediated the PMA-stimulated macrophage uptake of LDL because the protein kinase C inhibitors, Go¨6983 and GF109203X, inhibited cholesterol accumulation. LDL receptors did not mediate macrophage cholesterol accumulation because accumulation occurred with reductively methylated LDL and in the presence of an anti-LDL receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody. LDL-induced cholesterol accumulation was not inhibited by antioxidants, was not accompanied by increased LDL binding to macrophages, did not depend on the apoB component of LDL, and was not down-regulated by prior cholesterol enrichment of macrophages. We have shown that the mechanism of LDL uptake by macrophages was PMA-stimulated endocytosis of LDL taken up as part of the bulk phase fluid (i.e. fluid phase endocytosis). The amount of LDL taken up with the bulk phase fluid was measured with [3H]sucrose and accounted for a minimum of 83% of the LDL cholesterol delivery and accumulation in PMA-activated macrophages. This novel mechanism of macrophage cholesterol accumulation shows that modification of LDL is not necessary for foam cell formation to occur.

Cholesterol accumulation in macrophages not only contributes to cholesterol retention within the vessel wall, but also alters macrophage biology. Cholesterol-loaded macrophages secrete plaque-disrupting matrix metalloproteinases, and produce tissue factor that promotes thrombosis when plaques rupture (1Lesnik P. Rouis M. Skarlatos S.

Low density lipoprotein (LDL),1 the main carrier of plasma cholesterol, enters the vessel wall and then by some mechanism enters macrophages. Previously, native LDL could not be shown to cause foam cell formation because the cellular receptor that binds LDL is poorly expressed on differentiated macrophages and down-regulates during cholesterol uptake, limiting total cholesterol accumulation (4Fogelman A.M. Haberland M.E. Seager J. Hokom M. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Koo C. Wernette-Hammond M.E. Garcia Z. Malloy M.J. Uauy R. East C.

Moreover, the LDL receptor is not expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques (8Yla-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Sigal E. Sarkioja T. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, most previous studies of macrophage foam cell formation have focused on modifying LDL in some way that increases its binding to macrophages. Increased macrophage binding of LDL has been achieved with chemical modifications to the apoB component of the LDL, aggregation of LDL induced by either vortexing or treatment of LDL with lipases, and complexing of LDL with other molecules, for example, glycosaminoglycans or antibodies, which bind macrophages and promote LDL uptake by piggyback endocytosis (9Kruth H.S. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D429-D455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages take up modified LDL by receptor-mediated endocytosis in pinocytotic vesicles, phagocytic vacuoles, or patocytic surface-connected compartments (9Kruth H.S. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D429-D455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One popular hypothesis of foam cell formation involves LDL oxidation. LDL oxidation promotes macrophage LDL uptake that is mediated by various macrophage scavenger receptors (10Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although oxidation of LDL has important biological effects that could influence atherosclerotic plaque development (11Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), oxidation of LDL does not readily explain foam cell formation. Incubation of human monocyte-derived macrophages with oxidized LDL, even strongly oxidized with artificial chemical systems, produces little macrophage cholesterol accumulation (12van den Eijnden M.M. van Noort J.T.

Atherosclerosis. 2000; 148: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, oxidized LDL is poorly metabolized within lysosomes of macrophages because of partial inactivation by oxidized LDL of the lysosomal enzymes that degrade LDL (14Hoppe G. O'Neil J. Hoff H.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1506-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Lougheed M. Zhang H.F. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol.

This limits the capacity of oxidized LDL to induce acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-mediated cholesterol esterification and cholesteryl ester lipid droplet formation, the hallmark of foam cell formation. In the present study, we have investigated how modification of macrophages rather than modification of LDL affects macrophage metabolism of the LDL. We show that macrophage foam cell formation can occur with native LDL when macrophages are activated with PMA. Activation of cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated uptake and degradation of native LDL. LDL uptake did not depend on macrophage oxidation of LDL or increased macrophage binding of LDL. Also, uptake did not depend on LDL apoB protein that could be removed by protease digestion without affecting LDL uptake. Rather, activated macrophages showed greatly stimulated uptake of LDL as part of the bulk phase fluid that the macrophages took up (i.e. fluid phase endocytosis). This produced cholesterol accumulation in macrophages to levels characteristic of macrophage foam cells in plaques. Human LDL and human lipoprotein-deficient serum were obtained from Intracel.

Two-week-old monocyte-derived macrophage cultures were rinsed three times with RPMI 1640 medium and then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with the indicated additions to RPMI 1640 medium. Reductively methylated LDL and acetylated LDL were prepared from LDL as described previously (18Basu S.K. Brown M.S., Ho, Y.K. Havel R.J. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7545-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 19Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before use, lipoproteins were dialyzed against 1 liter of 0.15m sodium chloride and 0.3 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) for 12 h at 4 °C, then against RPMI 1640 medium (two changes, 1 liter/each change) for 24 h. All dialysis was carried out with Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (10,000 molecular weight cut-off). After dialysis, lipoproteins were sterilized by passing them through a 0.45-μm (pore size) Gelman Acrodisc filter. All lipoprotein concentrations are expressed in terms of protein. Before adding to macrophages, 125I-LDL was dialyzed against 0.15 m sodium chloride and 0.3 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) for 36 h at 4 °C (three changes, 1 liter/each change). After dialysis, 125I-LDL was sterilized by passing through a 0.45-μm filter. 125I-LDL specific activity was adjusted to 2.25 × 10−5 μCi/ng by adding unlabeled LDL. Macrophage cell association and degradation of125I-LDL were determined according to the methods of Goldstein et al. (20Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein degradation was quantified by measurement of trichloroacetic acid-soluble organic iodide radioactivity in supernatants of media samples that were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Values obtained in the absence of cells were <5% of those values obtained with cells. These control values were subtracted. Cell-associated 125I-LDL was determined by rinsing macrophages five times (three quick rinses and two 10-min incubations all on ice) with DPBS plus Ca2+, Mg2+, and 0.2% BSA. After a final rinse with DPBS plus Ca2+ and Mg2+, macrophages were dissolved overnight in 0.1n NaOH at 37 °C or scraped into 1 ml of distilled water if cholesterol content was also to be measured. Aliquots of cell samples were assayed for 125I radioactivity with a gamma counter. Values were subtracted for 125I radioactivity determined for wells incubated with 125I-LDL but without macrophages. These values were <1% of the cell-associated125I-LDL. Unesterified and esterified cholesterol contents of macrophages and LDL were determined according to the fluorometric method of Gamble et al. (21Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages were harvested from wells by scraping into 1 ml of distilled water and then processed as described previously (17Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Macrophage and LDL protein contents were determined by the method of Lowry et al. using BSA as a standard (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein contents of cultures generally ranged between 0.2 and 0.3 mg/well. Fluid phase endocytosis was determined by incubating macrophages with 0.8 nmol/ml [3H]sucrose (specific activity of 12.3 Ci/mmol). After the incubations, macrophages were rinsed three times with ice-cold DPBS plus Ca2+, Mg2+ and 0.2% BSA and then three times with DPBS plus Ca2+ and Mg2+. Depending on the experiment, macrophages were either dissolved with 1 ml of 0.1n NaOH added to each well and incubated overnight at 37 °C or scraped from wells into 1 ml of distilled water. In both cases, 3H radioactivity was counted in an aliquot of cells using a liquid scintillation counter. The volumes of endocytosed fluid were calculated and expressed as μl/mg of cell protein. Cell-free wells were incubated with [3H]sucrose in parallel incubations and gave a background count less than 3% of the [3H]sucrose radioactivity detected in inactivated macrophages. The binding of 125I-LDL to macrophages was performed at 4 °C according to methods described previously (20Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent macrophages were rinsed three times with RPMI 1640, and then the macrophages were incubated on ice with 100 μg/ml125I-LDL in 3.5 mg/ml BSA-containing RPMI 1640 buffered with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). After a 2-h incubation, macrophages were rinsed three times with ice-cold Tris-saline buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, at pH 7.4) containing 2 mg/ml BSA, then incubated twice for 10 min on ice with the buffer. This was followed by one rapid rinse with the Tris-saline buffer without BSA. Next, the macrophages were dissolved in 0.1n NaOH overnight at 37 °C. Aliquots of the dissolved macrophages were assayed for 125I radioactivity and protein concentration. Nonspecific binding was measured in parallel incubations in the presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled LDL. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from the total binding. ApoB-free LDL was prepared by incubating 10 mg of LDL (5 mg/ml) with 5 mg of papain (10 mg/ml, 40 units/mg) and 0.4 ml of penicillin-streptomycin (penicillin at 10,000 units/ml, streptomycin at 10,000 μg/ml) in 0.6 ml of Tris-saline buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.15m NaCl, at pH 7.2) for 1 day at 37 °C. Then, 5 mg of fresh papain was added to the mixture, which was incubated another 1 day. After this incubation, the papain-treated LDL was purified by gel filtration chromatography through a 1.6 × 70-cm column of Bio-Gel A-50m-agarose gel eluted with DPBS containing 2 mmEDTA. This and all subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The papain-treated LDL particles eluted in the void volume fractions. These fractions were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon stirred cell with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off cellulosic filter. Before use, the papain-treated LDL particles were dialyzed against RPMI 1640 medium as described above for LDL and then passed through a 0.45-μm filter. Standard SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out to confirm that papain had digested the apoB component of LDL. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean. The means were determined from three culture wells for each data point. Standard error bars are not shown where the error range is smaller than the symbol size. Statistical comparisons of means were made using Student’s t test (unpaired). A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. PMA-activated human monocyte-derived macrophages showed a biphasic linear progressive increase in macrophage cholesterol content (from 71 ± 10 to 394 ± 19 nmol/mg of cell protein) during a 2-day incubation with 2 mg/ml LDL, similar to the LDL concentration in artery intima (23Smith E.B. Ashall C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 754: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Smith E.B. Eur. Heart J. 1990; 11, ( Suppl. E): 72-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hoff H.F. Gaubatz J.W. Gotto A.M., Jr. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 1424-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The rate of increase in cholesterol content was greater during the initial 3 h of incubation compared with the later hours of incubation. In contrast to macrophages incubated with LDL plus PMA, macrophages incubated for the same time with 2 mg/ml LDL without PMA showed only a slight increase in cholesterol content (to 117 ± 8 nmol/mg of cell protein). Incubation of macrophages with PMA and increasing LDL concentrations up to 4 mg/ml for 2 days showed a curvilinear nonsaturating increase in macrophage cholesterol content which reached a level greater than 400 nmol/mg of cell protein (Fig. 2). This resulted in macrophages loaded with phase-refractile lipid (Fig.3) similar in appearance to foam cells isolated from atherosclerotic lesions (26Jaakkola O. Kallioniemi O.P. Nikkari T. Eur. Heart J. 1990; 11, ( Suppl. E): 128-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol accumulation in PMA-stimulated macrophages incubated for 2 days with 2 mg/ml LDL reached levels of greater than 700 nmol of cholesterol/mg of cell protein in some experiments.Figure 2Effect of LDL concentration on PMA-stimulated macrophage cholesterol accumulation.

The bar is 80 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although our experiments typically were carried out without serum, the presence of serum did not affect macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Macrophages incubated with LDL and PMA in the absence or presence of 10% human lipoprotein-deficient serum showed similar amounts of cholesterol accumulation (data not shown). In addition, cholesterol enrichment of macrophages (by incubation of the macrophages with acetylated LDL for 2 days before incubation with PMA and LDL) did not decrease cholesterol accumulation induced by PMA and LDL. As shown in Table I, non-cholesterol-enriched macrophages accumulated an additional 297 ± 20 nmol of cholesterol/mg of cell protein, and cholesterol-enriched macrophages accumulated a similar amount, 301 ± 34 nmol of cholesterol/mg of cell protein.Table IEffect of prior macrophage cholesterol enrichment on PMA-stimulated macrophage cholesterol accumulationConditionMacrophage cholesterol contentnmol/mg cell proteinNo addition 2 days/no addition 2 days85 ± 4No addition 2 days/LDL + PMA 2 days382 ± 38AcLDL 2 days/no addition 2 days178 ± 12AcLDL 2 days/LDL + PMA 2 days479 ± 70Two-week-old macrophage cultures were incubated for 2 days with RPMI 1640 medium without any addition or with 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL (AcLDL) to enrich the macrophages with cholesterol. Then, macrophages were rinsed and incubated for 2 additional days in RPMI 1640 medium either without any additions or with 2 mg/ml LDL and 1 μg/ml PMA. After the incubations, macrophages were rinsed, harvested, and analyzed for their protein and total cholesterol contents. The increments in cholesterol content caused by LDL + PMA were similar whether or not the macrophages initially had been cholesterol enriched by incubating with AcLDL (increments of 297 ± 20 and 301 ± 34 nmol cholesterol/mg of cell protein without and with initial cholesterol enrichment, respectively). Open table in a new tab Two-week-old macrophage cultures were incubated for 2 days with RPMI 1640 medium without any addition or with 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL (AcLDL) to enrich the macrophages with cholesterol. Then, macrophages were rinsed and incubated for 2 additional days in RPMI 1640 medium either without any additions or with 2 mg/ml LDL and 1 μg/ml PMA. After the incubations, macrophages were rinsed, harvested, and analyzed for their protein and total cholesterol contents.

The effect of PMA concentration on macrophage cholesterol accumulation showed that between 0.3 and 1 μg/ml PMA produced maximal levels of cholesterol accumulation (Fig. 4). Thus, 1 μg/ml PMA was used in experiments. The effect of PMA was mediated through its action as an activator of protein kinase C. This was shown by the findings that each of two protein kinase C inhibitors, GF109203X (4 μm) and Go¨6983 (4 μm), completely blocked PMA stimulation of macrophage cholesterol accumulation (Fig.5A). In addition, another protein kinase C activator, bryostatin, stimulated macrophage cholesterol accumulation similar to that of PMA (Fig.5B).Figure 5Effect of protein kinase C inhibitors and activators on macrophage cholesterol accumulation.Two-week-old macrophage cultures were incubated for 2 days with 2 mg/ml LDL and either 1 μg/ml PMA plus 4 μm protein kinase C inhibitor (A) or 0.04 μm bryostatin, a protein kinase C activator (B). After the incubations, macrophages were rinsed, harvested, and analyzed for their protein and total cholesterol contents.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we determined whether the PMA-stimulated increase in macrophage cholesterol content was accompanied by uptake and degradation of LDL. PMA stimulated a curvilinear nonsaturating increase in cell association and degradation of 125I-LDL incubated at concentrations between 50 and 500 μg/ml, the latter being the highest concentration we tested with radiolabeled 125I-LDL (Fig.6, A and B). Without PMA, cell association of 125I-LDL also showed a curvilinear increase with increasing 125I-LDL concentration but reached a level that was only 38% of the level reached when macrophages were incubated with 125I-LDL plus PMA. Without PMA, degradation of 125I-LDL saturated above 250 μg/ml and was only 20% of the level reached when macrophages were incubated with 125I-LDL plus PMA. The net total 125I-LDL uptake stimulated by PMA (i.e. cell-associated + degraded125I-LDL with PMA minus cell-associated + degraded125I-LDL without PMA) was linear with increasing125I-LDL concentration (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, the total 125I-LDL uptake without PMA showed saturation with increasing 125I-LDL concentration. At 500 μg/ml 125I-LDL, the total macrophage uptake of125I-LDL was between five and six times greater in the presence of PMA compared with the absence of PMA (TableII). 78 and 83% of 125I-LDL taken up by PMA-treated macrophages for 1 and 2 days, respectively, was degraded, and a similar amount of 125I-LDL, 73 and 82%, was degraded by untreated macrophages (Table II). Thus, in both cases, macrophages degraded the majority of 125I-LDL taken up. In an analysis to be presented below, the amount of 125I-LDL taken up by PMA-stimulated macrophages could account for the increase in cholesterol content of the macrophages.Table IIPMA stimulation of 125I-LDL uptake by macrophagesIncubation timeTotal125I-LDL uptake+PMA:−PMA ratio−PMA+PMAdaysμg protein/mg cell protein12.8 ± 0.6 (73 ± 6)16.6 ± 1.0 (78 ± 5)5.928.3 ± 0.3 (82 ± 1)42.8 ± 2.4 (83 ± 2)5.2Two-week-old macrophages were incubated with 500 μg/ml125I-LDL for the indicated days without and with 1 μg/ml PMA. Then, media were collected, macrophages were rinsed, and cell-associated 125I-LDL was determined. Next, trichloroacetic acid-soluble organic 125I (i.e. degraded125I-LDL) was determined in the media samples. The total125I-LDL uptake was calculated as the mean of the sums of the cell-associated and degraded 125I-LDL determined in four separate experiments. Shown in parentheses is the percentage of the total 125I-LDL taken up which was degraded by the macrophages. Open table in a new tab Two-week-old macrophages were incubated with 500 μg/ml125I-LDL for the indicated days without and with 1 μg/ml PMA.

Shown in parentheses is the percentage of the total 125I-LDL taken up which was degraded by the macrophages. PMA-stimulated uptake of LDL led to ACAT-dependent cholesterol esterification. Incubating macrophages with LDL and PMA in the absence and presence of the ACAT inhibitor, S58-035, showed this. The ACAT inhibitor almost completely blocked accumulation of cholesteryl ester in the macrophages (TableIII). Simultaneously, the macrophage unesterified cholesterol content increased. This is consistent with the known action of ACAT to re-esterify lipoprotein-derived unesterified cholesterol after lysosomal hydrolysis of lipoprotein-derived cholesteryl ester (27Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ACAT inhibitor decreased PMA-stimulated macrophage cholesterol accumulation by 30% compared with macrophages incubated without the ACAT inhibitor. The decrease in macrophage cholesterol accumulation was not the result of a decrease in LDL uptake because the ACAT inhibitor had no effect on PMA-stimulated125I-LDL uptake (data not shown). The decrease is consistent with spontaneous efflux of unesterified cholesterol from the macrophages as we reported previously (28Zhang W.Y. Gaynor P.M. Kruth H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28641-28646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Table IIIEffect of ACAT inhibition on cholesterol accumulation by PMA-stimulated macrophagesIncubation conditionCholesterolEsterified cholesterolTotalUnesterifiedEster"

Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6317) Google Scholar). The two PR are identical except that PR-B contains an additional 164 N-terminal amino acids in the B upstream segment (BUS) (2Horwitz K. Alexander P. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 2195-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 3Krett N. Wei L. Francis M. Nordeen S. Gordon D. Wood W. Horwitz K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). As with other nuclear receptors, PR-A and PR-B have a multidomain structure, including a centrally located DNA-binding domain (DBD), which is flanked at its N terminus by an activation function (AF1), and at its C terminus by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and hormone binding domain (HBD) containing a second activation function (AF2). A third activation function (AF3) in PR-B maps to critical amino acid residues within BUS (5Sartorius C. Melville M. Hovland A. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K. Mol.

In most exogenous contexts, as well as on many endogenous genes, PR-B are stronger transactivators than PR-A (7Tung L. Mohamed M. Hoeffler J. Takimoto G. Horwitz K. Mol.

As a result of these isoform-specific functional differences, tissue responses to progesterone are profoundly affected by PR-A:PR-B ratios, which vary considerably among normal target tissues and breast cancers (11Arnett-Mansfield R.L. deFazio A. Wain G. Jaworski R. Byth K. Mote P. Clarke C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4576-4582PubMed Google Scholar). The multiplicity of regulatory effects that impact PR and other nuclear receptors is due in part to an intricate array of coactivators, corepressors, and cointegrators that are recruited to receptor-bound promoters (12Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Studies of coregulators have focused mainly on transcriptional activation, but transcriptional repression is also critical to understanding gene regulation. Repression can occur over entire chromosomal loci or by global targeting of general transcription factors (13Courey A. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar). However, transcription factor-specific repression also involves mechanisms such as direct interference with DNA binding, blockade of coactivator binding, or nucleosome remodeling by histone deacetylation (14Maldonado E. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Cell. 1999; 99: 455-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Of these, the interaction surfaces presented to coregulators by the receptors, possibly controlled by the DNA-binding site, are clearly important. For example, liganded glucocorticoid receptors (GR) are activators as dimers on palindromic DNA response elements but may be repressors in the monomeric state (15Lefstin J. Yamamoto K. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Even coregulatory proteins, like RIP140, PIAS1, and SRC1, can exhibit either coactivator or corepressor activity, depending on expression levels, the nuclear receptor target, and the promoter (16Ikonen T. Palvimo J. Janne O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 17Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thus, transcriptional repression can result from combinatorial influences on specific transcription factors and coregulators that together reduce binding affinity to the basal transcription apparatus, induce formation of impaired preinitiation complexes, target alternative promoters, or alter protein stability (18Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of nuclear receptors has also been variably linked to protein phosphorylation (19Takimoto G. Hovland A.R. Tasset D.M. Melville M.Y. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). These post-translational covalent modifications alter protein structure and protein-protein interactions, but in most cases, the mechanisms by which these modifications influence function are unknown. Phosphorylation of nuclear receptors regulates both their ligand-dependent and ligand-independent transcriptional activities (25Power R. Mani S. Codina J. Conneely O. O'Malley B. Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation, which targets nuclear receptors for degradation, paradoxically increases their transcriptional activity (23Lange C. Shen T. Horwitz K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Sumoylation, about which little is known, involves covalent binding of the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) protein. The prototype, SUMO-1, is a member of a family of ubiquitin-like proteins that are post-translationally conjugated predominantly to nuclear proteins (18Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S.

Like ubiquitylation, sumoylation uses a battery of activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligating (E3) enzymes for covalent attachment (30Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In contrast to ubiquitylation, polysumoylation does not occur, and sumoylation does not lead to protein degradation, at least directly. Instead, influences on a variety of cellular processes and pathways have been described, including effects on assembly of protein complexes that regulate DNA recombination and repair (31Melchior F. Hengst L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E161-E163Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S. Liu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The link between SUMO-1 binding and transcriptional repression is unclear given this multiplicity of cellular effects. However, recently, a novel synergy control (SC) motif was identified in the N-terminal region of GR (28Iniguez-Lluhi J. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and other transcription factors (27Muller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) that acts as a negative regulatory region. The SC motif has no effect when the transcription factor is bound at a single DNA response element, but it blocks synergistic activity resulting from cooperative DNA binding of a transcription factor to multiple DNA response elements. Intriguingly, the SUMO-1 consensus binding motif, ΨKXE (where Ψ is hydrophobic and X is any residue) is identical to the SC motif (28Iniguez-Lluhi J. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It follows that suppression of transcriptional synergy and repressor activities might work through a common pathway. We (37Hovland A. Powell R. Takimoto G. Tung L. Horwitz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5455-5460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and others (38Huse B. Verca S.

Deletion of all or part of thisautoinhibitory region in PR-A increases their transcriptional activity. This autoinhibition is also transferable to related nuclear receptors. When the PR IF domain is fused to the N terminus of human estrogen receptors (ER) (37Hovland A. Powell R. Takimoto G. Tung L. Horwitz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5455-5460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or chicken PR (39Giangrande P. Pollio G. McDonnell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32889-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), their transcriptional activity is repressed. Similar autoinhibitory regions have been identified in other transcription factors. Examples include c-Jun, c-Fos, and other members of the AP1 protein family (27Muller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), ATF-2, a member of the ATF/cAMP regulatory element-binding protein family, and Oct-2a, a lymphoid-specific transcription factor (40Li X. Green M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Atransrepressor activity, distinct from autoinhibition, also maps to the IF domain of PR-A. This activity is defined by the ability of PR-A to inhibit the transcriptional activity of PR-B, ER, or GR (38Huse B. Verca S. Matthey P. Rusconi S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,39Giangrande P. Pollio G. McDonnell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32889-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that distinguish autoinhibition from transrepression, both of which originate from the IF domain, are unclear. Recent attempts to precisely map these N-terminal repressor functions have led to ambiguous conclusions, identifying multiple, nonoverlapping regions (38Huse B. Verca S. Matthey P. Rusconi S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Giangrande P. Pollio G. McDonnell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32889-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have now identified a consensus SUMO-1-binding motif,387IKEE within the IF domain of PR that is responsible for and precisely maps both the autoinhibitory and transrepressor activities of PR-A and PR-B. Conservative K388A and K388R single point mutations of the Lys residue within this motif completely abrogate both repressor activities. Loss of repression is directly linked to the loss of SUMO-1 binding at the PR N terminus. Interestingly, SUMO-1-dependent repressor activities arising at the N terminus require the liganded C-terminal HBD, suggesting that the mechanism involves intramolecular communication between the N and C termini. The expression plasmids pSG5 hPR1 and pSG5 hPR2, encoding human PR-B and PR-A, respectively, and HEGO, encoding human ER, cloned into pSG5 were a gift from P. Chambon (Strasbourg, France). Wild type pEGFP-SUMO-1 and mutant pEGFP-SUMO-1G97A were gifts from J. Palvimo and O. Janne (University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland). To generate N-terminal deletion mutants of full-length PR-A or NTA (which contain the N terminus, DBD, and NLS of PR-A but lack the hinge and HBD), we used a 5′ sense primer containing an EcoRI site, a Kozak consensus sequence, and the ATG initiation codon. The 3′-antisense primer contained a stop codon and the BglII site. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pSG5 digested with EcoRI/BglII. For PR-B deletion mutants, the 5′ primer contained the in frameRsrII site located at the PR-B/PR-A junction, and the 3′-primers were identical to those used for PR-A. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pSG5 hPR1 or NTB digested withRsrII/BglII. Other deletions within PR-B and PR-A (PR-BΔ375–397 and PR-AΔ375–397), were created by insertingBamHI sites in PR-A at Pro375 and Ser397 by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and ligating the two sites to produce the deletion. PR-AΔ375–397 was then digested withRsrII/BglII, and the resulting fragment was ligated into RsrII/BglII-digested hPR1 to generate PR-BΔ375–397. To mutate the PR-A ATG initiation codon in PR-B, we used a 5′ primer containing an EcoRI site and a 3′ primer in which the ATG was mutated to GCG (Ala) and linked to anRsrII site. The PCR fragment was cloned into pSG5 hPR1 cut with EcoRI/RsrII. The point mutations, K388A and K388R, were generated by PCR using a 5′ sense primer in which AAG was mutated to AGG or GCG, respectively. The mutated fragments were introduced into pSG5-hPR1 or pSG5-hPR2 usingMluI/HindIII sites. All PCR-based cloning was verified by dideoxy sequencing. HeLa cells were plated at a density of ∼1.2 × 105 cells in 60-mm tissue culture dishes with 3 ml of minimum essential medium supplemented with 7.5% twice charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. Quadruplicate plates were transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation with 2 μg of the reporter plasmids, PRE2-TATA-luciferase (6Tung L. Shen T. Abel M. Powell R. Takimoto G. Sartorius C.

After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed, the medium was changed to 7.5% minimum essential medium supplemented with 7.5% twice charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum, and the cells were incubated with 10 nm of the synthetic progestin R5020, 10 nm 17β-estradiol, or both for an additional 24 h. The control cells received ethanol only. The cells were harvested, the lysates were normalized to β−galactosidase activity, and the luciferase activity was quantified with a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Lab., Ann Arbor, MI). Whole cell extracts were prepared from HeLa cells transiently transfected with PR expression vectors as described previously (37Hovland A. Powell R. Takimoto G. Tung L. Horwitz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5455-5460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The expressed proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with our anti-PR monoclonal antibodies, AB-52 and B-30 (41Estes P.

For detection of PR-SUMO-1 binding, HeLa cells cotransfected with PR-A, PR-B, or PR mutants and GFP-tagged SUMO-1 or SUMO-1G97A were collected in PBS containing 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and the cell extracts were prepared in modified RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide). The expressed proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and conjugated protein was detected by immunoblotting with AB-52 or an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

Transrepression refers to the ability of PR-A to suppress the transcriptional activity of PR-B and other nuclear receptors at low concentrations in which self-squelching is excluded (43Bubulya A. Wise S. Shen X. Burmeister L. Shemshedini L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24583-24589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 44Shemshedini L., Ji, J. Brou C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1834-1839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the transcriptional activity of ER from a promoter containing an ERE is inhibited by liganded PR-A even in the absence of a PRE. Self-squelching refers to the observation with transiently expressed PRs and other nuclear receptors (6Tung L. Shen T. Abel M. Powell R. Takimoto G. Sartorius C. Horwitz K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39843-39851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Hovland A. Powell R. Takimoto G. Tung L. Horwitz K. J. Biol.

The studies below were designed to address the mechanisms underlying the autoinhibitory and transrepressor properties of PR. We previously mapped IF to the large N-terminal region between residues 165 and 456 in the PR N terminus common to both isoforms (37Hovland A. Powell R. Takimoto G. Tung L. Horwitz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5455-5460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To map IF further, a series of N-terminal deletion mutants were constructed in PR-A and PR-B (Fig. 1A). A concentration (100 ng) of expression vector cDNA for each mutant that yields maximal activity without self-squelching (see Fig. 5) was cotransfected into HeLa cells together with a PRE2-TATA-luciferase reporter, followed by R5020 treatment. The transcriptional activities of the mutants are expressed as percentages of wild type PR-B activity. Stepwise deletions to residue 375 in PR-B (PR-BΔ165–315, PR-BΔ165–345, and PR-BΔ165–375) or PR-A (PR-AΔ290, PR-AΔ315, PR-AΔ345, and PR-AΔ375) had little effect on transcriptional activity compared with the wild type receptors. However, further deletion to residue 397 (PR-BΔ165–397, PR-AΔ397) resulted in 7.5-fold (PR-B) or 6-fold (PR-A) increases in transcriptional activity. These deletions map the autoinhibitory function to residues 375–397. Additional deletions to PR-BΔ456 or PR-AΔ427 lead to some loss of activity because of encroachment into AF1. The location of the autoinhibitory region within IF was confirmed with an internal deletion mutant (Δ375–397) in PR-B and PR-A. This 22-amino acid deletion increased the activity of PR-B 11-fold and that of PR-A 6-fold.Figure 5Δ375–397 and K388R mutants in PR-A and PR-B backgrounds; autoinhibition is lost but self-squelching is retained. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 10, 100, or 1000 ng of the receptor cDNA expression vectors indicated and 2 μg of PRE2-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid. The values are expressed as the fold induction over the no hormone control.A, relative dose-dependent activities of wild type (wt) PR-A (open squares), PRAΔ375–397 (closed diamonds), and PRA K388A (open circles).B, relative dose-dependent activities of wild type PR-B (open squares), PRBΔ375–397 (closed diamonds), and PRB K388R (open circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Selected N-terminal deletion mutants were then constructed in the background of NTA and NTB, the constitutively active N-terminal fragments of PR-A and PR-B, respectively, which contain the entire N terminus plus the DBD and NLS but lack the HBD (Fig. 1B). Constructs (100 ng) were transfected into HeLa cells and tested for transcriptional activity on PRE2-TATA in the absence of hormone. Analogous to their full-length counterparts, the activity of NTA is ∼10% that of NTB. This residual activity is due to AF1 and is entirely lost in the NTA ΔAF1 construct. Interestingly, in both N-terminal backgrounds (Fig. 1B), deletion of the autoinhibitory region (NTB Δ165−397 and NTA Δ397) identified in Fig. 1A failed to increase transcription. We conclude that the C-terminally liganded HBD is required for N-terminal autoinhibitory activity in both isoforms. Thus, residues 375–397 in the N terminus are necessary but not sufficient for full expression of the autoinhibitory effect. Fig. 2 shows immunoblots using the anti-PR monoclonal antibodies AB-52 (B + A-specific) and B-30 (B-specific) or the anti-DBD polyclonal antibody α266 to document protein expression levels of the wild type and mutant PR-A, PR-B, NTA, and NTB constructs used for the transcription studies of Fig. 1. They demonstrate good expression levels of all of the proteins at their expected molecular masses. The N-terminal autoinhibitory region defined by residues 375–397, contains an 387IKEE consensus SUMO-1-binding motif (Fig. 3A); the only one present in PR. Similar sites are found in GR and AR and in other transcription factors unrelated to PR. This motif binds SUMO-1 covalently. Such binding reportedly blocks synergistic transcriptional activity from promoters that contain multiple response elements for one transcription factor. To determine whether PR are sumoylated, PR-A were transiently transfected into HeLa cells together with GFP-SUMO-1 in the absence or presence of R5020 (Fig. 3B). Denatured cell extracts were prepared in N-ethylmaleimide to prevent GFP-SUMO-1 deconjugation (24Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O. Palvimo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the anti-PR antibody, AB-52, and the anti-GFP antibody. Lane 1 (Fig. 3B) shows the migration of unliganded PR-A. Despite the presence of GFP-SUMO-1, PR-A migrate at ∼97 kDa, the expected molecular mass of unmodified receptors. However, when R5020 is added (lane 2), a higher molecular mass PR band (∼140 kDa) is formed. That this is due to GFP-SUMO-1 conjugation to PR-A is shown in lane 4 using an anti-GFP antibody. These data demonstrate that PR-A are sumoylated but that this requires ligand binding. To confirm the HBD requirement, NTA and NTB, the constitutively active PR N termini that lack an HBD, were cotransfected with GFP-SUMO-1 (Fig.3C). Lanes 1 and 2 show the migration of NTB (∼97 kDa) and NTA (∼60 kDa) at the positions expected for the unmodified receptors. No higher molecular ma"

Previous findings have identified ganglioside GD3 (GD3) as an emerging apoptotic lipid intermediate that targets mitochondria in response to death signals. Using immunoelectron and laser scanning confocal microscopy, we characterize the trafficking of GD3 to mitochondria in response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in rat hepatocytes. In control hepatocytes, GD3 is present predominantly at the plasma membrane as well as in the endosomal/Golgi network, as verified by its colocalization with the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Following TNF-α exposure, GD3 undergoes a rapid cellular redistribution with a gradual loss from the plasma membrane before its colocalization with mitochondria. This process is mimicked by acidic sphingomyelinase and ionizing radiation but not by neutral sphingomyelinase or staurosporin. TNF-α stimulated the colocalization of GD3 with early and late endosomal markers, Rab 5 and Rab 7, whereas perturbation of plasma membrane cholesterol or actin cytoskeleton or inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase prevented the trafficking of GD3 to mitochondria. Finally, prevention of the TNF-α-stimulated neosynthesis of GD3, cyclosporin A, and latrunculin A or filipin protected sensitized hepatocytes from TNF-α-mediated cell death. Thus, the intracellular redistribution and mitochondrial targeting of GD3 during TNF-α signaling occurs through actin cytoskeleton vesicular trafficking and contributes to TNF-α-mediated hepatocellular cell death.

In addition to the proapoptotic function of proteins, ceramide is a pleiotropic signaling lipid that regulates multiple cellular processes including apoptosis (15Hannun Y.A. Luberto C.

In this regard, it has been shown that the levels of ceramide increase before the onset of cell death (17Grullich C. Sullards M.C Fuks Jr., Z. Merrill A.H. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8650-8656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that ceramide stimulated reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial permeability transition, and caspase activation in isolated mitochondria (18Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A.

Recently, it has been shown that the mitochondrial generation of ceramide by enforced mitochondrial targeting of bacterial sphingomyelinase induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells (22Birbes H, El Bawab S. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2669-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition to this role in apoptosis, ceramide provides the carbon backbone for the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids within the Golgi network (23Koller T. Proia R. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25859-25862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In particular, ganglioside GD3 (GD3), a sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipid, has attracted considerable attention due to its emerging role as a cell death effector. As with ceramide, the cellular levels of GD3 increase in response to Fas or TNF-α (24DeMaria R. Lenti T. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar,25Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Parı́s R. Fernández-Checa J.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), whereas the down-regulation of GD3 synthase, the enzyme responsible for GD3 synthesis from its precursor ganglioside GM3, prevents Fas- or β-amyloid-induced cell death (24DeMaria R.

Recent studies have indicated the ability of GD3 to reproduce the previously described effects of cell-permeable ceramide with isolated mitochondria, stimulating reactive oxygen species formation, MPT, and cytochrome c release (24DeMaria R.

Furthermore, theN-fatty acyl-sphingosine moiety, common for both ceramide and GD3, is required for the mitochondrial interacting function of sphingolipids (30Colell A. Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Roman J. Ballesta A. Fernández-Checa J.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1068-1070PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the available evidence in support of the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosome activation by GD3, the role of glycolipids in apoptosis is controversial as the inhibition of glycolipid synthesis enhances apoptosis, reversing multidrug resistance in cancer cells (31Lavie Y.

Recent findings in CEM cells have indicated the redistribution of GD3 by Fas or ceramide, inducing the colocalization of GD3 with ezrin (33Giammaroli A.M. Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. Gambardella L. Gradini R Fais S. Pavan A. Malorni W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or mitochondria (26Rippo M.R. Malisan F. Ravagnan L. Tomassini B. Condo I.

Therefore, the present study was undertaken to partially characterize the dynamic redistribution of GD3 and its mitochondrial targeting during TNF-α apoptotic signaling in rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were prepared by collagenase perfusion and cultured on rat tail collagen-coated dishes as described previously (34Morales A. Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Marı́ M. Colell A. Ardite E.

Fernández-Checa J.C. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were incubated with recombinant human TNF-α (Promega, 15–280 ng/ml) or exogenous sphingomyelinases from Bacillus cereus (in phosphate-buffered saline) or human placenta (in 50% glycerol, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 4.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (Sigma) as described before (35Garcia-Ruiz C. Marı́ M. Morales A. Colell A. Ardite E. Fernández-Checa J.C. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In some instances, cells were irradiated (4 grays) in a lineal accelerator (KDS Siemens) at room temperature as described before (36Morales A. Miranda M. Sánchez-Reyes A. Biete A.

Cells were treated withd-threo-PDMP, filipin, or latrunculin A before TNF-α exposure. Mouse anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody, clone R24 (Matreya, Pleasant Gap, PA), generated as described originally (37Pukel C.S. Lloyd K.O. Travassos L.R. Dippold W.G. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 155: 1133-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), displays a specificity for GD3 as characterized previously by compositional, partial structural analyses, immunostaining in thin layer chromatography plates, and immunoelectron microscopy (24DeMaria R.

Serrano (Centro Nacional de Biotechnologia (CNB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientı́ficas, Madrid, Spain), obtained from the serum of a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis, has been characterized previously and shown to recognize the E2 polypeptide of the mammalian mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (38Claverı́a C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4988-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Antibody anti-ASGPR was generated and characterized as described previously in our laboratory (40Calvo M. Tebar F. Lopez-Iglesias C. Enrich C. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1259-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab5 antibody and goat polyclonal anti-Rab7 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Treated cultured rat hepatocytes were fixed for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer prior to permeabilization with 0.1% saponin in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS buffer for 15 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies, mouse anti-GD3 antibody (1:500), human anti-mitochondrial serum (1:2000), rabbit anti-Rab5 polyclonal antibody (1/100), goat anti-Rab7 polyclonal antibody (1/50), or rabbit anti-APGPR polyclonal antibody (1/200), rinsed with PBS-0.0025% saponin, and incubated for 45 min with secondary antibodies. The anti-mitochondrial antibody was detected using a biotin-SP-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG (1:400) followed by a streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (BioSource International) (1:400), whereas the anti-mouse IgG-Cy3-conjugated antibody (1:200) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). After final washes in PBS, cells were mounted in Mowiol. Confocal images were collected using a Leica TCS-NT laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon-krypton laser and a ×63 Leitz Plan-Apo objective (NA 1.4). The number of cells observed per field was at least 70–100 per condition. Primary hepatocyte monolayers grown on Petri dishes were fixed at room temperature in 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mSorensen's phosphate buffer for 1 h. Cell were scraped, pelleted, and collected into cold fixative. Pellets were then washed in phosphate buffer and postfixed with 1% OsO4 for 1 h at 4 °C and dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol up to 80% ethanol. Resin infiltration was with LR White:ethanol (1:2 and then 2:1 at −20 °C for 1 h each) and then with undiluted LR White. For polymerization, each pellet was transferred to a gelatin capsule containing LR White for 48 h at 40 °C. Ultrathin sections were cut using a Lieca Ultracut UCT ultra-microtome and collected in Formvar-coated gold grids. For GD3 localization, grids were incubated for 10 min with 10% H2O2, rinsed in distilled water, and treated with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 m PBS for 30 min to minimize nonspecific staining. Sections were incubated for 2 h with GD3 anti-mouse antibody followed by a 10-nm gold-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (British BioCell International Ltd., Cardiff, UK). Sections were counterstained with 2% uranyl acetate (15 min) and lead citrate (3 min) and then analyzed and photographed using a JEOL JEM 1010 electron microscope. At least six grids for each condition were examined, counting 70–90 cells. When a magnification was ×30,000, three to five mitochondria per field were observed. Controls with secondary (gold-labeled) antibodies were performed, and no signal was obtained (not shown). HP was synthesized as described previously (41Shan X. Jones D.P. Hashmi M Anders M.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and used to selectively deplete hepatocellular mGSH levels (42Colell A. Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Ardite E. Marı́ M. Morales A. Corrales F. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were incubated with 1 mm HP for 5 min and then washed and fractionated into cytosol and mitochondria by Percoll centrifugation (43Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Morales A. Ballesta A. Rodés J. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Succinate dehydrogenase and lactic dehydrogenase activities were determined in either fraction to check for cross-contamination. GSH was determined in either fraction by high performance liquid chromatography. The survival of HP-treated hepatocytes following TNF-α (28–280 ng/ml) exposure was quantitated by measurement of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in culture supernatants and in the remaining cell monolayer after lysis with 0.1% Triton X-100, expressing the percentage of LDH release in the medium as the fraction of total LDH (medium plus cells). Apoptotic features of cell death were determined by the staining of cells with the DNA-binding fluorochrome H33258 assessing chromatin condensation by fluorescence microscope analyses or nuclear DNA fragmentation by gel electrophoresis. In some cases, hepatocytes were pretreated with cyclosporin A before exposure to TNF-α. Hydrogen peroxide and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined using dichlorofluorescein diacetate and tetramethylmethylrhodamine methylester from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Cells were incubated with the corresponding fluorescent probe, analyzing the fluorescence and side light scatter (SSC, 90° angle) in 10,000 events/test using a FACStar flow cytometer (BD PharMingen) as described previously (18Garcı́a-Ruiz C.

Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and are averages of three to five values per experiment and condition. Statistical analyses of mean values were made by one-way analysis of variance. Recent findings in T cell lymphoma CEM cells reported the colocalization of GD3 with mitochondria induced by cell-permeable ceramide (26Rippo M.R. Malisan F. Ravagnan L. Tomassini B. Condo I. Constantini P. Susin S.A. Ruffini A. Todaro M. Kroemer G. Testi R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2047-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the characterization of the trafficking of GD3 to mitochondria was not further pursued. To assess whether the mitochondrial targeting of GD3 occurs in response to death ligands, we monitored the mitochondrial colocalization of GD3 in rat hepatocytes following TNF-α treatment by immunoelectron microscopy using an antibody anti-GD3 whose specificity toward GD3 has been documented previously (24DeMaria R. Lenti T. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 26Rippo M.R. Malisan F. Ravagnan L. Tomassini B.

As seen in Fig. 1, TNF-α stimulated the presence of gold particles within mitochondria from hepatocytes treated with TNF-α. The stimulated trafficking of GD3 to mitochondria by TNF-α was observed after 4 h post-incubation (not shown). To follow the dynamic trafficking of GD3 to mitochondria, we monitored the distribution of GD3 in relation to different cellular markers. In basal conditions, most of GD3 was located at the plasma membrane and in the Golgi/endosomal region, as verified by the colocalization of GD3 with ASGPR (44Enrich C. Evans W.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 48: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2, A and B). In response to TNF-α, GD3 underwent a striking redistribution to intracellular compartments accompanied by its virtual disappearance from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, to assess the dynamic targeting of GD3 to mitochondria during TNF-α signaling, we analyzed the localization of GD3 with respect to mitochondria at different time points after TNF-α treatment. Hepatocytes were double immunostained using the anti-GD3 antibody and an anti-mitochondrial antibody that recognizes the E2 polypeptide of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (38Claverı́a C. Albar J.P. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martinez-A C. Torres M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7199-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39Ruiz-Vela A. Gonzáles de Buitrago G. Martinez-A C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4988-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In control hepatocytes, GD3 was predominantly located at the plasma membrane without colocalization with mitochondria (Fig. 3 A). TNF-α incubation induced a time-dependent redistribution of GD3; at 30 min after TNF treatment, part of GD3 was lost from the cell surface without mitochondrial colocalization (Fig. 3 B). However, by 1 h, the loss of GD3 from the plasma membrane progressed further with evident colocalization of GD3 with mitochondria as detected by the presence of yellow structures from the merged fluorescence of both channels (Fig. 3 B). These processes were completed by 3 h after incubation (Fig. 3 B). In comparing the redistribution of GD3 in relation to mitochondria over time, the disappearance of GD3 from the plasma membrane preceded its trafficking to mitochondria. The localization of GD3 with mitochondria by TNF-α has been detected in other cell types, such as human colon carcinoma cells HT-29, 2Colell, A., Morales, A., Fernández-Checa, J. C., and Garcı́a-Ruiz, C. (2002)FEBS Lett., in press. suggesting that the targeting of GD3 to mitochondria by TNF-α is not a cell type-dependent event.Figure 2Redistribution of GD3 and colocalization with ASGPR. In A, hepatocytes were left untreated or incubated with TNF-α (280 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time and then immunostained with anti-GD3 antibody followed by IgG-Cy3-conjugated antibody. In B, cultured hepatocytes were immunostained with anti-GD3 and anti-ASGPR antibodies and secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate. More than 100 cells were observed at different fields, and more than 80% displayed merged fluorescence of GD3 and ASPGR.

Obeid L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 45Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Incubation of hepatocytes with the Mg2+-dependent, neutral pH optimum neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase) from B. cereusneither altered the redistribution of GD3 from the plasma membrane nor induced its colocalization with mitochondria (Fig.4). In contrast, the acidic pH optimum sphingomyelinase (SMase) from human placenta ASMase, first characterized by Landsmann et al. (46Landsmann S Ferlinz K Hurwitz R. Bartelsen O Glombitza G. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and shown to enter cells by endocytosis becoming active in acidic compartment (35Garcia-Ruiz C. Marı́ M.

Med. 1998; 187: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), induced the loss of GD3 from the plasma membrane and its subsequent mitochondrial colocalization as determined by immunoelectron and confocal microscopy (Figs. 1 and 4). The mitochondrial targeting induced by the exogenous ASMase was blocked upon pretreatment of cells with monensin or mannose-6-phosphate (not shown). Furthermore, irradiated hepatocytes displayed a pattern of GD3 distribution similar to that caused by TNF-α and ASMase in which GD3 was lost from the cell surface and colocalized with mitochondria (Fig. 4). However, staurosporin failed to colocalize GD3 with mitochondria (not shown). These findings indicate that GD3 undergoes an intracellular redistribution targeting mitochondria in response to apoptosis stimuli other than TNF-α. To partially characterize whether the trafficking of GD3 stimulated by TNF-α was dependent on endocytic vesicles, we monitored the localization of GD3 with endocytic markers. TNF-α stimulated the colocalization of GD3 with Rab 5, a plasma membrane/early endosomal marker"

A two-dimensionally confining x-ray waveguide structure has been fabricated by e-beam lithography. By shining a parallel undulator beam onto the structure, a discrete set of resonant modes can be excited in the dielectric cavity, depending on the two orthogonal coupling angles between the beam and the waveguide interfaces. The resonant excitation of the modes is evidenced from the characteristic set of coupling angles as well as the observed far-field pattern.

Mutation of Gly111 and Gly113, which are part of the potential GGGTP S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding motif, completely abolished enzymatic function. Observed functional properties in combination with a recently published computer-based enzyme classification (Sofia, H. J., Chen, G., Hetzler, B. G., Reyes-Spindola, J. F., and Miller, N. E. (2001)Nucleic Acids Res. 29, 1097–1106) identifies HemN as “Radical SAM enzyme.” An appropriate enzymatic mechanism is suggested. coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase high performance liquid chromatography S-adenosyl- l-methionine The biosynthesis of the tetrapyrrole ring of hemes and chlorophylls requires the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen-III to form protoporphyrinogen-IX catalyzed by coproporphyrinogen-III oxidases (CPOs,1 EC 1.3.3.3) (1Chadwick, D.

During this reaction the propionate side chains of ring A and B of coproporphyrinogen-III are consecutively converted to the corresponding vinyl groups (see Fig. 1A) (5Jackson A.H. Jones D.M. Philip G. Lash T.D. Batlle A.M. Smith S.G. Int. J. Biochem. 1980; 12: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions molecular oxygen serves as one possible electron acceptor for the oxidative decarboxylation reaction. In the absence of oxygen alternative electron acceptors are utilized for catalysis. Therefore, at least two different types of enzymes for coproporphyrinogen-III oxidation are found in nature, one for the oxygen-dependent and another for the oxygen-independent reaction. The oxygen-dependent CPOs (HemF) were isolated and biochemically characterized from various eucaryotic sources. Three different enzymatic mechanisms were postulated based on the obtained results (6Yoshinaga T. Sano S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4722-4726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Medlock A.E. Dailey H.A. J. Biol.

Much less is known about the oxygen-independent CPOs. The oxygen-independent conversion of coproporphyrinogen-III to protoporphyrinogen-IX was studied in cell extracts prepared from various microorganisms including Rhodobacter sphaeroides,Chromatium strain D, Rhizobium japonicum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9Tait G.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Tait G.H. Biochem. J. 1971; 128: 1159-1169Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Seehra J.S. Jordan P.M.

In the absence of oxygen catalysis using cell-free extracts required the presence of MgSO4, l-Met, and ATP. In some experimentsl-Met was replaced by SAM, suggesting SAM synthesis froml-Met and ATP (9Tait G.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Tait G.H. Biochem. J. 1971; 128: 1159-1169Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Seehra J.S. Jordan P.M. Akhtar M. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). NADP+ was proposed to serve as a final hydrogen acceptor, and iron was shown to be involved in the catalytic process (14Tait G.H. Biochem. J. 1970; 118: 28-29Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). No data were available for the purified enzyme. Genetic approaches using R. sphaeroides and Salmonella typhimurium led to the identification of a genetic locus related to oxygen-independent CPO activity termed hemN. Inactivation of hemN led to coproporphyrin-III accumulation. Later thehemN genes of several bacteria including S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, R. sphaeroides, Ralstonia eutropha, and Bacillus subtilis were cloned and sequenced (15Xu K. Elliott T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3196-3203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Troup B. Hungerer C. Jahn D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3326-3331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Coomber S.A. Jones R.M. Jordan P.M. Hunter C.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 21: 3159-3169Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Some bacteria carry a second hemN-like gene termed hemZ. The gene product showed significant amino acid sequence homology to HemN and was also shown to be involved in oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen-III oxidation (18Homuth G. Rompf A. Schumann W. Jahn D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5922-5929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are no obvious similarities at the amino acid sequence level between oxygen-dependent HemF and the oxygen-independent CPOs HemN and HemZ. Common to all known HemN proteins is the conserved cysteine motifCXXXCXXCXC(The bold residues were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis in this study.). The motif including only the first three cysteine residues (CXXXCXXC) was also found in the amino acid sequences of all HemZ proteins as well as in other proteins including benzylsuccinate synthase-activating enzyme (BssD), biotin synthase (BioB), lipoate synthase (LipA), lysine 2,3-aminomutase (LAM), pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme (PFL-AE), anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase-activating enzyme (ARNR-AE), and spore photoproduct lyase (SP lyase) (see Fig.1B). In all these enzymes these three cysteine residues are part of an unusual Fe-S cluster (19Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Mu¨nck E. Fontecave M.

Moreover, all these proteins have in common that they use SAM as a cofactor to form a radical involved in catalysis. Based on these bioinformatic predictions a novel protein superfamily including HemN and HemZ was proposed (24Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 25Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Biol. Inorg.

Although there were a few biochemical studies, 20–30 years ago, on oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen-III oxidation (9Tait G.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Tait G.H. Biochem. J. 1971; 128: 1159-1169Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Seehra J.S. Jordan P.M. Akhtar M. Biochem.

Chem. 1974; 249: 6367-6371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme system that is responsible for this reaction was never identified or isolated. In this study we report the cloning of the E. coli hemN gene into an expression vector, its overexpression, and the purification of the recombinant protein to apparent homogeneity. An oxygen-independent CPO assay was established, proving for the first time that HemN is indeed an oxygen-independent CPO. The cofactor requirements for the catalytic process were elucidated. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the role of the conserved cysteine residues (Cys62, Cys66, Cys69, and Cys71) for [4Fe-4S] cluster formation and the importance of other conserved amino acid residues. A catalytic mechanism for the oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen-III oxidation catalyzed by HemN was proposed. A 1371-base pair fragment encoding all 457 amino acid residues of E. coli HemN was amplified by PCR using primer ND1ET3 (5′-TAGCCGCCACATATGCCATCG-3′) and primer BH13A (5′-AGCGGGATCCACTATTTAAATC-3′). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI (recognition sequences underlined in the primer sequences) and ligated into the appropriately digested vector pET3a to generate pET3ahemN. To exchange amino acid residues of E. coli HemN, the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides carrying nucleotide exchanges compared with the hemNsequence in the underlined positions were used to generate the mutants indicated: for Y56F, GCGTCCATTATCTCTCTTCGTACATATCCCGTTCTGCC; for H58L, GCGTCCATTATCTCTCTACGTACTTATCCCGTTCTGCC; for C62S, CGTACATATCCCGTTCTCCCATAAGCTTTGTTACTTCTGCGG; for C66S, CCGTTCTGCCATAAGCTTTCTTACTTCTGCGGTTGC; for C69S, GCCATAAGCTTTGTTACTTCTCCGGTTGCAATAAGATTG; for F68L, GCCATAAGCTTTGTTACCTCTGCGGTTGCAATAAG; for C71S, GCTTTGTTACTTCTGCGGTTCCAATAAGATTGTTACTCG; and for G111V/G113V, GCCAATTGCACTGGGTCGGCGTAACGCCGACG. All mutated genes were subjected to complete DNA sequence determination. E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying wild type or mutant pET3ahemN was grown under strict anaerobic conditions at 37 °C in Spizizen’s minimal medium (27Frey, P. A. (2001) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 70, 121–148Google Scholar) containing 10 mm NaNO3, 2 mm Fe(III)-citrate, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When cultures reached anA578 of 0.35, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. The cells were further cultivated for 1 h at 30 °C after induction and finally stored at 4 °C for about 15 h to allow iron-sulfur cluster formation. Subsequently the cells were anaerobically harvested by centrifugation. All further steps were carried out under strict anaerobic conditions in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories, Grass Lake, MI). All solutions used were saturated with N2 prior to use. The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 3 mmdithiothreitol). Cells were disrupted by a single passage through a French press at 1500 p.s.i. Cell debris and the insoluble protein fraction were removed by centrifugation for 60 min at 175,000 ×g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 30-ml Blue Sepharose XK26 column (Amersham Biosciences), which had previously been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer A to remove unbound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted using a 120-ml linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Recombinant HemN eluted at ∼600–900 mm NaCl. Fractions containing HemN were identified using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, Millipore GmbH, Eschborn, Germany). E. coli strains were grown anaerobically at 37 °C in Terrific Broth medium (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Vol. 3, Appendix 2.4. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to anA578 of 0.7. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. All further steps were carried out under strict anaerobic conditions in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories). The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3 mm dithiothreitol), and cells were disrupted by a single passage through a French press at 1500 p.s.i. Cell debris and all insoluble components were removed by centrifugation for 60 min at 250,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting protein solution (20 mg/ml) was stored at −20 °C. The BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit (Pierce) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was determined by Edman degradation. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry data were collected using a Finnigan Mat TSQ 7000 spectrometer. The analysis was carried out as described before (29Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For gel permeation chromatography, a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (AmershamBiosciences) was equilibrated using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated using glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Mr = 36,000), ovalbumin (Mr = 45,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr = 67,000), holo-transferrin (Mr = 80,000), alcohol dehydrogenase (Mr = 150,000), and amylase (Mr = 200,000) as marker proteins. A sample containing purified recombinant HemN was chromatographed under identical conditions with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For glycerol gradient centrifugation, the procedure used has been described in detail before (30Waldschmidt R. Jahn D. Seifart K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13350-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-bound iron was determined colorimetrically with o-phenanthroline after acid denaturation of purified HemN (31Lovenberg W. Buchanan B.B. Rabinowitz J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3899-3913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally the iron content of HemN was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy using a PE 3100 (PerkinElmer Instruments, U¨berlingen, Germany). The iron standards were purchased from Merck. UV-visible light spectra of purified recombinant HemN were recorded using a Lambda 2 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Instruments) under strict anaerobic conditions. The coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase assay was carried out under strict anaerobic conditions. Reaction components were mixed in an anaerobic chamber. All solutions used were saturated with N2 prior to use. The standard assay mixture contained, in a total volume of 300 μl, 50 μg of recombinant HemN (3.2 μm), 1.32 mg of protein of an E. colicell-free extract (S250), 0.5 mm SAM, 0.5 mmNADH, and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in buffer A. Further additions are indicated under “Results and Discussion” and in Table I. Coproporphyrinogen-III was prepared by reduction of coproporphyrin-III (Porphyrin Products Inc., Logan, UT) using sodium amalgam (32Grandchamp B. Nordmann Y. Enzyme. 1982; 28: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol (50 mm) was added to the coproporphyrinogen-III solution, which was subsequently adjusted to pH 8.0 using 20% phosphoric acid. The coproporphyrinogen-III solutions were stored at −20 °C. The reaction was started by addition of coproporphyrinogen-III (20 μm) to the assay mixture. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark, the reaction was stopped and formed protoporphyrinogen-IX was oxidized for 15 min to protoporphyrin-IX by addition of 30% H2O2. The amount of enzymatically formed protoporphyrinogen-IX was determined by fluorimetric detection of its oxidized form protoporphyrin-IX using a PE LS50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Instruments) with an excitation wavelength of 409 nm, an emission scan range of 570–680 nm, a scan speed of 200 nm/min, and a slit widths of 5 nm for emission and excitation.Table IRequirements for HemN catalysisHemN1-aPurified, recombinant HemN (3.2 μm) was used in the assay mixtures.Cell-free extract1-bE. coli cell-free extract (1.32 mg of protein) prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” was used in the assay mixtures.(S250)SAMNicotinamide cofactor0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100Other additions1-cCofactors and other additions were added to the assay mixture when indicated at the following concentrations: 5 mm MgSO4, 4 mm ATP, 1 mml-Met, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmo-phenanthroline.CPO activity1-dHemN CPO activity with the addition of cell-free extract (S250) and the cofactors SAM and NADH was measured, low background activity (below 10%) resulting from S250 addition was substracted, the obtained value was set to 100%, and all other measured CPO activities were related to that.%++0.5 mm0.5 mm NADH+−100−+0.5 mm0.5 mmNADH+−ND1-eND, not detectable.+−0.5 mm0.5 mm NADH+−ND++−0.5 mmNADH+−ND++0.5 mm−+−ND++0.5 mm0.5 mmNADH−−ND+Phenol-extracted0.5 mm0.5 mm NADH+−ND+Low molecular mass fraction1-fE. coli S250 was separated into a low and high molecular mass fraction by ultrafiltration through an Amicon PBGC membrane (relative molecular mass exclusion of 10,000) (Amicon, Millipore GmbH).0.5 mm0.5 mm NADH+−ND+High molecular mass fraction1-fE. coli S250 was separated into a low and high molecular mass fraction by ultrafiltration through an Amicon PBGC membrane (relative molecular mass exclusion of 10,000) (Amicon, Millipore GmbH).0.5 mm0.5 mmNADH+−44+Low + high molecular mass fractions1-fE. coli S250 was separated into a low and high molecular mass fraction by ultrafiltration through an Amicon PBGC membrane (relative molecular mass exclusion of 10,000) (Amicon, Millipore GmbH).0.5 mm0.5 mmNADH+−54++−0.5 mm NADH+ATP, l-Met, Mg2+21++1.7 μm0.5 mmNADH+−7++3 μm0.5 mm NADH+−10++5 μm0.5 mm NADH+−14++7 μm0.5 mmNADH+−16++10 μm0.5 mm NADH+−27++20 μm0.5 mm NADH+−41++40 μm0.5 mmNADH+−62++100 μm0.5 mm NADH+−100++500 μm0.5 mm NADH+−100++0.5 mm0.5 mmNADPH+−58++0.5 mm0.5 mm NADH++−27++0.5 mm0.5 mm NAD++−42++0.5 mm0.5 mmNADH+EDTA3++0.5 mm0.5 mmNADH+o-PhenanthrolineND1-a Purified, recombinant HemN (3.2 μm) was used in the assay mixtures.1-b E. coli cell-free extract (1.32 mg of protein) prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” was used in the assay mixtures.1-c Cofactors and other additions were added to the assay mixture when indicated at the following concentrations: 5 mm MgSO4, 4 mm ATP, 1 mml-Met, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmo-phenanthroline.1-d HemN CPO activity with the addition of cell-free extract (S250) and the cofactors SAM and NADH was measured, low background activity (below 10%) resulting from S250 addition was substracted, the obtained value was set to 100%, and all other measured CPO activities were related to that.1-e ND, not detectable.1-f E. coli S250 was separated into a low and high molecular mass fraction by ultrafiltration through an Amicon PBGC membrane (relative molecular mass exclusion of 10,000) (Amicon, Millipore GmbH). Open table in a new tab The samples for HPLC analysis were prepared from H2O2-oxidized assay mixtures (200 μl) by addition of 600 μl of 10% HCl and subsequent centrifugation for protein removal. 20 μl of the resulting supernatant were loaded onto a 3.9- × 150-mm μBondapakTM C18 reversed phase column (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) with a pore width of 120 Å. Separation was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using 17% (v/v) ammonium acetate (pH 5.2) in methanol as mobile phase. Tetrapyrroles were detected by fluorescence measurements using an excitation wavelength of 409 nm and an emission wavelength of 630 nm and in parallel by photometric diode array analysis for 200–650 nm. The HPLC system was the Jasco 1500 series (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). Coproporphyrin-III and protoporphyrin-IX (Sigma) were used as porphyrin standards. The E. coli hemN gene was expressed using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven system. Recombinant HemN was purified to apparent homogeneity using a single chromatographic step on Blue Sepharose. Fig.2A shows a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the different steps of the HemN purification. 5 mg of HemN/liter of cell culture were recovered. The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein was determined by Edman degradation and was found to be identical to the amino acid sequence deduced from the cloned hemN gene sequence (GVSMSVQ). Mass spectrometry confirmed the integrity of the recombinant protein. The native molecular mass of recombinant, purified E. coli HemN was determined using gel permeation chromatography in combination with glycerol gradient centrifugation. A relative native molecular weight of 52,000 ± 5,000 for HemN was deduced from both experiments. This is in good correlation with the calculated molecular mass of 52,734 Da and identifies E. coli HemN as a monomeric protein (data not shown). A recently published computational investigation of iron-sulfur cluster-constituting amino acid motifs (Fig. 1B) placed HemN in a class of SAM-dependent radical enzymes (24Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). In analogy to other biochemically characterized members of this enzyme family a model for HemN catalysis was postulated (see Fig. 4). In such a potential mechanism HemN obtains electrons from a flavodoxin-like system that is regenerated by a nicotinamide cofactor-dependent flavodoxin oxidoreductase. An electron is transferred to an enzyme localized [4Fe-4S] cluster (33Birch O.M. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19158-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Mulliez E. Padovani D. Atta M. Alcouffe C. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3730-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cluster subsequently transfers the electron to SAM with induction of a homolytic cleavage and the formation of a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. Transfer of the radical to the substrate with abstraction of a hydrogen yields a substrate radical. Final product formation requires an additional electron acceptor. To test this hypothesis a new anaerobic CPO assay was established. For that purpose purified recombinant HemN was incubated under strict anaerobic conditions in the presence of various cofactors and an E. coli cytoplasmic cell-free extract (S250) for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C with coproporphyrinogen-III as substrate. Formed protoporphyrinogen-IX and remaining coproporphyrinogen-III substrate were detected after oxidation to the appropriate porphyrins using H2O2 via fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC (Fig. 3, B and C). Maximal oxygen-independent CPO activity for recombinant E. coli HemN was observed in the presence of 100 μmSAM, 0.5 mm NADH, and unidentified cytoplasmic components (Table I). Almost complete conversion of coproporphyrinogen-III into protoporphyrinogen-IX was detected using fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 3B). The E. coliS250 used carried only insignificantly low CPO activity in the absence of recombinant HemN under these conditions. HPLC analysis of the reaction reconfirmed the almost complete conversion of coproporphyrinogen-III into protoporphyrinogen-IX by recombinant HemN (Fig. 3C). As described before (10Tait G.H. Biochem. J. 1971; 128: 1159-1169Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), using cell-free extracts of various bacteria the addition of ATP, l-Met, and Mg2+ to the assay partially substituted for SAM requirement, indicating SAM synthesis by the cytoplasmic extract. Several different nicotinamide cofactors were utilized by the enzymatic system with NADH yielding the highest enzyme activity (Table I). One explanation for the observed broad spectrum of utilized nicotinamide cofactors is their interconversion by enzymes present in the cytoplasmic fraction. The reduced nicotinamide cofactors could serve as substrate for an oxidoreductase for the generation of an electron donor like a flavodoxin. The addition of an E. colicell-free cytoplasmic extract was absolutely required to obtain CPO activity. We assume that the major role of the essential E. coli fraction (S250) in HemN activity was its assumed electron donor and electron acceptor function (see model in Fig.4). In agreement with this assumption phenol extraction and gel permeation chromatography of the cytoplasmic fraction identified proteinogenic components with aMr larger than 10,000 required for the efficient reconstitution of HemN-mediated CPO activity (Table I). The proteins of an electron donor system, like NADPH-dependent flavodoxin oxidoreductase and the flavodoxin, could represent these high molecular mass components. The assay mixture always contained a 0.3% (v/v) concentration of the detergent Triton X-100. Without detergent addition no CPO activity was detectable (Table I). As observed for other CPOsE. coli HemN might be membrane-associated in vivo(2Dailey, H. A. (ed) (1990) Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls, pp. 123–161, McGraw-Hill, Hightstown, NJGoogle Scholar), and sufficient solubilization is required for enzyme activity. Concentrated HemN solution was yellow-brown in color. An UV-visible light absorption spectrum recorded under anaerobic conditions revealed an increase of absorption at 320 nm and a major absorption peak around 410 nm (Fig. 2B). The observed absorption was continuously lost over a period of 24 h in the presence of oxygen. These features are typical for many proteins containing [4Fe-4S] clusters. To determine whether the spectroscopic features of E. coli HemN were due to the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster, the iron content of the protein was analyzed. Analysis using atomic absorption spectroscopy and a chemical determination method showed the presence of enzyme-bound iron that ranged from 1.3 to 3 mol of iron/mol of HemN monomer. These results indicated the presence of reasonable amounts of iron in HemN. However, due to the high level production of recombinant HemN in E. coli (up to 40% of the total cellular protein) only incomplete iron-sulfur cluster formation was achieved leading to the observed values. Appropriate variations in enzyme activity were observed. It is a commonly observed problem that iron incorporation into recombinant Fe-S proteins in vivo is incomplete (35Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, the iron-sulfur clusters are often reconstituted in vitro after purification of the apoproteins. However, we failed to improve the iron-sulfur cluster content of HemN by chemical methods. Further strong evidence for the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster came from the strong inhibition of enzyme activity by the addition of iron chelators (EDTA and o-phenanthroline) to the test system (Table I). Iron-stimulated oxygen-independent CPO activity has been described before (14Tait G.H. Biochem. J. 1970; 118: 28-29Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Amino acid alignments identified four clustered cysteine residues conserved in all HemN proteins (Fig. 1B). The fourth residue Cys71 is missing in HemZ and other SAM-dependent radical enzymes (Fig. 1B). To determine which of the four conserved cysteine residues (C62S, C66S, C69S, and C71S) is involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation and important for HemN activity all four cysteine residues were individually changed to serine residues. The mutated enzymes were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) under conditions identical to the wild type enzyme and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2A). The concentrated protein solutions of mutant HemN proteins C62S, C66S, and C69S were colorless, while the solution of mutant enzyme C71S was yellow-brown in color. The absorption spectra of the mutant enzymes were recorded under anaerobic conditions. For the mutants C62S, C66S, and C69S no absorption peak at 410 nm and no shoulder at 320 nm were detected in accordance with the colorless protein solutions. In Fig.2B the C62S absorption spectrum is shown in comparison to the spectrum of the wild type enzyme. The spectra of C66S and C69S were nearly identical (data not shown). Mutant HemN C71S revealed a distinct absorption maximum at 410 nm with a shoulder at 320 nm comparable to the wild type HemN absorption spectrum (Fig. 2B). Iron content analysis was performed for the mutant HemN enzymes C62S, C66S, C69S, and C71S. No significant amounts of iron were detected using atomic absorption spectroscopy and chemical iron determination for C62S, C66S, and C69S. For C71S 1.1–3 mol of iron/mol of protein was determined. These results, in agreement with the absorption spectra of the various HemN mutant enzymes, indicated that C62S, C66S, and C69S did not possess any detectable Fe-S cluster, while the mutant enzyme C71S still carried the cluster. Therefore, only the cysteine residues Cys62, Cys66, and Cys69 of E. coli HemN are essential for iron coordination, whereas Cys71 is not. These results are in accordance with the proposed sequence motifCXXXCXXC that HemN shares with the proteins of the Radical SAM family including HemZ (24Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The CPO activity of the four mutant proteins was tested (TableII). All four HemN mutants C62S, C66S, C69S, and C71S had lost their CPO activity. The loss of CPO activity for the HemN mutants C62S, C66S, and C69S was due to the missing Fe-S cluster. These observations underscore the importance of the HemN Fe-S cluster for the catalytic process. Although the fourth conserved cysteine residue Cys71 of HemN is not essential for iron coordination, it is important for catalysis. The exact role of Cys71 in HemN CPO activity remains to be determined.Table IICPO activity and iron contents of the HemN mutants C62S, C66S, C69S, C71S, Y56F, H58L, F68L, G111V/G113VHemN2-aHemN mutant enzymes were produced and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”CPO activity2-bThe CPO activity assay mixtures contained 3.2 μm HemN (wild type or mutant), E. colicell-free extract (1.32 mg of protein), 0.5 mm SAM, 0.5 mm NADH, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100.

Open table in a new tab Amino acid residues Tyr56 and His58 are adjacent to the iron-coordinating cysteine-rich motif. They are highly conserved in HemN and HemZ proteins. In the light of a potential radical mechanism one can speculate that Tyr56 is involved in catalysis by carrying or stabilizing an enzyme-localized radical. His58 could play a role as a potential fourth ligand for the iron-sulfur cluster. The highly conserved amino acid residue Phe68 lies within theYXHXPFCXXXCXFCmotif. Interestingly, a conserved aromatic residue (Tyr, Phe, or Trp) adjacent to the third cysteine occurs in all Radical SAM proteins (24Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). This aromatic residue (Phe68 for E. coli HemN) might function to lower the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur cluster (36Johnson M.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Finally, the glycine-rich sequence motif111GGGTP115 was proposed to be a potential SAM binding site (24Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). To test the function of these residues Tyr56, His58, Phe68, and Gly111 and Gly113 were exchanged by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzymes Y56F, H58L, F68L, and G111V/G113V were produced and purified under conditions identical to the wild type enzyme (Fig.2A). The results of our characterization of the mutant enzymes are shown in Table II. Mutation of residue His58, close to the cysteine residues constituting the iron-sulfur cluster, totally abolished enzyme activity. No iron-sulfur cluster was detected for mutant H58L. Therefore, His58 might be involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation in providing the fourth ligand besides the three cysteine residues in positions 62, 66, and 69. Mutant Y56F showed only reduced enzyme activity compared with the wild type enzyme making a central function of residue Tyr56 in enzyme radical formation unlikely. The observed partial loss of the iron-sulfur cluster by exchange of Tyr56 indicated a potential role of Tyr56 in cluster stabilization. Clearly, replacement of Tyr56 by Phe partially compensated for potential structural or catalytic functions of this conserved residue. Interestingly, mutant F68L was found to be as active as the wild type HemN. Double mutation of the glycine-rich motif (G111V/G113V) potentially involved in SAM binding totally abolished CPO activity. Additionally, a significant destabilization and partial loss of the iron-sulfur cluster was observed indicating close structural relation between the iron-sulfur cluster and the putative SAM binding site. Structural close contact of SAM to the iron-sulfur cluster seems to be important for radical formation (37Krebs C. Broderick W.E. Henshaw T.F. Broderick J.B. Huynh B.H. J. Am. Chem.

The first step in our mechanism is the reduction of the [4Fe-4S]2+ to a [4Fe-4S]+cluster by one electron followed by the homolytic cleavage of SAM to methionine and a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. Thereby the Fe-S cluster is oxidized back to the [4Fe-4S]2+ form. The 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the β-C atom of the propionate side chain of the substrate and generates the corresponding substrate radical. Stereospecific hydrogen abstraction from the β-C atom of the substrate propionate group during CPO catalysis has been reported previously (11Seehra J.S. Jordan P.M. Akhtar M. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During the final step the vinyl group of protoporphyrinogen-IX is formed, and CO2 is released. This step requires an electron acceptor for the remaining electron of the substrate. We thank Dr. E.

The expression of this gene was detected in various tissues in rats, including the lymphoid organs, central nervous system, mammary glands, and uterus. GPR7 mRNA was mainly detected in the central nervous system and uterus. In situ hybridization showed that the gene encoding the GPR7 ligand was expressed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of rats. To determine the molecular structure of the endogenous GPR7 ligand, we purified it from bovine hypothalamic tissue extracts on the basis of cAMP production-inhibitory activity to cells expressing GPR7. Through structural analyses, we found that the purified endogenous ligand was a peptide with 29 amino acid residues and that it was uniquely modified with bromine. We subsequently determined that the C-6 position of the indole moiety in the N-terminal Trp was brominated.

G protein-coupled receptor neuropeptide B Chinese hamster ovary phenylthiohydantoin 5-bromotryptophan 6-bromotryptophan high performance liquid chromatography nonbrominated neuropeptide W A large number of new genes have been discovered in the progress of analyses for the human genome. How to determine the functions of these genes is an important issue. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 play important roles in the regulation of physiological phenomena including sense, growth, reproduction, metabolism, and homeostasis. In the human genome, numerous genes have been found encoding GPCRs with as yet unknown ligands. The identification of ligands for these “orphan” GPCRs is a key to revealing their functions. In addition, since GPCRs have been historically important as drug targets, it is hoped that the identification of ligands for orphan GPCRs will bring new drug targets. We have developed our own unique methods to determine ligands for such orphan GPCRs on the basis of detecting specific signal transduction in cells expressing targeted receptors (3Hinuma S. Onda H. Fujino M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). First, we sought for ligands in tissue extracts and, subsequently, in a library with synthetic compounds. Recently, we have developed a method to search for genes encoding ligands in databases providing genomic and cDNA sequences. By utilizing these methods, we have already succeeded in the identification of several ligands for orphan GPCRs (4Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y.

Another GPCR, GPR8, sharing 59% amino acid identity with GPR7, has been also reported, but ligands for GPR7 and GPR8 have not been identified (1O'Dowd B.F. Scheideler M.A. Nguyen T. Cheng R.

By utilizing the Celera data base, we searched for candidate genes encoding ligands for orphan GPCRs. In this paper, we report on the identification of a novel gene encoding a ligand for GPR7. In addition, we show here that this endogenous GPR7 ligand purified from tissue extracts is a peptide modified with bromine. Celera Discovery Systems- and Celera Genomics-associated databases were used to search for genes encoding proteins with the motif of the secretory signal sequence. In our search, we found a gene, NPB, encoding a novel secretory protein. Based on the sequence information provided by the data base, we isolated a cDNA from human brain cDNAs by PCR using a primer set (5′-GTCGACATGGCCCGGTCCGCGACACTGGCGGCC-3′ and 5′-GCTAGCAGCGGTGCCAGGAGAGGTCCGGGCTCA-3′). We subsequently designed several primers on the basis of this human NPB cDNA and isolated rat, mouse, and bovine NPB cDNAs from brain cDNAs by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Utilizing several primers designed from the published sequences of human GPR7 and GPR8 cDNAs (1O'Dowd B.F. Scheideler M.A. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Rasmussen J.S. Marchese A. Zastawny R. Heng H.H.

The entire coding regions of NPB, GPR7, and GPR8 cDNAs were cloned, respectively, into the downstream region of an SR α promoter in the expression vector pAKKO-111H (9Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K.

A fragment of rat NPB cDNA (corresponding to nucleotides 224–393) was cloned into pBluescriptII KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

To determine the molecular structure of endogenous bovine NPB, mass spectrometry was performed with a Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Apex II, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ion source. To discriminate 6-bromotryptophan (6BrW) from 5-bromotryptophan (5BrW), peptide sequencing was performed on a protein sequencer (491 cLC; Applied Biosystems) with a modified gradient program. Phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-6BrW and PTH-5BrW were prepared, respectively, by coupling phenylisothiocyanate (Sigma) withdl-6BrW (Biosynth AG, Staad, Switzerland) ordl-5BrW (Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and converting to PTH-derivatives. To summarize briefly, the amino acids were reacted in 7:1:1:1 (v/v/v/v) ethanol/triethylamine/water/phenylisothiocyanate at room temperature for 20 min, dried, and then treated with trifluoroacetic acid at 50 °C for 10 min. After again drying, the reaction mixtures were treated with 1:1 (v/v) methanol, 2 nHCl at 50 °C for 10 min. PTH-derivatives were purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a C18 column (218TP5415; Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Peptides were chemically synthesized with an automatic peptide synthesizer (model 433; PerkinElmer Biosystems) according to an Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole protocol. l-6BrW was introduced into the peptides through enantiopure Boc-l-6BrW prepared by chiral separation. Receptor-binding assays were conducted principally according to our method previously described (4Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Briefly, the synthetic human nonbrominated form of NPB-23 (desBr-NPB-23) was labeled with Na125I using lactoperoxidase. Membrane fractions (1 μg) from CHO cells expressing human GPR7 were mixed with 125I-labeled human desBr-NPB-23 (100 pm) and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. To determine the amount of nonspecific binding, 1 μm unlabeled human desBr-NPB-23 was added to the mixture. The amounts of 125I-labeled human desBr-NPB-23 bound to the membrane fractions were measured after rapid filtration. In order to find novel secretory protein genes, we searched for candidate proteins with possible secretory signal peptides in hypothetical proteins deduced from human genomic sequences in the Celera data base. Since one of these candidates appeared to be derived from a novel secretory protein gene, NPB, we cloned a cDNA on the basis of the sequence information. We subsequently cloned NPB cDNAs in other species also. As shown in Fig. 1, these cDNAs encoded proteins with secretory signals. Homology among the proteins ranged from 53 to 92%, and they seemed to possess preproprotein structures. For example, human NPB contained an N-terminal secretory signal peptide with 24-amino acid length and potential sites (i.e.Arg48-Arg49 and Arg54-Arg55) for cleaving with proteases. We anticipated that the preproprotein we found might produce a ligand for orphan GPCRs. We therefore expressed the human NPB cDNA in CHO cells and examined whether ligands were secreted in the culture supernatants. The culture supernatants were screened by adding them to CHO cells expressing orphan GPCRs. The existence of ligands in the culture supernatants was determined by detecting specific signal transduction in the CHO cells. We detected specific cAMP production-inhibitory activities to CHO cells expressing GPR7 in the culture supernatant. Based on this, we purified a ligand for GPR7 from the culture supernatant. Open column chromatography was applied wherein the culture supernatant (2 liters) was boiled and then eluted through a C18 column (Prep C18125A; Waters) with stepwise increments of 10, 40, and 60% CH3CN in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Activity was detected in the fraction eluted with 40% CH3CN. Therefore, this fraction was purified serially through a HiPrep CM-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences) with 0–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm CH3COONH4 at pH 4.7, a RESOURCE RPC column (HPLC) with 15–30% CH3CN, a TSK-gel CM-2SW column (HPLC; TOSO, Tokyo, Japan) with 0.2–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm CH3COONH4 at pH 4.7, and a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column (HPLC; Amersham Biosciences) with 15–22% CH3CN (data not shown). The purified ligand for GPR7 that we thus obtained was then analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry (data not shown). Our results revealed that this purified ligand was a peptide consisting of the 24 amino acid residues WYKPAAGHSSYSVGRAAGLLSGLR, indicating that this peptide was generated from the preproprotein through processing. We could not detect any modification in the peptide purified from the culture supernatant. Shimomura et al.

Chem.10.1074/jbc.M205337200Google Scholar) have recently identified a peptide which acts as a natural ligand for both GPR7 and GPR8, and named it neuropeptide W (NPW). We found that our purified peptide and NPW shared 61% identity (Fig. 2), indicating that the two peptides are closely related, although they are derived from different genes. We analyzed the tissue distribution of NPB and GPR7 mRNAs in rats. Although the expression of NPB mRNA was detected in a variety of tissues, high levels were found in the lymphoid organs, central nervous system, mammary glands, and uterus (Fig.3, upper panel). Human NPB mRNA was highly expressed in the central nervous system (data not shown). GPR7 mRNA expression was mainly detected in the rats’ central nervous system and uterus (Fig. 3, lower panel). We subsequently conducted in situhybridization to detect NPB mRNA in the rat brain. NPB mRNA was found to be widely distributed here. Dense signals from antisense NPB riboprobes were detected in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. In the hypothalamus, specific signals were detected by the antisense probe in the medial preoptic area (Fig.4A), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (Fig. 4B), and lateral hypothalamic area (Fig.4C). In the hippocampus, moderate expression was detected in the CA fields of the Ammon’s horn but not in the dentate gyrus (Fig.4G). No hybridization signals were detected by a sense probe in the same areas (Fig. 4, D–F and H).Figure 4In situ hybridization of NPB mRNA in rat brain.A–C and G, hybridization with an antisense riboprobe.

After boiling, bovine hypothalami (2 kg) were homogenized in 1 m acetic acid. The resultant supernatant was then fractionated by open column chromatography through a C18 column with stepwise increments of 10, 40, and 60% CH3CN in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. We then fractionated the 40% CH3CN fraction through a HiPrep CM-Sepharose FF column with 0–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mmCH3COONH4 at pH 4.7. The resultant fractions showing the activities were precipitated with 66% acetone and again fractionated through a RESOURCE RPC column (HPLC) with 20–30% CH3CN. After precipitation with 75% acetone to remove proteins, these were fractionated serially through a Vydac C18 218TP5415 column (HPLC) with 20–30% CH3CN, a TSK-gel CM-2SW column (HPLC) with 0.3–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm CH3COONH4 at pH 4.7, and a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column (HPLC) with 16–24% CH3CN. In the final chromatography, the endogenous NPB was eluted as a single peak at 21% CH3CN (Fig. 5). As the N-terminal residue of the endogenous bovine NPB was expected to start from Trp25 in the preproprotein (Fig. 1), we analyzed its structure by nanoelectrospray ionization ion-trap mass spectrometry and MS/MS (data not shown). However, unexpectedly, the observed molecular weight (i.e. 3241.4 mass units) did not correspond to any lengths of peptides derived from the preproprotein and was 80 mass units higher than the calculated molecular weight (i.e. 3161.5 mass units) of 29-amino acid length bovine NPB. Consideration of the MS/MS spectrum and the isotope distribution of the signals suggested that the endogenous bovine NPB was modified with bromine at the first or second amino acid residue of the N-terminal. To confirm whether the endogenous NPB was indeed modified with bromine, we subjected it to electrospray ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry. The mass values and isotope distribution of (M + 5H)5+ ions (Fig.6A, upper panel) agreed well with the theoretical profile of brominated 29-amino acid bovine NPB (Fig. 6A,lower panel). N-terminal sequencing revealedXYKPTAGQGYYSVGRAAGLLSGFHR (X not identified), which corresponded to the sequence from Tyr26 to Arg49 in the preproprotein (Fig. 1). Only the PTH-derivative at cycle 1, which was expected to be Trp from the cDNA sequence, was eluted at a different retention time from that of a standard PTH-derivative. Therefore, Trp1 was determined to be the brominated residue. Bromination was originally reported in peptides derived from marine invertebrates, where Trp residues were found to be brominated at the C-6 position of the indole moiety (14Jimenez E.C. Craig A.G.

After preparing PTH-5BrW and PHT-6BrW as standards, we subjected the purified NPB to N-terminal sequencing by a protocol modified to fit these standards. The PTH-derivative peak at position 1 from the endogenous NPB coincided exactly with PTH-6BrW (Fig. 6B). Our results indicate that the endogenous bovine NPB has the following structure: 6BrW-YKPTAGQGYYSVGRAAGLLSGFHRSPYA. We could not detect NPB without bromination as a major component in the fractions obtained from bovine hypothalamic tissue extracts.Figure 6Structural analyses for endogenous NPB.A, (M + 5H)5+ ions in the electrospray ionization Fourier transform mass spectrum of the purified peptide (upper panel) and the theoretical isotope distribution of (M + 5H)5+ ions for NPB-29 (lower panel).

Synthetic NPB specifically inhibited cAMP production in CHO cells expressing GPR7 or GPR8 in various species (Table I). NPB inhibited cAMP production in cells expressing GPR7 more efficiently than those expressing GPR8. Both bovine NPB-29 and desBr-NPB-29 efficiently suppressed the forskolin-induced production of cAMP. We also measured the effects of NPBs on forskolin-induced cAMP production in CHO cells expressing human GPR8 and found that these peptides were less effective upon GPR8. We could not detect any apparent difference in the cAMP production-inhibitory activities between authentic NPB and desBr-NPB or between human and bovine NPB.Table IInteraction of NPB with GPR7 and GPR8Peptide1-adesBr-NPB, NPB without bromination.

Open table in a new tab To examine the binding of NPB to GPR7, we prepared human desBr-NPB-23 labeled with 125I at either of two tyrosine residues (Tyr2 and Tyr11). After iodination, we separated the two labeled peptides by HPLC using a TSK gel ODS-80TMCTR column (TOSO) with 48–58% CH3CN. The positions of the iodination were confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Since the agonistic activity of NPB was obviously reduced by iodination at Tyr2 but not at Tyr11 (data not shown), we used [125I-Tyr11]desBr-NPB-23 for binding assays. Scatchard plot analysis showed that the membrane fractions of CHO cells expressing human GPR7 had a single class of high affinity binding sites for [125I-Tyr11]desBr-NPB-23 at the dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.6 × 10−11m and maximal binding sites (Bmax) of 1.3 pmol mg−1 protein, indicating that NPB binds to GPR7 as a specific ligand with high affinity (Fig. 8). Even in the competitive binding assays, authentic NPB and desBr-NPB showed no difference in their inhibitory potency. Bovine NPB-29 and desBr-NPB-29 both efficiently inhibited the binding of [125I-Tyr11]desBr-NPB-23 (Table I), suggesting that bromination in NPB does not directly alter interaction with the receptor. In this paper, we have identified a novel brominated peptide, NPB, as an endogenous ligand for GPR7. Synthetic NPB showed very potent inhibitory activity to cAMP production in CHO cells expressing GPR7 and specifically bound to their membrane fractions with high affinity. However, we could not detect Ca2+ influx in the NPB-treated CHO cells (data not shown), suggesting that GPR7 coupled to Gi. NPB cross-reacted with GPR8, but its interaction seemed to be weaker than that with GPR7. These data indicate that NPB is a ligand principally directed to GPR7, although we do not rule out the possibility that NPB significantly acts as a ligand not only for GPR7 but also for GPR8 in some situations. In contrast, NPW shows agonistic activities to a similar extent on both GPR7 and GPR8 (13Shimomura, Y., Harada, M., Goto, M., Sugo, T., Matsumoto, Y., Abe, M., Watanabe, T., Asami, T., Kitada, C., Mori, M., Onda, H., and Fujino, M. (July 18, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M205337200Google Scholar), suggesting that NPB and NPW have different functions. In our structural analyses of endogenous NPB purified from bovine hypothalamus, we unexpectedly found that its N-terminal Trp was modified with bromine. Eosinophils reportedly generate a protein with brominated Tyr residues by reaction with peroxidase (16Wu W. Chen Y. d'Avignon A. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3538-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although the pathway to generate brominated Trp has yet to be discovered, it has been found in neurotoxic peptides (ς-conotoxin), which inactivate the excitatory serotonin-gated ion channel, derived from marine snails (14Jimenez E.C. Craig A.G. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Gulyas J. Rivier J.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,15Craig A.G. Jimenez E.C.

Science. 1998; 281: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This suggests that bromination in peptides occurs as a physiological phenomenon and not as an artificial event. N-terminal portions were well conserved in human, bovine, rat and mouse NPBs, even in NPWs. In addition, the agonistic activity of NPB was reduced by iodination of Tyr adjacent to N-terminal Trp. These data suggest that the N-terminal portions of these peptides are important in their interaction with receptors. However, we did not observe bromination in endogenous NPW. The reason why bromination is specifically observed in NPB is unclear at the moment. In addition, although we confirmed that all NPB samples purified from several different batches of bovine hypothalamic tissue extracts were brominated, it should be clarified in future studies whether bromination usually occurs in NPB under physiological conditions among different species. Previously there had only been two cases observed of structural additive modifications in neuropeptides. One is the sulfation of Tyr residues in cholecystokinin and gastrin, with a resulting increase in their biological activities (18Kaminski D.L. Ruwart M.J. Jellinek M. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: E286-E292PubMed Google Scholar). The other is acylation in ghrelin (19Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 403: 656-660Crossref Scopus (7101) Google Scholar). This peptide completely loses its affinity to its receptor if it is not modified with n-octanoylation at the Ser residue. Bromination in NPB is thus the third type of unique modification to be observed in neuropeptides. However, we could not detect the apparent influence of bromination on the interaction of NPB with the receptor in in vitro assays. In ς-conotoxin, the brominated Trp residues have been thought to be important to determine its pharmacological specificity (17England L.J. Imperial J. Jacobsen R. Craig A.G. Gulyas J. Akhtar M. Rivier J. Julius D. Olivera B.M. Science. 1998; 281: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the physiological significance of bromination in NPB is still unclear, this modification may affect in vivo activities. Since NPW has shown in vivo activities increasing prolactin secretion and food intake (13Shimomura, Y., Harada, M., Goto, M., Sugo, T., Matsumoto, Y., Abe, M., Watanabe, T., Asami, T., Kitada, C., Mori, M., Onda, H., and Fujino, M. (July 18, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M205337200Google Scholar), studies to examine the in vivo effects of NPB are in progress. GPR7 has been detected even in the rat and mouse brain, but GPR8 is reportedly absent in rodents (1O'Dowd B.F. Scheideler M.A. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Rasmussen J.S. Marchese A. Zastawny R. Heng H.H.

Brain Res. 1999; 71: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that NPB and GPR7 are widely distributed in various tissues in rats. Since both NPB and GPR7 mRNAs were detected in the central nervous system and uterus in rats, they might have some important functions in these tissues. In the hypothalamus, NPB mRNA was detected in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area. GPR7 mRNA is reportedly expressed in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (2Lee D.K. Nguyen T. Porter C.A. Cheng R. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 71: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, expressions of both NPB and GPR7 mRNAs were detected in the hippocampus. The distribution of NPB and GPR7 mRNAs in the rat brain suggests that NPB is involved in the regulation of feeding, the neuroendocrine system, memory, and learning, although these points should be examined in future studies. We believe that studies on NPB will provide new insight into not only modification in neuropeptides but also the regulatory mechanisms of brain functions. We thank Drs. Y. Sumino and H. Matsumoto for helpful discussions. We also thank Celera Genomics for the databases."
https://openalex.org/W2162295343,"Peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor α (PPARα) is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor family. PPARα is implicated in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism and in the control of inflammatory response. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a number of nuclear receptors are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Since PPARα exhibits a circadian expression rhythm and since PPARα is rapidly regulated under certain pathophysiological conditions such as the acute phase inflammatory response, we hypothesized that PPARα protein levels must be under tight control. Here, we studied the mechanisms controlling PPARα protein levels and their consequences on the transcriptional control of PPARα target genes. Using pulse-chase experiments, it is shown that PPARα is a short-lived protein and that addition of its ligands stabilizes this nuclear receptor. By transient cotransfection experiments using expression vectors for PPARα and hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin, it is demonstrated that PPARα protein is ubiquitinated and that its ligands decrease the ubiquitination of this nuclear receptor, thus providing a mechanism for the ligand-dependent stabilization observed in pulse-chase experiments. In addition, treatment with MG132, a selective proteasome inhibitor, increases the level of ubiquitinated PPARα and inhibits its degradation in transfected cells. Furthermore, MG132 treatment enhances the level of endogenous PPARα in HepG2 cells. Finally, transient transfection and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR show that inhibition of PPARα degradation increases its transcriptional activation and expression of target genes such as apoA-II and fatty acid transport protein (FATP). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PPARα is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in a ligand-dependent manner.

PPARα is highly expressed in liver, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and proximal tubular epithelium of kidney. A significant expression of PPARα has also been shown in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cells involved in the inflammatory process (1Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Inflamm. Res. 2000; 49: 1-9Crossref Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The ligands of PPARα are natural fatty acids and derivatives such as leukotriene B4 and 8-S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid or oxidized phospholipids from oxidized low density lipoprotein. The fibrates hypolipidemic drugs are synthetic PPARα ligands (1Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Inflamm. Res. 2000; 49: 1-9Crossref Scopus (762) Google Scholar). PPARα plays a role in intracellular fatty acid metabolism and in triglyceride metabolism by regulating genes involved in the transport and degradation of fatty acids in mitochondria and peroxisomes (2Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PPARα is also implicated in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. As a result, PPARα activation decreases the hepatic very low density lipoprotein secretion and plasma triglyceride levels (3Fruchart J.C. Duriez P. Staels B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARα agonists increase plasma concentration of high density lipoprotein particles by regulating the transcription of the major high density lipoprotein apolipoproteins (apo) in liver including apoA-II (4Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). PPARα regulates gene expression by binding, as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor, to specific DNA sequences, called PPAR response elements (PPRE), resulting in the transcriptional activation of target genes (5Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). More recently, PPARα has also been shown to play a negative role in the inflammatory response by interfering negatively with the AP-1 and NF-κB signalization pathway (6Delerive P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Physiological responses to nuclear receptor ligands not only depend on the potency of the ligand but also on the expression levels of the nuclear receptors in a given tissue. Regulation of nuclear receptor expression occurs at both protein and mRNA levels. For instance, expression of certain nuclear receptors is repressed in the acute phase inflammatory response (7Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16390-16399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This effect is very rapid, which suggests a tight control not only of nuclear receptor mRNA but also of protein levels, likely via a control of the degradation and stability of the nuclear receptors. Indeed, several nuclear receptors, such as the retinoid X receptor α, the retinoic acid receptor γ (8Boudjelal M. Wang Z. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J.

Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), have been shown to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This degradation pathway is implicated in the regulation of many short-lived proteins involved in essential functions of the cells, including cell cycle control, transcription regulation, and signal transduction (12Mimnaugh E.G. Bonvini P. Neckers L. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The proteins degraded by this pathway are covalently modified by fixation of an 8-kDa polypeptide, called ubiquitin, on lysine residues in a three-step process. In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). Then, the activated ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2). Finally, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) catalyzes the covalent bond of ubiquitin to the target protein. Following this process, multiubiquitinated proteins are rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome (13Hodges M. Tissot C. Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R749-R752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that PPARα mRNA and protein levels follow a circadian rhythm (14Lemberger T. Saladin R. Vazquez M. Assimacopoulos F. Staels B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1764-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that PPARα mRNA is rapidly down-regulated in the acute phase inflammatory response (7Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16390-16399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Since these responses imply a rapid regulation also at the levels of PPARα protein, the present study was designed to test whether PPARα protein levels are controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. Our results demonstrate that PPARα is an unstable protein that is rapidly degraded and that ligand activation stabilizes this nuclear receptor. Moreover, we show that the degradation of PPARα involves the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that its stabilization observed in the presence of the ligand is due to a decrease of PPARα ubiquitination. Inhibition of the proteasome increases the amount of PPARα protein and consequently the transcriptional activation of PPARα-dependent promoters. These results indicate that the proteasome plays an important role in the regulation of PPARα protein level, a mechanism contributing to the magnitude of ligand response.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% SDS) containing 4 mmorthovanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Labeling efficiency was determined by measuring the radioactivity contained in the pellet by precipitation of the proteins with 20% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min. The precipitated proteins were loaded on a filter under aspiration. After washes with 5% trichloroacetic acid, scintillated liquid was added to the filter, and the radioactivity was measured on a Beckman counter. PPARα was immunoprecipitated from 7 × 106 cpm using 4 μg of an antibody directed against amino acids 1–98 of PPARα. After one night of incubation at 4 °C under agitation, 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) were added for 30 min at 4 °C under agitation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 3,000 × g and were successively washed in 1 ml of RIPA, 1 ml of RIPA/1 m NaCl, 1 ml of RIPA/TNE buffer(v/v) (TNE buffer, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA), and 1 ml of TNE buffer. Laemmli loading buffer was added to the beads. After boiling, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. COS 7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Cells were transfected for 3 h with 2 μg of expression vectors for PPARα (pSG5hPPARα) and for HA-tagged ubiquitin (MT123-Ubiquitine-HA) (17Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D.

Then, cells were lysed on ice in RIPA buffer containing 4 mm orthovanadate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the BCA kit (Uptima Interchim, Montluçon, France). Immunoprecipitation of PPARα protein was performed on 150 μg of protein extract as described above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope. The blot was revealed with the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) (AmershamBiosciences) reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. HepG2 cells were treated with 40 μm MG132 for 2 or 4 h in the absence of serum and subsequently trypsinized and washed. Then, cells were resuspended in DMEM medium containing 10% FCS and 10% Me2SO, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and conserved at −80 °C. To prepare cytoplasmic extracts, cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g and resuspended in 5 ml of HB buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 15 mmNaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0,5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), centrifuged at 800 × gfor 5 min, resuspended in 200 μl of HB buffer supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. The pellet containing the nuclei was washed with 5 ml of HB buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 5 ml of HB buffer. Nuclei were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of HB buffer containing 360 mm KCl and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 ×g, and the supernatant corresponding to the nuclear extract was collected. The concentration of protein in the extracts was determined using the BCA kit. Twenty μg of nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blot using the anti-PPARα antibody. The blot was revealed with the ECL reagent. HepG2 cells were cultured in 24-well plates. Cells were transfected with 10 ng of PPRE-containing reporter plasmid J6-TK-pGL3 (4Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin.

After 24 h, cells were treated with 40 μm MG132 for 2 or 4 h prior to adding 50 μm Wy 14,643 or Me2SO for 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (16Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Pineda Torra I. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FCS supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate and non-essential amino acids. Cells were treated with 40 μm MG132 for 2 h prior to adding 50 μmWy 14,643 or Me2SO for 24 h. RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. One μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR using the LightCycler-FastStar DNA SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics) on the LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics) and as primers for human FATP, 5′-GGC GCC ACC CCG ACA AGA C-3′ and 5′-CGG GCT GGC ATG GAC CTC AC-3′ (fragment size: 325 bp), and as primers for human apoA-II, 5′-CAT GAA GCT GCT CGC AGC AAC TG-3′ and 5′-CTG GGC TCT TGA CCT TCT CCA TC-3′ (fragment size: 166 bp). As control, cyclophilin mRNA was measured using GCA TAC GGG TCC TGG CAT CTT GTC C sense and ATG GTG ATC TTC TTG CTG GTC TTG C antisense primers. For each primer pair, the linearity of the reaction was confirmed to have a correlation coefficient of at least 0.98 over the detection area by measuring a 10-fold dilution curve with cDNA isolated from HepG2 cells. Samples were analyzed in triplicate in three independent runs. Ct values, defined as the cycle number in which the detected fluorescence exceeds the threshold value (18Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5018) Google Scholar, 19Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), were determined for FATP and apoA-II and normalized to the Ct of cyclophilin using the following equation: relative values = 2(Ct cyclophilin − Ct target gene). To study the stability of PPARα protein, pulse-chase experiments were performed in COS 7 cells transfected with the pSG5hPPARα expression vector. PPARα protein was immunoprecipitated after a chase of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 24 h. In the absence of ligand, PPARα protein is rapidly degraded in cells (Fig.1 A). After 2 h of chase, the quantity of [35S]-labeled PPARα obtained was drastically decreased, indicating that PPARα is a short-lived protein. Since ligand activation has been shown to influence the stability of nuclear receptor proteins (20Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9287-9293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the effect of treatment with Wy 14,643, a PPARα ligand, was tested next. After 2 and 5 h of chase, a significantly higher amount of [35S]-labeled PPARα protein was observed in the presence of Wy 14,643 than in the presence of Me2SO (Fig.1 A), indicating that Wy 14,643 induces a stabilization of PPARα protein. Next, a more detailed time course was performed to determine PPARα protein stability in the presence and absence of ligand (Fig. 1 B). This experiment showed that PPARα presents a half-life of approximately 1 h in the absence of ligand and of approximately 2 h in the presence of Wy 14,643. Again, when compared with the vehicle-treated cells, slower degradation of PPARα protein was observed in the presence of Wy 14,643. Interestingly, this protective effect of the ligand was observed only during the first 3 h of activation (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate that PPARα protein is rapidly degraded in cells and that ligand activation stabilizes this protein in a transitory manner. To demonstrate the implication of the proteasome in the degradation of PPARα, a pulse-chase experiment was performed in COS 7 cells transfected with the PPARα expression vector and treated or not with MG132. PPARα protein was immunoprecipitated after 0, 2, and 4 h. In line with the data above, the results obtained show that PPARα protein is rapidly degraded in the cells. After 2 h of chase, a very low amount of [35S]-labeled PPARα proteins was observed, which became undetectable after 4 h (Fig. 1 C). In the presence of MG132, a stabilization of the protein was observed. After 2 h of chase, the quantity of PPARα protein was not reduced (Fig. 1 D). Since HepG2 cells express significant amounts of endogenous PPARα protein (25Martin G. Duez H. Blanquart C. Berezowski V. Poulain P. Fruchart J.C. Najib-Fruchart J. Glineur C. Staels B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), the influence of MG132 on endogenous PPARα level was analyzed. Western blot analysis using a specific PPARα antiserum demonstrated that treatment of HepG2 cells with MG132 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and3) resulted in a significant increase of endogenous PPARα proteins levels (Fig. 2, lane 1). These results indicate that both endogenously and exogenously expressed PPARα proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. A number of nuclear receptors are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (8Boudjelal M. Wang Z. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 8: 2247-2252Google Scholar, 9Kopf E. Plassat J.L.

To determine whether PPARα is also degraded by this system, COS 7 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for PPARα and an HA epitope-tagged ubiquitin. After treatment with Wy 14,643 or vehicle for 5 h, PPARα proteins were immunoprecipitated, and the ubiquitinated PPARα proteins were revealed with an anti-HA antibody. The results from this experiment show that PPARα is ubiquitinated (Fig.3, lane 3). The high molecular weight of the ubiquitinated PPARα proteins suggests the presence of numerous ubiquitination sites. Addition of Wy 14,643 decreased the amount of ubiquitinated PPARα protein (Fig. 3, lane 4), data that are in line with the stabilization effect of the ligand obtained in the pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 1). To determine whether the ubiquitinated PPARα protein is degraded by the proteasome, COS 7 cells transfected with an expression vector for PPARα were treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, which inhibits the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins by the 26 S proteasome complex. In the presence of this inhibitor, an increase of ubiquitinated PPARα protein was observed in cells treated or not with Wy 14,643 (Fig. 3,lanes 5 and 6). These results show that ubiquitinated PPARα protein is degraded by the proteasome. To confirm that the effect of Wy 14,643 on PPARα ubiquitination is a ligand-specific effect, the influence of other PPARα ligands, including clinically used fibrates and the highly specific PPARα agonist GW7647, were analyzed next. In addition, the influence of cerivastatin, which is not a PPARα ligand but which is known to activate this nuclear receptor by modulating its phosphorylation status (25Martin G. Duez H. Blanquart C. Berezowski V. Poulain P. Fruchart J.C. Najib-Fruchart J. Glineur C. Staels B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), was tested. The results obtained show that the decrease in PPARα ubiquitination was observed only with the PPARα ligands but not with cerivastatin (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that PPARα is ubiquitinated and that ligand activation decreases PPARα protein ubiquitination.Figure 4Treatment with PPAR α ligands decreases the ubiquitination of PPARα protein.COS 7 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged ubiquitin and pSG5hPPARα expression vectors. Cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO or H2O) or the different ligands for 5 h. Immunoprecipitated PPARα proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. HA-tagged proteins were revealed with a monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope (A). As control for transfection efficiency, 20 μg of cell lysate were analyzed by Western blot using an antibody against PPARα (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the consequence of inhibition of PPARα degradation on its transcriptional activity, HepG2 cells were transfected with a reporter vector containing the J site PPRE of the apoA-II gene promoter (J6-TK-pGL3) or with the control reporter vector TK-pGL3 and treated or not with MG132 for 2 and 4 h prior to activation with the Wy 14,643 compound. In cells transfected with the TK-pGL3, no modification of the reporter activity was induced by the treatment with Wy 14,643 and MG132 (Fig.5). In the untreated cells transfected with the J6-TK-pGL3, a 2-fold activation of reporter activity was observed in the presence of Wy 14,643 as compared with vehicle (Fig.5). Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with MG132 increased both the basal and ligand-stimulated transcriptional activation of the reporter gene. This effect was already observed when the cells were pretreated for 2 h with MG132 and was even more pronounced after 4 h (Fig.5). To determine whether this stabilization of PPARα protein by MG132 resulted in changes in PPARα target gene expression, HepG2 cells were treated or not with MG132 for 2 h prior to activation with Wy 14,643, and the expression level of two established PPARα target genes, apoA-II (4Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and FATP (26Frohnert B.I. Hui T.Y. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3970-3977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), was analyzed by quantitative PCR. Pretreatment with MG132 increased Wy 14,643-induced expression of both the apoA-II (Fig. 6 A) and FATP (Fig. 6 B) genes. These data show that MG132 stabilization of PPARα protein levels results in an enhanced ligand-induced expression of PPARα target genes in HepG2 cells. Eukaryotic cells exhibit rigorous control over gene expression by tightly regulating the expression and activity of transcription factor proteins. The concentrations of these transcriptional regulators are controlled, at least in part, through proteasome-mediated protein degradation. The first step in this process, the ubiquitination of proteins, which are subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex, is a highly regulated process leading to the modulation of transcription factor activity (13Hodges M. Tissot C. Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R749-R752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, it is shown that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway controls the degradation of PPARα protein and as such modulates the concentration of PPARα in hepatocytes. Results from pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that PPARα protein has a short half-life, which is extended by liganding of the receptor, results that confirm and extend data that appeared when this work was in progress (27Hirotani M. Tsukamoto T. Bourdeaux J. Sadano H. Osumi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that PPARα protein stabilization by its ligand is associated with a reduction in ubiquitination of PPARα protein. Furthermore, a highly specific inhibitor of the proteasome, MG132, blocks PPARα protein degradation, and the resulting enhanced expression of PPARα leads to a higher transcriptional activation of a reporter gene driven by a PPAR-responsive element. In addition, treatment of HepG2 cells with MG132 results in an enhanced ligand-induced expression of endogenous PPARα-responsive genes. Recently, it was demonstrated that elevating expression of PPARα in HepG2 cells by overexpressing exogenous PPARα results in an increased expression of endogenous PPARα target genes (28Hsu M.H. Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27950-27958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), whereas genetic ablation of PPARα expression results in decreased basal and/or ligand-induced expression of PPARα target genes (29Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), indicating that PPARα protein levels are a determinant of the response to its ligands. The results from this study, demonstrating that PPARα protein expression and activity are regulated at the level of degradation, thus provide a novel mechanism of control of PPARα activity. Although only a limited number of studies have addressed PPARα protein regulation, the concentration of PPARα has been shown to be critical under a number of physiological situations. PPARα expression has been shown to oscillate with a circadian rhythm in liver (14Lemberger T. Saladin R. Vazquez M. Assimacopoulos F. Staels B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1764-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The diurnal variations of PPARα mRNA is closely followed by a parallel cycling of PPARα protein. This rapid diurnal cycling of PPARα protein levels implied that the half-life of the protein should be short enough to allow its levels to significantly decrease over a period of 12 h. Our results from pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that PPARα protein half-life is approximately 1 h due to its rapid degradation by the proteasome, which provides a molecular mechanism potentially contributing to the rapid circadian cycling of this protein. Furthermore, our data indicate that regulation of PPARα protein level by controlling its degradation modulates the expression of different PPARα target genes in response to its ligand. For example, the expression of the apoA-II and FATP genes, two well characterized PPARα target genes (4Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 26Frohnert B.I. Hui T.Y. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3970-3977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), by MG132 treatment is increased in a ligand-dependent manner. Thus, in addition to PPARα control by the level of its gene transcription as well as by the potency of the ligand, the magnitude of the physiological response to PPARα activation is also regulated at the level of its stability. It will be of interest to identify physiological factors that influence PPARα degradation and as such affect the PPARα signaling pathway. Interestingly, our study shows that ligand activation protects PPARα from ubiquitination and degradation in a rapid but transient manner. Previous studies demonstrated that the estrogen and vitamin D3 receptors are also degraded by the proteasome and that this is accelerated after ligand exposure (20Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 21Masuyama H. MacDonald P.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similarly, progesterone receptor protein levels are down-regulated after progesterone treatment (22Turgeon J.L. Waring D.W. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3422-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Syvala H. Vienonen A. Zhuang Y.H. Kivineva M. Ylikomi T. Tuohimaa P. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other results clearly indicate a hormone-mediated destabilization of the glucocorticoid receptor (24Webster J.C. Jewell C.M. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9287-9293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, glucocorticoid receptor has a fairly long half-life of 18 h, whereas dexamethasone-treatment decreases its half-life to 8–9 h. In contrast to the previous receptors, PPARα has a very short half-life, and ligand activation prolongs its half-life. We therefore propose a model in which the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may contribute to the regulation of duration and magnitude of the response to PPARα activators. The interaction with its ligand reduces the ubiquitination of the PPARα protein and consequently its degradation. This protective effect appears transitory, which may be due either to a rapid metabolization of the ligand in liver cells and/or to a ligand-dependent recruitment of coactivators that could induce the degradation of the PPARα protein. Indeed, it has been shown previously that the AF-2 domain of certain nuclear receptors binds a component of the proteasome in a hormone-dependent manner (30Vom Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J. Garnier J.M. Vivat V., Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which may result in the arrest of the transcriptional activation by the liganded receptor in a temporally defined manner. Further investigation is necessary to identify the mechanisms explaining the transitory stabilization of PPARα protein by its ligand.

Erythroidine is an alkaloid with curare-like activity that is isolated from the seeds of the trees and shrubs of the genus Erythrina. Methyllycaconitine is a tertiary diterpenoid isolated from the seeds of Delphinium brownii(the larkspur plant). Larkspurs are widely distributed in western North America and they kill more cattle on range lands than any other poisonous plant (8Majak W. McDiarmid R.E. Hall J.W. Willms W. J. Range Mgmt. 2000; 53: 207-210Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Neosurugatoxin is the primary toxin component of the Japanese ivory mollusc, Babylonia japonica (9Hayashi E. Isogai M. Kagawa Y. Takayanagi N. Yamada S. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Among toxins used by venomous organisms to capture prey, the most well known examples are the snake venom polypeptides. More than 90 neurotoxin antagonists of nAChRs have been isolated from dozens of species of land and sea snakes of the Elapidae and Hydrophidae families. The α-neurotoxins are a dominant component of snake venoms. The most extensively characterized α-neurotoxin is α-bungarotoxin from the Taiwanese banded krait. α-Bungarotoxin causes paralysis and death in prey by binding (with near irreversibility) to the neuromuscular junction nAChR (for a review, see Ref. 10Chiappinelli V.A. Harvey A. Natural and Synthetic Neurotoxins. Academic Press, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, London1993: 65-109Google Scholar). α-Conotoxins are small disulfide-rich peptides that have been isolated from Conus. Conus is a large genus of predatory marine snails, some of which feed on fish. A major component of the complex venomous arsenal that the fish-eating Conusemploy are toxins that act at the muscle nicotinic receptor subtype. Examples include the α-, αA- and ψ-conotoxins (11McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the cloning and synthesis of a novel α-conotoxin from the fish-eating cone snail Conus geographus. In contrast to previously isolated α-conotoxins from this species, the new α-conotoxin has no detectable activity at the muscle subtype of receptor, but instead, it potently targets neuronal nAChRs. DNA from C. geographushepatopancreas was isolated using the Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Frozen tissue was placed in 600 μl of lysis buffer, homogenized with a disposable microcentrifuge pestle, and digested overnight with 60 μg of proteinase K at 55 °C. The remainder of the procedure followed the kit manufacturer’s suggested protocol for marine invertebrates. The resulting genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR using oligonucleotides, tailed for cloning, corresponding to the 3′-end of the intron preceding the toxin region of α-conotoxin prepropeptides and the 3′-UTR (untranslated region) sequence of the α prepropeptides (12Schoenfeld R.A. The Genomic Structure of Delta-contoxins and other O-superfamily Conotoxins.Ph.D. thesis. University of Utah, 1999Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was purified using the High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. The eluted DNA fragment was annealed to pAMP1 vector, and the resulting product was used to transfect competent DH5α cells with the CloneAmp pAMP system for rapid cloning of amplification products (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s suggested protocols. The nucleic acid sequences of the resulting clones were determined according to the standard protocol for the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit as described previously (13Jimenez E.C. Craig A.G. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Gulyas J. Rivier J.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Peptide was synthesized, 0.45 mmol/g, on a Fmoc amide resin (Applied Biosystems, catalog No. 401435) using Fmoc chemistry and standard side chain protection except on cysteine residues. Cys residues were protected in pairs with eitherS-trityl on Cys2 and Cys8 orS-acetamidomethyl on Cys3 and Cys16. Amino acid derivatives were from Bachem (Torrance, CA). The peptides were removed from the resin and precipitated; a two-step oxidation protocol was used to selectively fold the peptides as described previously (14Walker C. Steel D. Jacobsen R.B. Lirazan M.B. Cruz L.J. Hooper D. Shetty R. DelaCruz R.C. Nielsen J.S. Zhou L. Bandyopadhyay P. Craig A. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30664-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first disulfide bridge was closed by dripping the peptide into an equal volume of 20 mmpotassium ferricyanide, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5. The solution was allowed to react for 30 min, and the monocyclic peptide was purified by reverse phase HPLC. Simultaneous removal of theS-acetamidomethyl groups and closure of the second disulfide bridge was carried out by iodine oxidation. The monocyclic peptide and HPLC eluent was dripped into an equal volume of iodine (10 mm) in H2O:trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile (78:2:20 by volume) and allowed to react for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ascorbic acid diluted 20-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the bicyclic was purified by HPLC. Clones of human nAChR subunits were used to produce cRNA for injection into Xenopus oocytes as described previously (15McIntosh J.M. Gardner S. Luo S. Garrett J.E. Yoshikami D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 393: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A 30-μl cylindrical oocyte recording chamber fabricated from Sylgard was gravity-perfused with ND96A (96.0 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1 μm atropine, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.1–7.5) at a rate of ∼2/min (16Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All toxin solutions also contained 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to reduce nonspecific adsorption of peptide. The perfusion medium could be switched to one containing peptide or ACh by utilizing a series of three-way solenoid valves. ACh-gated currents were obtained with a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (model OC-725B, Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT) and data captured as previously described (16Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane potential of the oocytes was clamped at −70 mV. To apply a pulse of ACh to the oocytes, the perfusion fluid was switched to one containing ACh for 1 s. This was done automatically at intervals of 1–5 min. The shortest time interval was chosen such that reproducible control responses were obtained with no observable desensitization. The concentration of ACh was 10 μm for trials with α1β1δε and 50 μmfor all other nAChRs. For responses in toxin (test responses), the perfusion solution was switched to ND96A and toxin. Toxin was perfused until the maximum block was obtained. Thereafter, toxin was washed away and ACh pulses were given. All ACh pulses contain no toxin, for it was assumed that little if any bound toxin washed away in the brief time (<2 s for the responses to peak). The average peak amplitude of three control responses just preceding the exposure to toxin was used to normalize the amplitude of each test response to obtain a “% response” or “% block.” Each data point of a dose-response curve represents the average value ± S.E. of measurements from at least three oocytes. Dose-response curves were fit to the equation %response=100/{1+([toxin]/IC50)nH}Equation 1 where nH is the Hill coefficient, using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego) on an Apple Power Macintosh. Goldfish (4–5 cm) were injected intramuscularly with 5 μl of 150 mm NaCl with or without toxin using a Hamilton syringe. Fish were observed for paralysis by placing them in a 500-ml beaker of water and stirring the water with a glass rod at ∼120 revolutions/min. Unaffected fish were able to maintain their position in the beaker by swimming against the current. As fish became progressively paralyzed, they increasingly drifted with the current. Young Swiss-Webster mice (∼12 g) were injected intraperitoneally with 50 μl of 150 mm NaCl with and without toxin. Mice were observed for symptoms of paralysis, and death time was determined by monitoring heartbeat with a stethoscope. Mature α-conotoxins are derived from proteolytic processing of larger precursor proteins. In the case of the α-conotoxins, this prepropeptide is ∼60 amino acids, with the mature α-conotoxin sequence of 13–18 amino acids located at the C terminus of the precursor. The processing site usually consists of one or a pair of basic amino acids that immediately precedes the mature toxin in the precursor sequence (12Schoenfeld R.A. The Genomic Structure of Delta-contoxins and other O-superfamily Conotoxins.Ph.D. thesis. University of Utah, 1999Google Scholar). We exploited the conserved features of the α-conotoxin gene structure to isolate a novel α-conotoxin gene. PCR primers were designed to directly amplify the α-conotoxin gene sequence from genomic DNA. PCR amplification of genomic DNA fromC. geographus yielded a single specific α-conopeptide gene product, which was cloned and sequenced. Three identical clones representing the α-conotoxin GIC sequence were identified. A clone of α-conotoxin MII from Conus magus is shown for comparison (see Fig. 1). Note that the prepropeptide regions of the two peptides are highly conserved, in contrast to the mature toxin regions where there is considerable divergence in the C-terminal portion of the peptides. Solid phase synthesis of the predicted mature toxin was undertaken. It was assumed that the disulfide bridging of α-conotoxin GIC was analogous to all previously characterized α-conotoxins, that is, Cys1–Cys3, Cys2–Cys4. Cys groups were orthogonally protected to direct disulfide formation in this configuration. Acid-labile protecting groups were removed from the first and third cysteines during the cleavage reaction that released linear peptide from the resin. Closure of the disulfide bridge was accomplished by use of FeCN. After purification of the monocyclic peptide by HPLC, the acid-stabile acetamidomethyl group were next removed from the second and fourth cysteines, and the disulfide bridge was closed by iodine oxidation. The bicyclic peptide was purified again by HPLC. Liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry of synthetic α-conotoxin GIC was consistent with the amidated sequence (monisotopic MH+: calculated, 1609.6; observed, 1609.5). Synthetic α-conotoxin GIC eluted considerably earlier from the reverse phase HPLC column compared with α-conotoxin MII, a peptide isolated from another fish-hunting cone (see Fig.2). The greater hydrophilicity of GIC seemed to have practical consequences for peptide handling. Although we did not fully investigate this phenomenon, it appeared that α-conotoxin GIC did not significantly stick to the electrophysiological recording chamber as does α-conotoxin MII. Therefore, bath applications of toxin in the recording chamber gave similar or identical results to perfusion-applied toxin. This is in contrast to the more hydrophobic α-conotoxin MII, in which bath application of toxin can lead to a 5–10-fold underestimation of potency (compared with perfusion application of toxin). C. geographus feeds on fish by first entrapping its prey with a distensible stomach and then harpooning and envenomating the fish. C. geographus produces both α-conotoxin GI and the newly isolated α-conotoxin GIC. α-Conotoxin GI is known to act selectively at the muscle subtype of receptor (17Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar). One nmol of GI injected intramuscularly into fish produced signs of paralysis in 60 s or less, with full paralysis by 3 min (n = 3). In contrast, 3.5 nmol of α-conotoxin GIC did not produce any signs of paralysis (n = 3). The effects of these toxins were also assessed in young Swiss-Webster mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 25-day-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 μl of solution containing either α-conotoxin GI or α-conotoxin GIC. Two nmol of α-conotoxin GI caused paralysis and death in less than 5 min (n = 2). In contrast, 5 nmol of α-conotoxin GIC did not produce any observable motor deficits or paralysis (n = 3). Results obtained from the bioassays indicated that α-conotoxin GIC had little if any activity on the neuromuscular nAChR. To examine this further, we heterologously expressed the human muscle subtype of nAChR (α1β1δε) inXenopus oocytes. Exposure to up to 100 μmtoxin produced no block of the ACh-induced current. In contrast, 10 nm toxin blocked 91.5 ± 2.4% of the ACh-induced response of human α3β2 nAChRs (n = 6) (see Fig. 3). Concentration-response analysis was conducted on α3β2 and other subunit combinations of nAChRs. The results are shown in Fig.4 and TableI. Thus, α-conotoxin GIC has >5 orders-of-magnitude selectivity for the α3β2 subunit combinationversus the muscle subtype. The pharmacological profile of α-conotoxin GIC is generally similar to that of α-conotoxin MII; both have high potency for the α3β2 subunit combination. However, the kinetics of block by these toxins are substantially different. As shown in Fig. 5, block by α-conotoxin GIC is reversed relatively rapidly (>50% recovery in 1 min) upon toxin washout. In contrast, block by α-conotoxin MII is only slowly reversed, with ∼50% recovery after 19 min.Table IIC50s of α-conotoxin GIC on nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytesnAChRIC50nmhα1β1δɛ>100,000hα3β21.1hα3β4755hα4β2309h, human.

After control responses were obtained, 100 nm α-conotoxin GIC was applied to human α3β2-expressing oocytes for 10 min. The oocyte was then continuously perfused with buffer without toxin while responses to ACh were obtained. Similar results were obtained in two other experiments. B, the same protocol was used for application of 100 nm α-conotoxin MII. The recovery from block was ∼20-fold slower than in the case of α-conotoxin GIC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) h, human. We have characterized a 16-amino acid conotoxin with four Cys residues. The homology of the encoding gene with other conotoxin genes reveals that the peptide belongs to the A-superfamily ofConus toxins. The A-superfamily comprises a variety of peptides, most of which act on nAChRs, although others act at potassium or sodium channels (18McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 294: 605-624Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The sequence and activity of the newly characterized toxin relegates it to the α-conotoxin family, members of which act on nAChRs. The total chemical synthesis of the new peptide, α-conotoxin GIC, was carried out using orthogonal protection of Cys residues to direct disulfide bond formation in the previously characterized pattern of α-conotoxins. We note that α-conotoxin GIC has not yet been isolated from venom. It is possible that there are post-translational modifications present in the native peptide that could influence the properties reported for the synthetic peptide described in this report. Previously isolated α-conotoxins from the fish-hunting speciesC. geographus (see Table II) have what is referred to in the literature as a 3/5 spacing, indicating that there are respectively three and five amino acids in between Cys residues in the two loops of the toxin. The newly characterized toxin has a 4/7 spacing. The α3/5 toxins, isolated based on their ability to cause paralysis in mice, previously have been shown to potently inhibit the muscle nicotinic receptor subtype. Likewise, the major α3/5 conotoxin from C. geographus, α-conotoxin GI, is a potent paralytic in fish. In contrast, α-conotoxin GIC fails to produce paralysis in either mouse or fish. Electrophysiological testing of α-conotoxin GIC on the human muscle subtype of receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes is consistent with lack of paralytic activity. Little or no block of ACh-induced current was produced at concentrations up to 100 μm toxin.Table IIα-Conotoxinsα-ConotoxinSpeciesSequencenAChR targetGICC. geographusGCCSHPACAGNNQHIC#NeuronalMIIC. magusGCCSNPVCHLEHSNLC#NeuronalGIC. geographusECCNPACGRHYSC#MuscleGIAC. geographusECCNPACGRHYSCGK#MuscleGIBC. geographusECCNPACGRHYSCKG#MuscleMIC. magusGRCCHPACGKNYSC#MuscleMIAC. magusDGRCCHPACAKHFNC#MuscleMIBC. magusNGRCCHPACARKYNC#Muscle#, C-terminal amidation. Open table in a new tab #, C-terminal amidation. On the other hand, α-conotoxin GIC potently blocks the α3β2 subunit combination of receptor with an IC50 of ∼1 nm (Fig. 3 and Table I). It also has a modest amount of activity at α3β4 and α4β2 receptor subtypes. With respect to its pharmacological profile of activity, α-conotoxin GIC is similar to α-conotoxin MII, which also has high affinity for α3β2 receptors, and is structurally similar in that both have an α4/7 spacing. The two α-conotoxins differ in a number of respects, however. Although α-conotoxins MII and GIC share six of the eight N-terminal amino acids, they differ in seven of the eight C-terminal amino acids (Table II). α-Conotoxin GIC is much more hydrophilic than α-conotoxin MII (Fig. 2). Particularly striking is the difference in the kinetics of block between the two toxins. We previously demonstrated that block of rat α3β2 receptors by α-conotoxin MII is only slowly reversible (t12∼7.7 min; (19Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the off-time of α-conotoxin MII is even slower at human α3β2 receptors (t12 ∼19 min). In contrast, block by α-conotoxin GIC is much more rapidly reversed (∼20-fold faster; Fig. 5), making α-conotoxin GIC a potentially useful ligand for electrophysiological experiments, in which high potency and rapid reversibility are desired characteristics. α-Conotoxin GIC has the highest known selectivity for neuronal (e.g. the α3β2 subtype) versus muscle subtype of any nicotinic ligand characterized thus far. Although α-conotoxin MII itself is already quite selective (>1,000-fold selectivityversus the muscle subtype), α-conotoxin GIC has >100,000-fold selectivity for α3β2 versus the muscle receptor. Why does C. geographus, a mollusc that depends on paralyzing its prey, produce a nonparalytic toxin targeted to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors? The present findings do not answer this question, but it is worth noting compounds with similar pharmacological specificity reported from other venomous organisms. Although the major component in Bungarus multicinctus venom is α-bungarotoxin, this snake also produces a minor component known as κ-bungarotoxin, which potently blocks α3β2 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (IC50 ∼1 nm). The mechanism of action is consistent with competitive blockade (20Harvey S.C. Luetje C.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3798-3806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Luetje C.W. Maddox F.N. Harvey S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1112-1119PubMed Google Scholar). Additional subtypes of nicotinic receptors are also blocked by κ-bungarotoxin, including the muscle subtype. The kinetics of block, however, are significantly different, and an α3β2-like receptor seems to be the primary target (20Harvey S.C. Luetje C.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3798-3806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Papke R.L. Duvoisin R.M. Heinemann S.F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1993; 252: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C. magus produces peptides that are highly selective for the muscle subtype of nicotinic receptor and that are relatively inactive on the α3β2 nAChRs (e.g. α-conotoxin MI) (17Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar,23McIntosh J.M. Cruz L.J. Hunkapiller M.W. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, C. magus also produces α-conotoxin MII, which has only very weak activity at the muscle subtype (19Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We establish in this report that C. geographus produces, in addition to its muscle-targeted toxins, α-conotoxin GIC, which has potent neuronal activity and a striking lack of activity on the muscle receptor. Perhaps it is not coincidental that these polypeptides, κ-bungarotoxin, α-conotoxin MII, and α-conotoxin GIC, have weak or no activity on the muscle receptor, and yet each has high affinity for α3β2-like receptors. It seems striking that two very distinct predatory venomous organisms (snakes and snails) appear to have independently evolved not only toxins that target neuromuscular nAChRs but also those that specifically target α3β2-like receptors. The biological utility of the latter type of toxins is unknown; however, α3β2-like receptors exist in autonomic ganglia, where they in part modulate the fight-or-flight response (24Tavazoie S.F. Tavazoie M.F. McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the function of the toxins that target α3β2-like receptors is to suppress this response rather than to block neuromuscular activity.

When light intensity exceeds the capacity for electron transport from water to NADP+, excess energy can be diverted to molecular oxygen with the formation of reactive species harmful for the chloroplast, thus leading to photoinhibition of photosystems (5Kok B. Gassner E.B. Rurainski H.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1966; 4: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In these conditions photoprotection mechanisms are activated leading to the thermal dissipation of excess chlorophyll singlet states (6Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

At the same time, the pigment composition of thylakoid membranes is modified by the operation of the xanthophyll cycle, consisting of the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin by the lumenal enzyme VDE, which binds to thylakoids upon activation by low lumenal pH. During operation of the xanthophyll cycle, violaxanthin bound to a low affinity site of LHCII (7Caffarri S. Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. J. Biol.

Moreover, zeaxanthin can be exchanged for violaxanthin in high affinity binding sites of Lhc proteins where it induces a conformational change leading to increased thermal dissipation (1Moya I.

Knowledge of the xanthophyll exchange in different Lhc proteins is limited, and the understanding of the mechanisms is very low. In this study we analyzed the extent of the xanthophyll exchange in the different Lhc proteins in vivoupon activation of the xanthophyll cycle by strong illumination. We compared these results with those obtained in vitro by using a reconstituted system composed of recombinant Lhc proteins and the recombinant VDE enzyme. The extent of zeaxanthin binding to Lhc proteins strongly differed among members of the Lhc protein family. The results obtained by the simple in vitro system closely reproduce those obtained in vivo, thus suggesting that differences in protein structure are the major determinants for the regulation of xanthophyll exchange. Biochemical and spectroscopic analysis of Lhc proteins upon in vitro de-epoxidation showed that xanthophyll exchange occurs specifically at the L2-binding site. This site was previously shown (10Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to act as an allosteric regulator of thermal dissipation activity in Lhc proteins by controlling the transition between two conformations of Lhc proteins (1Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the xanthophyll cycle is part of a signal transduction system acting in the modulation of light harvesting versusthermal dissipation in the photosystems of higher plants. Z. mays (cv. Dekalb DK300) plants were grown for 2 weeks at 23 °C at low light intensities (∼80 μE, 14 h light/10 h dark). One set of plants was light-stressed at ∼1000 μE m−2 s−1for 30 min at 20 °C, whereas control plants were maintained at growth conditions. After treatment leaves were rapidly harvested, cooled in ice, and chloroplast membranes were isolated as previously reported (11Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thylakoids were solubilized with 1% DM and fractionated by flatbed preparative isoelectric focusing as previously described (12Dainese P. Hoyer-hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions from IEF were further fractionated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation to eliminate co-migrating pigments. Free pigment formed a yellow band in the upper part of the gradient, whereas Lhc proteins formed multiple green bands migrating at higher sucrose densities. The green fractions from each tube were pooled for further analysis. The pigment content was determined by HPLC (13Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and fitting of the acetone extract with the spectra of the individual pigments (14Connelly J.P. Müller M.G. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed with the Tris-Tricine buffer system as previously reported (15Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The construct QAV expressing VDE was a kind gift of Prof. Yamamoto (16Hieber A.D. Bugos R.C. Verhoeven A.S. Yamamoto H.Y. Planta. 2002; 214: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the VDE expression,Escherichia coli cultures (SG13009 strain) (17Gottesman S. Halpern E. Trisler P. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a 600-nm absorbance of 0.6 were induced with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h and purified on a Ni2+ affinity column. The protein was denatured in 6 m guanidine-HCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 0.2 m NaCl and then refolded with a slow dilution of the denaturant with the renaturation buffer (10% glycerol, 0.25%n- octyl-β-d-glucoside, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) (16Hieber A.D. Bugos R.C. Verhoeven A.S. Yamamoto H.Y. Planta. 2002; 214: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Lhc were expressed and isolated from E. colifollowing a protocol as previously described (11Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 18Paulsen H. Hobe S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Lhca1 and Lhca4 from Arabidopsis thaliana, Lhcb4 (CP29) and Lhcb5 (CP26) from Z. mays, and Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3 from Hordeum vulgare were reconstituted as described (19Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The reconstitution mixture contained 420 μg of Lhc apoprotein and 240 μg of chlorophyll a plus b. The Chla/b ratio in the pigment mixture varied from 2.3 to 4.5 as optimized for the different Lhc proteins: Lhcb1–3, 2.3; CP26, 3.0; CP29, 4.5; and Lhca1/4, 4.0. Xanthophyll content was 90 μg of violaxanthin for Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3 and 60 μg for CP26, CP29, and Lhca1, 4. The absorption spectra at room temperature were recorded by a SLM-Aminco DK2000 spectrophotometer and a 0.4-nm step was used. The CD spectra were measured at 10 °C on a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter. Samples were in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, and 0.06% β-DM. Absorption spectra were analyzed in terms of the contribution of individual pigments by using the absorption spectra of pigments in Lhc proteins as previously reported (20Croce R. Cinque G. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Lhc proteins (3 μg of chlorophyll) were mixed with 60 μg/ml monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) and added to the reaction mixture containing 250 mmcitrate buffer, pH 5.1, and 0.02% β-DM and 1.5 × 10−3 units of the VDE enzyme preparation. The de-epoxidation was performed at 28 °C for 30′ and started by adding 30 mm of ascorbate as described in Ref. 21Jahns P. Wehner A. Paulsen H. Hobe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22154-22159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 250 μl of Tris-HCl 3m, pH 8.45. Following the reaction, proteins were concentrated in Centricon tubes (10 kDa cut-off) and purified from free pigments by ultracentrifugation in 15–40% glycerol gradient containing 0.06% β-DM and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. Maize plants were exposed to high light intensity to induce de-epoxidation. Thylakoids from light stressed plants were isolated and fractionated into different Lhc complexes by preparative IEF (12Dainese P. Hoyer-hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1shows the polypeptide composition of the different fractions as determined by SDS-PAGE. We obtained 12 different fractions ranging from a pI of 3.9–6.5. Although IEF did not allow purification of individual pigment-binding proteins, the distribution of each Lhc polypeptide among different fractions was determined by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. The reactions obtained with α-CP24, α-CP26, α-CP29, α-LHCI, and α-LHCII antibodies are also indicated in Fig.1. The pigment composition of individual fractions was determined by HPLC analysis upon separation of free pigments from pigment-protein complexes by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (12Dainese P. Hoyer-hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The violaxanthin and zeaxanthin levels in each fraction are shown in Fig.2.Figure 2Violaxanthin and zeaxanthin content of fractions from IEF separation. Violaxanthin (empty bars) and zeaxanthin (filled bars) content in different fractions is expressed in mol/100 mol of Chl a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fractions 1–4 contain only LHCII and have a low level of zeaxanthin (0.4–0.6 mol/100 mol of Chl a). It is interesting to observe that fractions enriched in Lhcb3 (fraction 1) have the highest level of zeaxanthin. These data suggest that Lhcb3 can bind zeaxanthin more efficiently than other LHCII components, although to a low level. The fractions with the highest zeaxanthin content (0.9–1.3 mol/100 mol Chl a) were those with pI ranging from 4.2 to 4.5 and numbered from 5 to 7. These fractions contained LHCII, CP26, and CP24. Because fractions 1–4 contained only LHCII and showed a very low zeaxanthin content, we conclude that zeaxanthin is mostly bound to CP26 and CP24. Their enhanced zeaxanthin level is even more significant if we consider that LHCII is the most abundant component in these fractions. In fact, densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE showed that CP26 and CP24 content in these fractions is in the range of 5–10% of the total protein. Fraction 8 did not contain any polypeptide, and even immunoblotting with α-Lhc proteins could not detect any specific reaction, suggesting no Lhc proteins were present in this fraction. CP29 in its phosphorylated form is the only protein present in fraction 9 (22Bergantino E. Dainese P. Cerovic Z. Sechi S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11142-11148Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Zeaxanthin is present in this fraction at the level of 0.45 mol/100 mol of Chl a, similar to fractions 1–4 containing LHCII. The remaining fractions (10Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 12Dainese P. Hoyer-hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contained CP29 in its non-phosphorylated form and the PSI-LHCI complex. The level of zeaxanthin in these fractions was low (0.2 mol/100 mol of Chla). To obtain a better estimation of the zeaxanthin content of LHCI, we have purified the PSI-LHCI complex from CP29 by sucrose gradient. The zeaxanthin content of this preparation was 0.2 mol/100 mol of Chla. Due to the presence of LHCI together with PSI core (see Fig. 1), which binds high amounts of Chl a, the actual content of zeaxanthin in LHCI proteins is probably underestimated. Although the determination of the zeaxanthin content of individual Lhc proteins upon de-epoxidation in vivo is physiologically relevant, little information can be obtained on the biochemical factors controlling xanthophyll exchange. In fact, zeaxanthin is exchanged for violaxanthin, whose content in individual Lhc proteins ranges from 0.2 mol/polypeptide in Lhcb1 to 1.2 mol/polypeptide in Lhca1. Moreover, the accessibility of zeaxanthin-binding sites to newly formed zeaxanthin can be different depending on the aggregation state of individual Lhc proteins in the thylakoid supramolecular assemblies. To determine the intrinsic capacity of individual Lhc proteins to exchange violaxanthin for zeaxanthin, we have used a simplified reconstituted system (21Jahns P. Wehner A. Paulsen H. Hobe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22154-22159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in which de-epoxidation is performed in vitro using a recombinant VDE enzyme (16Hieber A.D. Bugos R.C. Verhoeven A.S. Yamamoto H.Y. Planta. 2002; 214: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. As substrate we used recombinant Lhc proteins reconstituted in vitro from the apoprotein expressed in bacteria and purified pigments. To overcome the problem of a different content of violaxanthin and evaluate their specific exchange capacity, we have reconstituted the different Lhc proteins with violaxanthin as the only xanthophyll (24Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 25Frank H.A. Das S.K. Bautista J.A. Bruce D. Vasil'ev S. Crimi M. Croce R.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), thus obtaining recombinant proteins with a comparable xanthophyll composition. Violaxanthin de-epoxidase from A. thaliana (16Hieber A.D. Bugos R.C. Verhoeven A.S. Yamamoto H.Y. Planta. 2002; 214: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. To increase the specific activity, this preparation was subjected to a denaturation/renaturation cycle by first treating with 6 mguanidine-HCl and, upon binding to a Ni2+ column, slowly diluting the guanidine-HCl with renaturation buffer. VDE obtained by this procedure showed 12 times higher activity (350 nmol of violaxanthin de-epoxidized min−1 mg protein−1) with respect to the protein purified in the native state, suggesting that an inefficient folding had occurred in the bacterial host. Seven different Lhc polypeptides were expressed inE. coli and reconstituted with violaxanthin as the only carotenoid: Lhcb1, Lhcb2, Lhcb3, Lhcb4 (CP29), Lhcb5 (CP26), Lhca1, and Lhca4. The pigment complement of different polypeptides, as obtained by HPLC and fitting of acetone extracts, is summarized in TableI. The xanthophyll content of different Lhc proteins ranged between 2 and 3 per polypeptide. The lower value was obtained in the case of CP29 (1.9 mol/mol of polypeptide), whereas Lhca1 yielded a value near 3 (2.8 mol/polypeptide). Lhcb3 protein bound ∼2.4 violaxanthin/polypeptide. This latter value is clearly different from previous results obtained with Lhcb1 from Z. maysshowing a value of 2.0 (24Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The reason for this difference must be ascribed to the different gene product and strongly suggests that the affinity of individual binding sites for different xanthophyll species can vary between individual Lhcb gene products.Table IPigment composition of Lhc complexes reconstituted with violaxanthinLhcb1Lhcb2Lhcb3CP26CP29Lhca1Lhca4Chl a/Chlb1.51.41.92.32.94.22.6Chl a7.17.07.26.25.98.17.2Chl b4.95.03.82.82.11.92.8Violaxanthin2.52.12.72.21.92.82.2Chl tot121211981010Pigment composition of Lhcb1, Lhcb2, Lhcb3, CP26, CP29, Lhca1, and Lhca4 reconstituted in vitro with violaxanthin as the unique carotenoid.

We then analyzed recombinant proteins reconstituted with violaxanthin as the only xanthophyll to assess whether the modification in xanthophyll composition did actually modify Lhc protein conformation. To this aim we compared the absorption and CD spectra of Lhc proteins reconstituted with the whole set of xanthophylls to those of the same complexes reconstituted with violaxanthin only. Differences were detected in the Soret range due to the direct absorption of xanthophylls; however, in the Qy range the absorption and CD spectra of Lhc proteins with violaxanthin only were essentially identical to those of the corresponding control Lhc protein (see CP26 and Lhca1, Fig. 3,A–D). The Qy absorption and CD spectra are an excellent probe of protein conformation because Chl absorption is modulated by each binding site to distinct energy levels and responds to conformational changes (23Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11142-11148Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The observation that only very minor changes could be detected in this spectral region clearly shows that Lhc proteins reconstituted with violaxanthin only are representative of their control forms also binding lutein and neoxanthin. This is consistent with previous work with Lhcb1 and CP26 (24Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 25Frank H.A. Das S.K. Bautista J.A. Bruce D. Vasil'ev S. Crimi M. Croce R. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A reconstituted in vitrosystem for Lhc xanthophyll de-epoxidation was accomplished by mixing recombinant Lhc proteins with recombinant VDE plus MGDG and ascorbate, previously shown to be essential for VDE activity (28Yamamoto H.Y. Higashi R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments were run at different temperatures and pH values by using the activity assay previously reported (29Yamamoto H.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 303-312Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with purified violaxanthin as a substrate rather than Lhc proteins. The de-epoxidation activity was strongly dependent on temperature with a 5-fold increase between 20 and 28 °C and also a sharp pH optimum at 5.2. The assay conditions were therefore set at 28 °C and pH 5.2 for 30 min when using Lhc-bound violaxanthin as a substrate with 60 μg/ml MGDG and 30 mm ascorbate as co-factors. These assay conditions were successful for all Lhc proteins eccept CP24, which was denatured by prolonged incubation at 28 °C, consistent with a previous report (30Pagano A. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17154-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) of low stability of this pigment-protein complex both recombinant or purified from thylakoids. Following incubation, Lhc complexes were re-purified by a glycerol gradient to separate pigments freed during the incubation from pigment-protein complexes. The pigment content of the two fractions was analyzed by HPLC and fitted to acetone extracts. In all cases, the free pigment fractions, obtained as a yellow-green band on the upper region of the gradient, showed the highest level of de-epoxidated xanthophylls, in particular antheraxanthin, implying the favored substrate for de-epoxidation was the freed xanthophyll in MGDG rather than the protein-bound form. Only traces of antheraxanthin were found to be protein-bound, suggesting that the affinity of the protein-binding sites was higher for either violaxanthin or zeaxanthin than antheraxanthin. The results in Fig. 3 show that all proteins are able to exchange violaxanthin with zeaxanthin, although the amplitude of the effect was very different depending on the gene product. Among Lhc complexes, CP26 showed the highest level of zeaxanthin after 30′ of de-epoxidation (7.7 mol/100 mol of Chl a) as compared with the rest of the Lhcb proteins. In fact, CP29, Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3 had reduced levels of zeaxanthin after incubation under the same conditions (0.8–2.2 mol zeaxanthin/100 mol of Chl a). Longer periods of incubation led to a decrease in differences between the individual Lhc proteins when the reaction approached saturation (90′-120′). An interesting result was obtained with Lhca1 and Lhca4 proteins, which showed a violaxanthin-to-zeaxanthin exchange efficiency comparable with CP26 (4.1 and 6.0 mol zeaxanthin/100 mol of Chla, respectively). The control samples were incubated in the same conditions but without the enzyme. In Fig. 4 we show the CP26 results because it was the most efficient protein in violaxanthin exchange. After 30′ incubation at 28 °C, pH 5.2, without VDE, the complex was purified by gradient ultracentrifugation. Even in the absence of the enzyme, the content in violaxanthin was reduced, although to a lower extent with respect to the sample incubated with VDE (6.3 mol/100 mol of Chl a versus 8.7 mol/100 mol of Chl a). If zeaxanthin was added in excess (1 μg/ml) to the mixture at the beginning of the incubation, the total xanthophyll content did not decrease; however, part of the violaxanthin was substituted by zeaxanthin. These data indicate that xanthophyll exchange at low pH does not depend on the presence of the VDE enzyme but only on the xanthophylls present in the reaction mixture. Similar results were obtained with Lhca4. In this case when zeaxanthin was supplied in the reaction mixture in the absence of VDE enzyme, it was bound by the protein to a level of 18 mol/100 mol of Chla. In a second experiment, Lhca4 was incubated with an excess of zeaxanthin at neutral pH (7.5). In this case, the exchange level was ∼3 times lower than at pH 5.2 (5.5 versus 18 mol of zeaxanthin bound/100 mol of Chl a). Consistently, the level of violaxanthin that remained bound to the Lhca4 protein after incubation with zeaxanthin was 16 and 27 mol/100 mol of Chla, at pH 5.2 and pH 7.5, respectively. A further observation on the effect of the incubation of Lhc proteins was that the Chl a/b ratio decreased upon incubation in the reaction medium (TableII). Either a loss of chlorophylla or the gain of chlorophyll b can explain this effect. The latter hypothesis seems unlikely in this in vitro system in which excess Chl b is not available, and the alternative hypothesis of a loss of Chl a is also supported by an increase of the Chl a/b ratio in the free pigment fraction after the de-epoxidation (not shown). Because the Chl a/b ratio did not change upon incubation at pH 7.5, we suggest that the low pH treatment was necessary not only for xanthophyll exchange but also for the loss of Chl a. When normalized to the Chl-to-protein stoichiometry of the individual Lhc proteins, the amplitude of Chl a release corresponded to one mol/mol of polypepti"

To study whether ER activity is altered by orphan nuclear receptors that mediate the cellular response to xenobiotics, cross-talk between ER and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), steroid and xenobiotic receptor, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ was examined in HepG2 cells. Of these receptors, CAR substantially inhibited ER-mediated transcriptional activity of the vitellogenin B1 promoter as well as a synthetic estrogen responsive element (ERE)-containing promoter. Treatment with an agonist of CAR, 1,4-bis-(2-(3,5-dichloropyridoxyl))benzene, potentiated CAR-mediated transcriptional repression. In contrast, an antagonist of CAR, androstenol, alleviated the repression effect. Although CAR interacted with the ER in solution, CAR did not interact with the ER bound to the ERE. CAR/retinoid X receptor bound to the ERE but with much lower affinity than ER. Incremental amounts of CAR elicited a progressive reduction of the ER activity induced by the p160 coactivator glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1). In turn, increasing amounts of GRIP-1 progressively reversed the depression of ER activity by CAR. An agonist or antagonist of CAR potentiated or alleviated, respectively, the CAR-mediated repression of the GRIP-1-enhanced ER activity, which is consistent with the ability of theses ligands to increase or decrease, respectively, the interaction of CAR with GRIP-1. A CAR mutant that did not interact with GRIP-1 did not inhibit ER-mediated transactivation. Our data demonstrate that xenobiotic nuclear receptor CAR antagonizes ER-mediated transcriptional activity by squelching limiting amounts of p160 coactivator and imply that xenobiotics may influence ER function of female reproductive physiology, cell differentiation, tumorigenesis, and lipid metabolism."

Gilchrist A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This family of proteins can be divided into four groups, Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12, based on sequence homology of their α subunits. The G12 proteins, Gα12 and Gα13, are ubiquitously expressed and share 67% amino acid sequence identity (2Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Both G12and G13 can couple to the same receptors, bind to the same RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) proteins, regulate the same downstream pathways, and produce the same effects such as cytoskeletal rearrangements, oncogenic transformation, and apoptosis (2Dhanasekaran N.

However, despite these appearances, the cellular and physiologic functions of Gα12 and Gα13 do not completely overlap. They act through different pathways to regulate Na+/H+ exchange (9Dhanasekaran N. Vara Prasad M.V.V.S. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. van Rossum G. J. Biol.

Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The most striking difference is that Gα13-deficient mice die at midgestation with defects in angiogenesis (16Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), whereas Gα12-deficient mice are alive and without an obvious phenotype (17Offermanns S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A recent report shows that Gα12 interacts with Hsp90 (heat shock protein of 90 kDa), and this interaction is required for Gα12 signaling (18Vaiskunaite R. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46088-46093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Hsp90 interaction was specific for Gα12 because Gα13 did not bind or show functional interactions with Hsp90. Hsp90 is an abundant and ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperone with the unique property of binding and maintaining the activity of numerous signal transduction proteins (19Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 20Richter K. Buchner J. J. Cell.

Lau A. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32642-32647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently Hsp90 was discovered to serve as a scaffold to promote the interactions of the Akt kinase and its substrate, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, through their binding to two of the multiple protein binding sites on Hsp90 (22Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Compartmentalization of eukaryotic cell membranes into dynamic microdomains, referred to as lipid rafts, has been detected in numerous studies using different methodologies (23Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 24Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

These microdomains are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and can be isolated by their resistance to cold, nonionic detergent extraction. Proteins modified with multiple acyl chains or glycosylphosphatidylinositol groups are targeted to lipid rafts (23Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 26Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The Gα subunits of the Gs, Gi, and Gq classes undergo palmitoylation and/or myristoylation on their amino-terminal ends (27Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and localize to lipid rafts (28Miura Y. Hanada K. Jones T.L.Z.

Gα12 and Gα13 also undergo palmitoylation, the reversible addition of palmitate to cysteine residues through a thioester bond (32Jones T.L.Z. Gutkind J.S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3196-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Ponimaskin E. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and two or three cysteine residues (Cys-14, Cys-18, and Cys-37) for Gα13 are critical for this posttranslational modification (34Ponimaskin E. Behn H. Adarichev V. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Offermanns S. Schmidt M.F.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Bhattacharyya R. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol.

We investigated the lipid raft localization of Gα12 and Gα13 to better understand the different signaling functions of these proteins. We found a distinct segregation of Gα12 and Gα13 at the membrane. Gα13 was not in lipid rafts, whereas Gα12was in lipid rafts with both acylation and Hsp90 interactions critical for this targeting. The QE antibody specific for Gα12, HD antibody specific for Gα13, AS antibody specific for Gαi, and SW antibody specific for Gβ were prepared by immunizing rabbits with the carboxyl-terminal peptide sequence of the respective subunits and affinity-purified. Antibodies against the following proteins were purchased: Gα12 and Gα13 against their amino-terminal sequences and Fyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caveolin and Hsp90 (BD PharMingen), and Na+/K+-ATPase (Biomol Research Laboratories). OptiPrep was purchased from Invitrogen. Geldanamycin was obtained from Tocris Cookson Inc. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, was from Calbiochem. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin, hydrocortisone, and epidermal growth factor were from Sigma. Simian kidney (COS-7) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells that were transformed with SV-40 (HMEC1) (Biological Products Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) were maintained in MCBD 131 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (0.01 mg/ml). NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts that were stably transfected with wild-type and mutant plasmids of Gα12 were prepared and maintained as described previously (32Jones T.L.Z. Gutkind J.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3196-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In geldanamycin experiments, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h and preincubated with 10 μm MG132 for 10 min, and then 1 μg/ml geldanamycin was added and incubated for 1 h. In cholesterol depletion experiments, COS cells were preincubated with serum-free medium for 2 h and then treated with 20 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 30 min. DRMs were prepared as described previously with some modifications (36Lindwasser O.W. Resh M.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7913-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice and harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and the protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad). An aliquot of the cell suspension corresponding to 1 mg of protein was centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of TNET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors, incubated on ice for 20 min, and then homogenized with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysate was adjusted to 35% OptiPrep and overlaid with 3.0 ml of 30% OptiPrep in TNET and then with 200 μl of 5% OptiPrep in TNET in Beckman SW55 tubes. Samples were centrifuged for 4 h at 170,000 ×g at 4 °C and fractionated from the top (0.52 ml each for a total of nine fractions). The pellet was suspended in 0.52 ml of TNET buffer. SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol was added to aliquots of each fraction of the gradient. NIH 3T3 cells expressing the wild-type Gα12 or COS cells were homogenized in TNE buffer (TNET without Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors by passing through a 25-gauge needle 12 times. The particulate and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 125,000 ×g for 1 h. Aliquots of soluble and particulate fractions were treated with 200 μm MG132 for 10 min and then treated with 20 μg/ml of geldanamycin for 1 h. Triton X-100 was added to give a final concentration of 0.5% and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, then diluted 3-fold in TNE buffer, and further incubated for 4 h. Detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g and analyzed by immunoblotting. Equal volumes of gradient fractions were loaded on 12% polyacrylamide gels (Novex precast gels, Invitrogen) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) for detection of the antibodies per the manufacturer’s directions. Densitometry was performed using a UMAX scanner (model UTA-II) and Scion Image software. To determine whether Gα12 and Gα13 reside in lipid rafts, we prepared DRMs by treatment of COS cells with 0.5% Triton X-100 and centrifugation on an OptiPrep gradient. Caveolin, Fyn, and Gαi were found in fractions 1 and 2 consistent with their known partitioning to DRMs and lipid rafts (Fig. 1A) (25Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar). Na+/K+-ATPase, an integral plasma membrane protein not found in lipid rafts (36Lindwasser O.W. Resh M.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7913-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), was in the higher density fractions 6–8. Endogenous Gα12 was found in the DRM fraction 1; Gα13 was in the higher density fractions 7–9. We found the same pattern of partitioning after detergent solubilization and gradient centrifugation for the endogenous Gα12 and Gα13 proteins in two other cell lines, HMEC (Fig. 1B) and HEK293 (data not shown). In these cells, Gα12 and the lipid raft markers were in the DRM fractions, and Gα13 and Na+/K+-ATPase were in the higher density fractions. The partitioning of Gα12 and the lipid raft-associated proteins to the DRM fraction was abolished and decreased, respectively, by treatment with 20 mmmethyl-β-cyclodextrin, which depletes cellular cholesterol and disrupts lipid rafts (Fig. 1C). These results show that Gα12 segregates with proteins that prefer lipid rafts and Gα13 segregates with a plasma membrane protein that avoids lipid rafts. We investigated the role of the cysteine site of palmitoylation for targeting Gα12 to lipid rafts. Mutation of Cys-11 on Gα12 prevents [3H]palmitate incorporation, but the protein is still found in the particulate fraction (32Jones T.L.Z. Gutkind J.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3196-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both the wild-type Gα12 and a GTPase-deficient mutant of Gα12(Q229L) were in the DRM fractions in transfected NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.2A). Most of the nonpalmitoylated C11S mutant of Gα12 was shifted to the higher density fractions (Fig. 2A). This result is consistent with other studies showing that acylation can target proteins to lipid rafts (23Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar,26Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Further mutation of the amino terminus of Gα12 at Ser-2 and Arg-6 changes the acylation to myristoylation (32Jones T.L.Z. Gutkind J.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3196-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and restored a small amount of the DRM localization of Gα12(Fig. 2A). Therefore, the less hydrophobic myristate on the amino terminus could partially substitute for palmitate in targeting Gα12 to the DRM fractions. Given the importance of the cysteine site of acylation for the DRM partitioning of Gα12 and the lipid raft localization of other biacylated Gα subunits including Gαi in this study (29Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 30Moffett S. Brown D.A. Linder M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we were surprised that Gα12 with only one putative acylation site (32Jones T.L.Z. Gutkind J.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3196-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Ponimaskin E. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was in the DRM fraction and that Gα13 with two or three putative acylation sites (34Ponimaskin E. Behn H. Adarichev V. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Offermanns S. Schmidt M.F.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Bhattacharyya R. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14992-14999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was in the higher density fractions. Not all palmitoylated proteins reside in lipid rafts (37Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), and the stoichiometry of palmitoylation on Gα13 is not known, but our present result suggests that Gα13 evades lipid rafts. Clearly further studies are required to understand the interaction that may prevent Gα13 targeting to lipid rafts. Hsp90 binds to Gα12 but not Gα13 (18Vaiskunaite R. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46088-46093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and Hsp90 can be part of a complex with caveolin (38Gratton J.-P. Fontana J. O'Connor D.S. Garcia-Cardena G. McCabe T.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22268-22272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Hsp90 may be involved in the targeting of Gα12, but not G13, to the DRM fractions. To probe the interaction between Gα12 and Hsp90, we used geldanamycin, a fungal benzoquinone ansamycin, that specifically and tightly binds to the ATP binding site in Hsp90 and inhibits the ability of Hsp90 to form complexes with its substrate proteins (20Richter K. Buchner J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We included the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (39Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) because geldanamycin can increase protein degradation through the ubiquitin/proteosomal pathway (19Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 40Busconi L. Guan J. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1565-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Treatment with MG132 alone did not change the DRM localization of Gα12 (data not shown). Geldanamycin and MG132 treatment of COS cells displaced Gα12 from the DRM fractions and led to the appearance of a 220-kDa band in fractions 6–9 (Fig.3A). Densitometric analysis showed a loss of Gα12 from the DRM fraction of about 60 ± 10% (mean ± S.E. for three experiments) for cells treated with geldanamycin plus MG132 compared with cells treated with vehicle alone. The lipid raft localization of caveolin, Gαi, Gβ, and Fyn was not changed by geldanamycin treatment (Fig.3B). Likewise, geldanamycin treatment did not alter the localization of Gα13 (Fig. 3B) and Na+/K+-ATPase (data not shown) to the higher density fractions. Only a trivial amount of Hsp90 was found in the DRM fraction, consistent with a previous report (41Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. Triantafilou K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with the cytosolic location of this abundant protein (Fig. 3B) (19Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 20Richter K. Buchner J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Hsp90 was not found in the DRMs after geldanamycin treatment. Treatment with geldanamycin alone or with MG132 did not change the total amount of Gα12 (data not shown) in agreement with a previous report (18Vaiskunaite R. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46088-46093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the loss of Gα12 from the DRM fractions after geldanamycin treatment was not due to a general disruption of lipid rafts or degradation of Gα12 but rather suggest it was due to a loss of Hsp90 binding. We also tested the effect of geldanamycin treatment on the DRM localization of the nonpalmitoylated C11S mutant of Gα12to determine the relationship between acylation and Hsp90 binding in the lipid raft localization of Gα12. Geldanamycin treatment of the transfected NIH 3T3 cells led to a further loss of the nonpalmitoylated C11S mutant from the DRM fraction so that the mutant Gα12 was only in the higher density fractions (Fig.4A). An increase in the intensity of the 220-kDa band was also seen after geldanamycin treatment in these cells. This result indicates that acylation and Hsp90 binding act independently to promote the DRM localization of Gα12. We investigated whether Hsp90 interactions maintain Gα12at lipid rafts. The crude membrane fraction of NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with wild-type Gα12 was treated with geldanamycin and MG132 followed by solubilization with Triton X-100 under conditions similar to DRM preparation. Geldanamycin treatment increased the detergent solubility of Gα12 (Fig.4B, membrane) suggesting that Hsp90 interactions maintain Gα12 in the lipid rafts in addition to any possible role in directing Gα12 to these membrane microdomains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a change in lipid raft localization after disruption of Hsp90 binding. Hsp90 is an abundant cytosolic protein that is not directly targeted to lipid rafts so its role in the targeting of Gα12 would be either 1) maintenance of Gα12 in a conformation that permits direct interaction of Gα12 with lipids and proteins in lipid rafts or 2) formation of a complex with proteins that have a high affinity for lipid rafts. In regard to the latter, Hsp90 has multiple protein binding sites (22Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and readily forms complexes with other proteins including proteins that directly associate with lipid rafts (38Gratton J.-P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22268-22272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) or translocate to lipid rafts (41Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. Triantafilou K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a 220-kDa band detected with an antibody to Gα12 in the high density fractions after geldanamycin and MG132 treatment is a novel finding. Higher molecular weight bands of Gα13 were not detected after geldanamycin treatment with antibodies to the amino and carboxyl terminus of Gα13(data not shown). The 220-kDa band was not due to immunoreactivity of another protein that is expressed after geldanamycin treatment because we saw an increase in the 220-kDa band after geldanamycin treatment of the cytosolic fractions of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the wild-type Gα12 (Fig. 4B, cytosol) or COS cells (data not shown). The relative amounts of the 43- and 220-kDa bands could not be determined because the antibody to the amino terminus poorly detects the 43-kDa form probably because palmitoylation obscured the epitope (Fig. 2B), and the antibody to the carboxyl terminus did not detect the 220-kDa form (data not shown). The correlation of the loss of Gα12 immunodetection at 43 kDa in the DRMs (Figs. 3A and 4A) with an increase at 220 kDa suggests that this band is likely to contain the Gα12 protein, possibly as part of another protein or an SDS-resistant aggregate or oligomer. Hsp90 as a molecular chaperone maintains the proper folding of signal transduction proteins, which have an inherent instability because they undergo conformational changes as part of relaying signals (19Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The presence of the 220-kDa band after geldanamycin treatment suggests that Hsp90 may be preventing aggregation of Gα12. Signal transduction requires not only affinity between molecules but also proximity. Some of the defects seen in G12 signaling after mutation of Cys-11, which prevents palmitoylation (32Jones T.L.Z. Gutkind J.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3196-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Ponimaskin E. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), or geldanamycin treatment, which blocks Hsp90 interactions (18Vaiskunaite R. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46088-46093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Pai K.S. Mahajan V.B. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32642-32647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), may be due to mistargeting of Gα12away from its signaling partners. Concentrating G12 in lipid rafts may significantly improve the kinetics of its signaling. Heterogeneity and compartmentalization within cellular membranes can also keep signaling partners apart to prevent interactions and increase the specificity of signaling. The differential membrane targeting of Gα12 and Gα13 may be responsible for increased specificity of receptor coupling seen for Gα12and Gα13 in intact cells under physiologic conditions compared with results using cell membranes (11Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Specific control of the membrane location of G12 and G13 is especially important because they are potent inducers of cell growth, differentiation, shape change, and apoptosis. G12interactions with Hsp90 may explain the tight regulation of G12 signaling and the nonoverlapping functions of G12 and G13 because Hsp90 is both a scaffold and chaperone. If Gα12 remains bound directly or indirectly to Hsp90, it maintains a functional conformation to interact with its signaling partners. If it strays from Hsp90 and its membrane microdomain, Gα12 aggregates and loses activity. Gα12 would then only work when it is in the correct location and thus effectively prevent random collisions with signaling partners during diffusion in the membrane. The inability of Gα12 to compensate for the loss of Gα13 in the Gα13-deficient mice (16Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) may be the result of its poor mobility. Besides Hsp90, Gα12 has also been found to interact with two other scaffold proteins in specialized cells (6Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,13Meyer T.N. Schwesinger C. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24855-24858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). G12 and G13 are like fraternal twins, similar but different. Our finding that they play their roles at different sites on the membrane gives a framework for understanding their regulation and the unfolding story of Hsp90 and G12signaling. More studies are needed to discover the ramifications of their interactions and membrane targeting for G protein signaling.

Because adipose tissue is an important storage depot for cholesterol, we explored evidence that leptin-induced weight loss inob/ob mice was accompanied by transport of cholesterol to the liver and its elimination via bile. Consistent with mobilization of stored cholesterol, cholesterol concentrations in adipose tissue remained unchanged during weight loss. Plasma cholesterol levels fell sharply, and microscopic analyses of gallbladder bile revealed cholesterol crystals as well as cholesterol gallstones. Surprisingly, leptin reduced biliary cholesterol secretion rates without affecting secretion rates of bile salts or phospholipids. Instead, cholesterol supersaturation of gallbladder bile was due to marked decreases in bile salt hydrophobicity and not to hypersecretion of biliary cholesterolper se, such as occurs in humans during weight loss. In addition to regulating bile salt composition, leptin treatment decreased bile salt pool size. The smaller, more hydrophilic bile salt pool was associated with substantial decreases in intestinal cholesterol absorption. Within the liver, leptin treatment reduced the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, but it did not change activities of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase or acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. These data suggest that leptin regulates biliary lipid metabolism to promote efficient elimination of excess cholesterol stored in adipose tissue. Cholesterol gallstone formation during weight loss in ob/ob mice appears to represent a pathologic consequence of an adaptive response that prevents absorption of biliary and dietary cholesterol.

J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with their central role in reverse cholesterol transport, high density lipoproteins (HDL)1 are the principal source of biliary cholesterol (2Carey M.C. Gut. 1997; 41: 721-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3Ji Y. Wang N. Ramakrishnan R. Sehayek E. Huszar D. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33398-33402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In response to biliary secretion of detergent-like bile salt molecules, HDL-derived cholesterol is secreted from hepatocytes into bile together with phospholipid molecules as vesicles (4Cohen D.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 235: 111-120Google Scholar). In leptin-deficient obese C57BL/6J (ob/ob) mice, elevated plasma cholesterol levels are due to increased HDL concentrations (5Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Silver et al. (6Silver D.L. Jiang X.C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4140-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that defective clearance of HDL particles from plasma by the liver in these animals is reversed by leptin administration. Moreover, hepatocytes cultured fromob/ob mice display alterations in HDL processing and cellular cholesterol distribution, which are also normalized by leptin (7Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have reported abnormalities in biliary lipid secretion in Zucker (fa/fa) rats (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which become obese because of a missense mutation in the extracellular domain of the leptin receptor that sharply reduces responsiveness to leptin. Although bile salt secretion rates were preserved, biliary secretion rates of cholesterol and phospholipids were severely reduced. Acute (6 h) infusions of leptin at high doses partially restored biliary cholesterol secretion, and the same treatment in lean Zucker (Fa/−) rats promoted hypersecretion of biliary cholesterol (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that leptin may promote biliary elimination of plasma cholesterol. In ob/ob mice, the expanded adipose tissue mass represents an important storage depot for cholesterol (9Angel A. Farkas J. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 491-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because chronic leptin administration to these animals reduces adiposity (10Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M. Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar, 11Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Baker M.B. Hecht R. Winters D. Boone T. Collins F. Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3884) Google Scholar), excess cholesterol must be mobilized for delivery to the liver and secretion into bile. This study was designed to elucidate a regulatory role for leptin in hepatic cholesterol elimination during leptin-induced weight loss in ob/ob mice. Our results reveal that leptin administration leads to a marked increase in the proportion of hydrophilic bile salts in bile, as well as a sharp decline in the size of the circulating bile salt pool. These changes mechanistically account for reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption, which inhibits both assimilation of dietary cholesterol and reabsorption of biliary cholesterol. However, the reduced capacity of hydrophilic bile salts to solubilize cholesterol within the gallbladder results in cholesterol crystallization and gallstone formation. Recombinant murine leptin was a gift from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). [4-14C]Cholesterol (50 mCi/mmol), [5,6-3H]β-sitostanol (50 Ci/mmol), and oleoyl-[1-14C]CoA (55 mCi/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO).dl-Hydroxy-[3-14C]methylglutaryl-CoA (57 mCi/mmol), dl-[5-3H]mevalonolactone (58 Ci/mmol), and [14C]cholesterol (49 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cholesteryl-[1α, 2α-3H]oleate (24 Ci/mmol) was purchased from AmershamBiosciences. Aluminum and glass silica gel plates were purchased from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). The general chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Male 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice that were homozygous for theob mutation were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled room with 12-h day-night cycles (6 a.m. to 6 p.m. light) and were allowed to adapt to the environment for 2 weeks prior to the experiments. The mice were fed a chow diet (LabDiet 5001, PMI Nutrition International Inc, Brentwood, MO) that contained 4.5% fat and <0.02% cholesterol. Starting at 10 weeks of age, ob/ob mice (n = 80) were treated once daily with intraperitoneal injections of leptin dissolved in saline (10 μg/g of body weight) or an equal volume of saline. To achieve isocaloric intake, saline-injected mice were pair-fed to animals that were administered leptin. The mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of 87 mg/kg ketamine (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and 13 mg/kg xylazine (Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA). Surgery commenced at 9 a.m. with a midline abdominal incision. After inspecting the gallbladder for the presence of gallstones, the common bile duct was ligated with silk sutures. Bile flow was diverted for collection by inserting a PE-10 polyethylene catheter (Becton Dickinson Primary Care Diagnostics, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) into the gallbladder and securing it with silk sutures. The cannula was externalized, and the abdominal incision was closed. The first ∼10 μl containing concentrated gallbladder bile was collected onto a glass microscopy slide for microscopic analysis to determine the presence of cholesterol crystals (12Wang D.Q.-H. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 606-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, hepatic bile was collected by gravity into preweighed Eppendorf tubes for 2-h periods. Bile volume was determined gravimetrically assuming a density of 1 g/ml. At the end of the experiment, the mice were euthanized by cardiac puncture. The livers were immediately excised, rinsed with 0.15 m NaCl to remove blood, weighed, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples of visceral and peripheral fat were also excised and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissue samples were stored at −80 °C prior to analyses. The blood was anticoagulated with EDTA, and plasma was separated by centrifugation and maintained at 4 °C for analysis within 24 h. During surgery and hepatic bile collections, the body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C with a heat lamp. These procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Bile salt pool size was determined essentially as described by Mardones et al. (13Mardones P. Quinones V. Amigo L. Moreno M. Miquel J.F. Schwarz M. Miettinen H.E. Trigatti B. Krieger M. VanPatten S. Cohen D.E. Rigotti A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 170-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the mice were anesthetized as described above. The liver, gallbladder, common bile duct, and small intestine were then harvested and used to prepare ethanolic extracts. Prior to extraction, glycocholate was added as an internal recovery standard. Bile salt masses and compositions were determined by HPLC (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol absorption was measured by a fecal dual isotope ratio method (14Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of 1 μCi of [4-14C]cholesterol and 2 μCi of [5,6-3H]β-sitostanol in 150 μl of medium-chain triglyceride oil (Mead Johnson Nutritionals, Evansville, IN) was delivered by intragastric gavage. The mice were housed individually in cages, and the stools were collected daily for 7 days. The stools were dried, weighed, and ground into powdered form. Radiolabeled sterols were extracted from 1 g of stool samples. The percentage of cholesterol absorbed was calculated from the14C/3H ratio in the extracted sterol mixture (14Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fecal bile salts were quantified enzymatically (15Mashige F. Tanaka N. Maki A. Kamei S. Yamanaka M. Clin. Chem. 1981; 27: 1352-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) following extraction into t-butanol (16van der Meer R. de Vries H. Glatz F.C.J. Benyen A.C. Geeden M.J.H. Katan M.B. Schouten J.A. Cholesterol Metabolism in Health and Disease. Ponsen and Looyen, Wageningen, The Netherlands1985Google Scholar). Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined by enzymatic assays using reagents from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. The plasma lipoproteins were fractionated by fast performance liquid chromatography using a Superose 6 HR10/30 column (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cholesterol concentrations in fractions (0.3 ml) were determined in individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate by mixing 150 μl of each fraction plus 200 μl of cholesterol reagent (Sigma). The color was analyzed using a Titertek Multiskan Plus microplate reader (Eflab, Helsinki, Finland) set to 492 nm. Plasma concentrations of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and HDL cholesterol were calculated as products of total plasma cholesterol concentrations and relative fast performance liquid chromatography peak areas of respective lipoprotein fractions (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic and adipose tissue contents of triglycerides and total as well as free cholesterol were quantified as described previously (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Carr T.P. Andersen C.J. Rudel L.L. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Biliary cholesterol concentrations were determined using the same enzymatic method as for plasma. Biliary bile salt concentrations and compositions were determined by HPLC (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) utilizing glycocholate as an internal standard. The bile salt hydrophobic index was determined according to Heuman (18Heuman D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 719-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentrations in bile were determined by an inorganic phosphorus procedure (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular species of phosphatidylcholines in bile were quantified by HPLC (19Cohen D.E. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1291-1302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Patton G.M. Robins S.J. Kuksis A. Chromatography Library: Lipids in Biomedical Research and Clinical Diagnosis. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1987: 311-347Google Scholar). The biliary secretion rates of cholesterol, phospholipid, and bile salts (nmol/h) were calculated as products of lipid concentrations and bile flow. Hepatic microsomes were prepared by differential ultracentrifugation (21Shefer S. Salen G. Batta A.K. Fears R. Sabine J.R. Methods of Assay. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 43-49Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. The microsomal protein concentrations were determined according to the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Hepatic microsomes were used to measure enzyme activities as follows. Activity of HMG-CoA reductase was determined according to Shapiro and Rodwell (23Shapiro D.J. Rodwell V.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, the microsomes (1 mg of protein) were incubated with 7.5 nmol (0.33 GBq/nmol) of [3-14C]HMG-CoA, 4.5 μmol of glucose-6-phosphate, 3.6 μmol of EDTA, 0.45 μmol of NADP, 0.3 IU of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for 15 min at 37 °C. [3H]Mevalonic acid (0.024 GBq) used as an internal recovery standard was added to stop the reaction. Unlabeled mevalonate (1.2 mg/ml) was added to assist with recovery. The samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow for conversion of mevalonic acid to mevalonolactone. After incubation, the microsomal protein was precipitated by centrifugation for 1 min, and an aliquot of the supernatant (100 μl) was applied to aluminum silica gel TLC plates. The plates were developed in acetone-benzene (1:1 v/v) and then subjected to autoradiography. The area containing mevalonate (Rf = 0.6–0.9) was scraped and quantified by liquid scintillation counting using Ecolume (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA). HMG-CoA reductase activity was expressed as pmol of [14C]mevalonate produced per min per mg of microsomal protein. Recoveries of [3H]mevalonate ranged from 60 to 90%. Activity of Cyp7A1 was measured according to Jelineket al. (24Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]Cholesterol was used as a substrate and delivered as cholesterol-phosphatidylcholine liposomes (1:8 by weight) that were prepared by sonication. An NADPH-regenerating system (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP, and glucose-6-phosphate) was included in the assay as a source of NADPH. After addition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.3 IU), samples containing 1 mg of microsomal protein were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 ml of chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) and 1 ml of 0.05% sulfuric acid. The lower phase was dried under nitrogen, redissolved in chloroform, and then applied to glass silica gel TLC plates together with 7α- and 7β-hydroxycholesterol standards. TLC plates were developed with ethyl acetate-toluene (3:2 v/v), exposed to iodine vapor to identify standards, and then subjected to autoradiography overnight using XAR-5 film (Kodak). Using the developed film as a guide, the locations of [14C]7α-hydroxycholesterol spots were determined, scraped, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting as described above. Hepatic Acat activity was measured by incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA into cholesteryl esters in hepatic microsomes according to Smith et al. (25Smith J.L. de Jersey J. Pillay S.P. Hardie I.R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1986; 158: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Microsomes (1 mg of protein) were preincubated at a final volume of 180 μl with albumin (84 mg/ml) in buffer (50 mmKH2PO4, 100 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2) for 5 min at 37 °C. This was followed by the addition of 20 μl of oleoyl [1-14C]coenzyme A (0.15 GBq/pmol). The reaction was continued for 15 min at 37 °C and then stopped by the addition of 2.5 ml of chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v). After adding [3H]cholesteryl oleate (0.045 GBq) as an internal standard, the reaction mixture was extracted overnight using 2.5 ml of chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) and 1 ml of acidified water. The lower phase was then dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 150 μl of chloroform containing 30 μg of unlabeled cholesteryl oleate, and applied to a glass silica gel TLC plate. The plates were developed in hexane-diethyl ether (9:1 v/v). Cholesteryl oleate was visualized using iodine vapor, scraped from the plate, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting as described above. Recoveries of [3H]cholesteryl oleate ranged from 70 to 90%. The data are expressed as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of the differences between means of the experimental groups was tested by Student’s t test. A difference was considered statistically significant for a two-tailed p< 0.05. Fig. 1 shows trends in body weight during treatment with saline or leptin (10 μg/g). Consistent with well established effects of leptin on body weight in ob/obmice (10Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M. Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar, 11Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Baker M.B. Hecht R. Winters D. Boone T. Collins F. Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3884) Google Scholar), we observed progressive weight loss over the 28-day treatment period (Fig. 1). Mice that were treated with saline lost weight because of pair feeding: Their dietary intake was restricted by 70–80% during the first 7 days and by 40–60% thereafter. For both groups of mice, weight loss was most rapid during the first 14 days. The final body weights (means ± S.E.) were 43.6 ± 0.3 g following saline treatment and 33.6 ± 0.3 g following leptin treatment. Table I presents lipid concentrations in hepatic bile expressed in absolute (mm) and relative (mol %) terms. Because lean body mass and water content of ob/obmice do not change under the experimental conditions of this experiment (10Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M. Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar, 11Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Baker M.B. Hecht R. Winters D. Boone T. Collins F. Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3884) Google Scholar), secretion rates of biliary lipids (nmol/h) in Table I, as well as bile salt pool size (μmol) and fecal bile salt excretion rates (μmol/d) (see below) are presented without normalization to body weight (26Bennion L.J. Grundy S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 996-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In the hepatic bile of saline-treated mice, we observed increases in both absolute and relative cholesterol concentrations at 14 and 28 days. These concentrations were increased to a lesser extent in leptin-treated mice at 14 days, and at 28 days, absolute and relative cholesterol concentrations fell to and below base line, respectively. Absolute concentrations of biliary phospholipids rose to similar extents in leptin- and saline-treated mice at 14 days and decreased to base-line values at 28 days, whereas the relative concentrations did not change. No differences were observed in either absolute or relative biliary bile salt concentrations. Whereas the biliary secretion rates of bile salts and phospholipids decreased to the same degree in leptin- and saline-treated mice, the cholesterol secretion rates decreased only with leptin treatment.Table IBiliary lipid compositions and secretion ratesDayConcentration[TL]Moles percentSecretion rateChPLBSChPLBSChPLBSmmg/dl%nmol/h 00.63 ± 0.031-aThe values are the means ± S.E. and were determined from at least five mice/group at each time point.7.21 ± 0.7620.63 ± 1.381.60 ± 0.112.28 ± 0.1325.03 ± 1.5972.69 ± 1.51105 ± 131155 ± 1473346 ± 361Saline 141.47 ± 0.121-bp <0.05, compared with base line.11.16 ± 1.331-bp <0.05, compared with base line.27.26 ± 3.312.24 ± 0.213.57 ± 0.211-bp <0.05, compared with base line.23.03 ± 2.0173.40 ± 2.13117 ± 10769 ± 1011-bp <0.05, compared with base line.2477 ± 2911-bp <0.05, compared with base line. 280.90 ± 0.121-bp <0.05, compared with base line.7.64 ± 0.8421.19 ± 2.901.68 ± 0.214.10 ± 0.661-bp <0.05, compared with base line.25.74 ± 1.1170.16 ± 1.49112 ± 21720 ± 861-bp <0.05, compared with base line.1987 ± 2791-bp <0.05, compared with base line.Leptin (10 μg/g) 140.98 ± 0.121-bp <0.05, compared with base line.1-cp <0.05, compared with saline treatment.10.13 ± 0.381-bp <0.05, compared with base line.23.34 ± 2.081.98 ± 0.112.53 ± 0.211-cp <0.05, compared with saline treatment.26.94 ± 1.7270.53 ± 1.8769 ± 121-bp <0.05, compared with base line.1-cp <0.05, compared with saline treatment.679 ± 1001-bp <0.05, compared with base line.1705 ± 2841-bp <0.05, compared with base line. 280.57 ± 0.031-cp <0.05, compared with saline treatment.7.98 ± 0.1921.18 ± 0.541.68 ± 0.041.93 ± 0.061-bp <0.05, compared with base line.1-cp <0.05, compared with saline treatment.26.85 ± 0.3971.22 ± 0.3653 ± 31-bp <0.05, compared with base line.1-cp <0.05, compared with saline treatment.737 ± 341-bp <0.05, compared with base line.1961 ± 1141-bp <0.05, compared with base line.Ch, cholesterol; PL, phospholipid; BS, bile salt; [TL], total lipid concentration.1-a The values are the means ± S.E. and were determined from at least five mice/group at each time point.1-b p <0.05, compared with base line.1-c p <0.05, compared with saline treatment.

Microscopic analyses of gallbladder bile from ob/ob mice (n = 14) prior to saline or leptin treatment revealed that none contained cholesterol crystals or gallstones. However, following the period of rapid weight loss at 14 days (Fig. 1), abundant cholesterol monohydrate crystals and cholesterol gallstones were detected in 8 of 18 (44%) and 2 of 18 (11%) of leptin-treated mice, respectively. In mice treated with saline (n = 18), no cholesterol crystals or gallstones were observed. These findings were unchanged at 28 days. To gain mechanistic insights into the physicochemical events observed by microscopic analysis of gallbladder bile, we analyzed the molecular species of bile salts in mouse hepatic biles (Fig.2A). As described previously for rat bile, HPLC resolved five major bile salt species comprising >90% of biliary bile salts, with tauro-α-, tauro-β-, and tauro-ω-muricholate eluting in one peak (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Leptin treatment was associated with substantial increases in the proportions of tauromuricholates and decreases in the proportions of taurocholate. In saline-treated mice, similar trends were observed, but they were much less pronounced. At 14 days, leptin also reduced the contents of the hydrophobic bile salts taurochenodeoxycholate and taurodeoxycholate. Fig. 2B displays the hydrophobic index of bile salts. The hydrophobic index is a concentration-weighted average of HPLC-determined hydrophobicities of individual bile salts present in a mixture (18Heuman D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 719-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This parameter allows the overall hydrophobicity of a mixture of bile salts to be represented by a single value. The bile salt hydrophobic index decreased markedly in leptin-treated mice compared with saline-treated mice. HPLC resolved nine major peaks corresponding to ten phosphatidylcholine molecular species that accounted for >95% of phosphatidylcholines (8VanPatten S. Ranginani N. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Rossetti L. Cohen D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G393-G404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with saline treatment at 28 days, leptin increased the proportion (mol %, means ± S.E.) of 16:0–18:2 (saline, 55.5 ± 0.5; leptin, 60.5 ± 0.4) phosphatidylcholine molecular species in bile. Decreases were observed in the proportions of 16:1–16:1 (saline, 0.76 ± 0.06; leptin, 0.41 ± 0.04), 16:1–20:4 (saline, 5.73 ± 0.31; leptin, 2.86 ± 0.26), 16:0–20:4 (saline, 9.87 ± 0.18; leptin, 8.61 ± 0.39), 18:0–18:2 (saline, 5.49 ± 0.12; leptin, 4.56 ± 0.15), and 18:0–18:1 (saline, 0.50 ± 0.01; leptin, 0.27 ± 0.07) phosphatidylcholines. There were no changes in the proportions of 16:1–18:2 (saline, 3.32 ± 0.04; leptin, 3.06 ± 0.30), 16:0–22:6 (saline, 4.63 ± 0.36; leptin, 5.40 ± 0.25), and 16:0–18:1 plus 18:0–20:4 (saline, 12.49 ± 0.37; leptin, 12.42 ± 0.41) phosphatidylcholine molecular species. Fig. 3A shows the effect of leptin on bile salt pool size. Compared with more modest decreases that were observed at 14 days in saline-treated mice, leptin markedly decreased bile salt pool sizes at 14 days. At 28 days, there were further decreases in the pool sizes of saline-treated mice. However, the values did not fall to those observed with leptin administration. The bile salt species and hydrophobic index of bile salts comprising the bile salt pool (data not shown) were similar to those of hepatic bile in Fig. 2. The rates of fecal bile salt excretion (Fig.3B) were decreased in both leptin- and saline-treated mice compared with base line. The fecal bile salt excretion rate did not differ in leptin-treated mice compared with saline-treated mice. As evidenced by reduced fecal bile salt excretion during the period spanning 14–21 days, the reduction in bile salt pool size because of leptin treatment was largely completed within the first 14 days. Because cholesterol absorption is regulated by both bile salt hydrophobicity (14Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J.

Both vesicle fusion and vesicle formation can be inhibited by the addition of calcium chelators. Because the effects of calcium chelators have been studied predominantly in cell-free systems, it is not clear exactly which transport steps in the secretory pathway are sensitive to calcium levels. In this regard, we have studied the effects of calcium chelators on both anterograde and retrograde protein transport in whole cells. Using both cytochemical and biochemical analyses, we find that the anterograde-directed exit of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and the retrograde-directed exit of Shiga toxin from the Golgi apparatus are both inhibited by calcium chelation. The exit of vesicular stomatitis virus G from a pre-Golgi compartment and the exit of Shiga toxin from an endosomal compartment are sensitive to the membrane-permeant calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-amino phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid–tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM). By contrast, endoplasmic reticulum exit and endocytic internalization from the plasma membrane are not affected by BAPTA. Together, our data show that some, but not all, trafficking steps in the cell may be regulated by calcium. These studies provide a framework for a more detailed analysis of the role of calcium as a regulatory agent during protein transport.

The modulation of cytosolic calcium levels serves as an important signaling system for cell regulation (1Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein transport within the secretory pathway is among the processes regulated by calcium. The best characterized role for calcium in vesicular transport is in the calcium-triggered fusion of synaptic and secretory vesicles at the plasma membrane (2Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 3Brunger A.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Hu K. Carroll J.

Calcium-regulated vesicle fusion and fusion reactions in the constitutive secretory pathway have similar molecular mechanisms. For example, both types of fusion reactions are mediated or regulated by SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-amino phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid–tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester); VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; STB, Shiga toxin B-fragment; NRK, normal rat kidney; endo H, endoglycosidase H. 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-amino phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid–tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester); VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; STB, Shiga toxin B-fragment; NRK, normal rat kidney; endo H, endoglycosidase H. proteins, as well asrab- and sec1/munc18-related proteins (5Jahn R Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that a regulatory role for calcium may also extend to fusion reactions in the constitutive secretory pathway. Both major organelles of the early secretory pathway, the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, are known to be cellular calcium stores (6Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 7Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. Park M.K. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 271-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Secretory vesicles have also been shown recently to act as a dynamic calcium store (8Mitchell K.J. Pinton P. Varadi A. Tacchetti C. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Two classes of ATP-dependent pump proteins maintain high lumenal calcium concentrations in these organelles. The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA)-type pumps are found both on the ER and the Golgi (9Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol.

Pmr1p was identified as a Golgi calcium pump in yeast (12Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and mutations in the mammalian isoform lead to Hailey-Hailey disease (13Sudbrak R. Brown J. Dobson-Stone C. Carter S. Ramser J.

Genet. 2000; 9: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Studies analyzing the subcellular localization of calcium indicate that calcium concentrations are particularly high in the Golgi region of cells and that calcium gradients could exist among organelles of the secretory pathway (6Pinton P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29822-29829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Both the ER and the Golgi apparatus have also been shown to have inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors for the triggered release of calcium during cell signaling (1Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol.

The calcium-binding chaperone proteins calreticulin and calnexin function in the ER (16Jakob C.A. Chevet E. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Results Probl.

At least three lumenal calcium-binding proteins, Cab45, CALNUC (nucleobindin), and p54/NEFA have been localized to the Golgi (11Lin P., Le- Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M. Jin M.

The presence of calcium stores and specific calcium-binding proteins in secretory organelles has revived the notion that calcium or calcium gradients are important for regulating the constitutive secretory pathway (20Sambrook J.F. Cell. 1990; 61: 197-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Studies on ER to Golgi transport in yeast and in semi-intact (perforated) cells have indeed indicated a role for calcium in this trafficking step (21Beckers C.J.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 22Baker D. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. Botstein D. Segev N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Regulation by calcium has also been implicated in homotypic vacuolar fusion (25Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), in late endosome-lysosome heterotypic fusion and the reformation of lysosomes from hybrid organelles (26Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and in fusion between endosomal compartments (27Mayorga L.S. Beron W. Sarrouf M.N. Colombo M.I. Creutz C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30927-30934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are several lines of evidence showing that calcium is important for the function of the Golgi apparatus. Most directly, calcium chelators have been shown to block intra-Golgi protein transportin vitro (28Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The brefeldin A-induced retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum is also affected by calcium chelation (29Ivessa N.E., De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Gravotta D. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 25960-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Calmodulin has been shown to mediate the effects of calcium on several of these fusion or transport reactions (25Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 28Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the calcium chelator BAPTA is often found to be more effective than EGTA at inhibiting these membrane fusion reactions (25Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 26Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30927-30934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BAPTA has a much faster on rate for calcium binding than does EGTA. This observation is frequently interpreted to indicate that calcium transients or gradients rather than steady-state calcium levels regulate these processes. We have recently reported that in addition to regulating membrane fusion reactions, calcium may play a role in regulating the coating or uncoating of transport vesicles. We found that treating cells with the membrane-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM led to the dissociation of the COPI vesicle coat protein, coatomer, from the Golgi apparatus (31Ahluwalia J.P. Topp J.D. Weirather K. Zimmerman M. Stamnes M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34148-34155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using cell-free Golgi binding assays, we also observed that the addition of BAPTA led to the rapid dissociation of coatomer from previously coated Golgi membranes. As with fusion, BAPTA was more effective than EGTA at mediating this effect. The addition of calcium chelators appears to affect a step in vesicle coat assembly after the recruitment of ADP-ribosylation factor, the small GTP-binding protein that triggers coat assembly. The previous studies strongly implicate a role for calcium in regulating transport through the constitutive exocytic and endocytic protein transport pathways. These studies have utilized cell-free systems, and thus it is still not clear to what extent calcium modulates transport through the secretory system in whole cells. As a step toward clarifying the role of calcium in transport, we have analyzed the effects of membrane-permeant calcium chelators on both anterograde and retrograde protein transport through the secretory pathway. This study indicates that select transport steps are sensitive to calcium transients or gradients. Tissue culture media were obtained through the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center, University of Iowa. The construct pT77-SLT-B-Glyc-KDEL was obtained as gifts from Drs. B. Goud and A. Girod. BAPTA-AM and EGTA-AM were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-rat mannosidase II (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA), polyclonal anti-VSV G (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Naka-Ku Nagoya, Japan), P5D4 monoclonal anti-VSV G (32Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), anti-BiP (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO), and anti-biotin (Sigma). The cell line Gts-NRK (a gift from Dr. V. Malhotra) that stably expresses the temperature-sensitive ts045-VSV G was maintained by growth at a permissive temperature (32 °C) in α-minimum essential medium plus 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated for 14–16 h at a restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) to accumulate VSV G protein in the ER and processed for immunofluorescence. For VSV G protein transport assay, the cells were incubated at 39.5 °C for 14–16 h, and then VSV G protein was released from the temperature block by switching the cells to 32 °C medium containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. The cells were incubated for 15 or 90 min at (32 °C) and processed for immunofluorescence. BAPTA-AM or EGTA-AM was added at the indicated times by replacing the medium with medium containing 50 μm BAPTA-AM or 50 μm EGTA-AM plus 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Where indicated, 2 μmA23187(Sigma), 3 mm EGTA, or 5 mm CaCl2were also added to the medium. Gts-NRK cells were plated onto glass cover slips, and after 24 h the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min at room temperature. The formaldehyde was quenched with 50 mm ammonium chloride for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 2.5% donkey serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Appropriate dilutions of the anti VSV G, anti-mannosidase II, and anti-BiP antibodies in the blocking buffer were added to the cells for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times, mounted on slides, and analyzed on a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Gts-NRK cells were incubated with or without 50 μm BAPTA-AM in α-minimum essential medium for 90 min at 39.5 °C. The cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated, and embedded in Spurr's embedding medium. Ultrathin sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate were examined with an H-7000 transmission electron microscope. To construct a vector expressing Shiga toxin B-fragment (STB) with an N-glycosylation site, PCR was employed. PCR primers T7 (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′) and STB-WT1 (5′-AAT GGA TCC TCA TTC AGA GCT AGT AGA A-3′) were used with plasmid pT77-SLT-B-Glyc-KDEL. The resulting fragment was verified by sequencing and then cloned into the pET11a vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to make pETSTB-Glyc. The recombinant Shiga toxin B-fragment was overexpressed in the BL21(DE3)pLysS bacterial strain (Stratagene) and purified using ion exchange chromatography as described (33Johannes L. Tenza D. Antony C. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19554-19561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) except that a High Q column (Bio-Rad) was used in place of Mono Q column. The STB was labeled using activated Cy2 for fluorescence microscopy (Amersham Biosciences; HP7 9NA) or activated biotin for Western blot analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 2 μg/ml labeled STB. The cells were then washed three times with fresh medium and incubated for various times as described in the figure legends. The proteins were fractionated using SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using standard protocol for the Bio-Rad minigel and blotting apparatuses. Following the transfer, the membranes were incubated with appropriate dilutions of the indicated primary antibodies. The signal was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and ECL (AmershamBiosciences). The treatment of VSV G protein with endoglycosidase H (Calbiochem) was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. For STB glycosylation analysis, the toxin was labeled with biotin (Pierce) using appropriate molar ratio of biotin to protein. STB-biotin was detected by Western blotting using anti-biotin antibodies. In some experiments, the cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μg/ml tunicamycin 1 h before the addition of STB. We used a NRK cell line constitutively expressing a temperature-sensitive VSV G (ts045) to analyze the effects of calcium chelation on anterograde protein transport through the secretory pathway. VSV G (ts045) is trapped in the ER at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) but is transported normally through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane at the permissive temperature (32 °C). The transport of VSV G was monitored using both fluorescence microscopy (Fig.1) and by determining the glycosylation state of the VSV G (Fig. 2). Following a 16-h incubation at the restrictive temperature, the VSV G is localized to a dispersed ER compartment (Fig. 1 A). When cells were switched to a permissive temperature (32 °C) for 15 min, the VSV G was relocated to the juxtanuclear Golgi compartment (Fig.1 B). After 90 min at the permissive temperature, VSV G was found dispersed in small punctate and tubular structures and at the cell surface (Fig. 1 C). In some cells, a small amount of residual Golgi-like staining was also observed. ER-localized, core-glycosylated VSV G protein is sensitive to deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H (endo H), whereas complex oligosaccharides generated by processing in the Golgi are endo H-resistant. Endo H digestion of cell extracts following the incubation at the restrictive temperature confirms that the VSV G from these cells is completely endo H-sensitive and thus has not been processed by the Golgi (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 2). Following a 90-min incubation at the permissive temperature, all of the VSV G in cells is endo H-resistant, indicating that it has been transported through the Golgi (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4).Figure 2The early addition of BAPTA-AM blocks VSV G transport to the Golgi. Shown are Western blots of Gts-NRK cell lysates probed with anti-VSV G antibodies. A, prior to the lysis the cells had been incubated at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) for 16 h (lanes 1 and 2) or incubated at the restrictive temperature for 16 h and then shifted to the permissive temperature (32 °C) for 90 min (lanes 3–12). As in Fig. 1, BAPTA-AM was omitted (lanes 1–4) or added (lanes 5–12) at the indicated time relative to the temperature switch. Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) was added to the samples where indicated to determine whether Golgi processing of oligosaccharide chains had occurred. B, cells were treated exactly as in A except that A23187 (2 μm), CaCl2 (5 mm), or EGTA (3 mm) was added 30 min prior to the temperature switch in addition to or instead of the BAPTA-AM as indicated. N/A, not applicable.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine what effect calcium chelation had on VSV G transport, we treated cells with the membrane-permeant calcium chelator BAPTA-AM at various times relative to the switch from the restrictive to the permissive temperature. When BAPTA-AM was added to the cells either 90 min (not shown) or 30 min (Fig. 1 D) prior to the switch from the restrictive to the permissive temperature, we observed a marked difference in the localization of VSV G. Instead of localizing to the dispersed post-Golgi structures and the plasma membrane, VSV G was now found to localize to large, brightly labeled perinuclear punctate structures (Fig. 1, compare C and D). We examined whether the VSVG-containing punctate structures observed upon BAPTA-AM treatment were a pre- or post-Golgi compartment by testing whether the VSV G was endo H-resistant under this condition. Fig. 2 A shows that when BAPTA-AM was added at least 30 min prior to switching the cells to the permissive temperature, the majority of the VSV G was endo H-sensitive and thus had not reached the Golgi (lanes 5–8). Fig. 2 B shows that the block in ER to Golgi transport by BAPTA-AM is reversed when intracellular calcium levels are restored by the addition of the calcium ionophoreA23187 and CaCl2 to the medium. Together, the fluorescence microscopy and biochemical analysis demonstrate that when BAPTA-AM is added prior to the switch to the permissive temperature, VSV G is blocked in a pre-Golgi compartment. The punctate perinuclear structures could result from an alteration in ER morphology caused by the presence of BAPTA. Alternatively, in the presence of BAPTA, the VSV G might exit the ER and then become trapped in a punctate ER/Golgi intermediate compartment. We examined the morphology of both the ER and the Golgi following BAPTA treatment to differentiate between these possibilities. As shown in Fig.3, immunofluorescence using anti-mannosidase II antibodies to label the Golgi (C andD) and anti-Bip antibodies to label the ER (A andB) revealed that BAPTA treatment had little or no effect on the morphology of either of these organelles. In particular, no punctate Bip-positive ER elements analogous to the VSV G-containing structures shown in Fig. 1 D were observed. As expected from our previous studies (31Ahluwalia J.P. Topp J.D. Weirather K. Zimmerman M. Stamnes M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34148-34155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), coatomer was found to be dissociated from the Golgi after treatment with BAPTA-AM (not shown). Ultrastructural characterization also reveals that the morphology of the Golgi apparatus is not overtly affected in cells following treatment with the calcium chelator (Fig. 3, E and F). The electron micrographs show that the Golgi is of similar size and retains a stacked structure after treatment with BAPTA for 90 min. Together, our results reveal that addition of BAPTA-AM and thus a decrease in cytosolic free calcium does not block the exit of VSV G from the ER. However, it prevents VSV G transport to the Golgi apparatus and causes the accumulation of VSV G in a punctate perinuclear ER/Golgi intermediate compartment. The addition of BAPTA-AM to the cells simultaneously with the switch to the permissive temperature caused VSV G to accumulate in a juxtanuclear structure reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1 E). Colocalization studies revealed that indeed, under this condition, VSV G localization overlaps almost completely with the Golgi marker mannosidase II (Fig. 4). Fig.2 A shows that when BAPTA-AM is added at the same time as the temperature switch, all of the VSV G becomes endo H-resistant (lanes 9 and 10), confirming that it has now reached the Golgi. Together, the data indicate two distinct blocks in anterograde protein transport of VSV G in the presence of BAPTA-AM: one block in an ER/Golgi intermediate compartment and a second block either within or from the Golgi apparatus. We were not able to detect any additional effects of calcium chelation on VSV G transport in post-Golgi transport steps by adding BAPTA-AM after the temperature switch. The addition of BAPTA-AM 30 min after the temperature switch caused a small amount of VSV G to accumulate in the Golgi of some cells, but there was no obvious accumulation of VSV G in any additional structure that might represent a transport intermediate between the Golgi and the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, compare Cand F). This finding is consistent with a previous study showing that there are no defects in protein transport when a calcium ionophore and EGTA are added to cells after a 1-h pulse-chase (34Duncan J.S. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both calcium-sensitive membrane fusion reactions and COPI coat assembly share the property that they are more sensitive to BAPTA than to EGTA (25Peters C. Mayer A.

Because BAPTA has a much faster on-rate for calcium binding, this difference has been interpreted to indicate that a calcium transient or gradient may be involved. If the effects of BAPTA-AM in the whole cell analysis reflect the effects of BAPTA in cell-free fusion and budding assays, we predicted that whole cell trafficking might also be more sensitive to BAPTA than to EGTA. Thus, we compared the effects of EGTA-AM and BAPTA-AM on VSV G transport. Fig. 5 shows that there was no obvious accumulation of VSV G in the Golgi or in a pre-Golgi compartment upon treatment with EGTA-AM. Furthermore, biochemical analysis revealed that VSV G became endo H-resistant regardless of when EGTA-AM was added relative to the switch to the permissive temperature (Fig.6). Although 50 μm BAPTA-AM was a more effective inhibitor than 50 μm EGTA-AM, 3 mm EGTA, which is not membrane permeant, inhibited VSVG transport to the Golgi when added together with a calcium ionophore (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). These findings support the model that BAPTA-AM inhibits protein transport by disrupting intracellular calcium levels (see “Discussion”).Figure 6EGTA-AM does not block anterograde transit of VSV G through the Golgi apparatus. Shown are Western blots of Gts-NRK cell lysates probed with anti-VSV G antibodies. Prior to the lysis, the cells had been incubated at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) or incubated at the restrictive temperature and shifted to the permissive temperature (32 °C) as in Fig. 2. EGTA-AM was omitted or added at the indicated time relative to the temperature switch. Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) was added to the samples where indicated to determine whether Golgi processing of oligosaccharide chains had occurred.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although the majority of proteins move through the secretory pathway in an anterograde direction, retrograde protein transport also plays an important role in the function of the secretory pathway. Retrograde transport is necessary for the retrieval of escaped resident organelle proteins, for the recycling of proteins that function in transport, and for quality control and protein degradation. Some bacterial toxins such as cholera toxin and Shiga toxin have proven to be good tools for studying retrograde protein transport through secretory organelles (35Johannes L. Goud B.

These toxins are endocytosed into cells and are then transported from endosomes through the Golgi apparatus to the ER (35Johannes L. Goud B.

Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The toxins are transported from the lumen of the ER into the cytosol where they then exert their toxic effect (40Sandvig K.

We have used the Shiga-like toxin B subunit to analyze the effects of BAPTA-AM on retrograde protein transport. For these experiments, recombinant STB was purified and covalently labeled with Cy2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Vero cells were incubated with the labeled toxin for 30 min to allow the toxin to internalize. The noninternalized toxin was then washed away with fresh medium, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 0.5–16 h. The location of STB in the cell was monitored by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.7). In addition, we used a recombinant form of Shiga toxin that was engineered to contain anN-glycosylation site (33Johannes L. Tenza D. Antony C. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19554-19561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 41White J. Johannes L. Mallard F. Girod A. Grill S. Reinsch S. Keller P. Tzschaschel B. Echard A. Goud B. Stelzer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) to detect the arrival of the STB in the ER biochemically (Fig. 8). Fluorescence microscopy shows that the internalized STB first appeared in punctate endosomal compartments and then within 2 h became concentrated in the Golgi (Fig. 7). Diffuse ER-like staining was also observed by microscopy after 2-h incubations. As a more precise indicator of STB arrival in the ER, we examined its glycosylation state. Consistent with previous studies (33Johannes L. Tenza D. Antony C. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19554-19561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we observed three distinct STB bands on Western blots following retrograde transport of STB through the secretory pathway (Fig. 8). We confirmed that the uppermost band corresponds to the core-glycosylated form of STB by treating cells with tunicamycin to block core glycosylation (Fig.8 A, lanes 6–10). Fig. 8 A shows that STB starts to arrive in the ER at about 2 h after the addition of the toxin (lane 2). We observed a peak of STB glycosylation at about 4 h after addition of the toxin to the cells (Fig.8 A, lane 3).Figure 8BAPTA-AM blocks the arrival of STB in the ER. Shown are Western blot analyses of Vero cell lysates following incubations with STB-biotin. A, cells were incubated for 30 min with STB-biotin, washed, and incubated for the indicated times in the absence of STB. The incubations were done in the presence and the absence of tunicamycin to identify the band resulting from core glycosylation in the ER (glyc-STB). B, cells were incubated for 30 min with STB-biotin followed by a 4-h chase in the absence of STB. Either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent or BAPTA-AM were added at the indicated times relative to the addition of the STB-biotin. The BAPTA-AM or dimethyl sulfoxide was present throughout the remainder of the 4-h chase period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We determined the effects of calcium chelation on the retrograde transport of STB by adding BAPTA-AM to the cells at different times relative to the addition of the STB. We found that when BAPTA-AM was added at the same time or prior to the addition of STB, the toxin was internalized but appeared to accumulate in punctate endosomal compartments (Fig. 7). Although the Golgi had normal morphology under these conditions (Fig. 3), we never observed colocalization of STB with the Golgi when BAPTA-AM was added early (not shown). Determination of the glycosylation state of STB confirmed that it remained unglycosylated and thus did not reach the ER when BAPTA-AM was added to the cells at the same time as STB (Fig. 8 B, lane 2). The results indicate that although internalization of STB into an endosomal compartment is not affected by calcium chelation, its transport from an endosomal compartment to the Golgi is blocked by the presence of the calcium chelator. Previous studies indicate that STB is transported directly from early endosomes to the Golgi, bypassing the late endosomes (42Mallard F. Antony C. Tenza D. Salamero J. Goud B. Johannes L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 973-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Our results indicate a requirement for calcium in this direct trafficking step. We found that addition of BAPTA-AM up to 60 min after the addition of STB completely blocked the transport of STB to the ER as revealed by its failure to be glycosylated (Fig. 8 B, lanes 2,4, and 6). When BAPTA-AM was added 90 or 120 min after STB, glycosylated STB was observed, indicating that at least some STB had moved beyond a BAPTA-sensitive transport step and arrived in the ER (Fig. 8 B, lanes 8 and 10). Interestingly, by comparing the localization of STB with its glycosylation state, we found that although STB is not glycosylated when BAPTA is added 60 min after the addition of STB to the cells (Fig.8 B, lane 6), some of the STB is localized to a juxtanuclear Golgi compartment (Fig. 7). We interpret this to indicate that some of the STB has arrived at the Golgi by 60 min and that BAPTA has inhibited a Golgi to ER retrograde transport step. Thus, as was the case for anterograde transport, it appears that some retrograde transport steps, such as the internalization (endocytosis) of STB, are insensitive to calcium chelation, whereas other steps, such as endosome to Golgi apparatus and Golgi to ER transport, are inhibited in the presence of the calcium chelator BAPTA. Previous studies have shown that both membrane fusion reactions and vesicle assembly reactions are inhibited by the calcium chelator BAPTA. Because these studies have relied on the cell-free reconstitution of these processes, we have set out to determine whether steps in constitutive anterograde and retrograde protein transport are affected by calcium chelators in whole cells. The use of the membrane permeant analogs, BAPTA-AM and EGTA-AM, is particularly effective for these studies because the analogs do not bind calcium until they have entered the cell and the acetoxymethyl ester moiety has been hydrolyzed. Because normal extracellular calcium levels are maintained, the cells remain attached to their substrate, allowing relatively normal cell morphology to be maintained. This has allowed the combined immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis we report in this paper. This combined approach has revealed that at least four resolvable steps are inhibited by treating cells with BAPTA-AM. The BAPTA-sensitive steps during anterograde transport of VSV G through the secretory pathway include intermediate compartment to Golgi transport and exit from the Golgi apparatus. During retrograde transport through the secretory pathway, we find that transport of STB from the endosome to the Golgi is inhibited as well as transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. At least two transport steps were found to be resistant to BAPTA-AM. These include endocytosis of STB from the plasma membrane and the exit of VSV G from the ER. A surprising aspect of this and many other studies examining the effects of calcium chelators on reactions involved in protein transport is that BAPTA acts more effectively as an inhibitor than EGTA. One possibility is that the fast initial binding rate of BAPTA is able to buffer calcium transients that are not buffered by EGTA. A second possibility is that under biological conditions (or within certain biological microenvironments), the calcium-binding constant for BAPTA is in fact smaller than for EGTA. A third explanation is that BAPTA acts in some manner other than by chelating calcium. For example, BAPTA has been shown to act as an inhibitor of phospholipase D (43Coorssen J.R. Haslam R.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results, in conjunction with other studies, are most consistent with BAPTA disrupting protein transport by acting as a calcium chelator. First, for the cell-free studies (28Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Ahluwalia J.P. Topp J.D. Weirather K. Zimmerman M. Stamnes M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34148-34155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and for ER to Golgi transport in whole cells (Fig. 2), the addition of calcium reverses the effects of BAPTA. Thus, if BAPTA is acting directly on a protein, it is only the non-calcium-bound form that is able to do so. Second, we find that disrupting intracellular calcium levels in a BAPTA-independent manner with an ionophore and extracellular EGTA also disrupts ER to Golgi transport (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, in cell-free studies on membrane fusion and Golgi transport where BAPTA is more effective than EGTA, calmodulin has been shown to be involved (25Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 28Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Colombo M.I. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This provides independent evidence of a role for calcium in reactions disrupted specifically by BAPTA. Finally, we showed previously that although BAPTA is more effective than EGTA at uncoating COPI vesicles, EGTA did have an effect when added at a higher concentration (31Ahluwalia J.P. Topp J.D. Weirather K. Zimmerman M. Stamnes M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34148-34155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that several transport steps in the cell are affected by chelating calcium with BAPTA. Because both vesicle fusion and vesicle formation are potentially regulated by calcium, an important remaining question is which of the transport blocks result from an effect on membrane fusion and which ones result from an effect on vesicle formation. Regulating vesicle formation or vesicle fusion independently could lead to an accumulation or a depletion of vesicles. For example, increasing the rate of fusion without a concomitant increase in the rate of vesicle formation would lead to vesicle depletion. An interesting possibility is that both processes are regulated simultaneously at calcium-sensitive transport steps. By coordinating the rate of vesicle fusion and the rate of vesicle formation and uncoating through similar calcium-mediated regulatory mechanisms, the problem of vesicle accumulation or depletion might be avoided. Future studies on the role of calcium on fusion reactions and in vesicle coating and uncoating reactions in the secretory pathway should provide additional insight into this regulation. We thank Dr. Lois Weismann for helpful discussion."

As monomers, SNARE motifs are unstructured (4Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol.

When appropriate sets of SNARE motifs are mixed, they spontaneously assemble into tight bundles of α-helices, a reaction that is thought to tie membranes together and to initiate fusion. After fusion, SNARE complexes are disassembled by the chaperone-like ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor in conjunction with cofactors, thus reactivating the SNAREs for another round of membrane fusion (6Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).Since assembly and disassembly of SNARE motifs is essential for fusion, major efforts have been made to understand these reactions in detail. From these studies, a few principles have emerged that appear to be valid for all SNAREs. First, SNARE complexes are represented by elongated four-helix bundles whose structure is remarkably conserved despite considerable sequence heterogeneity (7Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 8Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Each helix is contributed by a different SNARE motif, and each motif occupies a unique position in the four-helix bundle (9Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In the middle of the bundle is a highly conserved layer of four interacting polar side chains (three glutamines and one arginine), each contributed by one of the SNARE motifs. These observations led to their classification into Q- and R-SNAREs (7Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Second, different SNAREs can be substituted for each other to a certain extent as long as they occupy equivalent positions (11Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Many SNAREs possess N-terminal extensions that represent independently folded domains. These domains have emerged as candidates for controlling the activity of the adjacent SNARE motifs. In the best studied examples, the neuronal syntaxin 1 and its yeast plasma membrane homologue Sso1p, the N-terminal domain consists of a three-helix bundle (17Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8470-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that interacts intramolecularly with the SNARE motif, resulting in an equilibrium between a “closed” and an “open” conformation (19Dulubova I.

Since in the closed conformation the SNARE motif of syntaxin cannot bind to other SNAREs, the N-terminal domain can down-regulate the capability of syntaxin to form SNARE complexes. Indeed, removal of the N-terminal domain of Sso1p has been shown to accelerate SNARE complex assembly (22Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and removal of this domain in syntaxin 1 accelerates SNARE-mediated liposome fusion (23Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Munc18–1, a protein of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family, binds tightly to the closed conformation of syntaxin 1 and stabilizes it (19Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 24Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Thus, Munc-18–1 may serve as a negative regulator that prevents syntaxin from forming SNARE complexes, although undoubtedly it has an essential role in exocytosis (25Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Hence, the N-terminal domains of SNAREs may serve as inhibitors of the adjacent SNARE motifs, operating by intramolecular interactions that sometimes may be controlled by other factors.To what extent the properties summarized above are general or represent specializations of each SNARE is still under debate. First, the structures of the N-terminal domains are not conserved in all SNAREs. Vam3p and Sed5p, two additional yeast syntaxins, possess three-helix bundles in their N-terminal regions that are similar to those of syntaxin 1 and Sso1p (26Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I. Min S.W. Chen X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) However, the N terminus of Vam7p contains a Phox domain that appears to be unique for this SNARE and that is required for membrane attachment (28Cheever M.L.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5956-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also structurally different are the N-terminal domains of Sec22p (30Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Weis W.I. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24203-24211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Ykt6p (31Tochio H. Tsui M.M. Banfield D.K. Zhang M. Science. 2001; 293: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both consist of a mixed α-helical/β-sheet profilin-like fold that, based on sequence alignments, may also be present in VAMP7 (also referred to as TI-VAMP). Second, it is unclear to which extent N-terminal domains interact with their respective SNARE motifs even if they have the same fold as syntaxin 1. In Sso1p, the domain binds to the SNARE motif even more tightly than in syntaxin 1 (22Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In contrast, no such binding was observed in Vam3p (26Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This difference may be explained by the fact that a surface groove that binds to the SNARE motif in Sso1p and syntaxin 1 is lacking in the Vam3p three-helix bundle. Of the N-terminal domains with different folds, that of Sec22b does not have an influence on the rate of SNARE assembly in vitro (30Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Weis W.I. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24203-24211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ykt6p adopts a closed conformation that retards SNARE complex assembly (31Tochio H. Tsui M.M. Banfield D.K. Zhang M. Science. 2001; 293: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Third, the SM protein Sec1p does not bind to the closed conformation of Sso1p but rather to SNARE complexes containing Sso1p (32Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, the yeast syntaxins Sed5p and Ufe1p have recently been shown to bind to their corresponding SM protein, Sly1p, via a short peptide motif at the very N terminus of their sequence outside the three-helix bundle (27Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I. Min S.W. Chen X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Previously, we have characterized a SNARE complex that mediates fusion of late endosomes (8Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Unlike the synaptic SNARE complex, in which only syntaxin 1 contains a large N-terminal region, three of the four SNAREs of the endosomal complex contain long N-terminal regions (syntaxin 7, vti1b, and syntaxin 8). In this study, we have determined whether these three SNAREs contain three-helix bundles in their N-terminal regions or include domains with different folds. Furthermore, we investigated whether the N-terminal domain of any of these SNAREs interacts with the SNARE motif and whether the presence of the N-terminal domain affects the rate of SNARE complex formation.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have analyzed the N-terminal regions of the endosomal SNAREs syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, and vti1b using biophysical techniques. All three regions contain well folded α-helical domains. In syntaxin 7 and vti1b, they constitute three-helix bundles similar to those determined previously for syntaxin1, Sso1p, and Vam3p. For the N-terminal domain of syntaxin 8, a similar fold is likely, but no certain conclusion can be drawn from our data. Furthermore, we found that among these SNAREs, only syntaxin 7 adopts a closed conformation, which is corroborated by the fact that only the presence of the syntaxin 7 N-terminal domain retards assembly of the endosomal SNARE complex.A three-helix bundle N-terminal domain has been found in all syntaxins whose domain structures have been analyzed in detail, including the neuronal syntaxin 1 (17Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and the yeast Sso1p (21Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), Vam3p (26Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and Sed5p (27Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I. Min S.W. Chen X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the presence of such a domain is generally difficult to establish from sequence analysis alone due to high divergence in this region among syntaxins that function in different cellular compartments. In addition, the length of the helices varies from one syntaxin to another (e.g. ∼35 residues for syntaxin 1 versus ∼26 residues for Vam3p), and prolines are sometimes found in the middle of the helices (26Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which further hinders the reliable prediction of the location of the helices. Syntaxin 7 is a “true” syntaxin (a Qa-SNARE, (9Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar)) and represents the sixth protein in this SNARE subclass whose N-terminal domain forms a three-helix bundle. Thus, this result further reinforces the notion that all syntaxins contain this domain.Surprisingly, the N terminus of the SNAP-25 relative vti1b (a Qb-SNARE) is also represented by a three-helical bundle. This is the first SNARE found to contain this type of domain outside the syntaxin family, and sequence alignments suggest that this structure is conserved throughout evolution among the members of the vti1-subfamily. The observation that a non-syntaxin SNARE also contains an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal three-helix bundle suggests that this is a predominant structure in SNARE N-terminal domains not restricted to a particular subfamily.Although structurally conserved, there is so far no coherent picture concerning the molecular interactions of the N-terminal three-helix bundles. When the free cytoplasmic domains are studied, Sso1p, syntaxin 1, and syntaxin 7 are also closed, whereas Vam3p and vti1b are open. The prevalence of a closed conformation correlates with the retardation of SNARE assembly, both in solution assembly and in liposome fusion assays. Syntaxin 7 is the first syntaxin adopting a closed conformation that does not function at the plasma membrane. Therefore our data show that a closed conformation is not a special feature of exocytotic syntaxins.It remains unclear to which extent Sec1/Munc-18 proteins regulate the equilibrium between open and closed conformations. Binding of Munc-18 to neuronal syntaxin 1 comprises the best studied example. In this case, binding locks syntaxin in the closed conformation and prevents its interaction with other SNAREs (19Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 21Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 39Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Conversely, Munc-18 does not bind to the assembled synaptic SNARE complex. In contrast, the yeast homologue Sec1p does not bind to isolated Sso1p but rather to the assembled SNARE complex of Sso1/2p, Sec9p, and Snc1/2p (32Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).Despite this apparent variability in the interactions involving SNARE N-terminal domains, it is becoming apparent that these domains are crucial for function. For instance, in Caenorhabditis elegans, syntaxin mutants that are locked in the open configuration can compensate for a loss of the presynaptic protein Unc13, whereas wild-type syntaxin is inefficient (40Richmond J.E. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal domain of Sso1p is required for cell viability (21Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, more work is required to determine whether these N-terminal domains perform a common function in most SNAREs or whether they represent functionally heterogeneous adaptive modules that act at different stages of the SNARE conformational and functional cycles. The presence of differently structured N termini in some SNAREs supports the idea that SNAREs are modular proteins, with the SNARE motif being the structurally and functionally common denominator, whereas the N-terminal domains suit specific needs of individual SNAREs. In this context, it should be noted that the yeast SNAP-25 homologue Sec9p possesses a much larger N-terminal domain of unknown structure that, however, appears to be functionally expendable (41Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keranen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Similarly, the neuron-specific soluble R-SNARE tomosyn possesses an N-terminal domain of unknown function that is 10 times the size of the SNARE motif. Except for Sec1/Munc-18 proteins and the adjacent SNARE motifs, no ligands are known for any of these domains. Undoubtedly, further research will be required to unravel common denominators and specific features of the N-terminal domains of SNARE proteins, and additional twists and turns are likely to appear in this research. SNARE1 proteins play an essential role in all membrane fusion steps of the secretory and endocytic pathway (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 2Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). They represent a superfamily of small membrane proteins that are distinguished by a conserved stretch of ∼60 amino acids, referred to as the SNARE motif (3Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most SNAREs possess a membrane anchor domain that is localized C-terminal of the SNARE motif. As monomers, SNARE motifs are unstructured (4Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 5Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). When appropriate sets of SNARE motifs are mixed, they spontaneously assemble into tight bundles of α-helices, a reaction that is thought to tie membranes together and to initiate fusion. After fusion, SNARE complexes are disassembled by the chaperone-like ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor in conjunction with cofactors, thus reactivating the SNAREs for another round of membrane fusion (6Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Since assembly and disassembly of SNARE motifs is essential for fusion, major efforts have been made to understand these reactions in detail. From these studies, a few principles have emerged that appear to be valid for all SNAREs. First, SNARE complexes are represented by elongated four-helix bundles whose structure is remarkably conserved despite considerable sequence heterogeneity (7Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 8Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Each helix is contributed by a different SNARE motif, and each motif occupies a unique position in the four-helix bundle (9Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In the middle of the bundle is a highly conserved layer of four interacting polar side chains (three glutamines and one arginine), each contributed by one of the SNARE motifs. These observations led to their classification into Q- and R-SNAREs (7Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Second, different SNAREs can be substituted for each other to a certain extent as long as they occupy equivalent positions (11Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 12Yang B. Gonzalez Jr., L. Prekeris R. Steegmaier M. Advani R.J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Third, assembly occurs spontaneously and is associated with the release of considerable amounts of energy (5Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennett M.K. J.

Indeed, liposome reconstitution experiments indicate that spontaneous assembly suffices to drive membrane fusion without the need for additional factors or for energy (16Weber T. Zemelman B.V.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8470-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that interacts intramolecularly with the SNARE motif, resulting in an equilibrium between a “closed” and an “open” conformation (19Dulubova I.

On the other hand, Munc18–1, a protein of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family, binds tightly to the closed conformation of syntaxin 1 and stabilizes it (19Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I.

Thus, Munc-18–1 may serve as a negative regulator that prevents syntaxin from forming SNARE complexes, although undoubtedly it has an essential role in exocytosis (25Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J.

In Sso1p, the domain binds to the SNARE motif even more tightly than in syntaxin 1 (22Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In contrast, no such binding was observed in Vam3p (26Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This difference may be explained by the fact that a surface groove that binds to the SNARE motif in Sso1p and syntaxin 1 is lacking in the Vam3p three-helix bundle. Of the N-terminal domains with different folds, that of Sec22b does not have an influence on the rate of SNARE assembly in vitro (30Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Weis W.I. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24203-24211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ykt6p adopts a closed conformation that retards SNARE complex assembly (31Tochio H. Tsui M.M. Banfield D.K. Zhang M. Science. 2001; 293: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Third, the SM protein Sec1p does not bind to the closed conformation of Sso1p but rather to SNARE complexes containing Sso1p (32Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, the yeast syntaxins Sed5p and Ufe1p have recently been shown to bind to their corresponding SM protein, Sly1p, via a short peptide motif at the very N terminus of their sequence outside the three-helix bundle (27Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I. Min S.W. Chen X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Previously, we have characterized a SNARE complex that mediates fusion of late endosomes (8Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Unlike the synaptic SNARE complex, in which only syntaxin 1 contains a large N-terminal region, three of the four SNAREs of the endosomal complex contain long N-terminal regions (syntaxin 7, vti1b, and syntaxin 8). In this study, we have determined whether these three SNAREs contain three-helix bundles in their N-terminal regions or include domains with different folds. Furthermore, we investigated whether the N-terminal domain of any of these SNAREs interacts with the SNARE motif and whether the presence of the N-terminal domain affects the rate of SNARE complex formation. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have analyzed the N-terminal regions of the endosomal SNAREs syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, and vti1b using biophysical techniques. All three regions contain well folded α-helical domains. In syntaxin 7 and vti1b, they constitute three-helix bundles similar to those determined previously for syntaxin1, Sso1p, and Vam3p. For the N-terminal domain of syntaxin 8, a similar fold is likely, but no certain conclusion can be drawn from our data. Furthermore, we found that among these SNAREs, only syntaxin 7 adopts a closed conformation, which is corroborated by the fact that only the presence of the syntaxin 7 N-terminal domain retards assembly of the endosomal SNARE complex.A three-helix bundle N-terminal domain has been found in all syntaxins whose domain structures have been analyzed in detail, including the neuronal syntaxin 1 (17Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and the yeast Sso1p (21Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), Vam3p (26Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and Sed5p (27Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I. Min S.W. Chen X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the presence of such a domain is generally difficult to establish from sequence analysis alone due to high divergence in this region among syntaxins that function in different cellular compartments. In addition, the length of the helices varies from one syntaxin to another (e.g. ∼35 residues for syntaxin 1 versus ∼26 residues for Vam3p), and prolines are sometimes found in the middle of the helices (26Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which further hinders the reliable prediction of the location of the helices. Syntaxin 7 is a “true” syntaxin (a Qa-SNARE, (9Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar)) and represents the sixth protein in this SNARE subclass whose N-terminal domain forms a three-helix bundle. Thus, this result further reinforces the notion that all syntaxins contain this domain.Surprisingly, the N terminus of the SNAP-25 relative vti1b (a Qb-SNARE) is also represented by a three-helical bundle. This is the first SNARE found to contain this type of domain outside the syntaxin family, and sequence alignments suggest that this structure is conserved throughout evolution among the members of the vti1-subfamily. The observation that a non-syntaxin SNARE also contains an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal three-helix bundle suggests that this is a predominant structure in SNARE N-terminal domains not restricted to a particular subfamily.Although structurally conserved, there is so far no coherent picture concerning the molecular interactions of the N-terminal three-helix bundles. When the free cytoplasmic domains are studied, Sso1p, syntaxin 1, and syntaxin 7 are also closed, whereas Vam3p and vti1b are open. The prevalence of a closed conformation correlates with the retardation of SNARE assembly, both in solution assembly and in liposome fusion assays. Syntaxin 7 is the first syntaxin adopting a closed conformation that does not function at the plasma membrane. Therefore our data show that a closed conformation is not a special feature of exocytotic syntaxins.It remains unclear to which extent Sec1/Munc-18 proteins regulate the equilibrium between open and closed conformations. Binding of Munc-18 to neuronal syntaxin 1 comprises the best studied example. In this case, binding locks syntaxin in the closed conformation and prevents its interaction with other SNAREs (19Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 21Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 39Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Conversely, Munc-18 does not bind to the assembled synaptic SNARE complex. In contrast, the yeast homologue Sec1p does not bind to isolated Sso1p but rather to the assembled SNARE complex of Sso1/2p, Sec9p, and Snc1/2p (32Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).Despite this apparent variability in the interactions involving SNARE N-terminal domains, it is becoming apparent that these domains are crucial for function. For instance, in Caenorhabditis elegans, syntaxin mutants that are locked in the open configuration can compensate for a loss of the presynaptic protein Unc13, whereas wild-type syntaxin is inefficient (40Richmond J.E. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal domain of Sso1p is required for cell viability (21Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, more work is required to determine whether these N-terminal domains perform a common function in most SNAREs or whether they represent functionally heterogeneous adaptive modules that act at different stages of the SNARE conformational and functional cycles. The presence of differently structured N termini in some SNAREs supports the idea that SNAREs are modular proteins, with the SNARE motif being the structurally and functionally common denominator, whereas the N-terminal domains suit specific needs of individual SNAREs. In this context, it should be noted that the yeast SNAP-25 homologue Sec9p possesses a much larger N-terminal domain of unknown structure that, however, appears to be functionally expendable (41Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keranen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Similarly, the neuron-specific soluble R-SNARE tomosyn possesses an N-terminal domain of unknown function that is 10 times the size of the SNARE motif. Except for Sec1/Munc-18 proteins and the adjacent SNARE motifs, no ligands are known for any of these domains. Undoubtedly, further research will be required to unravel common denominators and specific features of the N-terminal domains of SNARE proteins, and additional twists and turns are likely to appear in this research. In the present study, we have analyzed the N-terminal regions of the endosomal SNAREs syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, and vti1b using biophysical techniques.

https://openalex.org/W1990723450,"We reported previously that the F87W/Y96F/V247L mutant of cytochrome P-450cam (CYP101) fromPseudomonas putida catalyzed the rapid oxidation of lightly chlorinated benzenes, but pentachlorobenzene oxidation was slow (Jones, J. P., O'Hare, E. J., and Wong, L. L. (2001) Eur. J. Biochem. 268, 1460–1467). In the present work, we determined the crystal structure of this mutant with bound 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene. The substrate was bound to crystallographically independent CYP101 molecules in at least three different orientations, which were distinguished by the angle between the benzene ring and the porphyrin, and one orientation contained an Fe-Cl interaction. In another orientation, the substrate was almost parallel to the heme, with a C–H bond closest to the iron. The enzyme/substrate contacts suggested that the L244A mutation should promote the binding of pentachlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene by creating space to accommodate the extra chlorines. The F87W/Y96F/L244A/V247L mutant thus designed was found to oxidize pentachlorobenzene at a rate of 82.5 nmol (nmol CYP101)−1 min−1, 45 times faster than the F87W/Y96F/V247L parent mutant. The rate of hexachlorobenzene oxidation was increased 200-fold, to 2.0 min−1. Both substrates are oxidized to pentachlorophenol, which is degraded by micro-organisms. In principle, the F87W/Y96F/L244A/V247L mutant could have applications in the bioremediation of polychlorinated benzenes.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10019-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2). These reactions are important in biosynthesis, biochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical medicine. A great deal of research effort has been directed at understanding the relationship between structure, function, and reactivity (2) and to engineer these enzymes for biotechnological applications (3Kellner D.G. Maves S.A. Sligar S.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Wong L.L. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Acta. 2000; 1543: 383-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Polychlorinated aromatic compounds are hazardous and recalcitrant environmental contaminants and, as such, are classified as priority pollutants by the environment agencies of the United States and Europe (6Robinson G.K. Lenn M.J. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 1994; 12: 139-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Fetzner S. Lingens F. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 641-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the less chlorinated benzenes, biphenyls (polychlorinated biphenyls), and dioxins can be degraded by a consortium of micro-organisms (8Beil S. Happe B. Timmis K.N. Pieper D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Potrawfke T. Timmis K.N. Wittich R.M. Appl. Environ.

However, as the degree of chlorination increases, the compounds become more inert, and the heavily chlorinated homologues are partially degraded at slow rates or not at all. For example, pentachlorobenzene (PeCB)1 and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) are highly recalcitrant (11Neilson A.H. Int. Biodeter. Biodeg. 1996; 38: 3-21Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Aerobic micro-organisms degrade chlorinated aromatic compounds via initial attack by nonheme iron dioxygenases to form thecis-dihydrodiol. After re-aromatization to chlorocatechols, catechol 1,2-dioxygenases (another class of nonheme iron enzymes) cleave the aromatic ring (7Fetzner S. Lingens F. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 641-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Haigler B.E. Nishino S.F. Spain J.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 294-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these dioxygenases appear to require certain ring positions to remain unsubstituted (12Marinucci A.C. Bartha R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 38: 811-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Broderick J.B. O'Halloran T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7349-7358Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Feidieker D. Kaempfer P. Dott W. FEMS Mic. Ec. 1994; 15: 265-278Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and no strictly aerobic organism capable of degrading PeCB, HCB, and the heavily chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins has been isolated. Instead, these compounds are degraded by much slower reductive pathways (7Fetzner S. Lingens F. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 641-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the benzenes, polychlorinated phenols are readily mineralized by micro-organisms (15Solyanikova I.P. Golovleva L.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 64: 365-372PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation pathways for heavily chlorinated phenols typically involve oxidation to chlorohydroquinones catalyzed by flavin-dependent monooxygenases (16Orser C.S. Lange C.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Lee S.G. Yoon B.D. Park Y.H. Oh H.M. J. Appl.

The reactive chlorohydroquinones are then dehalogenated by hydrolytic or reductive mechanisms. We have proposed that chlorophenol degrading micro-organisms could be genetically augmented with monooxygenase enzymes that can convert chlorinated benzenes to the phenol derivatives (20Jones J.P. O'Hare E.J. Wong L.L. Chem. Commun. 2000; : 247-248Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Jones J.P. O'Hare E.J. Wong L.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Provided that the introduced enzyme could oxidize the heavily chlorinated benzenes to the phenol derivatives at significant rates, the novel micro-organisms thus generated could degrade all chlorinated benzenes (Fig. 1). We showed recently that the heme monooxygenase CYP101 fromPseudomonas putida (22Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 23Mueller E.J.

The triple mutant F87W/Y96F/V247L oxidized 1,3,5-trichlororbenzene (1,3,5-TCB) with a catalytic turnover rate of 175 min−1 and 57% coupling; this activity is more than sufficient for the application of this mutant in the bioremediation of the recalcitrant 1,3,5-TCB. This mutant also showed a fast NADH oxidation rate with PeCB as the substrate, but the PeCB oxidation rate was slow because of extensive uncoupling (21Jones J.P. O'Hare E.J. Wong L.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we were encouraged by the NADH turnover rate because this indicated that the PeCB was bound within the CYP101 active site, although not in the correct orientation to suppress uncoupling side reactions. We report here our efforts to gain further insight into CYP101 substrate specificity and to improve the activity and coupling efficiency for the oxidation of PeCB and HCB by engineered CYP101 mutants. We determined the crystal structure of the F87W/Y96F/V247L mutant of CYP101 with 1,3,5-TCB bound within the active site. The structure provided new information on CYP101 substrate recognition and indicated an additional mutation that greatly increased the PeCB and HCB oxidation activity. Enzymes for molecular biology were from New England Biolabs. Buffer components were from Anachem, and general reagents were from Sigma or Merck. NADH was from Roche Diagnostics. 1,3,5-TCB, PeCB, HCB, and PCP were from Sigma. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Varian CARY 1E spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier cell temperature controller (± 0.1 °C). The HPLC analyses were performed on a Gilson system. General DNA and microbiological manipulations were carried out by standard methods (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The CYP101 enzyme and the physiological electron transfer co-factor proteins putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified following literature methods (25Westlake A.C. Harford-Cross C.F. Donovan J. Wong L.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Peterson J.A. Lorence M.C. Amarneh B. J. Biol.

Acta. 1994; 1204: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were stored at −20 °C in buffers containing 50% glycerol. Immediately before use in activity assays, glycerol was removed by gel filtration on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), eluting with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. All of the CYP101 enzymes described in this work also contained the C334A mutation to prevent protein dimerization via disulfide bond formation (28Nickerson D.P. Wong L.-L. Prot. Engng. 1997; 10: 1357-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For convenience, the C334A base mutant is referred to as “wild type,” and the Y96F/C334A double mutant is referred to as Y96F, etc. The mutants Y96F, F87W/Y96F, and F87W/Y96F/V247L had been prepared previously (21Jones J.P. O'Hare E.J. Wong L.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides (and their reverse complements) were used on the F87W/Y96F mutant gene to generate the new mutants (target codons underlined): F87W/Y96F/L244A, 5′-AAGAGGATGTGTGGCGCGTTACTGGTCGGCGGC-3′; F87W/Y96F/V247A, 5′-TGTGGCCTGTTACTGGCGGGCGGCCTGGATACG-3′; and F87W/Y96F/L244A/V247L, 5′-AGGATGTGTGGCGCGTTACTGCTCGGCGGCCTGGAT-3′. The mutants were identified and fully sequenced by automated DNA sequencing on an ABI 377XL Prism DNA sequencer by the DNA sequencing facility at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford. Crystals of the F87W/Y96F/V247L mutant were obtained at 291 K by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Immediately prior to crystallization the mutant was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) column (16 mm inner diameter × 80 cm), eluting with 40 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm camphor, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 200 mm KCl at a flow rate of 0.8 ml min−1. The protein was buffer exchanged into 100 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5, 200 mm KCl, and concentrated to 8 mg ml−1 by ultrafiltration. A 1-μl aliquot of this solution was mixed with 1 μl of 30% PEG8000 in buffer A (100 mm cacodylate, 200 mm sodium acetate) and suspended over 1 ml of 18–24% PEG8000 in buffer A. Diffraction quality crystals of CYP101 appeared within 24 h. The crystals were transferred using a fiber loop and soaked in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 100 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm KCl, 20% PEG8000, and 100 μm1,3,5-TCB (added as a 100 mm stock in ethanol) for 5 days. Immediately prior to data collection, the crystals were soaked in a cryoprotecting solution consisting of 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm sodium acetate, 20% glycerol, and 20% PEG8000 and flash frozen at 100 K in a stream of nitrogen gas. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a MAR345 image plate using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) from an in-house Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 48 kV and 98 mA. The crystals belonged to the space group P1, with unit cell dimensions a = 62.47, b = 66.90,c = 95.54 Å, α = 89.72o, β = γ = 90o. A total of 285817 reflections were measured, with an R merge of 7.9% for 74790 unique reflections and 95.8% completeness (50 – 2.2 Å). The data were collected to 90.1% completeness in the highest resolution shell. The structure was solved by molecular replacement, based on the crystal structure of wild type CYP101 with bound camphor (Protein Data Bank code 2CPP). In the crystal of the mutant, although the three angles of the unit cell are all virtually 90°, the R sysvalue for an orthorhombic system was considerably higher than that for a monoclinic cell. More importantly, extensive molecular replacement was attempted in all possible orthorhombic space groups without any success. Hence, prior to soaking of the substrate, the mutant was determined to be of the P21 space group where we were able to find two molecular replacement solutions corresponding to the two molecules/asymmetric unit. The P21 space group was also found in a similar study (29Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). However, when these solutions were used for the complex structure resulting from the soaking experiments, we were not able to refine the structure of the complex in the P21 space group. After realizing that a breakdown of symmetry may have occurred because of soaking and entry of the substrate, we switched to the P1 space group where we placed the additional two molecules in P1 viaP21 symmetry operations. As a result, the refinement proceeded smoothly. No noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were applied to the four protein molecules in theP1 cell. As evident in the difference Fourier map, two molecules (A and B) showed clear electron density above the heme group, which could be readily modeled as 1,3,5-TCB. Difference density in molecule C was sufficiently strong to accommodate the substrate, although its orientation was somewhat ambiguous. In contrast, the density near the heme group of the fourth molecule (D) was rather weak and too small for 1,3,5-TCB to be fitted. Despite the fact that the weak density could represent a weakly bound substrate with very low occupancy, in the final structure it was more reasonable to model the density as a cluster of three water molecules. The final refinement parameters were R work = 18.6% andR free = 25.8%.

Open table in a new tab All of the incubations were carried out at 30 °C. Incubation mixtures (1.7 ml) contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 1 μmCYP101, 10 μm putidaredoxin, 1 μmputidaredoxin reductase, and 30 μg ml−1 bovine catalase (30Stevenson J.-A. Westlake A.C.G. Whittock C. Wong L.-L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12846-12847Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mixtures were oxygenated and then equilibrated at 30 °C for 2 min. The PeCB and HCB substrates were added as 10 mmstocks in Me2SO to a nominal final concentration in an incubation mixture of 100 μm. Precipitation of both substrates was observed. NADH was added to ∼160 μm(final A 340 = 1.00), and the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored. In the case of the F87W/Y96F/L244A/V247L mutant, the absorbance at 340 nm did not drop to 0 because the mutant produced appreciable amounts of the PCP product, which had an absorption maximum at 325 nm. However, this did not interfere with the determination of the rate of NADH consumption, which was calculated from the slope of the time-course plot using ε340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. The maximum concentration of Me2SO in an incubation reaction was 0.2% (v/v), and control experiments showed that Me2SO at 2% (v/v) did not induce any changes in the heme spin state equilibrium nor increases in the rate of NADH consumption. After all of the NADH had been consumed in an incubation reaction, 2-naphthol was added to the mixture to act as an internal standard for the solid phase extraction and HPLC analysis steps. Organics in the mixtures were adsorbed onto a Varian Bond-Elut C18 column (1 ml of matrix volume) that had been equilibrated by washing with 1 ml of methanol followed by 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and dried under vacuum for 5 min. The bound organics were eluted with 1 ml of acetonitrile. The polychlorinated benzenes and their metabolites were separated by reverse phase HPLC using acetonitrile/water, pH 3.0, gradients developed on a C18 column (2.5 mm inner diameter × 250 mm). The flow rate was 1 ml min−1, and the eluent was monitored at 220 nm. A 450-μl aliquot of the acetonitrile eluent from the Bond-Elut column was mixed with 550 μl of water, pH 3.0, and 100 μl of the mixture (45% v/v acetonitrile in water) was injected onto the column. The acetonitrile concentration was increased from 45 to 75% over 10 min and then maintained at 75% for 8 min. The retention time of the PCP product was 16.5 min. The PCP concentration in incubation mixtures was calculated by calibrating the concentration response of the HPLC detector to this compound. Mixtures containing different concentrations of PCP and all of the components of a normal incubation, except NADH and substrate, were extracted and analyzed as for normal incubations. The plot of the ratio of the peak area for PCP to the 2-naphthol internal standard against the PCP concentration gave a calibration plot from which the absolute concentration of PCP produced by enzymatic turnover in an incubation mixture could be determined. The coupling efficiency was the percentage of NADH consumed that lead to PCP formation. We found that the results of PCP analysis were more variable than for the less chlorinated analogues we had studied earlier (20Jones J.P. O'Hare E.J. Wong L.L. Chem. Commun. 2000; : 247-248Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Jones J.P. O'Hare E.J. Wong L.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This was true even for the calibration experiments carried out at different times, and the variations increased with increasing PCP concentration. The problem was particularly acute for the F87W/Y96F/L244A/V247L mutant, which had the highest coupling efficiency, with some early analyses indicating erroneously high couplings. The reasons for the variability were not clear, but consistent results were eventually obtained by carrying out calibration controls in parallel with incubation assays at concentrations above and below the PCP concentration expected from enzymatic substrate oxidation. The CYP101 mutant F87W/Y96F/V247L was crystallized from cacodylate buffer and PEG8000. Soaking the crystals in the well solution with 100 μm 1,3,5-TCB added did not give good quality crystals. The conditions were varied, and we found that soaking in MES buffer for 5 days gave the best results. Longer soak times resulted in deterioration of the crystals and lower data resolution. The crystals of the F87W/Y96F/V247L mutant with 1,3,5-TCB bound in the active site diffracted to beyond 2.0 Å resolution, and the structure at 2.2 Å resolution was solved by molecular replacement methods. There were four protein molecules (A, B, C, and D) in the unit cell, three of which (A, B, and C) contained the 1,3,5-TCB substrate within the active site, whereas only water molecules were modeled in the substrate pocket in molecule D. The 1,3,5-TCB substrate was bound in different orientations in molecules A, B, and C. We also obtained another crystal form under similar crystallization conditions. These crystals belonged to the space groupP21, with two enzyme molecules in each unit cell. One molecule was the substrate-free form, whereas the other had a 1,3,5-TCB substrate bound in a very similar orientation to that found in molecule A of the monoclinic crystals. However, thisP21 form diffracted only to 2.5 Å resolution, and further refinement was not pursued. The electron density of the first 9 amino acid residues was not observed in any of the four molecules in the unit cell, otherwise the mutant retained all of the structural features of the wild type (31Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Some general structural parameters for the mutant molecules are compared with those for the wild type in TableI. The Cα backbones of all four molecules were almost superimposable on that of the wild type. The heme was ruffled, and the iron atom was out of the porphyrin ring and toward the sulfur of the proximal cysteine. Potassium was found at the proposed cation-binding site near the protein surface on the distal side of the heme (31Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Protein-heme contacts such as those between the side chains of Arg112, His355, and Asp297, and the heme propionate groups were present. The Thr101 side chain in our monoclinic crystals was rotated by ∼90o compared with the orthorhombic crystal form of the wild type (31Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), with the OH group forming a hydrogen bond with the propionate group of pyrrole D. This change in side chain orientation had been observed previously in the structure of a similarly monoclinic form of the wild type crystallized from Tris buffer and PEG4000 (29Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). However, in both monoclinic forms there was little effect on the conformation of other side chains. The planes of the aromatic side chains at the 87 and 96 positions in the wild type and all four molecules of the mutant were virtually superimposable, although the main chain and side chain of the 87 residue were shifted by ∼0.4 Å. Similar slight shifts were also observed for the 247 residue. The Phe98 phenyl ring was rotated by ∼20o in all four molecules, apparently to avoid steric hindrance between Phe98 CE and Leu247 CD. The indole NH group of Trp87pointed toward the heme, whereas the benzene ring was oriented toward the Leu247 side chain. The orientation of the geminal methyl groups of Leu247 varied slightly in the four protein molecules, but in all cases the closest distance between the Trp87 and Leu247 side chains was 4.0–4.3 Å, compared with 6.5 Å between Phe87 and Val247in the wild type. It is evident that the three mutations had only minor effects on the structure of CYP101. Poulos et al. (31Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) noted previously that the structure of CYP101 does not show an obvious substrate access channel, and dynamic fluctuations are required to allow entry of a potential substrate. The close position of the Trp87 and Leu247 side chains at the top of the CYP101 active site indicates that the structural fluctuations are sufficient to move both of these sterically demanding side chains out of the way, such that an incoming substrate,e.g. 1,3,5-TCB, can enter and bind in the active site. The active site structure of molecule A with 1,3,5-TCB bound, together with the electron density for the substrate, is shown in Fig. 2. (The contact distances between 1,3,5-TCB and the heme and protein side chains are detailed in the supplemental table. There were no water molecules in the active site.) The substrate was located mainly over pyrroles A and D and the meso carbons CHA and CHB. The C-4 atom of 1,3,5-TCB was at a distance of 4.01 Å above the heme iron with a C/Fe/S (Cys357) angle of 170°, compared with 4.21 Å and 164° for camphor C-5 in the wild type structure. The angle between the 1,3,5-TCB plane and the porphyrin was 28°, and these two aromatic systems were in van der Waals' contact. The heme and 1,3,5-TCB chlorine atoms played very important roles in the enzyme-substrate interactions. There was strong van der Waals' interaction between Cl-3 and pyrrole D. Cl-5 was close to themeso carbon CHB, and it also contacted the Val295 side chain (Fig. 3). Both Cl-3 and C-2 contacted the Leu244 side chain, and Cl-3 also contacted the backbone of Gly248. The Cl-1 atom was 3.00 Å away from the indole nitrogen of Trp87, indicating a hydrogen bonding interaction. This chlorine atom was also within hydrogen bonding distance (3.40 Å) of a carboxylate oxygen of Asp297. The hydrogen bond to the indole NH of Trp87 appeared to pull the Cl-1/C-1 end of the 1,3,5-TCB molecule slightly upwards and tilt the plane of the ring away from being parallel to the porphyrin. The substrate binding orientation in molecule A, with the benzene ring almost parallel to and in van der Waals' contact with the porphyrin ring might be considered to be very favorable for both 1,3,5-TCB binding and oxidation. The substrate is close to the heme, preventing access of water to the iron atom during the catalytic cycle. The substrate C-4 atom is poised over the iron atom, at a comparable distance to camphor C-5 in the wild type, and so efficient attack by the ferryl intermediate is expected. The predicted product would be 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, as observed experimentally. The 1,3,5-TCB binding orientation in molecule B and the electron density for the substrate are shown in Fig. 4. As observed with molecule A, there were no water molecules in the active site. The substrate binding orientation in molecule B was related to that in molecule A by a tilt of the plane of the benzene about the C-4 atom, increasing the angle between the ring and the porphyrin from 28 to 66°. The Cl-3, C-4, and Cl-5 atoms remained over pyrrole D and the CHB meso carbon, but all three atoms moved closer to the heme, resulting in more substrate/heme contacts. The Cl-1 atom moved away from the pyrrole NH (3.80 Å versus 3.04 Å) and toward the benzene CZ2 and CH2 atoms of the Trp87 indole side chain and into contact with CG of the Leu247 side chain. The ring tilt also brought"

Frigeri P. Paci M. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5514-5521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic studies of native and nicked enzymatic species together with protection experiments against limited proteolysis of DDC by various substrates have suggested that ligand conformational changes occur at or near the tryptic cleavage region (1Bertoldi M. Frigeri P. Paci M. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5514-5521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The finding that recombinant rat liver DDC lacking this loop is incompetent for decarboxylation supports this view (7Ishii S. Hayashi H. Okamoto A. Kagamiyama H. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The spatial structure of ligand-free DDC and its complex with the anti-Parkinson drug carbiDopa has been recently solved, but the flexible loop between residues 328 and 339 is invisible in the electron density map (8Burkhard P. Dominici P. Borri Voltattorni C. Jansonius J.N. Malashkevich V.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A model based on the coordinates of the enzyme with the flexible loop in its hypothetical open form was built. Although in this modeled structure the loop is located at the dimer interface, far away from the active site, it is expected to extend toward the active site of the other monomer in a closed conformation upon substrate binding. Such loop closure could be an essential step in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, and it is also reasonable to suppose that some loop residues could even take part in the catalytic mechanism. Fig.1 shows a tentative model of the flexible loop in a position to gate access to the active site in the DDC-carbiDopa complex. The tyrosyl residue, Tyr-332, in the model is found 3.86 Å from the α-carbon of the ligand. This residue is of particular interest as it is conserved in PLP-dependent group II α-decarboxylases (9Ishii S. Mizuguchi H. Nishino J. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to investigate the role of Tyr-332 in the mobile loop of DDC. l-Dopa, l- andd-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), dopamine, PLP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP), NADH, bovine liver l-glutamate dehydrogenase, horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, and Hepes were Sigma products. The liquid chromatography solvents (HPLC grade) were from Labscan. Ingredients for bacterial growth were from Difco. Oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen. PCR amplifications were performed using the Expand high fidelity PCR system commercialized by Stratagene. The restriction enzymes used for cloning were from Biolabs. d,l-[1-14C]Dopa (55 mCi/mmol) was a product of ICN Pharmaceuticals. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension PCR (10Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Snisky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). This method uses four oligonucleotide primers in three separate PCR reactions to introduce a mutation into the target DNA sequence. Two separate PCR reactions are run, one using primers 1 and 3 to amplify a portion of the target sequence and the other using primers 2 and 4 to amplify the other portion. A short section of DNA has identical sequence in both PCR products and corresponds to the sequence of primers 2 and 3 (“internal primers”), which are complementary to each other and carry the “mismatch,” i.e. the mutation. In the third PCR, the purified products of the previous two reactions are employed as template. Following denaturation, a small fraction of the template DNA will anneal to form heteroduplexes and will be extended at its recessed 3′ ends by the polymerase used in the reaction. The full-length sequence containing the mutation is then amplified using primers 1 and 4 (“external primers”). This mutant was produced using as external primers 5′-ATCGGCTCGTATAATGTGTGG-3′ and 5′-GTTCTGATTTAATCTGTATCAGG-3′. Internal primers were 5′-GACCCCGTGTTCTTAAAGCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGCTTTAAGAACACGGGGTC-3′. The newly inserted part of the expression construct, pKKDDC-mutant, was sequenced to confirm mutation, and the plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli SVS370. The conditions used for expression and purification of the mutant protein in E. coli (SVS370) were as described for the wild-type enzyme (2Bertoldi M. Moore P.S. Maras B. Dominici P. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23954-23959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Moore P.S. Dominici P. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since the mutant enzyme does not show detectable decarboxylase activity in the standard spectrophotometric assay, which measures production of aromatic amines, screening with antibodies to native DDC was therefore necessary to monitor the purification procedure. The purified mutant was homogenous as indicated by a single band on SDS-PAGE. The enzyme concentration was determined by using an εM of 1.3 × 105m−1cm−1. PLP content of holoDDC enzymes was determined by releasing the coenzyme in 0.1 m NaOH and by using εM = 6600m−1 cm−1 at 388 nm. A sample of 20 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12.5% acrylamide gel. The proteins were electroblotted to Immobilon-P-membranes (Millipore), and Western blot analysis was performed according to Gallagher et al. (12Gallagher S. Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Hurrel J.G.R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1993: 10.8.1-10.8.17Google Scholar). DDC mutant Y332F (2–5 μm) was incubated with (0.1–5 mm) l-Dopa orl-5-HTP in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at 25 °C in the presence or absence of O2. Production of dopamine or 5-HT was determined with a spectrophotometric assay outlined by Sheraldet al. (13Sherald A.F. Sparrow J.C. Wright T.R.F. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and modified by Charteris and John (14Charteris A. John R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alternatively, production of aromatic amines as well as consumption ofl-aromatic amino acids were measured by HPLC analysis. Aliquots were removed at time intervals, and trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v). The quenched solutions were centrifuged to remove protein, and the supernatants were analyzed using a Discovery (Supelco) C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm). The eluent was methanol:acetic acid:H2O, 24:1:75 with 6 mmoctanesulfonic acid at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Detection was set at 280 nm. The concentration of l-aromatic amino acids and aromatic amines in the analyzed samples was determined from a standard curve generated from known concentrations of the compounds with respect to the internal standard. The amounts of ammonia and aromatic aldehyde (produced during the reaction of the Y332F mutant withl-aromatic amino acids or aromatic amines) were determined using the coupled assays with glutamate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively, as described (2Bertoldi M. Moore P.S. Maras B. Dominici P. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23954-23959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The amount of aldehyde or ammonia was measured by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the conversion of NADH to NAD+. The rate of production of14CO2 during the reaction of mutant with [1-14C]Dopa was determined as described (4Bertoldi M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined with a Beckman Instruments LS 1801 liquid scintillation counter. H2O2 production and O2 consumption were measured according to Refs 1Bertoldi M. Frigeri P. Paci M. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5514-5521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and3Bertoldi M. Dominici P. Moore P.S. Maras B. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6552-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, respectively. The detection and quantification of PLP and PMP content were performed using the HPLC procedure described previously (1Bertoldi M. Frigeri P. Paci M. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5514-5521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Bertoldi M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The apparent pseudo first-order rate constants,k obs, of the reaction of the Y332F mutant at varying concentrations of d-5-HTP were obtained by measuring the decrease of the 425-nm absorbance band as described (1Bertoldi M. Frigeri P. Paci M. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5514-5521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The dependence of k obs on d-5HTP concentrations exhibits a saturation behavior, and a hyperbolic fit gives the value of apparent dissociation constant,K D, and the maximum value of rate constant, kmax. Enzymic assays were performed under anaerobic conditions with 1 ml of Reacti-Vials (Aldrich) as described previously (3Bertoldi M. Dominici P. Moore P.S. Maras B. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6552-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Bertoldi M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded in a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. CD measurements were carried out in a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter at a scan speed of 50 nm/min with a bandwidth of 2 nm. Like the wild type, the mutant binds 2 mol of PLP per dimer. Absorption and CD spectra of the Y332F mutant in the UV-visible and far UV region are essentially identical to those of the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). When the Y332F mutant was incubated at 25 °C under aerobic conditions withl-Dopa, no dopamine formation was detected either by the spectrophotometric or the HPLC assays. However, l-Dopa level decreases, and its decrease parallels the production of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and ammonia accompanied by O2 consumption in a 1:2 molar ratio with respect to the products (Fig. 2). When the reaction was performed under the same experimental conditions in the presence of [1-14C]Dopa, 14CO2 release was observed. The initial velocities of these catalytic events are reported in Table I. Likewise, although no 5-HT production could be detected during the reaction of Y332F withl-5-HTP, conversion of l-5HTP into 5-hydroxyindolacetaldehyde and ammonia as well as consumption of O2 in a 1:2 molar ratio with respect to the products take place with the initial velocity values reported in Table I. During the reaction of Y332F, either with l-Dopa or withl-5-HTP, no detectable H2O2 was found. Initial velocities of oxidase activity, measured asl-aromatic amino acid consumption at varying concentrations of l-Dopa or l-5-HTP, have been determined. Thek cat and K m values are reported in Table II. As for the wild type, upon addition of l-Dopa to Y332F, an increased absorption centered at 425 nm immediately appears. This absorbance band, attributed to the external aldimine, decreases with time, and after the time required for consumption of substrate, the original 425-nm absorbance of the holoenzyme reappears (Fig.3). Qualitatively identical spectral changes are observed upon addition of l-5-HTP to the mutant. When the reaction of Y332F with l-Dopa orl-5-HTP was performed under anaerobic conditions, the concentration of the substrates remained almost unchanged with time, and neither dopamine nor 5-HT were produced. Instead, a conversion of PLP into PMP takes place very quickly: at 30 s, 89% (forl-Dopa) and 55% (for l-5-HTP) of the original coenzyme content are transformed into PMP.Table IInitial velocities of reaction of Y332F mutant (2.4 μm) with 200 μm l-Dopa or l-5-HTPSubstrate or productl-Dopal-5-HTPAromatic amineNot detectedNot detectedl-Aromatic amino acid0.83 ± 0.040.063 ± 0.004Aromatic aldehyde0.72 ± 0.030.053 ± 0.003Ammonia0.75 ± 0.040.055 ± 0.002O20.39 ± 0.010.031 ± 0.00214CO20.82 ± 0.03Not determinedNumbers represent initial velocities expressed as mol/sec/mol enzyme.

The errors reported are the standard error values derived by the curve fitting program. Despite its total impairment of aromatic amines generation, the Y332F mutant retains substantial catalytic competence for the oxidative deamination of aromatic amines. In fact, reaction of the Y332F mutant with 5-HT or dopamine produces the corresponding aromatic aldehyde (5-hydroxyindolacetaldehyde or 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) and ammonia in equivalent amounts and consumes O2. On the other hand, aromatic amines undergo half-transamination under anaerobic conditions with rate constants similar to those of wild type (< 0.1 min−1) (1Bertoldi M. Frigeri P. Paci M. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5514-5521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Bertoldi M. Borri Voltattorni C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1178-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Reaction of d-5-HTP with the mutant results in time-dependent spectral changes consisting of a decrease of the 425-nm absorbance band and a concomitant increase in the 330-nm region. These spectral changes correspond to conversion of PLP-bound to PMP (data not shown). This behavior is identical to that already observed with wild type (1Bertoldi M. Frigeri P. Paci M.

Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined for both oxidative deaminase and half-transaminase activities and reported in Table II. To allow a comparison, the values of the wild-type DDC are also included. The Y332F mutant shows negligible changes from the wild type in thek cat value for oxidative deamination and in the k max of half-transamination but has increased K m values (for aromatic amines) and increased K D values (for d-5-HTP) as compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. Flexible loops that occlude active sites during catalysis are recognized as structural elements common to many enzymes. Loop closure induced by substrate binding has great importance in catalysis and specificity by recruiting functional groups into the active site (15Clarke A. Wigley D.B. Chia W.N. Barstow D.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3879-3886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Kinetic and structural data have indicated that an 11-residue loop in DDC is conformationally dynamic, suggesting that this loop closes over the active site after substrate binding. This study was prompted to gain insights into the function of the mobile residue of this loop, Tyr-332. Replacement of Tyr-332 with phenylalanine results in a protein that is still capable of selectively cleaving the correct bond between Cα and COOH of l-aromatic amino acids. This is supported by the finding that during the reaction of the mutant with l-Dopa in aerobiosis, CO2 is released, and by the occurrence in anaerobiosis of a decarboxylation-dependent transamination of both l-Dopa and l-5-HTP. In fact, PMP formation would be promoted along the reaction pathway if the decarboxylated substrate (quinoid) intermediate is protonated at C4′ instead at Cα. On the basis of these data, it can be anticipated that DDC does not require Tyr-332 for the decarboxylation step. Nevertheless, the Y332F mutant is unable to generate aromatic amines to any discernible extent. Since reprotonation at Cα after decarboxylation is necessary for the generation of aromatic amines (Scheme FS1 (a)), a role for Tyr-332 residue as a proton donor in this reprotonation step can be advanced. However, no accumulation of quinonoid intermediate during the reaction of the Y332F mutant with l-aromatic amino acids can be observed. This would be explained by the fact that, although the original overall decarboxylation of the wild-type enzyme is completely suppressed, a new catalytic activity is generated in the presence of O2. It consists of a decarboxylation-dependent oxidative deamination converting l-aromatic amino acids into CO2, aromatic aldehydes, and ammonia occurring with a consumption of molecular oxygen in a 1:2 molar ratio with respect to the products. An oxidase activity displaying the same stoichiometry has been already reported to be catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme toward aromatic amines (2Bertoldi M. Moore P.S. Maras B. Dominici P. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23954-23959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Bertoldi M. Dominici P. Moore P.S. Maras B. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6552-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Analogous with the already proposed mechanism for the latter reaction (5Bertoldi M. Borri Voltattorni C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1178-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to postulate that decarboxylation-dependent oxidative deamination ofl-aromatic amino acids catalyzed by the Y332F mutant occurs according to the mechanism outlined in Scheme FS1 (b). After release of CO2, binding of O2 to the C4′ of the quinonoid intermediate could lead to the formation of a peroxide anion that, once stabilized by protonation to the hydroperoxyPLP intermediate, will undergo heterolysis of the O–O bond. This allows regeneration of PLP and formation of an imine complex that spontaneously decomposes to aromatic aldehyde and ammonia. According to this mechanism, reaction of Y332F with l-aromatic amino acids does not occur through a serial mechanism in which aromatic amine, produced by decarboxylation, is a transient intermediate that is subsequently converted into aldehyde and ammonia. This is consistent with our data. In fact, the k cat values for oxidative deamination of aromatic amines catalyzed by the Y332F mutant, similar to those catalyzed by the wild-type DDC, are about 150-fold lower than those catalyzed by the mutant toward the correspondingl-aromatic amino acids (Table II). Moreover, reaction of the Y332F mutant with l-aromatic amino acids under anaerobic conditions is characterized by no accumulation of aromatic amine. In an O2-free atmosphere, if the amine were produced, it would accumulate since it would undergo a very slow transamination. Under anaerobic conditions, the C4′of the quinonoid intermediate cannot be oxygenated, but it could be protonated, giving rise to a ketimine substrate intermediate that would yield by hydrolysis the PMP enzyme and the carbonyl compound (Scheme FS1 (c)). This is consistent with our data in the absence of O2. It should be noted that whereas in anaerobiosis for the Y332F mutant, the abortive transamination represents the 100% of the catalytic events, for wild-type DDC, it takes place at a ratio of about once per 5 × 103 and 6.5 × 103 times of decarboxylation for l-Dopa and l-5-HTP, respectively (4Bertoldi M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All together, these results indicate that since the quinonoid intermediate in Y332F cannot undergo protonation at Cα, its only possible fate is oxygenation or protonation at C4′ in the presence or absence, respectively, of O2. Since Tyr-332 likely plays a role as proton donor to Cα along the reaction pathway of decarboxylation, it is not surprising that thek cat value for the oxidative deamination and half-transamination reactions catalyzed by the Y332F mutant toward aromatic amines and d-5-HTP, respectively, remains largely unchanged with respect to the corresponding reactions catalyzed by the wild type. However, the mutant exhibits an ∼10-fold increase in theK m values for amines and in theK D values for d-5-HTP, as compared with those of wild type. The kinetic parameters for the decarboxylation-dependent oxidative deamination indicate that, although replacement of Tyr-332 with phenylalanine led to 10-fold increase in K m value forl-Dopa, the k cat value is similar to that for the overall decarboxylation catalyzed by the wild type for the same substrate. More substantial changes were found whenl-5-HTP was used as substrate (40-fold increase inK m value and ∼2-fold decrease ink cat value for l-5HTP as compared with the wild type) (Table II). Thus, although the catalytic efficiencies of the reactions catalyzed by the Y332F mutant are lower than the corresponding ones for wild type, the major difference is reflected in K m values. This may be due to the fact that Y → F replacement at position 332 weakens the binding of substrates to the enzyme, although not precluding it. The substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine 332 has changed the catalytic properties of DDC toward l-aromatic amino acids: the original overall decarboxylation is completely abolished, and a new catalytic activity not inherent in the wild type is generated. Few site-directed mutagenesis experiments altering the reaction specificity of PLP enzymes have been reported, even if a complete suppression of the original activity has never been achieved (22Vacca R.

It is of interest that replacement of Cys-360 by Ala or Ser in eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase greatly reduces the rate of decarboxylation and increases the rate of the abortive transamination. On this basis, a role for Cys-360 in facilitating decarboxylation has been proposed (24Jackson J.N. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Likewise, mutation of residues in the coenzyme binding pocket of DDC alters the nature of catalysis by enhancing decarboxylation-dependent transamination activity and reducing original decarboxylation activity (25Bertoldi M. Castellani S. Borri Voltattorni C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, such a clear change in reaction specificity of Y332F DDC with a remarkably high new activity (k cat values of 4.6 s−1 and 1.0 s−1 for l-Dopa and l-5HTP, respectively) has as of yet only been reported for papain that was converted into a peptide-nitrite hydratase by a single amino acid substitution at the active site (26Dufour E. Storer A.C. Mènard R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16382-16388Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Strong evidence is provided that loop movement is critical for a correct positioning of Tyr-332 to allow its catalytic role in reprotonation of the quinonoid at Cα. This is the first PLP-α decarboxylase for which the residue responsible for the protonation of the decarboxylated reaction intermediate to form physiological amines has been identified."
https://openalex.org/W1994362859,"A 37-kDa binding polypeptide accumulates in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) extracts from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients and is being considered as a potential diagnostic marker (De Meirleir, K., Bisbal, C., Campine, I., De Becker, P., Salehzada, T., Demettre, E., and Lebleu, B. (2000) Am. J. Med. 108, 99–105). We establish here that this low molecular weight 2-5A-binding polypeptide is a truncated form of the native 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease L (RNase L), generated by an increased proteolytic activity in CFS PBMC extracts. RNase L proteolysis in CFS PBMC extracts can be mimicked in a model system in which recombinant RNase L is treated with human leukocyte elastase. RNase L proteolysis leads to the accumulation of two major fragments with molecular masses of 37 and 30 kDa. The 37-kDa fragment includes the 2-5A binding site and the N-terminal end of native RNase L. The 30-kDa fragment includes the catalytic site in the C-terminal part of RNase L. Interestingly, RNase L remains active and 2-5A-dependent when degraded into its 30- and 37-kDa fragments by proteases of CFS PBMC extract or by purified human leukocyte elastase. The 2-5A-dependent nuclease activity of the truncated RNase L could result from the association of these digestion products, as suggested in pull down experiments.

Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by long-lasting and debilitating fatigue, myalgia, impairment of neurocognitive functions, and flu-like symptoms, which are often severely worsened after physical exercise. A case definition has been proposed by the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta under the name of Holmes (2Holmes G.P. Kaplan J.E. Gantz N.M. Komaroff A.L. Schonberger L.B. Straus S.E. Jones J.F.

Most of these symptoms are unfortunately common to other diseases, thus complicating a diagnosis that still relies on extensive clinical testing to exclude other pathologies (4Komaroff A.L. Buchwald D.S. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A large proportion of the patients report an infectious episode at the onset of their chronic fatigue. No single agent has been conclusively associated with the disease, although several candidates including human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1, human herpesvirus-6,Enterovirus, or mycoplasma have been proposed (5DeFreitas E.

An up-regulation of the 2-5A/RNase L antiviral pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 1The abbreviations used are: PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; CFS, chronic fatigue syndrome; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; HLE, human leukocyte elastase; 2-5A, 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylate; RNase L, 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease L; pCp, cytidine 3′,5′- bisphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; CFS, chronic fatigue syndrome; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; HLE, human leukocyte elastase; 2-5A, 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylate; RNase L, 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease L; pCp, cytidine 3′,5′- bisphosphate. of CFS patients has been described (10Suhadolnik R.J.

Dis. 1994; 18 Suppl. 1: 96-104Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RNase L is the terminal enzyme in the 2-5A synthetase/RNase L antiviral pathway and plays an essential role in the elimination of viral mRNAs (for review, see Ref. 11Bastide L. Demettre E. Martinand-Mari C. Lebleu B. Englebienne P. De Meirleir K. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Biological Approch. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2002: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar). Activation of RNase L requires the binding of a small 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylate (2-5A). Intriguingly, a low molecular weight 2-5A-binding polypeptide has been observed in a subset of patients diagnosed for CFS (12Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. O'Brien K. Cheney P.R. Herst C.V. Reichenbach N.L. Kon N. Horvath S.E. Iacono K.T. Adelson M.E., De Meirleir K., De Becker P. Charubala R. Pfleiderer W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made in a larger study including CFS patients and control groups (1De Meirleir K. Bisbal C. Campine I., De Becker P. Salehzada T. Demettre E. Lebleu B. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 99-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the latter study the presence of a 37-kDa 2-5A-binding polypeptide was found in a significant proportion of the CFS population but absent in most controls, thus providing the basis for a potential biochemical marker of CFS. This low molecular weight 2-5A-binding polypeptide is related to RNase L since it is recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against RNase L (12Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. O'Brien K. Cheney P.R. Herst C.V. Reichenbach N.L. Kon N. Horvath S.E. Iacono K.T. Adelson M.E., De Meirleir K., De Becker P. Charubala R. Pfleiderer W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, an increased nuclease activity has been reported in a subset of CFS patients whose PBMC extracts did not contain any full-size 83-kDa RNase L (13Shetzline S.E. Suhadolnik R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23707-23711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This observation has remained puzzling since the P-loop region (which is responsible for 2-5A binding) and the C-terminal end (which contains the catalytic site of RNase L) are far apart and cannot be fitted within a single 37-kDa polypeptide. In the present study, we establish that an increased proteolytic activity in PBMC extracts from CFS patients is responsible for the accumulation of this truncated form of RNase L and that a 2-5A-dependent nucleolytic activity is maintained in the absence of intact RNase L. Moreover, we demonstrate that proteolysis of RNase L by proteases in CFS PBMC extract or by purified human leukocyte elastase (HLE) gives rise to 2 major fragments with molecular masses of 37 and 30 kDa. The 37-kDa fragment includes the 2-5A binding site and the N-terminal end of full-size RNase L. The 30-kDa fragment starts in the second half of the protein kinase homology domain and includes the catalytic site in the C-terminal part of RNase L. Recombinant RNase L was cloned and expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf21 insect cells by ATG Laboratories (Eden Prairie, MN). A His6 tag was inserted at the N terminus of the protein, which was purified to 90–95% homogeneity by metal chelate chromatography on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose. Venous blood samples were drawn from patients who fulfilled the Holmes (2Holmes G.P. Kaplan J.E. Gantz N.M. Komaroff A.L. Schonberger L.B. Straus S.E. Jones J.F. Dubois R.E. Cunningham-Rundles C.

Med. 1994; 121: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (4102) Google Scholar) criteria for CFS or from healthy individuals. Patients with CFS and healthy individuals were recruited from the Free University of Brussels (Brussels, Belgium) and from the Saint Antoine Hospital (Paris, France). The procedure for isolating PBMC was started within 2 h of sampling. Heparinized whole blood was diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline. Two volumes of diluted blood were overlaid on 1 volume of Ficoll Histopaque® (Sigma-Aldrich) (density of 1.080 g/ml) and centrifuged at 20 °C at 500 × g for 30 min. The PBMC layer was removed, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged. The isolated PBMC pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mm NH4Cl, 10 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA), kept on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged (20 °C, 500 × g, 10 min). The PBMC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged again. The pellets were frozen at −80 °C until use. PBMC from six CFS patients and from three healthy individuals were pooled to create, respectively, CFS PBMC pellets and control PBMC pellets. The cells were resuspended in 2 volumes of hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5% (v/v) ethylphenylpolyethyleneglycol (Nonidet P 40) detergent) by repeated pipetting and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by spectrophotometry (14Whitaker J.R. Granum P.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Chemically synthesized 5′-monophosphorylated 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylate tetramer (2-5A) was generously given by Prof. W. Pfleiderer (University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany). The 2-5A probe was labeled by ligation of [32P]pCp (specific activity, 3,000 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals) to the 3′-terminus of 2-5A with T4 RNA ligase (Amersham Biosciences) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Hypersil ODS 5-μm C18 column. The terminal 3′-phosphate group was removed by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) thanks to its 3′-phosphorylase activity. The pH was adjusted to 4.7, the 3′-ribose residue was oxidized with 10 mm sodium metaperiodate, and the pH was readjusted to 8. The 3′-oxidized 32P-labeled 2-5ApC (2-5A probe) (3,000 Ci/mmol) was incubated with PBMC extract or with recombinant RNase L for 30 min at 4 °C and for a further 30 min at 4 °C with 20 mm NaBH3CN. The polypeptides were fractionated by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and detected by autoradiography. Control or CFS PBMC extracts (50 μg of total proteins) were covalently labeled with the 2-5A probe as described previously. Extracts were incubated with or without 10 mm HLE inhibitor III (Calbiochem) and diluted in Me2SO in 10 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 8 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 90 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm ATP) at 37 °C. At the indicated time, extracts were heated to 95 °C in gel-loading buffer for 3 min. The proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. When HLE inhibitor III was used, a control was added with Me2SO alone to rule out an effect of Me2SO on HLE activity. The recombinant RNase L (250 ng) was covalently labeled with the 2-5A probe and incubated for the indicated time in 10 μl of buffer A at 37 °C with control or CFS PBMC extracts (2.5 μg of total proteins) or with 4 × 10−3 units of HLE (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence or absence of 10 mm HLE inhibitor III. The proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The extract from Daudi lymphoblastoid cells (50 μg of total proteins) was covalently labeled with the 2-5A probe and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of buffer A with HLE. The proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The assay of RNase L nuclease activity was adapted from Carroll et al. (16Carroll S.S. Chen E. Viscount T. Geib J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the RNase L oligonucleotide substrate C11U2C7 (Xeragon) was labeled with [32P]pCp (5 mCi/ml) with T4 RNA ligase (AmershamBiosciences) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 15 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25 μm ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. Recombinant RNase L (400 ng) was digested, or not, by HLE (5 × 10−3 units) or by a low concentration of PBMC CFS extract (200 ng of total proteins) and then incubated with or without 100 nm of 2-5A for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots from this reaction mixture were covalently labeled with the 2-5A probe, and the amounts of 83- and 37-kDa RNase L were quantified after SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography. For measurement of RNase L activity, aliquots of the reaction mixture were supplemented with 37.5 pmol (including 10% of [32P]C11U2C7pCp) of RNase L substrate in 10 μl of buffer A and further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Aliquots were taken again to quantify the amounts of 83- and 37-kDa RNase L after the activity incubation. The cleavage products of [32P]C11U2C7pCp were separated on a 20% (w/v) acrylamide, 7 m urea gel in Tris acetate EDTA and analyzed by autoradiography. Recombinant RNase L (10 μg) were digested, or not, by HLE (0.2 units) or by minute amounts of PBMC CFS extract (5 μg of total proteins) in buffer A. After analysis by SDS-PAGE, proteins were revealed by a zinc stain kit for electrophoresis (Bio-Rad) or transferred by Western blot onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Ponceau red. The major 30- and 37-kDa bands were then excised from the Western blot to be analyzed on a Procise® protein sequencer (Applied Biosystem). Recombinant RNase L (1 μg) was digested, or not, by HLE (0.02 units) or by a low concentration of PBMC CFS extract (0.5 μg of total proteins) in buffer A. After separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the His6-tag of the recombinant RNase L was detected with Ni-NTA horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Qiagen). Recombinant RNase L was incubated overnight at 4 °C with Ni-NTA magnetic-agarose beads (Qiagen) in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. The beads were then washed twice with 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole to eliminate unfixed proteins. An aliquot of RNase L bound to the beads was heated to 95 °C in gel loading buffer for 3 min. The other part (1 μg) was digested by HLE (10−2 units) for 15 min at 30 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice, and heated to 95 °C in gel-loading buffer for 3 min. His6-tagged proteins were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and detected by a zinc stain kit for electrophoresis (Bio-Rad). In our initial studies (1De Meirleir K. Bisbal C. Campine I., De Becker P. Salehzada T. Demettre E. Lebleu B. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 99-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we established that PBMC extracts from CFS patients were characterized by the presence of a low molecular mass (37 kDa) 2-5A-binding polypeptide, whereas an 83-kDa band was predominant in extracts from control PBMC. In these experiments, several protease inhibitors were included at the time of PBMC lysis to limit breakdown of native 83-kDa RNase L during the preparation and the processing of the PBMC extracts. An essential concern was the link between this low molecular mass (37 kDa) 2-5A-binding polypeptide and native RNase L. At this stage, we could not establish whether this 37-kDa 2-5A-binding polypeptide was a new protein, distinct from native RNase L, or was processed from RNase L by proteolysis in intact cells. To discriminate between these two possibilities, PBMC extracts were prepared in the absence of protease inhibitors from healthy individuals or from CFS patients (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) and incubated at 37 °C for increasing periods of time. The 83-kDa RNase L rapidly disappeared upon incubation in PBMC CFS extract, with the concomitant accumulation of a 2-5A probe-labeled band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa (Fig.1B). Additional minor 2-5A probe-labeled polypeptides were detected as well, which probably represent unstable intermediates in the processing of RNase L. In contrast, the 83-kDa RNase L was much more stable in PBMC control extract (Fig.1 A). To further demonstrate an increased proteolytic activity in CFS extracts, recombinant RNase L was covalently labeled with the 2-5A probe and incubated with a low amount of unlabeled control or CFS PBMC extract (Fig. 2). Recombinant RNase L was rapidly converted into a 37-kDa truncated RNase L when incubated with CFS extract and remained essentially stable in the presence of control extract, in keeping with an increased proteolytic activity in the former one. Fingerprint analysis, by limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin or V8 protease, revealed that the 37-kDa band arising from the digestion of the 2-5A probe-labeled recombinant RNase L with CFS extracts gave rise to a proteolytic signature that was identical to that of the 37-kDa-labeled material found in PBMC extracts of CFS patients (data not shown). The biochemical characterization of RNase L degradation products in human PBMC extracts from CFS patients was difficult because of the low abundance of RNase L. We have therefore attempted to degrade recombinant RNase L by purified proteases. To validate this model, degradation of recombinant RNase L by CFS extract was used as control. Preliminary studies have established that several proteases known to be present in PBMC were able to degrade RNase L and to lead to the accumulation of a 37-kDa truncated form (data not shown). HLE appeared particularly interesting in this respect since HLE inhibitor III, a specific peptidic HLE inhibitor, partially inhibited the degradation of endogenous RNase L in PBMC CFS extract (Fig.3). Along the same line, endogenous RNase L in a Daudi lymphoblastoid cell extract (Fig.4 A) or recombinant RNase L (Fig. 4 B) was degraded to a 37-kDa truncated RNase L by purified HLE (Fig. 4, A (lanes 2–4) andB (lane 2)). It should be noted that the degradation of recombinant RNase L by PBMC CFS extract (Fig.4 B, lane 5) gave rise to an identical pattern. Moreover, the addition of HLE inhibitor III blocked the degradation of recombinant RNase L by purified HLE (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4) or by PBMC CFS extracts (lanes 6and 7).Figure 4RNase L is proteolyzed into a 37-kDa truncated form by purified HLE. 2-5A-labeled endogenous RNase L in a Daudi lymphoblastoid cell extract (panel A) was incubated 30 min at 37 °C in the absence (lane 1) or the presence (lanes 2–4) of increasing amounts (5 × 10−4, 5 × 10−3, and 5 × 10−2 units, respectively) of purified HLE. 2-5A-labeled recombinant RNase L (panel B) was incubated 15 min at 37 °C in the absence of proteases (lane 1), the presence of 4 × 10−3 HLE units (lanes 2–4), or the presence of minute amounts of CFS extract (lanes 5–7) as a source of proteases. HLE inhibitor III was eventually added (lanes 3 and 6). Controls for the absence of Me2SO (DMSO) effects are shown in lanes 4 and 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Evaluating the RNase L-associated biological activity in unfractionated cell extracts was difficult due to its low abundance, the presence of inhibitors, and the presence of other nucleases. We therefore made use of the model system described above and of the short radiolabeled RNA substrate (C11U2C7) described by Carrollet al. (16Carroll S.S. Chen E. Viscount T. Geib J. Sardana M.K. Gehman J. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4988-4992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recombinant RNase L was digested by purified HLE or by a low concentration of PBMC CFS extract, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” before being analyzed for nucleolytic activity. As seen in Fig. 5, the [32P]C11U2C7pCp substrate was cleaved to the expected 8-mer labeled degradation product ([32P]C7pCp) even when the recombinant RNase L had been degraded by purified HLE or by a low concentration of CFS extract, as a source of proteases. It should be noted that the amount of CFS extract (200 ng of total protein) used as a source of proteases was not sufficient in its own right (no recombinant RNase L added) to degrade labeled C11U2C7 (Fig. 5,lanes 7 and 8). The nucleolytic activity observed was strictly 2-5A-dependent for degraded RNase L as for intact RNase L (Fig. 5, lanes 3–6). In previous results sections the proteolysis of recombinant or endogenous RNase L was monitored by 2-5A probe labeling. This strategy was advantageous in being highly sensitive and specific for RNase L. It, of course, did not allow the detection of unlabeled proteolytic degradation products. We therefore made use of a sensitive zinc-imidazole staining method to detect proteolysis products of recombinant RNase L. As shown in Fig.6, recombinant RNase L migrated as a major 83-kDa polypeptide as expected. Upon incubation with purified HLE, RNase L was rapidly degraded into two groups of fragments migrating with molecular masses around 30 and 37 kDa, respectively. The latter had a similar electrophoretic mobility as the 2-5A labeled 37-kDa truncated form of RNase L (data not shown and Fig. 4). The same bands were detected when CFS extract was used as a source of endogenous proteases, although the pattern was complicated by the presence of PBMC extract proteins. As an example, the major 42-kDa band corresponded to β-actin. The main cleavage fragments (as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 6) were collected after electrophoretic blotting and processed for microsequencing of their N-terminal ends. The N-terminal sequences of the 30-kDa fragments were500HLADFDKSI508 and492LIDSKKAAH500 when produced by HLE or by CFS extract protease digestion, respectively. The observed electrophoretic mobilities of these 30-kDa fragments were in agreement with the calculated mass for peptides extending from the proteolytic cleavage site to the C-terminal end of RNase L. No N-terminal sequence could be identified for the 37-kDa fragments produced by HLA or CFS extract proteolysis of recombinant RNase L, suggesting an N-terminally blocked end. This was expected if these 37-kDa fragments started at the N-terminal end of a recombinant protein produced in a baculovirus expression system. It was indeed verified that the full-size recombinant RNase L had a blocked N-terminal end (data not shown). Moreover, recombinant RNase L (which is tagged with His6 at its N-terminal end) was digested with HLE or with CFS extract, and the His6 tag in the digestion products was identified with a specific Ni-NTA horseradish peroxidase conjugate. As shown in Fig. 7, an 83-kDa band was labeled in intact recombinant RNase L, and a major 37-kDa band was detected after proteolysis. These major 30- and 37 kDa cleavage fragments remain associated, as evidenced by pull down experiments. We took advantage of the presence of the His6 tag at the N-terminal end of recombinant RNase L to immobilize the enzyme on Ni-NTA magnetic-agarose beads (Fig.8, lane 1). Treatment of bound RNase L with HLE followed by extensive washings led to proteolysis of the 83-kDa material into the expected 30- and 37-kDa fragments, which both remained bound to the beads (Fig. 8, lane 3). None of the 30-kDa material was released in the supernatant after proteolysis (Fig. 8, lane 2). We have established here that the 37-kDa 2-5A-binding polypeptide that accumulates in CFS PBMC can be generated by proteolysis of endogenous RNase L (Fig. 1) or by the incubation of recombinant RNase L with a low concentration of PBMC CFS extract (Fig. 2), in keeping with preliminary studies from our group (18Lebleu B.

Increased proteolytic activity in CFS PBMC, thus, appears to be the major cause for the occurrence of this 37-kDa 2-5A-binding polypeptide and rules out differential RNA splicing or protein splicing as discussed by Shetzline et al.(20Shetzline S.E. Martinand-Mari C. Reichenbach N.L. Buletic Z. Lebleu B. Pfleiderer W. Charubala R., De Meirleir K., De Becker P. Peterson D.L. Herst C.V. Englebienne P. Suhadolnik R.J. J.

Proteases play an important role in numerous physiological responses and, in particular, in inflammation and apoptosis. Some of the symptoms observed in CFS can be related to a dysregulation of these functions. As an example, CFS is associated with increased IL6 secretion and elevated α2-macroglobulin, suggesting an acute phase inflammatory response (21Cannon J.G. Angel J.B. Ball R.W. Abad L.W. Fagioli L. Komaroff A.L. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, infections by various pathogenic agents (5DeFreitas E. Hilliard B. Cheney P.R. Bell D.S.

Nicolson G.L. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1999; 18: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have been described in CFS patients and can lead to inflammatory processes. Finally, an increased apoptosis has been documented in CFS PBMC (22Vojdani A. Ghoneum M. Choppa P.C. Magtoto L. Lapp C.W. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and RNase L is known to be involved in apoptosis in response to various stimuli (23Zhou A. Paranjape J. Brown T.L. Nie H. Naik S. Dong B. Chang A. Trapp B. Fairchild R. Colmenares C. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6355-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 24Rusch L. Zhou A. Silverman R.H. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A panel of proteases known to act in cell apoptosis or in inflammatory responses have, therefore, been evaluated for their abilities to degrade RNase L. Caspase 3 is not activated in CFS PBMC extracts, 2E. Demettre and C. Bisbal, unpublished observations. and no cleavage of recombinant RNase L by caspase 3 (25Roelens, S., Herst, C. V., De Smet, K., D'Haese, A., Frémont, M., De Meirleir, K., Englebienne, P., American Association for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Fifth International Research, Clinical and Patient Conference, January 26–29, 2001, AACFS, 2001, 70, AACFS, Seattle, WA.Google Scholar) has been observed. HLE and cathepsin G belong to the neutral serine protease family from azurophilic granules of myeloid leukocytes and are involved in host defenses against pathogens and inflammatory responses. Interestingly, the incubation of recombinant RNase L with cathepsin G, HLE, or calpain give rise to cleavage products that are similar to those found upon PBMC CFS incubation (Fig.1). 3E. Demettre, L. Bastide, and A. D'Haese, unpublished observations. This criterion alone, however, does not implicate these proteases in the processing of RNase L. Indeed, protein cleavage by a protease at a given site often reflects protein structure only (26Fontana A. Polverino de Laureto P., De Filippis V. Scaramella E. Zambonin M. Fold. Des. 1997; 2: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). An additional argument for HLE involvement in the proteolysis of RNase L in CFS PBMC extract is the observation that HLE inhibitor III, a specific peptide inhibitor of HLE (27Powers J.C. Gupton B.F. Harley A.D. Nishino N. Whitley R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 485: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28Stein R.L. Trainor D.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5414-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), inhibits, at least, in part the accumulation of the 37-kDa truncated RNase L in these extracts (Fig. 3). Although the role of other proteases cannot be excluded at this stage, enhanced HLE activity appears to be involved in the increased proteolysis of RNase L in CFS PBMC. Whether this increased proteolytic activity results from enzyme activation, enzyme redistribution, or other mechanisms is presently unknown. Whatever the underlying mechanism, degradation of recombinant RNase L by purified HLE represents a convenient tool to generate RNase L cleavage fragments for further biochemical characterization. Indeed, the cleavage of recombinant RNase L by HLE mimics RNase L proteolysis in CFS PBMC by the following criteria. First, the same products are generated upon cleavage of recombinant RNase L by purified HLE or by CFS extract, whether 2-5A probe labeling (Fig. 4 B), zinc-imidazole staining (Fig. 6), or detection of the N-terminal His tag (Fig. 7) are monitored. Second, the 2-5A-labeled 37-kDa fragments produced by the proteolysis of endogenous RNase L in a CFS PBMC extract or by the degradation of recombinant RNase L with HLE give rise to identical sets of 2-5A-labeled peptides after limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin or with V8 protease (data not shown). Third, the incubation of recombinant RNase L with either HLE or CFS extracts gives rise to closely related 30-kDa fragments, as indicated by the microsequencing of their N-terminal sequences (Fig.9). Finally, the nucleolytic activity of both sets of cleavage products is similar (Fig. 5). The two major polypeptides produced by the proteolysis of RNase L have molecular masses of 37 and 30 kDa. The 37-kDa fragment includes the N-terminal end (since it contains the N-terminal His6 tag) and the 2-5A binding site (which has been allocated to the P-loop motifs in ankyrin domains 7 and 8) (29Silverman R.H. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 515-551Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig.9). Its C-terminal end has not been precisely located, but it most probably ends shortly after the P-loops at the end of the ankyrin domains region (Fig. 9). The 30-kDa fragment starts in the second half of the protein kinase homology domain (at amino acid 500 after HLE proteolysis) and extends until the C-terminal end of RNase L, thus encompassing its catalytic site (Fig. 9). Proteolysis of RNase L then removes the first half of the protein kinase homology domain. Whether the increased proteolysis of RNase L in CFS PBMC has a significant qualitative or quantitative effect on its biological activity has not been fully appreciated. Shetzline and Suhadolnik (13Shetzline S.E. Suhadolnik R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23707-23711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) document a slightly increased nuclease activity in affinity-purified CFS PBMC extracts. Unfortunately, their experimental model could not exclude a contribution of other nucleases in the degradation of the poly(U) substrate used in their experiments. We made use of the simplified biological model of proteolysis described above and of a short synthetic C11U2C7-labeled substrate containing an unique and specific cleavage site for RNase L. Its 2-5A-dependent cleavage by RNase L at this site gives rise to a single 8-mer cleavage fragment that can easily be resolved and quantified by gel electrophoresis. This assay confirms that the biological activity of proteolyzed RNase L is not dramatically different from native RNase L, in agreement with Shetzline and Suhadolnik (13Shetzline S.E. Suhadolnik R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23707-23711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A 2-5A-dependent nuclease activity remains after the proteolysis of recombinant RNase L in its 30- and 37-kDa major cleavage fragments. The 30-kDa fragment, which encompasses the C-terminal catalytic site of RNase L, could potentially be active but does not include the 2-5A binding site. Interestingly in this respect, an N-terminal-deleted recombinant form of RNase L lacking all ankyrin domains (which could be analogous to the 30-kDa fragment described here) exhibits a 2-5A-independent nuclease activity (17Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the 37-kDa fragment, which encompasses the His6-tagged N-terminal end of RNase L and the 2-5A binding site, cannot include the catalytic site. In principle, therefore, a 2-5A-dependent nuclease activity cannot be assigned to the 30-kDa or to the 37-kDa fragment alone. However, these two fragments could remain linked together by disulfide bridges or by non-covalent bonds after proteolysis, as suggested by the pull down experiments (Fig. 8), and lead to the observed 2-5A-dependent nuclease activity. Alternative possibilities to bring together the 2-5A binding site and the catalytic site within a single 37-kDa polypeptide have been proposed by Shetzline and Suhadolnik (14Whitaker J.R. Granum P.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). They imply non-conventional mechanisms such as ribosomal hopping or protein splicing, which have to be experimentally demonstrated. Whatever the case, RNase L proteolysis removes the Cys-rich region (in the protein kinase homology domain) of RNase L, which is believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions. It is, therefore, conceivable that the proteolysis of RNase L might alter its interaction with regulatory proteins or its compartmentalization. Such dysregulation could in turn lead to the degradation of cellular mRNA species, which are not normal targets of native RNase L. We thank Dr. J. Derencourt for help with the N-terminal sequencing, Prof. R. J. Suhadolnik (Temple University) for communicating unpublished data and for valuable discussions, and Dr. I. Robbins for editing the manuscript."

Hb, being a direct link between the exterior and body requirements, has experienced a major evolutionary pressure to adapt and modify its functional features. The capacity of fish to colonize a large variety of habitats appears to have evolved in parallel with suitable modulation of their Hb systems at the molecular/functional level. Hbs generally exhibit marked cooperativity between the oxygen-binding sites of their subunits, which enables maximum oxygen unloading at relatively high oxygen tension. According to the two-state model (1Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6150) Google Scholar), cooperativity of oxygen binding arises from a concerted transition between the T and R states. These two extreme conformational states are also involved in modulation of the oxygen affinity brought about by protons, organophosphates, chloride, and carbon dioxide (2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1982Google Scholar). Within the framework of this common mechanism, the respiratory proteins of polar organisms have acquired adaptive mechanisms to meet special needs. Organisms living in extreme environments, such as the Arctic and Antarctic regions, are exposed to strong constraints, among which temperature is often a driving factor. The northern and southern polar oceans have very different characteristics, and the climatic features of the Antarctic waters are more extreme than those of the Arctic. Due to an oceanographic system, i.e. the Antarctic Polar Front, the ichthyofauna is virtually isolated. The evolutionary trend of Antarctic fish, in the process of cold adaptation, has led to unique specializations, including modification of the hematological characteristics, e.g. Hb multiplicity. The vast majority of species of the largely endemic suborder Notothenioidei are bottom dwellers and have a single major Hb (Hb 1), sometimes accompanied by a second, functionally indistinguishable minor component (Hb 2, about 5% of the total) (3di Prisco G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23780-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), have high multiplicity of functionally distinct Hbs. The former two species are active and cryopelagic; the latter is pelagic, sluggish but migratory. Thus, the lifestyle of each of these species differs from that of the sluggish species, which spend most of their life on the sea floor, and this is reflected in three specific oxygen-transport systems. In the Arctic, isolation is less stringent; the range of temperature variations is wider, both in the ocean and in the surrounding lands, which are directly linked to temperate areas, facilitating migration and redistribution of the ichthyofauna. Being an intermediate system, the Arctic thus provides the connection between the most extreme, simpler Antarctic system and the very complex temperate and tropical systems. For this reason, our investigations on the molecular bases of fish cold adaptation have been extended to the Arctic environment. It should be noted that the structure and function of Arctic fish Hbs are virtually unknown. This study reports the first molecular characterization of the oxygen transport system of an Arctic fish species that has an important role in fishery and aquaculture. The blood of the spotted wolffishAnarhichas minor (a benthic, sedentary fish of the family Anarhichadidae, suborder Zoarcoidei, superorder Acanthopterygii) was found to contain three components (Hb 1, Hb 2, and Hb 3). Their amino acid sequences, oxygen binding properties, and thermodynamic features were investigated. Important characteristics in the primary structures are likely to be related to the marked functional differences shown by these Hbs in pH/organophosphate regulation and thermodynamic behavior. Molecular modeling revealed that Hb 3 (the only component that shows very strong Bohr and Root effects, accompanied by strong organophosphate regulation) has distinct binding sites for ATP (the physiological ligand) and inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP).1 The ensemble of results suggests that, in the two polar environments, the evolution of the fish respiratory systems has followed diversified pathways.

All steps were carried out at 0–5 °C. No oxidation was spectrophotometrically detectable. Hb solutions were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C until use. Alkylation of the sulfhydryl groups with 4-vinylpyridine, deacetylation of the α chain N terminus, tryptic digestions, and CNBr cleavage were carried out as described previously (9Tamburrini M.

Sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 automatic sequencer equipped with on-line detection of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids. The molecular mass of the S-pyridylethylated α and β chains and of peptides (<10 kDa) was measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE Biospectrometry Work station. Analyses were performed on premixed solutions prepared by diluting samples (final concentration, 5 pmol·μl−1) in 4 volumes of matrix, namely, 10 mg·ml−1 sinapinic acid in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (globins), and 10 mg·ml−1α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60% acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (peptides). Hemolysate stripping was carried out as described previously (16Tamburrini M. Condo' S.G. di Prisco G. Giardina B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Oxygen equilibria were measured in 100 mm HEPES in the pH range 6.0–8.5 at 6 °C and 10 °C (keeping the pH variation as a function of temperature in due account) at a final Hb concentration of 0.5–1.0 mm on a heme basis. An average S.D. of ±3% for values of p 50 was calculated; experiments were performed in duplicate. To obtain stepwise oxygen saturation, a modified gas diffusion chamber was used, coupled with cascaded Wösthoff pumps for mixing pure nitrogen with air (17Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1987; 157: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). pH values were measured with a Radiometer BMS Mk2 thermostated electrode. Sensitivity to chloride was assessed by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 100 mm. The effects of ATP and IHP were measured at a final ligand concentration of 3 mm, namely, a large excess over tetrameric Hb concentration. Oxygen affinity (p 50) and cooperativity (n 50) were calculated from the linearized Hill plot of log S/(1 − S) versus logpO2 at half saturation; S = fractional oxygen saturation. The overall oxygenation enthalpy change ΔH (in kcal·mol−1; 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ), corrected for the heat of oxygen solubilization (−3 kcal·mol−1), was calculated by the integrated van't Hoff equation ΔH = −4.574[(T1 × T2)/(T1 − T2)] Δlog p 50/1000. Because phosphate ions preferentially bind to the deoxy T state, molecular models of Hb 2 and Hb 3 were built using the crystallographic structure of deoxy-Hb of the Antarctic fishTrematomus bernacchii (Protein Data Bank code 1hbh) (18Ito N. Komiyama N.H. Fermi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as template. Amino acid residues identical to those of the template in the same sequence positions were assumed to maintain the same conformations; replacements were manually modeled in, using the low-energy rotamer conformation (19Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). To ensure the stability of the models, a 5-Å water shell was subsequently added around both Hbs. Hydrogen atoms were added to the models at pH 8.0, partial charges were assigned to all atoms, and refinement was performed by the most commonly used methods (20Bajorath J. Stenkamp R. Aruffo A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1798-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). pH 8.0 was chosen because at this value Hb 3, unlike Hb 2, showed maximal difference in oxygen affinity in the presence of IHP. After minimization of the models, the ATP and IHP molecules were added by automated docking to the classical phosphate binding site of both Hbs in the central cavity located between the two β chains of the deoxy form (21Arnone A. Perutz M.F. Nature. 1974; 249: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Richard V. Dodson G.G. Mauguen Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Automated docking was carried out with the Affinity package (Biosym/Molecular Simulation Inc.). This program finds the best binding structures of the ligand based on the energy of the ligand·receptor complex, with the ligand and the binding site of the receptor flexible during the search. The ligand/receptor system was partitioned into two subsets, i.e. bulk and movable atoms. Bulk atoms are defined as the atoms of the receptor that are not located in the binding site, and they were held rigid during the docking search. Movable atoms include those located in the binding region and can thus move freely, except for atoms of the binding site close to restrained bulk atoms. The molecular model of IHP was built using cyclohexane as template (23Tamburrini M. Riccio A. Romano M. Giardina B. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6089-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); the phosphate groups were considered to have a total charge of −9.0 at pH 8.0 (24Zuiderweg E.R.P. van Beek G.G.M. De Bruin S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); the model was identical to that reported in the crystallographic structure of the human deoxy-Hb·IHP complex (21Arnone A. Perutz M.F. Nature. 1974; 249: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The molecular model of ATP was built using the crystallographic structure of ATPase as template (25Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), the total charge was −4.0 at pH 8.0. In the starting models of the automated docking, ATP and IHP sit in the central cavity formed by the two β chains, and the movable subset is formed by the residues within 12 Å from the organophosphate. The consistent valence force field parameters were used in all calculations with a distance-dependent dielectric constant ε = 1xR and a 12-Å cutoff distance for the treatment of the electrostatic and nonbonded interactions. The pK a values of Glu-2 of the two β chains of Hb 3 were established by the Delphi package (Biosym/Molecular Simulation Inc.), using a solvent dielectric constant ε = 80, a solute dielectric constant ε = 4, an ionic concentration of 0.1m, and the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for calculating the electrostatic potential. Computer graphics, structural manipulations, and energy minimization calculations were carried out in a Silicon Graphics R12000 work station using the Insight II software package (Biosym/Molecular Simulation Inc.). The Discover-3 package (Biosym/Molecular Simulation Inc.) was used for all energy refinement procedures. Multiple alignments of globin amino acid sequences were performed with the program Clustal X. Phylogenetic trees of globin sequences were inferred using maximum parsimony and neighbor joining methods implemented in the programs PAUP*4b10 (26Swofford D.L. PAUP*: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (and Other Methods). Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1998Google Scholar) and MEGA 2 (27Kumar S. Tamura K. Jakobsen I. Nei M.

Substitution model and settings maximizing the likelihood function were estimated by the program Treepuzzle (28Strimmer K. von Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 13: 964-969Crossref Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) and used as parameters in the construction of the neighbor joining topology. Ion-exchange chromatography of the hemolysate showed three components, indicated as Hb 1, Hb 2, and Hb 3. Purification was achieved by Tris-HCl gradient elution (Fig. 1); Hb 1 emerged with the equilibration buffer as a discrete peak. Globins were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Fig.2 reports the elution profile of the globins found in the hemolysate. The elution time and partial sequencing of the globins of each purified Hb indicated that Hb 1 and Hb 2 have identical β chains (indicated as β1) and differ by the α chain (α1 and α2), Hb 3 differs from Hb 2 only by the β chain (β2), and Hb 1 and Hb 3 have no chain in common. Thus the chain composition of Hb 1, Hb 2, and Hb 3 is α 21β 21, α 22β 21, and α 22β 22, respectively. The sequences of the two α and of the two β chains (142 and 146 residues, respectively) constituting the three Hbs of A. minor are reported in Fig.3. They were established by alignment of tryptic and CNBr peptides (data not shown) and on the basis of the strong sequence identity with other Hbs. The N terminus of the α chains was not available to Edman degradation. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the N-terminal tryptic peptides revealed acetyl to be the blocking group, similar to teleost Hbs sequenced to date. The molecular mass of the four globins is 15,738 and 15,567 Da for α1 and α2 (including the acetyl group) and 16,049 and 16,290 Da for β1 and β2, respectively. These values are in agreement with the mass of the four globins determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Among the functionally important amino acid residues suggested by Perutz and Brunori (29Perutz M.F. Brunori M. Nature. 1982; 299: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) to be involved in the molecular mechanism of the Bohr and Root effects in fish Hbs, in the β1 chain of Hb 1 and Hb 2, Ser F9, Glu FG1, and Gln HC1 are conserved, whereas His HC3 is replaced by Cys. In the β2 chain of Hb 3, all four residues are conserved. The functional implications will be discussed below. Val E11, usually present at the distal side of heme, is replaced by Ile in the β2 chain of Hb 3. This substitution may produce functional subunit heterogeneity, as reported for Hb of the temperate fish Chelidonichthys kumu (30Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In Hb A mutants, it has been shown that the bulky side chain of Ile E11 blocks the access of oxygen to the β chain, significantly lowering the association (and equilibrium) constant both in the T state (31Nagai K. Luisi B.F. Shih D.T.-b. Miyazaki G. Imai K. Poyart C., De Young A. Kwiatkowski L. Noble R.W. Lin S.-H. Yu N.-T.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16573-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in fact, in deoxy human Hb A, Val E11 overlaps the ligand binding site and is considered to play a key role in controlling the oxygen affinity (33Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. Fourme R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Hb 3 displays other potentially important substitutions with respect to human Hb A, namely, in β2, Lys E3 and Lys E10, close to distal His E7, are replaced by Asn and Ile, respectively, producing large electrostatic variations in the distal portion of the heme pocket. At the α1β2 “dovetailed” switch interface, several substitutions are observed when compared with human Hb A. In all three Hbs, two of the residues forming the α1β2 switch region in Hb A (His βFG4 and Thr αC6) are conserved, whereas in both α1 and α2, Thr αC3 and Pro αCD2 are replaced by Gln and Ser, respectively. In comparison with Antarctic Hbs, α1 and β2of A. minor display higher identity with the corresponding chains of minor Hbs (Hb 2 and Hb C), whereas the α2 and β1 chains have higher identity with the chains of major Hbs (Table I). It follows that Hb 2 is the only component of A. minor displaying overall higher identity with the major Antarctic fish Hbs. In all cases, the identities are consistently higher than those with Hbs of temperate species (34Stam W.T. Beintema J.J. D'Avino R. Tamburrini M. di Prisco G. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab To gain further insight, phylogenetic analysis was undertaken. Phylogenetic trees for both α and β globin sequences inferred with the neighbor joining method are shown in Fig.4. The polytomies concerning some groups, including the Antarctic group, must be ascribed to the low variability among vertebrate globins at the protein level. However, some general conclusions can be drawn. In both trees, the globin sequences of freshwater fish are grouped in distinct clades with respect to the clade formed by the marine species. The latter clade includes two subclades, one containing the major chains of Antarctic Notothenioidei, and the other containing the minor chains of Antarctic Notothenioidei. Temperate marine species (Thunnus thynnusand C. kumu) occupy intermediate positions between the two Antarctic globin families. In Fig. 4 A, the α2chain shared by A. minor Hb 2 and Hb 3 is close to the major Antarctic globins but also to the two temperate globins, whereas α1 of Hb 1 appears more closely related to minor Antarctic globins. In the tree of Fig. 4 B, relative to the β chains, the position of the A. minor β1chain shared by Hb 1 and Hb 2 is placed in the group of the major Antarctic globins, whereas the Hb 3 β2 chain is close to the C. kumu globin, and both appear well separated from the subclades of major and minor Antarctic globins. Analogous results were obtained by applying the maximum parsimony method. A. minor Hb 1 and Hb 2 displayed a modest Bohr effect that was slightly enhanced by the physiological ligand ATP (data not shown) and, in a similar way, by IHP. IHP, both alone and in association with chloride, decreased the affinity, but chloride alone had no effect. The effect of IHP was investigated because, as an alternative to some physiological ligands (2,3-diphosphoglycerate and ATP), this organophosphate has often been used to study the functional modulation of Hb (35Kister J. Poyart C. Edelstein S.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Robert C.H. Fall L. Gill S.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6835-6843Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) because it possesses additional negative charges and displays a larger effect. Fig. 5 A reports the curves of Hb 2 (the most abundant component), omitting those of Hb 1, which are almost identical, in agreement with the log p 50values reported in Table II. In both Hbs, the Bohr coefficient (φ = Δlogp 50/ΔpH) was close to −0.35 and to −0.43 in the absence and presence of effectors, respectively. Cooperativity was relatively low, as shown by the decrease of n Hfrom about 1.7 at alkaline pH to values close to 1 at lower pH (Fig.5 B). The Root effect was absent in both the absence and presence of the effectors (Fig. 5 C).Table IIValues of log p50 of Hb 1 and Hb 2 at 6 °CHb component100 mm NaCl3 mmIHPpH6.07.08.0Hb 1−−0.970.590.32+−1.040.710.40++1.301.020.55Hb 2−−0.920.570.33+−1.000.620.30++1.150.880.43 Open table in a new tab In comparison with Hb 1 and Hb 2, the oxygen binding features of Hb 3 were quite different. The oxygen affinity was very strongly regulated by protons and organophosphates. The Bohr effect was strong, φ = −0.63 with very high affinity at pH 8.5 (p 50 = 1.65 mmHg); at pH 6.0, the affinity became much lower (p 50 = 29.51 mmHg). Chloride had a modest effect, whereas organophosphates, both alone (data not shown) and in association with chloride, produced a large affinity decrease. This suggests that the binding sites of the two ligands do not overlap or that they overlap only partially. The effect of IHP differed from that of ATP both quantitatively and qualitatively. In fact, a dramatic decrease in affinity was observed with IHP already at alkaline pH; at pH 8.0, p 50= 55.95 mmHg, namely, a value corresponding to even lower affinity than that at pH 6.0 in the absence of effectors (Fig. 5 D). Subunit cooperativity was decreased at lower pH values (n H was 1.7–2.0 at pH 8.0 in the absence of organophosphates) and abolished by ATP and IHP (Fig. 5 E). Hb 3 showed a strong, effector-enhanced Root effect (Fig.5 F). The stripped hemolysate had intermediate oxygen binding features, reflecting the mixture of the three Hbs (Fig.6); n H was 1.7–1.8 at pH 8.0 in the absence of organophosphates. The Bohr and Root effects were enhanced by ATP and, to a larger extent, by IHP. Whole blood and intact erythrocytes were assayed in the absence of added effectors and also showed strong Bohr and Root effects (data not shown); at alkaline pH values, subunit cooperativity was lower than that of the stripped hemolysate in the absence of effectors, due to the presence of endogenous organophosphates. The temperature dependence of oxygen binding equilibria was investigated in the 6–10 °C range (Table III).Table IIIOverall oxygenation enthalpy change (ΔH)3-aΔH values are in kcal·mol−1 (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ). of A. minor hemolysate and HbsHb component100 mm NaCl3 mmIHPpH6.07.08.0Unstripped hemolysate−−−1.3−5.26.1Stripped hemolysate−−−13.4−9.1−2.9+−−0.2−2.45.5++−1.32.9−11.0Hb 1−−−14.2−6.4−9.5+−1.0−8.8−2.9++−7.5−16.1−7.2Hb 2−−−7.5−7.4−3.4+−−7.2−11.5−9.6++−12.2−1.5−7.2Hb 3−−−0.3−10.6−7.6+−5.3−8.4−11.6++−15.8−4.4−18.13-a ΔH values are in kcal·mol−1 (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ). Open table in a new tab In human Hb A, the apparent overall oxygenation enthalpy change, ΔH, is more exothermic at alkaline pH values, where the Bohr effect is not operative, and the contribution of the Bohr protons (endothermic) is abolished. In A. minor Hb 1, in the absence of effectors, ΔH reaches a minimum in absolute value at pH 7.0 and tends to become more exothermic at higher or lower pH. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that of Hb 2 only when both effectors are present. In the absence of effectors, in Hb 2 ΔH maintains a rather constant absolute value, much lower than that in Hb 1 at pH 6.0 and 8.0. Similar to Hb A, in Hb 3 the oxygenation process, also in the presence of chloride, is more exothermic at alkaline pH; as pH falls, ΔH becomes less exothermic, due to the increasing contribution of the Bohr protons, which cancel some of the heat released upon oxygen binding (37Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1977: 178-187Google Scholar). However, when organophosphates are also present, ΔH becomes more exothermic at pH 6.0 and 8.0. This is in contrast with Hb 1 and Hb 2. Thus organophosphates have a large, but different, influence on the thermodynamic behavior of the three Hbs. In the stripped hemolysate, the combined presence of the three Hbs produced a progressively increasingly exothermic character of oxygen binding in the absence of the effectors as pH is lowered, despite the increasing concentration of the Bohr protons. This thermodynamic behavior is opposite to"

Whether similar mechanisms govern the specialized patterns of gene expression seen in other tissues is currently under intense investigation. The intestinal epithelium is a complex and dynamic tissue containing migrating cells that undergo phases of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis over the course of a few days (7Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Such diverse cellular processes probably require transient patterns of gene expression. In many instances, cells positioned in the proliferative compartment in the lower regions of the crypts in the colon and small intestine express different genes compared with cells differentiating in the upper regions of the crypts and those in the small intestine migrating along the villi. The caudal-related family of transcription factors, which includes CDX11 and CDX2, appears to differentially regulate the expression of many genes that contribute to intestinal function (8Suh E.

The gradients (Fig. 1A) indicate differential expression along the rostrocaudal axis of the intestine, whereas thevertical bars indicate differential expression depending on the position of the cell along the crypt-villus axis in the small intestine (Fig. 1B) and along the crypt axis in the colon (Fig. 1C). This background prompted us to undertake a study of the human A33 (hA33) antigen gene with the aim of delineating regions of the promoter that may mediate its unique pattern of expression in vivo. Here we describe the cloning, chromosomal localizations, exon-intron structures, and transcription start sites of both the hA33 and mA33 antigen genes. A comprehensive in vitro characterization of the 5′-regulatory region of the hA33 antigen gene is presented that allows us to point to positive cis-regulatory elements located just upstream from the transcription start site as being important for the intestine-specific expression pattern of this gene. Our results provide evidence that the A33 antigen gene may be one of a few target genes to be described thus far for the intestine-specific homeobox transcription factor, CDX1 (24Freund J.N.

All cell lines (SW1222, LS174T, LIM1215, LIM1899, LIM1863, KM12SM, SW480, Caco-2, Caco-2-C2Bbe1, LIM2099, LIM2405, HCT116, LIM2537 Colo526, and U2-OS) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with ADDS (0.025 unit/ml insulin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 0.001% thioglycerol) and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (10%; CSL Ltd., Parkville, Australia) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. The LIM cell lines were derived in-house from human colorectal carcinoma (27Whitehead R.H. Zhang H.H. Hayward I.P. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 227-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other CRC cell lines plus U2-OS (derived from a human osteosarcoma) and Colo526 (derived from a human uterine carcinosarcoma) are available from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The exon-intron structure of the hA33 antigen gene was assembled from genomic clones, and PCR products were amplified from human genomic DNA. Approximately 106 clones of a human placental genomic DNA library in Lambda FIX II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were screened with a 2.6-kb hA33 antigen cDNA probe (17Heath J.K. White S.J. Johnstone C.N. Catimel B. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L., Tu, G.F., Ji, H. Whitehead R.H. Groenen L.C. Scott A.M. Ritter G. Cohen L. Welt S. Old L.J. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The insert from one putatively positive clone (SW1; size, ∼17 kb) was excised using NotI and subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). In addition, PCRs of human genomic DNA with exon-specific primers designed to amplify individual introns were carried out using the EXPAND 20kbPlus PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each exon-intron boundary and all of introns 5 and 6 were sequenced on both strands. To obtain 5′-flanking sequences of the hA33 antigen gene, a 488-bp probe was generated by PCR using forward primer 2843 (5′-TTTCCCAGTGAGCTCTCTCT) and reverse primer 2844 (5′-TTGAGTTGGGTTCTGTGACT) to amplify a region in intron 1 in clone SW1. One putatively positive clone (28A) was obtained from a screen of the human placental genomic library, and the insert (size, ∼17 kb) was excised with NotI and subcloned into pBluescript (KS+). The transcription start site of the hA33 antigen gene was determined using a 5′-RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method (GeneRacer; Invitrogen). The GeneRacer strategy aims to amplify only cDNA molecules containing the ultimate 5′ terminus. Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA extracted from both LIM1215 cells and normal human colonic epithelium were dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the 5′-terminal phosphates from all RNA molecules without a 5′-methyl guanosine cap structure. The RNA was then treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove all the caps and release free 5′-phosphates, which were ligated to synthetic RNA adaptor molecules provided in the kit. Human A33 antigen gene-specific antisense primer, FJC1 (5′-GAGTGTAAACAACACAGGCCACATCTTC), was used with THERMOSCRIPT RT (Invitrogen) at 65 °C to generate cDNA strands complementary to full-length mRNA molecules. These were amplified in touchdown PCRs using PLATINUM Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) to generate products containing the transcription start site. The PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into the pCR 4-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), and multiple clones were sequenced on both strands. A 217-bp PCR product encompassing part of the V-type domain of mA33 antigen was generated using forward primer 1867 (5′-TGACAAAGAAATACATC) and reverse primer 1868 (5′-TCTGGCTTGGAGGGTGG), radiolabeled, and used to screen 1.25 × 106 clones of a 129/SvJ mouse genomic library in the Lambda FIX II vector (Stratagene). The inserts from three putatively positive clones (1A, 4A, and 7B; size range, 16–18 kb; Fig. 2) were excised using NotI and subcloned into pBluescript (KS+). The distribution of exons was determined by Southern analysis using mA33 antigen exon-specific oligonucleotide probes. To obtain mA33 antigen genomic clones containing more 5′ regions, a 132-bp probe encompassing most of exon 1 was generated using forward primer 3428 (5′-GCCAGAGGCCATAGCTTTAACCAGACAGCC) and reverse primer 6240 (5′-TGCACAGAGCATCCACACCA) and used to screen the 129/SvJ genomic library as described above. Two almost completely overlapping clones (11.1 and 15.1) were obtained that both contained exon 1 of mA33 antigen and ∼13 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence. To determine the transcription start site of the mA33 antigen gene, we used 5′-RNA ligase-mediated-RACE (as described above) with 5 μg of total RNA extracted from normal mouse colonic epithelium and the gene-specific antisense primer, FJC6M (5′-AAGGCAGGATGTGTGGTGTGGATGTTCT). PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into the pCR 4-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), and multiple clones were sequenced on both strands. The entire hA33 antigen genomic clone, SW1, was nick-translated using biotin-14 dATP and biotin-14 dCTP (Invitrogen) and hybridized to normal human metaphase spreads in two independent experiments. Chromosome preparations were obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured for 72h. To induce R-banding, some of the cultures were synchronized with thymidine after 48 h, incubated overnight at 37 °C, and treated with 5-bromodeoxyuridine the next morning, during the final late S phase, and harvested 6 h later (28Jacky P.B.

Genet. 1991; 38: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cytogenetic harvests and slide preparations were performed using standard methods. Fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes was performed as described previously (29Pinkel D. Straume T. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2934-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar), with a few modifications. The biotin-labeled probe (100 ng), 0.1 μg of Cot-1 DNA, and 0.5 μg of herring sperm DNA were dissolved in DenHyb hybridization mixture (Sigma Chemical Co.) and denatured at 72 °C for 10 min to allow the Cot-1 DNA to anneal to repetitive sequences in the probe. The probe mixture was then applied to the slide and co-denatured with the metaphase spreads for 10 min at 82 °C on a slide warmer. Hybridization was allowed to proceed for a minimum of 24 h in a 37 °C incubator. The slides were washed at 37 °C in 2× SSC and 50% formamide for 8 min. Biotin-labeled probe detection was accomplished by incubation with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin conjugate (Intergen, Purchase, NY). Chromosome identification was performed by simultaneous hybridization with a chromosome 1-specific α-satellite repeat probe (Intergen) or by R-banding using 5-bromodeoxyuridine and mounting the slides in a modified anti-fade (p-phenylenediamine, pH 11, containing 0.01 μg/ml propidium iodide as counterstain) to produce an R-banding pattern (30Lemieux N. Dutrillaux B. Viegas-Pequignot E. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 59: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A 2.1-kb mA33 antigen cDNA probe (18Johnstone C.N. Tebbutt N.C. Abud H.E.

Genetic mapping was achieved using a (C57BL/6J × M. spretus)F1 × M. spretus backcross (BSS panel 2) generated and distributed by the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Genomic DNA from 94 backcross animals was digested with BamHI, EcoRV,PstI, SacI, and ScaI, electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels, and transferred to Hybond N+ (AmershamBiosciences). Membranes were hybridized with the mA33 antigen cDNA probe, and the segregation of mA33 antigen alleles was analyzed. Gene linkage and order were determined using the MapManager v2.6.5 program (31Manly K.F. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from cell lines either by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar) or by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA pellets were dissolved in autoclaved H2O treated with 0.1% (v/v) diethylpyrocarbonate (Sigma Chemical Co.). Northern analysis was performed as described previously (18Johnstone C.N. Tebbutt N.C. Abud H.E. White S.J. Stenvers K.L. Hall N.E. Cody S.H. Whitehead R.H. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Heath J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G500-G510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All images were generated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To identify cis-acting elements of the hA33 antigen gene regulating transcription, a nested series of fragments of the hA33 antigen 5′-flanking sequence were amplified by PCR of genomic clone 28A using the HiFi high-fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers listed in TableI. The 3′ end of all fragments terminated in exon 1 at a position 36 bp upstream of the initiation of translation. The products were subcloned into the promoterless pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), immediately upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. The orientation and fidelity of all promoter fragments were determined by nucleotide sequencing on both strands.Table IPrimers used to generate a series of nested fragments of the 5′ region of the human A33 antigen genePrimerSequencePosition relative to ATGSize of product (bp)−2.3-ForwardGGGGTACCATTCTGGAAGGTAGACTGTG−2270 to −22492235−1.2-ForwardCTCATGGTAGCTAGTTTAGC−1149 to −11301114−0.6-ForwardTGAACTTGCTACTTTCCCAG−595 to −576560−0.44-ForwardGGGGTACCAGCAAATATGGGCAACACCC−443 to −424408−0.42-ForwardGGGGTACCTCTTTTACTAGCTTGGA−423 to −407388−0.41-ForwardGGGGTACCACCCTACCTCTGAGTGC−405 to −389370−0.38-ForwardGGGGTACCCTTTTTATTATTTATTTCC−384 to −364349−0.36-ForwardGGGGTACCTGTCAGTTATAAGAGAGGCC−363 to −344328−0.22-ForwardGGGGTACCTAGGTGACACATGAGCCCAG−222 to −203187ReverseACCCGCTCGAGCACTGGCAGCCTCCATACAGG−56 to −36n/aReverseBCACTGGCAGCCTCCATACAG−55 to −36n/aThe inclusive positions of the oligonucleotide primers are described relative to the initiation of translation, where A in ATG is designated +1.

The promoter activities of the different constructs were determined in transient transfection assays using the Dual Luciferase reporter system (Promega). Cells in exponential growth phase were seeded into 24-well plates as follows: 2 × 105 cells/well for SW1222, LS174T, and KM12SM; 1.75 × 105 for LIM1215; 1.25 × 105 for SW480; 1.5 × 105 for Caco-2 and LIM2099; and 1 × 105 for Colo526, U2-OS, and 293T. The next morning, cells (∼80% confluent) were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of one of the A33 promoter-luciferase (A33-luc) constructs and 0.5 μg of the pRL-tk (Renillaluciferase-thymidine kinase promoter) vector (Promega) using 2 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 48 h later, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using 100 μl of passive lysis buffer. Firefly andRenilla luciferase activities of cell lysates (20 μl) were determined sequentially using specific substrates in a Dynatech ML3000 luminometer with the gain setting on high. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by reference to the Renilla luciferase activity of the co-transfected pRL-tk vector. Results are expressed as relative firefly luciferase activity, corresponding to the number of light units obtained from cell lysates using the firefly luciferase substrate (substrate for the A33-luc constructs) divided by the number of light units obtained with the Renilla luciferase substrate (substrate for pRL-tk). All values represent the mean ± S.E. of triplicate cultures. All experiments were performed at least three times. Cells (1 × 107) were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in 10 ml of ice-cold PBSE (1× phosphate-buffered saline + 1 mm EDTA), and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBSE, re-pelleted, resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were lysed by the addition of 25 μl of Nonidet P-40 detergent (final concentration, 0.6% (v/v)) and vortexed vigorously for 10 s. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and nuclear protein was extracted by resuspension in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant containing nuclear proteins was collected and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 20 μg of nuclear protein extract were subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (18Johnstone C.N. Tebbutt N.C. Abud H.E. White S.J. Stenvers K.L. Hall N.E. Cody S.H. Whitehead R.H. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Heath J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G500-G510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human CDX1 was detected after overnight incubation at 4 °C with a 1:200 dilution of an affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse Cdx1 polyclonal antiserum (33Silberg D.G. Furth E.E. Taylor J.K. Schuck T.

Like other plastid operons containing genes for functionally unrelated proteins, the contrasting accumulation of ndh and psaCtranscripts provides a model to investigate the mechanisms of the post-transcriptional control of gene expression, a feature of chloroplast genetic machinery, with a minimum of interference by transcriptional control. In leek (Allium porrum L), thendhD transcript (which follows the psaC gene and ends the ndhH-D operon) requires C → U editing to restore its start codon and may be used as a marker for the processing of psaC and ndhD transcripts. By determining the editing state and 5′ end sequences of specific transcripts, we demonstrated that stable monocistronic psaC mRNA results from downstream cleavages in the ndhD sequence, which renders non-functional ndhD transcripts as by-products. Alternative psaC-ndhD intergenic cleavages produce complete mRNAs for both genes, but only take place in precursors containing editing-restored ndhD start codons. Hence, post-transcriptional control acts by promoting thendhD cleavage alternative, which allows the accumulation ofpsaC mRNA at the expense of ndhD mRNA levels.

Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 2Vaistij F.E. Bourdeau E. Lemaire S.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A lot remains to be learned about factors, intermediates, and the order in which transcript processing occurs as well as the mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of specific mRNAs (frequent in operons containing genes for functionally unrelated proteins). This last is a feature of chloroplast genetic machinery in which post-transcriptional processing controls the differential expression of specific genes within the same operon. The NdhH-D operon provides a model to investigate post-transcriptional control of gene expression, because it includes six ndh genes whose protein products are present at low levels in chloroplasts, together with the psaC gene, encoding the PsaC protein (9-kDa Fe-S subunit VII) of the abundant photosystem I. The polypeptides encoded by ndhgenes are part of the thylakoid Ndh complex that has been purified from peas (3Sazanov L.A. Burrows P.A. Nixon P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and barley (4Casano L.M. Zapata J.M. Martı́n M. Sabater B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 942-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The photosystem I/Ndh ratio in chloroplasts is estimated at 200. Accordingly, the level of monocistronicpsaC mRNA is estimated to be around 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of ndh genes (5Schantz R. Bogorad L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Kanno A. Hirai A. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Meurer J. Berger A. Westhoff P.

The NdhH-D operon includes (in this order) ndhH,ndhA, ndhI, ndhG, ndhE,psaC, and ndhD genes (9Maier R.M. Neckermann K. Igloi G.L. Kössel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 614-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and produces a complex pattern of transcripts resulting from intergenic cleavages, intron splicing (within ndhA), and C → U editing at several specific sites (usually in ndhA and ndhD genes). The requirement of intron splicing prior to the editing of site III ofndhA indicates an order of the processing steps affecting the 5′ end of the primary transcript (near 8 Knt)1 due to restrictions imposed by the secondary structures of RNAs (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Schmitz-Linneweber C. Tillich M. Herrmann R.G. Maier R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4874-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The sequence of events involved in the processing of the 3′ end of the ndhH-D operon primary transcript are less known and affectspsaC and ndhD mRNAs (246 and 1503 nt, respectively, in most plants), including editing of several sites in the latter. All dicots investigated, as well as the monocots Liliaceae and Aloaceae (11Neckermann K. Zelt P. Igloi G.L. Kössel H. Maier R.M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 146: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), require editing to restore the ndhDAUG start codon from the cryptic start sequence ACG. Other monocots, such as Poaceae, have the correct ATG start codon and, therefore, do not require editing at this position. The ndhD transcripts of several plants require editing at one or two additional sites (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pertinent to this work is position +59, which is C → U edited inAllium cepa (onion), Allium porrum (leek),Allium sativa (garlic), and Aloe vera (aloe) converting the genomic encoded codon UCA for Ser to UUA for Leu (12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These four monocots also require restoration of the start codon from ACG to AUG by C → U editing, and the appropriate edited transcripts were found for garlic and aloe (12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although RT-PCR and sequencing of RNA in onion and leek demonstrated editing of position +59, it failed to detect AUG start codons restored by editing. This raised the questions of whether the ndhD message is finally translated to NDH-D polypeptide in leek and onion and if the editing status of the ndhD start codon is related to processing and accumulation of functional monocistronic mRNA of psaC. Thus, leek and onion may provide a good model to investigate the differential accumulation of psaC and ndhDmRNAs. Leek plastid DNA has a psaC-ndhD intergenic sequence of 120 nt; the 351-nt sequence spanning from the last 45 nt of psaCto the first 186 nt of ndhD has been described (12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AJ278352). This work is concerned with the identification of processing steps and RNA structural features responsible for the accumulation of monocistronicpsaC mRNA as a model of post-transcriptional control mechanisms in chloroplasts. First, we demonstrate the presence of NDH-D polypeptide in leek and identify transcripts containing psaCand/or ndhD messages. By sequencing the RACE-amplified 5′ ends of different ndhD-containing transcripts and using the editing-recovered ndhD start codon as a marker, we demonstrated that stable monocistronic psaC mRNA results from 5′ cleavages at the downstream ndhD sequence, with non-functional ndhD messages as a by-product. AlternativepsaC-ndhD intergenic cleavages produce complete gene messages but not stable psaC mRNAs. Leek (Allium porrum L) was obtained from a local grocery store. Green non-damaged leaves were used as source of chloroplast DNA and RNA. The following oligonucleotides were used: psaC2, GCACTCAATGTGTACGAGCT; psacC5, TAAGATAGACCCATGCTGC; NDC1, GTTTTGCCGATATTTGCCGG; NDC2, CTGGTAACCACGTATGTAGG; NDC8, AGATGTGAATCCGCCTGTCC; NDC7, TCCATCGATTCCCAATCTCC; NDC9, GGATCGTCCAATTGGAAATG; NDC4, TCCTGGTAAGGCAAGAGAAG; NDC11, TGAGGAACCCGCGAATATTG; NDC12, TGAAACAACTCGCAGCATGG; NA1, GCTCAATCTATTAGTTATGAAA; INTA3, GGATGAGATCAATTCGGAAGC; oligo(dT) anchor, GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGAC(T)16V; PCR anchor, GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGAC. Total DNA from leek leaves was isolated by slight modifications (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the method described by Ausubel et al. (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, NY1989Google Scholar). For RNA isolation, leaf segments (1 g) were ground in liquid nitrogen and RNA preparation was performed by phenol/SDS extraction and selective precipitation with LiCl (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jones J.D.G. Dunsmuir D. Bedbrook J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2411-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). RNA yields were ∼0.25 mg/1 g leaves. After treatement of RNA samples with formamide, transcripts were separated by electrophoresis in non-denaturing pre-cast (Reliant-Gel System) FMC gels and isolated and Northern blotted as described previously (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridizations on nylon membranes (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad) were carried out using the non-radioactive Roche Molecular Biochemicals DNA labeling and detection kit and PCR-generated probes. RNA bands isolated from agarose gels were reverse-transcribed and amplified using the Access RT-PCT System (Promega) as described previously (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the following cycling conditions: initial reverse transcription at 48 °C for 45 min; one cycle at 94 °C, 2 min; then 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 90 s; and 68 °C, 3 min for 50 cycles followed by a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min. Reverse transcription and amplification of transcripts longer than 5 Knt was performed using the Superscript One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) combined with the Elongase Amplification System (Invitrogen), with the following cycling conditions: initial reverse transcription at 48 °C for 30 min; one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; then 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 5 min for 40 cycles followed by a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min. Primer pairs were based on the sequence of the barley ndhH-D operon (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (when available) on the leekpsaC-ndhD sequence (12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are shown under “Experimental Procedures.” Amplification products were subjected to electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose gels, purified with a DNA gel extraction kit (Quiaex-II of Quiagen), and used for sequence analysis. Genomic DNA and cDNAs were sequenced in an Applied Biosystems automatic sequencer. Three to five different RT-PCR sequencing assays from each specific RNA preparation were carried out to identify editing sites. The Zuker and Stiegler program (15Zuker M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar) (GCG Inc.) was used to determine secondary structures of RNA. Selective amplification of the cDNA 5′ end of the monocistronic ndhD mRNA was performed using the 5′/3′-RACE kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the NDC4 primer incubating for 60 min at 48 °C. This cDNA was purified using the high Pure PCR Product Purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The tailing reaction of cDNA was carried out using a terminal transferase that appended a poly(A) tail to the 3′ end of the first strand cDNA. After denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 10 min at 70 °C to heat-inactivate the terminal transferase. This dA-tailed cDNA was amplified by PCR using an oligo(dT) anchor primer and the NDC2 primer using Taq DNA polymerase of Amersham Biosciences. Cycling conditions were: one cycle at 93 °C for 5 min, 93 °C for 2 min, 50 °C for 90 s, and 72 °C for 3 min for 40 cycles, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. We did a second PCR round with the oligonucleotide PCR-anchor primer and the NDC9 nested primer to obtain a visible PCR product, which was sequenced with the NDC9 primer. Activities and proteins were assayed in chloroplast extracts. Intact chloroplasts were isolated as described (16Martı́n M. Casano L.M. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). NADH dehydrogenase was solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, by adding 10% (w/v) Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 2% (∼5 mg of detergent/mg of protein) as described (4Casano L.M. Zapata J.M. Martı́n M. Sabater B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 942-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford method (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) with a Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Gel electrophoresis, zymograms, and immunoassays were preformed according to Casano et al. (4Casano L.M. Zapata J.M. Martı́n M. Sabater B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 942-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). NADH-D antibody was produced by Sigma Genosys Co. (Cambridge, UK) using a synthetic peptide as antigen, which was established by the barley NDH-D protein sequence analysis (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the antigen peptide is TWLPDTHGEAHYSTC and corresponds to amino acids 232–246 of the NDH-D protein. To determine the presence of NDH-D polypeptide in leek leaves, we analyzed the protein preparation solubilized from thylakoids. Two percent Triton (mild detergent conditions) solubilized some polypeptides and protein complexes from barley thylakoid membranes (4Casano L.M. Zapata J.M. Martı́n M. Sabater B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 942-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), including the Ndh complex. The solubilized preparation from leek thylakoids showed several NADH dehydrogenase bands in zymograms revealed after non-denaturing PAGE (Fig. 1 A). Western blot (Fig. 1 B) with antibody against barley NDH-D polypeptide showed that NDH-D polypeptide was also present in leek thylakoids and co-migrated in native PAGE, as in barley (4Casano L.M. Zapata J.M. Martı́n M. Sabater B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 942-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with the low migrating NADH dehydrogenase activity corresponding to the Ndh complex. Clearly, unless ACG can act as a start codon, leek chloroplasts must contain fully functional ndhD mRNA with the appropriate AUG start codon, which is translated to NDH-D polypeptide. However, sequencing of the RT-PCR amplification product of whole RNA preparation of leek leaves detected only an unedited (ACG) cryptic start sequence in ndhD mRNA (12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In barley, the ndhH-D operon produces numerous transcripts that are probably processing products of a full-length primary transcript (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frequently, due to competition among the different RNAs present, RT-PCR fails to amplify cDNAs of specific transcripts in the mixture of the whole RNA preparation. It may be that in total RNA of leek leaves, transcripts with editing-restored initiation codons are poor templates for RT-PCR due to competition with unedited transcripts. Hence, we investigated the status of the different transcripts of leek leaves containing thendhD message, taking advantage of the possibility to RT-PCR amplify specific RNA bands separated by non-denaturing electrophoresis (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In higher plants, psaC and ndhD genes are (in this order) the last 3′ end genes of the ndhH-D operon. Thus, we investigated transcripts of the operon containingpsaC and/or ndhD messages. Northern blots withpsaC and ndhD probes (S1 and S2, respectively) revealed a large number of transcripts in leek containing the message of one or both genes (Fig.2). Despite uncertainties due to the low band resolution after non-denaturing electrophoresis, the transcript pattern was very similar to that described for barley (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, by comparing the results shown in Fig. 2 with former Northern blots obtained with several other probes in barley, and taking into account the probable structure of the leek ndhH-D operon, a map of transcripts containing leek psaC and/or ndhDmessages is shown in Fig. 3. Monocistronic transcripts of around 0.4 and 1.7 Knt of psaCand ndhD genes, respectively, were detected in addition to many other transcripts. The largest, low abundant, transcript of 7.8 Knt must contain the message of the seven genes of the operon, including the ndhA intron and was detected with bothpsaC and ndhD probes. In fact, most of the transcripts larger than 1.7 Knt were detected with both probes.Figure 3Gene and transcript maps of thendhH-D operon of leek. The gene map of the leek operon (top) indicates the location of the edited sites discussed in this study with Roman numerals on vertical arrows. S1 and S2 probes are represented under the gene map. The map of transcripts (bottom) was deduced from Northern assays and comparison with the barley transcript map. The estimated sizes are indicated (in Knt) at the right of each transcript.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite uncertainties related to the presence of polycistronic transcripts of similar size but different message content (see transcripts of 6.7, 5.4, 2.8, and 2.0 Knt in Fig. 3), and to the different signal intensities produced by S1 and S2 probes, the relative abundance of some transcripts could be estimated. While the signal of monocistronic 1.7-Knt ndhDtranscripts was very low when compared with other transcripts detected with ndhD probe (S2, Fig. 2), the monocistronic 400-nt psaC transcript was by far the most abundant (S1, Fig. 2). This agrees with the higher amount of PsaC polypeptide (and in general photosystem I) relative to NDH polypeptides (and Ndh complex) in chloroplasts (3Sazanov L.A. Burrows P.A. Nixon P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4Casano L.M. Zapata J.M. Martı́n M. Sabater B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 942-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and suggests that the monocistronic transcript was the main translatable psaCmRNA. It is noteworthy that the S2 probe detects a 400-nt transcript of similar size to the monocistronic psaC(Fig. 2). Taking into account the short intergenic region betweenpsaC and ndhD (120 nt in leek (12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), it is possible that the 3′ end of the abundant monocistronic psaCtranscript includes part of the 5′ end of the ndhD gene. Since the S2 probe spans from +34 to +706 nt ofndhD, it could detect (although more weakly than the S1 probe) monocistronic psaC transcript. In this case, a truncated non-functional (and probably quickly degraded)ndhD transcript is produced, and the large amount of translatable mRNA of psaC would explain the low amount of monocistronic ndhD transcript. On the other hand, the low amount of the monocistronic 1.7-Knt transcript of ndhD gene raised doubts as to whether it significantly contributes to translated NDH-D polypeptide. To shed light on these questions, we investigated the editing state of sites I and II in different transcripts of leek ndhD and the 5′ end of the presumed ndhD monocistronic transcript. After electrophoresis of RNA in non-denaturing pre-prepared FMC gels, RNA bands of the four gel sections shown in Fig. 2 were isolated. Respectively and approximately, the sections contained transcripts of 6.0–8.0, 2.0–4.0, 0.8–1.9, and 0.1–0.8 Knt. cDNA synthesis, amplification with specific DNA primers, and sequencing were performed to determine whether sites I and II were edited in transcripts containing the ndhD message. Fig.4 shows the genomic sequence flanking the two potential editing sites of the ndhD gene as well as the sequence profiles determined after RT-PCR amplification with primers NDC8/NDC7 that span from position −160 to +252 with regard to the first nucleotide of the ndhD gene. The cDNA sequence profiles of Fig. 4 were obtained from RNA solubilized from gel section 1 (Fig. 2) containing transcripts of 6.0–8.0 Knt, and similar results were obtained with each of the other three sections. It was clear that the nucleotide at position +59 was always C to U edited in transcripts of all four sections (II of Fig. 4). This indicates an early editing of site II during transcript processing and coincides with the full editing of site II found when RT-PCR was performed with whole unfractionated RNA (12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, while RT-PCR with whole RNA failed to detect editing of site I (12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), assays with fractionated RNAs showed that all slices tested contained, a least, one transcript with both sites I and II edited. In fact, the profile sequence (I of Fig. 4) showed ambiguity, with both C and T nt at the second position, which indicated a mixed population of site I non-edited and site I edited transcripts in leek chloroplasts. Obviously, the first ones would account for the mRNAs translated to functional NDH-D polypeptide. ndhD mRNAs edited at site I were present even in large transcripts, hence a population of transcripts must be edited at sites I and II at an early stage during or immediately after transcription. Sequencing of RT-PCR amplifications with appropriate primers (e.g. INTA3/NDC2 primers for intron-containing and NA1/NDC2 for intron-lacking ndhA transcripts) showed that there are site I edited and site I non-edited in both ndhAintron-containing and intron-lacking transcripts (e.g. the two 6.7-Knt transcripts of Fig. 3). Editing occurs early at site II in all transcripts, but some of them are edited at a later stage or not at all at site I. The latter possibility is intriguing, and one may wonder whether transcripts not edited at site I are precursors of the highly abundant psaC moncistronic transcript. We have mentioned above that Northern blots (Fig. 2 and discussion herein) suggested that monocistronic psaC mRNA could be enlarged at its 3′ end to the first nt of ndhD, which would imply that only a fraction of primary transcripts would render full-length functional monocistronic ndhD mRNA. In this regard, Hirose and Sugiura (18Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6804-6811Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that site I editing and intergenic cleavage between the psaC and ndhD genes are required for translation to NDH-D polypeptide in tobacco. A full description of the site I editing status of each transcript would require precise gel slicing that is technically difficult. More affordable were questions concerning the editing status of monocitronic ndhD mRNA and, consequently, the equilibrium between the maturation of monocistronic mRNAs of psaC and ndhD in leek chloroplasts. Both the editing status and the sequence of the 5′ end of monocistronic ndhD mRNA was investigated by sequencing the RACE-amplified 5′ end (19Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., London1990: 28-38Google Scholar). RNAs eluted from the third gel section (Fig. 2) were used as templates to synthesize first strand cDNA with the NDC4 primer, which spans from position +710 to +730 of the barley ndhD and very probably spans the same sequence in leek. A poly(dA) tail was attached to the 5′ end of the cDNA by a terminal transferase, and this was then amplified using a 5′ oligo(dT) anchor primer and a nested 3′ primer, NDC2, which spans from position +687 to +706 of the ndhD sequence. This step eliminated a portion of the 3′ end but included the complete 5′ end. This product was again amplified using a PCR anchor primer and nested primer NDC9, which spans from position +160 to +179 of barleyndhD to obtain an adequate amount for sequencing. Agarose gel electrophoresis of all repetitions showed two amplification bands of 250 and 150 nt (Fig. 5). Obviously, the larger band must correspond to ndhD mRNA with a complete 5′ end and the shorter band to a truncated, non-functional RNA. Sequencing of the amplified bands confirmed this assumption, revealing heterogeneity of monocistronic ndhD mRNA, and also confirmed that the cryptic start sequence was restored by C to U editing in all RNAs of the large band. The sequences of both bands shown in Fig. 5 were determined four (large band) and two (short band) times after independent RACE amplifications. Sequences deduced for the amplified RNAs agreed with the predicted genomic sequence (except for editing as indicated below) and all of their 3′ ends terminated at the boundaries of the NDC9 primer sequence. However, as shown in Fig.6, the 5′ ends of the transcripts, which start from the end of the oligo(dT) anchor-poly(dA) tail, varied among the different experiments. In the large band, transcript 5′ ends were found at positions −56, −45, and −31 (two transcripts) upstream of the start codon of the ndhD gene. All had been edited at sites I and II. No trace of unedited site I was detected (Fig.6 A). In fact, no ambiguity was found at any position in the 5′ end, indicating that in each experiment, only one type of transcript is cDNA copied and/or amplified. Using a different approach, Hirose and Sugiura (18Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6804-6811Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) also found multiple 5′ ends of monocistronic functional ndhD transcripts. The short band (150 nt, Fig. 5) transcript 5′ ends were found at position +14 and +75 downstream of thendhD gene start codon (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, one can easily assume that these transcripts are not translatable to NDH-D polypeptide, although the former showed an edited site II (not shown). Probe S2 (which spans from position +34 to +706 of thendhD gene) weakly detected a transcript of ∼400 nt (Fig.2), which we tentatively assumed to be monocistronicpsaC. It would therefore be possible that the transcripts producing the short band of Fig. 5 be non-functional by-products of the processing pathway of polycistronic transcripts to monocistronicpsaC mRNA. In fact, RT-PCR amplification of RNA from the 100–800-nt gel section 4 (Fig. 2) with primers NDC8/ND11, which span from position +157 of psaC to +59 of ndhD, produced a cDNA fragment of the expected length and sequence (not shown). The nucleotide profile showed C/T ambiguity at position +2 of the included ndhD region, indicating the existence of both edited and unedited site I transcripts. Taking into account both the gel section utilized as a source of RNA and the primers, the amplified and sequenced transcripts must correspond to monocistronicpsaC mRNA, which includes a portion of the 5′ end ofndhD due to a cleavage alternative during processing. It cannot be excluded that additional, shorter monocistronicpsaC transcripts with 3′ ends terminating in thepsaC-ndhD intergenic region were also present in the 400-nt RNA gel section (Fig. 2). In summary, these results indicate that alternative cleavage of polycistronic transcripts aroundpsaC-ndhD could take place, either in the intergenic region, between positions −30 and −60 upstream of the ndhDmessage, or in the ndhD coding region between positions +10 and +80 downstream of the start codon. The first alternative produces potentially translatable monocistronic mRNAs of bothpsaC and ndhD, with the latter completely edited at sites I and II. The second alternative produces functional and stable psaC mRNA only. One immediate question was the relationship between the alternative cleavages and the large amount of psaC monocistronic transcript when compared with the low level of ndhD monocistronic transcript (Fig.2). The difference could indicate that ndhD cleavage was far more frequent than intergenic cleavage. This poses the question of why such a large primary transcript is produced if most of thendhD message will be finally lost. Another factor to be considered is the relative stability of the alternative psaCmRNAs that are produced by each of the two cleavages. It is well established (20Stern D.B. Jones H. Gruissem W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18742-18750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kudla J. Hayes R. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7137-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that plastid mRNA stability is considerably improved when large (some 15–20 nt) secondary base-pairing occurs near their 3′ end. Fig. 7 A shows the estimated 3′ end secondary structure of psaC mRNA including the intergenic psaC-ndhD sequence. The most prominent feature is a large base-pairing branch spanning from 51 to 92 nt downstream of the termination codon of psaC, which hybridizes with the sequence −70 to −18 nt upstream of thendhD initiation codon. Clearly, cleavages detected at the intergenic region (between −30 and −60 nt upstream ofndhD), while rending translatable monocistronicndhD mRNA, will not produce stable psaCmRNA because the essential stabilizing component, the base-pairing branch, is absent (60–90 nt downstream of psaC, Fig. 7). Stable monocistronic psaC mRNA requires a longer 3′ end that is close to, if not within, the ndhD coding region, which would result in a poorly translatable or non-functionalndhD message. Transcripts with a 5′ end between +10 and +80 nt downstream of thendhD initiation codon (those giving rise to the short amplification band of Fig. 5) are probably non-translatable by-products of ndhD cleavages that produce mature and stable monocistronic psaC mRNA. On the other hand, monocistronic translatable ndhD mRNA would require cleavages far upstream in the intergenic region (−70 to −18 nt upstream of the ndhD initiation codon equivalent to 51 to 92 nt downstream of the psaC termination codon, see Fig. 7) to include the GAG Shine-Dalgarno motif (Fig. 7). This motif lies precisely within the otherwise stabilizing base-pairing branch of the monocistronic psaC mRNA. The secondary structure stabilizing psaC mRNA seems to be due to a relatively conserved sequence within the psaC-ndhD intergenic region. As shown in Fig. 7, the large base-pairing branch is also predicted from the intergenic barley sequence. The GAG Shine-Dalgarno motif presumably required for ndhD translation is part of the stabilizing base-pairing branch of psaC mRNA in barley as well. Thus, our results of alternative cleavages in leek to produce monocistronic mRNAs of psaC and ndhD are probably a general feature in higher plants. When whole extracted RNA is used for RT-PCR amplification, failure to detect the editing-dependent recovery of thendhD start codon (12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is probably an artifact due to competition among the different transcripts. Non-denaturing electrophoresis produced medium quality band separation, but isolated bands were suitable for the synthesis of the corresponding cDNAs, their amplification and sequencing (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without interference from other bands. In addition, fractionation of RNA is required for unambiguous RT-PCR amplification of specific low-sized transcripts, such as monocistronic transcripts, which is a common problem in the multiple transcript operon of chloroplasts. As expected for a necessary protein (4Casano L.M. Zapata J.M. Martı́n M. Sabater B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 942-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Burrows P.A. Sazanov L.A. Svab Z. Maliga P. Nixon P.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), NDH-D polypeptide is present in leek (Fig. 1), which requires editing to restore the cryptic ndhD start codon at the RNA level. This is particularly patent in leek, where the ndhDgene lacks an alternative in-frame start codon in the region. Accordingly, partial editing of the ndhD start codon was found in all RNA fractions (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Northern assays with different probes allowed us to extend the 3′ end of the transcript map of the ndhH-D operon previously deduced for barley (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to confirm a very similar pattern in the two monocots. The map includes a large number of polycistronic transcripts containing essentially all possible combinations of contiguous gene messages (with and without the ndhA intron) as well as monocistronic transcripts corresponding to each gene. Although multiple transcription starts cannot be conclusively excluded, these results indicate that intergenic cleavage and the splicing of thendhA intron take place unspecifically at any stage of the processing pathway of primary transcripts. Results on the editing status of the different sites demonstrated that editing takes place early during processing except for site III of ndhA in barley, which requires previous intron splicing (8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and site I ofndhD in leek, which will be discussed below. The presence of psaC in the ndhH-D operon with apparently unrelated functional genes has for long attracted attention (5Schantz R. Bogorad L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), especially due to the large difference in the level of polypeptide products relative to the other genes. On the other hand, editing to restore the start codon of the contiguous ndhD gene is not complete in many plants (partial editing; Refs. 8del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Neckermann K. Zelt P. Igloi G.L. Kössel H. Maier R.M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 146: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12López-Serrano M. del Campo E.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 179-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests an interplay in the processing of psaC andndhD mRNAs. Translatability may vary among the different transcripts of one operon (23Barkan A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2637-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). By using an in vitrotranslation system for transcripts generated from a dicistronic construction of psaC and ndhD of tobacco, Hirose and Sugiura (18Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6804-6811Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) concluded that both editing and cleavage of RNA are required for translation of ndhD mRNA. Only monocistronic RNA for each psaC and ndhD is translatable in their system, and RNA protection assays revealed that cleavage occurs at multiple sites in the intergenic region (18Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6804-6811Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our results in leek confirm multiple transcripts (differing at their 5′ ends) containing translatable mRNA of ndhD and identify additional alternative cleavages within the ndhD gene to produce the translatable and stable psaC mRNA. RNA bands of 0.8–1.9 Knt (that include monocistronic ndhD) separated by non-denaturing electrophoresis were successfully amplified by RACE to sequence their 5′ ends (Figs. 5 and 6). Three types of translatable mRNA for ndhD were identified that differed at their 5′ end, respectively at positions −56, −45, and −31 upstream of the initiation codon. All had edited sites I and II and could potentially be translated to NDH-D polypeptide. Obviously, the two additional types of transcripts with 5′ ends at positions +14 and +75 downstream of the initiation codon cannot be translated to NDH-D. Very probably these last two transcripts are by-products of at least one type of mature translatable psaC mRNA. In fact, Northern assays (Fig. 2) and amplification and sequencing with appropriate primers demonstrated that part of, if not all, monocistronic 400-nt transcripts containing the psaC message had 3′ ends extending within the ndhD sequence. Only partial editing of the ndhD start codon was found in these transcripts. Significantly, a stabilizing 3′ end secondary structure (Fig. 7) may be possible in psaC mRNAs whose 3′ end includes a portion of the ndhD 5′ end, but not in those produced by the intergenic cleavages rendering translatablendhD. Post-transcriptional control must necessarily account for the different levels required of each translatable transcript of operons with functionally unrelated coding sequences (such as the ndhH-Doperon). We conclude from our results (Fig.8) that two alternative cleavages are involved in the processing of precursor RNA to functionalpsaC and ndhD mRNAs in leek. Cleavage in the ndhD coding region probably produces stable psaC mRNA but nonfunctional ndhD mRNA with major frequency. This cleavage is independent of the restoration of the cryptic start codon of ndhD by editing and can occur in both site I edited and site I non-edited transcripts. Site II is always edited. In the other less frequent processing alternative, cleavage takes place within the intergenic sequence involved in base-pairing stabilization ofpsaC mRNA (Fig. 7) and only in transcripts where site I has been edited to allow translation of ndhD mRNA. The latter alternative cleavage may potentially produce translatable mRNAs of both psaC and ndhD genes, but it is likely that this last psaC mRNA is not as stable as that produced by the first alternative cleavage. By contrast, the second alternative cleavage produces the ndhD mRNA with the full-length Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Therefore, the production of stable psaC RNA implies the loss of functionalndhD mRNA. Different rates of the alternative cleavages and stabilization of the psaC mRNA resulting fromndhD cleavage explain the far higher level ofpsaC mRNA than that of ndhD mRNA (Fig.2). Post-transcriptional control is carried out by preferential cleavage within ndhD. We thank P. Hauke for kindly lecture and suggestions."

In the present study, we used wild-type human serum albumin (HSA) and specific site-directed mutants as a native protein model to investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in halothane binding. Structural geometry analysis of the HSA-halothane complex predicted an absence of significant electrostatic interactions, and direct binding (tryptophan fluorescence and zonal elution chromatography) and stability experiments (hydrogen exchange) confirmed that loss of charge in the binding sites, by charged to uncharged mutations and by changing ionic strength of the buffer, generally increased both regional (tryptophan region) and global halothane/HSA affinity. The results indicate that electrostatic interactions (full charges) either do not contribute or diminish halothane binding to HSA, leaving only the more general hydrophobic and van der Waals forces as the major contributors to the binding interaction.

Guided by the Meyer-Overton correlation between anesthetic potency and solubility in a lipid-like environment, studies in the past three decades have concluded that anesthetics must bind to hydrophobic regions within target protein (especially membrane protein, i.e. ion channels) through weak van der Waals interactions and the hydrophobic effect (1Eckenhoff R.G. Johansson J.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 343-367PubMed Google Scholar, 2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 3Hameroff S.R. Watt R.C.

Electrostatic interactions were proposed recently as potentially important binding forces between anesthetics and target proteins (1Eckenhoff R.G. Johansson J.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 343-367PubMed Google Scholar, 6Franks N.P. Jenkins A. Conti E. Lieb W.R. Brick P. Biophys.

Halogen atoms, especially fluorine, are more electronegative than carbon atoms, and therefore the C-halogen bond is polarized in inhalational anesthetics. Ab initio calculations indicated that halothane has a small permanent dipole moment (8Tang P. Zubryzcki I. Xu Y. J. Comput. Chem. 2001; 22: 436-444Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which may contribute binding to relevant targets. Similar compounds with less dipole than halothane are poor anesthetics, although this might be partially due to much lower solubility in water (1Eckenhoff R.G. Johansson J.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 343-367PubMed Google Scholar). Because polarity appears to be an important feature of anesthetics, it is reasonable to speculate that anesthetic binding sites contain polar moieties. Charged residues such as arginine and lysine and polar but uncharged aromatic groups with a partial negative charge in the center of the ring (9Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar, 10Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar) may contribute to the polarity of anesthetic binding sites. The weakly polar anesthetics might therefore interact with the charged residues directly and/or form dipole-quadrupole (a form of weak cation-π) interactions with the aromatic side chains. The latter may be strengthened by the positively charged residues coordinating the more electronegative end of the anesthetic molecule. Because functionally important anesthetic targets remain unidentified, we have made use of surrogate proteins with appropriate binding character (1Eckenhoff R.G. Johansson J.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 343-367PubMed Google Scholar, 11Eckenhoff R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 610-615PubMed Google Scholar, 12Eckenhoff R.G. Petersen C.E., Ha, C.E. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4080-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Designed peptides, for example, have been used to investigate the halothane binding site and its characteristics. In a synthetic four-helix-bundle protein, substitution of tyrosine for tryptophan decreased anesthetic binding affinity by about 5-fold, suggesting that the less dense electron cloud of tyrosine coordinates the relatively positive end of the anesthetic molecule less well (14Manderson G.A. Johansson J.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4080-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used human serum albumin (HSA)1 as a native protein model to investigate electrostatic interactions directly. HSA is useful because it satisfies major pharmacodynamic criteria for simulating the anesthetic targets (11Eckenhoff R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 610-615PubMed Google Scholar) and has a binding affinity for halothane within 10-fold of its clinical EC50, and a high resolution structure of HSA alone and in complex with halothane is now available (15Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We focused on a large interdomain cavity containing the only tryptophan in HSA in this study. Previous work has confirmed that anesthetics bind to this region (12Eckenhoff R.G. Petersen C.E., Ha, C.E. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30439-30444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which also contains many charged residues (15Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 17Sugio S. Kashima A. Mochizuki S. Noda M. Kobayashi K. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). If the relatively positive end of halothane coordinates with the π system of the tryptophan indole ring in a weak cation-π interaction, then it is possible that nearby positively charged residues may coordinate the relatively negative trifluoromethyl end of halothane (1Eckenhoff R.G. Johansson J.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 343-367PubMed Google Scholar). We predict that loss of positively charged side chains near Trp will eliminate an electrostatic contribution to halothane binding and therefore weaken halothane-HSA binding constants. To test this, we performed geometrical analysis of HSA (1E78) and the HSA-halothane complex structures (1E7B and 1E7C), expressed nine site-directed HSA mutants, and tested these for altered halothane binding using fluorescence spectroscopy, zonal elution chromatography, and amide hydrogen exchange combined with ionic strength experiments. Halothane (1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane) was obtained from Halocarbon Laboratories (Hackensack, NJ). The thymol preservative and water in halothane were removed before use with an aluminum oxide column. [3H]OH was obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA) at 100 mCi/ml. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better and were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant wild-type HSA (wtHSA) and nine HSA mutants were expressed in a yeast expression system. Seven single mutants (K195M, K199M, R218M, R218P, R218H, R222M, and R257M) of HSA replaced positively charged residues with uncharged ones, one single mutant (H242V) replaced an uncharged polar residue with an uncharged nonpolar residue, and one single mutant (F211V) replaced an aromatic residue with an uncharged, nonpolar residue. All of the replaced residues are within 15 Å from C3 of W214 in 1E78 (TableI; Fig.1 A) and the known halothane binding sites (halothane 2005 and halothane 2006) in 1E7C (Fig.1 B) (15Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We chose these residues because each lines the tryptophan cavity (15Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol.

With human liver cDNA as a template, the entire coding region of the HSA gene, including the native signal sequence, was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The resulting DNA fragment was inserted into the plasmid vector pHiL-D2 (Invitrogen) using standard cloning techniques. pHiL-D2 is a shuttle vector that can be manipulated by cloning in Escherichia coli and can also be used to introduce genes into the yeast species Pichia pastoris (Invitrogen) by homologous recombination. Specific mutations were introduced into the HSA coding region using site-directed mutagenesis (18Petersen C.E., Ha, C.E. Mandel M. Bhagavan N.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Each pHiL-D2 expression plasmid contained a methanol-inducible promoter located upstream of the HSA coding region. For each expression plasmid, a yeast clone that contained the expression cassette stably integrated into the yeast chromosomal DNA was isolated. The native HSA signal sequence, which was introduced into the yeast genome with the HSA coding region, directed a high level secretion of mature HSA into the growth medium. The total genomic DNA from each P. pastoris clone used to produce a particular HSA species was isolated using standard techniques. The genomic DNA isolated from each clone was used as a template to amplify the entire HSA coding region by the polymerase chain reaction. For each clone, the entire HSA coding region was sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination technique, and the determined DNA sequence matched a previously published cDNA sequence of HSA at all amino acid positions except for the mutation introduced into a particular HSA variant. The secreted HSA was isolated from the growth medium as follows. The medium was brought to 50% saturation with ammonium sulfate at room temperature. The temperature was then lowered to 4 °C, and the pH was adjusted to 4.4, the isoelectric point of HSA. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in distilled water. Dialysis was carried out for 48 h at 4 °C against 100 volumes of distilled water, followed by 24 h against 100 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl and 40 mm phosphate, pH 7.4). The solution was loaded onto a column of Cibacron blue immobilized on Sepharose 6B (Sigma). After washing the column with 10 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, the HSA was eluted with 3 m NaCl. The eluent was dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline and passed over a column of Lipidx-1000 (Packard Instruments) to remove hydrophobic ligands possibly bound to the HSA. The resulting protein migrated as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Atomic coordinates of HSA (1E78) and the HSA-halothane complex (1E7B and 1E7C) (15Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb). Atomic distances were calculated with Swiss-PDB Viewer (v3.7 β2; www.expasy.ch). Potential cation-π interactions were identified with CaPTURE (capture.caltech.edu) (10Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Quenching of Trp fluorescence was used to study halothane-HSA regional binding as described previously (16Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, halothane was dissolved in the phosphate buffer to a concentration of 10 mm and loaded into a gas-tight Hamilton syringe. Different concentrations of halothane were equilibrated with 1 mmwtHSA (or mutants) in a quartz cell during fluorescence measurements. The point of 50% inhibition (IC50) of the fluorescence maxima in halothane-free species was calculated (12Eckenhoff R.G. Petersen C.E., Ha, C.E. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30439-30444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with Hill plots. The buffer used for fluorescence experimentation was 130 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Fluorescence measurements were performed with a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer RF-5301PC (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). A 10-mm-pathlength quartz cell (1.5 ml) with a polytetrafluorethylene stopper was used without much difference in air pockets. All fluorescence measurements were made at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). Excitation and emission slit widths were 3 and 5 nm, respectively. The background fluorescence was subtracted from each emission spectrum. All HSA mutants have Trp at the 214 position, which is located in subdomain IIA, one of the binding sites for aromatic and heterocyclic compounds. The single tryptophan was excited at a wavelength of 295 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 310 nm to 450 nm for all HSA mutants. In addition to the above halothane titrations, we also examined the influence of ionic strength on halothane binding to wtHSA. Thus, a halothane EC50 was calculated for titrations performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0, 130, or 500 mm sodium chloride. Zonal elution chromatography was used to study halothane-HSA global binding as we described previously (19Chan K. Meng M.C. Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 ml of Af-fiGel 10 was washed in cold distilled water and transferred to a graduated cylinder. Excess water was removed, and coupling was accomplished by adding 2.5 ml of the HSA solution (50 mg/ml) and gently mixing. After coupling for 2 h at room temperature, the gel was allowed to settle, and the supernatant was removed. To block all remaining unreacted groups, the gel was then incubated with 0.3m glycine, pH 7.0, for an additional 30 min. A control gel was prepared by reacting 3.0 ml of 0.3 m glycine, pH 7.0, with 3.0 ml of gel for 2 h as described above. Aliquots of the pre- and postcoupling solutions were saved to determine the immobilized mass. Protein assays were performed with the Bio-Rad reagent. The coupled gel was washed with degassed mobile phase (10 mmNaPO4, pH 7.0) and packed into Bio-Rad MT-2 columns (holding about 2.0 ml of gel). Columns were connected to a Shimadzu LC-600 Liquid Chromatograph pump and then flushed with mobile phase at 0.4 ml/min until a steady baseline, as detected by UV absorbance at 210 nm (Shimadzu SPD-6AV), was established. With the apparatus running at 0.4 ml/min, the column was equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing either 0, 130, or 500 mm NaCl. Small (50 μl) aliquots of 10 mm halothane in the same mobile phase were injected (t = 0), and absorbance (210 nm) was monitored for 20 min. Retention times for the halothane peaks from the different sodium chloride concentrations and for the different columns (HSA and glycine) were compared. Changes in ligand binding should be reflected in changes in protein stability, and amide hydrogen exchange is the most sensitive method of measuring these changes (15Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Protein solutions (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 5–10 mCi of [3H]OH in 1m GdnCl, 0.1 m NaH2PO4buffer, pH 8.5, for at least 18 h at room temperature for exchange-in. Free [3H]OH was removed, and the buffer was exchanged with a PD-10 gel filtration column (Sigma), thereby initiating exchange-out with 0.5 m GdnCl, 0.1 mNaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4. After recovery from the column, the protein solution was immediately transferred to prefilled Hamilton (Reno, NV) gas-tight syringes containing 7.0 mmhalothane in exchange-out buffer and equipped with repeaters. Aliquots were precipitated with 2 ml of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid at timed intervals over at least 6 h. The precipitated protein was rapidly vacuum-filtered through Whatman GF/B filters and washed with 8 ml of ice-cold 2% trichloroacetic acid. 3H retained by the protein was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Exchange-out buffer conditions were adjusted to focus on the last 5–10% of hydrogens over a 6-h period to ensure that global unfolding events were being monitored. Protection factors ratio (PFr) for given hydrogens was determined from the exchange-out curves as described previously (11Eckenhoff R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 610-615PubMed Google Scholar). The changes of free energy change (ΔΔG) were determined (ΔΔG = −RTln(PFr). Negative values reflect stabilization (slower exchange out). The influence of ionic strength on halothane stabilization to wtHSA was studied in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, obtaining different ionic strengths by including the requisite amounts of NaCl (0 and 500 mm) in the exchange-out buffer. We focused on halothane 2005 and 2006 in 1E7C because these two molecules are the closest to W214. Using distance analysis, we found that halothane does not have any orientation preference to any of the mutated residues (TableII). The closest charged residue from halothane 2005 is R257. The nearest atoms are the O of arginine and the Cl of halothane (3.6 Å). The closest charged residues from halothane 2006 are R218 and R222. In this case, the nearest atoms are C and Cl (3.1 Å) between R218 and halothane, respectively, and N and F (3.7 Å) between R222 and halothane, respectively. Only this latter N-F (3.7 Å) interaction between R222 and halothane 2006 could indicate an attractive electrostatic interaction.Table IIAtom distance (Å) from halothaneHLT 2005HLT 2006From C1From C2From C1From C2K19514.2–16.314.0–15.910.31–13.4311.1–14.6K1999.6–15.09.8–14.75.74–12.447.1–14.0F21110.3–16.210.5–16.78.4–13.39.8–14.6W2149.4–14.79.9–15.65.3–10.96.8–12.0R2189.6–12.310.6–13.54.4–7.85.0–8.1R2227.4–11.78.2–13.14.1–9.73.1–8.5H2427.1–12.36.9–11.66.5–12.87.8–14.0R2576.2–8.15.1–6.99.3–12.69.7–12.9Protein Data Bank file 1E7C by Swiss.

CaPTURE detected eight energetically significant cation-π interactions in 1E78, 1E7B (with 3 halothane molecules), and 1E7C (with 8 halothane molecules) (Table III). None of these were between halothane and HSA. Both 2005 and 2006 halothane molecules point to the tryptophan ring with their relatively negative end (trifluoromethyl end; Table IV). Although the total number of cation-π interactions was preserved in the HSA-halothane complex, the distribution was different than in HSA alone. For example, the K199-W214 interaction is not present in1E7C.Table IIIEnergetically significant cation-π interactions in HSA modelProtein Data Bank ID1E781E7B1E7CR144-Y140R222-F223R160-F156R197-Y148R144-Y140R144-Y140R257-Y150R197-Y148R257-Y150R336-Y332R336-Y332R336-Y332K106-Y148K106-Y148R410-Y411K233-Y263K233-Y263K106-Y30K414-Y411K414-Y411K233-Y263K199-W214K199-W214K323-Y319 Open table in a new tab Table IVThe distance (Å) from halothane C1 and C2 to the atom of the aromatic ring of TrpFrom C1From C2DifferenceHalothane 200510.6 ± 1.011.2 ± 1.04-ap < 0.001 by paired test.0.6Halothane 20066.5 ± 0.97.9 ± 0.84-ap < 0.001 by paired test.1.4Protein Data Bank file 1E7C by Swiss.

The distance between C1 and C2 is 1.5 (Å). With 295 nm excitation, the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission is 339 nm in wtHSA, and ranges from 338 to 340 nm in all mutants except K195M (341 nm) and R218P (343 nm). The IC50 for halothane quenching of wtHSA fluorescence was 2.9 ± 0.1 mm. The charged to uncharged mutations (K195M, K199M, R218M, R222M, and R257M) generally decreased the IC50 of halothane by 10–35%, indicating improvement in halothane binding in this W214 binding site. H242V also decreased IC50. The deletion of one aromatic ring-containing residue (F211V) also decreased the IC50 of halothane (Fig. 2). Only R218P and R218H increased IC50 (weakened binding). The change of the residue volume correlates significantly with the change in IC50 of halothane (Fig. 3); smaller residue substitution (enlarging the cavity) tends to reduce halothane binding affinity.Figure 3Cavity volume plays a role in halothane binding. Residue volume difference reflects the wild-type residue volume minus the mutant residue volume. Because all the mutations in the present study are large to small, we assumed cavity volume increased after mutation. A significant correlation (r 2 = 0.5, p = 0.03) between residue volume difference and the affinity was revealed by linear regression analysis. IC50 is the halothane concentration resulting in a 50% of inhibition of the maximum fluorescence emission.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the mutation may change native state stability, which may affect binding independently of changes in the local environment, we performed hydrogen exchange for global protein stability. These single mutations produced only small or no changes in baseline protein stability as indicated by hydrogen exchange, and the changes are limited to the mutations at position 218. ΔΔG values are 1.4 ± 0.3 kcal/mol in R218P, −0.4 ± 0.2 kcal/mol in R218H, and −0.5 ± 0.2 kcal/mol in R218M. Tryptophan fluorescence reports only a local or regional binding interaction of halothane, and it is not clear whether or how this contributes to global stability. Consistent with the tryptophan fluorescence data, hydrogen exchange shows that halothane generally enhances the global protein stability of the charged to uncharged mutants more than that of wtHSA (Fig. 4), suggesting improved specific binding and protein stabilization. Better stabilization also was observed in F211V. Despite consistency of the direction of change, there was no significant correlation between halothane IC50 and ΔΔG (Fig.5).Figure 5No significant correlation between regional (domain IIA) binding (IC50) of halothane and the global stability change (ΔΔG) by halothane was found. IC50 is the halothane concentration resulting in a 50% of inhibition of the maximum fluorescence emission. ΔΔG is the change in free energy change produced by 7 mm halothane. The linerepresents a least squares linear regression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The halothane IC50 from fluorescence experiments decreased from 4.1 ± 0.1 mm in the absence of NaCl, to 2.9 ± 0.1 mm in the presence of 130 mm NaCl and to 2.4 ± 0.3 mm in the presence of 500 mmNaCl (Fig. 6). These results indicate that with the increase of ionic strength, the affinity of HSA for halothane increased rather than decreased. From the zonal elution chromatography experiments, the retention time for halothane became more prolonged with the increase of the NaCl concentration (6.27 min in 0 mm NaCl, 6.43 min in 130 mm NaCl, and 6.77 min in 500 mm NaCl) (Fig.7). The retention time for halothane in the control column was significantly shorter (5.3 min) than that in the HSA column and did not change with the increase of NaCl concentration. The hydrogen exchange experiment shows that NaCl alone stabilized HSA, but additional stabilization by halothane in the different NaCl concentrations could not be detected (Fig.8). The polar aspect of anesthetic binding sites has been stressed many times previously (1Eckenhoff R.G. Johansson J.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 343-367PubMed Google Scholar, 6Franks N.P. Jenkins A.

Anesthesiology. 1978; 48: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) but has not been the subject of direct testing. Contrary to our initial prediction, the charged to uncharged mutation in the W214 region of HSA generally strengthened halothane binding and stabilization. Furthermore, the increase in ionic strength also enhanced both regional and global binding, and, finally, geometric analysis of high resolution structures of the halothane-HSA complex failed to provide evidence of significant electrostatic interactions in the tryptophan binding site. These results are consistent in indicating that electrostatic interactions do not enhance HSA-halothane binding. In fact, these data would suggest that electrostatic features in this cavity actually hinder halothane binding. If this binding site shares similarity with sites on functionally relevant proteins, our results suggest that binding of halothane and probably other inhaled anesthetics is controlled primary by the more general hydrophobic and van der Waals forces. Specificity to ligand protein interactions is achieved by a multiplicity of features, namely electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic, and steric effects. These factors contribute toward selective and energetic binding interactions. In a folded protein, the arrangement of positively and negatively charged residues causes a considerable variation in the electrostatic potential throughout the protein. This provides, at specific sites, significant electrostatic contributions to the free energy of binding of the ligand. For example, a major binding force between indomethacin and HSA is electrostatic in nature (24Trivedi V.D. Vorum H. Honore B. Qasim M.A. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1999; 51: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our finding that electrostatic interactions do not contribute to halothane binding in a natural and pharmacodynamically relevant protein model leaves only the other noncovalent interactions to contribute to the binding free energy. This results in low binding affinity, as shown here, and also reduces the specificity and selectivity of binding sites. This paucity of interactions suggests that many targets of comparable anesthetic binding affinity are more likely than a few high affinity targets. Structure geometrical analysis revealed an absence of direct positive and negative electrostatic interactions between halothane and the charged residues of HSA. Consistent with this, our fluorescence results showed that halothane affinity is enhanced by charged to uncharged mutations, suggesting that electrostatic interactions did not contribute to HSA-halothane binding but actually hindered the binding interaction. This is also consistent with previous potency correlative analysis (21Abraham M.H. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. J. Pharm. Sci. 1991; 80: 719-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, this conclusion must be tempered by the fact that the investigated site is complex and has several fully charged lining residues. Thus, we cannot be certain that removing a single charge at a time will not strengthen a potential electrostatic interaction with another, unaltered residue or enhance the cavity polarity in a favorable way. We think this is unlikely because a charged to uncharged mutation enhanced binding in every one of the seven positions and because geometric analysis of the HSA-halothane complex did not reveal any significant electrostatic pairs. Nevertheless, this does not eliminate a role for weak polar effects (partial charges and polarizable atoms). Small organic molecules that have anesthetic properties generally have a modest dipole moment or are polarizable; thus, it is likely that the binding environments for these compounds have a complementary polar nature. Although a charged to uncharged mutation enhanced halothane binding at every position investigated, not all such mutations had this effect. For example, whereas R218M enhanced binding, R218H and R218P decreased halothane binding somewhat. This may be explained by other effects of these less common residues. For example, whereas histidine is essentially uncharged at physiologic pH, it is nevertheless polar, bulky, and less flexible than arginine. Similarly, proline is rigid and is known to distort secondary and perhaps tertiary structure. This is consistent with the large effect of R218P on native state stability and a small red shift of the maximum fluorescence emission. Thus, it is likely that the apparent inconsistency of these two mutations at position 218 is due to unintended steric effects. Without crystal structures for each mutant, this conclusion must remain tentative. Increases in ionic strength should “screen” charges in water-accessible sites and reduce their effect on ligand binding in a competitive way. Thus, if electrostatic interactions were important, an increase in ionic strength should reduce their contribution to binding free energy and thus weaken binding. Instead, we found that an increase in ionic strength strengthened binding. Increased ionic strength also stabilized HSA as shown by hydrogen exchange, but this did not alter the degree of stabilization produced by halothane. Taken together, the ionic strength experiments also suggest that electrostatic interactions do not contribute to halothane binding energetics. Structure geometry analysis shows that cation-π interactions among amino acid residues exist in HSA, and the distribution of cation-π interactions is altered in the HSA-halothane complex. Although this might be due to competitive interactions between native cation-π and halothane, our inability to detect any cation-π interaction between any halothane atom and a protein atom makes this unlikely. Furthermore, replacing one aromatic ring in this binding cavity with an aliphatic residue (F211V) also increased halothane binding affinity. Thus, the change in cation-π distribution probably reflects a subtle change in protein conformation in the HSA-halothane complex. Our inability to detect an anesthetic-protein cation-π interaction in this HSA binding site does not negate the potential importance of such interactions in other sites. Indeed, recent work in designed four-helix bundles suggested a cation-π interaction between anesthetics and proteins (14Manderson G.A. Johansson J.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4080-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It might be relevant to note that bulky aromatic residues are more commonly found in internal protein cavities where anesthetics might be expected to bind (25Liang J. Edelsbrunner H. Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), and thus it is attractive to speculate that cation-π interactions contribute to binding in some protein targets. In addition to effects on polarity and charge, the mutations introduce volume and steric effects. If internal protein cavities are attractive binding sites for anesthetics, then volume is important; if the volume is too small, the molecule cannot be accommodated, and if it is too large, van der Waals London forces (which fall off rapidly as a function of distance) will be insufficient to produce binding. Indeed, we found a significant relationship between change in residue volume and IC50, whereby mutations producing little change in cavity volume enhanced affinity, and those increasing cavity volume reduced affinity. Thus, loss of charge appears to improve halothane binding when the change in cavity volume is small, but this is probably offset by loss of van der Waals contacts when volume change is large. Steric and conformational effects also need to be considered. For example, the slight decrease in halothane affinity in the proline and histidine mutations may relate not only to volume effects but also to the more rigid nature of their side chains. Methionine has considerable conformational entropy and thus may be able to accommodate the ligand in this tryptophan cavity at a lower free energy expense. The same would be true for the smaller aliphatic side chain of valine. Thus, the basis for alterations in affinity with these mutations is likely to be multifactorial. Halothane binds to at least 7–10 sites in HSA (12Eckenhoff R.G. Petersen C.E., Ha, C.E. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30439-30444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol.

Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), so clearly mutagenesis of all possible interacting residues would have been prohibitive. Zonal elution chromatography provides an alternative tool to investigate the global weak interaction between anesthetics and proteins (19Chan K. Meng M.C. Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Consistent with the mutagenesis and regional binding study, the result indicated that HSA affinity to halothane strengthened with the increase of the salt concentration. These experiments suggest a generality of the binding sites; electrostatic interactions do not appear to be important for binding in the other binding sites of HSA either. Most proteins are only marginally stable in order to allow the conformational changes that underlie their function. Thus, small changes in native stability may have considerable implications to protein activity and biologic function. A drawback of mutagenesis is that the mutations might disturb the global protein stability significantly and unpredictably. Thus, we considered it is important to evaluate the effects of these mutations on native state stability using amide hydrogen exchange kinetics. Fortunately, the stability change of the mutants in the present study is generally very small and is limited to mutations at the 218 position. R218P, for example, destabilized HSA by over 1 kcal/mol, which alone may have considerable effects on ligand binding and function independent of any regional effects. It is even possible that this large effect on global stability is responsible for the decrease in halothane binding affinity noted with this mutation. We have previously suggested that anesthetics exert their effects on proteins at the molecular level by regional specific binding and global alterations in conformational stability (11Eckenhoff R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 610-615PubMed Google Scholar, 12Eckenhoff R.G. Petersen C.E., Ha, C.E. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biol.

In agreement with the fluorescence results, the present hydrogen exchange results also indicated that halothane stabilizes almost all the charged to uncharged mutants better than wtHSA, except R257M. The lack of correlation between halothane stabilization (ΔΔG) and fluorescence quenching (IC50) with the various mutants most likely reflects that the W214 site is only one of many halothane binding sites in this protein (12Eckenhoff R.G. Petersen C.E., Ha, C.E. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30439-30444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol.

Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In summary, we used HSA and specific site-directed mutants as a native protein model to investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in halothane binding. Structural geometry analysis of the HSA-halothane complex predicted an absence of significant electrostatic interactions, and direct binding and stability experiments confirmed that loss of charge in the binding site generally increased halothane/HSA affinity. The results all point to the same conclusion: electrostatic (positive and negative) interactions either do not contribute to or diminish halothane binding to HSA, leaving only the more general hydrophobic and van der Waals forces as the major contributors to the binding interaction. An important implication of this study is that if HSA binding sites are similar to functionally relevant targets, then the likelihood of finding highly specific and selective inhalational anesthetic binding sites or targets is low.

Conversely, enhancement of inactivation caused by overexpression of β1γ2 subunits is eliminated upon knock-down of endogenous syntaxin or its scavenging at the plasma membrane. We further show that the N terminus of Kv1.1 binds brain synaptosomal and recombinant syntaxin 1A and concomitantly binds β1γ2; the binding of β1γ2 enhances that of syntaxin 1A.

Recently, we challenged the commonly accepted concept that presynaptic Kv channels participate in neurotransmitter release simply by virtue of their ability to shape action potentials that invade nerve terminals (2Meir A.

We demonstrated that the Kv channel composed of the pore forming Kv1.1 and auxiliary Kvβ subunits interact in fresh brain synaptosomes with syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin, and this interaction is relieved following triggering of transmitter release. Furthermore, in insulinoma HIT-T15 β cells the activity of Kv1.1 channel was inhibited by SNAP-25 (5Ji J. Tsuk S. Salapatek A.M. Huang X. Chikvashvili D. Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Sheu L. Tsushima R.

Also, we showed, inXenopus oocytes, that the direct interaction of the Kv1.1/Kvβ1.1 (αβ) channel with syntaxin 1A enhances the fast inactivation of the channel (4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y.

The reciprocal effects of α, syntaxin 1A, and SNAP-25 are reminiscent of the finding that presynaptic N- and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels interact directly with proteins of the exocytotic apparatus in neurons, and that their interaction with syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 causes feedback effects on the channel function in oocytes (reviewed in Ref. 7Catterall W.A.

Recent studies have shown that disruption of the interaction with syntaxin 1A in neurons has functional implications for transmitter release, reducing the efficacy of both Ca2+-dependent (7Catterall W.A.

Previous studies by our group have shown that the extent of inactivation depends on cellular mechanisms leading to phosphorylation (11Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B.

Furthermore, we identified G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) as the main regulators of the interaction with microfilaments and consequently as regulators of the extent of inactivation (13Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that the effect of syntaxin on the inactivation of the αβ channel requires the presence of Gβγ. Intriguingly, G-protein modulation of Ca2+ currents in nerve terminals was eliminated by cleavage of syntaxin (14Stanley E.F. Mirotznik R.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Also, a major part of syntaxin-induced inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channel expressed in HEK cells crucially depends on the presence of Gβγ, which tonically inhibits the Ca2+ channel (15Jarvis S.E. Magga J.M. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the finding of inter-relationships between syntaxin 1A and Gβγ interactions with a Kv channel points to further analogy with the interaction of the N-type Ca2+ channel with these proteins, suggesting a general complex pattern of regulation of the activity of presynaptic voltage-gated channels, which may be related to the fine-tuning of presynaptic activity.

Oocytes were injected (50 nl/oocyte) with 150−300 ng/μl Kv1.1 and 1−3 μg/μl Kvβ1.1 mRNAs for biochemical experiments, and with 5−10 ng/μl Kv1.1 and 15−1000 ng/μl Kvβ1.1 mRNAs for electrophysiological experiments. Gβ1, Gγ2, and c-βARK mRNAs (100 ng/μl each) were injected for both biochemical and electrophysiological experiments, 25 ng/μl syntaxin mRNA was injected for electrophysiological experiments and 25–100 ng/μl was injected for biochemical experiments. Dihydrocytochalasin B (DHCB; Sigma) treatment was done as described (11Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar): oocytes were incubated in 40–60 μm of the drug for several hours prior to electrophysiological assay. Stock solution of DHCB was made in ethanol (kept at −20 °C); control solutions always included 40–60 μm ethanol. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as described (19Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To avoid possible errors introduced by series resistance, only current amplitudes up to 4 μA were recorded. Currents were elicited by stepping up the membrane potential from a holding potential of −80 to +50 mV for 350 ms. Net current was obtained by subtracting the scaled leak current elicited by a voltage step from −80 to −90 mV. Oocytes with a leak current of more than 3 nA/1 mV were discarded. Oocytes were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (19Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For co-precipitation of Gβγ only, oocyte lysate was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the anti-α antibody followed by 30 min incubation with 30–40 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates from 1% Triton X-100 homogenates of either 5 oocytes or 20 plasma membranes (separated mechanically, as described in Ivanina et al. (29Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were separated by SDS−PAGE and either subjected to Western blot analysis using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) or digitized scans of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Met/Cys)-labeled proteins were derived by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and relative intensities were quantitated by ImageQuant (as described in Refs. 4Fili O.

Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were synthesized and reacted with syntaxin as described (4Fili O. Michaelevski I.

Briefly, purified GST fusion proteins (150 pmol) immobilized on glutathione−Sepharose beads were incubated with either 1–10 μl of lysate containing 35S-labeled Gβγ or syntaxin 1A (translated on the template of in vitrosynthesized RNAs using a translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions) or 200 pmol of recombinant syntaxin peptide in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, for 1 h at room temperature (except for Fig. 5 D, see legend), eluted with 15 mm reduced glutathione in 30 μl of elution buffer (120 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris−HCl, pH 8), and then subjected to SDS−PAGE. This was done as described (4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins (150 pmol) immobilized on glutathione−Sepharose beads were incubated with 150−200 μg of rat brain synaptosomes (P2 fraction; Ref. 20Pearce L.B. Buck T. Adamec E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 636-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), stored in aliquots at −70 °C, and thawed once) in HKA buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm K-acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA), with 2% CHAPS or 4% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 12 h. Samples were washed four times with HKA containing 0.1% Triton X-100, boiled for 10 min in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed (12% polyacrylamide gel), and subjected to Western blot analysis using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). ECL signals were quantified with TINA software (Budapest, Hungary). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to calculate the statistical significance of differences between two populations. Co-expression of α with β in oocytes injected with the corresponding mRNAs results in the formation of a heteromultimeric αβ channel that conveys a rapidly inactivating current with a fast inactivating component (I i) and a sustained, noninactivating component (I s) (see Fig.1 A). The extent of inactivation (the inactivating fraction) is defined asI i/I p (I p = peak current). Inactivation of the αβ current, but not the inactivation rate constant, depends on the level of β, which provides the “ball” for inactivation. The extent of inactivation increases up to saturation at I i/I p = 0.5−0.8 as the ratio of β-mRNA to α-mRNA injected into oocytes is increased to about 50:1 (depending on the batches of mRNAs and oocytes) (11Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As previously shown by our group (4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B), co-expression of either Gβ1γ2 (Gβγ) or syntaxin 1A (syntaxin) with the αβ channel (expressed from nonsaturating ratios of β-mRNA to α-mRNA, usually 5–10:1) increases the extent of fast inactivation. Conversely, scavenging of endogenous Gβγ by co-expression of the myristoylated C-terminal fragment of the cβARK1 (13Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reduces the extent of inactivation. Knock-down of endogenous syntaxin by an AS−ODN (termed AS-linker; Ref. 4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has a similar effect (Fig. 1 A and Ref. 4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further similarity between the functional effects of Gβγ and syntaxin was observed by examining the action of DHCB, a microfilament-disrupting agent previously shown to increase the extent of inactivation (11Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 C, the effect of treatment of oocytes with DHCB and the effect of syntaxin were additive when channels were expressed with nonsaturating β-mRNA to α-mRNA ratios (low β to α), whereas upon saturation with β (high β to α), which increased the inactivation, both effects were occluded. These results were similar to those obtained previously for the Gβγ effect (Ref. 13Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1 C, inset). The similarity between the functional interactions of Gβγ and syntaxin with the channel led us to examine the possibility of coupling between the effects of Gβγ and syntaxin. Fig. 1 D shows electrophysiological analysis of channels co-expressed with Gβγ, with syntaxin, or with both. The effects of Gβγ and syntaxin on the extent of inactivation are nonadditive (black bars), implying a possible convergence of signaling pathways. Moreover, injection of 30 pg of the anti-syntaxin AS linker into oocytes co-expressing the channel with Gβγ abolished the effect of Gβγ on inactivation. These results indicate that endogenous syntaxin is required for generation of the Gβγ effect. We then looked for symmetry by examining whether Gβγ is required for generation of the syntaxin effect. We analyzed the effect of co-expressed syntaxin in the absence or presence of co-expressed cβARK. cβARK abolished the effect of syntaxin on inactivation, indicating that endogenous Gβγ is needed for generation of the syntaxin effect (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, we addressed the question whether both Gβγ and syntaxin have to be present at the plasma membrane to jointly regulate the inactivation. We first considered the interaction between the channel and syntaxin. A previous study showed that the effect of co-expressed syntaxin requires the physical interaction of syntaxin with the functional channel (4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was achieved by taking advantage of the fact that the N718–963 (“synprint”) peptide, a Ca2+-channel domain (found to block co-immunoprecipitation of native N-type Ca2+ channels with syntaxin (21Sheng Z.H. Westenbroek R.E. Catterall W.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)) competed efficiently, in an in vitro binding assay, with the binding of syntaxin to the β subunit of the channel. Thus, by microinjection of this peptide into oocytes co-expressing syntaxin and the αβ channel, we were able to acutely reverse the effect of syntaxin on the channel. Because the synprint peptide was injected 20−60 min prior to the electrophysiological assay it could not affect significantly αβ synthesis or assembly in this time frame so that it must affect properties of plasma membrane channels. As a control we used the shorter N718–859 peptide, which did not compete for syntaxin binding and did not rescue the channel from the effect of syntaxin (Ref. 4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig. 2,inset). These results indicated that interaction of the channel with exogenous syntaxin, resulting in increased inactivation, occurs at the plasma membrane. In this study we further examined whether interaction of the channel with endogenous syntaxin, which is needed for increasing the extent of inactivation in oocytes co-expressing Gβγ, also occurs at the plasma membrane. To this end we tried to rescue the functional channel from the effect of Gβγ by injecting the synprint peptide into oocytes co-expressing Gβγ with the channel. We found that the increased inactivation by Gβγ was indeed acutely reversed by this peptide and not by the control peptide (Fig. 2, left panel). The effect of the synprint peptide in oocytes expressing αβ alone was statistically insignificant, however, when compared with the effect of the control peptide that enhanced inactivation, there was a clear reduction in inactivation, as was shown before (Ref. 4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig. 2, right panel). These results indicated that endogenous syntaxin (like exogenously expressed syntaxin) interacts with the functional channel at the plasma membrane to support the Gβγ effect. Next we considered the interaction between the channel and Gβγ. In a previous study (13Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we could not determine whether the effect of Gβγ requires interaction of Gβγ with functional channels at the plasma membrane, or if the interaction with the channel is limited to the biosynthesis and assembly phase at the endoplasmic reticulum. In an attempt to answer this question in this study we used phosducin, a cytoplasmic protein characterized by its ability to specifically bind Gβγ subunits with high affinity and to efficiently scavenge Gβγ (22Bauer P.H. Muller S. Puzicha M. Pippig S. Obermaier B. Helmreich E.J. Lohse M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We were able to show that microinjection of 1 μm(final concentration) recombinant phosducin (17Bluml K. Schnepp W. Schroder S. Beyermann M. Macias M. Oschkinat H. Lohse M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4908-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) into oocytes co-expressing Gβγ could acutely reverse the effect of Gβγ on the inactivation, whereas heat-denatured (2 h incubation at 65 °C) phosducin could not (Fig. 3, left panel). This indicated that exogenous Gβγ exerts its effect by interacting with the channel at the plasma membrane. We further showed that phosducin, but not the denatured phosducin, also reverses the increase in extent of inactivation in oocytes co-expressing syntaxin (Fig. 3, right panel), indicating that endogenous Gβγ also exerts its effect by interacting with the channel at the plasma membrane. Injection of either intact or denatured phosducin into oocytes expressing the channel alone increased the extent of inactivation. This effect, probably irrelevant to the ability of the channels to bind Gβγ, was manifested only with oocytes devoid of overexpressed Gβγ and could mask the effect relevant to the ability of phosducin to scavenge the endogenous Gβγ. Overall, these data are consistent with a mechanism by which the concomitant interaction of Gβγ and syntaxin with the functional channel enhances the extent of inactivation. Overexpression of at least one of these agents, syntaxin or Gβγ, is necessary to produce a maximal effect. The similarity and coupling between the functional effects of syntaxin and Gβγ with the αβ channel led us to compare their physical interactions with the channel. A previous study by our group (4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that syntaxin 1A associates with the αβ protein complex in brain synaptosomes and in a ∼1:1 stoichiometry with the αβ channel in plasma membranes of oocytes. We specifically characterized the interaction of β with syntaxin and showed that immobilized β−GST fusion protein could pull down syntaxin from synaptosomal lysates and bind recombinant syntaxin. Gβγ binds in vitro not only to β but also to the N terminus of α (13Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore, we examined the interaction of syntaxin with α. Toward this end three approaches were adopted. First, we performed a pull-down assay, using synaptosomal lysates and immobilized GST fusion proteins corresponding to the major intracellular parts of α. The following fusion proteins were constructed (Fig. 4 A): αC, the full-length C terminus of α; αN, the full-length N terminus of α; αT1“A” and αT1“B”, regions of the N terminus of α that participate in tetramerization of Kvα subunits (23Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 24Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Shen N.V. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); the latter also participates in Kvβ subunit binding. Two types of detergents were used, 2% CHAPS or 4% Triton X-100, to control for artifacts because of possible aggregations of proteins. The results of the two experimental conditions were similar. The pulled down syntaxin was visualized using Western blot analysis. Fig. 4 B shows one experiment (two left panels) and a summary of values obtained in five experiments (right panel) demonstrating that αN and αT1B but not αC or GST itself pulled down syntaxin. The second approach was an in vitro binding assay using the same immobilized GST fusion proteins and either the recombinant cytoplasmic part of syntaxin (see “Experimental Procedures”) or35S-labeled full-length syntaxin synthesized in reticulocyte lysate. The results of both settings were similar. Syntaxin interacted with the full-length N terminus of α and no interaction was detected with the full-length C terminus (Fig.4 C, middle panel). More specific analysis of this interaction showed that syntaxin bound to both the T1A and T1B domains, more strongly (by about 1.5-fold) to T1A (Fig. 4 C,left and right panels). It thus appears that syntaxin, similarly to Gβγ, interacts in vitro not only with β (4Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J.

Ischemia causes metabolic inhibition, and the use of metabolic inhibitors is one experimental method of simulating ischemia. The effects of metabolic inhibitors on the activity of inward rectifier K+ channels Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 were studied by heterologous expression inXenopus oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp. 10 μm carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) inhibited Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 currents but was without effect on Kir2.1 currents. The rate of decline of current in FCCP was faster for Kir2.3 than for Kir2.2. Kir2.3 was inhibited by 3 mm sodium azide (NaN3), whereas Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 were not. Kir2.2 was inhibited by 10 mmNaN3. All three of these inward rectifiers were inhibited by lowering the pH of the solution perfusing inside-out membrane patches. Kir2.3 was most sensitive to pH (pK = 6.9), whereas Kir2.1 was least sensitive (pK = 5.9). For Kir2.2 the pK was 6.2. These results demonstrate the differential sensitivity of these inward rectifiers to metabolic inhibition and internal pH.

The electrophysiological response of a particular cell type to ischemia may depend on the relative expression levels of different inward rectifier genes. carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Inward rectifier K+ channels are known to be involved in the electrophysiology of several different tissues, including the heart (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In fast response myocardial tissue they are responsible for the relatively negative value of the resting membrane potential and the late rapid repolarization phase of the action potential (2Lopatin A.N. Nichols C.G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 625-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Their characteristic property of inward rectification allows the myocardial cell to generate long lasting action potentials while minimizing ion fluxes (3Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001: 149-152Google Scholar). Ischemia produces electrophysiological changes that can lead to the generation of cardiac arrhythmias (4Carmeliet E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 917-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) or cerebral excitotoxicity (5Dirnagl U. Iadecola C. Moskowitz M.A. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Simulated ischemia has been shown to inhibit an inwardly rectifying current in isolated cardiac myocytes (6Henry P. Popescu A. Puceat M. Hinescu M.E. Escande D. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This effect may contribute to arrhythmogenesis and is therefore worthy of further study. Three closely related inward rectifier genes, Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3, are expressed in myocardium (7Liu G.X. Derst C. Schlichthorl G. Heinen S. Seebohm G. Bruggemann A. Kummer W. Veh R.W. Daut J.

These genes are also expressed in the brain (9Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 10Morishige K. Takahashi N. Jahangir A.

In this report we have simulated ischemia by applying metabolic inhibitors to Xenopus oocytes expressing these three inward rectifier K+ channels. We show that Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 are affected differently by metabolic inhibition. We also show that the sensitivity of Kir2.2 to internal pH is intermediate between that of Kir2.1 and Kir2.3.

Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Plasmids were linearized with NheI, and cRNA was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine, Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA yield and integrity were assessed by agarose-ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. Stage V–VI oocytes were surgically removed from Xenopus laevis frogs (Nasco) under anesthesia (0.03% benzocaine for 10–15 min) and incubated with 1.3 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington, type CLS3) for 2 h at 22 °C in 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with agitation to remove connective tissue. Oocytes were then washed several times with 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and stored in the same solution at 18 °C. Both solutions also contained 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 60 μg/ml ampicillin. Between 16 and 24 h later, oocytes were injected (Nanoliter; World Precision Instruments) with amounts of RNA that gave approximately equal expression levels (0.2 ng of Kir2.1, 4 ng of Kir2.2, and 4 ng of Kir2.3) in 50 nl of nuclease-free water. Inward rectifier currents were recorded 1–2 days after injection using a TEC-03 amplifier (npi, Germany) controlled by Pulse 8.4 software (Heka, Germany) via an ITC-16 computer interface (Instrutech, Long Island, NY). Currents were filtered at 500 Hz and digitized at 1 kHz. Data were analyzed using Pulse 8.4 and Prism 3.02 (GraphPad). Microelectrode pipettes had resistances of 0.5–1.5 megohms. Oocytes were placed in a 100-μl volume recording chamber that was continuously perfused at a rate of ∼1.2 ml/min. Different solutions entered the chamber via a common outlet with a dead space of ∼50 μl. Under control conditions oocytes were perfused with “90K” solution: 90 mmKCl/KOH, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Sodium azide (NaN3) and BaCl2 were dissolved in aliquots of this solution as solid. Carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)1 (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to 100 mm. This stock solution was diluted into 90K. Inward rectifier currents were recorded in “giant” inside-out patches from Xenopusoocytes (13Hilgemann D. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 307-327Crossref Google Scholar) 3–9 days after injection with Kir2.x RNA. The patch clamp amplifier was an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz, and data were acquired at 4.76 kHz with a Digidata 1320A computer interface and pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments). Data were analyzed using pClamp 8 and Prism 3.02 (GraphPad). Patch pipettes had inner tip diameters of 20–25 μm and contained a “FVPP” type solution (14Qu Z. Zhu G. Yang Z. Cui N., Li, Y.

The recording chamber contained this same solution. Inside-out patches were perfused with this solution and with aliquots of this solution that had been further adjusted to different pH values with HCl. Switching between different perfusion solutions was achieved with a BPS-8 valve control system and a QMM micromanifold with a dead space of ∼1 μl (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). The perfusion rate was 85 μl/min. Inward rectifier currents were monitored by means of a continuous two-electrode voltage clamp protocol. Membrane potential was held at 0 mV and at 20-s intervals was stepped to 50 mV for 75 ms and then to −50 mV for 350 ms. Expression of inward rectifier channels was confirmed by brief application of 20 mm Ba2+, which completely blocks Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 (9Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Oocytes were first perfused with 90K to ensure a steady current, and then the perfusion solution was switched to 90K plus 10 μm FCCP, which inhibits ATP production by dissipating the H+ gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (15Benz R. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1983; 41: 381-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). (This solution also contained 0.01% Me2SO. Me2SO alone had no effect on inward rectifier currents at this concentration.) In oocytes expressing Kir2.1, inward rectifier current remained steady in the presence of 10 μm FCCP. In contrast, 10 μm FCCP inhibited inward rectifier current in oocytes expressing Kir2.2 or Kir2.3. Examples of these experiments are shown in Fig.1. To rule out the unlikely possibility that the decline of Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 currents was because of spontaneous “rundown,” we perfused oocytes expressing these clones with 90K (plus 0.01% Me2SO) for prolonged periods without switching to FCCP. As shown by the examples in Fig. 2, spontaneous rundown did not occur. Indeed, in some cases (as in Fig. 2) the current had a tendency to slowly increase. This was not because of an increase in leak current, as demonstrated by applying 20 mmBa2+.Figure 2Examples of prolonged recordings of Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 currents in the continued presence of 90K (plus 0.01% Me2SO). The voltage clamp protocol was the same as in Fig. 1. The data in panel Arepresent the current recorded at −50 mV. The oocytes were briefly exposed to 20 mm Ba2+ at the times indicated.

The horizontal line indicates zero current level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the rate of decrease of inward rectifier currents in FCCP was quite slow, we chose an arbitrary time point of 15 min to compare the response of Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 to FCCP. Fig. 3 shows that there was a significant difference between Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 in terms of the fractional current remaining after 15 min of exposure to FCCP, demonstrating that the rate of Kir2.2 current decline was slower than that of Kir2.3. The fractional Kir2.2 current remaining after 15 min was significantly different from that of Kir2.1, which was unaffected by FCCP. In excised membrane patches, 10 μm FCCP was without effect on Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 (data not shown). To gain further evidence that the effect of FCCP was because of metabolic inhibition, we tested another metabolic inhibitor, sodium azide (NaN3) (16Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Tsubaki M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Voltage clamp experiments were carried out using the same protocol as that used for the FCCP experiments. As shown in Fig. 4, Kir2.3 currents decreased significantly during 15 min of exposure to 3 mm NaN3, whereas Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 currents were unaffected by this treatment. However, Kir2.2 currents were inhibited by 10 mm NaN3. It has been reported that metabolic inhibitors decrease intracellular pH (18Tromballa H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 636: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Maduh E.U. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1990; 106: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Kir2.3 is more sensitive than Kir2.1 to decreased intracellular pH (14Qu Z. Zhu G. Yang Z. Cui N., Li, Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13783-13789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore the sensitivity of Kir2.3 to metabolic inhibitors compared with Kir2.1 is consistent with a decrease in intracellular pH caused by metabolic inhibition. To investigate whether the intermediate sensitivity of Kir2.2 to metabolic inhibitors could be explained in terms of pH sensitivity, we compared the dose response of the three inward rectifiers to internal pH in inside-out membrane patches. As shown in Fig. 5, the sensitivity of Kir2.2 to decreasing pH was intermediate between that of Kir2.1 and Kir2.3. Acute ischemia produces many changes in the intracellular environment. These changes affect the activity of several different ion channels, leading to cellular electrophysiological alterations that can produce arrhythmias in the heart (4Carmeliet E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 917-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) or excitotoxicity in the brain (5Dirnagl U. Iadecola C. Moskowitz M.A. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Inward rectifier K+ channels play an important role in the electrophysiology of the cardiac myocyte (2Lopatin A.N. Nichols C.G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 625-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Shimoni Y. Clark R.B. Giles W.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 709-727Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and inhibition of their activity will have a significant and possibly arrhythmogenic effect (4Carmeliet E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 917-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Acute ischemia produces a shortening of the action potential because of activation of ATP-sensitive K+channels preceded in some cases by a lengthening. The lengthening has been attributed to inhibition of the transient outward current accompanied by inhibition of the inward rectifier current in some preparations (6Henry P. Popescu A. Puceat M. Hinescu M.E. Escande D. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but not others (21Verkerk A.O. Veldkamp M.W. van Ginneken A.C. Bouman L.N. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2443-2456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to determine the contribution of inward rectifier channels to changes in action potential duration during ischemia relative to other channel types. The results presented here suggest that the effect of ischemia on inward rectifier current will depend on the molecular identity of the channels. We have demonstrated that the inward rectifiers Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 are differentially sensitive to inhibition of cellular metabolism. Because cellular metabolism is inhibited in ischemia (4Carmeliet E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 917-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), our experimental conditions simulate some of the conditions prevailing during ischemia. Therefore it seems reasonable to propose that of these three related inward rectifiers Kir2.3 will be inhibited the most under ischemic conditions, whereas Kir2.1 will be inhibited the least. One of the intracellular changes that occurs during ischemia and metabolic inhibition is a decrease in pH (4Carmeliet E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 917-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 18Tromballa H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 636: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Maduh E.U. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1990; 106: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, the order of sensitivity of Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 to metabolic inhibition was the same as the order of sensitivity to lowering internal pH. However, the relative sensitivity to metabolic inhibition cannot be accounted for by a change in internal pH alone. For example, the degree of inhibition of Kir2.2 after 15 min of exposure to 10 μm FCCP (15%; Fig. 3,column 2) corresponds to an internal pH of 6.5 (Fig. 5 D), whereas the degree of inhibition of Kir2.3 after 15 min of exposure to 10 μm FCCP (38%; Fig. 3, column 3) corresponds to an internal pH of 7.0 (Fig. 5 D). Therefore our results suggest the influence of other intracellular consequences of metabolic inhibition. For example, metabolic inhibitors have been shown to deplete intracellular ATP in Xenopus oocytes (22Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. J Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Experimental data and simulations indicate that a change of a few nanosiemens in the K+ conductance of a cardiac myocyte can significantly affect action potential duration (23Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1675-H1686PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of only a fraction of the ≈150 nanosiemens inward rectifier conductance in the cardiac myocyte (24Sakmann B. Trube G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 347: 641-657Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar) may have a significant effect in ischemia. In the heart the inward rectifier current (I K1) is probably because of expression of both Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 with a small or no contribution from Kir2.3, depending on the species (7Liu G.X. Derst C. Schlichthorl G. Heinen S. Seebohm G. Bruggemann A. Kummer W. Veh R.W. Daut J. Preisig-Muller R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 532: 115-126Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Wang Z. Yue L. White M.

(Lond.). 2001; 533: 697-710Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, the relative functional expression levels of these different channels are not known accurately. Inward rectifier mRNA levels have been measured in human heart, but they may not reflect expression at the functional level (8Wang Z. Yue L. White M. Pelletier G. Nattel S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2422-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Differences in the relative expression levels of these genes in different anatomical locations in the heart may produce spatial disparities in the refractory period in response to ischemia. Such situations are proarrhythmic (4Carmeliet E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 917-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Details of the spatial distributions of inward rectifier gene expression in the heart are unknown at present. As an added complication, it is possible that Kir2.2 exists as a heteromultimer with Kir2.1 (25Zaritsky J.J. Redell J.B. Tempel B.L. Schwarz T.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 533: 697-710Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although Kir2.3 may not contribute much to I K1 in the heart, its location in neurons (26Stonehouse A.H. Pringle J.H. Norman R.I.

Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly evident that structural information is a prerequisite to formulate mechanisms of protein folding. One approach to obtain such information would be characterizing the structures of intermediate states populated in the equilibrium unfolding pathways of proteins (11Ptitsyn O.B. Adv.

NMR. 1994; 4: 741-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This exercise appears meaningful because residual structures in equilibrium intermediates are often related to that observed in kinetic intermediates (18Jennings P.A. Wright P.E.

The lack of evidence for a detectable intermediate in the folding/unfolding process is generally assumed to imply that the process is cooperative or two-state (native ↔ unfolded, Refs.21Jackson S.E.

Observation of same single exponential kinetics using two different spectroscopic probes, such as CD and fluorescence, is the usual criteria for a two-state process (24Bachmann A. Kiefhaber T. J.

However, it is well known that the conventional optical probes used are inadequate to detect small populations of intermediate states that exist at higher energy levels, which are swamped by signals from the abundant native state (27Bai Y.

Therefore, a detailed understanding of the stability and folding of hFGF-1 may help gain insights into the structural determinants in the folding of all β-trefoil proteins. In the present study, we investigate the stability of hFGF-1 by native state H/D exchange as a function of denaturant. The data obtained have allowed the local, subglobal, and global structures of hFGF-1 to be dissected. In addition, the results obtained indicate that the β-trefoil structure of hFGF-1 does not behave as a single cooperative unit. Heparin-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Labeled 15NH4Cl and 99.9% D2O were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. d4-urea was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals used were of high quality analytical grade. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Residues are numbered as per their position in the primary structure of the 154-amino acid hFGF-1. The expression vector for the truncated form of the hFGF-1 (residues 15–154) was constructed and inserted between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites in pET20b(+). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring pET20b(+)-hFGF-1 was cultured in minimal medium containing15NH4Cl. Recombinant protein was purified on heparin-Sepharose using gradient (0–1.5 m NaCl). Protein expression yields were in the range of 25–30 mg/liter. The extent of15N labeling was verified by electron spray mass analysis. Urea-induced unfolding of hFGF-1 was performed by fluorescence spectroscopy at 2.5 nm resolution using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (using a Hitachi F-2500 spectrofluorometer) and far-UV CD (at 228 nm) spectroscopy (using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter). All CD measurements were carried out using a quartz cell of 2 mm pathlength. 25 and 250 μg/ml hFGF-1 in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pD 6.1) in D2O containing 200 mm ammonium sulfate were used for the unfolding experiments monitored by fluorescence and far-UV CD, respectively. NMR sample of hFGF-1 contained ∼1.5 mm protein in 100 mm phosphate buffer and 200 mm ammonium sulfate in 90% H2O/10% D2O at pH 6.1.1H-15N HSQC spectra of hFGF-1 in 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0m urea were collected on a Bruker DMX600 spectrometer. Each spectrum was collected with 8 transients of 2,048 complex points and 64 t1 increments. Protein solution was prepared in 100 mm phosphate buffer and 200 mmammonium sulfate at pH 6.0 and pH 7.0. The sample was concentrated to ∼1.5 mm by ultrafiltration (Millipore) and dried by lyophilization. H/D exchange was initiated by dissolving dry protein in 10 mm phosphate-buffered D2O containing appropriate concentrations of d4-urea (0–1 md4-urea at 0.1 m interval). The maximum shift observed in pD values upon addition of urea was about 0.3 unit (in this and all other experiments, pD of denaturated solutions has been corrected for the effect of glass electrode) at 25 °C. All NMR data acquisition parameters were preset using a mock sample, and sample pH was measured after the experiment to minimize the dead time. The first1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired after 6–10 min of initiation of exchange. Spectra were recorded with 8 transients of 2,048 data points and 64 t1 increments. 50 spectra were collected in 48 h, and another 6–8 spectra (beyond 48 h) were collected at appropriate time points. The peak heights in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured using the peak picking subroutine and referenced internally to a nonexchangeable resonance aliphatic proton in one-dimensional1H spectra. To determine rate constants for exchange, NH resonance intensities (I) as a function of time (t) were fit to a single exponential function, I = Ioexp(−k ex t) + C, where Io is the initial intensity, k ex is the rate constant of exchange, and C is final amplitude. The protection factor (P) for the various amide protons in the protein was estimated using the equation P =k rc/k ex, wherek rc and k ex represent the exchange rates of the protein in the random coil and native states, respectively. The H/D exchange rates of amide protons in nonstructured peptides termed k rc are estimated by referencing an alanine-based peptide (poly-dl-alanine) at low ionic strengths at 20 °C. The free energy of exchange of the amide protons was calculated from the equation ΔGex = −RTln(k ex/k rc), where R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature at which the exchange was monitored. The dependence of unfolding free energy on urea concentration is expressed as the equation ΔGex(den) = ΔGex(0) − m[urea], where ΔGex(den) is the Gibbs free energy of H/D exchange for each amide proton at various concentrations of denaturant (urea), ΔGex(0) is the stabilization free energy at zero denaturant concentration, and the slope, m, depends on the denaturant binding surface newly exposed in the unfolding reaction. Them value for each residue was obtained by fitting the linear part of the plot of ΔGex(den) as a function of the urea concentration. The thermodynamic stability of hFGF-1 (in D2O) using urea denaturation curves is monitored by steady state fluorescence (based on 350/308 nm fluorescence changes) and far-UV circular dichroism (using ellipticity changes at 228 nm) spectroscopy. The urea-induced unfolding of hFGF-1 at pD 6.0 is completely reversible. The unfolding of hFGF-1 monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy shows that the protein unfolds completely beyond 4.0m urea (Fig. 2). TheC m (concentration of urea at which 50% of the molecules exist in the unfolded state(s)) and m (a measure of the cooperativity of the unfolding reaction) are estimated to be 2.79 ± 0.07 m and 1.80 ± 0.02 kcal·mol−1·m−1, respectively. The free energy difference (ΔG(D2O)) between the folded and unfolded states of hFGF-1 in D2O is 5.00 ± 0.09 kcal·mol−1. Within experimental error(s), the unfolding profile of hFGF-1 monitored by fluorescence and the ellipticity change at 228 nm superimpose quite well, implying that the denaturation of the protein is a cooperative process without the accumulation of stable equilibrium intermediate(s) (Fig. 2). We recently investigated the chronology of events in the refolding pathway of hFGF-1 from its urea-unfolded state(s) (50Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Balamurugam K. Lin W.Y. Chin D.H. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4134-4141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Chevron plot (natural logarithm of the unfolding/refolding rate constant versus the denaturant concentration) shows a prominent curvature at low concentrations of urea (Fig. 3). In general, a deviation from linearity (“roll over”) is an indication of the accumulation of intermediate species at low denaturant concentrations. These results suggest that although intermediates are not detected under equilibrium conditions, the refolding of hFGF-1 appears to proceed via the formation of kinetic intermediates.Figure 3Chevron plot of hFGF-1. The roll over in the folding limb indicates that the refolding of the protein proceeds via the accumulation of kinetic intermediates (Ref. 50Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Balamurugam K. Lin W.Y. Chin D.H.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Native state H/D exchange monitored by NMR spectroscopy could help in distinguishing regions of differing stability (in proteins) and consequently yield information about the structural transitions occurring within the population of protein molecules (34Bai Y. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1996; 24: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35Englander S.W. Krishna M.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 741-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is in this context that we monitored the H/D exchange of hFGF-1 by acquiring a series of1H-15N HSQC spectra (at various time periods) in the absence and presence of subdenaturing amounts of urea. The1H-15N HSQC spectrum of hFGF-1 is well dispersed, and all the cross-peaks in the spectrum have been unambiguously assigned (Fig.4 A). The H/D exchange rates of 74 of 120 amide protons in hFGF-1 could be measured at pD 6.0 at 25 °C. 46 main-chain amide protons exchange out within dead time of measurement (20 min), and most of them correspond to residues located in the unstructured regions of the hFGF-1 molecule (TableI). In all, 11 residues exchange very fast, with rate constants (k ex) greater than 1 × 10−2 min−1. 37 residues mostly belonging to β-strands III, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI exhibit moderately fast exchange rates (2 × 10−4min−1 < k ex < 1 × 10−2 min−1). Eight residues including Arg38, Ile39, and Leu40 (located in β-strand II), Tyr78, Leu79, and Ala80 (constituting β-strand VI), Leu86 (in β-strand VII), and Leu100 (in β-strand VIII) are strongly protected (k ex < 7 × 10−5 min−1) from exchange (Table I). In particular, Ala80 shows the largest protection factor (Fig.4 B, P = 1.45 × 106). The amide proton of Ala80 is involved in hydrogen bond with Tyr88 located in β-strand VII. This hydrogen bond favors the development of a hydrophobic cluster comprised of residues in β-strands VI and VII. The amide proton of Ala80 is located in the middle of the non-polar cluster and hence is protected from solvent exchange.Table IHydrogen-deuterium exchange patterns of residues in hFGF-1Rate constant (k ex) rangeResiduesk ex< 7 × 10−5 min−1R38, I39, L40, Y78, L79, A80, L86, L1007 × 10−5 min−1 <k ex < 2 × 10−4 min−1L28, L37, L58, V68, Y69, I70, S72, D82, G85, F99, I112, F122, V123, A143, I144, L145, F146, L1472 × 10−4 min−1 <k ex < 1 × 10−2 min−1K26, C30, N32, F36, G43, T44, V45, D46, G47, T48, I56, Q57, Q59, E67, K71, L87, Y88, G89, S90, C97, L98, E101, R102, N109, T110, Y111, S113, K114, W121, G124, L125, K126, S130, K132, G134, R136, L149k ex > 1 × 10−2min−1H35, D53, H55, Q77, S61, D84, E104, Y108, G129, T137, V151Residues that disappeared in the first 20 min of exchangeK24, S31, G33, G34, D42, R49, R51, S52, Q54, L60, E63, S64, V65, G66, T73, E74, T75, G76, M81, T83, Q91, T92, N94, E95, E96, L103, E105, N106, H107, K115, H116, A117, E118, K119, N120, K127, N128, C131, R133, H138, Y139, G140, K142, S152, S153, D154 Open table in a new tab There are prominent differences in the average protection factors of the various β-strands constituting the structure of hFGF-1. Among the 12 β-strands in hFGF-1, β-strands IV and XI exhibit the least average protection factor values (Fig.5). The higher susceptibility of residues in β-strand XI (to H/D exchange) is consistent with the solution structure of hFGF-1 determined by NMR spectroscopy. The β-trefoil structure of hFGF-1 in solution is shown to contain only 11 β-strands (45Ogura K. Nagata H. Habushi H. Kimata K. Tate S. Ravera M.W. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), instead of the 12 β-strands depicted in the crystal structure (44Blaber M. Disalvo J. Thomas K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The observed discrepancy between the solution and crystal structures could be attributed to the higher flexibility of residues in β-strand XI in solution, which precludes the observation of intramolecular nuclear Overhauser effects characterizing β-strand XI (45Ogura K. Nagata H. Habushi H. Kimata K. Tate S. Ravera M.W. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 15N chemical shift perturbation data obtained upon titration of hFGF-1 with structural analogs of heparin have shown that residues in β-strand XI are involved in the heparin binding site (46Chi Y.H. Kumar T.K.S. Chiu I.M. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39444-39450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It appears that the higher flexibility of residues in β-strand XI possibly favors complex formation with the proteoglycan (heparin sulfate) by lowering the free energy barrier. Similarly, higher flexibility of residues in β-strand IV (as indicated by the low average protection factor value) also appears to bear physiological relevance. Crystal structure of fibroblast growth factor receptor-ligand (fibroblast growth factor 1) complex reveals that residues in β-strand IV interact with the D2 extracellular domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (55Stauber D.J. Digabriele A.D. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The higher flexibility of residues in β-strand IV possibly increases the solvent-accessible surface area (in this portion of hFGF-1 molecule) and consequently enhances the probability of binding and optimization (decrease in the free energy of interaction) of the ligand to the receptor. β-Strands II and VI exhibit significantly large average protection factor values (Fig. 5). Residues in β-strand VI are lodged in a hydrophobic core that is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Ala80NH and Tyr88CO. The dense hydrophobic cluster formed by residues in β-strand VI insulates their amide protons from solvent exchange. Similarly, the high average protection factor of β-strand II primarily stems from the network of hydrogen bonds between Leu37NH and Leu28CO and between Leu149NH and Leu27CO. These hydrogen bonds forge a hydrophobic cluster consisting of Leu27, Leu28, Tyr29, Phe36, Leu37, Ile39, Leu147, and Leu149. The results discussed so far clearly suggest that the 12 β-strands do not contribute equally toward the structural stability of hFGF-1. Residues in β-strands II and VI appear to constitute the stable core of the protein. EX2 is generally the dominating exchange mechanism for backbone amide protons in proteins. However, under extreme pH or temperature conditions or in the presence of high denaturant concentrations, the H/D exchange is dominated by the EX1 mechanism (32Arrington C.B. Robertson A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A direct test of the EX2 condition is to vary the pH at which exchange is carried out and confirm that the change in observed H/D exchange rate is as predicted by the corresponding change ink rc (34Bai Y. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1996; 24: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Such a test was carried in hFGF-1 at two pH conditions (pD 6.0 and 7.0). Logarithms of amide proton exchange rates obtained at pD 6.0 and 7.0 showed a linear correlation (slope, ∼0.9) with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 (data not shown), thus validating the assumption that H/D exchange in hFGF-1 under the given conditions (between pD 6.0 and 7.0) occurs predominately by the EX2 mechanism. The effect of urea on1H-15N HSQC spectra of hFGF-1 is monitored at concentrations of the denaturant at or below 2.0 m urea (Fig. 6). However, to avoid errors arising due to viscosity effect(s) on hydrogen exchange rates, ΔGex (free energy of exchange) of various amide protons was estimated from the H/D exchange data acquired at or below 1.0m urea. We could unambiguously monitor the H/D exchange of 74 backbone amide protons (of 120 total backbone amide protons) in the protein. We could not reliably monitor the H/D exchange of hFGF-1 beyond 2.0 m urea because the1H-15N spectra begin to collapse, presumably due to significant interconversion of the folded and unfolded states of the protein. The framework within which to relate dependence of H/D exchange rates to the nature of physical motions of the protein underlying the H/D exchange event is well established (27Bai Y. Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Science. 1995; 29: 192-197Crossref Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 34Bai Y. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1996; 24: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 37Chamberlain A.K. Handel T.M. Marqusee S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The denaturant exchange rate is proposed to be directly related to the stabilization of the exchange-competent state relative to the native (exchange incompetent) state by increase in the accessible surface area available for binding of the denaturant. The relationship between unfolding free energy change and the denaturant concentration is linear (ΔGex(den) = ΔGex(0) −m(den)) (56Pace C.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 3: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 57Schellman J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and the slope m depends on the denaturant binding surface newly exposed to the unfolding reaction and is reflected in the exchange behavior of the slowly exchanging hydrogen. Thus, different physical motions leading to H/D exchange-competent states would lead to states that result in different associated changes in the accessible surface area. Because them value is a measure of the degree of denaturant-accessible surface area, an estimation of this parameter is expected to provide information on the"

In studies of RARs in breast cancer, there are striking differences in the expression of certain protein isoforms of the RARβ gene between cells derived from normal human mammary glands and those derived from breast tumors. While the protein isoforms RARβ2 and RARβ4 consist of the longest open reading frames of the RARβ2 and RARβ4 mRNAs, respectively, we find that a fraction of scanning ribosomes bypass these upstream RARβ2 and RARβ4 protein start codons and initiate translation downstream. This downstream translation initiation site is identical in the RARβ2 and RARβ4 transcripts and generates a third RARβ protein isoform, here termed RARβ′ (formerly human RARβ4). RARβ′ lacks protein domains found in the N terminus of RARβ2 and RARβ4, including one of two zinc fingers required for DNA binding. However, RARβ′ retains the ability to heterodimerize with RXRα and interact with transcription cofactors. In reporter gene assays, RARβ′ repressed retinoic acid-activated transcription of co-transfected RARβ2, RARβ4, and RARα. This repression required the presence of acidic amino acids within the AF2 domain. These findings demonstrate an antagonistic role for RARβ′ in signaling by retinoic acid.

Vitamin A derivatives, called retinoids, are required for epithelial cell development and differentiation. Retinoid signals are transduced largely through ligand activation of two families of retinoid-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, retinoic acid receptors (RARs) 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; atRA, all-trans retinoic acid; AF2, activation function domain 2; HMEC, human mammary epithelial cells; RARE, retinoic acid response element; RXR, retinoid X receptor; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PBS-T, phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20. and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Receptors of both the RAR and RXR subfamilies share conserved protein regions designated A through F. The A and B regions include a ligand-independent transactivation domain (AF-1) whereas region C encompasses the DNA-binding domain. The D region acts as a conformational hinge between the DNA-binding domain and the remainder of the protein. The ligand binding, dimerization, and ligand-dependent transactivation (AF-2) domains are all found within regions E and F. RAR-RXR heterodimers bind tocis-acting DNA elements in gene promoter regions called retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) and transactivate target genes in the presence of a retinoid ligand. Both the RAR and RXR families are comprised of three genes (α, β, and γ) that generate multiple isoforms via the usage of two promoters, P1 and P2, and alternative splicing (1Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). As the primary effectors of retinoid signaling, the RARs and RXRs themselves appear to be targets for disruption in tumorigenesis (2Xu X.C. Lotan R. Nau H. Blaner W.S.

Further evidence of RARβ suppression of tumor cell proliferation comes from cell culture studies, where ectopic expression of the RARβ2 isoform resulted in decreased proliferation of tumor cells lines derived from the breast (19Liu Y.

In the mouse, the RARβ gene generates four distinct transcripts: splice variants RARβ1 and RARβ3 from transcription at promoter P1, and RARβ2 and RARβ4 from the RARE-containing P2 promoter (26Nagpal S. Zelent A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Kastner P. Krust A. Garnier J.M. Ruffenach F. Leroy P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In the human, only RARβ2 and RARβ4 transcripts have been identified in normal adult cells (28de The H. Marchio A. Tiollais P. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Human RARβ1 is expressed in fetal tissues and some small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (29Houle B. Pelletier M., Wu, J. Goodyer C. Bradley W.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a human homologue of the RARβ3 isoform has not been detected. The RARβ2 and RARβ4 transcripts differ only in the content of their 5′-most exon (exon 5 relative to the entireRARβ gene), a result of alternative splicing (26Nagpal S. Zelent A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). RARβ4 lacks 357 nucleosides encoded by this exon that are present in the RARβ2 mRNA, including the translation initiation site for the RARβ2 protein. We have previously reported several unique findings regarding RARβ expression in cultured cells derived from normal and neoplastic mammary epithelium. Only two mRNA products of the RARβ gene (RARβ2 and RARβ4) had been detected in these cells by Northern blot analyses (30Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Lee X. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Sager R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 133-141PubMed Google Scholar), and these transcripts were expressed at low levels in most breast tumor cell lines compared with human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) isolated from normal breast tissue. However, the levels of RARβ protein in these cells could not be predicted on the basis of their transcript levels. Some cell lines with abundant RARβ2 and RARβ4 mRNAs expressed low levels of RARβ protein. Conversely, other cells, such as the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, expressed high levels of RARβ protein with very low transcript levels by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. We also noted the presence of three distinct RARβ protein species in these cell lines, although only two RARβ transcripts were present. Finally, we observed differential expression of these RARβ protein isoforms in cells derived from normal breast tissue compared with those from neoplastic mammary tissue (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, we introduced mutations into RARβ2 and RARβ4 5′ transcript leader sequences to determine which candidate codons operate to initiate protein synthesis within the cell. We performed a functional characterization of the protein generated from a downstream initiation codon of both the RARβ2 and RARβ4 transcripts, RARβ′, to determine its ability to bind a RARE, heterodimerize, and interact with transcription cofactors. We then tested the effect of this protein on retinoid-activated transcription in transient transfection assays. Our studies show distinct and opposing functions for RARβ2 and RARβ4 compared with RARβ′, and we propose that RARβ′ acts as an inhibitor of transcriptional activation mediated by RARs. To synthesize expression constructs of RARβ2 or RARβ4 transcripts including all nucleosides from +1 throughout the coding region, the promoter construct pβ2-747luc (32Si S.P. Lee X. Tsou H.C. Buchsbaum R. Tibaduiza E. Peacocke M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified between +1 and +155 (HindIII/RARβ forward primer, 5′-GAT AAG CTT GTG ACA GAA GTA GTA GGA AGT-3′, HindIII site in bold; reverse primer, 5′-AGT GGA TCC TAC CCC GAC GGT GCC CAG AC-3′). Following digestion withHindIII and BamHI, the amplicon was ligated into the HindIII and BamHI sites of the pBluescript II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resulting plasmid was linearized with BamHI digestion. RARβ2 and RARβ4 cDNA fragments from +155 through +2107 or +155 through +1750, respectively, were obtained by the digestion of pCR(RARβ2) and pCR(RARβ4) (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with BamHI. These RARβ fragments were ligated into the linearized plasmid described above to obtain plasmids pBS(RARβ2) and pBS(RARβ4). For translation studies, RARβ cDNAs were cloned into the first polylinker of vector pCS2+MT (33Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) to achieve read-through translation of 6 Myc epitopes at the protein C terminus. pCS2+MT was first modified to contain a SmaI site by the insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide (top, 5′-GAT CCA GAT CTA CTG CAG ATC CCG GGT CAT-3′; bottom, 5′-CGA TGA CCC GGG ATC TGC AGT AGA TCT G-3′;SmaI sites in bold) between the vector BamHI andClaI sites. This modified vector was then digested withHindIII and SmaI for the following cloning steps. Plasmids pCS(RARβ2) and pCS(RARβ4), which contain nucleotides corresponding to +1 of the transcript through the entire RARβ2 or RARβ4 coding sequence (excluding the stop codon) were created by PCR amplification of pBS(RARβ2) or pBS(RARβ4) with primers containing either a HindIII site (HindIII/RARβ forward primer) or an XbaI site (reverse primer, 5′-CCCTCTAGATTGCACGAGTGGTGACTG-3′; XbaI site in bold). All PCR amplifications were performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cycled using parameters detailed previously (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Amplicons were digested withXbaI followed by a Klenow fill-in reaction and then subsequently digested with HindIII. The resulting fragments were ligated into the digested pCS2+MT vector. A series of constructs derived from plasmids pCS(RARβ2) and pCS(RARβ4) were created with point mutations at putative translation initiation sites to either eliminate or to enhance ribosomal recognition as translation initiation sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to directions.

A fragment containing the RARβ2 coding sequence was amplified from plasmid pCS(RARβ2 T2−) (see TableI) using forward primer BamHI-RARβ2 (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K.

Following BamHI digestion, the insert was ligated into the BamHI site of pTag to create pTag(RARβ2/stop). Forward primerBamHI-mut-RARβ4 259 (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RARβ′ protein coding sequence was amplified from pCS(RARβ2) with forward primer (5′-CCTGGATCCCAGAAGAATATGGTTTACACTTGTC-3′, BamHI site in bold) and reverse primer 3′NotI RP. Following digestion with BamHI and NotI, agarose gel-purified RARβ4 and RARβ′ coding sequences were ligated into theBamHI and NotI sites of pTag, generating plasmids pTag(RARβ4/stop) and pTag(RARβ′/stop), respectively. pTag(RARβ2ΔAF2) was constructed by PCR amplification of pSP(RARβ2ΔAF2) (see below) with primers BamHI-RARβ2 and 3′BamHI RP, followed by BamHI digestion and ligation into the BamHI site of pTag. pTag(RARβ′ΔAF2) was created by PCR amplification of pSP(RARβ′ΔAF2) (below) using primers PstI-RARβ′ FP (5′-CCACTGCAGAAGAATATGATTTACACTTGTCACC-3′, PstI site in bold)and 3′NotI RP, followed by PstI andNotI digestion and ligation into the PstI andNotI sites of pTag. For translation in vitro of a C-terminal-truncated RARβ2 isoform, plasmid pSP(RARβ2) was PCR-amplified with forward primerBamHI-RARβ2 (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the following reverse primer with an added SacI site (in bold): 5′-GAGCTCTTAATTCTTCTGAATACTTCTGCGG-3′. The amplicon was gel purified and ligated into the BamHI and SacI sites of pSP64 (Promega, Madison, WI) to create plasmid pSP(RARβ2N). Three mutations were introduced into the coding sequence of both RARβ2 and RARβ′ by site-directed mutagenesis of plasmids pSP(RARβ2) and pSP(RARβ4 448) (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to replace codons for three glutamic acid residues in the AF2 domain with those encoding neutral amino acids alanine and valine (Fig. 8 A). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit as described by the manufacturer and resulted in plasmids pSP(RARβ2ΔAF2) and pSP(RARβ′ΔAF2). For pSP(RXRα), pL(RXRαSN) (34Robertson K.A. Emami B. Mueller L. Collins S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3743-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a gift from Steven Collins, was amplified (forward primer, 5′-GAATTCGTCGCAGACATGGACACCAAACATTTCC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-TCTAGACCCGCAGGCCTAAGTCATTTGGTGCGG-3′;EcoRI and XbaI digestion sites in bold, respectively), followed by EcoRI digestion, Klenow fill-in,XbaI digestion, and ligation into the HindIII (blunted by Klenow) and XbaI sites of pSP64. For bacterial expression of N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, pL(RXRαSN) was digested with EcoRI. The fragment containing the RXRα coding sequence was purified and then ligated into the EcoRI site of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) to make pGEX(RXRα). Plasmids GST(C-SMRT) and pGEX6P(AIB1.T1) were provided by Ronald Evans (35Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) and Paul Meltzer (36Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), respectively. Double-stranded, synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides −83 to −37 of the RARβ2 promoter (5′-ggg tca TTT GAa ggt taG CAG CCC GGG TAG GGT TCA CCG AAA GTT CA-3′; RARE in bold, non-consensus RARE in lowercase) were ligated into a BglII- and NheI-digested pGL-Promoter (Promega) to give pGL(βRARE), a retinoic acid-responsive reporter construct for use in the luciferase assays. All plasmid constructs described above were verified by automated sequence analysis. The AG11132 human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) strain was obtained from the Coriell Institute (National Institutes of Aging Repository, Camden, NJ). MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). AG11132 and MCF-7 cells were cultured as previously described (37Swisshelm K. Machl A. Planitzer S. Robertson R. Kubbies M. Hosier S. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 226: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For expression of Myc-tagged proteins, 1.0 × 106AG11132 or MCF-7 cells were plated in 60-mm2 dishes. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 10 μg of one of the above pCS plasmids using 20 μl of SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were scraped in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min and supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C for Western blot analysis. For luciferase assays, MCF-7 cells were plated in 24-well plates at 70,000 or 100,000 cells/well. The cells were transfected with a total of 0.24–0.27 μg DNA per well using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) in medium containing 5% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The amount of DNA per transfection was equalized using the pTag vector. The transfection control plasmid pRL (Renilla luciferase) was co-transfected at one-tenth the amount of pGL(βRARE). Twenty-four hours following transfection, 0.1% ethanol or all-transretinoic acid (atRA) (to final concentrations of 0.01 or 1 μm) was added. After another 24 h, the cells were lysed in 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and immediately assayed for luciferase activity or stored at −20 °C. 12 μl of each cell lysate from MCF-7 and AG11132 cells transfected with pCS-derived plasmids (above) were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in 1% milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (1:200 in PBS-T) produced as a medium supernatant from the Myc1–9E10.2 hybridoma line (38Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing in PBS-T, membranes were incubated 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:20,000 in PBS-T; Pierce, Rockford, IL), re-washed in PBS-T, then incubated 5 min at room temperature in SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), followed by autoradiography. 1 μg of plasmid pSP(RARβ2), pSP(RARβ4 259mut) (coding sequence corresponds to RARβ4), pSP(RARβ4 448) (coding sequence corresponds to RARβ′) (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), pSP(RARβ2ΔAF2), pSP(RARβ′ΔAF2), or pSP(RXRα) was incubated with 50 μl of TnT Quick Master Mix (Promega) and either 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Science Products) or 20 μm methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Translated products were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. BL21 cells (Amersham Biosciences) were transformed with pGEX constructs described above. Purification of GST fusion proteins was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) conjugated with GST(AIB1.TI), GST(C-SMRT), or GST-RXRα were incubated with 0.1% ethanol or 1 μm atRA and 3 μl of in vitrotranslated [35S]methionine-labeled RARβ proteins (pre-incubated with 0.1% ethanol or 50 μm atRA for 1 h on ice) in binding buffer (60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% IGEPAL, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, 8% glycerol). Mixtures were incubated on ice for 2 h and then washed with NENT buffer (same as the binding buffer, except with 500 mm NaCl). After elution in 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), complexes were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Approximately 0.1–0.5 μl of in vitro translated RARβ2, RARβ4, RARβ′, RARβ2ΔAF2, RARβ′ΔAF2, or RXRα were incubated in binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) overnight on ice at 4 °C. The following day, 50,000–80,000 cpm of 32P-end-labeled, double-stranded RARE (top strand, 5′-GGG TAG GGT TCA CCG AAA GTT CAC TCG-3′) were added, and the resulting mixture was incubated on ice for 15–20 min. Complexes were separated on 5.5% non-denaturing acrylamide gels. For supershift assays, 1 μg of RARβ or RXRα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was included in the overnight incubation at 4 °C. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured on a Zylux FB15 luminometer (Zylux Corp., Maryville, TN) using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). For each experiment, duplicate transfections were assayed. Firefly relative light units were divided by Renillarelative light units and normalized to vector control (without addition of atRA). The average of the 2–3 experiments was calculated, and statistical significance was determined using the two-tailed Student'st test for samples with equal variance. Statistical analyses compared the relative luciferase activity obtained for samples with an added component, such as a cofactor, with those obtained for identical samples without the added component. We have previously reported the expression of three discrete RARβ protein isoforms in HMECs and breast tumor cells that express only two RARβ mRNAs (RARβ2 and RARβ4) (Fig.1) (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that at least one of the RARβ transcripts directs the synthesis of multiple proteins by the mechanism of leaky scanning (39Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 40Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids pCS(RARβ2) and pCS(RARβ4) were created containing the entire transcript leader region and coding sequence of each transcript cloned in-frame to six C-terminal Myc epitopes (Fig.2 A). These plasmids were transiently transfected into both HMECs (AG11132) and MCF-7 cells, and soluble protein extracts were analyzed by Western blots using an antibody raised against the Myc epitope. We found that the pCS(RARβ2) and pCS(RARβ4) transcripts each generated two proteins in both cell lines assayed (Fig. 2 B). The apparent masses of these proteins were comparable to the endogenous RARβ proteins when the ∼14-kDa tag at the C terminus of the ectopically expressed proteins is accounted for. Note that in vitro translated proteins generated from each of these putative translation start sites migrated in SDS-PAGE with one of the three endogenous RARβ proteins found in HMECs or MCF-7 cells (31Sommer K.M. Chen L.I. Treuting P.M. Smith L.T. Swisshelm K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The lowest molecular weight protein appeared to be common to both transcripts, whereas the higher molecular weight protein made by pCS(RARβ4) and pCS(RARβ2) transcripts were dissimilar in size (Fig. 2 B). For the RARβ4-derived transcript, the lower molecular weight protein was expressed at higher levels than that of the larger protein in MCF-7 cells, and at approximately equivalent amounts in the HMEC lysates (Fig. 2,B and C). The higher molecular weight protein was the predominant protein generated from the RARβ2-derived transcript in both MCF-7 cells and HMECs (Fig. 2, B and C). In identical experiments, these patterns of protein expression directed by transiently transfected pCS(RARβ2) and pCS(RARβ4) plasmids into MCF-7 cells were replicated in two other breast tumor cell lines, MDA-MB-231"

Here, we present a cellular system designed to biochemically dissect signals elicited upon pre-TCR expression. Using the T cell line 4G4 stably transfected with one of the two known pTα isoforms or selective pTα deletion mutants and TCRβ, we were able to observe that expression of a functional pre-TCR complex is sufficient to control the levels of surface Fas protein, the stimulation of mitogen-activated and stress-regulated kinases, and the activation status of the p53 antioncogene. We demonstrate that this regulation has a major impact on the expression of important regulators of apoptosis, such as Bcl-2 family members, and the cell cycle, such as p21WAF. Furthermore, we show here that cells expressing a functional pre-TCR are more resistant to different types of DNA damage-induced apoptosis and that these effects are contingent on an intact cytoplasmic tail of pTα. We finally propose that the presence of a functional pre-TCR complex triggers many intracellular pathways capable of driving and ensuring thymocyte survival in the presence of DNA damage.

The most immature thymocytes are double negative (DN) for CD4 and CD8 expression and progress through four subsets defined by CD44 and CD25 expression: DN I (CD25− CD44+), DN II (CD25+CD44+), DN III (CD25+ CD44lo), and DN IV (CD25loCD44lo) (6Godfrey D.I. Kennedy J. Suda T. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). From these arise CD25loCD44lo CD3loCD4− CD8+ immature single positive cells that develop into cells double positive (DP) for CD4 and CD8 expression (7Takahama Y. Singer A. Science. 1992; 258: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), from which mature TCRαβ(+) thymocytes are selected. The major changes associated with TCRβ gene rearrangement occur at the transition from DN III to DN IV cells, precisely when the pre-TCR is expressed. However, whether the presence of pre-TCR is sufficient to induce the concomitant occurrence of these many events remains still an unresolved matter. Like TCRαβ, the pre-TCR is a multicomponent signaling complex comprising a TCRβ chain paired with at least one of two isoforms of a pTα molecule both associated with CD3 chains, specifically ε, either γ or δ, and to some extent ζ (8Saint-Ruf C.

Hayday A.C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The pre-TCR spontaneously clusters and associates with signaling molecules such as p56lck, CD3 molecules, and zap-70 via sequestration in lipid rafts even in the absence of any extracellular ligand (14Saint-Ruf C. Panigada M. Azogui O. Debey P. von Boehmer H. Grassi F. Nature. 2000; 406: 521-527Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that the main role for the pre-TCR is to facilitate pairing with the CD3 complex. However, unlike TCRαβ, the pre-TCR has an additionally extended cytoplasmic tail encoded by the pTα gene. Within the tail two proline-rich motifs can be identified by sequence similarity to motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of human CD2 that mediate binding to CD2BP2, an adaptor molecule involved in intracellular signaling (8Saint-Ruf C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24249-24257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Heretofore, the importance of the intracytoplasmic region of the pre-TCR has been uncertain, but very recently the expression of pTα mutants in retrovirally transduced T cell precursors and cell lines showed that the pTα cytoplasmic tail, in particular the proline-rich domain, plays a crucial role in pre-TCR signal transduction (17Aifantis I. Borowski C. Gounari F. Lacorazza H.D. Nikolich-Zugich J. von Boehmer H. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on the analysis of cells on either side of the DN III to DN IV transition, the pre-TCR has been hypothesized to regulate thymocyte survival, proliferation, differentiation, and lineage commitment (18Dudley E.C.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several classes of molecules implicated in the regulation of apoptosis were noted to change as DN III cells moved on to become DN IV cells. First, the prototypic death receptor, Fas, shows very poor expression in DN cells compared with the high levels found in DP thymocytes (22Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunage R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Second, as recently reported (23Voll R.E. Jimi E. Phillips R.J. Barber D.F. Rincon M. Hayday A.C. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Immunity. 2000; 13: 677-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), changes were noted in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB, a known inhibitor of pro-apoptotic signaling from death receptor pathways. In mice transgenic for a luciferase gene driven by a NFκB-responsive element, luciferase activity was significantly greater in DN IV cells than in DN III and dropped precipitously in DP cells (23Voll R.E. Jimi E. Phillips R.J. Barber D.F. Rincon M. Hayday A.C. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Immunity. 2000; 13: 677-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Third, apoptosis induced by DNA damage requires an intact p53 antioncogene in thymocytes (24Guidos C.J. Williams C.J. Grandal I. Knowles G. Huang M.T.F. Danska J.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2038-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and occurs via transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF (25Fotedar R. Brickner H. Saadatmandi N. Rousselle T. Diederich L. Munshi A. Jung B. Reed J.C. Fotedar A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3652-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A lack of p53 in a CD3γ-deficient background impairs cell death in DN thymocytes and partially rescues the block in pre-TCR cell differentiation caused by this pre-TCR defect (26Haks M.C. Krimpenfort P. van den Brakel J.H.N. Kruisbeek A.M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 91-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The analysis of mutant mice expressing variant forms of either the pre-TCR or of molecules putatively associated with it support the fact that only thymocytes that succeed in generating a functional TCRβ chain selectively survive through the transition from DN III to DN IV. However, despite the elegance of these in vivo experiments, there is little direct evidence showing a cause and effect relationship between the pre-TCR expression and its proposed anti-apoptotic function. This is of some concern because multiple regulators of thymocyte survival and fate are expressed in vivo(e.g. Notch and Interleukin-7), any of which may be primarily responsible for changes observed in cells as across the DN III to DN IV transition (27Washburn T. Schweighoffer E. Gridley T. Chang D. Fowlkes B.J. Cado D. Robey E. Cell. 1997; 88: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 28Maraskovsky E. O'Reilly L.A. Teepe M. Corcoran L.M. Peschon J.J. Strasser A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In addition, the very low levels of expression of the pre-TCR in thymocytes make it very difficult to detect and even more difficult to biochemically characterize this molecule. All of these difficulties emphasize the need for additional, complementary approaches to study pTα function. In this report we undertake one such new approach by using exogenous expression of the pre-TCR genes to examine the influence that this molecule exerts on some important regulators of programmed cell death (apoptosis) and thymocyte differentiation. Here, we describe the development and characterization of a variety of stably transfected clones expressing different pre-TCR chains in a T cell line able to express a functional pre-TCR complex upon transfection of the pTα and TCRβ chains (11Barber D.F. Passoni L. Wen L. Geng L. Hayday A.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of the pre-TCR to regulate the expression of Fas, Bcl-2 family members, and the activity of key molecules such as p53 and stress-regulated kinases is analyzed here. We also test in this system the effect of pre-TCR expression in the regulation of cell death induced by DNA damage. Altogether, the results presented in this study allow us to conclude that expression of a complete and functional pre-TCR complex is able per se to regulate multiple signals that bring about the inactivation of p53, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases/stress-activated protein kinases, and down-regulation of pro-death gene products such as Fas, p21, and Bax. 4G4 cells were electroporated with DNAs encoding a TCRβ chain alone or together with HA-tagged pTαa and pTαbconstructs and were selected in G418 (Invitrogen), as described (11Barber D.F. Passoni L. Wen L. Geng L. Hayday A.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar). Clones transfected with either one isoform of the pTα chain alone, without cotransfection of the TCRβ chain, expressed the pTα mRNA as could easily be detected by reverse transcription-PCR. However, we were unable to detect any pTα protein in those selected clones either by FACS or by Western blot, thus indicating that the pre-Tα chain does not form a stable protein complex when devoid of TCRβ, consistent with what has been described before (29Groettrup M. Ungewiss K Azogui O. Palacios R. Owen M.J. Hayday A.C. von Boehmner H. Cell. 1993; 75: 283-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A truncated form of pTαb, named ΔP1P2, in which the last cytoplasmic 16 amino acids containing two proline-rich regions were deleted, was PCR-generated with the following primers: 5′-AATAGATCTCTACCATCAGGGGAATCT-3′ (containing a BglII site) and 5′-AATCCGCGGCTACTGGAGGTGCTGGCCCGC-3′ (containing a SacII site). The product was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega), from which it was subcloned in frame using BglII/SacII into the expression vector pDisplay that includes an N-terminal HA tag (Invitrogen) (13Gibbons D. Douglas N.C. Barber D.F. Liu Q. Sullo R. Geng L. Fehling H.J. von Boehmer H. Hayday A.C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression of transfected proteins was analyzed by Western blot and by intracellular flow cytometry, as described (11Barber D.F. Passoni L. Wen L. Geng L. Hayday A.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blots, 107 cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer as described previously (30Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar); subsequently the protein content of each sample was measured (DC protein assay; Bio-Rad). For detection of pTα, 600 μg of total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies (12CA.5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The precipitates were eluted off beads by boiling, separated in 15% SDS-PAGE in parallel with prestained markers, and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore). Proteins containing a HA epitope were detected with another anti-HA antibody (HA.11; Covance) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel) and developed with a chemiluminescent method (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). For detection of TCRβ, the lysates were resolved by PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and directly detected with an antibody directed against the C terminus of TCRβ (catalog number 1579 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For intracellular flow cytometry, the cell suspensions were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in a 0.3% saponin (Sigma) buffer for 10 min. Further staining steps were carried out in 0.1% saponin buffer. The antibodies used were phycoerythrin-conjugated H57–597 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated 12CA.5. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed immediately on a FACS Calibur. Data analysis was performed using CellQuest. Susceptibility to apoptosis in 4G4-derived clones was determined as follows. The cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-treated coverslips for 1–2 days before being subjected to UV irradiation (120 Jul/m2) as described previously (30Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The cells were then maintained in a serum-free, G418-free medium for 6 h and fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After permeabilization in 2% Triton X-100 and blocking for 1 h in 4% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, the TUNEL reaction was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions, except that the labeling reaction was performed at 25 °C instead of at 37 °C. After DAPI staining, the cells were mounted on coverslips and counted using a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated by counting total (DAPI-stained) and apoptotic (TUNEL-positive) cells. Fas expression was measured by flow cytometry using the Jo-2 antibody (22Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunage R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar) (anti-FAS-phycoerythrin (BD-Pharmingen)) and expressed in arbitrary units reflecting mean fluorescence intensities. All of the data plots showed unimodal distribution of Fas expression. Total cell lysates were prepared, and protein concentration was measured (DC protein assay; Bio-Rad) as described above. Each sample (400 μg) was immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK (BD-Pharmingen) or anti-p38α antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Kinase activity was assayed using, in anti-JNK precipitates, 4 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (1–79). To measure the activation of p38 an antibody anti-phospho-p38 (1:1000, Cell Signaling) was used. Total kinase levels in the different clones were assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-JNK (BD-Pharmingen) or anti-p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As a positive control, the clones were treated with a calcium ionophore (1 μm ionomycin; Calbiochem) and a phorbol ester (100 ngr/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; Calbiochem) for p38 activation or 1 m NaCl for JNK stimulation 30 min prior to cell lysis. To measure the response to genotoxic agents of the p53 pathway in each clone, 4G4 transfectants were grown to 106 cells/ml and then treated with 1 μg/ml doxorubicin (Sigma) for several periods of time. A peak in p53 phosphorylation was found to lie at 6 h of treatment fading subsequently until undetectable after 16 h. After a 6-h treatment, the cells were lysed as described above, and each sample was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-p53 antibody (Ab-1; Calbiochem) and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Ser(P)15p53 (1:1000; New England Biolabs) with appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5000; Cappel). Total p53, p21, and Bax levels in the different clones were quantified by Western blot analysis of 60 μg of total cell lysate using anti-p53 (Ab-3; Calbiochem), anti-p21WAF(SX118; Pharmingen), and anti-Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To quantify the content of Bcl-2 protein in the panel of clones, Western blots were performed using two different anti-Bcl-2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology number sc-7382 and Pharmingen number 15021A). For apoptosis studies, the cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxorubicin (Sigma) for 72 h previous to staining with propidium iodide followed by FACS analysis. The percentage of dying cells was determined by electronic gating of the sub-G1 population. The T cell line 4G4 (11Barber D.F. Passoni L. Wen L. Geng L. Hayday A.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar) was used to stably express several pre-TCR constructs. Different clones of transfectants were established by drug selection and expression of TCRβ alone; TCRβ plus either the large (pTαa) or short (pTαb) pTα isoforms; and TCRβ plus a mutant form of pTαb (termed ΔP1P2), in which two CD2-like proline motifs in the cytoplasmic tail were deleted was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1) and flow cytometry (not shown). Although the levels of expression varied slightly among different transfectant clones receiving the same cDNAs, the different gene products were readily detectable in every case (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Thus, mutations of the pTα tail did not significantly affect expression or stability of pTα or TCRβ in these cells. With the aim to determine whether the pre-TCR expression could protect from apoptotic cell death, we developed a system where apoptosis was induced in the various transfectant clones upon irradiation with UV light. Interestingly, those transfectants receiving a complete set of pre-TCR components appeared more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis than those receiving either TCRβ alone or cells expressing TCRβ plus the pTα tail mutant ΔP1P2 pTαb (Fig. 2). For example, for TCRβ-only transfectants, this procedure induced death in >80% of cells, whereas in several TCRβ+pTα transfectants, only ∼20% of cells underwent apoptosis after UV treatment. Susceptibility to this UV-induced cell death has been attributed to ligand-independent activation of Fas in T cells (31Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 32Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and it can also be mediated by p53. Consistent with this data, those clones expressing a complete pre-TCR displayed partially reduced surface Fas expression (Fig. 3) as compared with parental cells or cells expressing the TCRβ chain alone. Significantly, pre-TCR-induced changes in Fas levels were not measurably reduced in clones expressing the cytoplasmic tail mutant of pTα (Fig. 3), demonstrating a contribution of the pTα tail both to the regulation of surface Fas expression and to protection from UV-induced apoptosis. The presence of double-stranded DNA breaks caused by V(D)J recombination has been considered the source of the apoptotic response that leads to depletion of entire populations of thymocytes (24Guidos C.J. Williams C.J. Grandal I. Knowles G. Huang M.T.F. Danska J.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2038-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This critical event occurs early in the β-selection checkpoint and can be reversed by expression of a TCRβ chain paired with the pTα gene product. However, exactly how pre-TCR expression promotes protection from DNA damage-induced apoptosis is still an unresolved question. In an attempt to answer this question, we performed a set of experiments using chemotherapeutic agents as opposed to UV irradiation to avoid any Fas-mediated effects. Pre-TCR-expressing clones were treated with doxorubicin, a drug known to cause severe DNA damage through inhibition of topoisomerase II (34Kraus-Berthier L. Jan M. Guilbaud N. Naze M. Pierre A. Atassi G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 297-304PubMed Google Scholar). Upon doxorubicin treatment, transfectants expressing a full set of pre-TCR components displayed high levels of protection relative to those receiving either TCRβ alone or cells receiving TCRβ plus the pTα tail mutant (Fig.4). For example, for TCRβ-only transfectants the death rate was between 80 and 95% of cells, whereas less than 30% of the TCRβ+pTα transfectants were dead. These data demonstrated that expression of pre-TCR is sufficient per seto effectively protect cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis. It has been suggested that the pre-TCR regulates progression through the DNA damage checkpoint characteristic of the DN to DP transition by inactivating p53 (26Haks M.C. Krimpenfort P. van den Brakel J.H.N. Kruisbeek A.M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 91-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). With the aim to biochemically assess whether pre-TCR could somehow regulate p53 levels or activity, we set out to determine whether the total levels of p53 and two well established p53-regulated genes, namely p21WAF (35el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar) and Bax (36Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), were altered in representative clones expressing TCRβ alone or TCRβ plus any of the pTα isoforms and TCRβ plus ΔP1P2 pTαb. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the total content of p21WAF or Bax protein was markedly reduced in those clones expressing either isoform of the pTα. In sharp contrast, the total amount of a pivotal pro-survival gene product, Bcl-2, was increased in those particular clones (Fig. 5 C). Essentially the same result was obtained using a second anti-Bcl-2 antibody (15021A, BD-Pharmingen). The levels of p53 protein were very similar in all clones tested, indicating that possible changes in the amount of total p53 do not seem to be the cause of the differences observed in p21WAF and Bax expression. Of note, clones expressing the ΔP1P2 mutant of the pTαb plus TCRβ did not display any detectable changes in p21WAF, Bcl-2, or Bax when compared with TCRβ-expressing control cells. These results pointed at the possibility that the p53 transcriptional activity, and not total p53 levels, was somehow decreased in pTα-expressing cells. To further challenge this hypothesis, we needed to test the functionality of the p53 protein itself. With that purpose, we took advantage of the availability of sensitive anti-phospho-p53 antibodies that allowed us to test the activation status of the p53 proteinin situ. In particular, phosphorylation of Ser15in p53 has been demonstrated to increase the ability to transactivate p21WAF upon DNA damage (37Siciliano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Apella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) and represents a prototypical marker for p53 activation upon DNA damage. In cells treated with doxorubicin, an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, we could observe a clear phosphorylation of endogenous p53 in cells expressing TCRβ that were used as a control when the same total levels of p53 were loaded into the gel (Fig. 5 C). However, we detected differences in the activation status of p53 in response to doxorubicin in the different 4G4-derived clones. The amount of phosphorylated p53 was reduced in cells expressing pTαb plus TCRβ as compared with cells expressing only TCRβ, although this difference was even more evident in cells expressing pTαa plus TCRβ, where very low levels of phosphorylated p53 could be detected (Fig. 5 C). We also noticed that transfectants expressing the ΔP1P2 pTαb mutant showed normal levels of p53 phosphorylation. This observation highlights again the importance of the cytoplasmic domain of the pTα for certain biochemical effects of the pre-TCR and further corroborates that expression of a functional pre-TCR protein leads to defective phosphorylation of p53 upon DNA damage. Several studies have established a very important role for mitogen- and stress-activated kinases in the regulation of thymocyte development and survival (38Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2490-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To gain a mechanistic understanding on how the pre-TCR might contribute to the regulation of this type of pathway, 4G4 transfectants were examined for changes in the status of two such protein kinases, JNK and p38α. Pre-TCR transfectants showed increased basal kinase activity of JNK. Most notable was the absence of any JNK activity in transfectants expressing the tail mutant of pTα plus TCRβ (Fig.6); indeed, JNK activities in these transfectants were lower than those found in cells receiving TCRβ alone. By contrast, absolute levels of JNK protein were essentially the same in all clones (Fig. 6 B). We next tested the ability of the pre-TCR to modulate a mitogen-activated kinase that has also been implicated in the regulation of thymocyte development (39Mulroy T. Sen J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3056-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 40Diehl N.L. Enslen H. Fortner K.A. Merritt C. Stetson N. Charland C. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Rincon M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) namely p38. The basal activity of p38 appears to be elevated in the pTαb-expressing cells when compared with TCRβ or pTαa transfectants that showed very low p38 activity (Fig. 6 A). Also in this case, deletion of intracytoplasmic domains abolished the transduction of signals from the receptor to the p38 kinase.

https://openalex.org/W2049200411,"The retinoid X receptor (RXR) isoform RXRγ has limited tissue expression, including brain, skeletal muscle, and anterior pituitary gland. Within the anterior pituitary gland, RXRγ expression is limited primarily to the thyrotropes. In this report, we have isolated ∼3 kb of 5′-flanking DNA of the mouse RXRγ1 gene. We have identified the major transcription start site in the thyrotrope-derived TtT-97 cells. Transient transfection studies show that a 1.4-kb promoter fragment has full promoter activity in TtT-97 cells. This promoter has much less activity in thyrotrope-derived αTSH cells, pituitary-derived GH3 somatomammotropes, and non-pituitary CV-1 cells. None of these cell lines has detectable RXRγ1 mRNA. A previous report has identified a non-consensus direct repeat (DR-1) element in the RXRγ2 gene promoter region that mediates stimulation of promoter activity by 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA). Inspection of the RXRγ1 promoter region revealed a non-consensus DR-1 element at −232 bp from the transcription start site. Interestingly, RXRγ1 promoter activity was suppressed 50% by 9-cis-RA in the TtT-97 thyrotropes. Further experiments in non-pituitary cells showed that suppression of RXRγ1 promoter activity was RXR-dependent. Mutagenesis of the DR-1 element abrogated suppression of promoter activity by 9-cis-RA, suggesting that this negative regulation requires both RXR and this specific DR-1 element. In summary, we have isolated the mouse RXRγ1 gene promoter region and identified the major start site in thyrotropes. Promoter activity is uniquely suppressed by 9-cis-RA through a DR-1 element. Isolation and characterization of the mouse RXRγ1 promoter region provides a tool for further investigation focusing on thyrotrope-specific gene expression as well as negative regulation of genes by retinoic acid.AF525492 The retinoid X receptor (RXR) isoform RXRγ has limited tissue expression, including brain, skeletal muscle, and anterior pituitary gland. Within the anterior pituitary gland, RXRγ expression is limited primarily to the thyrotropes. In this report, we have isolated ∼3 kb of 5′-flanking DNA of the mouse RXRγ1 gene. We have identified the major transcription start site in the thyrotrope-derived TtT-97 cells. Transient transfection studies show that a 1.4-kb promoter fragment has full promoter activity in TtT-97 cells. This promoter has much less activity in thyrotrope-derived αTSH cells, pituitary-derived GH3 somatomammotropes, and non-pituitary CV-1 cells. None of these cell lines has detectable RXRγ1 mRNA. A previous report has identified a non-consensus direct repeat (DR-1) element in the RXRγ2 gene promoter region that mediates stimulation of promoter activity by 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA). Inspection of the RXRγ1 promoter region revealed a non-consensus DR-1 element at −232 bp from the transcription start site. Interestingly, RXRγ1 promoter activity was suppressed 50% by 9-cis-RA in the TtT-97 thyrotropes. Further experiments in non-pituitary cells showed that suppression of RXRγ1 promoter activity was RXR-dependent. Mutagenesis of the DR-1 element abrogated suppression of promoter activity by 9-cis-RA, suggesting that this negative regulation requires both RXR and this specific DR-1 element. In summary, we have isolated the mouse RXRγ1 gene promoter region and identified the major start site in thyrotropes. Promoter activity is uniquely suppressed by 9-cis-RA through a DR-1 element.

Within the anterior pituitary gland, transcription factors including thyroid hormone receptor (TRβ2), Pit-1, GATA-2, ETS-1, and steroidogenic factor (SF-1) have expression limited to certain cell types, leading to specific cell phenotypes and hormone production (1Hodin R.A.

The RXRα and RXRβ isoforms are widely distributed throughout the developing embryo and in the adult, while the RXRγ isoform has restricted tissue distribution, which includes a high level of expression in the pituitary gland early in development (8Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). RXRγ has two isotypes, RXRγ1 and RXRγ2, which are generated from the same gene and differ at the N terminus (9Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). RXRγ1 and RXRγ2 gene expression is believed to be controlled by two separate regulatory regions. The RXRγ2 coding region is entirely contained within RXRγ1 which has an additional 123 amino acids on the N-terminal end (9Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). Our group and others (9Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar, 10Haugen B.R. Brown N.S. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. Mol.

RXRγ1 is not required for thyrotrope development or basal expression of the TSHβ subunit promoter within the thyrotropes, but does appear to be required for vitamin A-mediated suppression of TSHβ promoter activity within thyrotropes seen both in vitro and in vivo (10Haugen B.R.

The human RXRγ2 gene 5′-flanking region has been identified and contains a retinoid-responsive element, which confers positive regulation of promoter activity by retinoic acid (12Barger P.M. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2722-2728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this report, we have isolated the RXRγ1 promoter and begun to characterize its regulation in thyrotropes. An understanding of RXRγ1 promoter function in thyrotropes and other cell types will provide insight into mechanisms governing thyrotrope-specific gene expression and phenotype, as well as the generalized mechanism of cell-specific gene expression. A cDNA λ phage library was constructed from mouse thyrotrope tumor (TtT-97) poly(A)+ RNA as described previously (13Wood W.M. Ocran K.O. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The library was screened with a nick-translated 32P-labeled NotI cDNA fragment of the mouse RXRγ1 coding region (plasmid kindly provided by R. Evans). This was performed to obtain 5′-untranslated sequence of mouse RXRγ1. To obtain a large fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the RXRγ1 gene, a λ EMBL-3 SP6/T7 mouse genomic library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with a nick-translated 32P-labeled PCR product of the 5′-untranslated region of mouse RXRγ1. 5′-RACE was carried out using the CLONTECH Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH, Laboratories). TtT-97 poly(A)+ RNA was treated with reverse transcriptase using a 52-bp oligonucleotide with a poly(dT) end. Following second strand synthesis, double-stranded cDNA was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase I and ligated to an adapter primer supplied with the Marathon kit. Adapter ligated cDNAs were amplified by PCR using an antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the translational start (complement of ATG in bold) of RXRγ1 (5′-CCATACATGTTGGCTGCTCAGTT-3′) and a sense oligonucleotide within the 5′ adapter (AP-1). PCR was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 65 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 3 min, followed by extension at 72 °C for 7 min using TaKara LATaq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Amplified products were size-separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, transferred to a Nytran membrane, and hybridized with a 20-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to a region just upstream of the translational start of RXRγ1 to verify the size and specificity of the amplification. PCR products were excised the appropriate section of the gel, purified, and subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. A 431-bpNsiI/HindIII fragment of the RXRγ1 5′-flanking region, purified from the 3.1-kb XhoI/NotI 5′-flanking region in pGL2-basic, was subcloned into pGEM3zf+ (digested with PstI/HindIII). The resultant plasmid was linearized with BamHI, and a radiolabeled antisense RNA probe was generated using SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]dUTP (800 Ci/mmol). A positive control RNA (unlabeled sense strand) was generated using a product from 5′-RACE subcloned into pGEM7zf+ and linearized with NcoI. RNA was generated using SP6 RNA polymerase, and the product was treated with RQ DNase I to eliminate contaminating DNA. The resultant product, when hybridized with the 431-bp radiolabeled antisense probe and digested with RNase, should generate a 177-bp protected product. The protection assay was carried out as outlined in the Ribonuclease Protection Assay Kit (Ambion). Briefly, 5 μg of TtT-97, αTSH, or GH3 poly(A)+ RNA was precipitated with 3 × 106 cpm of antisense riboprobe. The pellets were resuspended, and hybridization of the probe and RNA was carried out at 42 °C overnight. The annealed products were treated with a 1:5 dilution of RNase (A + T1) for 30 min at 37 °C, precipitated, and the digested products were size-separated on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed to radiographic film. 5 μg of TtT-97 poly(A)+ RNA was treated with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamer oligonucleotides. Each DNA product from 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was subsequently used for each PCR reaction with a common 3′ antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GCGAATTCCATGGCAGAAGTGATGACT-3′) corresponding to sequence in exon 2 of the RXRγ1 coding region and different 5′ sense oligonucleotides corresponding to regions upstream and downstream of the transcription start site identified by RNase protection analysis (+33/+50 (lane A), −146/−130 (lane B), −241/−227 (lane C), −437/−420 (lane D), Fig. 3). After 35 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min), products were size separated on an agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to a common region in all potential products (+64/+84). The 3.1-kb XhoI/NotI DNA fragment of the RXRγ1 gene (Fig. 1 A) was used as a positive control for each of the 5′ oligonucleotides with the common 3′ oligonucleotide (+64/+84, Fig. 1 B).Figure 1RXR γ1 promoter.

A pGL1.4 reporter plasmid was generated by blunt ligation of the 1.4-kbSacI/NotI fragment of the RXRγ1 gene (−1139 to +207) into the pGL2-basic plasmid at the SmaI site. ASacI/PvuII fragment of the RXRγ1 gene (−1142 to +194) was cloned into the SmaI site of the pA3luciferase (pA3luc) plasmid in both orientations by blunt ligation. A pGL556 reporter plasmid containing the −483 to +73 region of the RXRγ1 gene was generated by PCR and subcloned by blunt ligation into the pGL2-basic plasmid at the SmaI site. A pGL556DR1mut reporter plasmid was generated in a similar fashion, except the DR-1 element was replaced with an XhoI site by ligation of two separate PCR products. An RXRα expression plasmid was generated by ligation of the coding region of mRXRα into the pW1 human β-actin promoter plasmid, a modified pGEM9zf(−) (Promega) vector with an actin promoter (14Balkan W. Colbert M. Bock C. Linney E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3347-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All plasmid constructs were verified for ligation fidelity and orientation by sequencing. Transient transfection assays have been previously described (10Haugen B.R. Brown N.S. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of the different RXRγ1 promoter fragments in pA3luc or pGL2 and 1 μg pCMV-β-galactosidase DNA as an internal control were transfected by electroporation into 7–10 million TtT-97 cells, 3 million αTSH cells or 5 million GH3 cells. Similar amounts of plasmid DNA were transfected into 800,000 CV-1 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. After harvest, cells were subjected to freeze-thaw extraction and assayed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described previously (15Haugen B.R. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20818-20824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells were passed at a density of 2 × 105/10-cm plate. The following day, 10 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 0–1 μg of RXRα expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (16Underhill T.M. Cash D.E. Linney E. Mol. Endo. 1994; 8: 274-285PubMed Google Scholar). The media was changed the following day, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with or without 500 nm 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) from a 10 mm stock solution in 100% ethanol. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Tissue were collected from 5 male wild-type SvJ129 mice, and total RNA was prepared from each tissue separately (TriReagent, Sigma). Quantitative mRNA analysis was carried out for mRXRγ1 and mRXRγ2 using the ABI 7700 system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primers and probes (containing fluorochrome and quencher) were generated against each specific RNA using a Primer Express program (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primer and probe sequences are available upon request. Primer and probe concentrations were optimized against total TtT-97 RNA (17Sherman S.I. Gopal J. Haugen B.R. Chiu A.C. Whaley K.N.P. Duvic M. New Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). TtT-97 total RNA was subsequently used to generate quantitative standard curves for sample analysis. Standard curves were linear between 0.1 and 200 ng of total RNA for RXRγ1 (r = 0.992) and RXRγ2 (r = 0.994). Amplification reactions were performed in MicroAmp optical tubes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 50-μl volume containing 8% glycerol, 1× TaqMan buffer A (500 mm KCl, 100 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 600 nm passive reference dye ROX), 300 μm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, 600 μm dUTP, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 12.5 units of Moloney Murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 20 units of RNAsin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), and input RNA. Samples were run in duplicate with a control-lacking reverse transcriptase (no RT). The no RT signal was consistently <1% of the RT-PCR reaction. Input total RNA was first determined against an 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) control (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog number 4308310), which correlated well with RNA amount determined by optical density. Input total RNA was 300–700 ng for the RXRγ isotype measurements. Individual target RNA concentrations were corrected for input RNA based on rRNA meaurements. Reverse transcription was performed at 48 °C for 30 min followed by activation of TaqGold at 95 °C for 10 min. Subsequently 40 cycles of amplification were performed at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The detection threshold was set above the mean base-line fluorescence determined during the first 15 cycles. Threshold cycle was determined when fluorescence intensity first increased above detection threshold, and sample values were generated from the standard curve. A TtT-97 thyrotrope cDNA library was screened with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to the coding region of RXRγ1 to obtain additional 5′-untranslated sequence present in thyrotropes. A clone was obtained containing the entire coding sequence as well as both 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequence. The 5′-untranslated sequence corresponded to a sequence previously reported from a murine skeletal muscle cDNA library (9Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). To define the 5′ extent of the RXRγ1 mRNA in thyrotropes, 5′-RACE was performed on TtT-97 poly(A)+ RNA. PCR was performed on the cDNA population with a specific adapter on the 5′ end using an antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to sequence in exon 2 of RXRγ1 and a sense oligonucleotide corresponding to sequence in the adapter at the 5′ end of the insert. The largest fragments generated were subcloned and sequenced. The two largest clones were ∼570 and 600 bp corresponding to 431 and 455 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence, respectively. A λ EMBL-3 SP6/T7 mouse genomic library was screened by using a cDNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region of RXRγ1. A 3.1-kb XhoI to NotI fragment was identified, subcloned, and partially sequenced (Fig.1). The 3′ end of the genomic fragment was identical to 205 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence identified by 5′-RACE. RNase protection analysis was carried out by subcloning an NsiI/HindIII fragment of RXRγ1 (Fig. 1 A) into pGEM3 and generating a 431-bp radiolabeled antisense RNA by linearization with BamHI. The radiolabeled fragment was hybridized with 5 μg of TtT-97, αTSH, and GH3 poly(A)+ RNA and treated with RNase. TtT-97 thyrotropes express RXRγ1 mRNA, while the thyrotrope-derived αTSH cells and somatotrope-derived GH3 cells do not (10Haugen B.R. Brown N.S. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The protected fragments are shown in Fig. 2. The largest major protected band was 208 bp using TtT-97 RNA (arrow,lane 1). No protected bands were detected using αTSH or GH3 RNA (lanes 2 and 3). Lane 4 shows the positive control RNA, which generated the predicted 177-bp protected product. Lane 5 shows the untreated 431-bp riboprobe. The transcription start site (+1) was mapped to a position 3 bp upstream of the largest 5′-RACE product, which results in 458 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence. A TAATA element is located at −36 bp relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that no RXRγ RNA transcripts were derived from sequences upstream of this start site in thyrotropes, RT-PCR was performed using randomly primed TtT-97 mRNA. A common antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to sequence in exon 2 was used to generate PCR products across an exon-intron boundary to avoid genomic DNA contamination. Sense oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to +33/+50 (A), −146/−130 (B), −241/−227 (C), and −437/−420 (D). PCR products were size-separated and transferred to nitrocellulose for Southern blot analysis. Fig.3 A shows a strong signal using oligonucleotide A, while a faint signal was generated using oligonucleotide B. Oligonucleotides C and D generated no products. PCR of a DNA plasmid control revealed relatively similar amounts of PCR products using each of the sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the major transcription start is between −146 and +33, but a minority of larger transcripts are generated, as can also be seen in the RNase protection analysis (Fig. 2). Gene transfer of the XhoI/NotI (3.1 kb) andSacI/NotI (1.4 kb) 5′-flanking fragments of RXRγ1 in pGL2basic was carried out by electroporation in TtT-97 thyrotropes. Both fragments had 350–450-fold higher luciferase activity compared with the promoterless pGL2basic vector (data not shown), suggesting that the SacI/NotI fragment contained all of the sequences necessary for full promoter activity. To verify the 1.4-kb RXRγ1 fragment as a promoter region in thyrotropes, a −1133 to +207 (SacI/PvuII) fragment of the RXRγ1 5′-flanking region was subcloned into pA3luc in both orientations. Gene transfer by transient transfection was carried out in TtT-97 thyrotropes, which showed promoter activity at 390-fold over the promoterless vector (Fig. 4). Reverse orientation of the plasmid displayed 4% of the activity of the forward orientation. The same experiments were carried out in αTSH, GH3, and CV-1 cells, which either lack or have very low levels of RXRγ1 mRNA. Promoter activity was higher than the promoterless vector in all cell types tested; however, relative luciferase activity (forward compared with reverse) was greater in the TtT-97 thyrotropes compared with these other cell types (Fig.5), suggesting cell-specific activity of the RXRγ1 promoter.Figure 5mRXRγ1 promoter activity in different pituitary-derived and non-pituitary cell types. Transient transfections were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” 20 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the SacI/PvuII fragment of the RXRγ1 promoter either in forward, or reverse orientation was transfected into 7–10 million TtT-97 cells, 3 million αTSH cells, 5 million GH3 cells, or 0.8 million CV-1 cells. Results are expressed as -fold promoter activity in the forward orientation over promoter activity in the reverse orientation. Mean values and S.E. for at least six separate experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RXRγ1 promoter activity and mRNA expression are low in GH3 and αTSH cells, but RXRγ2 mRNA is detectable in these tissues (10Haugen B.R. Brown N.S. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One hypothesis is that RXRγ2 down-regulates RXRγ1 expression in tissues and cell lines. To test this, we measured RXRγ1 and RXRγ2 mRNA expression in TtT-97 thyrotropes and a variety of mouse tissues. Fig.6 shows that RXRγ1 and RXRγ2 are both highly expressed in the TtT-97 thyrotropes, suggesting that endogenous RXRγ2 does not inhibit the expression of RXRγ1. RXRγ1 is also expressed in skeletal muscle and brain, which confirms previous data using Northern blot analysis (9Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). These data also show that RXRγ1 is expressed in mouse pituitary, but not adipose or thyroid tissue. RXRγ2 is expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, which also confirms previous studies (9Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). Activity of the RXRγ2 promoter is stimulated by 9-cis-RA through an imperfect DR-1 element (12Barger P.M. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2722-2728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sequence examination of the RXRγ1 promoter revealed a putative DR-1 element at position −232 (Fig.1 B). We therefore examined the effects of 9-cis-RA on the RXRγ1 promoter in thyrotropes. Fig.7 shows that 9-cis-RA suppressed promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in thyrotropes, suggesting opposite regulation of the two RXRγ gene promoters by retinoic acid. To examine the effect of retinoic acid on the RXRγ1 promoter in non-pituitary cells, similar experiments were carried out in mouse embryonal carcinoma cells (P19). 9-cis-RA also suppressed RXRγ1 promoter activity in these cells in an RXR-dependent manner as shown by the addition of increasing amounts of an RXRα expression vector (Fig.8 A). An RXRγ1 promoter fragment with a mutation in the DR-1 element was generated by PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.” A promoter fragment with the wild-type DR-1 element retained suppression of activity with 9-cis-RA (Fig. 8 B), while mutagenesis of DR-1 in this promoter context lost suppression of activity with 9-cis-RA.Figure 8The 9-cis-retinoic acid effect on RXR γ1 promoter activity is mediated through an imperfect DR-1 site. Transient transfections were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.”A, P19 cells were transfected in triplicate with 10 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid containing theSacI/NotI fragment of the RXRγ1 promoter. Cells were co-transfected with either empty vector or increasing amounts of an RXRα expression plasmid, then subjected to treatment with either vehicle (open bars) or 0.5 μm 9-cis-RA (black bars). Results are expressed as -fold promoter activity versus promoterless vector. B, P19 cells were transfected in triplicate with 10 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid containing the −483 to +73 region of the RXRγ1 promoter containing a mutation of the putative DR-1 element (Fig. 1 B) generated by PCR mutagenesis (pGL556DR1mut) or without the mutation (pGL556).

RXRα and RXRβ are widely expressed throughout development and in the adult, while RXRγ has a more limited tissue distribution.

Thein vitro activity of retinoids appears to require RXRγ. Thyrotropes express a number of genes with limited tissue distribution. The TSHβ subunit is expressed only in the thyrotropes, with the exception of a few reports showing limited expression in the enterocytes and pars intermedia (22Wang J. Whetsell M. Klein J.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1937-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mechanisms governing this limited expression appear to include gene activation by two transcription factors, Pit-1 and GATA-2, both of which also have limited tissue distribution (4Gordon D.F. Lewis S.R. Haugen B.R. James A. McDermott M.T. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24339-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two other pituitary-restricted hormone genes, growth hormone and prolactin, also require Pit-1 for gene expression, but appear to use different partners interacting with a composite element for unique cell-type expression. The growth hormone promoter contains a binding site for the transcription factor Zn-15, which is flanked by two Pit-1 binding sites (23Lipkin S.M. Naar A.M. Kalla K.A. Sack R.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24VanderHeyden T.C. Wojtkiewicz P.W. Voss T.C. Mangin T.M. Harrelson Z. Ahlers K.M. Phelps C.J. Hurley D.L. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast, the prolactin promoter contains a composite Pit-1/ETS-1 binding site believed to direct unique expression of this gene in lactotropes (5Bradford A.P. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Inspection of the RXRγ1 promoter region does not reveal any consensus Pit-1/GATA-2 elements. This would suggest that expression of this gene in thyrotropes is through nonconsensus composite Pit-1/GATA-2 elements, or expression of RXRγ1 in thyrotropes is through a different mechanism than TSHβ subunit expression. Two subtypes of RXRγ (γ1 and γ2) are generated from the RXRγ gene locus. These two subtypes appear to be under control of separate regulatory regions. The RXRγ2 protein is 123 amino acids shorter than RXRγ1 on the N-terminal end, but the remaining 340 amino acids, including the DNA binding and ligand binding domains, are identical. RXRγ2 appears to be generated from a separate promoter and contains a unique 5′ exon and 5′-untranslated region (9Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). The human RXRγ2 promoter has been isolated, but cell-specific expression of this promoter has not been examined (12Barger P.M. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2722-2728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that RXRγ1 mRNA is highly expressed in mouse pituitaries, while RXRγ2 is expressed at low levels (11Brown N.S. Smart A. Sharma V. Brinkmeier M.L. Greenlee L. Camper S.A. Jensen D.R. Eckel R.H. Krezel W. Chambon P. Haugen B.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We show here that the mouse RXRγ1 promoter exhibits high activity in thyrotrope-derived TtT-97 cells, which express RXRγ1 mRNA, but relatively low activity in pituitary-derived cell types (αTSH, GH3), which lack detectable RXRγ1 mRNA (10Haugen B.R. Brown N.S. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the regulation of RXRγ1 gene expression is influenced, at least in part, by tissue-specific regulation in the −1142 to +194 region of the RXRγ1 promoter. Analysis of the RXRγ2 human gene promoter reveals an imperfect retinoid X response element (GGTTGAAAGGTCA) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (12Barger P.M. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2722-2728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The authors further show that this element is required for retinoic acid stimulation of promoter activity, which is believed to mediate RXR-dependent transcriptional autoactivation. This DR-1 element behaves like a classic RXRE in the RXRγ2 promoter. Examination of the mouse RXRγ1 promoter reveals a similar imperfect DR-1 element (CTTTCACAGATCA) at position −220 to −232. In contrast to the RXRγ2 promoter, our studies show that RXRγ1 promoter activity is down-regulated by retinoic acid in the thyrotrope-derived TtT-97 cells. One could argue that this suppression of promoter activity is thyrotrope-specific, but we also observed this effect in the non-pituitary P19 cells, suggesting a generalized mechanism of negative regulation of this promoter/gene by retinoic acid. Mutagenesis of the DR-1 element blocked negative regulation of RXRγ1 promoter activity by 9-cis-RA confirming this DR-1 element as necessary for negative regulation by retinoic acid. The mouse RXRβ gene has been isolated and the promoter region has been studied (25Nagata T. Kanno Y. Ozato K. Taketo M. Gene. 1994; 142: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Sugawara A. Uruno A. Nagata T. Taketo M.M. Takeuchi K. Ito S.

Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Like RXRγ, there appears to be two different isotypes, RXRβ1 and RXRβ2, which have unique regulatory regions. Examination of a limited region of the RXRβ1 promoter did not reveal a classical DR-1 element. Transient transfection studies using the RXRβ1 promoter in GH3 cells showed no regulatory response of promoter activity by treatment with 9-cis-RA (26Sugawara A. Uruno A. Nagata T. Taketo M.M. Takeuchi K. Ito S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Both RXRγ1 and RXRγ2 promoter regions contain a DR-1 element, and both promoter activities are regulated by 9-cis-RA, albeit in different directions. These data would suggest that RXRγ1 not only has unique expression in a limited number of cell types, but unique regulation by retinoic acid in comparison to other retinoid X receptors.

Although gstD21 mRNA is labile, the coding region of the gene gains stability when separated from its native UTRs. Just the opposite is true for mRNA of the D21 homologue, gstD1. This mRNA is very stable, but the coding region of the molecule alone, without native UTRs, is even more labile than intrinsically unstable gstD21 mRNA. To further investigate the nature and the cause of this instability, we assembled chimeric D1-D21 mRNAs containing various segments of the D1 coding sequence. We observed that these chimeras were also unstable in the same context of heterologous UTRs as the D1 coding sequence. We repeatedly detected putative decay intermediates from the D21 portion, but seldom the D1 segment of these chimeric mRNAs. Such patterns are strong evidence for the presence of cryptic destabilizing cis-acting elements in the coding region of gstD1 mRNA. Our observations also suggest that the stability of already abundantgstD1 mRNA is maintained by a stabilizer element in its UTRs, which overrides any destabilizing elements in the coding region. We speculate that this combination of stabilizer and destabilizing elements helps to regulate gstD1 mRNA levels in response to pentobarbital induction and to generally maintain mRNA stability. As we compare the characteristics of labilegstD21 mRNA with those of gstD1 mRNA, in which a completely different arrangement of cis-acting elements govern RNA metabolism, we note the potential for significant diversity in the regulation of different members of a single multigene family.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The Δ2–3 line {P[ry+ Δ2–3](99B)} (11Robertson H.M. Preston C.R. Phillis R.W. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Benz W.K. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1987; 118: 461-470Google Scholar) expressing transposase and the yw line were obtained from Susan Abmayr and David Gilmour, respectively, both of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University. The E. coli expression plasmids for GST D1 (pGTDm1-KK) and GST D21 (pGTDm21-KK) were previously reported (12Tang A.H. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27876-27884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids for C-terminal FLAG derivatives of D1 (D1-F) and D21 (D21-F), as well as plasmid for the G8S,G9S mutant of D21-F, were unpublished laboratory stocks. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the QuikChangeTMmutagenesis procedure (Stratagene). All clones were sequenced at the Penn State Nucleic Acid Facility prior to microinjection into embryos. The primers D1-F-5′ (GGAATTCCCCAACATGGTTGACTTCTACTACC) and D1-F-3′ (CGGGATCCGTGAATATCAGGCTTACT) were used to PCR amplify thegstD1.F coding region. PCR amplification (12Tang A.H. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27876-27884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the D1-D21 and D21-D1 chimeras was set up using the appropriate pair permutations of primers from the set D1-F-5′, D1-F-3′, D21-F-5′ (GGAATTCCCCAACATGGACTTTTACTACATGCC), and D21-F-3′ (CGGGATCCTCGTGATACCGATCACTTG). The coding region of gstD1, with a FLAG octapeptide at its C terminus (gstD1-F), was PCR-amplified from pGTDm1-FLAG-KK using primers D1-F-5′ and D1-F-3′ (KK refers to the pKK223-3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences)). TheBamHI-EcoRI-digested fragment was cloned into pCaSpeR-hs-act (10Thummel C.S. Boulet A.M. Lipshitz H.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) to obtain pBA1-CaSpeR. The transgene is called D1F-UTR (D1-FLAG − UTR). Primers D21-F-5′ and D21-F-3′ were used to introduce by PCR BamHI and EcoRI sites at the ends of the D21-F-G8S,G9S coding region. The PCR products were then digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated intoBamHI-EcoRI-digested pCaSpeR-hs-act to generate pBA3-CaSpeR. To switch segments of GST D1 and GST D21 at the 66th and 65th residues (Fig. 1), primers D1-F-R66-SmaI-S (GTGGGAGTCCCGCGCCATCCAGGTG) and D1-F-R66-SmaI-AS (CACCTGGATGGCCCGGGTCTCCCAG) were used to introduce a SmaI site into pGTDm1-KK by site-directed mutagenesis without changing the amino acid sequence encoded by the template. The SmaI fragment of the resulting plasmid (pGTDm1-SmaI-KK) was cloned into calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated, SmaI-digested pGTDm21-FLAG-G8S,G9S-KK to obtain pBA12-KK. The transgene, which contains the N-terminal 65 amino acids of D21 and C-terminal 150 amino acids of D1F, is called D21-65-D1. The opposite swap, resulting in pBA10-KK, was made by inserting the SmaI fragment of pGTDm21-FLAG-KK into calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated, SmaI-digested pGTDm1-FLAG-KK. The transgene, which contains the N-terminal 66 amino acids of D1 and C-terminal 157 amino acids of D21F, is called D1–66-D21. The exchange at the 171st (D1) and 170th (D21) amino acid position was initiated by the introduction of anXhoI site into both pGTDm1-FLAG-KK (D1F-F171L-XhoI-S (GCAGGTGGCCAAACTCGAGATCAGCAAGTAC) and D1F-F171L-XhoI-AS (GTACTTGCTGATCTCGAGTTTGGCCACCTCG)) and pGTDm21-FLAG-G8S,G9S-KK (D21-F170L/D171E-XhoI-S (GTTCGAAGTTAGTGATCTCGAGTTCAGCAAGTACTCC) and D21-F170L/D171E-XhoI-AS (GGAGTACTTGCTGAACTCGAGCTCACTAACTTCGAAC)), which yield pBA1-XhoI-KK and pBA2-XhoI-KK, respectively. TheXhoI-SmaI fragment of pBA2-XhoI-KK was cloned into XhoI-SmaI-digested pBA1-XhoI-KK to generate pBA13-KK. This led to the transgene D1–171-D21, which contains 171 amino acids of D1 followed by 52 amino acids of D21-F at the C terminus. Because the gstD21 coding region has a second SmaI site that interferes with cloning, the XhoI-PstI fragment of pBA1-XhoI-KK was cloned into pBA2-XhoI-KK, resulting in pBA15-KK. The corresponding transgene is called D21-170-D1, which contains 170 amino acids of D21 followed by 45 amino acids from the C-terminal of D1-F. Prior to cloning into pCaSpeR-hs-act DNA, BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites were introduced by PCR at the desired ends of the constructs described thus far, using the appropriate pair of starting primers from the set D1-F-5′, D1-F-3′, D21-F-5′, and D21-F-3′. A FLAG-less version of pBA1-CaSpeR (i.e. pBA22-CaSpeR) was constructed using the same strategy, but changing the 3′-end PCR primer to D1-3′ (CGGGATCCGTGAATATCAGGCTTATTC) from D1-F-3′. This transgene is called D1-UTR. Construction of transgene D21L-UTR will be described elsewhere. All clones in pKK223-3 and pCaSpeR-hs-act vectors were sequenced at the Penn State Nucleic Acid Facility. Results also showed that the four chimeric proteins (D1-66-D21, D21–65-D1, D1-171-D21, and D21-170-D1) were successfully expressed from the pKK223-3-based expression constructs in E. coli. 2B. Akgül, Y.-S. L. Tu, and C.-P. D. Tu, unpublished results. Plasmid DNA was prepared for microinjection using a ConcertTM rapid plasmid DNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Microinjection of embryos was subsequently performed, as previously described (13Spradling A. Rubin G.R. Science. 1982; 218: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 14Lee M.P. Brown S.D.

The newly enclosed G0 flies were crossed singly to yw to remove any transposase background. Yellow- to red-eyed G1progeny with longer body bristles (Sb−) were re-crossed with yw. Stable lines were established through sibling crossings of colored-eye G2 virgin flies. Three separate lines were maintained for each transgene. Adult flies (2–3 days old) were distributed into clean milk bottles in approximately equal numbers for 5 h starvation at room temperature (21–23 °C) (15Tang A.H. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13819-13825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Control flies received a blotting paper strip (3 × 10 cm) saturated with a solution of 5% sucrose; PB-treated flies received a strip soaked in 5% sucrose plus 200 mg/ml PB. The strips were placed in the fly bottles for 2 h at room temperature. Heat shock was administered by incubating flies at 35 °C for 1 h in clean bottles containing 5% sucrose paper strips in a Robbins Scientific Co. (Sunnyvale, CA) hybridization oven (model 2000). (An empty milk bottle with a foam plug requires ∼15 min to reach 35 °C from room temperature and takes ∼6 min to drop to 31 °C after removal of the bottle from the 35 °C oven.) In addition, heat shock treatments of varying duration were carried out at 35 °C for 5–40 min (instead of 1 h) to detect labile transgenic mRNAs. The flies were subsequently snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until use. RNA was isolated from pulverized flies according to a protocol from Ullrich et al.(16Ullrich A. Shine J. Chirgwin J. Pictet R. Tischer E. Rutter W.J. Goodman H.M. Science. 1977; 196: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The templates used to prepare our radiolabeled riboprobes, pSP64(A).D21AS, pSP64(A).D1AS, and pSP64(A).RP-49AS, were constructed by RT-PCR amplification. Each plasmid DNA was linearized with an appropriate restriction enzyme then transcribed in vitrousing [α-32P]UTP. RPA analyses of 40 μg of total RNA samples were conducted according to procedures specified by Ambion, manufacturer of the RPAIII kits. In our figures, we call the protection product of endogenous gstD1 mRNA “endo-D1.” For transgenes, protection products of expected sizes are labeled as “transgene”; those smaller than the expected sizes are called “decay intermediates” (Int). The 5′ end sequence of the gstD1 mRNA was determined by primer extension using the primer 5′-AGCGGCAGGGGGAGGAGCCGGGCA-3′ and by circular RT-PCR (17Mandl C.W. Heinz F.X. Puchhammer-Stockl E. Kunz C. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 484-486PubMed Google Scholar,18Couttet P. Fromont-Racine M. Steel D. Pictet R. Grange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5628-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Decapping, DNase I treatment, and circularization of RNA were carried out according to a procedure by Couttet et al. (18Couttet P. Fromont-Racine M. Steel D. Pictet R. Grange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5628-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). 5 μg of circularized RNAs was used for reverse transcription using agstD1-specific primer 5′-GCGGATCCTTGGCGGTCATGATCACGGAGC-3′. The resulting cDNA reaction mixture was boiled for 5 min and then digested with a mixture of RNase A and RNase T1. The treated cDNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. One percent of the recovered cDNA was taken for PCR amplification, using 1 unit of Pfx DNA polymerase and the primer pair, 5′-GCGGATCCTTGGCGGTCATGATCACGGAGC-3′ and 5′-GCGAGCTCTCCCGGATGGGAGGAGAACTGGGC-3′, as instructed by Invitrogen. The PCR product was digested, gel-purified, and then cloned intoBamHI-SacI-digested pSP64(A). Two clones were randomly selected for sequencing to determine the 5′ and 3′ end sequences of the gstD1 mRNA. Finally, Southern blot analysis was carried out with 5′-end-labeled oligo(dT)18 to determine the length of the poly(A) of each mRNA (19Boissonneault G. Tremplay R.R. Biosci. Rep. 1990; 10: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Based on sequencing results obtained for the cRT-PCR clones, the 5′-UTR of gstD1 mRNA spans 64 nucleotides, and primer extension yielded multiple bands, marking D1 mRNAs with 5′-UTR sequences of 67, 66, 64, 63, 61, and 60 nucleotides in length (data not shown). Two cRT-PCR clones were sequenced. One had a 5′-UTR of 63 nucleotides, the other, one of 64 nucleotides. The 3′-UTR of gstD1 mRNA is 132–135 nucleotides long, with variation because of uncertain cleavage over a stretch of As in the genomic sequence (20Toung Y.-P.S. Hsieh T.-s. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Total RNAs from control or PB-treated flies yielded cRT-PCR products of gstD1 mRNA. Moreover, they did so regardless of decapitation by tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, indicating the presence of uncapped D1 mRNA (Fig. 2). The presence of multiple primer extension products of varying size supports the notion that somegstD1 mRNAs are uncapped and missing a few nucleotides at the 5′ end. In contrast, the same preparations of RNAs yielded no cRT-PCR products for gstD21 in the absence of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase when a D21 primer pair was used under the same set of experimental conditions (data not shown). This affirms that a small contingent of stable, uncapped gstD1 mRNA exists among a capped majority population whose molecules have an average of ∼40 As at the 3′ ends under both control and PB treatment conditions. The uncapped and shorter than full-length gstD1 mRNA molecules with short poly(A) tails are probably decay intermediates stabilized by a stabilizer element (Ref. 9Ruiz-Echevarrı́a M.J. Munshi R. Tomback J. Goss Kinzy T. Peltz S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30995-31003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). Despite a slow transcription rate, gstD1 mRNA is relatively abundant under control conditions. In contrast,gstD21 mRNA, which has a faster transcription rate thangstD1, holds at barely detectable levels in the same environment. gstD1 mRNA must therefore be significantly more stable than gstD21 mRNA under control conditions (15Tang A.H. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13819-13825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We observe that the coding sequence alone of gstD21 was stable as part of a chimeric RNA with the 5′-UTR ofhsp70 and the 3′-UTR of act5C (i.e.transgene D21L-UTR, Fig. 3 B). Thus, we attribute the instability of gstD21 mRNA to the influence of a cis-acting, destabilizing element in the UTRs. This association reflects the current paradigm that mRNA stability depends largely upon the strength of its destabilizing element (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). We were surprised to observe, then, that contrary to the standing model, chimeric D1 mRNA, which contains only the D1 coding sequence, was actually very labile (Fig. 3 C) in the same heterologous UTR contexts (i.e. D1-UTR) in which chimeric D21L-UTR mRNA was stable. To test the effect of nonspecific 3′ extension on D1-UTR mRNA stability, we added the FLAGTM sequence (GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG) at the 3′ end of the D1 coding region to yield transgenic line D1F-UTR. We used RPA to compare the mRNA expression levels of three chimeric constructs: D1F-UTR (D1F-UTR = D1 coding sequence with FLAGTM tag minus the native UTRs ofgstD1 mRNA); D1-UTR, the same sequence minus the FLAGTM; and D21L-UTR, the D21L sequence minus the native UTRs. Whereas chimeric D21L-UTR mRNA expression was induced to a great extent by 1 h of heat shock at 35 °C (Fig.3 B), the same treatment reduced chimeric D1-UTR mRNA to barely detectable levels (Fig. 3 C). Also, under the same conditions, control endogenous gstD1 mRNA levels were elevated 1.8 ± 0.4-fold by heat shock (Fig. 3 C). Results of shortened heat shock treatments (of incubation lasting 5–40 min at 35 °C) showed that this chimeric D1F-UTR mRNA was inducible by heat shock but yielded very labile product (Fig.3 D). Chimeric D1F-UTR mRNA levels increased with the duration of heat shock for up to 40 min, but always remained much lower than those of endogenous gstD1 mRNA (Fig. 3,C and D). Thus, this particular nonspecific 3′ end extension to the D1 coding sequence did not sufficiently replace the function of the native 3′-UTR sequence. The critical difference between the endogenous gstD1 mRNA and the transgenic D1 mRNAs, from D1-UTR and D1F-UTR, is in the presence or absence of native gstD1 UTRs. We had previously observed that endogenous gstD1 mRNA is stable under both control and PB treatment conditions (15Tang A.H. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13819-13825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given the current paradigm of mRNA stability, we did not anticipate the relative instability of the transgenic D1 mRNAs. These unexpected results strongly suggest that the coding region ofgstD1 mRNA contains one or more cryptic destabilizing element(s), which exert their influence in the absence of the native UTRs. Recalling that D1 and D21 coding sequences share 70% sequence identity (Ref. 22Toung Y.-P.S. Hsieh T.-s. Tu C.-P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and Fig. 1), and given how the chimeric D21L-UTR mRNA, which contains the D21 coding region, is stable, we set out to localize these suspect destabilizingcis-acting elements in gstD1 mRNA and observe their destabilizing effect on an otherwise stable sequence. We constructed two pairs of chimeric D1-D21 genes, and established corresponding transgenic lines for each (D1-66-D21 and D1-171-D21 for D1-D21 chimeras; D21-65-D1 and D21-170-D1 for D21-D1 chimeras, see “Experimental Procedures” for nomenclature of chimeric genes). Each of the induced chimeric RNAs was analyzed by RPA with antisense D21 and D1 riboprobes. Results are shown in Figs.4, B–E, and 5,B–E, respectively. The D21 probe detected an RNA band of ∼450 nt (Fig. 4 B, D1–66-D21) from the total RNAs of transgene D1–66-D21; the D1 probe, however, failed to detect anything (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5RPA analysis of chimeric D1-D21 mRNAs by full-length gstD1 riboprobe. Panel A, diagrams of chimeric D1-D21 mRNAs in the context of the 5′-UTR ofhsp70 and the 3′-UTR of actin 5C (not shown).Cross-hatched and open rectangles represent D1 and D21 coding sequences, respectively. Regions of overlap with thecross-hatched segments are protected in the RPA. The coordinates of the gstD1 mRNA sequence are identified in the D1 portion of each chimeric gene. Panels B-E, total RNAs from transgenic lines D1-66-D21 (B), D21-65-D1 (C), D1-171-D21 (D), and D21-170-D1 (E) were hybridized with D1.AS.SacI and RP49.AS.SacI riboprobes. Heat shock (HS) was carried out at 35 °C for the times indicated above each panel. Each RPA product band is labeled to the right of each panel. Endo-D1 represents protection product from endogenousgstD1 mRNA (824 nt) and, transgene, that from the various chimeric D1-D21 mRNA. The protected fragment from transgene D21–65-D1 is 418 nt and from transgene D1-171-D21 is 516 nt. The protected bands from RP-49 are 400 and 300 nt, respectively. No protection product was detected in the other two transgenic lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results suggest that the chimeric D1–66-D21 mRNA was unstable, particularly in the 201-nucleotide region of D1 (codons numbers 1–67). A time course analysis of heat shock induction (Fig.4 B, D1–66-D21) revealed that the chimeric mRNA was induced as soon as the inside of the experiment bottle reached 32 °C, between 5 and 10 min inside the 35 °C oven. This protected band from the D21 segment appeared exclusively for the transgene D1–66-D21 and was not observed in other transgenic or nontransgenic lines. The D1 portion, on the other hand, for which no band showed, probably degraded rapidly (Fig. 5 B, D1–66-D21). Because the stable D21 component lies downstream from the D1 region in the chimeric mRNA (D1–66-D21), we know that degradation of the D1 sequence cannot be caused by 3′ → 5′ exonucleases from the poly(A) end (23Hsu C.L. Stevens A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4826-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 24Jacobs Anderson J.S. Parker R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 25Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In analyses of other chimeric mRNAs, the full-length D21 probe protected multiple fragments of the chimeric D21-170-D1 RNA (Figs.4 E and 5 E). But this same probe protected only one fragment, and which was smaller than expected, in chimeric D21-65-D1 mRNA (Figs. 4 C and 5 C), and three very small fragments in D1-171-D21 mRNA (Figs. 4 D and5 D). Recalling that endogenous gstD21 mRNAs are not induced by heat shock, the protected D21 subfragments must trace to the induced chimeric mRNAs. The D1 riboprobe clearly protected endogenous gstD1 mRNA but as for the D1 portions of chimeric mRNAs yielded protection products at low to undetectable levels. No bands appeared for the D1-66-D21 and D21-170-D1 constructs (Fig. 5, B andE), and the D1 portions of chimeric mRNAs from D21-65-D1 and D1-171-D21 were detectable but only at very low levels (Fig. 5,C and D). Our results show these four D1-D21 (D21-D1) chimeric RNAs to be very labile, conceivably because of the presence of destabilizing D1 sequences. The instability of these chimeras was manifest very early into heat shock induction, with some decay intermediates appearing before induced chimeric mRNAs could be detected (Fig. 4, D and E). These decay intermediates were not generated during RNA isolation but, rather, increased along with the duration of heat shock. Meanwhile the reference RP-49 mRNAs remained intact throughout our time course analysis. Results in Figs. 4 and 5 along with the demonstrated stability of the chimeric D21L-UTR mRNA (Fig. 3 B), support the notion that the gstD1 coding sequence contains cryptic destabilizing elements. These cis-acting elements apparently exert their degradative influence in the absence of the native UTRs from the mRNA. A conceivable explanation, then, for how full-lengthgstD1 mRNA maintains its stability is that the UTRs contain a dominant STE(D1) that overrides any destabilizing influence from the coding region. This hypothesis, substantially supported by our findings, expands the current paradigm of mRNA stability regulation with this new detail of an additional stabilizer element. We set out to identify a decay pattern for the D21 portion of the chimeric D21-D1 mRNAs by mapping the decay intermediates of each molecule from D21-65-D1, D1-171-D21, and D21-170-D1 flies with a nested set of D21 riboprobes. (We passed over the D1 portion because its intermediates were barely detectable.) RPA results are shown in Fig.6. The decay intermediate from D21-65-D1 (Fig. 6 A, Int-Sa) spanned ∼100 nucleotides of the D21 sequence (numbers 81–181 of the 198 nucleotides from codons 1 to 66). The D1 portion of chimeric D21-65-D1 mRNA was barely detectable and only so very early into heat shock treatment (Fig.5 C). Three pieces of decay intermediates spanning ∼50, 55, and 60 nucleotides were detected from D1-171-D21 by the D21 probe (Fig.6 A, Int-1, Int-2, andInt-3). As the sum of these lengths exceeds the entire D21 stretch (129 nt, numbers 567–696 of the complete gstD21(L) mRNA) of the chimeric mRNA; they must partially overlap. Decay of the D21 part of the chimeric D21-170-D1 mRNA probably involves an endonucleolytic cleavage near the SmaI site (number 228 of the gstD21(L) sequence).2 One major decay intermediate (Int-1 in Fig. 4 E and fragments marked by arrows in Fig. 6 B) was mapped to the region of 81–547 of the D21 mRNA sequence, another intermediate (Int-2) to the region of 245–460, and a third (Int-3 in Fig. 4 E and Int-3-Sa in Fig.6 B) to the region of 81–245 (Fig. 6, B andC). The early appearance of stable decay intermediates from the induced transgene(s) indicates that the half-lives of the intact chimeric D21-D1 mRNAs are shorter than 20 min (Figs. 4 and 5). Given that the half-life of chimeric D21L-UTR mRNA in the same context of UTRs is much longer (Fig. 3 B),2dramatically shorter half-lives for the D21-D1 chimeras strongly suggests, then, that the D1 coding sequence contains active destabilizing elements. The summary of mapping results (Fig.6 C) suggests that these destabilizing elements most likely are located in the first 67, and the last 37, codons of the D1 coding sequence. Chimeric RNAs containing these sequences are either undetectable (transgenes D1-66-D21 and D21-170-D1) or detectable only at very low levels (transgenes D21-65-D1 and D1-171-D21). These destabilizing elements are suppressed in endogenous gstD1 mRNA, which must contain the proposed dominant stabilizer element STE(D1) in its native UTRs. mRNA stability is an important regulatory factor in gene expression. The relative stability of mRNA determines its lifespan and thus, its translatability, in the cytoplasm (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 4Hargrove J.L.

Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Endogenous gstD1 mRNA is quite stable under both control and PB treatment conditions. A ∼2-fold PB-induced increase in the transcription rate of gstD1 accordingly resulted in a ∼2-fold increase in the steady-state level of gstD1 mRNA (15Tang A.H. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13819-13825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). How, then, does stable gstD1 mRNA return to normal levels after the PB inducer is removed from the flies? The presence of cryptic, cis-acting, destablizing elements in the coding region of gstD1 provides a possible avenue. Just how they exert their influence, however, remains to be elucidated. In the absence of their native UTRs, D1 portions of the D1-D21 chimeric RNAs were shown not only to be degraded themselves, but also to destabilize segments of the D21 coding sequence that we know is stable in the absence of its native UTRs (Figs. 3 and 4). Mapped decay intermediates from the chimeric D1-D21 mRNAs display patterns that are consistent with the hypothesis that the destabilizing elements are, most likely, located in the N-terminal (codons 1–67) and C-terminal (codons 172–209) regions of the GST D1 coding sequence. It also indicates that endonucleolytic cleavage(s) are probably involved in the decay pathway(s). The stability of endogenous gstD1 mRNA, therefore, must rely on a dominant STE that overrides these destabilizing elements. The fact that both chimeric D1 mRNAs from transgenes D1-UTR and D1F-UTR, which lack native UTRs, are both very labile is strong evidence that this putative STE(D1) resides in the UTRs ofgstD1 mRNA. The presence of STE(D1) may also explain the occurrence of a small fraction of stable, decapped, and shorter than full-length gstD1 mRNAs in control and PB-treated RNA populations (see Fig. 2). Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed that decapping triggered poly(A)-shortening leads to 5′ → 3′ exonucleolytic degradation (26Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 27Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This pathway of mRNA decay has also been detected in mammalian cells (18Couttet P. Fromont-Racine M. Steel D. Pictet R. Grange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5628-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). If this same pathway also persists in D. melanogaster then the presence of stable decapped gstD1 mRNA would indeed be impossible without the function of a stabilizer element. The P-STE stabilizer, found in the coding region of the yeast PGK1 mRNA has been shown to block deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay (9Ruiz-Echevarrı́a M.J. Munshi R. Tomback J. Goss Kinzy T. Peltz S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30995-31003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The short poly(A) (∼40 As) of the intact molecules and presence of decapped gstD1 mRNA in the natural population suggest that the putative STE(D1) functions similarly to the yeast P-STE by blocking 5′ → 3′ exonucleolytic degradation. STEs are a known feature of yeast and mammalian mRNAs (6Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8123-8132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30995-31003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Several yeast mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames in the 5′-UTR are degraded through nonsense-mediated decay (3Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 8Ruiz-Echevarrı́a M.J. Peltz S.W. Cell. 2000; 101: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28). But for certain genes, such as GCN4 and YAP1, mRNAs are known to harbor a stabilizer element in the 5′-UTR just upstream of the main open reading frame. In GCN4 mRNA this STE protects the molecule from rapid decay by interacting with the RNA-binding protein Pub1p, which is required in the nonsense-mediated decay pathway (8Ruiz-Echevarrı́a M.J. Peltz S.W. Cell. 2000; 101: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our findings provide solid evidence that such a STE(D1) works similarly on the mRNA of a multicellular eukaryotic organism. Moreover, this STE would be similarly located to the stabilizer element of the α-globin mRNA if it should fall in the 3′-UTR of gstD1 mRNA (6Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8123-8132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). There is, however, no pyrimidine-rich segment in gstD1 UTRs as there is in the 3′-UTR of α-globin mRNA (7Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Drosophila gstD1 and gstD21 genes are adjacently located but divergently transcribed (20Toung Y.-P.S. Hsieh T.-s. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9737-9746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although their coding sequences share 70% identity, their products perform very different enzymatic functions. GST D1 is a 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(P-chlorophenyl)ethane dehydrochlorinase as well as a glutathione S-transferase. GST D21, on the other hand, does not exhibit normal GST activity (12Tang A.H. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27876-27884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but may be an important ligand-binding protein (i.e.ligandin). The UTRs of both the gstD1 and gstD21 mRNAs appear to contain cis-acting regulatory element(s), but ones which function quite differently. The native UTRs of the gstD1 mRNA are essential to the stability of the molecule, whereas those of gstD21 mRNA contain one or more element(s) that render the molecule very unstable in the absence of PB.2 The coding regions ofgstD1 and gstD21 also exhibit contrasting behaviors with respect to mRNA stability. In the same context of the hsp70 5′-UTR and the actin5C 3′-UTR, we observe that, on the one hand, the D21 coding sequence remains very stable (Fig. 3 B), but that, on the other, the D1 coding sequence becomes very labile. The stark differences in behavior betweengstD1 mRNA and gstD21 mRNA with regard to stability show the potential for diversity in yet another aspect of expression regulation within a multigene family.
