https://openalex.org/W2955503846,"We present the largest exome sequencing study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to date (n = 35,584 total samples, 11,986 with ASD). Using an enhanced analytical framework to integrate de novo and case-control rare variation, we identify 102 risk genes at a false discovery rate of 0.1 or less. Of these genes, 49 show higher frequencies of disruptive de novo variants in individuals ascertained to have severe neurodevelopmental delay, whereas 53 show higher frequencies in individuals ascertained to have ASD; comparing ASD cases with mutations in these groups reveals phenotypic differences. Expressed early in brain development, most risk genes have roles in regulation of gene expression or neuronal communication (i.e., mutations effect neurodevelopmental and neurophysiological changes), and 13 fall within loci recurrently hit by copy number variants. In cells from the human cortex, expression of risk genes is enriched in excitatory and inhibitory neuronal lineages, consistent with multiple paths to an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance underlying ASD."

To date, large-scale profiling of cell line collections including the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) has focused primarily on genetic information whereas deep interrogation of the proteome has remained out of reach. Here, we expand the CCLE through quantitative profiling of thousands of proteins by mass spectrometry across 375 cell lines from diverse lineages to reveal information undiscovered by DNA and RNA methods. We observe unexpected correlations within and between pathways that are largely absent from RNA. An analysis of microsatellite instable (MSI) cell lines reveals the dysregulation of specific protein complexes associated with surveillance of mutation and translation. These and other protein complexes were associated with sensitivity to knockdown of several different genes. These data in conjunction with the wider CCLE are a broad resource to explore cellular behavior and facilitate cancer research."

Injury to adult lung elicits activation of various cell types to repair the epithelium, depending on the type and severity of the injury (Chen, 2017Chen J.

In the lung, almost all cell types can re-enter the cell cycle and display some degree of motility to promote barrier reconstitution. Yet small populations of stem/progenitor cells with multipotency are known to expand after major injury to either conducting airways or the alveoli. In the injured lung parenchyma, both remaining type II cells (AEC2s) and stem/progenitors emanating from distal airways contribute importantly to alveolar repair (Barkauskas et al., 2013Barkauskas C.E.

In addition, relying on the use of lineage tracing using the club cell marker secretoglobin 1A1 (Scgb1a1), dedifferentiation, or transdifferentiation of club cells as the source of stem/progenitor cell population in the distal lung has been reported (McConnell et al., 2016McConnell A.M.

Indeed, under some conditions, Scgb1a1-traced cells are observed to dedifferentiate to basal cells that then expand and promote repair (Tata et al., 2013Tata P.R. Mou H. Pardo-Saganta A. Zhao R. Prabhu M. Law B.M. Vinarsky V. Cho J.L. Breton S. Sahay A. et al.Dedifferentiation of committed epithelial cells into stem cells in vivo.Nature. 2013; 503: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that dedifferentiation of mature lung cell types is a major pathway of epithelial stem/progenitor cell expansion, analogous to similar paradigms in other species (Brawley and Matunis, 2004Brawley C.

Cells keep a memory of their tissue origin during axolotl limb regeneration.Nature. 2009; 460: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). However, it has been observed that mature lineage tracers, such as Sox2 or Scgb1a1, label a more heterogeneous group of cells than previously appreciated, raising the possibility that small populations of stem/progenitors could be hiding under the tracing umbrella of a mature lineage. Therefore, it remains unclear whether fully mature cells dedifferentiate and repopulate the epithelium as a major paradigm or, somewhat like adult muscle (Relaix and Zammit, 2012Relaix F. Zammit P.S. Satellite cells are essential for skeletal muscle regeneration: the cell on the edge returns centre stage.Development. 2012; 139: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), there exists a specialized stem/progenitor population in the distal lung airways with preferential ability to expand, migrate, and differentiate toward other mature cell types in the event of major injury. We observe that Scgb1a1 lineage tracing marks at least three types of mature lung epithelial cells in an uninjured adult murine lung as well as unstained cells of uncertain origin or function (Figure 3). Therefore, to understand the source of regenerative activity of an airway epithelium, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of club-like cells searching for cells enriched with a progenitor gene signature. We report identification of a specialized progenitor population that is labeled by mature lineages (Sox2 and Scgb1a1) but remain quiescent in a normal and uninjured murine lung. These cells are not fully differentiated and are not bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) by the virtue of their in situ localization and lack of surfactant protein C expression or p63+ cells previously reported to expand after viral injury (Vaughan et al., 2015Vaughan A.E. Brumwell A.N. Xi Y. Gotts J.E. Brownfield D.G. Treutlein B. Tan K. Tan V. Liu F.C.

Spatial-temporal lineage restrictions of embryonic p63+ progenitors establish distinct stem cell pools in adult airways.Dev. Cell. 2018; 44: 752-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that these specialized progenitor cells are characterized by high levels of antigen-presenting genes, can be isolated by high expression of MHC class I marker H2-K1, and account for in vitro and in vivo regenerative activity of the lineage-labeled airway epithelium and aid in functional recovery of injured mice. Along with the rare p63+ stem/progenitors previously observed mobilizing during influenza infection, these p63neg/H2-K1high cells comprise a family of stem/progenitors previously termed lineage-negative epithelial progenitors (LNEPs) that become remarkably mobilized after injury. These findings support the paradigm that pre-existing but quiescent specialized stem/progenitor cells are the major pathway for epithelial regeneration of lungs after major injury. Although Scgb1a1-creERT lineage trace labels cells with regenerative potential in vivo and has been used extensively to isolate cells that function as progenitors in in vitro organoids, the actual cells of origin of these progenitor population(s) remain unclear. That uncharacterized epithelial stem/progenitor cells may exist among mature airway epithelial cells is suggested by immunostaining of epithelial cells isolated by flow sorting on the basis of expression of integrin β4 (β4), which marks airway epithelial cells, and CD200, which excludes mature ciliated cells (Vaughan et al., 2015Vaughan A.E. Brumwell A.N. Xi Y. Gotts J.E. Brownfield D.G. Treutlein B. Tan K. Tan V. Liu F.C. Looney M.R. et al.Lineage-negative progenitors mobilize to regenerate lung epithelium after major injury.Nature. 2015; 517: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, we determined that ∼60% of the isolated cells stain for either club-cell-specific protein (SCGB1A1), the ciliated cell marker Ac-tubulin, or surfactant protein C (SPC), although ∼40% of the cells did not stain for any mature lineage markers of the airway epithelium (Figure 1A). To identify unknown cell populations within these cell types, we then performed single-cell transcriptomics analysis of EpCAM+/β4+/CD200+ cells. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plot of single cell identified 8 distinct clusters (Figures 1B and 1C). As expected, we identified a small cluster of rare distal p63+ epithelial cells (cluster 3) previously shown to be activated by influenza infection (Kumar et al., 2011Kumar P.A. Hu Y. Yamamoto Y. Hoe N.B. Wei T.S. Mu D. Sun Y. Joo L.S. Dagher R.

Another source of alveolar AEC2s is the BASCs residing at the bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ) (Kim et al., 2005Kim C.F. Jackson E.L. Woolfenden A.E. Lawrence S. Babar I. Vogel S. Crowley D.

Bronchioalveolar stem cells are a main source for regeneration of distal lung epithelia in vivo.EMBO J. 2019; 38: e102099Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The BASCs can be traced with both a club cell lineage marker Scgb1a1− and SPC-CreERT2 (Figure S1A; Liu et al., 2019Liu Q. Liu K. Cui G. Huang X. Yao S. Guo W. Qin Z. Li Y. Yang R. Pu W. et al.Lung regeneration by multipotent stem cells residing at the bronchioalveolar-duct junction.Nat. Genet. 2019; 51: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To assess the in vitro clonogenicity of mature AEC2s, the BASCs, and other β4+ airway cells as a measure of in vivo stem/progenitor potential, we established a three-dimensional organoid culture system as previously described (Barkauskas et al., 2013Barkauskas C.E. Cronce M.J. Rackley C.R. Bowie E.J. Keene D.R. Stripp B.R. Randell S.H. Noble P.W. Hogan B.L. Type 2 alveolar cells are stem cells in adult lung.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3025-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, Zacharias et al., 2018Zacharias W.J. Frank D.B. Zepp J.A. Morley M.P. Alkhaleel F.A. Kong J. Zhou S. Cantu E. Morrisey E.E. Regeneration of the lung alveolus by an evolutionarily conserved epithelial progenitor.Nature. 2018; 555: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We isolated SPC-CreERT2+/β4− cells (mature AEC2s), SPC-CreERT2+ cells (mature AEC2s and BASCs), and the β4+/SPC-CreERT2− cells (remaining airway epithelial cells) and co-cultured with mesenchymal cells as described previously and analyzed colony size on day 14 (Figures 1D and S1B). These co-cultures established that SPC-Cre-neg airway cells held the most in vitro regenerative potential among the lung epithelial cells, giving rise to SPC+/RAGE1+ alveolar colonies (Figures 1D and S1C). These findings imply that a yet to be identified subpopulation of epithelial cells possesses robust clonogenic and stem/progenitor potential, which we will focus on in the subsequent experiments. To search for additional stem/progenitor cells within the club-like cells, we re-clustered the transcriptomes of these cells using a Sox9 gene signature assigned to embryonic epithelial bud tip cells with known stem cell function (Figure 1E; Ostrin et al., 2018Ostrin E.J. Little D.R. Gerner-Mauro K.N. Sumner E.A. Ríos-Corzo R. Ambrosio E. Holt S.E. Forcioli-Conti N. Akiyama H. Hanash S.M. et al.β-Catenin maintains lung epithelial progenitors after lung specification.Development. 2018; 145 (dev160788)Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This re-clustering identified two cell populations (clusters 0 and 3) that were enriched in the Sox9-progenitor signature (Figure 1F). Cells in cluster 3 are marked by lower expression of mature lineage markers, such as Sftpc and Scgb1a1, and higher expression of several major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II genes, including H2-K1 in comparison to remaining clusters (Figures 2A and S2A). Interestingly, cells in cluster 3 have elevated expression of several genes involved in cell cycle progression while simultaneously expressing key cell cycle inhibitors Cdkn1a (p21) and Cdkn1c (p57; Figure 2B), which could explain their lack of proliferation and maintenance in quiescence in vivo. Because of the low levels of mature lineage transcripts and high levels of cell cycling genes of cluster 3 compared with all other cell clusters, we subsequently focused on characterizing cluster 3. Cells in cluster 3 are highlighted by activation of host-defense-related signaling pathways (Figures 2C and 2D). Cells in cluster 3 also express a number of genes associated with viral infection, which suggests a susceptibility to viral infection (Figure 2C). Indeed, a recent study suggested that influenza injury specifically targets β4+/CD200+ distal airway progenitors, which includes cells in cluster 3 (Gaur et al., 2011Gaur P. Munjhal A. Lal S.K. Influenza virus and cell signaling pathways.Med. Sci. Monit. 2011; 17: RA148-RA154Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Quantius et al., 2016Quantius J. Schmoldt C. Vazquez-Armendariz A.I. Becker C. El Agha E. Wilhelm J. Morty R.E. Vadász I. Mayer K.

Consistent with activation of host-defense-related signaling pathways, these cells have increased expression of interferon-regulated genes (Figure 2D). Importantly, cluster 3 cells are marked by a significantly high expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) AW112010 (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B). Therefore, we performed in situ hybridization for the lncRNA to identify cells of cluster 3 in uninjured mouse lungs. AW112010high/Scgb3a2low cells were localized to the distal airway epithelium, but there was no signal in Scgba3a2+ club cells or at the bronchioalveolar duct junctions (Figures 2E and S2C), further confirming that AW112010high cells are not BASCs. Sca-1 (Ly6a), another marker attributed to BASCs (Kim et al., 2005Kim C.F. Jackson E.L. Woolfenden A.E. Lawrence S. Babar I. Vogel S. Crowley D. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. Identification of bronchioalveolar stem cells in normal lung and lung cancer.Cell. 2005; 121: 823-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar), is expressed at varying levels in multiple clusters with some Ly6ahigh cells residing in cluster 3 (Figure S2D). Finally, ∼3% of the β4pos cells express AW112010 (Figure S2E), although cells in cluster 3 represent ∼2.2% of sequenced cells. The difference in the frequency could be due to insufficient sequencing depth, which would fail to pick up all AW112010-expressing cells. In summary, cells in cluster 3 marked by elevated expression of AW112010 and several immune response genes are identified as non-BASC airway epithelial progenitor-like cells, many of which also express Sca-1. Expression of H2-K1, an MHC class I antigen, was significantly increased in cells of cluster 3. Flow cytometry analysis showed that high expression of H2-K1 marked ∼3% of all airway epithelium (marked by β4 expression; Figure 3A) and matched with the frequency of AW112010-expressing cells. Using our earlier established 2D culturing conditions (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman H.A. Li X. Alexander J.P. Brumwell A. Lorizio W. Tan K. Sonnenberg A. Wei Y. Vu T.H. Integrin α6β4 identifies an adult distal lung epithelial population with regenerative potential in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we observed that β4+/H2-K1high cells represented the primary colony-forming cells (Figure S3A). To assess the clonogenicity of H2-K1high cells, we established a culture system to test whether H2-K1high airway epithelial cells represent the airway colony-forming epithelial cells (see STAR Methods). We cultured cells in a mesenchyme-free 3D organoid assay in lung progenitor media (Nichane et al., 2017Nichane M. Javed A. Sivakamasundari V. Ganesan M. Ang L.T. Kraus P. Lufkin T. Loh K.M. Lim B. Isolation and 3D expansion of multipotent Sox9+ mouse lung progenitors.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This media has several growth factors that are thought to be secreted by the mesenchyme in an epithelial/mesenchymal 3D organoid condition (Figure S3B). Under these conditions, β4+/H2-K1high cells represented virtually all colony-forming cells within an uninjured lung epithelium (Figure 3B). The high colony forming efficiency of these cells was maintained for at least three passages (Figure 3C). To determine the differentiation into either airway or alveolar cells, we stained either whole colonies or cytospins prepared from cultured cells. Analysis of cytospins revealed that these cells either differentiated toward SPC-expressing AEC2s (38%) or cytokeratin 5 (Krt5)-expressing basal cells (4%) although Scgb3a2+ club cells were rarely observed (<1%; Figure 3D). Likewise, whole organoids were exclusively either basal (Krt5+) or alveolar (SPC+/RAGE1+; Figure S3C), indicating majority of the H2-K1high cells formed alveolar colonies with few cells forming airway basal colonies. To assess whether H2-K1high cells clonally expanded, we mixed H2-K1high cells from either a wild-type or a Ubiquitin C (UBC)-GFP mouse, which constitutively expressed EGFP (Schaefer et al., 2001Schaefer B.C. Schaefer M.L. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Kedl R.M. Observation of antigen-dependent CD8+ T-cell/ dendritic cell interactions in vivo.Cell. Immunol. 2001; 214: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The colony-mixing experiment demonstrated that 99% of 422 organoids were either GFP+ or GFP−, indicating clonal expansion of H2-K1high progenitors (Figure S3D). Several studies have made use of Scgb1a1-CreERT lineage to label and isolate “club progenitor cells” to study their regenerative capacity in organoid assays (Lee et al., 2017Lee J.H. Tammela T.

Immunostaining of Scgb1a1-CreERT-traced cells identified at least three mature epithelial populations, including SPC+, Scgb1a1+, and Ac-Tub+, and a fraction of traced cells had undetectable levels of mature lineage markers (Figure 3E). Therefore, we tested whether H2-K1high cells are labeled by Scgb1a1-CreERT. Indeed, our analysis identified that ∼6% of Scgb1a1-CreERT-labeled airway cells (β4+) were H2-K1high, which accounted for the colony-forming cells of Scgb1a1 lineage in mesenchyme-free or previously described mesenchyme-dependent conditions (Figures 3E–3G). In summary, these experiments identified a subpopulation of cells that, by lineage tracing, appear indistinguishable from club cells but in fact have distinguishing features and represent the colony-forming cells within the club-like cells under 2D (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman H.A.

To determine whether H2-K1high cells respond to injury, we injured mice with bleomycin and assessed their response. Although H2-K1high cells in uninjured lungs are quiescent and do not proliferate (0% Edu+ cells in H2-K1high versus 1.7% Edu+ cells in H2-K1low fraction of airway cells), injury preferentially elicits a proliferative response in H2-K1high cells (11% Edu+ cells in H2-K1high versus 2% Edu+ cells in H2-K1low fraction; Figures S4A and S4B). This is reflected in expansion of H2-K1high cells and formation of large colonies during in vitro culture from days 3 to 6 (Figures 4A and S4C). By day 9, almost all of the colonies were smaller, suggesting possible differentiation. Analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of β4pos/CD200pos at 9 days post-injury and subsequent supervised clustering of these cells confirmed a larger H2-K1high cluster when compared to uninjured H2-K1high cluster (Figures 4B and S4D). Injured H2-K1high cells maintained lower levels of mature lineage markers, such as Sftpc, Scgb1a1, and Scgb3a2, in comparison to other injured mature cells (Figure 4C). However, when compared with uninjured/quiescent H2-K1high progenitors, the injured progenitors had decreased expression of multiple airway genes, whereas several alveolar genes, including Napsa, Ager, and podoplanin (Pdpn), were increased, indicating that the injured H2-K1high progenitors have adapted a more alveolar fate (Figure 4D). Injured H2-K1high cells also had upregulation of signaling pathways associated with cellular mobility, whereas mature club cells failed to mobilize after injury, as judged by the transcriptional profiles (Figure 4E), consistent with lack of proliferative response in β4pos/H2-K1low club cells (Figures S4A and S4B). Finally, bleomycin injury elicited preferential increased expression of Cdkn1a, Cdkn2a, Trp53, and Hif1a genes in H2-K1high cells that, along with differentiation,"

However, what drives mitochondrial decline during aging remains unclear. Working in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, we recently shed light on this question by showing that deterioration of the lysosome-like vacuole is an early event during yeast replicative aging and that loss of vacuole acidification underlies age-related mitochondrial dysfunction (Hughes and Gottschling, 2012Hughes A.L.

Vacuoles are acidic organelles that facilitate protein degradation, metabolic signaling, and metabolite compartmentation (Klionsky et al., 1990Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D.

Vacuolar function requires the vacuolar-H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a vacuole-membrane-localized protein complex that acidifies vacuoles by generating a proton gradient across the vacuole membrane (Forgac, 2007Forgac M.

Despite the importance of the mitochondria-lysosome connection in aging and disease, it remains unclear how these two organelles are functionally linked, as well as what function of lysosomes prevents age-related mitochondrial deterioration. Here, we address these questions by showing that defects in vacuole-dependent amino acid compartmentation hamper mitochondrial respiration by limiting the intracellular bioavailability of iron, a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory machinery. These results indicate that age-related mitochondrial deterioration is driven by amino-acid-dependent iron limitation and suggest that vacuoles promote mitochondrial health by limiting amino acid toxicity through subcellular compartmentation.

To dissect the functional connection between vacuoles and mitochondria, we utilized a high-copy plasmid genomic DNA library (Jones et al., 2008Jones G.M. Stalker J. Humphray S. West A. Cox T. Rogers J. Dunham I. Prelich G. A systematic library for comprehensive overexpression screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nat.

Our screen uncovered a single high-copy suppressor, FET4, that permitted growth on glycerol in the presence of V-ATPase inhibition (Figure 1G). In parallel, we screened the yeast non-essential gene deletion collection (Giaever et al., 2002Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Véronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A. Anderson K.

Enhanced mitochondrial function in V-ATPase-deficient rox1Δ cells required FET4, suggesting that ROX1 deletion restores mitochondrial respiration in V-ATPase-deficient cells by elevating FET4 expression (Figure 1H). Fet4 is a plasma-membrane-embedded metal permease that facilitates low-affinity iron uptake in budding yeast (Dix et al., 1994Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J.

Like FET4 overexpression, iron supplementation with exogenous ferrous ammonium sulfate restored growth of V-ATPase-deficient cells on respiratory-based carbon sources (Figures 1I and 1J). Iron supplementation also suppressed mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential defects caused by acute V-ATPase inhibition (Figures 1K–1N and S1C; Video S3). Thus, genetic or pharmacologic iron supplementation restores mitochondrial health in V-ATPase-deficient cells. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIzMTE3ZmE5MmE3ZmIwOWU2NDQ5MjI5OGFkNTYzMGVhOSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NzYzNTU4fQ.Pi3ANQb0gkWoC6GUqYKYvdJjJQ4GARj2W659CO7DgjioX_UXHUKjESt98Lbs4Af9XBUFFDa4teG4-K3KAER3-h2eK21rmK2EzhUC-frQ9zSI3dH3djs9_-QkXf4DcLP0w2UJEjyjStUM07XTlcTUPJJ1WUYnOFs_FU6gErYd97IdWVjCC-Rdwn58fs9ovGBxoLO9dempxhDpzls3szlhSFKP7ijFUsGWFFFZ1QCbWSz6olvpOYGaWoKShRohoSaNvFCcsPy8PrK-SGDL_A2_74EviAKmQXWercMV5eIVYc98zbrWA_MlSEoZx-J77Qvh2b5QjO4FMtzNTP0nvUsgew Download .mp4 (1.22 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S3. Time-Lapse Imaging Showing Iron Suppresses V-ATPase-Inhibition-Mediated Mitochondrial Structural Alterations, Related to Figures 1 and S1Maximum-intensity projection movie of yeast mitochondria visualized with Tim50-GFP. Cells were imaged every minute from 45 to 150 minutes after resuspension in imaging medium containing concA + Fe. Movie speed = 12 frames/second. Based on our above findings that iron supplementation restores mitochondrial function in V-ATPase-depleted cells and previous observations that V-ATPase inhibition causes iron starvation (Diab and Kane, 2013Diab H.I. Kane P.M. Loss of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in yeast generates an iron deprivation signal that is moderated by induction of the peroxiredoxin TSA2.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 11366-11377Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we wondered whether iron limitation causes mitochondrial dysfunction upon V-ATPase deficiency. To test this, we first evaluated the impact of V-ATPase inhibition on cellular iron metabolism by monitoring activation of the Aft1-dependent iron transcriptional regulon in V-ATPase-inhibited cells. Aft1 is a transcription factor that localizes to the nucleus upon iron deprivation and remodels iron metabolism through the induction of a set of genes known as the iron regulon (Chen et al., 2004Chen O.S.

Consistent with previous observations (Diab and Kane, 2013Diab H.I. Kane P.M.

At the indicated times, equal volumes of cells were harvested and levels of GFP tagged proteins were analyzed by western blot (bottom panel). To further investigate the connection between vacuole impairment and iron homeostasis, we generated a quantitative Aft1 transcriptional reporter composed of the Aft1-responsive FIT2 promoter (FIT2pr) driving expression of GFP, integrated into an empty region of chromosome I (Figure 2D). Aft1-dependent GFP expression was robustly activated by pharmacological or genetic V-ATPase impairment, as monitored by western blot and flow cytometry (Figures 2E, 2F, S2B, and S2C). FIT2pr-based GFP expression was induced similarly by V-ATPase inhibition and complete extracellular iron chelation with BPS, was dependent on Aft1, and was suppressed by FET4 overexpression or supplementation with either ferric (Fe3+) or ferrous (Fe2+) iron (Figures S2D–S2G). Furthermore, loss of AFT1 was lethal in V-ATPase-deficient cells, and growth was restored by iron supplementation (Figure 2G). A similar synergistic, iron-dependent lethality was observed between concA and the iron chelator BPS (Figure S2H). These results confirm that loss of V-ATPase activity limits cellular iron and activates the iron regulon, the latter of which is essential for growth in the absence of a functioning vacuole. We next examined the connection between iron limitation and mitochondrial dysfunction in V-ATPase-deficient cells. Aft1 senses intracellular iron by monitoring levels of iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) (Chen et al., 2004Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J.

https://openalex.org/W3002141543,"Cortical layer 1 (L1) interneurons have been proposed as a hub for attentional modulation of underlying cortex, but the transformations that this circuit implements are not known. We combined genetically targeted voltage imaging with optogenetic activation and silencing to study the mechanisms underlying sensory processing in mouse barrel cortex L1. Whisker stimuli evoked precisely timed single spikes in L1 interneurons, followed by strong lateral inhibition. A mild aversive stimulus activated cholinergic inputs and evoked a bimodal distribution of spiking responses in L1. A simple conductance-based model that only contained lateral inhibition within L1 recapitulated the sensory responses and the winner-takes-all cholinergic responses, and the model correctly predicted that the network would function as a spatial and temporal high-pass filter for excitatory inputs. Our results demonstrate that all-optical electrophysiology can reveal basic principles of neural circuit function in vivo and suggest an intuitive picture for how L1 transforms sensory and modulatory inputs. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W3000826358,"The testis expresses the largest number of genes of any mammalian organ, a finding that has long puzzled molecular biologists. Our single-cell transcriptomic data of human and mouse spermatogenesis provide evidence that this widespread transcription maintains DNA sequence integrity in the male germline by correcting DNA damage through a mechanism we term transcriptional scanning. We find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary timescales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions. Collectively, we propose that transcriptional scanning shapes germline mutation signatures and modulates mutation rates in a gene-specific manner, maintaining DNA sequence integrity for the bulk of genes but allowing for faster evolution in a specific subset."
https://openalex.org/W3002023792,"During spatial learning, hippocampal (HPC) place maps reorganize to represent new goal locations, but little is known about the circuit mechanisms facilitating these changes. Here, we examined how neuromodulation via locus coeruleus (LC) projections to HPC area CA1 (LC-CA1) regulates the overrepresentation of CA1 place cells near rewarded locations. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we monitored the activity of LC-CA1 fibers in the mouse dorsal HPC. We find that the LC-CA1 projection signals the translocation of a reward, predicting behavioral performance on a goal-oriented spatial learning task. An optogenetic stimulation mimicking this LC-CA1 activity induces place cell reorganization around a familiar reward, while its inhibition decreases the degree of overrepresentation around a translocated reward. Our results show that LC acts in conjunction with other factors to induce goal-directed reorganization of HPC representations and provide a better understanding of the role of neuromodulatory actions on HPC place map plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3002301481,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor progression. However, the establishment and function of the TME remain obscure because of its complex cellular composition. Using a mouse genetic system called mosaic analysis with double markers (MADMs), we delineated TME evolution at single-cell resolution in sonic hedgehog (SHH)-activated medulloblastomas that originate from unipotent granule neuron progenitors in the brain. First, we found that astrocytes within the TME (TuAstrocytes) were trans-differentiated from tumor granule neuron precursors (GNPs), which normally never differentiate into astrocytes. Second, we identified that TME-derived IGF1 promotes tumor progression. Third, we uncovered that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is produced by tumor-associated microglia in response to interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation. Finally, we found that IL-4 is secreted by TuAstrocytes. Collectively, our studies reveal an evolutionary process that produces a multi-lateral network within the TME of medulloblastoma: a fraction of tumor cells trans-differentiate into TuAstrocytes, which, in turn, produce IL-4 that stimulates microglia to produce IGF1 to promote tumor progression."

We approached this question in two ways: (1) a re-analysis of the bioinformatic data using RNA-seq datasets from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) and the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and (2) a direct interrogation of brain material for HHV-6A and HHV-6B PCR reactivity from AD patients and controls from which DNA had been extracted and that we had access to from ROSMAP (Bennett et al., 2012aBennett D.A.

The Broad Institute PathSeq tool, which screens over 25,000 microbes, including 118 human viruses, was used for RNA-seq analysis (Walker et al., 2018Walker M.A. Pedamallu C.S. Ojesina A.I. Bullman S. Sharpe T. Whelan C.W. Meyerson M. GATK PathSeq: a customizable computational tool for the discovery and identification of microbial sequences in libraries from eukaryotic hosts.Bioinformatics. 2018; 34: 4287-4289PubMed Google Scholar). PCR detection for HHV-6A and HHV-6B utilized a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) platform, which is a highly sensitive and precise novel PCR methodology that we have used extensively (Leibovitch et al., 2014Leibovitch E.C. Brunetto G.S. Caruso B. Fenton K. Ohayon J. Reich D.S. Jacobson S.

The findings of this study, using the complementary methods of PathSeq and ddPCR on samples from three independent repositories, demonstrated little difference in viral detection between AD and non-AD controls. RNA-seq datasets were available from both MSBB and ROSMAP using the AMP-AD Knowledge Portal on SYNAPSE (MSBB synapse ID: syn3157743; ROSMAP: syn3388564) (Table 1) and were filtered into the PathSeq pipeline from the Broad Institute to screen for pathogens (Walker et al., 2018Walker M.A. Pedamallu C.S.

GATK PathSeq: a customizable computational tool for the discovery and identification of microbial sequences in libraries from eukaryotic hosts.Bioinformatics. 2018; 34: 4287-4289PubMed Google Scholar). In the MSBB repository, RNA-seq data were available from 301 individuals, from which up to four different brain regions from each individual were screened for a total of 1,027 specimens (Table 1). The four brain regions included Brodmann area 10 (BM10), the anterior prefrontal cortex; Brodmann area 22 (BM22), the superior temporal gyrus; Brodmann area 36 (BM36), the parahippocampal gyrus; and Brodmann area 44 (BM44), the inferior frontal gyrus (Readhead et al., 2018Readhead B.

For both MSBB and ROSMAP repositories, brains were classified with respect to AD disease status using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) neuropathology classification, which ranks individuals in categories of “No AD,” “Possible AD,” “Probable AD,” and “Definite AD” (Table 1) (Bennett et al., 2012aBennett D.A.

In addition to RNA-seq data, we were fortunate to be able to obtain extracted DNA for ddPCR analysis from 364 brains also from the ROSMAP brain repository (although DNA from these brains did not have corresponding RNA-seq information). DNA extracted from an additional 344 brains was also made available to us from a third brain repository, the JHBRC, comprising 243 AD brains and 101 non-AD controls (Blauwendraat et al., 2019Blauwendraat C.

RNA-seq data from the MSBB cohort were available from multiple brain regions for 301 total individuals. Clinical data for each individual included neocortical plaque density across five regions (number of plaques/mm2) and clinical dementia rating (CDR) score (Wang et al., 2018Wang M. Beckmann N.D. Roussos P. Wang E. Zhou X. Wang Q. Ming C. Neff R. Ma W. Fullard J.F. et al.The Mount Sinai cohort of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data in Alzheimer’s disease.Sci. Data. 2018; 5: 180185Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which stratifies clinical symptoms of dementia by severity. When individuals were arranged by a compounded Plaque ∗ CDR score (disease severity score), it was possible to easily visualize the correlation between PathSeq results and clinical and neuropathological disease (Figure 1A). The PathSeq score, based on the number of reads that align with taxon references, indicates the amount of evidence that a taxon is present in a given sample (Walker et al., 2018Walker M.A. Pedamallu C.S. Ojesina A.I. Bullman S. Sharpe T. Whelan C.W. Meyerson M. GATK PathSeq: a customizable computational tool for the discovery and identification of microbial sequences in libraries from eukaryotic hosts.Bioinformatics. 2018; 34: 4287-4289PubMed Google Scholar). These scores, defined by the Broad Institute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/org_broadinstitute_hellbender_tools_spark_pathseq_PathSeqScoreSpark.php), are used to “detect and quantify microbe abundance. Alignments with sufficient identity score (e.g. 90% of read length) estimate read counts and the relative abundance of microorganisms present in the sample at each level of the taxonomic tree… Reads with a single valid alignment add a score of 1 to the corresponding species or strain. For reads with N hits, a score of 1/N is distributed to each organism. Scores are totaled for each taxon by summing the scores across all reads and the scores of any descendent taxa.” Pathogen load is correlated with score as score is based on RNA read counts. PathSeq scores for HHV-6 within the MSBB cohort were fairly low, with the highest score being 33.5 and most scores remaining between 0 and 10. All of the positive reads for HHV-6 fell within samples from just four out of 301 individuals, with HHV-6 found in multiple brain regions for two of those individuals (Figure 1B). There appears to be little difference in the frequency of detection between HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Of the four individuals in which any HHV-6 signal was detected, three out of four had both HHV-6A and HHV-6B, and one individual (Person 1) had only HHV-6B with a low PathSeq score of 1.0 (and the lowest disease severity score) (Figures 1A and 1B). Person 2 had a modest PathSeq score of 33.5 in the BM22 brain region for HHV-6B, and Person 3 had a likewise modest PathSeq score of 23.5 for HHV-6A also in BM22 (Figures 1A and 1B). There was no correlation between disease severity and PathSeq score (Figure 1A; R2 = 0.0016). In addition to the MSBB cohort, RNA-seq data were available from ROSMAP. The dataset included 600 individuals of varying AD classifications (Table 1). Similar to MSBB, PathSeq analysis demonstrated a low frequency of HHV-6 detection (with low PathSeq scores) in ROSMAP, with HHV-6A detected in only two brains in this cohort (Figure 1C). No HHV-6B was detected. Both ROSMAP and MSBB classified samples according to CERAD neuropathology guidelines (Bennett et al., 2012aBennett D.A. Schneider J.A. Arvanitakis Z. Wilson R.S.

This study extends organoid technology to reptilian tissues and describes an experimentally tractable model system representing the snake venom gland. Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease estimated to be responsible for >100,000 deaths worldwide each year (Gutiérrez et al., 2017Gutiérrez J.M. Calvete J.J. Habib A.G. Harrison R.A. Williams D.J. Warrell D.A. Snakebite envenoming.Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2017; 3: 17063Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Upon injection through specialized fangs, venomous snakes primarily use their venom to immobilize prey. For numerous snake species, the venom delivered by a single bite is enough to kill prey that is many times larger than the snake. During vertebrate evolution, the snake venom gland has been adapted from the salivary gland (Kochva, 1987Kochva E. The origin of snakes and evolution of the venom apparatus.Toxicon. 1987; 25: 65-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Secretory columnar cells in the gland epithelium secrete a complex mixture of peptides and proteins, stored in the lumen and channeled to the fangs through connecting ducts. Venom toxins are classified into distinct protein families with diverse modes-of-action (Fry et al., 2009Fry B.G. Vidal N. van der Weerd L. Kochva E. Renjifo C. Evolution and diversification of the Toxicofera reptile venom system.J. Proteomics. 2009; 72: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which makes them a rich source for drugs targeting human proteins (Clark et al., 2019Clark G.C. Casewell N.R. Elliott C.T.

Sci. 2019; 44: 365-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Snake venoms differ greatly in toxin composition and the architecture of the machinery involved in its production and release. Venom from viperid snakes (such as the rattlesnake) mainly consists of hemotoxic enzymes (Ainsworth et al., 2018Ainsworth S. Slagboom J. Alomran N. Pla D. Alhamdi Y. King S.I. Bolton F.M.S. Gutierrez J.M. Vonk F.J. Toh C.H. et al.The paraspecific neutralisation of snake venom induced coagulopathy by antivenoms.Commun. Biol. 2018; 1: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas elapids (such as the king cobra) typically produce smaller peptides with neurotoxic effects (Vonk et al., 2013Vonk F.J. Casewell N.R. Henkel C.V. Heimberg A.M. Jansen H.J. McCleary R.J. Kerkkamp H.M. Vos R.A. Guerreiro I.

USA. 2013; 110: 20651-20656Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Three-finger toxins (3FTxs) constitute a diverse and highly expressed class of toxins that mainly exert a neurotoxic effect through interaction with acetylcholine receptors (Tsetlin, 2015Tsetlin V.I. Three-finger snake neurotoxins and Ly6 proteins targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: pharmacological tools and endogenous modulators.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2015; 36: 109-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Kunitz-type protease inhibitors (KUNs) also exert neurotoxic activities, although some are anticoagulant (Harvey, 2001Harvey A.L. Twenty years of dendrotoxins.Toxicon. 2001; 39: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, Millers et al., 2009Millers E.K. Trabi M. Masci P.P. Lavin M.F. de Jersey J. Guddat L.W.

Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) proteins can act as myotoxins or neurotoxins and display antiplatelet activities (Gutierrez and Lomonte, 2013Gutierrez J.M. Lomonte B. Phospholipases A2: unveiling the secrets of a functionally versatile group of snake venom toxins.Toxicon. 2013; 62: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) block smooth muscle contraction (Yamazaki and Morita, 2004Yamazaki Y. Morita T. Structure and function of snake venom cysteine-rich secretory proteins.Toxicon. 2004; 44: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Finally, snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), L-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs), and C-type lectins (CTLs) mostly disrupt blood coagulation (Slagboom et al., 2017Slagboom J. Kool J. Harrison R.A. Casewell N.R. Haemotoxic snake venoms: their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promise.Br. J. Haematol. 2017; 177: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Izidoro et al., 2014Izidoro L.F. Sobrinho J.C. Mendes M.M. Costa T.R. Grabner A.N. Rodrigues V.M. da Silva S.L. Zanchi F.B.

Much still needs to be learned about toxin production and release cycles, heterogeneity of venom-producing cells, and factors influencing venom composition. Organoids are defined as self-organizing 3D structures that can be grown from stem cells and that recapitulate essential features of the tissue under study (Clevers, 2016Clevers H. Modeling Development and Disease with Organoids.Cell. 2016; 165: 1586-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). We originally showed that a serum-free medium containing R-spondin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and Noggin suffices to support the growth of mouse Lgr5+ intestinal ASCs into ever-expanding epithelial organoids. These “mini-guts” contain all known cell types of the gut lining (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J.

Subsequently, similar R-spondin-based protocols have been reported for a wide diversity of healthy and diseased mammalian epithelia (Artegiani and Clevers, 2018Artegiani B. Clevers H.

Little is known about the biology of adult stem cells in reptiles. Different short-term culture systems have been described for snake venom glands (Sells et al., 1989Sells P.G. Hommel M. Theakston R.D. Venom production in snake venom gland cells cultured in vitro.Toxicon. 1989; 27: 1245-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, Carneiro et al., 2006Carneiro S.M. Zablith M.B.

Venom production in long-term primary culture of secretory cells of the Bothrops jararaca venom gland.Toxicon. 2006; 47: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), yet long-term cultures capturing structural and functional properties of the snake venom gland have not been developed. Here, we aim to establish long-term culture conditions for functional snake venom gland epithelium using R-spondin-based organoid technology. Venom glands from nine different snake species, representing members of both the Elapidae (Naja pallida, Naja annulifera, Naja nivea, Naja atra, and Aspidelaps lubricus cowlesi) and Viperidae (Echis ocellatus, Deinagkistrodon acutus, Crotalus atrox, and Bitis arietans) families, were dissociated and embedded in basement membrane extract (BME) at 32°C (Figure 1A). Supplying a medium containing a “generic” mammalian organoid cocktail (see below) resulted in initial expansion of organoids for all species (Figures 1B and S1A) (some were subsequently lost due to bacterial contamination, insensitive to the antibiotics used). Passaging yielded expanding organoids that histologically resembled the original gland epithelium (Figure 1C). The venom gland organoids could be expanded optimally using R-spondin (the Wnt signal-amplifying ligand of Lgr5) (de Lau et al., 2011de Lau W. Barker N. Low T.Y. Koo B.K. Li V.S. Teunissen H. Kujala P. Haegebarth A. Peters P.J. van de Wetering M. et al.Lgr5 homologues associate with Wnt receptors and mediate R-spondin signalling.Nature. 2011; 476: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), the BMP inhibitor Noggin, EGF, the small molecule TGF beta inhibitor A83-01, PGE2, and FGF10 (Figures 1D and S1B). This “expansion medium” controls the same cellular signaling pathways that are required for mammalian epithelial organoids (Fatehullah et al., 2016Fatehullah A. Tan S.H. Barker N. Organoids as an in vitro model of human development and disease.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Reptilian organoid expansion was only successful at lower temperatures (Figure S1C), consistent with the average body temperature of poikilotherm species such as snakes. When cultured at 37°C, the standard for mammalian cells, a heat shock response (HSPA8) was observed within 2 h, which is described to preclude cell division, and consequently prohibited organoid growth (Richter et al., 2010Richter K. Haslbeck M. Buchner J. The heat shock response: life on the verge of death.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 253-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) (Figure S1D). The proliferating cells self-organized into cystic spheres lined by a simple polarized epithelium (Figure 1E; Video S1), while budding of organoids was occasionally observed. Under these conditions, organoids expanded exponentially for >20 passages without significant changes in growth kinetics or morphology (Figure 1B).

DAPI (orange), beta-catenin (red), tubulin (green), and actin (blue). Simultaneous withdrawal of all growth factors (with the exception of PGE2 to maintain cystic organoids) for 7 days resulted in less-proliferative organoids (Figure 2A). These organoids contained highly polarized cells with secretory vesicles, described previously as the main producers of venom in the snake venom gland (Mackessy, 1991Mackessy S.P. Morphology and ultrastructure of the venom glands of the northern pacific rattlesnake Crotalus viridis oreganus.J. Morphol. 1991; 208: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). Furthermore, ciliated cells could occasionally be observed by electron microscopy (Figure S1F). High-speed imaging captured functionally beating cilia in a subset of organoids (Video S2). Based on these features of apparently mature and functional cell types, we defined this cultured condition as our “differentiation” cocktail. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI4NWViOThjNWRjMzQyYWUzZDA0YjA4ZjMyNjI0N2EzMCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NzM4Njk2fQ.lGJUR_vN3UpuNYACn0cogvG_CHmPuXsqBmXGxz_aySnAZbZuxzencu20C3dVdMJHZ_8MAdRfpj1EEsElVdnzsy7rBlpwr06MOnjl27cl8pjVszW1rObncnu53EE1CKiDKCAK-As7MzW4Tvoo4G5sj4k_9--TLC8pB0m_aEvlOoDEIVFVKTwSGGhGrIIM64ZOYIq1KcwiqgOq4hRsnD3tOFQQrqzXIdPFP_JuVyM-MskRP7owvF1dh-Mtlby71K2W93sZ7R16f8ILiIvlb9u_AS8876irc_pvnXSml_2nGCGFTKTTg1YAHzU8kArdyjWohA78zawehXm061QxsBR59A Download .mp4 (6.74 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2. Functionally Beating Cilia in VGO (20× Objective, 20 Frames/s), Related to Figures 2 and S1 Snake venom contains dozens to hundreds of different bioactive compounds (Fox and Serrano, 2008Fox J.W. Serrano S.M. Exploring snake venom proteomes: multifaceted analyses for complex toxin mixtures.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). No annotated genome exists for A. l. cowlesi. To gain deeper insight into the expression of individual toxin-encoding genes, we assembled a de novo transcriptome of A. l. cowlesi using Trinity (Haas et al., 2013Haas B.J. Papanicolaou A. Yassour M. Grabherr M. Blood P.D. Bowden J. Couger M.B. Eccles D. Li B. Lieber M. et al.De novo transcript sequence reconstruction from RNA-seq using the Trinity platform for reference generation and analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 1494-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). Libraries of contigs (311,948) generated from late-embryonic liver, pancreas, and venom gland as well as from venom gland organoids were used to determine gene-expression levels for each of the three tissues as well as the venom gland organoids. The organoid transcriptome showed toxins to represent the dominant class of expressed genes, while homologs of established markers of mammalian liver and pancreas were restricted to their corresponding organ (Figure 2D). Toxin expression in venom gland tissue was markedly lower compared to organoids, most likely due to presence of non-epithelial cells in gland tissue. Among the toxins, 3FTxs were most abundant (Figure 2E). We also detected expression of CRISPs, SVMPs, and KUNs (Figures 2E and S1G). The relative abundance of these toxin classes matched the venom gland tissue at transcriptome level and the crude venom composition at protein level (Whiteley et al., 2019Whiteley G. Casewell N.R. Pla D. Quesada-Bernat S. Logan R.A.E. Bolton F.M.S. Wagstaff S.C. Gutiérrez J.M. Calvete J.J. Harrison R.A. Defining the pathogenic threat of envenoming by South African shield-nosed and coral snakes (genus Aspidelaps), and revealing the likely efficacy of available antivenom.J. Proteomics. 2019; 198: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Figure 2E). Of note, the 7-day differentiation protocol increased overall toxin gene expression but reduced the expression of CRISP (Figures 2D and 2E). We concluded that A. l. cowlesi organoids produced a near-normal spectrum of venom factors. To further demonstrate the long-term propagation capacity of adult venom-gland-derived cells using our protocol, we expanded organoids from Naja nivea, the Cape cobra. Venom glands from a euthanized adult individual (>1-year-old) were dissociated and cultured using the same conditions as used above (Figure 3A). Organoids recapitulated the epithelial phenotype and were expanded for over 18 passages (Figures 3A and 3B). While cells were viable and proliferating in “expansion medium,” we noticed reduced swelling (smaller lumen) in N. nivea organoids making it more difficult to mechanically split these cultures. Upon additional activation of cyclic AMP using forskolin (FSK), organoids exhibited improved swelling allowing easier splitting (Figure 3C). For further passaging (after passage 5) of N. nivea organoids, we supplemented expansion medium with FSK. Forskolin-induced swelling is well known in primary human intestinal organoids, where it is used to monitor the ability to transport chloride ions (Dekkers et al., 2013Dekkers J.F. Wiegerinck C.L. de Jonge H.R. Bronsveld I. Janssens H.M. de Winter-de Groot K.M. Brandsma A.M. de Jong N.W. Bijvelds M.J. Scholte B.J. et al.A functional CFTR assay using primary cystic fibrosis intestinal organoids.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Exposure to “differentiation medium,” including the withdrawal of FSK resulted in the expected phenotype of less proliferative organoids (Figure 3D) accompanied by increased expression of 3FTx and KUN by qPCR (Figure 3E). To establish a “deep” gene expression profile, we performed bulk mRNA sequencing of N. nivea organoids in differentiation medium. PolyA enriched reads could be mapped to the de novo A. l. cowlesi transcriptome (Figure 2C). We thus identified a number of putative toxins enriched in organoids from N. nivea, such as beta-bungarotoxin-like, kappa-bungarotoxin-like, and sarafotoxin-like (Figure 3F). 3FTxs are the main venom components of elapid snakes. Utilizing the high sequence conservation of 3FTX, we were able to PCR-amplify the coding sequence of several variants starting from A. l. cowlesi and N. nivea organoid cDNA (Figure 3G). When translating these 3FTX coding sequences in silico, we detected peptide sequences that have not been described before in the NCBI database and are specific to the individual species (Figure 3H). Because our access to A. l. cowlesi venom gland material was more regular (one clutch a year), we focused our further characterization on organoid lines derived from A. l. cowlesi. The cellular heterogeneity of the venom gland epithelium has largely been described morphologically. We have recently demonstrated the usefulness of organoids for the detailed delineation of cell lineages in the enteroendocrine compartment of the gut (Beumer et al., 2018Beumer J. Artegiani B. Post Y. Reimann F. Gribble F. Nguyen T.N. Zeng H. Van den Born M. Van Es J.H. Clevers H. Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Using a similar strategy, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of organoids in expansion and differentiation medium and compared it to their primary tissue counterparts obtained from A. l. cowlesi late embryonic venom gland. From organoids, a total of 1,536 cells were sorted, processed using the SORT-seq method (Muraro et al., 2016Muraro M.J. Dharmadhikari G. Grun D. Groen N. Dielen T. Jansen E. van Gurp L.

Sagar Grün D. FateID infers cell fate bias in multipotent progenitors from single-cell RNA-seq data.Nat. Methods. 2018; 15: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Reads were mapped to the de novo assembled A. l. cowlesi transcriptome, processed using a newly generated pipeline and filtered for >2,000 transcripts per cell. The 1,092 cells that passed the thresholds displayed a median expression of 10,480 transcript counts per cell (Figures S2A and S2B). K-medoids-based clustering compartmentalized the cells into 12 different cell clusters, as visualized by t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (Figure 4A). Cells derived from expansion and differentiation medium clustered mostly separately (Figure 4B). Expression of one of the most abundant 3FTxs (Pr-SNTX) (Figure S1G) revealed the presence of at least 4 cell clusters producing venom factors (Figure 4C). In line with the bulk transcriptome data, the vast majority of venom-producing cells were derived from differentiated organoids.Figure 4Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis of Organoids and Primary Tissue Reveals Distinct Venom Gland Cell TypesShow full caption(A) Single-cell RNA sequencing: clustering of A. l. cowlesi venom gland organoid cells (n = 1092) visualized by t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor-Embedding (t-SNE) map.

https://openalex.org/W3001658708,"In vertebrates, specific command centers in the brain can selectively drive slow-explorative or fast-speed locomotion. However, it remains unclear how the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) processes descending drive into coordinated locomotion. Here, we reveal, in adult zebrafish, a logic of the V2a interneuron rhythm-generating circuits involving recurrent and hierarchical connectivity that acts in tandem with pacemaker properties to provide an ignition and gear-shift mechanism to start locomotion and change speed. A comprehensive mapping of synaptic connections reveals three recurrent circuit modules engaged sequentially to increase locomotor speed. The connectivity between V2a interneurons of different modules displayed a clear asymmetry in favor of connections from faster to slower modules. The interplay between V2a interneuron pacemaker properties and their organized connectivity provides a mechanism for locomotor initiation and speed control. Thus, our results provide mechanistic insights into how the spinal CPG transforms descending drive into locomotion and align its speed with the initial intention."

Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is a β-galactoside-binding lectin that is reportedly useful as a biomarker for IFN gene signatures. In a cross-sectional study of Japanese patients with recent-onset SLE, we aimed to determine whether raised serum Gal-9 levels were associated with the disease activity or organ damage seen in SLE patients.The current study included 58 Japanese patients with SLE and 31 age-matched healthy individuals. Disease activity and organ damage were assessed using SLE Disease Activity 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) damage index. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gal-9 concentrations were quantified using ELISA. Correlation analyses between Gal-9 and clinical parameters including disease activity were performed.Serum levels of Gal-9 were significantly increased in patients with SLE compared with the control group (16.6 ng/ml, [interquartile range (IQR); 3.6-59.7] versus 4.74 ng/ml, [IQR; 3.0-9.5], p<0.0001). Gal-9 was significantly correlated with disease activity measures in the SLEDAI-2K. Serum Gal-9 levels were significantly greater in patients with SLE-related organ involvement (23.1 ng/ml, [IQR; 5.1-59.7] versus 12.5ng/ml, [IQR; 3.6-39.0], p = 0.013). Whereas there was no difference in serum levels of CXCL10 or M2BPGi between patients with and without SLE-related organ involvement. Serum levels of Gal-9 were significantly higher in SLE patients with active renal involvement determined by BILAG renal score (A-B) compared to those without active renal involvement (C-E). Whereas there was no significant difference in serum levels of Gal-9 between SLE patients with or without active other organ involvements (neurological or hematological) determined by BILAG score. SLE patients with detectable circulating IFN-α had raised serum Gal-9 levels. Levels of Gal-9 were significantly higher in the CSF from patients with recent-onset neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) than in those from non-SLE controls (3.5 ng/ml, [IQR; 1.0-27.2] versus 1.2 ng/ml, [IQR; 0.9-2.1], p = 0.009).Gal-9 could be a serologic marker of disease activity and organ involvement in SLE patients. Future studies evaluating the role of Gal-9 in the SLE phenotype may provide insights into SLE pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3001292301,"Several hemipteran species feed on the phloem sap of plants and produce large amounts of honeydew that is collected by bees to produce honeydew honey. Therefore, it is important to know whether it is predominantly the hemipteran species or the host plant to influence the honeydew composition. This is particularly relevant for those botanical and zoological species from which the majority of honeydew honey originates. To investigate this issue, honeydew from two Cinara species located on Abies alba as well as from two Cinara and two Physokermes species located on Picea abies were collected. Phloem exudates of the host plants were also analyzed. Honeydew of all species contained different proportions of hexoses, sucrose, melezitose, erlose, and further di- and trisaccharides, whereas the phloem exudates of the host trees contained no trisaccharides. Moreover, the proportions of sugars differed significantly between hemipteran species feeding on the same tree species. Sucrose hydrolysis and oligosaccharide formation was shown in whole-body homogenates of aphids. The type of the produced oligosaccharides in the aphid-extracts correlated with the oligosaccharide composition in the honeydew of the different aphid species. The total contents of amino acids and inorganic ions in the honeydew were much lower than the sugar content. Glutamine and glutamate were predominant amino acids in the honeydew of all six hemipteran species and also in the phloem exudates of both tree species. Potassium was the dominant inorganic ion in all honeydew samples and also in the phloem exudate. Statistical analyses reveal that the sugar composition of honeydew is determined more by the hemipteran species than by the host plant. Consequently, it can be assumed that the sugar composition of honeydew honey is also more influenced by the hemipteran species than by the host tree."

These core NECs serve as a hexameric lattice-structured platform for capsid docking and recruit viral and cellular NEC-associated factors that jointly exert nuclear lamina- and membrane-rearranging functions (multicomponent NEC). Here, we report the X-ray structures of β- and γ-herpesvirus core NECs obtained through an innovative recombinant expression strategy based on NEC-hook::NEC-groove protein fusion constructs. This approach yielded the first structure of γ-herpesviral core NEC, namely the 1.56 Å structure of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BFRF1–BFLF2, as well as an increased resolution 1.48 Å structure of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pUL50-pUL53. Detailed analysis of these structures revealed that the prominent hook segment is absolutely required for core NEC formation and contributes approximately 80% of the interaction surface of the globular domains of NEC proteins. Moreover, using HCMV::EBV hook domain swap constructs, computational prediction of the roles of individual hook residues for binding, and quantitative binding assays with synthetic peptides presenting the HCMV- and EBV-specific NEC hook sequences, we characterized the unique hook-into-groove NEC interaction at various levels. Although the overall physicochemical characteristics of the protein interfaces differ considerably in these β- and γ-herpesvirus NECs, the binding free energy contributions of residues displayed from identical positions are similar. In summary, the results of our study reveal critical details of the molecular mechanism of herpesviral NEC interactions and highlight their potential as an antiviral drug target.

https://openalex.org/W3001192468,"MS-based metabolomics methods are powerful techniques to map the complex and interconnected metabolic pathways of the heart; however, normalization of metabolite abundance to sample input in heart tissues remains a technical challenge. Herein, we describe an improved GC-MS–based metabolomics workflow that uses insoluble protein–derived glutamate for the normalization of metabolites within each sample and includes normalization to protein-derived amino acids to reduce biological variation and detect small metabolic changes. Moreover, glycogen is measured within the metabolomics workflow. We applied this workflow to study heart metabolism by first comparing two different methods of heart removal: the Langendorff heart method (reverse aortic perfusion) and in situ freezing of mouse heart with a modified tissue freeze-clamp approach. We then used the in situ freezing method to study the effects of acute β-adrenergic receptor stimulation (through isoproterenol (ISO) treatment) on heart metabolism. Using our workflow and within minutes, ISO reduced the levels of metabolites involved in glycogen metabolism, glycolysis, and the Krebs cycle, but the levels of pentose phosphate pathway metabolites and of many free amino acids remained unchanged. This observation was coupled to a 6-fold increase in phosphorylated adenosine nucleotide abundance. These results support the notion that ISO acutely accelerates oxidative metabolism of glucose to meet the ATP demand required to support increased heart rate and cardiac output. In summary, our MS-based metabolomics workflow enables improved quantification of cardiac metabolites and may also be compatible with other methods such as LC or capillary electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W3001093896,"The existence of excess zeros in the distribution of antenatal care (ANC) visits in Bangladesh raises the research question of whether there are two separate generating processes in taking ANC and the frequency of ANC. Thus the main objective of this study is to identify a proper count regression model for the number of ANC visits by pregnant women in Bangladesh covering the issues of overdispersion, zero-inflation, and intra-cluster correlation with an additional objective of determining risk factors for ANC use and its frequency. The data have been extracted from the nationally representative 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, where 22% of the total 4493 women did not take any ANC during pregnancy. Since these zero ANC visits can be either structural or sampling zeros, two-part zero-inflated and hurdle regression models are investigated along with the standard one-part count regression models. Correlation among response values has been accounted for by incorporating cluster-specific random effects in the models. The hurdle negative binomial regression model with cluster-specific random intercepts in both the zero and the count part is found to be the best model according to various diagnostic tools including likelihood ratio and uniformity tests. The results show that women who have poor education, live in poor households, have less access to mass media, or belong to the Sylhet and Chittagong regions are less likely to use ANC and also have fewer ANC visits. Additionally, women who live in rural areas, depend on family members' decisions to take health care, and have unintended pregnancies had fewer ANC visits. The findings recommend taking both cluster-specific random effects and overdispersion and zero-inflation into account in modelling the ANC data of Bangladesh. Moreover, safe motherhood programmes still need to pay particular attention to disadvantaged and vulnerable subgroups of women."
https://openalex.org/W3002200859,"The δ isozyme of diacylglycerol kinase (DGKδ) plays critical roles in lipid signaling by converting diacylglycerol (DG) to phosphatidic acid (PA). We previously demonstrated that DGKδ preferably phosphorylates palmitic acid (16:0)- and/or palmitoleic acid (16:1)-containing DG molecular species, but not arachidonic acid (20:4)-containing DG species, which are recognized as DGK substrates derived from phosphatidylinositol turnover, in high glucose-stimulated myoblasts. However, little is known about the origin of these DG molecular species. DGKδ and two DG-generating enzymes, sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) 1 and SMS-related protein (SMSr), contain a sterile α motif domain (SAMD). In this study, we found that SMSr–SAMD, but not SMS1–SAMD, co-immunoprecipitates with DGKδ–SAMD. Full-length DGKδ co-precipitated with full-length SMSr more strongly than with SMS1. However, SAMD-deleted variants of SMSr and DGKδ interacted only weakly with full-length DGKδ and SMSr, respectively. These results strongly suggested that DGKδ interacts with SMSr through their respective SAMDs. To determine the functional outcomes of the relationship between DGKδ and SMSr, we used LC-MS/MS to investigate whether overexpression of DGKδ and/or SMSr in COS-7 cells alters the levels of PA species. We found that SMSr overexpression significantly enhances the production of 16:0- or 16:1-containing PA species such as 14:0/16:0-, 16:0/16:0-, 16:0/18:1-, and/or 16:1/18:1-PA in DGKδ-overexpressing COS-7 cells. Moreover, SMSr enhanced DGKδ activity via their SAMDs in vitro. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that SMSr is a candidate DG-providing enzyme upstream of DGKδ and that the two enzymes represent a new pathway independent of phosphatidylinositol turnover."
https://openalex.org/W3002774159,"Diel vertical migration is a widespread behavioral phenomenon where organisms migrate through the water column and may modify behavior relative to changing environmental conditions based on physiological tolerances. Here, we combined a novel suite of biologging technologies to examine the thermal physiology (intramuscular temperature), fine-scale swimming behavior and activity (overall dynamic body acceleration as a proxy for energy expenditure) of bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus) in response to environmental changes (depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen) experienced during diel vertical migrations. In the subtropical waters off Hawai‘i, sixgill sharks undertook pronounced diel vertical migrations and spent considerable amounts of time in cold (5–7°C), low oxygen conditions (10–25% saturation) during their deeper daytime distribution. Further, sixgill sharks spent the majority of their deeper daytime distribution with intramuscular temperatures warmer than ambient water temperatures, thereby providing them with a significant thermal advantage over non-vertically migrating and smaller-sized prey. Sixgill sharks exhibited relatively high rates of activity during both shallow (night) and deep (day) phases and contrary to our predictions, did not reduce activity levels during their deeper daytime distribution while experiencing low temperature and dissolved oxygen levels. This demonstrates an ability to tolerate the low oxygen conditions occurring within the local oxygen minimum zone. The novel combination of biologging technologies used here enabled innovative in situ deep-sea natural experiments and provided significant insight into the behavioral and physiological ecology of an ecologically important deepwater species."
https://openalex.org/W3001011274,"Understanding the mechanisms by which viruses evade host cell immune defenses is important for developing improved antiviral therapies. In an unusual twist, human cytomegalovirus co-opts the antiviral radical SAM enzyme viperin (virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum–associated, interferon-inducible) to enhance viral infectivity. This process involves translocation of viperin to the mitochondrion, where it binds the β-subunit (HADHB) of the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme complex that catalyzes thiolysis of β-ketoacyl–CoA esters as part of fatty acid β-oxidation. Here we investigated how the interaction between these two enzymes alters their activities and affects cellular ATP levels. Experiments with purified enzymes indicated that viperin inhibits the thiolase activity of HADHB, but, unexpectedly, HADHB activates viperin, leading to synthesis of the antiviral nucleotide 3′-deoxy-3′,4′-didehydro-CTP. Measurements of enzyme activities in lysates prepared from transfected HEK293T cells expressing these enzymes mirrored the findings obtained with purified enzymes. Thus, localizing viperin to mitochondria decreased thiolase activity, and coexpression of HADHB significantly increased viperin activity. Furthermore, targeting viperin to mitochondria also increased the rate at which HADHB is retrotranslocated out of mitochondria and degraded, providing an additional mechanism by which viperin reduces HADHB activity. Targeting viperin to mitochondria decreased cellular ATP levels by more than 50%, consistent with the enzyme disrupting fatty acid catabolism. These results provide biochemical insight into the mechanism by which human cytomegalovirus subverts viperin; they also provide a biochemical rationale for viperin's recently discovered role in regulating thermogenesis in adipose tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3002342632,"Background A total of 3,419 new HIV diagnoses were reported in Germany in 2016, with migrants from sub-Saharan Africa (misSA) accounting for 14.1%. To understand the driving factors behind the epidemiological situation, we conducted a quantitative cross-sectional survey on knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and practices regarding HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among misSA living in six German cities utilizing participatory health research. Methods Participants were recruited by peer researchers. Levels of knowledge, information needs, and preferred methods of information dissemination were analyzed to inform future prevention planning. Additionally, we analyzed sexual behavior and other risk factors for contracting HIV and STIs. The results may facilitate the formulation of targeted prevention messages in the future. Results We included 2,432 participants in the analysis. General knowledge about HIV was adequate, as 86.9% were aware of the presented information. Statements about HIV co-infections were prior knowledge for 53.4% of the participants and about German HIV policies and HIV testing for 54.7%. Knowledge about other STIs differed, ranging from 69.6% who have ever heard of gonorrhea to 23.8% who have ever heard of genital warts. Groups with particular knowledge gaps were i) younger misSA, ii) recent migrants, iii) misSA without regular access to the German health care system, iv) misSA of lower socioeconomic status, and v) misSA with Muslim religious affiliation. The majority of participants reported information needs (72.8%), and 71.3% wanted to obtain this information from health professionals. Male misSA were more likely to report five or more sexual partners compared to females. Less than half of participants reported always using condoms with non-steady sexual partners (46.8%). Reasons for not using condoms differed between males and females. A considerable proportion of females (16.3%) and males (6.8%) experienced sexualized violence. More than one fourth of women (26.9%) were affected by female genital mutilation/cutting. Discussion Future prevention planning should focus on sub-groups with particular knowledge gaps, recognizing their preferred methods of information dissemination. Prevention messages for male misSA should focus on their own risk perception and for female misSA on empowerment, e.g. to negotiate condom use."
https://openalex.org/W3003492219,"The lateral hypothalamus (LH) includes several anatomical subregions involved in eating and reward motivation. This study explored localization of function across different LH subregions in controlling food intake stimulated by optogenetic channelrhodopsin excitation, and in supporting laser self-stimulation. We particularly compared the tuberal LH subregion, the posterior LH subregion, and the lateral preoptic area. Local diameters of tissue optogenetically stimulated within the LH were assessed by measuring laser-induced Fos plumes and Jun plumes via immunofluorescence surrounding optic fiber tips. Those plume diameters were used to map localization of function for behavioral effects elicited by LH optogenetic stimulation. Optogenetic stimulation of the tuberal subsection of the LH produced the most robust eating behavior and food intake initially, but produced only mild laser self-stimulation in the same rats. However, after repeated exposures to optogenetic stimulation, tuberal LH behavioral profiles shifted toward more self-stimulation and less food intake. By contrast, stimulation of the lateral preoptic area produced relatively little food intake or self-stimulation, either initially or after extended stimulation experience. Stimulation in the posterior LH subregion supported moderate self-stimulation, but not food intake, and at higher laser intensity shifted valence to evoke escape behaviors. We conclude that the tuberal LH subregion may best mediate stimulation-bound increases in food intake stimulated by optogenetic excitation. However, incentive motivational effects of tuberal LH stimulation may shift toward self-stimulation behavior after repeated stimulation. By contrast, the lateral preoptic area and posterior LH do not as readily elicit either eating behavior or laser self-stimulation, and may be more prone to higher-intensity aversive effects."
https://openalex.org/W3001546530,"Warsaw grouper, Hyporthodus nigritus, is a western Atlantic Ocean species typically found at depths between 55 and 525 m. It is listed as a species of concern by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service and as near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. However, little information exists on the species’ life history in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) and its stock status in that region is currently unknown. Age of nGOM Warsaw grouper was investigated via opaque zone counts in otolith thin sections (max age = 61 y), and then the bomb 14C chronometer was employed to validate the accuracy of age estimates. Otolith cores (n = 14) were analyzed with accelerator mass spectrometry and resulting Δ14C values overlain on a loess regression computed for a regional coral and known-age red snapper Δ14C time series. Residual analysis between predicted Δ14C values from the loess regression versus Warsaw grouper otolith core Δ14C values indicated no significant difference in the two data series. Therefore, the accuracy of otolith-based aging was validated, which enabled growth and longevity estimates to be made for nGOM Warsaw grouper. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) Δ14C values collected from the nGOM support the inference that juvenile Warsaw grouper occur in shelf waters (<200 m) since DIC Δ14C values in this depth range are enriched in 14C and similar to the Δ14C values from otolith cores. A Bayesian model was fit to fishery-dependent age composition data and produced von Bertalanffy growth function parameters of L∞ = 1,533 mm, k = 0.14 y-1, and t0 = 1.82 y. Fishing mortality also was estimated in the model, which resulted in a ratio of fishing to natural mortality of 5.1:1. Overall, study results indicate Warsaw grouper is a long-lived species that is estimated to have experienced significant overfishing in the nGOM, with the age of most landed fish being <10 y."
https://openalex.org/W3003250855,"The widespread presence of overweight and obesity increases with every decade, and the number of people with body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2 has doubled in the last 30 years. The aim of the study is to assess the correlation between MRI-evaluated ectopic fat accumulation in pancreas, skeletal muscles and liver and the incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, depending on BMI and waist circumference ratio. This prospective study included 267 consecutive patients who were referred to abdominal MRI and underwent a standard clinical assessment with BMI and waist circumference ratio calculation. Ectopic fat accumulation in pancreas, skeletal muscles and liver was evaluated in magnetic resonance imaging using the fat-water separated Dixon imaging. There were statistically significant differences in mean steatosis of all assessed organs in the group of patients with type 2 diabetes or hypertension in comparison to the non-diabetic group as well as to the group without hypertension. It has been observed that pancreas and skeletal muscles are more susceptible to fat accumulation than liver. According to our results, there is a relation between the fat content in muscles, pancreas and liver, the incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and also body mass index and waist circumference ratio. We believe that future studies should aim to determine whether the use of fat content measurement in certain organs could be used as a biomarker that can enable early detection of reversible metabolic changes, as well as their subsequent monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3001755538,"The analysis of census data aggregated by administrative units introduces a statistical bias known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). Previous researches have mostly assessed the effect of MAUP on upscaling models. The present study contributes to clarify the effects of MAUP on the downscaling methodologies, highlighting how a priori choices of scales and shapes could influence the results. We aggregated chicken and duck fine-resolution census in Thailand, using three administrative census levels in regular and irregular shapes. We then disaggregated the data within the Gridded Livestock of the World analytical framework, sampling predictors in two different ways. A sensitivity analysis on Pearson’s r correlation statistics and RMSE was carried out to understand how size and shapes of the response variables affect the goodness-of-fit and downscaling performances. We showed that scale, rather than shapes and sampling methods, affected downscaling precision, suggesting that training the model using the finest administrative level available is preferable. Moreover, datasets showing non-homogeneous distribution but instead spatial clustering seemed less affected by MAUP, yielding higher Pearson’s r values and lower RMSE compared to a more spatially homogenous dataset. Implementing aggregation sensitivity analysis in spatial studies could help to interpret complex results and disseminate robust products."
https://openalex.org/W3001197855,"Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat a variety of solid human tumors, including localized prostate cancer. However, treatment failure often ensues due to tumor intrinsic or acquired radioresistance. Here we find that the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway is associated with resistance to genotoxic stress in aggressive prostate cancer cells. MEK5 knockdown by RNA interference sensitizes prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and etoposide treatment, as assessed by clonogenic survival and short-term proliferation assays. Mechanistically, MEK5 downregulation impairs phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK at serine 2056 in response to IR or etoposide treatment. Although MEK5 knockdown does not influence the initial appearance of radiation- and etoposide-induced γH2AX and 53BP1 foci, it markedly delays their resolution, indicating a DNA repair defect. A cell-based assay shows that nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is compromised in cells with ablated MEK5 protein expression. Finally, MEK5 silencing combined with focal irradiation causes strong inhibition of tumor growth in mouse xenografts, compared with MEK5 depletion or radiation alone. These findings reveal a convergence between MEK5 signaling and DNA repair by NHEJ in conferring resistance to genotoxic stress in advanced prostate cancer and suggest targeting MEK5 as an effective therapeutic intervention in the management of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3001707288,"Monitoring trends in the extinction risk of species is important for tracking conservation effectiveness. The Red List index (RLI) reflects changes in aggregate extinction risk for sets of species over time (a value of zero means that all species are extinct, a value of one means that all species are categorized as Least Concern). We calculated the first national RLI for birds in Colombia for the period 2002–2016, and disaggregated indices by ecosystems, regions, and species groups. Overall, the status of birds in Colombia has moderately deteriorated during 2002–2016, declining by 0.0000714% per year (the global RLI for birds declined by 0.0297% per year). High Andean forest, paramo, and freshwater are the ecosystems in worst condition. The two regions with the greatest avian diversity contrasted: the Andes has the lowest RLI, and the Amazon the highest. Among species groups, gamebirds, parrots, large frugivores, and forest raptors are the most threatened. Habitat loss from expansion of illicit crops and population declines from hunting were the most important threats. Agricultural expansion, invasive alien animal species, illegal logging and illegal mining are significant threats for some species. Tracking species’ extinction risk is important in a country with the highest bird species richness in the world, dynamic spatial patterns of habitat loss, and high levels of endemism. Recent developments provide reasons for both hope and despair. In 2016, a peace agreement ended 50 years of armed conflict. New opportunities for biodiversity conservation, local development based on bird-watching tourism, and advancement in scientific knowledge of birds now occur alongside dramatic increases in deforestation. These new conservation opportunities and challenges provide strong motivation to take advantage of the fact that the overall risk of extinction of birds in Colombia is still relatively low and stable. Effective action is urgently needed while there still is the opportunity to prevent extinctions and safeguard species, particularly those in higher risk categories."
https://openalex.org/W3003468272,"This study aimed to identify trajectories of alcohol use (AU) and their associations with the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) among young men with different weekly drinking patterns.A longitudinal latent class analysis integrating several aspects of AU, such as drinking quantity and frequency on weekends vs workweek days, involving 4719 young Swiss men at ages 20, 21, and 25, and collected by the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors, was used to identify different AU trajectories over time. The development of AUD scores in these trajectories was investigated using generalized linear mixed models.Six AU trajectory classes, similar to those described in the literature, were identified: 'abstainers-light drinkers', 'light workweek increasers', 'light decreasers', 'moderate weekend decreasers', 'moderate workweek increasers', and 'heavy drinkers'. Only 12% of participants were assigned to a trajectory class with decreasing AU associated with a decline in their AUD score. AUD scores increased in trajectory classes exhibiting increasing AU on workweek days, despite low and moderate general AU. Finally, more than 59% of participants were on an AU trajectory presenting no change in their mean AUD score over time.Maturing out of problematic AU in emerging adulthood is not the norm in Switzerland, and the AUD score developed in late adolescence remains until at least emerging adulthood. AU on workweek days is a more practical marker of potentially problematic AU. This calls for timely interventions in adolescence and concerning regular drinking on workweek days in emerging adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W3004373201,"In recent years, consistent individual differences in behavior, or personalities, have been a topic of increasing interest as researchers strive to understand and predict the responses of individuals and populations to anthropogenic changes. Behavioral studies in wild populations often require that animals are live trapped before behavioral observation can occur, and this is especially true in studies investigating animal personalities. However, it is unknown whether the amount of time confined to a live trap may regulate the behavior of trapped individuals. Specifically, if the duration of trap confinement directly influences behavior, then by obtaining wild animals through live trapping we may be confounding the very measurements of greatest interest. To investigate whether the duration of trap confinement influences the behavior of trapped individuals, we performed a study on two small mammal species, focusing specifically on personality traits. We positioned high-definition trail cameras facing Longworth small mammal traps in the field to observe capture events and record the time of capture. We then measured personality in captured deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) using three standardized tests, and through linear and generalized linear models we found that the time an animal had spent confined to a trap before testing did not affect 86% of behaviors exhibited. Our results showed two weak behavioral effects of confinement duration on boldness and docility resulting from an interaction between the duration of confinement and whether or not an individual was naïve to trapping. Our results suggest that behavioral measurements of wild, trapped small mammals are not determined by the time spent confined to a trap. However, researchers should use caution and consider whether an animal is naïve to trapping during analysis since habituation to the live trap may play a role in the effects of confinement duration on behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3001182208,"Convergence insufficiency (CI) is a dysfunction of binocular vision that is associated with various signs and symptoms in near work. However, CI screening is performed less frequently in adults than in children. We aimed to evaluate the ability of screening tests to discriminate CI from other binocular vision anomalies and normal binocular vision in young adults. One hundred eighty-four university students (age, 18-28 years) who underwent an eye examination due to ocular discomfort were included. Near point of convergence (NPC), phoria, accommodative amplitude, fusional vergence, the ratio of accommodative convergence to accommodation, relative accommodation, binocular accommodative facility, vergence facility, and the values corresponding to Sheard's and Percival's criteria were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for each test was also performed. The prevalence of CI ranged from 10.3% to 21.2%, depending on the signs and the presence of CI associated with accommodative disorders. Assessments based on NPC, Sheard's criterion, and Percival's criterion showed high discriminative ability, with the ability being higher between the CI and normal binocular vision groups than between the CI and non-CI groups. Sheard's criterion showed the highest diagnostic performance in discriminating CI with three signs from the non-CI group. The cut-off values were 7.2 cm for NPC, -0.23 to 1.00 for Sheard's criterion, and -4.00 to -2.33 for Percival's criterion. Our results suggest that the use of Sheard's criterion with NPC shows high performance for screening of CI."
https://openalex.org/W3004132449,"The Alda score is commonly used to quantify lithium responsiveness in bipolar disorder. Most often, this score is dichotomized into “responder” and “non-responder” categories, respectively. This practice is often criticized as inappropriate, since continuous variables are thought to invariably be “more informative” than their dichotomizations. We therefore investigated the degree of informativeness across raw and dichotomized versions of the Alda score, using data from a published study of the scale’s inter-rater reliability (n = 59 raters of 12 standardized vignettes each). After learning a generative model for the relationship between observed and ground truth scores (the latter defined by a consensus rating of the 12 vignettes), we show that the dichotomized scale is more robust to inter-rater disagreement than the raw 0-10 scale. Further theoretical analysis shows that when a measure’s reliability is stronger at one extreme of the continuum—a scenario which has received little-to-no statistical attention, but which likely occurs for the Alda score ≥ 7—dichotomization of a continuous variable may be more informative concerning its ground truth value, particularly in the presence of noise. Our study suggests that research employing the Alda score of lithium responsiveness should continue using the dichotomous definition, particularly when data are sampled across multiple raters."
https://openalex.org/W3004299058,"Significance This is the first study to validate the repeatability of objective measurements of amplitude of accommodation (AA) using the TONOREF III (NIDEK Co., Ltd., Japan), which can measure the AA in 30 seconds. Purpose To evaluate the repeatability of objective measurements of AA using the TONOREF III and explored the association between objectively measured AA and factors, including age, sex, spherical equivalent, baseline pupil size and pupil size change during accommodation. Methods This cross-sectional study recruited 35 healthy subjects aged 26 to 52 years. The Bland-Altman method and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the repeatability of TONOREF III measurements. The relationships between AA and age, sex, baseline pupil size, changes in pupil size (ΔPS) during accommodation were analyzed using linear regression for univariate and multivariate analysis. Results The mean difference in AA (ΔAA) between two sessions of TONOREF III measurements was 0.23 D (95% CI: -1.07 to +1.53 D), while no significant correlation was found between the mean and ΔAA (p = .14). The ICCs of the TONOREF III was 0.96. Age, sex, and ΔPS during accommodation were significant factors affecting the AA in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The repeatability of objective AA measurements using the TONOREF III was good. Measuring AA using the TONOREFTM III in clinical practice is feasible."
https://openalex.org/W3003111833,"In acute care medicine, knowledge of the underlying (patho)-physiology is of paramount importance. This may be especially relevant in intensive care medicine, where individual competence and proficiency greatly depend on knowledge and understanding of critical care physiology. In settings with time constraints such as intensive care units (ICUs), time allotted to education is often limited. We evaluated whether introduction of a short, interactive, peer-led flipped classroom session is feasible and can provide ICU residents with a better understanding of critical care physiology.Using the flipped classroom concept, we developed a 15-minute peer-led interactive ""physiology education"" session to introduce a total of 44 residents to critical care physiology. Using a nine-item electronic survey with open questions and a five-point Likert scale, we analysed the overall concept with regard to feasibility, motivation, and subjective learning of critical care physiology.The overall rate of response to the survey was 70.5% (31/44). The residents reported that these sessions sparked their interest (p = 0.005, Chi square 10.52), and that discussion and interaction during these sessions had promoted their knowledge and understanding. Both novice and experienced residents reported that new knowledge was imparted (both p<0.0001, Chi-square 32.97 and 25.04, respectively).In an environment with time constraints such as the ICU, a 15-minute, interactive, peer-led flipped classroom teaching session was considered feasible and generally appeared useful for teaching critical care physiology to ICU residents. Responses to questions on questionnaires indicated that teaching sessions sparked interest and increased motivation. This approach may theoretically induce a modification in professional behaviour and promote self-directed learning. We therefore support the use of peer-led flipped classroom training sessions in the ICU. Whether these sessions result in improved ICU care should be addressed in subsequent studies."
https://openalex.org/W3001691593,"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by pulmonary epithelial and endothelial barrier dysfunction and injury. In severe forms of ARDS, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is often the last option for life support. Endothelial progenitor (EPC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can regenerate damaged endothelium and thereby improve pulmonary endothelial dysfunction. However, we still lack sufficient knowledge about how ECMO might affect EPC- and MSC-mediated regenerative pathways in ARDS. Therefore, we investigated if ECMO impacts EPC and MSC numbers in ARDS patients.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ARDS patients undergoing ECMO (n = 16) and without ECMO support (n = 12) and from healthy volunteers (n = 16) were isolated. The number and presence of circulating EPC and MSC was detected by flow cytometry. Serum concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) were determined.In the ECMO group, MSC subpopulations were higher by 71% compared to the non-ECMO group. Numbers of circulating EPC were not significantly altered. During ECMO, VEGF and Ang2 serum levels remained unchanged compared to the non-ECMO group (p = 0.16), but Ang2 serum levels in non-survivors of ARDS were significantly increased by 100% (p = 0.02) compared to survivors.ECMO support in ARDS is specifically associated with an increased number of circulating MSC, most likely due to enhanced mobilization, but not with a higher numbers of EPC or serum concentrations of VEGF and Ang2."

Experiments 1 and 2 provide evidence that children use a person’s history of calibration to guide their learning. Experiments 2 and 3 revealed a developmental progression in calibration understanding: Children preferred a well-calibrated over a miscalibrated confident person by around 4 years, whereas even 7- to 8-year-olds were insensitive to calibration in hesitant people.

https://openalex.org/W3003197406,"The common long-armed octopus, Octopus minor, is an important component of systems and supports the local fisheries in the coastal areas of northern China. For the fishery management and artificial breeding, especially for the management of exclusive conservation reserves, its role in the ecosystem requires assessment. Therefore, the feeding intensity of O. minor was studied from April to July 2014 when females reaching ovary maturation, and prey composition was identified from stomach contents using a DNA barcoding method. Of the 172 sampled octopuses, 66 had stomach contents that were nearly digested into pulp. On the whole, the feeding intensity of octopus remained more or less the same during the first three months and significantly decreased in July. The changes of feeding intensity were different between females and males; in females, the intensity of feeding decreased from April to July; in case of males, however, the feeding activity increased from April to June and decreased thereafter. The feeding intensity of the females was extremely greater than that of the males. O. minor was a generalist predator and based on homology searches and phylogenetic analysis, a total of 10 different taxa were identified in the stomach contents. In terms of percent composition by frequency of occurrences (%N), fishes accounted for the most of the octopuses diet (50%), followed by cephalopod (25%), crustaceans (21.7%), annelid (1.7%) and nematode (1.7%). The families of Gobiidae and Octopodidae appeared in all months and Protunidae appeared in three months. The results confirmed that Gobiidae family (45.8%, by frequency of occurrences) was an important source of food during the time when females reaching ovarian maturation. From April to July, the observed cannibalism showed an increasing trend. Controlling and reducing fishing production of Gobiidae fishes in conservation area are recommended from April to June when female octopuses are actively feeding."
https://openalex.org/W3003067233,"Background Invoices had been used in food product traceability, however, none have addressed the automated alarm system for food safety by utilizing electronic invoice big data. In this paper, we present an alarm system for edible oil manufacture that can prevent a food safety crisis rather than trace problematic sources post-crisis. Materials and methods Using nearly 100 million labeled e-invoices from the 2013‒2014 of 595 edible oil manufacturers provided by Ministry of Finance, we applied text-mining, statistical and machine learning techniques to “train” the system for two functions: (1) to sieve edible oil-related e-invoices of manufacturers who may also produce other merchandise and (2) to identify suspicious edible oil manufacture based on irrational transactions from the e-invoices sieved. Results The system was able to (1) accurately sieve the correct invoices with sensitivity >95% and specificity >98% via text classification and (2) identify problematic manufacturers with 100% accuracy via Random Forest machine learning method, as well as with sensitivity >70% and specificity >99% through simple decision-tree method. Conclusion E-invoice has bright future on the application of food safety. It can not only be used for product traceability, but also prevention of adverse events by flag suspicious manufacturers. Compulsory usage of e-invoice for food producing can increase the accuracy of this alarm system."
https://openalex.org/W2999241620,"Introduction Junior residents routinely prescribe medications for hospitalised patients with only arms-length supervision, which compromises patient safety. A cardinal example is insulin prescribing, which is commonplace, routinely delegated to very junior doctors, difficult, potentially very dangerous, and getting no better. Our aim was to operationalise the concept of ‘readiness to prescribe’ by validating an instrument to quality-improve residents’ workplace prescribing education. Methods Guided by theories of behaviour change, implementation, and error, and by empirical evidence, we developed and refined a mixed-methods 24-item evaluation instrument, and analysed numerical responses from Foundation Trainees (junior residents) in Northern Ireland, UK using principal axis factoring, and conducted a framework analysis of participants’ free-text responses. Results 255 trainees participated, 54% women and 46% men, 80% of whom were in the second foundation year. The analysis converged on a 4-factor solution explaining 57% of the variance. Participants rated their capability to prescribe higher (79%) than their capability to learn to prescribe (69%; p<0.001) and rated the support to their prescribing education lower still (43%; p<0.001). The findings were similar in men and women, first and second year trainees, and in different hospitals. Free text responses described an unreflective type of learning from experience in which participants tended to 'get by' when faced with complex problems. Discussion Operationalising readiness to prescribe as a duality, comprising residents’ capability and the fitness of their educational environments, demonstrated room for improvement in both. We offer the instrument to help clinical educators improve the two in tandem."
https://openalex.org/W3000259278,"Since 1984, nearly 1,000 people have been killed in the Brazilian Amazon due to land conflicts stemming from unequal distribution of land, land tenure insecurity, and lawlessness. During this same period, the region experienced almost complete deforestation (< 8% forest cover by 2010). Land conflict exacts a human toll, but it also affects agents’ decisions about land use, the subject of this article. Using a property-level panel dataset covering the period of redemocratization in Brazil (1984) until the privatization of long-term leases in the Eastern Amazon (2010), we show that deforestation is affected by land conflict, particularly in cases of expropriation of property for agrarian reform settlement formation and when that conflict involves fatalities. Deforestation on agrarian reform settlements is much greater when soils are poor for agriculture and when the land has been the object of past conflict. Deforestation and conflict are episodic, and both agronomic drivers and contentious drivers of land change are active in the region. Ultimately, the outcome of these processes of contentious and agronomic land change is substantial deforestation, regardless of who was in possession and control of the land."
https://openalex.org/W3001207523,"Background Locomotion is an energy costly behaviour, particularly when it entails raising weight against gravity. Minimization of locomotor costs appears a universal default. Avoidance of stair climbing helps humans minimise their energetic costs. In public access settings, demographic subgroups that raise more ‘dead’ weight than their comparison groups when climbing are more likely to avoid stairs by choosing the escalator. Individuals who minimise stair costs at work, however, can accumulate a deficit in energy expenditure in daily life with potential implications for weight gain. This paper tests the generality of avoidance of stairs in pedestrians encumbered by additional weight in three studies. Methods Pedestrian choices for stairs or the alternative were audited by trained observers who coded weight status, presence of large bags and sex for each pedestrian. Sex-specific silhouettes for BMIs of 25 facilitated coding of weight status. Choices between stairs and a lift to ascend and descend were coded in seven buildings (n = 26,981) and at an outdoor city centre site with the same alternatives (n = 7,433). A further study audited choices to ascend when the alternative to stairs was a sloped ramp in two locations (n = 16,297). Analyses employed bootstrapped logistic regression (1000 samples). Results At work and the city centre site, the overweight, those carrying a large bag and females avoided both stair climbing and descent more frequently than their comparison groups. The final study revealed greater avoidance of stairs in these demographic subgroups when the alternative means of ascent was a sloped ramp. Discussion Minimization of the physiological costs of transport-related walking biases behaviour towards avoidance of stair usage when an alternative is available.

https://openalex.org/W3001330686,"Current and potential medical therapy for obstruction‐induced myopathic bladder dysfunction (from benign prostatic hyperplasia or posterior urethral valves) focuses on symptoms. The persistent tissue pathology and dysfunction after release of obstruction is often deemed irreversible without any systematic therapeutic approaches. As rapamycin can attenuate bladder smooth muscle hypertrophy and dysfunction during the genesis of partial obstruction in vivo, we tested whether rapamycin could improve persistent function after release of obstruction (de‐obstruction or REL). Female Sprague‐Dawley rat bladders were partially obstructed (PBO) by suturing around both the urethra and a para‐urethral steel rod, then removing the rod. One day prior to release of obstruction (preREL), voiding parameters and residual urine volume of preREL+future rapa, preREL+future veh groups were recorded. Release of obstruction (REL) was performed by suture removal following 6 weeks of PBO. For 4 more weeks after the de‐obstruction, REL animals were randomized to rapamycin (REL+rapa) or vehicle (REL+veh). PBO for 6 weeks were used as positive controls. In shams, the urethra was exposed, but no suture tied. Voiding parameters and residual urine volume were measured prior to sacrifice of sham and REL+veh or REL+rapa, and PBO. Rapamycin efficacy was tested by pair‐wise comparison of changes in individual voiding data from preREL+future veh or preREL+future rapa versus REL+veh or REL+rapa, respectively, as well as by comparisons of REL+veh to REL+rapa groups. Bladders were weighed and processed for a high‐throughput QPCR array, and histopathology. Bladder/body mass ratios with PBO increased significantly and remained higher in the release phase in REL+veh animals. REL+rapa versus REL+veh improved residual volumes and micturition fractions toward sham levels. Three genes encoding extracellular proteins, BMP2, SOD3, and IGFBP7, correlated with functional improvement by Pearson's correlations. The promoters of these genes showed enrichment for several motifs including circadian E‐boxes. While obstruction and REL augmented CLOCK and NPAS2 expression above sham levels, rapamycin treatment during release significantly blocked their expression. This experimental design of pharmaco‐intervention during the de‐obstruction phase revealed a novel pathway dysregulated during the clinically relevant treatment phase of obstructive bladder myopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3003239114,"Inhibition of the synthesis of an essential ribosomal protein (r-protein) abrogates the assembly of its cognate subunit, while assembly of the other subunit continues. Ribosomal components that are not stably incorporated into ribosomal particles due to the disrupted assembly are rapidly degraded. The 60S protein uL18/L5 is an exception and this protein accumulates extra-ribosomally during inhibition of 60S assembly. Since the r-proteins in each ribosomal subunit are essential only for the formation of their cognate subunit, it would be predicted that accumulation of extra-ribosomal uL18/L5 is specific to restriction of 60S assembly and does not occur abolition of 40S assembly. Contrary to this prediction, we report here that repression of 40S r-protein genes does lead to accumulation of uL18/L5 outside of the ribosome. Furthermore, the effect varies depending on which 40S ribosomal protein is repressed. Our results also show extra-ribosomal uL18/L5 is formed during 60S assembly, not during degradation of mature cytoplasmic 60S subunits. Finally, we propose a model for the accumulation of extra-ribosomal uL18 in response to the abolition of 40S r-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3003753866,"Soaking hay fodder to reduce dust and soluble carbohydrate (WSC) contents prior to feeding is common practice among horse owners. Soaking can increase bacteria load in hay but no information exists on how this process alters the bacteria profile, which could pose a health risk or digestive challenge, to horses by introducing foreign bacteria into the gastrointestinal tract and so altering the normal profile. The current objectives were to map the bacterial profile of 3 different hays and determine how soaking alters this with the aim of improving best practice when feeding stabled horses. A Perennial Rye grass hay and two meadow s hays were soaked for 0, 1.5, 9 or 16 hours. Pre and post treatment, hays were analysed for WSC and total aerobic bacteria (CFU/g), and differences in bacteria family profiles were determined using ANOVA with significance set at P<0.05. Bacteria were identified via genomic DNA extraction and 16S library preparation (V3 and V4 variable region of 16S rRNA) according to the Illumina protocol. Differences in family operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between individual dry hays and different soaking times were identified via paired t-tests on the DESeq2 normalised data and false discovery rates accounted for using Padj (P<0.05). Mean % WSC losses and actual g/kg lost on DM basis (+/- SE) increased with soaking time being 18% = 30 (10.7), 38% = 72 (43.7), and 42% = 80 (38.8) for 1.5, 9 and 16 hours soak respectively. No relationship existed between WSC leaching and bacteria growth or profile. Grass type influenced bacterial profiles and their responses to soaking, but no differences were seen in richness or Shannon diversity indices. PCA analyses showed clustering of bacteria between meadow hays which differed from the perennial rye grass hay and this difference increased post soaking. Soaking hay pre-feeding causes inconsistent WSC leaching, bacteria growth and alterations in bacterial profiles which are unpredictable but may decrease the hygienic quality of the fodder."
https://openalex.org/W3001512644,"This study aims to analyze the thermal biology and climatic vulnerability of two closely related lizard species (Stenocercus festae and S. guentheri) inhabiting the Ecuadorian Andes at high altitudes. Four physiological parameters-body temperature (Tb), preferred temperature (Tpref), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and critical thermal minimum (CTmin)-were evaluated to analyze the variation of thermophysiological traits among these populations that inhabit different environmental and altitudinal conditions. We also evaluate the availability of operative temperatures, warming tolerance, and thermal safety margin of each population to estimate their possible risks in the face of future raising temperatures. Similar to previous studies, our results suggest that some physiological traits (CTmax and Tb) are influenced by environmental heterogeneity, which brings changes on the thermoregulatory behavior. Other parameters (Tpref and CTmin), may be also influenced by phylogenetic constraints. Moreover, the fluctuating air temperature (Tair) as well as the operative temperatures (Te) showed that these lizards exploit a variety of thermal microenvironments, which may facilitate behavioral thermoregulation. Warming tolerance and thermal safety margin analyses suggest that both species find thermal refugia and remain active without reducing their performance or undergoing thermal stress within their habitats. We suggest that studies on the thermal biology of tropical Andean lizards living at high altitudes are extremely important as these environments exhibit a unique diversity of microclimates, which consequently result on particular thermophysiological adaptations."
https://openalex.org/W3002335812,"Comparative network analysis provides effective computational means for gaining novel insights into the structural and functional compositions of biological networks. In recent years, various methods have been developed for biological network alignment, whose main goal is to identify important similarities and critical differences between networks in terms of their topology and composition. A major impediment to advancing network alignment techniques has been the lack of gold-standard benchmarks that can be used for accurate and comprehensive performance assessment of such algorithms. The original NAPAbench (network alignment performance assessment benchmark) was developed to address this problem, and it has been widely utilized by many researchers for the development, evaluation, and comparison of novel network alignment techniques. In this work, we introduce NAPAbench 2—a major update of the original NAPAbench that was introduced in 2012. NAPAbench 2 includes a completely redesigned network synthesis algorithm that can generate protein-protein interaction (PPI) network families whose characteristics closely match those of the latest real PPI networks. Furthermore, the network synthesis algorithm comes with an intuitive GUI that allows users to easily generate PPI network families with an arbitrary number of networks of any size, according to a flexible user-defined phylogeny. In addition, NAPAbench 2 provides updated benchmark datasets—created using the redesigned network synthesis algorithm—which can be used for comprehensive performance assessment of network alignment algorithms and their scalability."
https://openalex.org/W3002515667,"Despite the scientific consensus on the efficacy of psychotherapy for the treatment of psychological disorders, the evidence of treatment-related changes towards normalization of abnormal brain functions in patients is mixed. In the present experiment, we investigated whether treatment can affect early information processing, by testing abnormal event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by internal and external signals in panic disorder. Sixteen patients with panic disorder and comorbid personality disorder and sixteen control participants performed a response-choice task and a passive viewing task in two testing sessions, separated by around 14 months. During this period, patients received psychological treatment. In agreement with previous studies of performance monitoring, the abnormal amplitude of the Ne/ERN-an index of error processing based on internal signals-did not change between the first and second testing session. However, treatment-related changes were evident for the abnormal vertex positive potential (VPP) evoked by external signals in the response-choice task and the passive viewing task. In patients, the VPP was smaller in the second session compared to the first session, whereas no significant changes occurred in controls. This result supplies evidence of treatment-related changes towards normalization in the early information processing of external visual stimuli in panic disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3003208452,"Background Computed tomography (CT) images of livers may show a hypo-attenuated structure alongside the falciform ligament, which can be a focal fatty pseudolesion and can mimic a malignancy. The preferred location is on the right parafissural site, ventral in segment IVa/b. The etiology is not clear, nor is it known how the histology of this location develops. These are evaluated in this study. Methods 40 adult cadavers with autopsy and / or postmortem CT in a university hospital and a forensic center were included. Liver biopsies were taken at the left side of the falciform ligament as control, and at the right side as the possible precursor of a pseudolesion; these were examined for collagen and fat content. Cadavers with steatotic (>5% fat) or fibrotic (>2% collagen) control samples were excluded. Results Significantly more collagen was present in the right parafissural liver parenchyma: median 0.68% (IQR: 0.32–1.17%), compared to the left side 0.48% (IQR: 0.21–0.75%) (p 0.008), with equal fat content and CT attenuation values. The etiophysiology goes back to the demise of the umbilical venes in the early embryonic and neonatal period. Conclusions The right parafissural area contains more collagen and an equal amount of fat compared to the control left side. This supports the hypothesis of delayed, ‘third’ inflow: the postnatal change in blood supply from umbilical to portal leaves the downstream parafissural area hypoperfused leading to hypoxia which in turn results in collagen accumulation and the persistence of paraumbilical veins of Sappey."
