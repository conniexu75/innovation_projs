https://openalex.org/W2062682951,"Huntington's disease (HD) is one of an increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion. Mice have been generated that are transgenic for the 5' end of the human HD gene carrying (CAG)115-(CAG)150 repeat expansions. In three lines, the transgene is ubiquitously expressed at both mRNA and protein level. Transgenic mice exhibit a progressive neurological phenotype that exhibits many of the features of HD, including choreiform-like movements, involuntary stereotypic movements, tremor, and epileptic seizures, as well as nonmovement disorder components. This transgenic model will greatly assist in an eventual understanding of the molecular pathology of HD and may open the way to the testing of intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2025197615,"Genes for familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) and episodic ataxia type-2 (EA-2) have been mapped to chromosome 19p13. We characterized a brain-specific P/Q-type Ca2+ channel α1-subunit gene, CACNL1A4, covering 300 kb with 47 exons. Sequencing of all exons and their surroundings revealed polymorphic variations, including a (CA)n-repeat (D19S1150), a (CAG)n-repeat in the 3′-UTR, and different types of deleterious mutations in FHM and EA-2. In FHM, we found four different missense mutations in conserved functional domains. One mutation has occurred on two different haplotypes in unrelated FHM families. In EA-2, we found two mutations disrupting the reading frame. Thus, FHM and EA-2 can be considered as allelic channelopathies. A similar etiology may be involved in common types of migraine."

Hamster and swine cells resistant to viral entry became susceptible upon expression of a human cDNA encoding this protein, designated HVEM (for herpesvirus entry mediator). HVEM was shown to mediate the entry of several wild-type HSV strains of both serotypes. Anti-HVEM antibodies and a soluble hybrid protein containing the HVEM ectodomain inhibited HVEM-dependent infection but not virus binding to cells. Mutations in the HSV envelope glycoprotein gD significantly reduced HVEM-mediated entry. The contribution of HVEM to HSV entry into human cells was demonstrable in activated T cells. HVEM, the first identified mediator of HSV entry, is a new member of the TNF/NGF receptor family."
https://openalex.org/W2046640957,"Cells respond to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by increasing transcription of genes encoding ER–resident proteins. The information is transmitted from the ER lumen to the nucleus by an intracellular signaling pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have identified a basic–leucine zipper transcription factor, Hac1p, that is required for the UPR and binds to the UPR element in the promoter of UPR–regulated genes. Surprisingly, Hac1p is found in UPR–activated cells only, and its level is controlled by regulated splicing of its mRNA. Splicing replaces the C-terminal tail of Hac1p with a different peptide that renders Hac1p more resistant to an otherwise extremely rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation. We propose that the complex regulation of Hac1p expression serves to provide multiple levels at which the UPR can be controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2028497134,"Secreted proteins of the Hedgehog (Hh) family have diverse organizing roles in animal development. Recently, a serpentine protein Smoothened (Smo) has been proposed as a Hh receptor. Here, we present evidence that implicates another multiple-pass transmembrane protein, Patched (Ptc), in Hh reception and suggests a novel signal transduction mechanism in which Hh binds to Ptc, or a Ptc–Smo complex, and thereby induces Smo activity. Our results also show that Ptc limits the range of Hh action; we provide evidence that high levels of Ptc induced by Hh serve to sequester any free Hh and therefore create a barrier to its further movement."

https://openalex.org/W2002410732,"Rac and Cdc42 regulate a variety of responses in mammalian cells including formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, activation of the JNK MAP kinase cascade, and induction of G1 cell cycle progression. Rac is also one of the downstream targets required for Ras- induced malignant transformation. Rac and Cdc42 containing a Y40C effector site substitution no longer intact with the Ser/Thr kinase p65PAK and are unable to activate the JNK MAP kinase pathway. However, they still induce cytoskeletal changes and G1 cell cycle progression. Rac containing an F37A effector site substitution, on the other hand, no longer interacts with the Ser/Thr kinase p160ROCK and is unable to induce lamellipodia or G1 progression. We conclude that Rac and Cdc42 control MAP kinase pathways and actin cytoskeleton organization independently through distinct downstream targets."
https://openalex.org/W2013944173,"Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypopigmentation, severe immunologic deficiency with neutropenia and lack of natural killer (NK) cells, a bleeding tendency and neurologic abnormalities1–4. Most patients die in childhood. The CHS hallmark is the occurrence of giant inclusion bodies and organelles in a variety of cell types, and protein sorting defects into these organelles5–8. Similar abnormalities occur in the beige mouse6,7,9–13, the proposed model for human CHS. Two groups have recently reported the identification of the beige gene14,15, however the two cDNAs were not at all similar. Here we describe the sequence of a human cDNA homologous to mouse beige, identify pathologic mutations and clarify the discrepancies of the previous reports. Analysis of the CHS polypeptide demonstrates that its modular architecture is similar to the yeast vacuolar sorting protein, VPS15."

https://openalex.org/W2040993603,"The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers an intracellular signaling pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR), that leads to increased transcription of genes encoding ER-resident proteins. Transcriptional activation is mediated by a dedicated transcription factor, Hac1p, whose activity is controlled by regulated splicing of its mRNA. We have identified a mutation in tRNA ligase that disrupts the UPR in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this mutant, splicing of HAC1 mRNA, but not tRNA, is blocked. In contrast, HAC1 mRNA splicing is not impaired in cells that are blocked in spliceosome-mediated mRNA splicing. Furthermore, the splice junctions of HAC1 mRNA do not conform to the consensus sequences of other yeast pre-mRNAs. Our results suggest that the regulated splicing of HAC1 mRNA occurs by a novel pathway, involving tRNA ligase and bypassing the spliceosome."

https://openalex.org/W2051377225,"Macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains use the β-chemokine receptor CCR5, but not CCR2b, as a cofactor for membrane fusion and infection, while the dual-tropic strain 89.6 uses both. CCR5/2b chimeras and mutants were used to map regions of CCR5 important for cofactor function and specificity. M-tropic strains required either the amino-terminal domain or the first extracellular loop of CCR5. A CCR2b chimera containing the first 20 N-terminal residues of CCR5 supported M-tropic envelope protein fusion. Amino-terminal truncations of CCR5/CCR2b chimeras indicated that residues 2–5 are important for M-tropic viruses, while 89.6 is dependent on residues 6–9. The identification of multiple functionally important regions in CCR5, coupled with differences in how CCR5 is used by M- and dual-tropic viruses, suggests that interactions between HIV-1 and entry cofactors are conformationally complex."
https://openalex.org/W1990244564,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor, the Met tyrosine kinase, are determinants of placenta, liver, and muscle development. Here, we show that Met function in vivo requires signaling via two carboxy-terminal tyrosines. Mutation of both residues in the mouse genome caused embryonal death, with placenta, liver, and limb muscle defects, mimicking the phenotype of met null mutants. In contrast, disrupting the consensus for Grb2 binding allowed development to proceed to term without affecting placenta and liver but caused a striking reduction in limb muscle coupled to a generalized deficit of secondary fibers. These data show that the requirements for Met signaling vary depending on the tissue and reveal a novel role for HGF/ Met in late myogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1992243707,"The ability of DNA binding transcription factors to access cis-acting promoter elements is critical for transcriptional responses. We demonstrate that rapid transcriptional autoactivation by the Amt1 Cu metalloregulatory transcription factor from the opportunistic pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata is dependent on rapid metal-induced DNA binding to a single metal response element (MRE). In vivo footprinting and chromatin-mapping experiments demonstrate that the MRE and a homopolymeric (dA x dT) element adjacent to the MRE are packaged into a positioned nucleosome that exhibits homopolymeric (dA x dT)-dependent localized distortion. This distortion is critical for rapid Amt1 binding to the MRE, for Cu-dependent AMT1 gene transcription, and for C. glabrata cells to mount a rapid transcriptional response to Cu for normal metal detoxification. The AMT1 promoter represents a novel class of specialized nucleosomal structures that links rapid transcriptional responses to the biology of metal homeostasis."
