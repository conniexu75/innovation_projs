Here, we analyzed prokaryotic genome and metagenome sequences to identify an uncharacterized family of RNA-guided, RNA-targeting CRISPR systems that we classify as type VI-D. Biochemical characterization and protein engineering of seven distinct orthologs generated a ribonuclease effector derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens XPD3002 (CasRx) with robust activity in human cells. CasRx-mediated knockdown exhibits high efficiency and specificity relative to RNA interference across diverse endogenous transcripts. As one of the most compact single-effector Cas enzymes, CasRx can also be flexibly packaged into adeno-associated virus. We target virally encoded, catalytically inactive CasRx to cis elements of pre-mRNA to manipulate alternative splicing, alleviating dysregulated tau isoform ratios in a neuronal model of frontotemporal dementia. Our results present CasRx as a programmable RNA-binding module for efficient targeting of cellular RNA, enabling a general platform for transcriptome engineering and future therapeutic development."

We engineered an RPE patch comprising a fully differentiated, human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived RPE monolayer on a coated, synthetic basement membrane. We delivered the patch, using a purpose-designed microsurgical tool, into the subretinal space of one eye in each of two patients with severe exudative AMD. Primary endpoints were incidence and severity of adverse events and proportion of subjects with improved best-corrected visual acuity of 15 letters or more. We report successful delivery and survival of the RPE patch by biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography, and a visual acuity gain of 29 and 21 letters in the two patients, respectively, over 12 months. Only local immunosuppression was used long-term. We also present the preclinical surgical, cell safety and tumorigenicity studies leading to trial approval. This work supports the feasibility and safety of hESC-RPE patch transplantation as a regenerative strategy for AMD."

Productivity of ruminant livestock depends on the rumen microbiota, which ferment indigestible plant polysaccharides into nutrients used for growth. Understanding the functions carried out by the rumen microbiota is important for reducing greenhouse gas production by ruminants and for developing biofuels from lignocellulose. We present 410 cultured bacteria and archaea, together with their reference genomes, representing every cultivated rumen-associated archaeal and bacterial family. We evaluate polysaccharide degradation, short-chain fatty acid production and methanogenesis pathways, and assign specific taxa to functions. A total of 336 organisms were present in available rumen metagenomic data sets, and 134 were present in human gut microbiome data sets. Comparison with the human microbiome revealed rumen-specific enrichment for genes encoding de novo synthesis of vitamin B12, ongoing evolution by gene loss and potential vertical inheritance of the rumen microbiome based on underrepresentation of markers of environmental stress. We estimate that our Hungate genome resource represents ∼75% of the genus-level bacterial and archaeal taxa present in the rumen."

https://openalex.org/W2793800931,"Blood cell formation is classically thought to occur through a hierarchical differentiation process, although recent studies have shown that lineage commitment may occur earlier in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The relevance to human blood diseases and the underlying regulation of these refined models remain poorly understood. By studying a genetic blood disorder, Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), where the majority of mutations affect ribosomal proteins and the erythroid lineage is selectively perturbed, we are able to gain mechanistic insight into how lineage commitment is programmed normally and disrupted in disease. We show that in DBA, the pool of available ribosomes is limited, while ribosome composition remains constant. Surprisingly, this global reduction in ribosome levels more profoundly alters translation of a select subset of transcripts. We show how the reduced translation of select transcripts in HSPCs can impair erythroid lineage commitment, illuminating a regulatory role for ribosome levels in cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2794087945,"Anatomically modern humans interbred with Neanderthals and with a related archaic population known as Denisovans. Genomes of several Neanderthals and one Denisovan have been sequenced, and these reference genomes have been used to detect introgressed genetic material in present-day human genomes. Segments of introgression also can be detected without use of reference genomes, and doing so can be advantageous for finding introgressed segments that are less closely related to the sequenced archaic genomes. We apply a new reference-free method for detecting archaic introgression to 5,639 whole-genome sequences from Eurasia and Oceania. We find Denisovan ancestry in populations from East and South Asia and Papuans. Denisovan ancestry comprises two components with differing similarity to the sequenced Altai Denisovan individual. This indicates that at least two distinct instances of Denisovan admixture into modern humans occurred, involving Denisovan populations that had different levels of relatedness to the sequenced Altai Denisovan.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJlODNmZTFiMjFlMDcwZWY0MTE3YjI0NTA2ZTliMjQ5ZSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4Nzg4MjYyfQ.XlMru6X7NX6s-EXtVZkh2-p--XLq-XQlrPYtuve5L5gYJI0J5ki6ndOXxQOysryytVffFtd8AZpl_6AD5TLN57KsoQB3nWjJ9CDpzj6S-dBb46PPB8bn8JU1rrkz4XCbcmwypZ_ylqy0-gi9eDDQsTWdZBxGaYWJLMDq-eHtGZ_eqyP7pZ8s2hgFZgVwWhXqd7gTgWG5RLNPJsArZIkjXjQnsAX0L7xv6ZBBEDVdkqUNX2KNn6uCqJbWWJsJ8quQftrsPYtnIAReIEzSjggL1kgsUAhOT19zBmhkOwkAW4SrT3IwGzowBsEXPnQiMqDo-RpHLeSdeL17zoucOJrFBg(mp4, (8.15 MB) Download video"

RNA structure regulates every gene studied here in a meaningful way, implying that most functional structures remain to be discovered. Nearly all RNA molecules fold into structures that are stabilized by networks of base-pairing interactions. These structures mediate numerous functions, ranging from catalysis to ligand-responsive gene regulation (Cech and Steitz, 2014Cech T.R. Steitz J.A. The noncoding RNA revolution-trashing old rules to forge new ones.Cell. 2014; 157: 77-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). In mRNAs, it is hypothesized that RNA structure broadly regulates gene translation efficiency (TE) (reviewed in Kozak, 2005Kozak M. Regulation of translation via mRNA structure in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Gene. 2005; 361: 13-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and numerous complex post-transcriptional regulatory structures have been identified in 5′ and 3′ UTRs (Cech and Steitz, 2014Cech T.R.

However, efforts to understand the prevalence and role of mRNA structure-based regulatory mechanisms have been hampered by long-standing challenges in RNA structure modeling. Recent transcriptome-wide structure-probing experiments have implied that mRNAs are frequently structured (Del Campo et al., 2015Del Campo C. Bartholomäus A. Fedyunin I. Ignatova Z.

Methods. 2017; 14: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but studies to date have lacked the resolution, quantitative accuracy, and comprehensive data coverage necessary to characterize structure at the level of individual mRNAs (Smola et al., 2015aSmola M.J. Calabrese J.M. Weeks K.M. Detection of RNA-Protein Interactions in Living Cells with SHAPE.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 6867-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Weeks, 2015Weeks K.M. Review toward all RNA structures, concisely.Biopolymers. 2015; 103: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In particular, there is no validated pathway for using dimethyl sulfate (DMS) probing data or ligation-dependent strategies to accurately model complex RNAs such as endogenous cellular mRNAs. Consequently, fundamental questions such as whether individual mRNAs adopt well-defined or dynamic structures, whether and why mRNA structure differs in vivo compared with ex vivo, and the extent to which RNA structures regulate gene expression have remained unresolved. Reliable structure models are essential for understanding mRNA-regulatory mechanisms. A prime example concerns the role, if any, RNA structure plays in tuning gene TE—the amount of protein produced from a given mRNA transcript. TE is a precisely tuned quantity, varying over 100-fold between different genes, and is central to how cells maintain protein homeostasis (Li et al., 2014Li G.-W. Burkhardt D. Gross C. Weissman J.S. Quantifying absolute protein synthesis rates reveals principles underlying allocation of cellular resources.Cell. 2014; 157: 624-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that RNA structural stability around the ribosome binding site (RBS) is a major determinant of TE for designed genes, primarily using reporter genes engineered to have specific compact structures in the vicinity of the translation start site (Goodman et al., 2013Goodman D.B. Church G.M. Kosuri S. Causes and effects of N-terminal codon bias in bacterial genes.Science. 2013; 342: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, Kudla et al., 2009Kudla G. Murray A.W.

Mirsky E.A. Voigt C.A. Automated design of synthetic ribosome binding sites to control protein expression.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Indeed, for synthetic genes, quantitative models can predict and allow rational tuning of TE (Salis et al., 2009Salis H.M. Mirsky E.A. Voigt C.A. Automated design of synthetic ribosome binding sites to control protein expression.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). However, studies of native, unmanipulated endogenous genes using poorly validated RNA structure models have observed poor correlations between TE and RBS structure (Boël et al., 2016Boël G. Letso R. Neely H. Price W.N. Wong K.-H. Su M. Luff J. Valecha M. Everett J.K.

USA. 2010; 107: 3645-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Several major studies have since proposed that TE is regulated via different mechanisms in endogenous genes (Boël et al., 2016Boël G. Letso R. Neely H. Price W.N. Wong K.-H. Su M. Luff J. Valecha M. Everett J.K.

Operon mRNAs are organized into ORF-centric structures that predict translation efficiency.eLife. 2017; 6: 811Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but, in the absence of confident RNA structural models, it is premature to draw firm conclusions. The ability to efficiently model accurate mRNA structures also has the potential to transform our understanding of the role of structure in mediating more complex forms of regulation. To date, discovery of new functional non-coding motifs has been largely restricted to bioinformatics and genetics strategies. These strategies work well for identifying large, broadly conserved structures, such as riboswitches and ribozymes (Weinberg et al., 2015Weinberg Z. Kim P.B. Chen T.H. Li S. Harris K.A. Lünse C.E. Breaker R.R. New classes of self-cleaving ribozymes revealed by comparative genomics analysis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), but suffer from unacceptably high false positive rates when trying to identify smaller or less conserved motifs (Eddy, 2014Eddy S.R. Computational analysis of conserved RNA secondary structure in transcriptomes and genomes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2014; 43: 433-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The prevalence of non-coding regulatory motifs genome-wide has therefore remained controversial, but it is likely that many functional motifs remain to be discovered. By comparison, starting with an accurate RNA structure model inverts the discovery problem and would potentially facilitate highly sensitive strategies for discovering novel RNA biology. In this study, we harness recent technological advances to create the first “no compromises” RNA structure probing dataset on a transcriptome-wide scale. This conceptual advance allows us to dissect the mechanisms shaping in-cell RNA structure with unparalleled resolution and enables accurate structure modeling for hundreds of mRNA transcripts. These structure models, in turn, allow us to test key hypotheses regarding the prevalence and function of mRNA structure. Overall, our work establishes RNA structure as a pervasive and fundamental regulator of gene expression, likely directing the expression of every gene in E. coli. We used the selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) (Siegfried et al., 2014Siegfried N.A. Busan S. Rice G.M. Nelson J.A.E. Weeks K.M.

SHAPE reactivities are proportional to local nucleotide flexibility and, thus, provide a direct measure of the extent of RNA structure. Using the extensively validated reagent 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7), we probed RNA structure under three conditions: in living E. coli cells during mid-log growth in liquid culture; in living cells treated with the antibiotic kasugamycin, which inhibits translation initiation; and in protein- and ribosome-free extracts maintained in native-like buffers, which we refer to as cell-free (Figure 1A). Critically for this study, we focused on studying the subset of native mRNAs in E. coli for which it was possible to acquire near-complete and very high-quality chemical probing data. This approach is thus distinct from prior transcriptome-scale studies, which used most or all collected data but, because of data sparseness and irregularity at the per-nucleotide level, required most chemical probing information to be averaged over many genes or averaged over large regions of an RNA. We applied an unbiased whole-transcriptome sequencing strategy that yielded high-quality structural data for 194 highly expressed transcripts, encoding approximately 400 genes, that met stringent read depth and completeness thresholds (Figure 1B; Siegfried et al., 2014Siegfried N.A.

These datasets are of comparable quality as those collected in focused studies of individual RNAs (Figure 1C). 1M7 readily penetrates E. coli cells (McGinnis et al., 2015McGinnis J.L. Liu Q.

We initially characterized structural variation across different classes of RNA based on their cell-free SHAPE reactivities. Nucleotide-resolution SHAPE data immediately revealed the enormous diversity in RNA structure across E. coli genes (Figures 1B and 1C). This structural heterogeneity is obscured in meta-gene analyses (Figure S2), and, clearly, no individual RNA has a structure matching that of an averaged meta-gene. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and pre-tRNAs have low SHAPE reactivities (Figures 1B and 1C), consistent with these ncRNAs possessing stable, well-defined secondary and tertiary structures. By comparison, SHAPE reactivities of coding regions vary dramatically. Some genes exhibit very little stable structure, and others are structured to degrees similar to that of ncRNAs (Figures 1B and 1C). Within a given gene product category, there is again a wide diversity in mRNA structure (Figure 1C). There is no periodicity in the reactivity profiles of coding regions, indicating that, at least in E. coli, mRNA structure is not periodic (Figure S2). We suggest that periodicities observed in other studies may reflect sequence biases of non-MaP-based structure-probing methods and, for structures probed in cells, second-order effects of local ribosome-induced unfolding (STAR Methods). Overall, mRNA structures are diverse and largely orthogonal to gene identity and, thus, potentially able to exert heterogeneous and transcript-specific roles in regulating gene expression. Comparisons between in-cell and cell-free datasets revealed that the cellular environment has a significant effect on mRNA structure. Specifically, coding regions are less structured (have higher SHAPE reactivities) in cells than under cell-free conditions (Figure 1D), consistent with observations from prior studies (Burkhardt et al., 2017Burkhardt D.H.

Structural imprints in vivo decode RNA regulatory mechanisms.Nature. 2015; 519: 486-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this structural destabilization was due to ribosome-induced mRNA unfolding during translation (Takyar et al., 2005Takyar S. Hickerson R.P. Noller H.F. mRNA helicase activity of the ribosome.Cell. 2005; 120: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and, therefore, examined the relationship between in-cell SHAPE reactivity and gene TE, which is proportional to average ribosome occupancy (Li et al., 2014Li G.-W. Burkhardt D. Gross C. Weissman J.S. Quantifying absolute protein synthesis rates reveals principles underlying allocation of cellular resources.Cell. 2014; 157: 624-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Three lines of evidence support that mRNA structural disruption observed in cells is primarily due to transient unfolding caused by active translation. First, we observe strong transcriptome-wide correlations between gene TE and in-cell SHAPE reactivity but not with cell-free SHAPE reactivity (Figure 2A). Second, in polycistronic transcripts, in-cell SHAPE reactivities increase precisely in highly translated genes, whereas genes on the same transcript with low TE have comparable in-cell and cell-free reactivities (Figure 2B). Third, compared with normal in-cell conditions, SHAPE reactivity decreases when translation is partially inhibited by the antibiotic kasugamycin, and the correlation between TE and SHAPE reactivity is sharply reduced (Figures 2A and 2B). By contrast, kasugamycin treatment has no effect on the structure of ncRNAs; any structural destabilization is constant across both in-cell conditions, consistent with the action expected of chaperone proteins such as Hfq (Figure 2C). Thus, although multiple cellular factors can remodel RNA structure in vivo, ribosome-induced unfolding is a primary cause of mRNA destabilization in cells, and this destabilization correlates with the translation level of individual genes. Despite the destabilization caused by translation, SHAPE reactivities under in-cell, cell-free, and kasugamycin-treated conditions remain strongly correlated, suggesting that RNA structure is, on average, maintained in cells (Figures 1D and S2). A unique advantage of 1M7 SHAPE-MaP data is that they can be used to guide accurate secondary structure modeling using extensively validated strategies (Siegfried et al., 2014Siegfried N.A. Busan S. Rice G.M. Nelson J.A.E. Weeks K.M. RNA motif discovery by SHAPE and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP).Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Structural modeling was performed for all transcripts under each condition with sufficient SHAPE data, yielding both minimum free energy structure models and base-pairing probabilities. Consistent with the enormous diversity among SHAPE reactivity profiles, different transcripts exhibit highly variable degrees of structure (Figure S3). For some transcripts, 50% of nucleotides form high-probability base pairs, indicating that the mRNA adopts a well-defined global structure. For other transcripts, only ∼10% of nucleotides form well-defined base pairs, indicating that the mRNA structure is highly dynamic. In-cell structure models have ∼20% fewer base pairs than cell-free and kasugamycin structure models (Figure S3), consistent with translation-induced structural destabilization. Highly translated coding regions are selectively depleted of high-probability long-range base pairs in cells, implying that ribosome-induced unfolding specifically disfavors long-range pairing (Figure 2D). Nevertheless, more than 60% of minimum free energy and more than 70% of high-probability base pairs are shared between in-cell, cell-free, and kasugamycin structure models (Figures 2E and S3), and most structural differences are localized to dynamic regions (STAR Methods). By contrast, structure models predicted without SHAPE data deviate significantly from data-driven models (Figures 2E and S3). In sum, RNA structure is destabilized in the cellular environment by active translation such that translation disfavors long-range base pairing. Nonetheless, in-cell RNA structure does not appear to undergo radical changes, leaving intact the potential for RNA structure to regulate cellular processes. Our SHAPE-directed structure models provide an unparalleled resource for exploring hypotheses regarding the cellular functions of mRNA structure. One of the most important potential functions of mRNA structure is as a regulator of gene TE. Seminal studies of simplified model genes have shown that RNA structures that occlude the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and beginning of the coding sequence—collectively termed the RBS—impede loading of the gene into the mRNA binding channel of the 30S ribosomal subunit and, therefore, reduce TE (de Smit and van Duin, 1990de Smit M.H. van Duin J.

In contrast, studies of authentic native genes have reported that RBS structure is only weakly correlated with TE (Boël et al., 2016Boël G. Letso R. Neely H. Price W.N. Wong K.-H. Su M. Luff J.

USA. 2010; 107: 3645-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that average structure across the entire coding sequence (CDS), rather than RBS structure, is the key determinant of TE for endogenous native genes (Burkhardt et al., 2017Burkhardt D.H. Rouskin S. Zhang Y. Li G.-W. Weissman J.S. Gross C.A. Operon mRNAs are organized into ORF-centric structures that predict translation efficiency.eLife. 2017; 6: 811Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, all of these studies relied on naive prediction or unvalidated RNA structure-modeling strategies. Understanding TE in endogenous polycistronic transcripts is complicated by the phenomena of translational coupling, where translation of a downstream gene is dependent on and coupled to translation of upstream genes (Kozak, 2005Kozak M. Regulation of translation via mRNA structure in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Gene. 2005; 361: 13-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Because the mechanism of translation initiation likely differs in translationally coupled genes, we excluded possible translationally coupled genes from our analysis (Figure 3A). Genes were required to be either the first gene on the transcript or have more than a 2-fold different TE than the immediate upstream gene. The distinct role of RNA structure in translational coupling is discussed later. We used our SHAPE-directed structure models to examine two alternative biophysical mechanisms through which RBS structure may regulate mRNA loading onto the 30S subunit during translation initiation. If loading is an equilibrium process, then TE should vary with the equilibrium free energy of unfolding the RBS structure (ΔGunfold) (Figure 3B; Salis et al., 2009Salis H.M. Mirsky E.A. Voigt C.A.

Further, targeted proteolysis is an emerging research tool and therapeutic strategy. However, proteome-wide technologies to investigate the causes and consequences of protein degradation in biological systems are lacking. We developed proteome dynamics profiling (mPDP), a mass-spectrometry-based approach combining dynamic-SILAC labeling with isobaric mass tagging for multiplexed analysis of protein degradation and synthesis. In three proof-of-concept studies, we uncover different responses induced by the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 versus a JQ1 proteolysis targeting chimera; we elucidate distinct modes of action of estrogen receptor modulators; and we comprehensively classify HSP90 clients based on their requirement for HSP90 constitutively or during synthesis, demonstrating that constitutive HSP90 clients have lower thermal stability than non-clients, have higher affinity for the chaperone, vary between cell types, and change upon external stimuli. These findings highlight the potential of mPDP to identify dynamically controlled degradation mechanisms in cellular systems."

However, it is unknown whether transplanted MGE cells can reduce hAPP/Aβ-dependent behavioral and network dysfunctions in brains with chronically elevated levels of Aβ in the absence of extensive interneuron loss. Here we demonstrate that brain transplants of wild-type, Nav1.1-overexpressing, or Nav1.1-deficient interneuron progenitors have very different effects on network and cognitive functions in hAPP-J20 and wild-type mice, and we suggest that molecular modification to counteract pathogenic contexts will likely be required to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of cell transplants for neurological disorders. We chose hAPP-J20 (J20) mice as recipients for interneuron transplants because they have robust cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze and fear conditioning tests, network hypersynchrony, reduced gamma oscillatory power, and multiple other features that resemble AD in humans (Palop et al., 2007Palop J.J.

We show here that layer 6 (L6) principal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) receive a diffuse, vestibular-mediated synaptic input that signals the angular velocity of horizontal rotation. Behavioral and theoretical experiments indicate that these inputs, distributed over a network of 100 L6 neurons, provide both a reliable estimate and, therefore, physiological separation of head-velocity signals. During head rotation in the presence of visual stimuli, L6 neurons exhibit postsynaptic responses that approximate the arithmetic sum of the vestibular and visual-motion response. Functional input mapping reveals that these internal motion signals arrive into L6 via a direct projection from the retrosplenial cortex. We therefore propose that visual-motion processing in V1 L6 is multisensory and contextually dependent on the motion status of the animal’s head.

To investigate whether V1 has access to head-motion signals, we performed extracellular and whole-cell recordings in the left brain hemisphere of awake, head-fixed mice during passive rotation in complete darkness (Arenz et al., 2008Arenz A. Silver R.A. Schaefer A.T. Margrie T.W. The contribution of single synapses to sensory representation in vivo.Science. 2008; 321: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). First, using a dense silicon probe that enables us to record simultaneously across all cortical layers (Jun et al., 2017Jun J.J. Steinmetz N.A. Siegle J.H. Denman D.J. Bauza M. Barbarits B. Lee A.K. Anastassiou C.A. Andrei A. Aydın Ç. et al.Fully integrated silicon probes for high-density recording of neural activity.Nature. 2017; 551: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), we found that well-isolated units (n = 28 units, n = 3 mice) located in layers 5 (L5) and 6 were most likely to show rotation-evoked activity (L5, 2/7; L6, 9/14; compared to L4, n = 1/7, significance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure 1A). The inability to isolate units in L2/3 (Saleem et al., 2013Saleem A.B. Ayaz A. Jeffery K.J. Harris K.D. Carandini M. Integration of visual motion and locomotion in mouse visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) motivated us to confirm these initial data using whole-cell recordings. In line with the extracellular data, while rotation-evoked action potential activity was not observed in L2/3 regular spiking neurons (L2/3, 0/8, significance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), responses were observed in deep-layer principal cells (L5, 2/5 cells; L6, 9/16 cells; significance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Taken together, both extra- and intra-cellular recording approaches showed that deep-layer V1 neurons receive and broadcast a head-motion signal. Given the known RSP projection onto V1 L6 (Vélez-Fort et al., 2014Vélez-Fort M. Rousseau C.V. Niedworok C.J. Wickersham I.R. Rancz E.A. Brown A.P.Y. Strom M. Margrie T.W. The stimulus selectivity and connectivity of layer six principal cells reveals cortical microcircuits underlying visual processing.Neuron. 2014; 83: 1431-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the large fraction of cells that responded to rotation, we focused on L6 neurons to investigate the underlying synaptic properties of these responses. First, the membrane potential of nearly all L6 cells (n = 13/16 cells, significance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figures 1B and 1C) was found either to significantly depolarize or to hyperpolarize when the animal was rotated in either the clockwise (CW, n = 10/16 cells) or counter-clockwise (CCW; n = 9/16 cells) direction. The overall average of the peak amplitude of the response was 11.28 ± 1.12 mV (n = 13 cells, n = 19 directions). The overall mean membrane potential response calculated across the entire rotation trajectory (−90° to +90° or vice versa) was 1.80 ± 0.35 mV. Since the probability of observing responses in cortico-thalamic (CT) and cortico-cortical (CC) neurons was similar (CT, 10/13 cells versus CC, 3/3 cells; p = 1, Fisher exact test; STAR Methods), these two cell types were pooled for the remainder of the analysis. Qualitatively, a small fraction of cells showed tonic membrane potential depolarizations during rotation. In the majority of cases, however, the membrane potential of cells appeared to respond according to the speed of rotation. Overall, these responses fell into three general types: first, “ON responses” were characterized by a synaptic depolarization and often firing of action potentials during rotation in either (selective) or both (non-selective) directions (n = 9/13 cells; Figure 1D). Second, “OFF responses” showed a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential in either or both directions (n = 2/13 cells; Figure 1E), while the third category of responses was characterized by a significant membrane potential depolarization in one direction and a hyperpolarization in the other, and was thus classified as direction-specific “ON/OFF responses” (n = 2/13 cells; Figure 1F). At the population level, rotation-evoked synaptic input onto L6 cells appeared widespread and showed a broad range of selectivity to the direction of rotation (Figure 1G). To determine the sensory origin of these L6 inputs, we bilaterally perturbed the posterior and horizontal semi-circular canals and injected the ototoxic antibacterial agent kanamycin. Lesioning the canals produced a circling behavioral phenotype consistent with vestibular dysfunction (Valerio and Taube, 2016Valerio S. Taube J.S. Head direction cell activity is absent in mice without the horizontal semicircular canals.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Vidal et al., 2004Vidal P.-P. Degallaix L. Josset P. Gasc J.-P. Cullen K.E. Postural and locomotor control in normal and vestibularly deficient mice.J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Figures S1A and S1B) and the complete loss of rotation-evoked subthreshold responses (control, n = 19/32 directions versus lesioned, n = 0/14 directions; n = 7 cells [6 CT and 1 CC], p = 5 × 10−4, Fisher exact test; Figure 1H), while responses to visual stimuli remained comparable to non-lesioned mice (mean membrane potential response calculated across the entire rotation trajectory from baseline, control, 2.33 ± 0.26 mV versus lesioned, 3.18 ± 0.67 mV; p = 0.46, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figures 1H and 1I). To explore the possibility that changes in eye position could account for these observed rotation-evoked responses (Toyama et al., 1984Toyama K. Komatsu Y. Shibuki K. Integration of retinal and motor signals of eye movements in striate cortex cells of the alert cat.J. Neurophysiol. 1984; 51: 649-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we also performed event-triggered averaging of the membrane potential while monitoring the position of both eyes under infrared illumination. We found no correlative evidence for eye position-related L6 membrane potential responses (n = 349 temporal-medial events, n = 192 medial-temporal events, n = 3 cells, significance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figures S2A and S2B). Furthermore, we found no correlative evidence for spontaneous eye position-related membrane potential responses (n = 6 temporal to medial events, n = 3 cells, significance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In addition, peri-ocular injections of Lidocaine that reduced eye mobility did not impact either the likelihood of observing evoked responses (n = 3/3 cells, p = 1, Fisher exact test; Figures S3A–S3C) or the mean membrane potential response calculated across the entire rotation trajectory (control, 1.80 ± 0.35 mV, n = 19 directions versus Lidocaine, 1.65 ± 0.49 mV, n = 4 directions; p = 0.78, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure S3C). We therefore included these cells for all subsequent analysis. Taken together, these data show that these membrane potential responses in V1 L6 neurons are not due to changes in eye position but instead arise from sensory transduction in the vestibular apparatus, and can be attributed to the motion of the head during passive rotation. To explore the motion-encoding properties of these inputs, we identified all cells where the average amplitude of the postsynaptic membrane potential response changed significantly during rotation in either direction (n = 19 cells, n = 23 directions). For each direction, we then re-sampled the membrane potential data so that each velocity bin (0.008°/s) contained the same number of data points (1 data point per bin; STAR Methods; Figures 2A and 2B ). We then performed circular permutations of the angular velocity of each trial (bin size = 0.008°/s, 10,000 iterations per direction) while retaining the temporal structure of the membrane voltage response (Figure 2B). Linear regression analysis was then performed on the “shuffled” and “raw” (non-shuffled) membrane potential data (STAR Methods). In contrast to the shuffled data, we found that the angular velocity was often linearly correlated to the recorded membrane potential. Indeed, in 14/23 cases the calculated R2 value for the evoked membrane potential was significantly larger when compared to the distribution of R2 values obtained for the shuffled data (significance threshold p = 0.05; Figure 2B) and responses recorded in lesioned animals (control, R2 = 0.32 ± 0.06, n = 23 directions versus lesioned, R2 = 0.11 ± 0.03, n = 14 directions; p = 0.02, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). By way of comparison, the R2 values determined for angular velocity significantly exceeded those determined for acceleration (velocity, R2 = 0.32 ± 0.06, n = 23 directions versus acceleration, R2 = 0.15 ± 0.03, n = 23 directions; p = 0.04, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), which were not significantly different between intact and lesioned mice (control, R2 = 0.15 ± 0.03, n = 23 directions versus lesioned, R2 = 0.10 ± 0.04, n = 14 directions; p = 0.08, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figures 2C and 2D). Taken together, these data show that for the majority of V1 L6 neurons showing evoked responses, the membrane potential response indicates the angular velocity of rotation. Presumably, the quality and potential physiological significance of these V1 responses would be reflected by their signal-to-noise ratio, which can be quantified using a variety of theoretical approaches, such as mutual information and Bayes’ theorem (Arenz et al., 2008Arenz A. Silver R.A. Schaefer A.T. Margrie T.W. The contribution of single synapses to sensory representation in vivo.Science. 2008; 321: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, Thiel et al., 2007Thiel A. Greschner M. Eurich C.W. Ammermüller J. Kretzberg J. Contribution of individual retinal ganglion cell responses to velocity and acceleration encoding.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 2285-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of directly relevant behavioral data, theoretical estimates are difficult to interpret. If V1 networks use these inputs to generate a comprehensive and integrative map of internal and external motion signals, we argued (1) that the theoretical resolution of these physiological responses should approach the psychophysical limits of the animal’s ability to distinguish “self-motion” and (2) that realistic-sized networks of L6 neurons should be able to extract angular velocity information on a moment-to-moment basis. To begin to investigate the fidelity of these V1 responses, we trained head-fixed mice in total darkness on a go/no-go task (n = 5 mice) requiring them to discriminate passive rotations whereby a non-rewarded rotation stimulus (S−, range = 0–27°/s) was paired with a rewarded stimulus with a larger peak velocity (S+, range = 0–80°/s; Figures 3A and S4A). Using this stimulus pair, we found that mice could, above chance, accurately and reliably discern the speed of horizontal rotation (Figure 3B). To assess the contribution of vestibular signaling, we performed bilateral lesions of the posterior and horizontal semi-circular canals and injected the ototoxic antibacterial agent kanamycin. After recovery, animals’ rotation discrimination performance fell to almost chance levels for the same pre-treatment stimulus pair (average discrimination score last 10 blocks pre-treatment, 91.4% ± 0.9% accuracy versus average first 10 blocks post-treatment, 62.3% ± 1.9% accuracy; p < 10−6, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction; Figure 3B). In contrast, the same mice continued to reliably discriminate odor stimuli that we interleaved with the rotation stimuli (last 10 blocks pre-treatment, 90.5% ± 1.3% accuracy versus first 10 blocks post-treatment, 93.0% ± 1.1% accuracy; p = 1, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction; Figure 3B), indicating that, while vestibular lesions appeared not to impact general motivation or attention, rotation discrimination performance strongly relied on the vestibular organ. In another set of experiments (n = 4 mice), once mice reached criterion performance levels for discrimination, we reduced the velocity peak amplitude of the S+ without altering the times of"

Fluent production of learned vocalizations requires continual evaluation of performances using auditory feedback. Changes in neuronal activity, indicating whether vocal performances are well and/or poorly performed relative to performance goals, may provide general mechanisms for maintaining and shaping vocalizations (Fee and Goldberg, 2011Fee M.S.

However, it is not known whether evaluative signals indicating better performances or worse performances are sufficient to guide adaptive changes in vocal behaviors, or how such signals are implemented in the brain.

The striatum is a main input hub of the basal ganglia, and striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) integrate inputs from the cortex and from dopaminergic neurons in VTA and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) (Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012Tritsch N.X.

These findings raise the possibility that dopaminergic inputs to the striatum may also play a role in learning of fine motor skills involved in vocal performance (Hoffmann et al., 2016Hoffmann L.A.

Indeed, lesion and pharmacological inactivation studies in songbirds indicate that the output of the vocal basal ganglia circuitry is important for initial song learning (Bottjer et al., 1984Bottjer S.W.

Mechanisms and time course of vocal learning and consolidation in the adult songbird.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1806-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, inputs from the VTA encode “performance errors,” a signal thought to reflect whether songs were correctly or incorrectly performed relative to performance goals (Gadagkar et al., 2016Gadagkar V. Puzerey P.A. Chen R. Baird-Daniel E. Farhang A.R. Goldberg J.H. Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds.Science. 2016; 354: 1278-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of these evaluative signals in vocal learning is not known, and several fundamental questions regarding the function of VTA projections to the basal ganglia are left unresolved. For example, are phasic changes in VTA activity sufficient to instruct changes in vocal performance? Does VTA have direct effects on ongoing song performances, or primarily function to instruct changes in future performances? Are evaluative signals from VTA sufficient to guide learning of an individual vocal parameter even when embedded within a larger vocal sequence? To address these and other related questions, we developed axon-targeted optogenetic methods to excite or inhibit VTA axon terminals in the vocal basal ganglia of freely singing zebra finches. On-line assessment of the fundamental frequency (pitch) of a targeted song syllable permitted precise trial-to-trial targeting of optical manipulations based on natural variation in syllable pitch. We find that activation or inhibition of VTA axon terminals is sufficient to guide learned changes in the future performance of single song syllables within the birds’ larger polysyllabic song. Moreover, activation and inhibition guide rapid and reliable pitch learning in opposing directions. These findings define a minimal synaptic circuit for vocal learning and highlight unexpected precision in how the VTA-basal ganglia pathway can guide changes to vocal behaviors. We first tested the ability of zebra finches to adaptively modify the pitch of a song syllable in a negative reinforcement learning task (Ali et al., 2013Ali F. Otchy T.M. Pehlevan C. Fantana A.L.

Performance variability enables adaptive plasticity of “crystallized” adult birdsong.Nature. 2007; 450: 1240-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Zebra finches practice their song hundreds to thousands of times each day and exhibit a small amount of natural, trial-to-trial variability in how they produce the pitch of individual syllables. Pitch-contingent auditory feedback (pCAF; Figures 1A–1F) triggers playback of white noise when the pitch of a syllable is below or above an experimenter-defined threshold. Brief pulses of white noise playback are thought to function as an aversive cue, perhaps perceived as an error in vocal performance (Tumer and Brainard, 2007Tumer E.C. Brainard M.S. Performance variability enables adaptive plasticity of “crystallized” adult birdsong.Nature. 2007; 450: 1240-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Birds rapidly learned to shift the pitch of the pCAF-targeted syllable throughout the day, exhibiting significant increases in the pitch of the targeted syllable and significant decreases in the number of syllables that fell below the threshold for white noise playback (Figures 1E and 1F). These findings confirm the ability of zebra finches to rapidly and selectively modify their song in a negative reinforcement task. Learning to shift the pitch of an individual syllable embedded in a complex song motif is a form of motor skill learning that may depend on positive and/or negative reinforcement signals from VTA to Area X (Gadagkar et al., 2016Gadagkar V. Puzerey P.A. Chen R. Baird-Daniel E. Farhang A.R. Goldberg J.H. Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds.Science. 2016; 354: 1278-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Figures 1G and 1H). To test whether phasic increases or decreases in VTAAX activity are sufficient to guide song learning, we sought to optogenetically manipulate VTAAX axon terminals in freely singing birds. To enhance axonal distribution and membrane trafficking of virally expressed opsins, the intracellular targeting sequence of neurexin 1α was attached to the C-terminal end of channelrhodopsin (ChR2) or archaerhodopsin (ArchT), resulting in adeno-associated virus (AAV) viral constructs referred to here as axChR2 and axArchT.

While the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was identified as a tumor suppressor in multiple types of cancer, our genetic studies revealed an essential role of PP2A in B cell tumors. Thereby, PP2A redirects glucose carbon utilization from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to salvage oxidative stress. This unique vulnerability reflects constitutively low PPP activity in B cells and transcriptional repression of G6PD and other key PPP enzymes by the B cell transcription factors PAX5 and IKZF1. Reflecting B-cell-specific transcriptional PPP-repression, glucose carbon utilization in B cells is heavily skewed in favor of glycolysis resulting in lack of PPP-dependent antioxidant protection. These findings reveal a gatekeeper function of the PPP in a broad range of B cell malignancies that can be efficiently targeted by small molecule inhibition of PP2A and G6PD."
https://openalex.org/W2791766571,"Multiple genetic mutations within melanoma not only cause lesion-specific responses to targeted therapy but also alter the molecular route of resistance to that therapy. Inactivation of PTEN occurs in up to 30% of melanomas, frequently with a concurrent activating BRAF mutation. PTEN loss regulates both acquired and intrinsic drug resistance. Here we show that AXL/AKT axis mediated-resistance to BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) depends upon PTEN status in melanoma. Hyperactivation of both ERK and AKT pathways was associated with BRAFi resistance in melanoma with wildtype PTEN. The PTEN-impaired melanoma cells required only the ERK resistance mechanism. Moreover, we identified AXL as a key upstream effector of AKT pathway-associated resistance to BRAFi in melanoma with wildtype PTEN, but not in melanoma with impaired PTEN. Notably, we confirmed that blocking AXL by shRNA and a small molecular inhibitor could rescue the sensitivity of resistant melanoma cells with wildtype PTEN to BRAFi and inhibit their growth in vitro and in vivo. Our study has uncovered a mechanism by which PTEN status contributes to acquired resistance to BRAFi and offers a rational strategy to guide clinical testing in pre-identified subsets of patients who relapse during treatment with BRAFi. The identified protein AXL represents a promising therapeutic target for BRAF mutant melanoma patients with wildtype PTEN."
https://openalex.org/W2791308721,"We investigated the numbers of planktonic and biofilm cells and the expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps and biofilm-related proteins in 10 clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRA) as well as in its standard strain ATCC 19606 in the presence of colistin (CST), polymyxin B (PMB), minomycin (MIN), and tigecycline (TGC) at their respective sub-MICs. The number of planktonic and biofilm cells of ATCC 19606 decreased in the presence of all aforementioned antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner. Cell number also decreased in two representative MDRA strains, R2 and R3, in the presence of MIN and TGC in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the number of biofilm cells in these two strains increased in the presence of CST, while they increased significantly in the presence of PMB in R2 only. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the number of biofilm cells was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding efflux pumps (adeB and adeG) and autoinducer synthase (abaI) in strain R2 and adeB, adeG, adeJ, poly-acetyl-glucosamine-porin (pgaA), and abaI in strain R3 in the presence of CST. It was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding adeB in strain R2 and an outer membrane protein A (ompA) and biofilm-associated protein (bap) in strain R3 in the presence of PMB. These results provide valuable insights into the biofilm formation potency of clinical isolates of MDRA that depends on efflux pumps and biofilm-related genes and its regulation by antibiotics."

We quantitatively dissect the role of DNAme in directing somatic cell fate with high-resolution genome-wide bisulfite-, bulk-, and single-cell-RNA sequencing. We find defects in neuralization and MN differentiation in DNMT3A knockouts (KO) that can be rescued by the targeting of DNAme to key developmental loci using catalytically inactive dCas9. We also find decreased dendritic arborization and altered electrophysiological properties in DNMT3A KO MNs.

Examination of the hundreds of human or mouse KRAB-ZF proteins shows they contain tandem ZFs ranging from 3 to ∼35 fingers, with an average array size of 11–13 fingers (Liu et al., 2013Liu Y.

These studies suggest that new KRAB-ZF proteins emerge in response to invading transposable elements, followed by eventual deterioration of the KRAB-ZF proteins as target elements decay by genetic drift, except in cases where the KRAB-ZF proteins may have been integrated into an important gene regulatory network. In support of this model, several dozen KRAB-ZF proteins that emerged in eutherian mammals have retained DNA binding fingerprints, at least one of which, Zfp57, has maintained its ancestral function in regulating imprint control regions in diverse mammals including humans (Li et al., 2008Li X.

Wang Y. Hoang D. Tinkham M. Patel A. Sun M.A. Wolf G. Baker M. Chien H.C. Lai K.N. et al.A placental growth factor is silenced in mouse embryos by the zinc finger protein ZFP568.Science. 2017; 356: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ZFP568 comprises three broad regions: two N-terminal KRAB domains, followed by an uncharacterized region, a C-terminal tandem array of 11 fingers (Figure 1A), and functions via direct binding to a ∼24 nucleotide motif found upstream of the Igf2-P0 promoter where it establishes H3K9 methylation-dependent silencing (Yang et al., 2017Yang P. Wang Y. Hoang D. Tinkham M. Patel A. Sun M.A. Wolf G. Baker M. Chien H.C. Lai K.N. et al.A placental growth factor is silenced in mouse embryos by the zinc finger protein ZFP568.Science. 2017; 356: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ZNF568, the human ortholog of mouse Zfp568, was identified in a screen for rapidly evolving genes in humans relative to chimpanzees and has three allele variants within human population (Chien et al., 2012Chien H.C. Wang H.Y. Su Y.N. Lai K.Y. Lu L.C. Chen P.C. Tsai S.F. Wu C.I. Hsieh W.S. Shen C.K. Targeted disruption in mice of a neural stem cell-maintaining, KRAB-Zn finger-encoding gene that has rapidly evolved in the human lineage.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e47481Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All three alleles have accumulated substitutions that potentially disrupt the function of the KRAB and ZF domains. We thus sought to explore whether ZFP568-based silencing of Igf2-P0 was generally a conserved feature in mammals and whether this function might be lost in humans. In conventional C2H2 ZF proteins, each finger comprises two β strands and a helix and interacts with three adjacent DNA base pairs (Choo and Klug, 1997Choo Y. Klug A. Physical basis of a protein-DNA recognition code.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, Pavletich and Pabo, 1991Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O.

When bound to DNA, the helix of each ZF lies in the DNA major groove, and side chains from specific amino acids within the N-terminal portion of each helix and the preceding loop make hydrogen-bond (H-bond) contacts with the bases of primarily one DNA strand. The identities of these amino acids are the principle determinants of the DNA sequence recognized in a well-characterized three-fingered system (Gupta et al., 2014Gupta A. Christensen R.G. Bell H.A.

The one finger-three base rule is preserved for five to six finger tandem arrays either in a designed six-fingered protein or in PRDM9 and CTCF (Hashimoto et al., 2017Hashimoto H. Wang D. Horton J.R.

Here, we show that the 11-finger tandem array of mouse ZFP568 (mZFP568) deviates from this rule by interacting with 2, 3, or 4 bases per finger and by interacting with the opposite strand for a stretch of five thymine bases. To identify ZFP568 orthologs, we used reciprocal BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Basic local alignment search tool.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70619) Google Scholar) with the mZFP568 as a query and identified orthologs in all eutherian mammals examined but not platypus or marsupials (Table S1). Most orthologs had the same basic structure of one or two KRAB domains at the N terminus with an 11-finger array at the C terminus (Figures 1A and S1A). Sequence alignments showed considerable conservation of base-interacting residues relative to other amino acids within the zinc fingers with the exception of the first two fingers (Figure S1B). To determine whether ZFP568 orthologs were therefore evolving under selective pressure, we calculated the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS ratio). We found that ZFP568 orthologs were largely evolving under purifying selection with a dN/dS <1 (Figure 1B). One notable exception is three allele variants of human ZNF568, which evolve under positive selection with very high dN/dS (Figure 1B). In mice, the primary function of mZFP568 is the repression of the placental-specific transcript Igf2-P0 via the direct binding to an upstream 24 nucleotide sequence that matches the mZFP568 binding motif inferred from ChIP-seq data (Yang et al., 2017Yang P. Wang Y. Hoang D. Tinkham M. Patel A. Sun M.A. Wolf G. Baker M. Chien H.C. Lai K.N. et al.A placental growth factor is silenced in mouse embryos by the zinc finger protein ZFP568.Science. 2017; 356: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We searched the genomes of mammals using BLAT (Kent, 2002Kent W.J. BLAT--the BLAST-like alignment tool.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar) and found the binding site to be highly conserved, with 15 of the 24 nucleotides to be invariant among the seventeen species examined (Figure 1C). Importantly, these residues match the invariant nucleotides of the ChIP-seq motif (Figure 1D). The consensus sequence is generally rich in guanines, but contains a stretch of 4–5 adenines toward the 3′ end. We note that the consensus sequence does not match the predicted DNA-binding specificity of mZFP568 by a computational algorithm (Persikov and Singh, 2014Persikov A.V. Singh M. De novo prediction of DNA-binding specificities for Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), particularly for the poly-adenine sequence (Figure 1E). Using PhastCons (Siepel et al., 2005Siepel A. Bejerano G. Pedersen J.S. Hinrichs A.S. Hou M. Rosenbloom K. Clawson H. Spieth J. Hillier L.W. Richards S. et al.Evolutionarily conserved elements in vertebrate, insect, worm, and yeast genomes.Genome Res. 2005; 15: 1034-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar), we could determine that just upstream of the binding site there was very little conservation in mammals, whereas downstream conservation increased, consistent with the downstream region being part of the Igf2-P0 first exon as well as the final exon of the Igf2-antisense transcript (Figure 1F). We generated a construct of mZfp568 that includes the entire 11-ZF DNA binding domain and analyzed its binding to three double-stranded oligonucleotides (oligos): the mouse and chimpanzee Igf2-P0 sequences and an arbitrary negative control that partially overlaps the consensus (Figure 2A). Fluorescence polarization was used to measure the dissociation constants (KD) of the three oligos (Patel et al., 2016aPatel A. Hashimoto H. Zhang X. Cheng X. Characterization of how DNA modifications affect DNA binding by C2H2 zinc finger proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2016; 573: 387-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). ZF1-11 displayed ∼4-fold greater binding affinity for the mouse Igf2 sequence than for the chimp sequence (Figure 2B), which deviates from the mouse sequence at only 3 locations within the 24-bp consensus including a Gua-to-Ade substitution at position 4 (Figure 2A). There is no measureable binding to the negative control (that shares 8/24 bp with the mouse Igf2-P0) (Figure 2A). These results confirm the presumed specificity of ZF1-11 of mZFP568 toward its own Igf2-P0 sequence. As mentioned, in conventional C2H2 ZF proteins, each finger interacts mainly with three adjacent DNA bases (Choo and Klug, 1997Choo Y. Klug A. Physical basis of a protein-DNA recognition code.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, Hashimoto et al., 2017Hashimoto H. Wang D. Horton J.R. Zhang X. Corces V.G. Cheng X.

Pabo C.O. DNA recognition by Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), we estimated that 8 fingers might be sufficient to interact with the 24-bp oligo and thus generated constructs that deleted one or two fingers from either N or C terminus (Figure 2C). Deleting one or two C-terminal fingers caused the affinity for Igf2-P0 to decrease by a factor of ∼4 with ZF1-10 and more than 60-fold with ZF1-9 (Figure 2D), indicating both C-terminal fingers, particularly ZF10, interact favorably with the Igf2-P0 sequence. Similarly, deleting the N-terminal two fingers (ZF3-11) reduced affinity by a factor of ∼10, whereas ZF2-11 had a slightly enhanced affinity (1.5×) than that of ZF1-11 (Figure 2D), indicating that ZF2, but not ZF1, is involved in DNA binding. Therefore, it appears that at least 10 of 11 fingers (ZF2-11) are required for high affinity binding with Igf2-P0 sequence. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which the mZFP568 tandem ZF array recognizes its target DNA sequence, we crystallized ZF1-11 bound with a 28-bp oligo containing the Igf2-P0 sequence in crystallographic space group C2221. The structure was solved to a resolution of 2.09 Å (Table S2). Although ZF1-11 was used for crystallization, the last finger, ZF11, could not be observed in the structure. We thus utilized ZF1-10, which crystallized in a different space group (P1) in complex with a 26-bp oligo, in a resolution of 2.06 Å comparable to that of ZF1-11 (Table S2). In addition, we crystallized the same 28-bp oligo in complex with ZF2-11, which included an ordered ZF11 in the co-crystal structure (Figure S2A). Thus, we observed structural information for the entire 11 fingers by superimposing the structures of ZF1-10 and ZF2-11 (Figure S2B). Pairwise comparison revealed that the three complex structures are highly similar, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of <1 Å when comparing nine to ten common ZFs (Figures S2B and S2E). The fact that we crystallized the ZF array (with or without ZF1 or ZF11) in two space groups with very different crystal packing lattices (Figures S2C and S2D), yet resulted in nearly identical structures (Figure S2E), suggests that crystal packing force does not influence overall protein-DNA conformation. Here, we will describe structural information for fingers 1–10 in the space group C2221 (Figure 2E). As expected, ZF1 is not involved in DNA binding, but instead is involved in intra-molecular interactions bridging between ZF2 and ZF7 (Figure 2E). Deletion of ZF1, which increased DNA binding slightly (Figure 2D), might “relax” ZF2 and ZF7 to a more intimate DNA interacting conformation. Interestingly, ZF1 of ZFP568 is also the least conserved of the 11 fingers in mammals (Figure S1B). In addition, ZF2 and ZF4 are mainly involved in DNA backbone phosphate interactions (Figures 2F and 2G), which leaves eight fingers (ZF3, ZF5–ZF11) for base recognition of the 24-bp consensus motif. Among them, fingers near the ends (ZF3, ZF10, and ZF11) follow the one-finger-three base rule, whereas ZF8 and ZF9 recognize two bases each, ZF6 and ZF7 each span four-bases, and ZF5 together with ZF6 recognize thymines of the opposite strand for a stretch of five A:T bases pairs (Figure 3). The convention that we used for numbering nucleotides and amino acids is that the 24-bp oligo is numbered 1–24 from 5′ (left) to 3′ (right), with the recognition sequence as the “‘top” strand (colored magenta in Figure 3), whereas the protein sequence runs in the opposite direction, from carboxyl (COOH) to amino (NH2) termini. While ZF11 from the structure of ZF2-11 interacts with the 5′ sequence (T1G2G3) (Figure S3A), ZF10 from the structure of ZF1-10 interacts with the following 3-base triplet (G4C5G6), followed by other fingers, and ends with ZF3 interaction the 3′ sequence (G22G23G24) (Figure 3). Within each finger, we use the first zinc-coordinating His in each finger as a reference position 0, residues preceding this, at positions −1, −4, and −7, are potential base-interacting residues typically forming H-bonds with the 5′ base, central base, and 3′ base, respectively, of each DNA triplet (Figure 1A). The most dominant base-specific interaction observed is the Arg-Gua contacts. Eleven G:C base pairs in the Igf2-P0 sequence (11/24) are recognized by nine arginines and two histidine residues, e.g., R654 and H657 of ZF11 (Figure S3A), R632 and R626 of ZF10 (Figures 4A and 4C ), R598 of ZF9 (Figure 4E), R576 of ZF8 (Figure 4G), R542 of ZF7 (Figure 4M), R520 of ZF6 (Figure 4N), and R436, H433, and R430 of ZF3 (Figures 4U–4W). In accordance with apposition of Arg with Gua as the most common mechanism for Gua recognition (Luscombe et al., 2001Luscombe N.M. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M.

Similarly, the Nε2 group of H443 of ZF3 donate one H-bond to guanine N7 and the adjacent ring Cε1 atom donates a C–H…O type of interaction to the O6 atom (Figure 4V) (Horowitz and Trievel, 2012Horowitz S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 41576-41582Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), forming a bidentate H-bond interaction. When R548 of ZF7 encounters an A:T at base pair position 11, the side chain of R548 adopts an alternative conformation and interacts with the DNA phosphate group (Figure 4J). This observation suggests that the hydrogen bonds involving bases are adaptable in the sense that the participating amino acids (Arg in this case) can alter conformation to suit the substrate, a feature that likely contributes to the variability observed at the base pair positions 6 and 11 by the ChIP data (comparing Figure 1D to Figures 4C and 4J). After the Arg-Gua pair, the second most used amino acid-base interaction by mZFP568 is glutamate with pyrimidines, e.g., the E629 of ZF10 interacting with C5 (Figure 4B), the E601 of ZF9 interaction with T7 (Figure 4D), the E573 of ZF8 interacting with C10 (Figure 4H), and the E545 of ZF7 interacting with C12 (Figure 4K). Although all four glutamate residues are located at position −4 of each respective finger, the side chain adopts different conformations to form an H-bond with the cytosine exocyclic amino group N4 (Figure 4B), a van der Waals contact with thymine methyl group (Figure 4D) or van der Waals contacts with the ring carbon C5 atom (Fi"

Dicer proteins are highly conserved dsRNA endoribonucleases with important roles in RNAi and post-transcriptional gene silencing processes (Kim et al., 2009Kim V.N. Han J. Siomi M.C.

Dicer proteins preferentially cleave dsRNA from their termini into small RNAs of distinct size (Zhang et al., 2002Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Brondani V. Billy E. Filipowicz W. Human Dicer preferentially cleaves dsRNAs at their termini without a requirement for ATP.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5875-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The cleavage products are bound by Argonaute (AGO) proteins, which select the guide strand from the small RNA duplexes (Peters and Meister, 2007Peters L. Meister G. Argonaute proteins: mediators of RNA silencing.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). For the strand selection, some AGO proteins show 5′ end nucleotide preference, which is typically a uridine (Mi et al., 2008Mi S. Cai T. Hu Y. Chen Y. Hodges E. Ni F. Wu L. Li S. Zhou H.

Dicer proteins typically contain an N-terminal helicase, DUF283 and a PAZ domain followed by two RNaseIII domains, and a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding domain (dsRBD) (Macrae and Doudna, 2007Macrae I.J.

A three-dimensional view of the molecular machinery of RNA interference.Nature. 2009; 457: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). However, many Dicer proteins lack some of these domains, such as the Dicer found in Giardia intestinalis that contains only the PAZ and RNaseIII domains (Macrae et al., 2006Macrae I.J. Zhou K. Li F. Repic A. Brooks A.N. Cande W.Z. Adams P.D. Doudna J.A. Structural basis for double-stranded RNA processing by Dicer.Science. 2006; 311: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In Paramecium, eight genes encode for Dicer or Dicer-like enzymes. Dicer 1–3 (Dcr1–Dcr3) are canonical Dicer proteins, and it was shown that Dcr1 is responsible for small interfering RNA (siRNA) production. Additionally, the Paramecium genome encodes for five Dicer-like enzymes (Dcl1–Dcl5) (Lepère et al., 2009Lepère G. Nowacki M. Serrano V. Gout J.-F. Guglielmi G. Duharcourt S. Meyer E.

Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These Dicer-like enzymes have similar protein domain architecture to the Dicer of Giardia intestinalis. They contain two RNaseIII domains and a highly diverged PAZ domain, but no helicase or DUF283 domain. Dcl5 also contains a dsRNA-binding domain (RBD) (Figure 1A). The three Dicer-like proteins, namely Dcl2, Dcl3, and Dcl5, produce two classes of small RNAs involved in a developmental genome rearrangement process (Lepère et al., 2009Lepère G. Nowacki M. Serrano V. Gout J.-F. Guglielmi G. Duharcourt S. Meyer E. Silencing-associated and meiosis-specific small RNA pathways in Paramecium tetraurelia.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y.

Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ciliates, such as Paramecium, contain two kinds of nuclei: a somatic macronucleus and a germline micronucleus. The somatic nucleus is highly polyploid (∼800 n), transcriptionally active during the vegetative growth of the cell and does not contain any repetitive sequences such as transposons, transposon remnants or minisatellites. The germline genome is diploid and does contain these repetitive elements. During sexual development, these elements have to be excised either in a precise or imprecise manner from the zygotic nucleus to form a new functional somatic nucleus. Both small RNA classes guide the maternally inherited excision of transposon-derived sequences (internal eliminated sequences [IESs]) (Allen and Nowacki, 2017Allen S.E. Nowacki M. Necessity is the mother of invention: ciliates, transposons, and transgenerational inheritance.Trends Genet. 2017; 33: 197-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Coyne et al., 2012Coyne R.S.

The first class, so-called scan RNAs (scnRNAs), are produced by Dcl2 and Dcl3 in the germline nuclei and are involved in the primary targeting of DNA excision (Lepère et al., 2009Lepère G. Nowacki M. Serrano V. Gout J.-F. Guglielmi G. Duharcourt S. Meyer E. Silencing-associated and meiosis-specific small RNA pathways in Paramecium tetraurelia.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The second class, iesRNAs, are produced in sexual progeny’s developing somatic nuclei from the excised, concatenated IESs and are involved in the amplification of the small RNA signal needed for complete DNA elimination (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev.

Circular concatemers of ultra-short DNA segments produce regulatory RNAs.Cell. 2017; 168: 990-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is important for the small RNAs to target the precise excision of those DNA elements by helping the excision machinery. So far, it is not fully understood how the small RNAs target IESs for excision. The process needs to be highly precise, otherwise most open reading frames would be interrupted and/or frameshifted and the progeny would not be viable, which is what is observed upon depletion of scanRNAs (Lepère et al., 2009Lepère G. Nowacki M. Serrano V. Gout J.-F. Guglielmi G. Duharcourt S. Meyer E. Silencing-associated and meiosis-specific small RNA pathways in Paramecium tetraurelia.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A hallmark of the excised elements is a weak 5′ consensus sequence of TAYAGYNR on both ends, with only one of the TA dinucleotides remaining in the macronuclear genome after elimination (Arnaiz et al., 2012Arnaiz O. Mathy N. Baudry C. Malinsky S. Aury J.-M. Denby Wilkes C. Garnier O. Labadie K. Lauderdale B.E. Le Mouël A. et al.The Paramecium germline genome provides a niche for intragenic parasitic DNA: evolutionary dynamics of internal eliminated sequences.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002984Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For shorter IESs (<30 base pairs [bp]), the consensus is TATAG (Swart et al., 2014Swart E.C. Wilkes C.D. Sandoval P.Y. Arambasic M. Sperling L. Nowacki M. Genome-wide analysis of genetic and epigenetic control of programmed DNA deletion.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 8970-8983Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This size range between 26–30 bp of short IESs includes ∼35% of all IESs, and 93% of all IESs are shorter than 150 bp (Arnaiz et al., 2012Arnaiz O. Mathy N. Baudry C. Malinsky S. Aury J.-M. Denby Wilkes C. Garnier O. Labadie K. Lauderdale B.E. Le Mouël A. et al.The Paramecium germline genome provides a niche for intragenic parasitic DNA: evolutionary dynamics of internal eliminated sequences.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002984Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both classes of small RNAs contain specific 5′ and 3′ signature motifs. It was previously shown by small RNA sequencing that scnRNAs contain a 5′ UNG signature. Additionally, it was suggested that Dcl2 and Dcl3 have redundant functions because only the knock down of both enzymes led to unviable progeny and disappearance of scnRNAs (Lepère et al., 2009Lepère G. Nowacki M. Serrano V. Gout J.-F. Guglielmi G. Duharcourt S. Meyer E. Silencing-associated and meiosis-specific small RNA pathways in Paramecium tetraurelia.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y.

Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, small RNA sequencing after single gene knock downs showed indirectly that Dcl2 and Dcl3 have distinct functions during scnRNA production because DCL3KD shows sRNAs with a size of 25 nt but only a 5′U. DCL2KD, on the other hand, shows sRNAs of varying length but with the 5′UNG signature. In case of iesRNAs, it was shown that they contain a 5′UAG and a 3′ CNAUN signature motif (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested through in vitro assays whether the sequence specificity is a consequence of a specific Dicer cleavage, or as in other organisms, due to selection by Argonaute proteins. Here, we show that Paramecium Dicer-like proteins have sequence specificity for their target dsRNA, which contributes to the efficiency and precision of the DNA elimination machinery. Both developmental classes of small RNAs found in Paramecium contain end signature motifs. To analyze the basis for this sequence specificity and to elucidate the role of the Dicer-like enzymes, we performed in vitro processing assays. We purified recombinant Dcl2 and Dcl5 from insect cells and purified Dcl3-FlagHA-tagged protein directly from Paramecium cell lysates (Figure 1B). The purified proteins were incubated with different dsRNA templates. The processed RNA was 5′ end-labeled and analyzed on 15% denaturing PAGE gels and by deep sequencing. Because we were interested in the sequence preference of the Dicer-like enzymes in an unbiased way, we tested their cleavage activity with a random hairpin RNA substrate. We designed a DNA oligonucleotide containing a T7 promoter sequence on its 5′ end, followed by a stretch of 50 random nucleotides (50xN) and 12 Gs that loop and pair with 12 complementary Cs. We also added five Ts between the G and C stretch. This oligo was extended with the help of a DNA polymerase to form a DNA hairpin containing in its stem the random sequence. This DNA hairpin was used for in vitro transcription, using the T7 promoter, in order to form an RNA hairpin that could be used for the in vitro assays (Figure 1C). We incubated this RNA hairpin with the purified Dicer-like enzymes and analyzed the cleavage products both on acrylamide gels and with deep sequencing. The denaturing gel shows a specific band for Dcl2 around 25 nt. For Dcl3 and Dcl5, we did not observe discrete bands after the cleavage but a smear consisting of a varying range of sizes (Figure 1D). As a second cleavage template, we used a 500 bp long dsRNA fragment corresponding to the coding region of the non-essential ND7 gene, which is involved in a pathway leading to trichocyst discharge (Skouri and Cohen, 1997Skouri F. Cohen J. Genetic approach to regulated exocytosis using functional complementation in Paramecium: identification of the ND7 gene required for membrane fusion.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Incubation of Dcl3 with the ND7 template gives a specific size pattern of cleavage products on the gel and after sequencing (Figure S1F). The same ND7 substrate is processed into 25 nt long sRNAs by Dcl2, as observed for the random templates (Figure S1F). As controls, we used no enzyme samples (−) to visualize the unprocessed input RNA. For Dcl3, which we could not purify from insect cells, we additionally used immunoprecipitation (IP) bead samples incubated with wild-type (WT) lysates as a control (Figure S1F). The WT lysates do not contain the overexpressed Dcl3-FlagHA protein, and thus no protein should bind to the beads during IP. This control was used to assess the background RNA binding to the beads and to ensure that no non-specifically bound protein cleaves the dsRNA input. The hairpin RNA has a size of 175 nt and is therefore not able to migrate into the 15% denaturing gel, thus it is not visible on the gel. Additionally, for Dcl3 we used IP beads incubated without RNA as a control. This control was used to ensure that the cleavage products we detect are not cellular sRNAs already bound to the beads or the immunoprecipitated Dcl3. We do detect some RNA contamination in the beads-only control on the gel (Figure 1D). We think that the background level of RNA bound to the beads shows up after 5′ end labeling when there is no other RNA in the sample. This explanation is supported by the fact that in the beads-only control we see bands that are not present when the IP beads are incubated with template RNA. In order to make sure that this background RNA does not affect our cleavage preference results, we sequenced and analyzed the background RNA as well as our positive samples. The sequencing for Dcl2, Dcl3, and Dcl5 shows different size distributions (Figure 1E). Dcl2, as already seen on the gel, has a distinct size preference for 25 nt. Canonical Dicer proteins generally bind their dsRNA target at the 3′ termini through the PAZ domain recognizing the 2 nt 3′ overhang, while the distance between the PAZ domain and the catalytic center determines the length of the cleavage product. Thus, canonical Dicers act as molecular rulers (Zhang et al., 2004Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Jaskiewicz L. Westhof E. Filipowicz W. Single processing center models for human Dicer and bacterial RNase III.Cell. 2004; 118: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, Macrae et al., 2006Macrae I.J. Zhou K. Li F. Repic A. Brooks A.N. Cande W.Z. Adams P.D. Doudna J.A. Structural basis for double-stranded RNA processing by Dicer.Science. 2006; 311: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2004Ma J.-B. Ye K. Patel D.J. Structural basis for overhang-specific small interfering RNA recognition by the PAZ domain.Nature. 2004; 429: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). However, Dicer proteins with no PAZ domain exist that still produce small RNAs of discrete sizes, such as the Dicer of S. pombe (Provost et al., 2002Provost P. Silverstein R.A. Dishart D. Walfridsson J. Djupedal I. Kniola B. Wright A. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Ekwall K. Dicer is required for chromosome segregation and gene silencing in fission yeast cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 16648-16653Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In order to produce specific 25 nt long small RNAs, it is possible that Paramecium Dcl2 uses a similar mechanism to the Dicer of S. pombe, although structurally it is unclear how this works. Dcl3 and Dcl5, on the other hand, produce small RNAs of varying lengths. The analysis of the cleavage products shows different sequence specificities for Dcl2, Dcl3, and Dcl5. The abundance of each nucleotide at a certain position of the cleavage products was compared to the relative nucleotide abundance in the input RNA. For the random hairpin template, the input abundance is 25% for each nucleotide. This comparison is shown in the enrichment graphs. An enrichment factor of 1 for a specific nucleotide means that this nucleotide is no more abundant than in the input. A factor above 1 means the nucleotide is enriched (i.e., it is found more frequently at this position than would be expected by chance). The enrichment graph for Dcl2 shows a sequence preference for 5′U/AGA (Figure 2A). The same preference is observed in the weblogo analysis (Figure 2C). This 5′U/AGA signature for Dcl2 is not seen in RNA sequencing of DCL3KD cultures in vivo (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which suggests a discrepancy between the Dcl2 cleavage products and the scnRNAs found in vivo, indicating that the Piwi proteins carry out a further selection on the RNAs in the cell. We further analyzed Dcl2 products by removing the passenger strands—identified as having 3′ NNU, assuming that the Piwi protein selects 5′ U—and analyzing the signature of the guide strands. The weblogo of the guide strands shows an even stronger bias toward 5′U (Figure 2C). We then also checked the signature for all the 25 nt reads that start with a U. The weblogo for those reads shows a much stronger 5′U signature (Figure 2C). These findings suggest that Dcl2 has a preference for either 5′UNN or 5′AGA. However, in vivo the Ago protein that binds Dcl2 products selects only the small RNAs starting with U. Therefore, in the small RNA sequencing of RNA extracted from cells, only the 5′U signature is seen. We also analyzed the nucleotide enrichment for the last few positions of the small RNA cleavage products. Dcl2 showed a 3′ UCACC signature, which is also visible in the weblogo of Dcl2 (Figures 2B and 2C). This 3′ UCACC is consistent with its corresponding to the passenger strand of the proposed 5′ UNN or 5′ AGA sequence preference of Dcl2, as Dicer products are double-stranded with a 2 nt 3′ overhang. The predicted complement of 5′ UNN is 3′ NNANN, including the 2 nt 3′ overhang, and the complement of 5′ AGA is 3′ UCUNN. Together, a mix of these two populations would appear as 3′ UCA/UNN on an enrichment graph or weblogo, which is what we observe, bar the 3′ most CC (Figures 2B and 2C). Strictly speaking, we cannot rule out Dcl2 having a 3′ sequence preference rather than a 5′ preference and the 5′ UNN or 5′ AGA coming from the complementary strand. Indeed, it is possible that Dcl2 recognizes both the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the RNA it is to cleave. If this is the case, it would explain the apparent dual specificity of the enzyme: if Dcl2 preferentially cleaves 5′ U and 3′UCUNN, then we would expect to see the enrichments found. In order to see whether the 5′ AGA could correspond to the complementary strand of a cleavage event where 5′ U and 3′ UCUNN were both selected for, we analyzed the weblogo of the RNAs that do contain 5′ AGA (Figure 2C). These RNAs have a preference for A at 3 nt from their 3′ end, which demonstrates that the 5′ A and the 3′ UCUNN are present on the same strand of RNA. This indicates that Dcl2 preferentially cleaves RNAs with 5′ U and 3′ UCUNN, as shown at the bottom of Figure 2C. Whether this preference results from a dual 5′ (or indeed 3′) specificity of the enzyme and the result of enzyme dimerization, or from both a 5′ and 3′ preference for the same strand, cannot be determined from this data. The enrichment graph for Dcl3 shows a nucleotide preference of 5′UNG, which is also present in the weblogo (Figures 2D and 2F). The 5′UNG signature is even more dominant when we analyze the guide strand only. Moreover, the weblogo and the nucleotide enrichment for the last positions showed a 3′ C/NNANN motif (Figure 2E). Similarly to Dcl2, the enriched A is the expected complementary nucleotide to the 5′ U as shown in the schematic representation of the Dcl3 cleavage product (Figure 2F). The C is slightly enriched on the fifth last position. This C corresponds to the 5′ G on the third position of the passenger strand (Figure 2E). Analysis of the beads-only control showed that the GC content of the reads is ∼50%, which is much higher than the GC content found in the Paramecium genome (GC 30%). Furthermore, only ∼50% of the IP bead reads mapped to the Paramecium genome (Figure S1A). The high GC content suggests that the non-mapping background mostly comes from bacterial contamination from the food of Paramecium. We analyzed the 25 nt and 27 nt reads in more detail and checked how many Paramecium-mapping background reads are found in our NNN hairpin cleavage reads for Dcl3 (Figures S1B and S1C). In other words, we analyzed how many reads in our sequencing results were actually not real Dicer products but background sRNAs from the beads, to ensure that the background does not affect our results. Of the 21,011 25 nt long reads from the IP beads mapping to the genome, only 93 reads were also found in the 25 nt long reads from the NNN hairpin sequencing. This is only 0.078% of the total 25 nt reads of the NNN hairpin reads. For the 27 nt long reads, only 0.07% of our NNN hairpin reads are background coming from the beads. We also analyzed whether the 25 nt reads from the IP beads mapping to the genome are scanRNAs. We checked the weblogo of the mapping reads (Figure S1D). The logo did not show the specific 5′UNG signature known for scnRNAs, which supports our finding that the background does not affect our cleavage preference results for Dcl3. Nevertheless, we extracted the background reads from our NNN reads and performed the weblogo analysis again to check if the logo changes. As expected, the weblogo still showed a 5′ UNG signature for Dcl3 after background extraction (Figure S1E). These findings suggest that there is some RNA contamination bound to the beads, which is visible on the gel, but this background RNA does not affect the results of the cleavage preferences of Dcl3. Dcl5 seems to cleave the hairpin RNA less efficiently than Dcl2 or Dcl3, as can be seen on the gel and in the sequencing size distribution (Figures 1D and 1E). Nonetheless, analysis of the sequencing shows specific nucleotide preferences for Dcl5. The enrichment graph and the weblogo show a 5′UAG preference and a 3′ CUAU/CN (Figures 2G–2I). These 5′ and 3′ motifs are also seen in sRNA sequencing from total RNA extracts of the cell (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ sequence cleavage preferences for Dcl5 are palindromic and could result from guide and passenger strands of the same cleaved duplex, as is shown by the complementary 5′ UAG and 3′ CUAU/CN, including a 3′ dinucleotide overhang. Thus, it is not possible to separate guide and passenger strands from each other to assess whether Dcl5 has a 3′ sequence preference as well as a 5′ cleavage preference, or whether the 3′ signature comes from the passenger strands. However, in the cellular small RNA sequencing (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) the same 5′ UAG and 3′ CUAU/CN are evident in the Dcl5 products, indicating that either the 3′ signature is a real feature of Dcl5 cleavage, or there is no guide/passenger strand selection and that all Dcl5 products are loaded onto Piwi proteins. Because Dcl5 in vivo cleaves dsRNA templates composed of concatenated IESs (Allen et al., 2017Allen S.E. Hug I. Pabian S. Rzeszutek I. Hoehener C. Nowacki M. Circular concatemers of ultra-short DNA segments produce regulatory RNAs.Cell. 2017; 168: 990-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate its cleavage preferences on Paramecium sequences. We therefore performed in vitro assays for Dcl5 with several dsRNA templates (Figure 3A). We tested a 500 bp long dsRNA fragment of ND7 representing genomic DNA as well as dsRNA templates consisting of IESs. One template contained three different IESs, each 27 nt in length, joined together. IESs are mostly short sequences with a length mode of 27/28 bp (Arnaiz et al., 2012Arnaiz O. Mathy N. Baudry C. Malinsky S. Aury J.-M. Denby Wilkes C. Garnier O. Labadie K. Lauderdale B.E. Le Mouël A. et al.The Paramecium germline genome provides a niche for intragenic parasitic DNA: evolutionary dynamics of internal eliminated sequences.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002984Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), therefore we chose the IES length in the concatemer to be 27 nt. This template was called ‘Concatemer’. Another template was derived from the same three IESs but their length was extended by adding 8 nt in the middle of each IES sequence resulting in 35 nt long IESs. This template is referred to as ‘Concatemer Longer’. The no enzyme controls (−) show the unprocessed RNA, which is visible for the two IES templates. The ND7 RNA is too large to migrate into the gel same as the hairpin NNN template. Dcl5 processes the Concatemer template into 27 nt products. The “Concatemer Longer” is cleaved into 35 nt dsRNAs, which were detected as a strong band on the gel. There is also a weaker 27 nt long band visible (Figure 3B). The size of the cleavage products reflects precisely the length of the IES sequences. These findings indicate that Dcl5 recognizes the IESs as discrete units. The ND7 fragment, similar to the NNN hairpin, does not get processed into products of distinct sizes (Figure 3B). We therefore postulate that Dcl5 has an ability to recognize and cleave IES ends. The size distribution observed on the gel for the “Concatemer” and “Concatemer Longer” templates is also found in the deep sequencing results, although some bands visible on the gel were not present in the sequencing data (Figure 3C). The discrepancy between what is seen on the gel and the corresponding sequencing data is not clear but it might come from RNAs that cannot be cloned during Illumina library preparation but can be 5′ end-labeled. We suggest that the additional products are cleaved off the ends of dsRNA templates RNAs when the Dicer-like protein recognizes the internal IES sequences. These leftovers are not true Dicer cleavage products (processed on both ends) and therefore do not contain 5′monophosphate required for adaptor ligation during library preparation. Both ends of the templates have 5′ triphosphates due to the T7 RNA synthesis and 3′OH. During library preparation, only one adaptor would be ligated to the 3′OH ends of those products that would lead to their absence in the sequencing libraries. This, however, would not affect the 5′ end labeli"

Work on Drosophila has shown that opsins, the protein moieties of visual photopigments, not only detect light (Leung and Montell, 2017Leung N.Y. Montell C. Unconventional roles of opsins.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33: 241-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Opsins were implicated in larval temperature preference behaviors (Shen et al., 2011Shen W.L. Kwon Y. Adegbola A.A.

Accordingly, opsins were surmised to have light-independent ancestral functions (Shen et al., 2011Shen W.L. Kwon Y. Adegbola A.A. Luo J. Chess A. Montell C. Function of rhodopsin in temperature discrimination in Drosophila.Science. 2011; 331: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Senthilan et al., 2012Senthilan P.R. Piepenbrock D.

In thermosensation, opsins, though usually thermo-stable, were proposed to act as thermosensors (Shen et al., 2011Shen W.L. Kwon Y. Adegbola A.A. Luo J. Chess A. Montell C. Function of rhodopsin in temperature discrimination in Drosophila.Science. 2011; 331: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Leung and Montell, 2017Leung N.Y. Montell C. Unconventional roles of opsins.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33: 241-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Locomotion is a hallmark of animal life, and the need for movement control presumably was a driving factor in early nervous system evolution (Jékely et al., 2015Jékely G. Keijzer F. Godfrey-Smith P. An option space for early neural evolution.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2015; 370: 20150181Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Key components in locomotion control are proprioceptors that inform the nervous system about locomotory body movements (Büschges and Manira, 1998Büschges A. Manira A.E. Sensory pathways and their modulation in the control of locomotion.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A priori, we could not expect that proprioceptors would require visual opsins, but when we analyzed locomotion in Drosophila larvae, this is what we found. To assay locomotion, we recorded late third-instar wandering larvae crawling singly in transparent arenas. Because visual input can influence locomotion (Busto et al., 1999Busto M. Iyengar B. Campos A.R. Genetic dissection of behavior: modulation of locomotion by light in the Drosophila melanogaster larva requires genetically distinct visual system functions.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3337-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all experiments were carried out under infrared illumination that does not activate Drosophila opsins (Salcedo et al., 1999Salcedo E. Huber A. Henrich S. Chadwell L.V. Chou W.H. Paulsen R. Britt S.G. Blue- and green-absorbing visual pigments of Drosophila: ectopic expression and physiological characterization of the R8 photoreceptor cell-specific Rh5 and Rh6 rhodopsins.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10716-10726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Ni et al., 2017Ni J.D. Baik L.S. Holmes T.C. Montell C. A rhodopsin in the brain functions in circadian photoentrainment in Drosophila.Nature. 2017; 545: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding this exclusion of visual effects, ninaE17 null mutant larvae lacking the major visual opsin NINAE (also known as Rh1) displayed defective locomotion (Figure 1A; see also Movie S1). Compared to wild-type larvae, ninaE17 mutants crawled slower and turned more frequently, requiring more time to travel by one body length and covering shorter distances between consecutive turns (Figures 1B and S1A). Equivalent locomotion defects ensued when the ninaE17 mutation was uncovered with the deficiency Df(3R)BSC636, whereas normal locomotion was restored when we introduced a genomic ninaE rescue construct, P{ninaE+}, into the ninaE17 mutant background (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A; Movie S1). The requirement of NINAE for locomotion cannot reflect visual ninaE function; NINAE, the major visual opins of adult flies, is absent from larval photoreceptors, which instead use the minor opsins Rh5 or Rh6 (Sprecher et al., 2007Sprecher S.G. Pichaud F. Desplan C. Adult and larval photoreceptors use different mechanisms to specify the same Rhodopsin fates.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2182-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether larval crawling might also depend on other opsins, we randomly selected Rh61 null mutants lacking the Rh6 opsin, revealing locomotion phenotypes as seen in ninaE17 mutants (Figures 1B and S1A). Locomotion defects were also seen when the Rh61 mutation was uncovered with the deficiency Df(3R)Exel6174, and introducing a genomic Rh6 rescue construct, P{Rh6+}, in the Rh61 mutant background restored normal locomotion (Figures 1B and S1A). Impaired locomotion in ninaE17 mutants was associated with altered locomotory body movements. Compared to controls, the mutant larvae pushed forward their bodies with diminished contraction amplitudes (Figures 1C and S1B). These movement defects were largely ameliorated in ninaE17, P{ninaE+} rescue larvae, and contraction defects were also seen in Rh61 mutants where they were rescued fully by the rescue construct P{Rh6+} (Figures 1C and S1B). Locomotion defects as seen in ninaE17 and Rh61 mutants reportedly characterize mutant larvae with impaired chordotonal organs (Caldwell et al., 2003Caldwell J.C. Miller M.M. Wing S. Soll D.R. Eberl D.F. Dynamic analysis of larval locomotion in Drosophila chordotonal organ mutants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 16053-16058Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Chordotonal organs are internal stretch receptors that are serially arranged along the insect body. Besides monitoring substrate vibrations, chordotonal organs primarily function as proprioceptors controlling locomotion (Field and Matheson, 1998Field L.H. Matheson T. Chordotonal organs of insects.Adv. Insect Physiol. 1998; 27: 1-228Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We assayed locomotion in nanchung (nan) and inactive (iav) ion channel mutants with silenced chordotonal organs (Zhang et al., 2013Zhang W. Yan Z. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Sound response mediated by the TRP channels NOMPC, NANCHUNG, and INACTIVE in chordotonal organs of Drosophila larvae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), revealing pronounced locomotion and contraction defects resembling qualitatively those of ninaE17 and Rh61 mutants (Figures 1B, 1C, S1A, and SB). To test whether chordotonal organs might express opsins, we used Rh6-Gal4 and ninaE-Gal4 promoter/enhancer fusions to drive a hexameric UAS-6xGFP green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. ninaE-Gal4 and Rh6-Gal4 both induced faint GFP signals in the lateral chordotonal (lch5) organs that are serially arranged along the larval abdomen (Figures 2A and S2A). Lch5 organs each comprise supporting cells and five monodendritic proprioceptor neurons. Labeling neurons with anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody located the GFP signals to the latter proprioceptors (Figures 2A and S2A). Additional evidence for the presence of opsins in lch5 proprioceptors was obtained when we labeled the larval abdomen with antibodies against NINAE or Rh6. Both anti-NINAE and anti-Rh6 selectively labeled the sensory dendrites of all lch5 receptors in wild-type larvae but not in the respective null mutants (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2B). Chordotonal receptor dendrites use cilia as outer segments, with each cilium being surrounded by an endolymph space (Field and Matheson, 1998Field L.H. Matheson T. Chordotonal organs of insects.Adv. Insect Physiol. 1998; 27: 1-228Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Anti-HRP recognizes sugar residues of glycoproteins that are transported up into these cilia where they are secreted in two bands into that space (Jan et al., 1985Jan Y.N. Ghysen A. Christoph I. Barbel S. Jan L.Y. Formation of neuronal pathways in the imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first HRP band demarks the junction between the dendritic inner segment and the cilium. Both anti-NINAE and anti-Rh6 selectively labeled the dendritic inner segment, up to this first HRP band (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2B). Within the dendritic inner segment, anti-Rh6 staining was confined to the most distal region, whereas anti-NINAE staining extended further down the segment (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2B), indicating partly different localizations for the two opsin proteins. Chordotonal receptor cilia transduce mechanical stimuli that are conveyed to them by supporting cap cells (Field and Matheson, 1998Field L.H. Matheson T. Chordotonal organs of insects.Adv. Insect Physiol. 1998; 27: 1-228Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To test whether opsins contribute to chordotonal receptor function, we recorded compound action currents from lch5 receptor axons while displacing the cap cells with 20 Hz sinusoids (Figure 3A). Consistent with previous observations (Zhang et al., 2013Zhang W. Yan Z. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Sound response mediated by the TRP channels NOMPC, NANCHUNG, and INACTIVE in chordotonal organs of Drosophila larvae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), wild-type lch5 receptors spiked spontaneously and increased their spike rate during cap cell actuation (Figures 3B and 3C). Spontaneous spiking was preserved in ninaE17 and also Rh61 mutants (Figures 3B and 3D), yet the spike rate hardly increased in response to mechanical stimulation (Figures 3B and 3C). This reduced responsiveness was seen across a wide range of stimulus displacements (Figure 3C), including large stimuli evoking saturated spiking (Figure 3E). Virtually normal spiking responses were restored in both ninaE17, P{ninaE+} and Rh61, P{Rh6+} rescue larvae (Figures 3B, 3C, and 3E), documenting that the mechanosensory function of the proprioceptors depends on opsins. Mechanotransduction by lch5 receptors involves the ciliary transient receptor potential (TRP) channels NOMPC, Nanchung (Nan), and Inactive (Iav) (Zhang et al., 2013Zhang W. Yan Z. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Sound response mediated by the TRP channels NOMPC, NANCHUNG, and INACTIVE in chordotonal organs of Drosophila larvae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NOMPC mechanotransduction channels (Yan et al., 2013Yan Z. Zhang W. He Y. Gorczyca D. Xiang Y. Cheng L.E. Meltzer S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Drosophila NOMPC is a mechanotransduction channel subunit for gentle-touch sensation.Nature. 2013; 493: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) localize distally of the second HRP band to the tip of the cilium (Cheng et al., 2010Cheng L.E.

The role of the TRP channel NompC in Drosophila larval and adult locomotion.Neuron. 2010; 67: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas Nan and Iav form heteromeric channels in the proximal cilium region, between the two HRP bands (Gong et al., 2004Gong Z. Son W. Chung Y.D. Kim J. Shin D.W. McClung C.A. Lee Y. Lee H.W. Chang D.J. Kaang B.K. et al.Two interdependent TRPV channel subunits, inactive and Nanchung, mediate hearing in Drosophila.J.

Braun F.J. et al.TRP channels in insect stretch receptors as insecticide targets.Neuron. 2015; 86: 665-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). We co-stained lch5 receptors with antibodies against NOMPC and Iav and found that the ciliary localization of these channels depends on opsins. Wild-type lch5 cilia showed normal NOMPC and Iav localizations, with Iav occurring proximally to NOMPC (Figures 4A and S3). In ninaE17 mutants, however, NOMPC leaked into the endolymph space from about half of the cilia, whereby some of the affected cilia lacked Iav protein (Figures 4B and 4D). Ciliary leakage of NOMPC, and an associated loss of Iav, was also seen when we selectively knocked down ninaE in chordotonal receptors by expressing a UAS-ninaE-RNAi construct with the chordotonal receptor driver dnai2-Gal4 (Karak et al., 2015Karak S. Jacobs J.S. Kittelmann M. Spalthoff C. Katana R. Sivan-Loukianova E. Schon M.A. Kernan M.J. Eberl D.F. Göpfert M.C. Diverse roles of axonemal dyneins in Drosophila auditory neuron function and mechanical amplification in hearing.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 17085Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Figures 4C and 4D). Control larvae expressing either ninaE-RNAi or dnai2-Gal4 alone showed largely normal TRP channel localizations, and, in ninaE17 mutants, the ciliary defects were attenuated by the rescue construct P{ninaE+} (Figures 4C and 4D). NOMPC leakage and loss of IAV also characterized the lch5 receptors of Rh61 mutants, where the rescue construct P{Rh6+} restored partially cilium integrity (Figures 4C and 4D). Defects in cell integrity were also seen when we inspected lch5 receptor dendrites in ninaE17 mutants with transmission electron microscopy (Figures 4E–4G). Besides seemingly intact dendrites (Figures 4E and 4F), we observed profound structural aberrations in the mutants, including cilium bending (Figure 4G, left), signs of cilium blebbing and disorganization (Figure 4G, middle), and entire cilium loss with cell material invading the endolymph space, including the electron-dense material that normally resides in a dilation of the cilium (Figure 4G, right). That locomotion requires feedback from chordotonal receptors was confirmed when we selectively ablated these receptors by expressing UAS-hid, rpr with the chordotonal receptor driver Dhc93AB-Gal4 (Senthilan et al., 2012Senthilan P.R. Piepenbrock D. Ovezmyradov G. Nadrowski B. Bechstedt S. Pauls S. Winkler M. Möbius W. Howard J. Göpfert M.C. Drosophila auditory organ genes and genetic hearing defects.Cell. 2012; 150: 1042-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Successful ablation was reported by anti-HRP staining (Figure S4G), and locomotion was found to be impaired (Figure S4A). Locomotion defects, though less pronounced, also ensued when we used RNAi to selectively knock down ninaE in chordotonal receptors (Figure S4B), documenting that these proprioceptors render locomotion dependent on opsin. Locomotion defects in ninaE17, Rh61 double mutants resembled those of the single mutants (Figure S4C), indicating that NINAE and Rh6 operate in the same pathway, with both being essential for normal locomotion. To evaluate whether the opsin-bound retinal chromophore might also be required for larval crawling, we analyzed locomotion santa-maria1 mutants that fail to synthesize the chromophore (Wang et al., 2007Wang T. Jiao Y. Montell C. Dissection of the pathway required for generation of vitamin A and for Drosophila phototransduction.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). santa-maria1 mutants showed locomotion defects resembling those of ninaE17 and Rh61 mutants (Figure S4D), indicating that proprioceptive opsin functions might involve the chromophore. The opsin dependence of larval temperature preferences had been linked to neurons that express the TRPA1 channel (Shen et al., 2011Shen W.L. Kwon Y. Adegbola A.A. Luo J. Chess A. Montell C. Function of rhodopsin in temperature discrimination in Drosophila.Science. 2011; 331: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Sokabe et al., 2016Sokabe T. Chen H.C. Luo J. Montell C. A switch in thermal preference in Drosophila larvae depends on multiple Rhodopsins.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 336-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This channel, however, is reportedly absent from chordotonal receptors (Rosenzweig et al., 2005Rosenzweig M. Brennan K.M. Tayler T.D. Phelps P.O. Patapoutian A. Garrity P.A. The Drosophila ortholog of vertebrate TRPA1 regulates thermotaxis.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and locomotion remained largely uncompromised when we ablated TRPA1-positive neurons by driving UAS-hid, rpr with trpA1-Gal4 (Figure S4E). To further test whether thermosensory opsin functions might affect locomotion, we assayed larval crawling at an elevated temperature of 29°C, where larval temperature behavior is no more opsin dependent (Shen et al., 2011Shen W.L. Kwon Y. Adegbola A.A. Luo J. Chess A. Montell C. Function of rhodopsin in temperature discrimination in Drosophila.Science. 2011; 331: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Sokabe et al., 2016Sokabe T. Chen H.C. Luo J. Montell C. A switch in thermal preference in Drosophila larvae depends on multiple Rhodopsins.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 336-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding this exclusion of thermosensory opsin effects, ninaE17 and Rh61 mutants displayed defective locomotion (Figure S4F), documenting that the proprioceptive functions of opsins are independent of their thermosensory roles. Apart from photoreceptors, chordotonal proprioceptors seem to be the first animal cells whose structure and function both depend on opsins. The Drosophila larval body wall also harbors light-sensitive cells (Xiang et al., 2010Xiang Y. Yuan Q. Vogt N. Looger L.L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Light-avoidance-mediating photoreceptors tile the Drosophila larval body wall.Nature. 2010; 468: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), yet chordotonal receptor function seems light independent (Scholz et al., 2017Scholz N. Guan C. Nieberler M. Grotemeyer A. Maiellaro I. Gao S. Beck S. Pawlak M. Sauer M. Asan E. et al.Mechano-dependent signaling by Latrophilin/CIRL quenches cAMP in proprioceptive neurons.eLife. 2017; 6: e28360Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the latter cells detect light without opsins (Xiang et al., 2010Xiang Y. Yuan Q. Vogt N. Looger L.L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Light-avoidance-mediating photoreceptors tile the Drosophila larval body wall.Nature. 2010; 468: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Because all Drosophila opsins are non-ciliary, rhabdomeric r-opsins (Shichida and Matsuyama, 2009Shichida Y. Matsuyama T. Evolution of opsins and phototransduction.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 2881-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), their presence in ciliated cells is unexpected. The co-requirements of NINAE and Rh6 seem likewise remarkable; first, these two opsins associate with different photoreceptor types (Sprecher et al., 2007Sprecher S.G. Pichaud F. Desplan C. Adult and larval photoreceptors use different mechanisms to specify the same Rhodopsin fates.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2182-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and, second, even further opsins seem present in lch5 proprioceptors—judged from an intragenic Gal4 insertion they also express the opsin Rh7 (Figure S2C). The ciliary leakage of NOMPC and ultrastructural defects implicate opsins in sensory dendrite organization, presumably contributing to dendrite maintenance as some dendritic cilia seem unaffected, whereas others also lack the Iav protein and structurally deteriorate or disappear. Such contribution of opsins to dendrite maintenance does not exclude a sensor function as known from vision and proposed for thermosensation (Shen et al., 2011Shen W.L. Kwon Y. Adegbola A.A. Luo J. Chess A. Montell C. Function of rhodopsin in temperature discrimination in Drosophila.Science. 2011; 331: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For lch5 receptors, however, a sensor seems rather unlikely for two reasons. First, cap cell actuation can elicit lch5 receptor spiking within only 2 ms (Figure S4H), leaving no time for an indirect transduction involving upstream sensors and second messenger cascades (Christensen and Corey, 2007Christensen A.P. Corey D.P. TRP channels in mechanosensation: direct or indirect activation?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 510-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Second, mechanotransduction in lch5 receptors takes place in the cilia, but NINAE and Rh6 localize beneath the cilia to the dendritic inner segments. The latter segments harbor the ciliary rootlets, which support the cilia structurally and are essential for cilium maintenance (Yang et al., 2005Yang J. Gao J. Adamian M. Wen X.H. Pawlyk B. Zhang L. Sanderson M.J. Zuo J. Makino C.L. Li T. The ciliary rootlet maintains long-term stability of sensory cilia.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4129-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Evolutionarily, it now seems that fly hearing has taken over its opsin dependence from proprioception given that insect hearing organs have differentiated locally from the serial set of proprioceptive chordotonal organs (Göpfert and Hennig, 2016Göpfert M.C. Hennig R.M. Hearing in Insects.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2016; 61: 257-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The respective proprioceptors appear to be serial sibling cells of insect photoreceptors (Niwa et al., 2004Niwa N. Hiromi Y. Okabe M. A conserved developmental program for sensory organ formation in Drosophila melanogaster.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that their common ancestor cells already used opsins, presumably in the context of dendrite maintenance as also the maintenance of photoreceptor rhabdomeres involves structural roles of opsins (Ahmad et al., 2007Ahmad S.T. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. O’Tousa J.E. The Drosophila rhodopsin cytoplasmic tail domain is required for maintenance of rhabdomere structure.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, Shieh, 2011Shieh B.H. Molecular genetics of retinal degeneration: A Drosophila perspective.Fly (Austin). 2011; 5: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Rhabdomeric r-opsins, as found in Drosophila, presumably split from ciliary c-opsins before the appearance of bilaterians (Feuda et al., 2012Feuda R. Hamilton S.C. McInerney J.O. Pisani D.

Deep Homology: Uncanny Similarities of Humans and Flies Uncovered by Evo-devo.

The dendritic localization of NINAE beneath chordotonal receptor cilia might reflect this evolutionary transition, suggesting that structural roles of r-opsins in sensory dendrites preceded their use for light detection. How exactly opsins contribute to dendrite structure is unclear. Possibly, they help shaping dendritic membrane composition given that opsins reportedly translocate phospholipids between the two membrane leaflets (Menon et al., 2011Menon I. Huber T. Sanyal S.

Judged from Drosophila photo- and chordotonal receptors, it appears that structural r-opsin functions might have been preserved during the sensory receptor cell type evolution, which could explain why diverse sensory modalities depend on opsins.

https://openalex.org/W2790084139,"Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are increasingly incorporated into a variety of commercial applications and consumer products; however, ENMs may possess cytotoxic properties due to their small size. This study assessed the effects of two commonly used ENMs, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A collection of ≈4600 S. cerevisiae deletion mutant strains was used to deduce the genes, whose absence makes S. cerevisiae more prone to the cytotoxic effects of ZnONPs or AgNPs. We demonstrate that S. cerevisiae strains that lack genes involved in transmembrane and membrane transport, cellular ion homeostasis, and cell wall organization or biogenesis exhibited the highest sensitivity to ZnONPs. In contrast, strains that lack genes involved in transcription and RNA processing, cellular respiration, and endocytosis and vesicular transport exhibited the highest sensitivity to AgNPs. Secondary assays confirmed that ZnONPs affected cell wall function and integrity, whereas AgNPs exposure decreased transcription, reduced endocytosis, and led to a dysfunctional electron transport system. This study supports the use of S. cerevisiae Gene Deletion Array as an effective high-throughput technique to determine cellular targets of ENM toxicity."

This study aimed to analyze and compare the functional outcomes of patients treated for quadriceps tendon ruptures using suture anchors or transosseous sutures. Patients having undergone suture anchor repair or transosseous suture repair for quadriceps tendon rupture between 2010 and 2015 at one of the two participating hospitals were included. Patients from site A underwent TS repair (TS group) while patients from site B underwent SA repair (SA group). Exclusion criteria included previous or concomitant injuries of the involved knee, penetrating injuries and pre-existing neurological conditions. Clinical outcome was assessed by subjective scores (Lysholm and Tegner Scores, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain), quadriceps isokinetic strength testing, Insall-Salvati Index (ISI), and physical examination. Non-parametrical statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test. Twenty-seven patients were included in the study of which 17 patients (63%) were available for follow-up (SA group: 9, TS group: 8). All patients were male with a mean age of 62.7 (SD: 8.8) and 57.9 (SD: 12.7) years for the SA group and TS group, respectively. The groups did not differ in terms of demographic characteristics. No clinically significant differences were identified between the two groups. There were no re-ruptures in either group. Treatment of quadriceps tendon rupture using suture anchors provides a clinically valid alternative treatment to the gold-standard transosseous suture repair."
https://openalex.org/W2793802940,"Conjugative transposition drives the emergence of multidrug resistance in diverse bacterial pathogens, yet the mechanisms are poorly characterized. The Tn1549 conjugative transposon propagates resistance to the antibiotic vancomycin used for severe drug-resistant infections. Here, we present four high-resolution structures of the conserved Y-transposase of Tn1549 complexed with circular transposon DNA intermediates. The structures reveal individual transposition steps and explain how specific DNA distortion and cleavage mechanisms enable DNA strand exchange with an absolute minimum homology requirement. This appears to uniquely allow Tn916-like conjugative transposons to bypass DNA homology and insert into diverse genomic sites, expanding gene transfer. We further uncover a structural regulatory mechanism that prevents premature cleavage of the transposon DNA before a suitable target DNA is found and generate a peptide antagonist that interferes with the transposase-DNA structure to block transposition. Our results reveal mechanistic principles of conjugative transposition that could help control the spread of antibiotic resistance genes."

Here, we present the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of α-amanitin bound to and inhibited by its natural target, the mammalian Pol II elongation complex. The structure revealed that the toxin is located in a pocket previously identified in yeast Pol II but forms additional contacts with metazoan-specific residues, which explains why its affinity to mammalian Pol II is ∼3000 times higher than for yeast Pol II. Our work provides the structural basis for the inhibition of mammalian Pol II by the natural toxin α-amanitin and highlights that cryo-EM is well suited to studying interactions of a small molecule with its macromolecular target.

https://openalex.org/W2793989315,"The IL-1 cytokine family includes eleven members, among which Il-36α, β and γ, IL-36Ra and IL-38. The IL-36 cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-38 is also expressed in the skin and was previously proposed to act as an IL-36 antagonist. In this study, we thus examined expression and function of Il-38 in a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin inflammation. Il-38 mRNA was detected in the epidermis and in primary mouse keratinocytes, but not in dermal fibroblasts. At the peak of IMQ-induced inflammation, skin Il-38 mRNA levels were reduced, whereas Il-36ra mRNA expression increased. The severity of IMQ-induced skin inflammation, as assessed by recording ear thickness and histological changes, was similar in Il-38 KO and WT littermate control mice, while, in contrast, Il-36ra-deficient mice displayed more severe skin pathology than their WT littermates. Il-38-deficiency had no impact on IMQ-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators in the skin in vivo, on the basal expression of various cytokines or chemokines by cultured primary keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts in vitro, or on the response of these cells to Il-36β. Finally, after cessation of topical IMQ application, the resolution of skin inflammation was also not altered in Il-38 KO mice. In conclusion, Il-38-deficiency did not impact the development or resolution of IMQ-induced skin inflammation. Our observations further suggest that endogenous Il-38 does not exert Il-36 inhibitory activity in this model, or in cultured skin cells. A potential anti-inflammatory function of Il-38 in mouse skin thus still remains to be demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2790058915,"Active forgetting explains the intrinsic instability of a labile memory lasting for hours. However, how such memory maintains stability against unwanted disruption is not completely understood. Here, we report a learning-activated active protection mechanism that enables labile memory to resist disruptive sensory experiences in Drosophila. Aversive olfactory conditioning activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) transiently in the mushroom-body γ lobe, where labile-aversive memory is stored. This increased MAPK activity significantly prolongs labile memory retention and enhances its resistance to disruption induced by heat shock, electric shock, or odor reactivation. Such experience-induced forgetting cannot be prevented by inhibition of Rac1 activity. Instead, protection of Rac1-independent forgetting correlates with non-muscle myosin II activity and persistence of learning-induced presynaptic structural changes. Increased Raf/MAPK activity, together with suppressed Rac1 activity, completely blocks labile memory decay. Thus, learning not only leads to memory formation, but also activates active protection and active forgetting to regulate the formed memory."
https://openalex.org/W2792919360,"Vision impairment from corneal fibrosis is a common consequence of irregular corneal wound healing after injury. Intermediate-conductance calmodulin/calcium-activated K+ channels 3.1 (KCa3.1) play an important role in cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. Proliferation and differentiation of corneal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts can lead to corneal fibrosis after injury. KCa3.1 has been shown in many non-ocular tissues to promote fibrosis, but its role in corneal fibrosis is still unknown. In this study, we characterized the expression KCa3.1 in the human cornea and its role in corneal wound healing in vivo using a KCa3.1 knockout (KCa3.1-/-) mouse model. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that blockade of KCa3.1 by a selective KCa3.1 inhibitor, TRAM-34, could augment a novel interventional approach for controlling corneal fibrosis in our established in vitro model of corneal fibrosis. The expression of KCa3.1 gene and protein was analyzed in human and murine corneas. Primary human corneal fibroblast (HCF) cultures were used to examine the potential of TRAM-34 in treating corneal fibrosis by measuring levels of pro-fibrotic genes, proteins, and cellular migration using real-time quantitative qPCR, Western blotting, and scratch assay, respectively. Cytotoxicity of TRAM-34 was tested with trypan blue assay, and pro-fibrotic marker expression was tested in KCa3.1-/-. Expression of KCa3.1 mRNA and protein was detected in all three layers of the human cornea. The KCa3.1-/- mice demonstrated significantly reduced corneal fibrosis and expression of pro-fibrotic marker genes such as collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), suggesting that KCa3.1 plays an important role corneal wound healing in vivo. Pharmacological treatment with TRAM-34 significantly attenuated corneal fibrosis in vitro, as demonstrated in HCFs by the inhibition TGFβ-mediated transcription of pro-fibrotic collagen I mRNA and α-SMA mRNA and protein expression (p<0.001). No evidence of cytotoxicity was observed. Our study suggests that KCa3.1 regulates corneal wound healing and that blockade of KCa3.1 by TRAM-34 offers a potential therapeutic strategy for developing therapies to cure corneal fibrosis in vivo."

The complete deletion (CD) mouse model mimics the most common deletion found in WBS patients and recapitulates most neurologic features of the disorder along with some cardiovascular manifestations leading to significant cardiac hypertrophy with increased cardiomyocytes’ size. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin found in green tea, has been associated with potential health benefits, both on cognition and cardiovascular phenotypes, through several mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of green tea extracts on WBS-related phenotypes through a phase I clinical trial in mice. After feeding CD animals with green tea extracts dissolved in the drinking water, starting at three different time periods (prenatal, youth and adulthood), a set of behavioral tests and several anatomical, histological and molecular analyses were performed. Treatment resulted to be effective in the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and was also able to ameliorate short-term memory deficits of CD mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EGCG might have a therapeutic and/or preventive role in the management of WBS."
https://openalex.org/W2791912612,"Background Antenatal depression is associated with adverse maternal and infant well-being. However, compared to postpartum depression, it has been less frequently explored globally or in Jamaica. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, antenatal depressive symptoms among Jamaican women in order to inform policy and build interventions that could improve their management and reduce their negative consequences. Methods This secondary analysis of data from the second Jamaican Birth Cohort Study (JA-Kids Birth Cohort) included 3,517 women enrolled during pregnancy. Information was extracted from interviewer-administered questionnaires which recorded social, demographic, medical and obstetric information during pregnancy. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) was used to screen for depression, with scores ≥13 considered indicative of a high likelihood of depression. Bivariate analysis examined associations between depressive symptoms and: age, income, financial difficulties, perceived social support, perceived partner infidelity, previous child-bearing unions and children with the current partner. Obstetric factors were also explored and included gravidity, prior adverse pregnancy outcome and complications from previous pregnancies. Variables that predicted the likelihood of depression based on an EPDS cut score of 13 were evaluated using logistic regression. Results One in five participants (19.6%; 95% CI 18.3–20.9%) had a high likelihood of antenatal depression (EPDS ≥13). Significant predictors of high depressive symptom severity included four indicators of poor perceived social and partner support [ORs (95% CI) ranged from: 1.61 (1.07–2.43); p = 0.024 to 3.14(1.69–5.84); p< 0.001], perceived partner infidelity [1.86 (1.36, 2.54); p<0.001], exposure to violence [2.36 (1.66–3.38); p<0.001] and financial difficulties [1.39 (1.07, 1.80); p = 0.013]. Conclusions Women’s perceived social and partner support were strongly associated with depressive symptom severity. Within the Jamaican cultural context of unstable reproductive unions, efforts are needed to involve fathers in the antenatal care process to strategically improve the psychological well-being of new mothers which may positively influence long term developmental outcomes for their babies."
https://openalex.org/W2789275942,"Asbestos exposure is a determinate cause of many diseases, such as mesothelioma, fibrosis, and lung cancer, and poses a major human health hazard. At this time, there are no identified biomarkers to demarcate asbestos exposure before the presentation of disease and symptoms, and there is only limited understanding of the underlying biology that governs asbestos-induced disease. In our study, we used exosomes, 30-140 nm extracellular vesicles, to gain insight into these knowledge gaps. As inhaled asbestos is first encountered by lung epithelial cells and macrophages, we hypothesize that asbestos-exposed cells secrete exosomes with signature proteomic cargo that can alter the gene expression of mesothelial cells, contributing to disease outcomes like mesothelioma. In the present study using lung epithelial cells (BEAS2B) and macrophages (THP-1), we first show that asbestos exposure causes changes in abundance of some proteins in the exosomes secreted from these cells. Furthermore, exposure of human mesothelial cells (HPM3) to these exosomes resulted in gene expression changes related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and other cancer-related genes. This is the first report to indicate that asbestos-exposed cells secrete exosomes with differentially abundant proteins and that those exosomes have a gene-altering effect on mesothelial cells.-Munson, P., Lam, Y.-W., Dragon, J. MacPherson, M., Shukla, A. Exosomes from asbestos-exposed cells modulate gene expression in mesothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2791934036,"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a devastating disorder that is characterized by a progressive decline in renal function as a result of the development of fluid-filled cysts. Defective flow-mediated [Ca2+]i responses and disrupted [Ca2+]i homeostasis have been repeatedly associated with cyst progression in ADPKD. We have previously demonstrated that the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) channel is imperative for flow-mediated [Ca2+]i responses in murine distal renal tubule cells. To determine whether compromised TRPV4 function contributes to aberrant Ca2+ regulation in ADPKD, we assessed TRPV4 function in primary cells that were cultured from ADPKD and normal human kidneys (NHKs). Single-channel TRPV4 activity and TRPV4-dependent Ca2+ influxes were drastically reduced in ADPKD cells, which correlated with distorted [Ca2+]i signaling. Whereas total TRPV4 protein levels were comparable in NHK and ADPKD cells, we detected a marked decrease in TRPV4 glycosylation in ADPKD cells. Tunicamycin-induced deglycosylation inhibited TRPV4 activity and compromised [Ca2+]i signaling in NHK cells. Overall, we demonstrate that TRPV4 glycosylation and channel activity are diminished in human ADPKD cells compared with NHK cells, and that this contributes significantly to the distorted [Ca2+]i dynamics. We propose that TRPV4 stimulation may be beneficial for restoring [Ca2+]i homeostasis in cyst cells, thereby interfering with ADPKD progression.-Tomilin, V., Reif, G. A., Zaika, O., Wallace, D.

Microscopic analyses of a hem1Δ shu1Δ str3Δ mutant strain in the presence of the heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin IX (ZnMP) revealed that ZnMP fails to accumulate within the mutant cells. In contrast, Str3-expressing hem1Δ shu1Δ cells could take up ZnMP at a 10-μm concentration. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cannot efficiently transport exogenously supplied hemin. However, heterologous expression of Str3 from S. pombe in S. cerevisiae resulted in ZnMP accumulation within S. cerevisiae cells.

Overexpression of the 14-3-3 proteins σ, ɛ, ζ, and η correlates with high metastatic potential in multiple cancer types. In Dictyostelium, 14-3-3 promotes myosin II turnover in the cell cortex and modulates cortical tension, cell shape, and cytokinesis. In light of the important roles of 14-3-3 proteins across a broad range of eukaryotic species, we sought to determine how 14-3-3 proteins interact with myosin II. Here, conducting in vitro and in vivo studies of both Dictyostelium (one 14-3-3 and one myosin II) and human proteins (seven 14-3-3s and three nonmuscle myosin IIs), we investigated the mechanism by which 14-3-3 proteins regulate myosin II assembly. Using in vitro assembly assays with purified myosin II tail fragments and 14-3-3, we demonstrate that this interaction is direct and phosphorylation-independent. All seven human 14-3-3 proteins also altered assembly of at least one paralog of myosin II. Our findings indicate a mechanism of myosin II assembly regulation that is mechanistically conserved across a billion years of evolution from amebas to humans.

https://openalex.org/W2792519529,"Dengue fever, chikungunya fever and Zika virus are epidemics in Brazil that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus. The liquid from shells of cashew nuts is attractive for its important biological and therapeutic activities, which include toxicity to mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. The present study evaluated the effects of a mixture of surfactants from natural cashew nutshell liquid and castor oil (named TaLCC-20) on the mortality of larvae and on the reproductive performance, embryonic and fetal development and genetic stability of Swiss mice. A total of 400 Ae. aegypti larvae (third larval stage) were treated with TaLCC-20 concentrations of 0.05 mg/L, 0.5 mg/L, or 5 mg/L (ppm). Twenty pregnant female mice were also orally administered TaLCC-20 at doses of 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg body weight (b.w.), and 10 animals were given only drinking water at 0.1 mL/10 g b.w. (orally). The results of a larvicide test demonstrated that 5 mg/mL TaLCC-20 killed 100% of larvae within three hours, which is comparable to the gold standard indicated by the Ministry of Health. Overall, these results show that TaLCC-20 is an efficient larvicide that does not induce genetic damage. In addition, changes in reproductive performance and embryo-fetal development appear positive, and the formulation is cost effective. Therefore, TaLCC-20 is an important product in the exploration of natural larvicides and can assist in fighting mosquitos as vectors for dengue fever, chikungunya fever and Zika virus, which are emerging/re-emerging and require proper management to ensure minimal harm to the human population. Therefore, TaLCC-20 can be considered a key alternative to commercial products, which are effective yet toxigenic."
https://openalex.org/W2792109300,"Nuclear activated β-catenin plays a causative role in colorectal cancers (CRC) but remains an elusive therapeutic target. Using human CRC cells harboring different Wnt/β-catenin pathway mutations in APC/KRAS or β-catenin/KRAS genes, and both genetic and pharmacological knockdown approaches, we show that oncogenic β-catenin signaling negatively regulates the expression of NHERF1 (Na+/H+ exchanger 3 regulating factor 1), a PDZ-adaptor protein that is usually lost or downregulated in early dysplastic adenomas to exacerbate nuclear β-catenin activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that β-catenin represses NHERF1 via TCF4 directly, while the association between TCF1 and the Nherf1 promoter increased upon β-catenin knockdown. To note, the occurrence of a cytostatic survival response in settings of single β-catenin-depleted CRC cells was abrogated by combining NHERF1 inhibition via small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or RS5517, a novel PDZ1-domain ligand of NHERF1 that prevented its ectopic nuclear entry. Mechanistically, dual NHERF1/β-catenin targeting promoted an autophagy-to-apoptosis switch consistent with the activation of Caspase-3, the cleavage of PARP and reduced levels of phospho-ERK1/2, Beclin-1, and Rab7 autophagic proteins compared with β-catenin knockdown alone. Collectively, our data unveil novel β-catenin/TCF-dependent mechanisms of CRC carcinogenesis, also offering preclinical proof of concept for combining β-catenin and NHERF1 pharmacological inhibitors as a mechanism-based strategy to augment apoptotic death of CRC cells refractory to current Wnt/β-catenin-targeted therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2792527550,"Chronic liver injury triggers liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Cyclin E1 (CcnE1, formerly designated Cyclin E) is a regulatory subunit of the Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). It is overexpressed in approximately 70% of human HCCs correlating with poor prognosis, while the relevance of its orthologue Cyclin E2 (CcnE2) is unclear. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMOΔhepa) leads to chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis, and HCC as well as CcnE upregulation. To this end, we generated NEMOΔhepa/CcnE1-/- and NEMOΔhepa/CcnE2-/- double knockout mice and investigated age-dependent liver disease progression in these animals. Deletion of CcnE1 in NEMOΔhepa mice decreased basal liver damage and reduced spontaneous liver inflammation in young mice. In contrast, loss of CcnE2 did not affect liver injury in NEMOΔhepa livers pointing to a unique, non-redundant function of CcnE1 in chronic hepatitis. Accordingly, basal compensatory hepatocyte proliferation in NEMOΔhepa mice was reduced by concomitant ablation of CcnE1, but not after loss of CcnE2. In aged NEMOΔhepa mice, loss of CcnE1 resulted in significant reduction of liver tumorigenesis, while deletion of CcnE2 had no effect on HCC formation. CcnE1, but not its orthologue CcnE2, substantially contributes to hepatic inflammatory response, liver disease progression, and hepatocarcinogenesis in NEMOΔhepa mice."
https://openalex.org/W2792613404,"The voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channel Kv2.1 is a major delayed rectifier in many secretory cells, including pancreatic β cells. In addition, Kv2.1 has a direct role in exocytosis at an undefined step, involving SNARE proteins, that is independent of its ion-conducting pore function. Here, we elucidated the precise step in exocytosis. We previously reported that syntaxin-3 (Syn-3) is the key syntaxin that mediates exocytosis of newcomer secretory granules that spend minimal residence time on the plasma membrane before fusion. Using high-resolution total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we now show that Kv2.1 forms reservoir clusters on the β-cell plasma membrane and binds Syn-3 via its C-terminal C1b domain, which recruits newcomer insulin secretory granules into this large reservoir. Upon glucose stimulation, secretory granules were released from this reservoir to replenish the pool of newcomer secretory granules for subsequent fusion, occurring just adjacent to the plasma membrane Kv2.1 clusters. C1b deletion blocked the aforementioned Kv2.1-Syn-3–mediated events and reduced fusion of newcomer secretory granules. These insights have therapeutic implications, as Kv2.1 overexpression in type-2 diabetes rat islets restored biphasic insulin secretion.

https://openalex.org/W2790468460,"The recent use of RNA-Seq to study the transcriptomes of different species has helped identify a large number of new genes from different non-model organisms. In this study, five distinctive transcripts encoding for neuropeptide members of the CHH/MIH/GIH family have been identified from the spermatophore transcriptome of the shrimp Fenneropenaeus merguiensis. The size of these transcripts ranged from 531 bp to 1771 bp. Four transcripts encoded different CHH-family subtype I members, and one transcript encoded a subtype II member. RT-PCR and RACE approaches have confirmed the expression of these genes in males. The low degree of amino acid sequence identity among these neuropeptides suggests that they may have different specific function(s). Results from a phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that these neuropeptides were likely derived from a common ancestor gene resulting from mutation and gene duplication. These CHH-family members could be grouped into distinct clusters, indicating a strong structural/functional relationship among these neuropeptides. Eyestalk removal caused a significant increase in the expression of transcript 32710 but decreases in expression for transcript 28020. These findings suggest the possible regulation of these genes by eyestalk factor(s). In summary, the results of this study would justify a re-evaluation of the more generalized and pleiotropic functions of these neuropeptides. This study also represents the first report on the cloning/identification of five CHH family neuropeptides in a non-neuronal tissue from a single crustacean species."

https://openalex.org/W2790848883,"A main feature of Fabry disease is nephropathy, with polyuria an early manifestation; however, the mechanism that underlies polyuria and affected tubules is unknown. To increase globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) levels, we previously crossbred asymptomatic Glatm mice with transgenic mice that expressed human Gb3 synthase (A4GALT) and generated the GlatmTg(CAG-A4GALT) symptomatic Fabry model mice. Additional analyses revealed that these mice exhibit polyuria and renal dysfunction without remarkable glomerular damage. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of polyuria and renal dysfunction in these mice. Gb3 accumulation was mostly detected in the medulla; medullary thick ascending limbs (mTALs) were the most vacuolated tubules. mTAL cells contained lamellar bodies and had lost their characteristic structure ( i.e., extensive infolding and numerous elongated mitochondria). Decreased expression of the major molecules-Na+-K+-ATPase, uromodulin, and Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter-that are involved in Na+ reabsorption in mTALs and the associated loss of urine-concentrating ability resulted in progressive water- and salt-loss phenotypes. GlatmTg(CAG-A4GALT) mice exhibited fibrosis around mTALs and renal dysfunction. These and other features were consistent with pathologic findings in patients with Fabry disease. Results demonstrate that mTAL dysfunction causes polyuria and renal impairment and contributes to the pathophysiology of Fabry nephropathy.-Maruyama, H., Taguchi, A., Nishikawa, Y., Guili, C., Mikame, M., Nameta, M., Yamaguchi, Y., Ueno, M., Imai, N., Ito, Y., Nakagawa, T., Narita, I., Ishii, S.

https://openalex.org/W2794400813,"Aims/Hypothesis The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which severe hypoglycemia accelerates vascular complications. Furthermore, we assessed the possible protective effect of ketone bodies against the endothelial cell damage caused by glucose deficiency. Methods Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured at a glucose level of either 0.56 or 5.6 mmol/L with or without 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) supplementation. Cell viability was assessed with a CCK-8 assay and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. The activity of caspases was measured using fluorogenic substrates. The expression of genes associated with endothelial cell function and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. Protein levels of ER stress-related molecules were assessed by Western blotting. Results Culture of HUVECs in low-glucose medium for 24 or 48 h resulted in reduction of cell viability accompanied by activation of caspase-3/7 and caspase-8. The addition of a pan caspase inhibitor attenuated the cell death. After incubation in the low-glucose medium, we found reduced mRNA and protein levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. ER stress responses mediated by phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) were augmented, but X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) splicing was reduced. Most of these responses to glucose deficiency were significantly attenuated by supplementation with 3-HB. Conclusions/Interpretation These observations showed that exposure to low glucose induces ER stress, caspase activation, endothelial cell dysfunction and cell death. The beneficial effects of 3-HB shown in this study suggest that hypoketonemic severe hypoglycemia induced by insulin injections or insulin secretagogue administration may be more harmful than hyperketonemic severe hypoglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2791237040,"We have discovered an unexpected connection between a critical lung development and cancer gene termed thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1 also known as NKX2-1) and cholesterol metabolism. Our published work implicates that TTF-1 positively regulates miR-33a which is known to repress ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) and thus its cholesterol efflux activity. We set out to demonstrate that a higher TTF-1 expression would presumably inhibit cholesterol efflux and consequently raise intracellular cholesterol level. Surprisingly, raising TTF-1 expression actually lowers intracellular cholesterol level, which, we believe, is attributed to a direct transactivation of ABCA1 by TTF-1. Subsequently, we show that lung cancer cells primed with a TTF-1-driven decrease of cholesterol were more vulnerable to simvastatin, a frequently prescribed cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor. In view of the fact that pathologists routinely interrogate human lung cancers for TTF-1 immunopositivity to guide diagnosis and the prevalent use of statins, TTF-1 should be further investigated as a putative biomarker of lung cancer vulnerability to statins."

The ""Attentively Embracing Story"" theory is applied to help individuals transform negative thoughts into positive, and reflect on spiritual healing. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a ""Story-Centred Care Intervention Program"" based on the ""Attentively Embracing Story"" theory in improving depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and heart rate variability in institutionalized elderly people. Seventy long-term care residents were recruited from two long-term care facilities and randomized into the story-centred care intervention (n = 35) and control groups (n = 35). We excluded five long-term care residents who did not complete the post-test measures and five long-term care residents who had interference events on the outcome measures. Finally, sixty long-term care residents (40 women and 20 men; age 84.3±5.98 years) were included in the final analysis. Data were collected at four times (pre-intervention and post-intervention, 1 and 3-month follow-up) and analyzed with the generalized estimating equation approach.Instruments, including Geriatric Depression Scale, Short Portable Mind Status Questionnaire, and a CheckMyHeart device to measure heart rate variability, were used in study. The degree of improvement in depressive symptoms was significantly higher in the story-centred care intervention group than in the control group after providing the story-centred care intervention program (p < .001) and at 1 and 3-month follow-up (p = .001, p = .006, respectively; GDS-15 score reduced 1.816 at the 3-month follow-up). Participants receiving the story-centred care intervention program showed significantly greater improvement than those in the control group in the cognitive function at 1and 3-month follow-up (p = .009, p = .024, respectively; SPMSQ score reduced 0.345 at the 3-month follow-up). The heart rate variability parameters (SDNN, RMSSD) did not show a statistically significant increase. However an increasing trend in the parameters was observed in the intervention group (SDNN increased 16.235ms at the 3-month follow-up; RMSSD increased 16.424 ms at the 3-month follow-up). In conclusions, the story-centred care intervention program was effective on the improvement of depressive symptoms and cognitive status in institutionalized elderly people."

The identification of the causal microorganism remains crucial and determines therapeutic strategies and success. Microbiology cultures remain the common method to diagnose PJI. Unfortunately, 14% of intra-articular punctures remain negative after culture. The microorganisms are best detected by inoculation of microbiology samples in blood culture bottles (Bactec), or after sonication of the implant and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The identification of the causal microorganism remains crucial and determines therapeutic success.This study was conducted to assess the effect of culture lead time and sample storage temperature on the detection of the pathogen.We obtained bone fragments from femoral heads during primary arthroplasty. Bone fragments were contaminated with a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Four set-ups with different combinations of storage delay and storage temperature were tested.Our study shows the need to cultivate as soon as possible and optimally within 2h after the completion of sampling. Temporary storage in a refrigerator at 4°C also appears to have a positive influence on bacterial viability. At present, these conclusions concern only the Staphylococcus Epidermidis. Others studies are requested to generalize this conclusion to other bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2793243717,"Like many other high elevation alpine tree species, Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata Engelm.) may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. To evaluate its potential vulnerability to shifts in climate, we defined the suitable climate space for each of four genetic lineages of bristlecone pine and for other subalpine tree species in close proximity to bristlecone pine forests. Measuring changes in the suitable climate space for lineage groups is an important step beyond models that assume species are genetically homogenous. The suitable climate space for bristlecone pine in the year 2090 is projected to decline by 74% and the proportional distribution of suitable climate space for genetic lineages shifts toward those associated with warmer and wetter conditions. The 2090 climate space for bristlecone pine exhibits a bimodal distribution along an elevation gradient, presumably due to the persistence of the climate space in the Southern Rocky Mountains and exclusion at mid-elevations by conditions that favor the climate space of other species. These shifts have implications for changes in fire regimes, vulnerability to pest and pathogens, and altered carbon dynamics across the southern Rockies, which may reduce the likelihood of bristlecone pine trees achieving exceptional longevity in the future. The persistence and expansion of climate space for southern bristlecone pine genetic lineage groups in 2090 suggests that these sources may be the least vulnerable in the future. While these lineages may be more likely to persist and therefore present opportunities for proactive management (e.g., assisted migration) to maintain subalpine forest ecosystem services in a warmer world, our findings also imply heighted conservation concern for vulnerable northern lineages facing range contractions."
https://openalex.org/W2791841798,"In chronic hemodialyzed (CH) patients the balance between production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defense system is disturbed and shifted towards oxidative conditions. The properties of albumin in CH patients were studied before hemodialysis (HD) and post-HD.Two oxidants were applied, organic t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) and inorganic hydroperoxide (H2O2), for oxidation of albumin molecules. By comparison, albumin from healthy donors was also modified by both oxidants. The thiol content in albumin was determined by the Ellman method. Albumin properties were evaluated with the spin labelling technique using two covalently bound spin labels, maleimide (MSL) and iodoacetamide (ISL), and fatty acid spin probe, 16-doxylstearic acid (16-DS).A decrease in thiols level in HD albumin was greater than in control albumin. The t-BOOH modified the microenvironment at the binding site of MSL and ISL in control albumin molecules to a greater extent than hydrogen peroxide. Control albumin treated with t-BOOH and H2O2 showed an increase in the mobility of 16-DS. However, no changes were observed in albumin from CH patients treated with either of the oxidizing agents.Both oxidants induced strong conformational changes in albumin from healthy volunteers, but were less effective or ineffective in modification of albumin derived from CH patients. These results show that albumin from CH patients is highly modified in vivo and is not vulnerable to oxidation in the same way as normal albumin."

Since the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in Korea in 2007, the prevalence of rotaviral gastroenteritis has decreased. However, little is known on the economic burden of rotavirus infection and its variations in Korea. Here, we estimated the economic costs of rotavirus infection from 2009 to 2012 using nationwide data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) claims. Socioeconomic costs were subdivided into direct and indirect and measured with a prevalence-based approach. Costs were converted from Won to United States dollars (US$). The number of children <5 years old infected with rotavirus decreased from 21,437 to 10,295 during the study period, representing a decrease in prevalence from 947 to 443 per 100,000. The sum of direct and indirect costs also decreased, from $17.3 million to $9.6 million, and the days of admission decreased from 76,000 to 38,000. However, per capita expenditures slightly increased, from $809 to $934. Thus, the economic burden of rotavirus infection decreased after implementation of rotavirus vaccination. Including the vaccine as part of the national essential vaccination program could reduce the prevalence of and economic loss from rotavirus infection in Korea."
