https://openalex.org/W2046436217,"Tau protein is the major component of the intraneuronal filamentous inclusions that constitute defining neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. The discovery of tau gene mutations in familial forms of frontotemporal dementia has established that dysfunction of the tau protein is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia. Here we have tested 42 compounds belonging to nine different chemical classes for their ability to inhibit heparin-induced assembly of tau into filaments in vitro. Several phenothiazines (methylene blue, azure A, azure B, and quinacrine mustard), polyphenols (myricetin, epicatechin 5-gallate, gossypetin, and 2,3,4,2′,4′-pentahydroxybenzophenone), and the porphyrin ferric dehydroporphyrin IX inhibited tau filament formation with IC50 values in the low micromolar range as assessed by thioflavin S fluorescence, electron microscopy, and Sarkosyl insolubility. Disassembly of tau filaments was observed in the presence of the porphyrin phthalocyanine. Compounds that inhibited tau filament assembly were also found to inhibit the formation of Aβ fibrils. Biochemical analysis revealed the formation of soluble oligomeric tau in the presence of the inhibitory compounds, suggesting that this may be the mechanism by which tau filament formation is inhibited. The compounds investigated did not affect the ability of tau to interact with microtubules. Identification of small molecule inhibitors of heparin-induced assembly of tau will form a starting point for the development of mechanism-based therapies for the tauopathies.

The extracellular plaque deposits are made of β-amyloid, a 40–42-amino acid proteolytic fragment of the amyloid precursor protein. The identification of the genetic defects that cause early onset AD has established that Aβ production and aggregation are central to the development of AD (2Goate A. Chartier-Harlin M.C. Mullan M.

The intracellular neurofibrillary lesions consist of paired helical filaments and straight filaments, which are made of the microtubule-associated protein tau in a hyperphosphorylated state (1St George-Hyslop P.H.

The temporal and spatial accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein correlates with nerve cell loss and the severity of dementia.Tau inclusions, in the absence of extracellular deposits, are characteristic of progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, argyrophilic grain disease, and frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (6Lee V.M.Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). The identification of mutations in the tau gene in FTDP-17 has established that dysfunction of tau protein is central to the neurodegenerative process (7Poorkaj P. Bird T.D. Wijsman E. Nemens E.

A. 1998; 95: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Currently, more than 30 different mutations in the tau gene have been described in over 100 families with FTDP-17.Fibrils formed from Aβ display a prototypical cross-β structure characteristic of amyloid (10Kirschner D. Inouye H. Duffy L. Sinclair A. Lind D. Selkoe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The same structure has been demonstrated for many other filaments deposited in the extracellular space in systemic and organ-specific amyloidoses (11Eanes E.D. Glenner G.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1968; 16: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), including prion protein deposits in Gerstmann-Straüssler-Scheinker syndrome and some cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (12Nguyen J.T. Inouye H. Baldwin M.A. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Kirschner D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 412-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Considerably less work has been done on filaments that form intracellularly. Filaments assembled from α-synuclein were shown by various techniques to possess cross-β structure (13Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), as were the synthetic filaments formed from exon 1 of huntingtin with 51 glutamines (14Perutz M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 58-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). More recently, tau filaments, both those extracted from human brain and those assembled in vitro from recombinant protein, were also shown to have a cross-β structure (15Berriman J. Serpell L.C. Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9034-9038Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is therefore appropriate to consider the tauopathies a form of brain amyloidosis.The conversion of a small number of soluble peptides and proteins into insoluble filaments is believed to be the central event in the etiology of the most common neurodegenerative diseases (16Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Prusiner S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Consequently, many current therapeutic strategies are aimed at inhibiting filament formation and at promoting filament clearance. They include the use of antibodies, synthetic peptides, heat shock proteins, and chemical compounds. Among these, small organic molecules have been extensively tested for their ability to inhibit filament formation in vitro, particularly in relation to Aβ deposition (18Findeis M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the formation of protease-resistant forms of the prion protein (19Cashman N.R. Caughey B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 874-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the aggregation of huntingtin (20Heiser V. Engemann S. Bro ̈cker W. Dunkel I. Boeddrich A. Waelter S. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Schugardt N. Rautenberg S. Herhaus C. Barnickel G. Bo ̈ttcher H. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16400-16406Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). By contrast, there are only a few reports of therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting tau filament formation. In one study, the formation of aggregates made of truncated tau protein was inhibited by a number of phenothiazines, although the filamentous nature of the aggregates was not demonstrated (21Wischik C.M. Edwards P.C. Lai R.Y.K. Roth M. Harrington C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11213-11218Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Phenothiazines have also been shown to inhibit the conversion of soluble prion protein into the protease-resistant form (22Roikhel V.M. Fokina G.I. Pogodina V.V. Acta Virol. 1984; 28: 321-324PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dees C. Wade W.F. German T.L. Marsh R.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1985; 66: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Doh-Ura K. Iwaki T.

A. 2001; 98: 9836-9841Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In a second study, arachidonic acid-induced tau filament formation was found to be inhibited by a benzothiazole compound that did not affect Aβ or α-synuclein assembly (26Chirita C. Necula M. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent study reported the inhibition of heparin-induced tau filament formation by a number of compounds, including daunorubicin hydrochloride and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THBP) (27Pickhardt M. Gazova Z. von Bergen M. Khlistunova I. Wang Y. Hascher A. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3628-3635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).Here we have investigated the effects of 42 compounds belonging to nine different chemical classes on heparin-induced tau filament formation. The ability of these compounds to inhibit the assembly of Aβ was investigated in parallel. Filament formation was assessed using electron microscopy, thioflavin S (ThS) fluorescence, and the formation of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau protein. Several compounds belonging to the phenothiazine, polyphenol, and porphyrin classes were found to inhibit tau filament formation by binding to soluble, SDS-stable tau oligomers.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of Tau Protein—The 412-amino acid isoform of human brain tau (28Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar) was expressed from cDNA clone htau46 in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), purified as described (29Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and dialyzed against 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Following separation by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Aquapore RP300 column), the absorbance at 215 nm was measured and compared with that of tau protein of known concentration, to give the concentration of the freshly purified protein.Tau Filament Assembly and Inhibitor Testing—Purified recombinant tau (1 mg/ml) and heparin (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h in 50 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% sodium azide (30Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of the compounds listed in Table I. The different compounds were used at concentrations ranging from 20 nm to 200 μm. For a semi-quantitative assessment of filament formation, electron microscopy was used. Aliquots (2 μl) of assembly mixtures were placed on collodion-coated 300-mesh copper grids, stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate, and micrographs recorded at a nominal magnification of ×30,000 on a JEOL 1200EXII electron microscope. For a quantitative assessment of filament formation, ThS fluorescence and levels of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau were assessed. For ThS fluorescence, aliquots (20 μl) of assembly mixtures were removed at various time points and brought to 300 μl with 5 μm ThS (Sigma) in 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8. Fluorimetry was performed using a Hitachi F4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (set at 440 nm excitation/521 nm emission) (31Naiki H. Higuchi K. Matsushima K. Shimada A. Chen W.H. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Lab. Investig. 1990; 62: 768-773PubMed Google Scholar, 32Friedhoff P. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10223-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble tau was prepared as follows. Aliquots (25 μl) of assembly mixtures were removed, added to 125 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% Sarkosyl, and left at room temperature for 1 h. The mixtures were then spun at 150,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants (Sarkosyl-soluble tau) were removed, and the pellets (Sarkosyl-insoluble tau) were resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, prior to SDS-PAGE. Following staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the intensities of the Sarkosyl-insoluble tau bands were quantified by scanning densitometry, as described (29Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Each compound was tested at least three times at each concentration, and the results were expressed as % of tau assembly in the absence of any compound, taken as 100. Statistical analysis was carried out by unpaired t test using Kai plot software, and the results were expressed as the means ± S.D. IC50 values were calculated for each compound by using the levels of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau.Table IList of compounds Open table in a new tab Aβ Filament Assembly and Inhibitor Testing—Monomeric Aβ-(1–40) (1 mm, Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan) in distilled water was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 15 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in 40 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, containing 5 μm thioflavin T, in the presence or absence of compounds (0.3–40 μm). Fluorimetry was performed using a Biolumin960 fluorescence spectrophotometer (set at 450 nm excitation/485 nm emission, Amersham Biosciences) (31Naiki H. Higuchi K. Matsushima K. Shimada A. Chen W.H. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Lab. Investig. 1990; 62: 768-773PubMed Google Scholar), and IC50 values were calculated for each compound.Disassembly of Tau Filaments—Sarkosyl pellets of recombinant tau assemblies were washed and resuspended at 4 μm (0.2 mg/ml) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Following the addition of compounds (concentration range of 20 nm to 200 μm), the assemblies were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C, followed by a 20-min centrifugation at 150,000 × g. Supernatants and pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.Microtubule Binding and Assembly Assays—To examine the effects of inhibitors of tau filament assembly on the ability of tau to bind to microtubules, recombinant tau protein at 2 μm (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with various concentrations of inhibitors (0.2–20 μm) in assembly buffer (80 mm Pipes, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm GTP, pH 6.8) for 30 min at 37 °C. Taxol-stabilized microtubules (1 mg/ml) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Following a 20-min spin at 150,000 × g, aliquots of the supernatants (tau not bound to microtubules) and pellets (tau bound to microtubules) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Each experiment was repeated three times. To study the effects of inhibitors of tau filament assembly on the ability of tau to promote microtubule assembly, recombinant tau protein was incubated with the inhibitors (0.2–20 μm) as described above. Tubulin (20 μm, Cytoskeleton) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, as described previously (29Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The assembly of tubulin into microtubules was monitored over time by a change in turbidity at 350 nm. Each experiment was repeated three times. Several compounds gave a weak absorbance at 350 nm, which was subtracted.Binding of Tau to Heparin-Sepharose—Recombinant tau protein (1 mg/ml) was incubated with heparin-Sepharose (AF-heparin Toyopearl 650 M) at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of the various compounds (0.2–200 μm). Bound tau was eluted sequentially with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 m NaCl and run on SDS-PAGE.Preparation and Characterization of Monomeric Tau, Filamentous Tau, and Aged Soluble Tau—Freshly prepared protein was the source of monomeric tau. Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets of tau assembly mixtures were the source of filamentous tau. Aged soluble tau was defined as the protein remaining in the supernatant following the ultracentrifugation of tau assembly mixtures incubated with heparin for 72 h. Limited protease digestion was used for further characterization. Monomeric tau, aged soluble tau, and filamentous tau were incubated with 20 and 200 μg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C, and the digests were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. In some experiments, aged soluble tau was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography using a TSK 3000SWXL column in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. As a control, heparin was added to freshly prepared tau and loaded onto the column without further incubation.Interaction of Compounds with Monomeric Tau, Aged Soluble Tau, and Filamentous Tau—Monomeric, aged soluble, and filamentous tau were incubated with the various compounds (2–20 μm) for 12 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and SDS-PAGE. The binding of compounds to monomeric and oligomeric tau was investigated by incubating 2 μm protein purified by gel filtration with 20 μm azure A, myricetin, and hematin in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 12 h at 37 °C. Bound and unbound compounds were separated using a Sephadex G-25 spin column, as described (33Lee E.N. Cho H.J. Lee C.H. Lee D. Chung K.C. Paik S.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3704-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Column-excluded tau was quantified, and the levels of tau-bound compounds were determined by measuring the absorbance of hematin at 400 nm, myricetin at 500 nm, and azure A at 670 nm. The binding of azure A, myricetin, and hematin to tau filaments was assessed by incubating 2 μm of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau with 20 μm of compound in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 12 h at 37 °C, followed by ultracentrifugation. Bound reagent was solubilized with 100 μl of Me2SO, and the levels of tau-bound compounds were determined by measuring the absorbance as above. The chosen wavelengths were established as being characteristic of each compound by using scanning spectra from 200 to 750 nm.RESULTSInhibition of Tau Filament Assembly—42 compounds belonging to nine different chemical classes (listed in Table I) were tested for their ability to inhibit the heparin-induced assembly of tau into filaments. By electron microscopy, a large reduction in the number of tau filaments was observed in the presence of several phenothiazines (methylene blue, lacmoid, azures A–C, and thionin), polyphenols (exifone, gossypetin, 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone, purpurogallin, 2,3,4,2′,4′-pentahydroxybenzophenone, myricetin, and epicatechin 3-gallate), and porphyrins (hemin chloride, hematin, ferric dehydroporphyrin IX, and phthalocyanine). Other phenothiazines (chlorpromazine hydrochloride, perphenazine, promazine hydrochloride, acetopromazine maleate, and propionylpromazine hydrochloride) and polyphenols (apigenin, epicatechin and 2,2-dihydroxybezophenone) did not affect filament formation. Benzothiazoles, rifamycins, polyene macrolides, anthracyclines, sulfonated dyes, and methyl yellow were also without effect. A representative example of each class of compound is shown in Fig. 1A. The same compounds were tested using the ThS fluorescence assay (Fig. 1B). A reduced fluorescence was observed in the samples incubated with methylene blue, exifone, and hemin chloride, in agreement with the electron microscopic findings. In addition, tau filament formation was quantified by measuring the levels of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, little or no Sarkosyl-insoluble tau was detected in tau assembly mixtures incubated in the presence of methylene blue, exifone, or hemin chloride, consistent with the findings by electron microscopy and ThS fluorescence.Fig. 1Inhibition of tau filament formation by phenothiazine, polyphenol, and porphyrin compounds. A, semiquantitative electron microscopic assessment of tau filaments formed in the absence (Control) or the presence of compounds. Filament numbers similar to controls were observed in the presence of APMT, rifamycin B, mycostatin, daunorubicin, Ponceau SS, and methyl yellow. By contrast, only small numbers of filaments were seen in the presence of exifone, hemin chloride, and methylene blue. B, quantitation of tau filament formation using ThS fluorescence. A significant reduction in fluorescence was observed in the presence of exifone, hemin chloride, and methylene blue (* = p < 0.001, n = 6, unpaired t test). Results are given as means ± S.E. and expressed as % fluorescence of controls (taken as 100%). Statistical analysis was done by unpaired t test using Kai plot software. C–E, quantitation of tau filament formation using levels of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau. C and D, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and quantitation by densitometry. A significant reduction in Sarkosyl-insoluble tau was observed in the presence of exifone, hemin chloride, and methylene blue (* = p < 0.001, n = 6, unpaired t test). E, concentration-dependent inhibition of tau filament formation by six different polyphenols. Sarkosyl-insoluble tau was analyzed following a 72-h incubation of tau and heparin with exifone (a), gossypetin (b), 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (c), apigenin (d), epicatechin (e), and 2,2′-dihydroxybenzophenone (f), each used at 0.02, 0.2, 2.0, 20, and 200 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next determined the IC50 values of phenothiazines, polyphenols, and porphyrins for inhibiting tau filament assembly by quantifying the levels of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau. Inhibition of tau filament formation was concentration-dependent, as illustrated in Fig. 1E for polyphenol compounds. The IC50 values of phenothiazines, polyphenols, and porphyrins for inhibiting tau filament assembly are given in Table II, where they are compared with the ability of the same compounds to inhibit Aβ aggregation. A strong inhibitory effect on tau filament assembly (IC50 values of 1–2 μm) was observed with myricetin, ferric dehydroporphyrin IX, epicachetin 3-gallate, methylene blue, azure B, and gossypetin. Other compounds, such as 2,3,4,2′,4′-pentahydroxybenzophenone, azure A, exifone, purpurogallin, and azure C were less strongly inhibitory (IC50 values of 2–10 μm). A weak inhibitory effect (IC50 values of 10–70 μm) was observed with hematin, thionin, 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone, hypericin, pseudohypericin, lacmoid, and phthalocyanine. No inhibition (IC50 values of >200 μm) was observed with apigenin, epicatechin, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, perphenazine, promazine hydrochloride, acetopromazine, and propionylpromazine.

https://openalex.org/W2094723419,"The major pathway for elimination of cholesterol in mammals is via secretion into bile. Biliary cholesterol secretion is mediated by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5 (G5) and ABCG8 (G8) and is stimulated by cholesterol and by the non-cholesterol steroids cholate and diosgenin. To define the relationship between G5G8 expression and biliary cholesterol secretion, we measured G5 and G8 mRNA levels and biliary cholesterol concentrations in genetically manipulated mice expressing 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, or 16 copies of the two genes. Biliary cholesterol levels varied directly with G5G8 copy number and hepatic mRNA levels over a >16-fold range. Thus neither delivery of cholesterol to the transporter nor levels of cholesterol acceptors in bile were limiting under these conditions. In wild-type mice, cholate and diosgenin both increased biliary cholesterol concentrations 2-3-fold. The increase in biliary cholesterol content was dependent on expression of G5 and G8; neither steroid increased biliary cholesterol levels in G5G8-/- mice. Cholate treatment was associated with a farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-dependent increase in hepatic mRNA and protein levels of G5 and G8. In contrast to cholate, diosgenin treatment did not affect G5G8 expression. Diosgenin increased the expression of several pregnane X receptor (PXR) target genes and the choleretic effect of diosgenin was reduced by approximately 70% in PXR knock-out mice. Thus G5 and G8 are required to modulate biliary cholesterol secretion in response to cholate and diosgenin, but the choleretic effects of these two steroids are mediated by different mechanisms requiring FXR and PXR, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2024625315,"β-Arrestins were initially shown, in conjunction with G protein-coupled receptor kinases, to be involved in the desensitization and internalization of activated seven-transmembrane receptors. Recently, β-arrestin 2 has been shown to act as a signal mediator in mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and to play a positive regulatory role in chemotaxis. We now show that β-arrestin 1 is required to activate the small GTPase RhoA leading to the re-organization of stress fibers following the activation of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor. This angiotensin II type 1A receptor-directed RhoA activation and stress fiber formation also require the activation of the heterotrimeric G protein Gαq/11. Whereas neither β-arrestin 1 nor Gαq/11 activation alone is sufficient to robustly activate RhoA, the concurrent recruitment of β-arrestin 1 and activation of Gαq/11 leads to full activation of RhoA and to the subsequent formation of stress fibers. β-Arrestins were initially shown, in conjunction with G protein-coupled receptor kinases, to be involved in the desensitization and internalization of activated seven-transmembrane receptors.

RhoA in particular is important for stress fiber formation, whereas Rac and Cdc42 lead to lamellipodia and filopodia formation, respectively.

Hence, a variety of heterotrimeric G proteins have been shown to link 7TMs to Rho through several distinct pathways that are both 7TM- and cell type-dependent.Upon the activation of 7TMs, such as the AT1AR, scaffolding proteins called β-arrestins are recruited to the cytoplasmic face of the receptor where they desensitize heterotrimeric G protein signaling (31Attramadal H.

As a model, we utilized human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably expressing the AT1AR (AT1AR-HEK293). Here we show that in a concerted mechanism with Gαq/11, β-arrestin 1 is a critical component of RhoA activation and stress fiber formation following Ang II activation of the AT1AR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All of the tissue culture reagents, human Ang II, and Gαi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin were purchased from Sigma. ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, PLC inhibitors ET-18-OCH3 and U-73122, and PKC inhibitors Gö-6976, Gö-6983, and RO-31–8425 as well as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein were all purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). S1I4I8 Ang II (SII) was purchased from the Cleveland Clinic Core Synthesis Facility (Cleveland, OH). cDNA constructs for Gαq and GαqQL were generous gifts from the laboratory of Dr. Patrick Casey (Duke University, Durham, NC).Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). To make HEK293 cells stably expressing the AT1AR, cells were transfected with rat AT1AR cDNA that contained a zeocin-selectable marker using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable clones were selected that contained 1.6 ± 0.2 pmol/mg protein of AT1AR expression as determined by radioligand binding and were maintained in zeocin (Invitrogen).RNAi for β-Arrestin 1, β-Arrestin 2, and Gαq/11—AT1AR-HEK293 cells were split to a density of 100,000 cells/well into 6-well dishes at least 24 h prior to the transfection of control siRNA or siRNAs targeted against β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, or Gαq/11 using the Gene Silencer transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) as described previously (45Ahn S.

The siRNA sequence targeting overlapping regions of Gαq and Gα11 between nucleotides 931 and 951 relative to their start codons was 5′-AAGATGTTCGTGGACCTGAAC-3′. RhoA-pulldown and stress fiber formation assays were performed 3 days following the transfection of siRNA(s).GST-Rhotekin Pulldown Assay—GST-Rhotekin beads were prepared as described previously (47Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) with bound GST-Rhotekin were stored at 4 °C for not more than 7 days before being discarded. Following stimulation, cells were lysed in 1× ice-cold Mg2+ lysis buffer (125 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 5% Igepal CA-630, 50 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) (Upstate, Waltham, MA). Lysed cells were then incubated on ice for ∼10 min and then scraped into prechilled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,800 × g (13,000 rpm in International Equipment Company Micromax tabletop) for 5 min. A volume of lysate containing ∼65–80 μg of protein was then pipetted into a fresh prechilled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and mixed with 30 μg of GST-Rhotekin beads in a final volume of ∼300 μl. Lysates with beads were allowed to rotate for 1 h at 4 °C before beads were washed 3× with 0.5 ml of 1× Mg2+ lysis buffer. Following the last wash, the majority of supernatant was removed by pipette and the beads were aspirated to dryness with a flat gel-loading tip (Marsh Biomedical, Rochester, NY).Immunoblotting—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 12% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) for the determination of RhoA-GTP or Total RhoA or on 10% gels for the determination of β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, or Gαq/11. Bands were detected by immunoblotting with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), 1:10,000 dilution of the rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin 1/2 antibody A1CT (31Attramadal H.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit IgG was employed as the secondary antibody. Individual bands were then quantified by densitometry with a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad).F-actin Cytoskeletal Staining and Quantification—AT1AR-HEK293 cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends before cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde without methanol. Cells were then washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 before being stained with phalloidin as per the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). 25–40 individual cells were then visualized by three-dimensional confocal microscopy (LSM-510META, Carl Zeiss) per treatment group in each experiment. Acquisition parameters were kept constant for all of the experiments. Cell images were then coded and blindly placed into one of four bins: no stress fibers; low stress fibers; medium stress fibers; or high stress fibers. The medium and high stress fiber bins were then combined and shown as the percentage of total cells containing stress fibers.Cross-linking Immunoprecipitation of β-Arrestins and HA-AT1AR— Immunoprecipitation of HA-epitope-tagged AT1AR was performed in 100-mm dishes using AT1AR-HEK293 cells. Cells were starved for2hin 4 ml of PBS containing 10 mm HEPES and were subsequently stimulated as described in the figure legends. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of PBS containing 2.5 mm dithiobis(succinimi-dylpropionate) (Sigma) in 50% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide and 10 mm HEPES. Monolayers were agitated gently for 30 min at room temperature and then neutralized for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Monolayers were then washed with ice-cold PBS, solubilized in 0.6 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 15 μg/ml benzamidin, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), and clarified by centrifugation. 25-μl aliquots of clarified cross-linked detergent lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The remainder of each lysate was agitated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of 50% slurry of monoclonal anti-HA affinity-agarose (Sigma). After washing, immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above.GFP-β-Arrestin 1 Endocytosis with the AT1AR—HEK293-AT1AR cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding for GFP-β-arrestin 1, and recruitment/endocytosis of GFP-β-arrestin 1 with the AT1AR was determined as described previously (37Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar).Inositol Phosphate Determination—AT1AR-HEK293 cells were transiently transfected in 100-mm dishes with either empty plasmids, plasmids containing cDNAs for Gαq or GαqQL, or siRNA targeted against Gαq/11. One (plasmid) or two (siRNA) days post-transfection, cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates (BD Biosciences Labware, San Jose, CA). To assay for inositol phosphate production, cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in labeling medium (2.5 μCi (1 Ci = 37 GBq) of myo-[3H]inositol in 0.5 ml of minimum Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum/well). Cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 20 mm LiCl for 15 min at 37 °C and then treated with agonist in Hank's balanced salt solution for 10 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid, and total inositol phosphates were isolated by anion-exchange chromatography on Dowex AG1-X8 columns as described previously (48Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—All of the data were graphed and statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).RESULTSIn AT1AR-HEK293 cells, RhoA activation by 10 nm Ang II was quite rapid, reaching a maximal response at the earliest time point measured (1 min) (Fig. 1, A–C). This level of RhoA activation was sustained for 10 min before diminishing, reaching 49% maximal response at 20 min. To determine the role of β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 in AT1AR-mediated RhoA activation, RNAi was utilized, which reduced β-arrestin levels by ∼70% in all of the experiments (Fig. 1, A and D). Depletion of β-arrestin 2 by RNAi led to a slight increase in the levels of RhoA activation by Ang II over time (Fig. 1A and 1B, ANOVA p < 0.01) but did not significantly affect RhoA activation at any specific time point measured. In contrast, β-arrestin 1 depletion by RNAi dramatically reduced RhoA activation by 60% across the entire time course (Fig. 1, A and C, ANOVA p < 0.0001).Ang II activated RhoA in a dose-dependent fashion with an EC50 value of 10 nm and maximal RhoA-GTP levels at 100 nm Ang II (Fig. 1, D–E). Following the depletion of β-arrestin 1 by RNAi, maximal RhoA activation was significantly inhibited by 70% (Fig. 1, D and E, ANOVA p < 0.0001) with an unchanged EC50 value of 10 nm. Therefore, β-arrestin 1 is a necessary component of Ang II-activated RhoA-GTP over both time and dose.The effect of β-arrestin depletion on Ang II-stimulated stress fiber formation, a well established Rho-mediated event, was next determined. In the absence of Ang II stimulation, control cells, β-arrestin 2-depleted cells, and β-arrestin 1-depleted cells showed little to no stress fiber formation (Fig. 2, A and B). Stimulation with 10 nm Ang II for 30 min provoked robust reorganization of F-actin and stress fiber formation in 73 ± 6.1% control cells. The depletion of β-arrestin 2 had no significant effect on stress fiber formation as 61 ± 10.2% cells showed actin re-organization upon Ang II stimulation. However, upon depletion of β-arrestin 1, only 23 ± 5.2% cells showed stress fiber formation. This 70% reduction in stress fiber formation was consistent with the reduced RhoA activation observed under these conditions. To further elucidate the downstream effector of RhoA involved in the stress fiber formation, cells were pretreated for 15 min with 10 μm ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632. Under these conditions, stress fiber formation was inhibited by 100%, further substantiating RhoA and ROCK as the upstream components of a pathway leading to stress fiber formation following AT1AR activation by Ang II.Fig. 2Stress fiber formation was dependent on β-arrestin 1 but not β-arrestin 2. A, representative cells are shown before and after 30 min of 10 nm Ang II stimulation for control, β-arrestin 2, or β-arrestin 1-depleted cells. B, percentage of cells with stress fibers was quantified for each treatment group. Each bar represents the percentage of cells showing stress fiber formation (mean ± S.E.) for three independent experiments in which 25–40 cells were quantified by confocal microscopy. *, p < 0.01 and **, p < 0.001 compared with Ang II control stimulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Recently, an analog of Ang II, SII, that binds the AT1AR but does not activate heterotrimeric G proteins, has been shown to recruit β-arrestin 2 and activate ERK1/2 (37Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether SII is capable of recruiting β-arrestin 1 and, if it does, whether this recruitment in the absence of heterotrimeric G protein activation would be sufficient to activate RhoA. Therefore, the extent of β-arrestin 1 recruitment to the AT1AR and subsequent RhoA activation was determined using SII. Because the affinities of SII and Ang II are markedly different with Kd values of 310 and 1.6 nm, respectively (37Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), the AT1AR-HEK293 cells were stimulated with 10 μm SII or 1 or 100 nm Ang II for 1 min, the HA-AT1AR was subsequently immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the nitrocellulose was blotted for endogenous β-arrestins (Fig. 3, A and B). Whereas 1 nm Ang II weakly recruited β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 after 1 min, 100 nm Ang II robustly recruited both β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 with a preference for β-arrestin 2. Upon stimulation with 10 μm SII, β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 were clearly recruited to the AT1AR in a similar pattern (β-arrestin 2 greater than β-arrestin 1) as that induced by Ang II.Fig. 3SII stimulation leads to recruitment of β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 to the AT1AR. A, representative blots of β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 immunoprecipitated with the HA-AT1AR after stimulation with 1 or 100 nm Ang II or 10 μm SII. B, average recruitment of β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 following 1 min of stimulation is shown. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of four experiments. C, representative images of cells where GFP-β-arrestin 1 endocytosed into vesicles is shown following 20-min stimulation with 100 nm Ang II or 10 μm SII.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether SII could induce the sequestration of β-arrestin 1 into endocytotic vesicles in a fashion similar to that induced by Ang II, GFP-β-arrestin 1 was transiently transfected into AT1AR-HEK293 cells. Following 20 min of 10 nm Ang II or 10 μm SII stimulation, GFP-β-arrestin 1 had moved from the cytoplasm into internalized vesicles (Fig. 3C), typical of an Ang II-induced pattern of β-arrestin 1 recruitment. Quantification of the percentage of cells showing GFP-β-arrestin 1 or GFP-β-arrestin 2 in vesicles following 100 nm Ang II or 10 μm SII stimulation revealed that SII was less effective than Ang II at inducing β-arrestin endocytosis. Specifically, GFP-β-arrestin 1 was sequestered into vesicles in 94 ± 3.9 and 23.0 ± 3.0% cells for Ang II and SII, respectively, whereas GFP-β-arrestin 2 was sequestered into vesicles in 97.0 ± 1.3 and 72.0 ± 11.0% cells for Ang II and SII, respectively.To determine whether the SII-mediated recruitment of β-arrestin 1 in the absence of heterotrimeric G protein coupling would be sufficient to activate RhoA, AT1AR-HEK293 cells were stimulated with 10 μm SII for 5 min and the levels of activated RhoA were determined. SII was able to reproducibly activate RhoA, but the levels of RhoA-GTP were only 5.7 ± 4.5% compared with a maximal stimulation of RhoA-GTP following 100 nm Ang II (Fig. 4, A and B). Additionally, 10 μm SII was incapable of inducing stress fiber formation after 30 min of stimulation (Fig. 4C). However, in the same experiment, SII stimulated the β-arrestin 2-mediated MAPK component ERK1/2 by 35 ± 16% Ang II-stimulated ERK1/2, consistent with previous findings (37Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K.

Post-translational modifications of these proteins have been suggested to modulate membrane mechanical function. Indeed, β-spectrin phosphorylation by casein kinase I has been shown to decrease membrane mechanical stability. However, the effects of the phosphorylation of skeletal proteins by protein kinase C (PKC), a serine/threonine kinase, have not been elucidated. In the present study, we explored the functional consequences of the phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin by PKC. We identified Ser-312 in 4.1R as the PKC phosphorylation site. Using antibodies raised against phosphopeptides of 4.1R and adducin, we documented significant differences in the time course of phosphorylation of adducin and 4.1R by PKC. Although adducin was phosphorylated rapidly by the activation of membrane-bound atypical PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, there was a significant delay in the phosphorylation of 4.1R because of delayed recruitment of conventional PKC from cytosol to the membrane. This differential time course in the phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin in conjunction with membrane mechanical stability measurements enabled us to document that, although phosphorylation of adducin by PKC has little effect on membrane mechanical stability, additional phosphorylation of 4.1R results in a marked decrease in membrane mechanical stability. We further showed that the phosphorylation of 4.1R by PKC results in its decreased ability to form a ternary complex with spectrin and actin as well as dissociation of glycophorin C from the membrane skeleton. These findings have enabled us to define a regulatory role for 4.1R phosphorylation in dynamic regulation of red cell membrane properties.

The maintenance of normal membrane deformability and mechanical stability is critical for human red blood cells to undergo extensive deformations in the microvasculature, which is necessary to perform their function of oxygen delivery during their 120-day life span. The well characterized spectrin-based membrane skeleton, composed of α- and β-spectrin, actin, protein 4.1R (4.1R), adducin, dematin, tropomyosin, and tropomodulin, plays a critical role in regulating membrane mechanical function (1Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). Qualitative and quantitative defects in α- and β-spectrin and 4.1R that lead either to an impaired spectrin-spectrin self-association or to a weakened spectrin-actin-4.1R ternary complex have been shown to result in decreased membrane mechanical stability (2Tse W.T.

A number of studies over the years have documented that skeletal proteins β-spectrin, 4.1R, adducin, and dematin can be phosphorylated by a number of different kinases and are dephosphorylated by various phosphatases (6Boivin P. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Cohen C.M. Gascard P. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 244-292PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies using purified proteins have shown that phosphorylation can alter skeletal protein function (6Boivin P. Biochem.

However, our understanding of how the phosphorylation of various red cell membrane skeletal proteins regulates the mechanical function of intact red cell membranes has not been well defined. In a previous study, we documented that phosphorylation of β-spectrin by casein kinase I decreases the mechanical stability of intact membranes (8Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Nagao K. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 4.1R and adducin form a ternary protein complex with spectrin and actin, and both of them promote the association of spectrin with actin filaments (9Ungewickell E.

Limited chymotryptic digestion of 4.1R generates four distinct polypeptides, the 30-, 16-, 10-, and 22/24-kDa fragments (14Conboy J.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar).

Previous studies (30Ling E. Danilov Y.N. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2209-2216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have documented that in solution, PKA stimulates the incorporation of 32P into Ser-331 and Ser-467 of purified 4.1R but that the phosphorylation of these residues has no effect on the ability of 4.1R to interact with its red cell membrane binding partners. However, phosphorylation of 4.1R by PKC, at a site yet to be defined, decreases the ability of 4.1R to promote spectrin-actin interaction and its ability to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 in inside-out vesicles (IOV) but has no effect on 4.1R binding to GPC (21Danilov Y.N. Fennell R. Ling E. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a subsequent study (31Pinder J.C. Gardner B. Gratzer W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of red blood cells has been shown to result in a decreased association of GPC with the membrane skeleton, suggesting that PKC phosphorylation releases GPC from its skeletal protein-binding partner. The effect of the phosphorylation of 4.1R on the mechanical function of an intact membrane has yet to be defined. Adducin is present as a heterotetramer of α/β subunits in a 1:1 ratio in the red cell (35Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Fowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25534-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Adducin subunits are related in sequence, and all of them contain an N-terminal globular head domain, a neck domain, and a C-terminal protease-sensitive tail domain (36Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tail domain of all adducin subunits ends with a highly conserved 22-residue myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS)-related domain and contains the PKC phosphorylation site. In fact, Ser-726 of α-adducin and Ser-713 of β-adducin have been shown (37Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) to be phosphorylated by PKC in vivo. However, the effect of phosphorylation of adducin on membrane mechanical function has yet to be defined. In the present study, we explored the functional consequences of phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin by PKC on membrane mechanical function. We identified Ser-312 in the 16-kDa domain of 4.1R as the PKC phosphorylation site, using limited proteolytic digestion and peptide sequencing analysis. Using antibodies raised against phosphopeptides of 4.1R and adducin, we documented significant differences in the time course of the phosphorylation of adducin and 4.1R by PKC in intact membranes. Although adducin was phosphorylated rapidly by the PMA-stimulated activation of atypical PKC (aPKC), such as PKCζ, there was a significant delay in the phosphorylation of 4.1R because of the delayed recruitment of conventional PKC (cPKC), such as PKCβ, to the membrane. This differential time course in the phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin in conjunction with membrane mechanical stability measurements enabled us to document that, although the phosphorylation of adducin by PKC has little effect on membrane mechanical stability, the phosphorylation of 4.1R results in a marked decrease in membrane mechanical stability. We further showed that phosphorylated 4.1R (P-4.1R) purified from PMA-treated intact membranes exhibited a decreased ability to form a ternary complex with spectrin and actin and to interact with red cell membrane proteins such as GPC. The findings from the present study enabled us to define a regulatory role for 4.1R phosphorylation in the dynamic regulation of red cell membrane properties. PMA, 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, calyculin A, and anti-GPC antibody were obtained from Sigma. Anti-phosphoserine antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, and phosphoprotein phosphate estimation assay kit were purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc., Dako Cytomation, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan), and Pierce, respectively. Anti-PKC antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-r30-kDa domain of 4.1R (anti-4.1R antibody) was prepared as described previously (39Shimizu Y. Takakuwa Y. Koizumi H. Ishibashi T. Ohkawara S. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Spectrin was purified from erythrocytes as described previously (8Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Nagao K. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and non-muscle actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO). In Vivo Phosphorylation of Erythrocytes with PMA—After obtaining informed consent from healthy volunteer donors, 200 ml of blood was collected from each volunteer in a blood bag containing 28 ml of citrate phosphate dextrose as an anticoagulant. The leukocytes were removed using an IMUGARD III-RC filter (Terumo, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) made of highly porous polyurethane, and erythrocytes were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 g/dl glucose. The erythrocytes were then resuspended at 50% hematocrit in the same buffer. The washed erythrocytes were incubated with Me2SO at a final concentration of 0.2% (control) or 0.02 μm calyculin A dissolved in Me2SO (0.2% final concentration) for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently incubated with Me2SO or 2 μm PMA at 37 °C for varying intervals of time, as indicated. Identification of Phosphorylated Amino Acid of 4.1R—To identify the specific amino acid of 4.1R phosphorylated in intact membranes by PKC, ghosts prepared from erythrocytes treated with or without PMA at 37 °C for 40 min were separated by SDS-PAGE (9% acrylamide), and the 4.1R band was excised and extracted from the gel in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer containing 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4. The isolated 4.1R was subjected to limited digestion with α-chymotrypsin (protein ratio 1:15) on ice, and cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide). The gel was stained for 1 h in Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.1% Coomassie Blue, 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid) followed by destaining (10% methanol, 7% acetic acid). Samples run on duplicate gels were transferred to PVDF membranes electrophoretically and hybridized with an antibody or analyzed for phosphorylated amino acid. Briefly, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the PVDF membrane with 5% bovine serum for 24 h in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20. The blot was then incubated with anti-phosphoserine antibody (1:1000 dilution in TBS containing 2% bovine serum and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h. The blot was washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. The blot was washed several times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with chemiluminescence substrate, and exposed to film to visualize the antibody reactive bands. A second PVDF membrane was stained for 1 min in Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 followed by excising and destaining in 99.5% methanol of the phosphorylated 16-kDa-domain band. The 16-kDa-domain band was sequenced directly by automated Edman degradation (protein peptide sequencer, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Determination of the Extent of Phosphorylation of 4.1R—The P-4.1R was isolated from membranes of erythrocytes treated with PMA. Briefly, the P-4.1R was isolated from ghosts under low ionic conditions (0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) and purified by a Q-Sepharose column (10 × 2.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm KCl in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 (Buffer A). The column was washed with 100 mm KCl in Buffer A, and P-4.1R was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in Buffer A. Each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% acrylamide) and immunoblotting using an anti-4.1R antibody. The P-4.1R fraction was pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4. The amount of phosphorus/P-4.1R was determined using the Phosphoprotein Phosphate Estimation Assay Kit (Pierce) based on the alkaline hydrolysis of phosphate from seryl and threonyl residues in phosphoproteins and then quantifying the released phosphate using malachite green and ammonium molybdate. Lyophilized phosvitin was used as the phosphorylated protein standard. Preparation of Antibodies Specific for Phosphorylated Forms of 4.1R and Adducin—An antibody that specifically recognized 4.1R phosphorylated at Ser-312 (anti-P-4.1R antibody) was produced. Briefly, we synthesized the phosphorylated peptide CAAAQTRAAS(phospho)ALID corresponding to Gln-307–Asp-316 of the 16-kDa domain of 4.1R containing a phosphoserine at Ser-312. The peptide was conjugated via an N-terminal cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antisera were raised in rabbits. Rabbit were given one subcutaneous injection of keyhole limpet hemocyanin peptide (100 μg) in an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. Subsequent injections were given at fortnightly intervals. Animals were bled from the marginal ear vein 10 days after each boost. Serum was recovered from blood after clot retraction and heated to 56 °C for 10 min. The antiphosphorylated adducin antibody (anti-P-adducin antibody) was generated in rabbits using the synthetic adducing peptide CAAAKFRTPS(phospho)FLKKS corresponding to amino acid Lys-721–Ser-731 of human α-adducin or Lys-708–Ser-718 of human β-adducin (36Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The serine residue in this site is conserved between α-adducin (Ser-726) and β-adducin (Ser-713). Measurements of Membrane Mechanical Stability—To measure membrane mechanical stability, resealed ghosts were prepared from erythrocytes with or without PMA treatment in the presence of calyculin A for 5 or 90 min. The ghosts were resuspended in dextran (40,000 Mr, 50% w/v) and examined by the ektacytometer, as described previously (40Bessis N. Mohandas N. Blood Cells. 1977; 3: 209-221Google Scholar, 41Mohandas N. Clark M. Heath B.P. Rossi M. Wolfe L.C. Lux S.E. Shohet S.B. Blood. 1982; 59: 768-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, resealed ghosts were subjected to a constant shear stress of 750 dynes/cm2, and changes in the deformability index (DI) as a function of time were recorded. As ghosts become fragmented and lose membrane surface area, the DI value decreases with time. The rate of decline in DI is a measure of membrane mechanical stability, and the time required for the DI to reach half-maximum value, designated T50, is a quantitative measure of decreased stability. T50 values for membranes with various extents of 4.1R and adducin phosphorylation were determined. Extractability of P-4.1R from Ghosts of PMA-treated Erythrocytes— 4.1R was extracted from ghosts of erythrocytes treated with or without PMA under the low ionic condition (0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). Briefly, erythrocytes pretreated with 0.02 μm calyculin A were subsequently treated with or without PMA at 37 °C for 90 min. Ghosts prepared from these red cells were suspended in 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.5) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cell suspensions were centrifuged for 20 min at 40,000 × g, and the 4.1R associated with the membranes and the extracted 4.1R in the supernatant were analyzed by immunoblotting with both an anti-P-4.1R antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated 4.1R and an anti-4.1R antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated 4.1R. Measurement of 4.1, P-4.1R, and GPC Content of Triton Shells Prepared from PMA-treated Erythrocytes—Erythrocytes were treated with 2 μm PMA for 0, 5, or 90 min at 37 °C. 200 μl of cell suspension was added to 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by incubation for 30 min at 0 °C. The suspension was subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g, and the cell pellet was washed using cold phosphate-buffered saline. The Triton shells were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against 4.1R, P-4.1R, and GPC. Measurement of the Ability of 4.1R and P-4.1R to Form a Ternary Complex with Spectrin and Actin—The ability of 4.1R and P-4.1R to form a ternary complex with spectrin and actin was measured using a co-sedimentation assay with F-actin and purified spectrin from erythrocytes as described previously (25Correas I. Leto T.L. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3310-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). F-actin (12 μm) and spectrin (1.6 μm) were incubated with phosphorylated or unphosphorylated 4.1R (1.7 μm) in binding buffer (130 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 30 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) for 60 min on ice, prior to sedimentation. Samples were applied to a 0.2-ml cushion of 10% sucrose in binding buffer and centrifuged at 0 °C for 150 min at 30,000 × g. Equivalent portions of the supernatant and pellet of the three proteins were analyzed for their contents by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide). Other Analytical Techniques—The protein concentration during the purification of 4.1R, P-4.1R, and spectrin was assayed using the Bradford method (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216261) Google Scholar). Identification of Phosphorylated Amino Acid of 4.1R in Intact Membranes—To initially identify the domain of 4.1R phosphorylated in intact membranes, erythrocytes were incubated with PMA, an activator of PKC, in the presence of calyculin A, a phosphatase inhibitor. The P-4.1R was separated by SDS-PAGE and proteolyzed by α-chymotrypsin. Cleavage products separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane, and phosphorylated peptides were identified by anti-phosphoserine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, only the 16-kDa chymotryptic fragment of 4.1R was phosphorylated by PKC, whereas the chymotryptic fragments corresponding to the other three domains, 30-kDa FERM domain, 10-kDa SAB domain, and the C-terminal 22/24-kDa domains, were not phosphorylated. The consensus sequences identified previously (34Chapline C. Cottom J. Tobin H. Hulmes J. Crabb J. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19482-19489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) for phosphorylation by cPKC (and/or novel PKC) were (K/R)1–3X0–2(S/T)X0–2(R/K)1–3 > (S/T)X0–2(R/K)1–3 > (K/R)1–3X0–2(S/T). There are nine serine residues in the 16-kDa domain, and based on the identified consensus sequences, all nine of the serine residues in the 16-kDa domain potentially can be phosphorylated. To determine which of the serine residues were phosphorylated in intact membranes, we used amino acid sequence analysis. Arg-299 was the first amino acid residue in the 16-kDa domain. As shown in Fig. 1B, the recovery of serine residues from the 16-kDa domain of unphosphorylated 4.1R decreased linearly with increasing cycles. Analysis performed on P-4.1R showed a similar linear decrease in the recovery of various serines except for Ser-312. The recovery of Ser-312 at cycle 14 of P-4.1R was markedly decreased (Fig. 1B), implying that Ser-312 was phosphorylated. For further biochemical characterization, P-4.1R was purified from ghosts prepared from PMA-treated erythrocytes. Although 4.1R cannot be extracted from ghosts prepared from normal erythrocytes under hypotonic condition (0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), surprisingly, almost all of the P-4.1R was extracted from ghosts of PMA-treated erythrocytes under this condition. Isolated P-4.1R was further purified from 4.1R by Q-Sepharose column chromatography with a linear gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in Buffer A. Although 4.1R eluted at 240 mm KCl, the elution of P-4.1R was shifted to 340 mm KCl (data not shown). This finding suggests that P-4.1R is more negatively charged than 4.1R and that phosphorylation may induce a conformational change in 4.1R. Biochemical analysis showed that the phosphate content of P-4.1R isolated under these conditions was 1.3 mol of phosphorous/mol of 4.1R. Thus, it appears that the intrinsic PKC phosphorylates only one site in membrane-associated 4.1R in erythrocytes. To confirm that the phosphorylation site of 4.1R in intact membranes was indeed Ser-312, anti-P-4.1R antibody was made using synthetic peptide (CAAAQ307TRAAS(phospho)-ALID). Although the antibody detected a strong band corresponding to 4.1R in membranes prepared from erythrocytes treated with PMA, it did not detect 4.1R in membranes treated with 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, the inactive phorbol ester (Fig. 2A). This finding strongly supports our conclusion that Ser-312 is the residue in 4.1R that is phosphorylated in vivo by PKC. We also generated an antibody against P-adducin using the corresponding phosphopeptide. As with 4.1R, anti-P-adducin antibody specifically recognized phosphorylated α-adducin and β-adducin but not unphosphorylated adducin (Fig. 2A). Involvement of P-4.1R and P-adducin in Membrane Stability—The time-dependent phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin in intact membranes monitored using the two phosphorylation-specific antibodies is shown in Fig. 2A. Both 4.1R and adducin exhibited a time-dependent increase in the extent of phosphorylation. Interestingly, although phosphorylation of adducin occurred very soon after the addition of PMA, there was a lag phase before the phosphorylation of 4.1R could be documented (Fig. 2B). The observed difference between the kinetics of 4.1R and adducin phosphorylation by PKC suggests that different PKC isoforms may be responsible for the phosphorylation of these two skeletal proteins. PKC is a group of 11 distinct isoforms, and not all isoforms are PMA-inducible. The various isoforms differ in their cofactor requirement, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization. To determine whether the observed differences in the time course of phosphorylation was caused by different PKC isoforms, we probed for the membrane association of PMA-inducible cPKC (such as PKCβ) and aPKC (such as PKCζ). As shown in Fig. 3, aPKC (such as PKCζ) appears to be membrane bound, although there is a significant delay in the recruitment of cPKC (such as PKCβ) to the membrane. Thus, the observed differences between the kinetics of phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin in erythrocyte membranes could be accounted for by the different PKC isoforms responsible for the phosphorylation of these two skeletal proteins, aPKC (such as PKCζ) for adducin and cPKC (such as PKCβ) for 4.1R. To determine the consequences of phosphorylation of 4.1R and/or adducin on membrane mechanical cohesion, we quantitated the membrane mechanical stability of resealed ghosts prepared from erythrocytes treated with PMA for different times. In erythrocytes treated for 5 min in which only adducin was phosphorylated (Fig. 4C), no significant changes in membrane mechanical stability could be documented (Fig. 4A). In erythrocytes treated for 90 min, both 4.1R and adducin were phosphorylated (Fig. 4D), and the membrane mechanical stability was markedly decreased (Fig. 4B). These findings imply that although phosphorylation of adducin by PKC has no effect on membrane mechanical stability, additional phosphorylation of 4.1R decreases the mechanical function of the membrane. PMA dose-dependent increases in the magnitude of 4.1R and adducin phosphorylation and consequent changes in membrane mechanical stability were explored (Fig. 5). Immunoblot analysis with anti P-4.1R and P-adducin antibodies showed that the phosphorylation of adducin reached maximal levels at 0.1 μm, whereas that of 4.1R increased with increasing PMA concentrations, reaching maximal levels at approximately 1.5 μm (Fig. 5A). T50, a measure of membrane mechanical stability, showed a PMA dose-dependent decrease, a 30% decrease in membrane mechanical stability, at 1.5 μm PMA (Fig. 5B). The membrane mechanical stability did not show significant further decreases at higher concentrations of PMA. Importantly, these findings showed an inverse correlation between the PKC phosphorylation of 4.1R and membrane mechanical stability (Fig. 5B). Regulation of 4.1R Binding to Membrane Proteins by Phosphorylation—The effect of phosphorylation on the ability of 4.1R to bind membrane proteins was evaluated by comparing the extractability of 4.1R and P-4.1R from erythrocyte membranes. 4.1R was tightly associated with IOVs prepared from untreated red cells (Fig. 6, lane 2″), and no 4.1R could be detected in the low ionic strength extraction buffer (lane 3″). In marked contrast, P-4.1R was extracted readily from PMA-treated erythrocytes. Little or no 4.1R was associated with IOVs (Fig. 6, lane 5″) but was found mostly in the extraction buffer (lane 6″). Western blotting with antibody specific for phosphorylated 4.1R confirmed that although 4.1R was unphosphorylated in untreated red cells (Fig. 6, lanes 1′), it was phosphorylated in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 6, lane 4′). Interestingly the 4.1R released from PMA-treated erythrocytes was the phosphorylated form (Fig. 6, lane 6′). These findings imply that the phosphorylation of 4.1R significantly reduces the affinity of its interaction with membrane proteins, GPC, and band 3. To obtain further evidence of the effect of 4.1R phosphorylation on its ability to interact with GPC, the amount of GPC retained in Triton shells prepared from erythrocytes treated with 2 μm PMA after 0, 5, and 90 min was quantitated (Fig. 7). Triton shells containing the equivalent amounts of spectrin/actin (Fig. 7, left panel) were examined by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against 4.1R, P-4.1R, and GPC (right panel). Immunoblotting with anti 4.1R antibody that recognizes both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated 4.1R showed that an equivalent amount of 4.1R was associated with spectrin and actin in all three Triton shell preparations. GPC remained associated with Triton shells prepared from untreated membranes and membranes treated for 5 min with PMA in which 4.1R was unphosphorylated. In marked contrast, very little GPC was associated with Triton shells when 4.1R was maximally phosphorylated following a 90-min incubation with PMA. These results imply that the interaction of 4.1R with GPC is reduced dramatically following phosphorylation of 4.1R. Regulation of 4.1R Interaction with Spectrin and Actin by Phosphorylation—The effect of phosphorylation on the ability of 4.1R to form a ternary complex with spectrin and actin was assayed using a pelleting assay. As shown in Fig. 8A, although some spectrin could be pelleted in association with F-actin (lane 4) under the experimental conditions used, the addition of unphosphorylated 4.1R to a mixture of spectrin and actin significantly increased the amount of spectrin pelleted (compare lanes 4 and 5). Interestingly, the ability of P-4.1R to promote spectrin-actin interaction was decreased significantly compared with 4.1R (Fig. 8B). These findings imply that the phosphorylation of 4.1R significantly reduces its ability to form a ternary complex with spectrin and actin. Biochemical and functional studies have documented an important role for the spectrin-based membrane skeleton in regulating erythrocyte membrane mechanical function (1Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, decreased self-association of spectrin dimers resulting from mutations in either α-or β-spectrin and the weakening of spectrin-actin-4.1R interactions caused by mutations in β-spectrin and 4.1R have been shown to decrease membrane mechanical stability (1Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar, 5Takakuwa Y. Tchernia G. Rossi M. Benabadji M. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 78: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Skeletal proteins, β-spectrin, 4.1R, adducin, and dematin can be phosphorylated by a number of different kinases and dephosphorylated by various phosphatases (7Cohen C.M. Gascard P. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 244-292PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies using purified proteins have shown that phosphorylation can alter skeletal protein function (6Boivin P. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Cohen C.M. Gascard P. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 244-292PubMed Google Scholar). However, our understanding of how phosphorylation of various red cell membrane skeletal proteins can regulate mechanical function of intact red cell membranes has not been well defined. A major finding of the present study is the documentation that phosphorylation of 4.1R, but not adducin, by PKC modulates membrane mechanical function. A distinctive feature of the present study design warrants mention. In contrast to earlier studies that relied on the use of [32P]ATP to monitor phosphorylation, we used specific antibodies that recognized only the phosphorylated state of the proteins. The use of these antibodies enabled us to document significant differences in time course of phosphorylation of adducin and 4.1R in intact membranes. The rapid phosphorylation of adducin is the result of activation of membrane-associated aPKC (such as PKCζ) by PMA stimulation, whereas the gradual phosphorylation of 4.1R is caused by the delayed recruitment of cPKC (such as PKCβ) to the membrane. This differential time course between the phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin in conjunction with membrane mechanical stability measurements enabled us to ascertain that although the phosphorylation of adducin alone by PKC has little effect on membrane mechanical stability, the additional phosphorylation of 4.1R results in a marked decrease in membrane mechanical stability. Spectrin-actin interaction is essential for maintaining membrane mechanical stability. In solution, both 4.1R and adducin accentuate spectrin-actin interaction. However, phosphorylation of either 4.1R or adducin by PKC decreases its ability to promote spectrin-actin interaction in vitro (30Ling E. Danilov Y.N. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2209-2216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in intact membranes PKC phosphorylation of only adducin had little effect on membrane mechanical function, whereas phosphorylation of both 4.1R and adducin resulted in decreased membrane mechanical cohesion. This finding suggests that 4.1R phosphorylation in intact membranes destabilizes spectrin-actin interaction, leading to decreased membrane mechanical stability. It should be noted, however, that we could not exclude the possibility that 4.1R and adducin could act cooperatively in regulating membrane mechanical function. Although a number of different serine residues in purified 4.1R are phosphorylated by PKC in solution, only Ser-312 in the 16-kDa domain of 4.1R is phosphorylated in intact membranes. Our biochemical studies showed that 4.1R phosphorylated at Ser-312 exhibits a decreased ability to promote spectrin-actin interaction. Our finding that the interaction between 4.1R and the N-terminal domain of β-spectrin and actin filaments is mediated by the 10-kDa SAB domain implies that the phosphorylation of Ser-312 induces a conformational change in the SAB domain of 4.1R. Interestingly, phosphorylated 4.1R also exhibits decreased affinity for interaction with band 3 and GPC, mediated by its 30-kDa FERM domain, implying a conformational change in this domain as well. Indeed, a conformational change in 4.1R on phosphorylation can be inferred from our finding of differences in the elution profiles of P-4.1R and 4.1R by KCl from Q-Sepharose columns. Taken together, these findings suggest that the 16-kDa domain plays a regulatory role in mediating the functions of 4.1R by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser-312 by PKC and protein phosphatases, respectively. In contrast to our findings, a previous study (42Chang S.H. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22223-22230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) failed to document alterations in membrane mechanical stability following phosphorylation of 4.1R by PKC. The reason for the discrepancy is most likely the result of dephosphorylation of 4.1R during the lysing and resealing of ghosts in the earlier study (42Chang S.H. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22223-22230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In fact, we confirmed that 4.1R is indeed dephosphorylated during processing of the ghosts in the absence of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A. A working model that accounts for our findings is shown in Fig. 9. In the unphosphorylated state, 4.1R interacts with high affinity with the cytoplasmic domain of GPC through its 30-kDa FERM domain and with spectrin and actin through its 10-kDa SAB domain. Phosphorylation of Ser-312 in the 16-kDa domain decreases the affinity of P-4.1R both to GPC and to spectrin and actin. The decreased affinity of the protein-protein interactions by phosphorylation leads to decreased membrane cohesion as manifested by decreased membrane mechanical stability. In addition to the present findings, an earlier study (8Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Nagao K. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) documented that the phosphorylation of β-spectrin by casein kinase I also decreases membrane mechanical stability. Taken together, these findings imply a regulatory role for the phosphorylation of skeletal proteins in the dynamic regulation of erythrocyte membrane properties."
https://openalex.org/W2021073898,"When exposed to genotoxic stress, eukaryotic cells demonstrate a DNA damage response with delay or arrest of cell-cycle progression, providing time for DNA repair. Induction of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic program elicited a cellular DNA damage response, with activation of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) signal transduction pathway. Activation of the ATM-Rad3-related (ATR) replication checkpoint pathway, in contrast, was minimal. The DNA damage sensor Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex and phosphorylated ATM were recruited and retained in viral replication compartments, recognizing newly synthesized viral DNAs as abnormal DNA structures. Phosphorylated p53 also became concentrated in replication compartments and physically interacted with viral BZLF1 protein. Despite the activation of ATM checkpoint signaling, p53-downstream signaling was blocked, with rather high S-phase CDK activity associated with progression of lytic infection. Therefore, although host cells activate ATM checkpoint signaling with response to the lytic viral DNA synthesis, the virus can skillfully evade this host checkpoint security system and actively promote an S-phase-like environment advantageous for viral lytic replication."
https://openalex.org/W2076496694,"The Fn14 gene encodes a type Ia transmembrane protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. We recently showed that fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) is overexpressed in migrating glioma cells in vitro and in glioblastoma multiforme clinical specimens in vivo. To determine the biological role of Fn14 in brain cancer progression, we examined the activity of Fn14 as a potential mediator of cell survival. Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)-stimulated glioma cells had increased cellular resistance to cytotoxic therapy-induced apoptosis. Either TWEAK treatment or Fn14 overexpression in glioma cells resulted in the activation of NFκB and subsequently the translocation of NFκB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In addition, Fn14 activation induced BCL-XL and BCL-W mRNA and protein levels, and this effect was dependent upon NFκB transcriptional activity. Substitution of a putative NFκB binding site identified in the BCL-X promoter significantly decreased Fn14-induced transactivation. Furthermore Fn14-induced transactivation of the BCL-X promoter was also diminished by the super-repressor IκBα mutant, which specifically inhibits NFκB activity, and by mutations in the NFκB binding motif of the BCL-X promoter. Additionally small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of either BCL-XL or BCL-W antagonized the TWEAK protective effect on glioma cells. Our results suggest that NFκB-mediated up-regulation of BCL-XL and BCL-W expression in glioma cells increases cellular resistance to cytotoxic therapy-induced apoptosis. We propose that the Fn14 protein functions, in part, through the NFκB signaling pathway to up-regulate BCL-XL and BCL-W expression to foster malignant glioblastoma cell survival. Targeted therapy against Fn14 as an adjuvant to surgery may improve management of invasive glioma cells and advance the outcome of this devastating cancer. The Fn14 gene encodes a type Ia transmembrane protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. We recently showed that fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) is overexpressed in migrating glioma cells in vitro and in glioblastoma multiforme clinical specimens in vivo. To determine the biological role of Fn14 in brain cancer progression, we examined the activity of Fn14 as a potential mediator of cell survival. Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)-stimulated glioma cells had increased cellular resistance to cytotoxic therapy-induced apoptosis. Either TWEAK treatment or Fn14 overexpression in glioma cells resulted in the activation of NFκB and subsequently the translocation of NFκB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In addition, Fn14 activation induced BCL-XL and BCL-W mRNA and protein levels, and this effect was dependent upon NFκB transcriptional activity. Substitution of a putative NFκB binding site identified in the BCL-X promoter significantly decreased Fn14-induced transactivation. Furthermore Fn14-induced transactivation of the BCL-X promoter was also diminished by the super-repressor IκBα mutant, which specifically inhibits NFκB activity, and by mutations in the NFκB binding motif of the BCL-X promoter. Additionally small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of either BCL-XL or BCL-W antagonized the TWEAK protective effect on glioma cells. Our results suggest that NFκB-mediated up-regulation of BCL-XL and BCL-W expression in glioma cells increases cellular resistance to cytotoxic therapy-induced apoptosis. We propose that the Fn14 protein functions, in part, through the NFκB signaling pathway to up-regulate BCL-XL and BCL-W expression to foster malignant glioblastoma cell survival. Targeted therapy against Fn14 as an adjuvant to surgery may improve management of invasive glioma cells and advance the outcome of this devastating cancer.

In addition, TWEAK binding to Fn14 or overexpression of Fn14 protein promotes nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) pathway activation that may drive the expression of several NFκB-regulated genes (14Brown S.A. Richards C.M. Hanscom H.N. Feng S.L. Winkles J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In fact, the cytoplasmic domain of the Fn14 receptor contains a single TNF receptor-associated factor binding site flanked by two conserved threonine residues (11Wiley S.R. Cassiano L. Lofton T.

TNF receptor-associated factors link transmembrane receptors to the NFκB pathway and several serine/threonine protein kinase cascades, including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, that generally function to promote cellular survival and proliferation (15Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Dysregulated NFκB proteins play a role in malignant transformation by either providing continued positive growth stimuli such as that mediated by cytokines or by inhibiting apoptotic pathways (16Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). NFκB functions as a dimer composed of the RelA (p65) and NFκB1 (p50) or NFκB2 (p52) subunits. In normal resting cells, NFκB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by virtue of binding to IκB (17Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 18Gilmore T.D. Cancer Treat. Res. 2003; 115: 241-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokines such as TNF, interleukin-1, and epidermal growth factor trigger a cascade of signaling events after binding to their transmembrane receptors ultimately leading to the activation of IκB kinase, which phosphorylates IκB at two serine residues, Ser-32/36 (19Rothwarf, D. M., and Karin, M. (1999) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;1999/5/re11Google Scholar, 20Orlowski R.Z. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκB is rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded through the 26 S proteosome pathway, releasing NFκB. Free NFκB translocates to the nucleus and binds to the promoter regions of target genes and activates their transcription (17Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 21Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar). Both BCL-2 and BCL-XL are NFκB-inducible genes. Members of the BCL-2 gene family include the proapoptotic proteins BAD, BIK, and BID and the antiapoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W (22Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). High expression levels of antiapoptotic BCL-2-related proteins have been found in many tumors, and up-regulation of BCL-2 and BCL-XL has been shown to be a key element in malignancy (23Oliver L.

To elaborate the role of Fn14 in glioma pathobiology, we examined Fn14 activation as a potential mechanism by which cell survival is fostered. We showed that TWEAK-stimulated glioma cells had increased cellular resistance to cytotoxic therapy-induced apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated that activation of NFκB by the TWEAK-Fn14 ligand-receptor system underlies the molecular basis for resistance to apoptosis induction in glioma cells. Moreover our data indicated that NFκB protected glioma cells from cytotoxic therapy-induced apoptosis, in part, by up-regulating expression of the BCL-XL and BCL-W proteins.

Briefly monolayers of cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then lysed in 2× SDS sample buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol) containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay procedure (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Thirty micrograms of total cellular protein were loaded per lane, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting at 4 °C. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, with 0.1% Tween 20 prior to addition of primary antibodies and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG (Promega, Madison, WI). Protein bands were identified by chemiluminescence and exposed on X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (33Tran N.L. Adams D.G.

Briefly cells were plated onto 10-well glass slides precoated with 1 μg/ml laminin and then cultured for 24 h. In certain experiments, cells were pretreated for 30 min with either 50 μm SN50 or SN50M (Calbiochem) prior to TWEAK addition. Cells were fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m sucrose for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin and 1% goat serum and incubated with primary antibodies followed by secondary Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG. Cell nuclei were also stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) for 15 min at 37 °C. Immunofluorescent samples were examined under an LSM 5 Pascal laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) or a microscope equipped with a rhodamine filter for Cy3 fluorescence and a 450–490 nm band pass excitation filter and 515 nm long pass emission filter for DAPI fluorescence.

Small Interfering RNA Preparation and Transfection—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides specific for BCL-XL, BCL-W, and GL2 luciferase were designed according to Elbashir et al. (38Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar) and purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The small interfering RNA sequences used were: BCL-XL (xL-1, region 216–236, 5′-CTG CCT AAG GCG GAT TTG AAT; xL-2, region 642–662, 5′-GGC AGG CGA CGA GTT TGA ACT; xL-3, region 816–837, 5′-GTG CGT GGA AAG CGT AGA CAA), BCL-W (w-1, region 608–628, 5′-GGC GGA GTT CAC AGC TCT ATA; w-2, region 1733–1754, 5′-GTG GGC ATA AGT GCT GAT CTA; w-3, region 3289–3310, 5′-CTC GGT CCT GCG ATT ATT AAT), and GL2 luciferase (region 153–173, 5′ AAC GTA CGC GGA ATA CTT CGA TT) as described previously (39Chuang Y.Y. Tran N.L. Rusk N. Nakada M. Berens M.E. Symons M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8271-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNA duplex formation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient transfection of siRNA was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated in a 6-well plate at 2.0 × 105 cells/well in 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum and without antibiotics. Transfections were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol after cells were fully spread (6 h postplating). BCL-XL and BCL-W small interfering RNAs were transfected at 20 nmol/liter. No cell toxicity was observed at 20 nmol/liter siRNA. Using quantitative PCR, we verified that the siRNA oligos to BCL-XL and BCL-W specifically inhibited the expression of BCL-XL and BCL-W, respectively, but not other members of the BCL-2 family (i.e. BCL-2 and BAX). Maximum inhibition was achieved by day 2–3 after transfection, and cells were assayed at day 3 or 4 post-transfection. Apoptosis Assays—Apoptotic cells were evaluated by nuclear morphology of DAPI-stained cells as described previously (40Joy A.M. Beaudry C.E. Tran N.L. Ponce F.A. Holz D.R. Demuth T. Berens M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly cells with condensed, fragmented chromatin were manually scored as apoptotic cells. At least five fields (total of 1000 cells) were evaluated, and data are reported as apoptotic cells/total cells × 100. Verification of apoptotic cells was conducted by co-immunofluorescence staining using a monoclonal antibody against activated cleaved caspase 3 (Promega). At least 1000 cells per treatment were evaluated for condensed chromatin and activated caspase 3. In addition, nuclear PARP proteolytic cleavage was assessed by immunoblotting analysis of cellular lysates as described above using antibodies recognizing both the intact (116-kDa) and proteolytic (85-kDa) forms of PARP. In certain experiments, TWEAK (100 ng/ml) was preincubated with Fn14-Fc decoy receptor (2.5 μg/ml) or control mouse IgG as described previously (7Donohue P.J. Richards C.M. Brown S.A. Hanscom H.N.

Transfection and Dual Luciferase Reporter Assays—Dual luciferase reporter assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). Cells were plated in a 24-well tissue culture dish and then incubated in normal growth medium for 24–48 h until 70% confluency was reached. Cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of 3× tandem NFκB luciferase reporter gene (Clontech), BCL-X promoter/luciferase reporter gene pGL2(848) or mutant pGL2κBM (41Tsukahara T. Kannagi M.

Virol. 1999; 73: 7981-7987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or pGL basic promoter/enhancerless luciferase reporter gene (Promega) using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). In some cases, cells were co-transfected with pCMV-IκBαM or control pcDNA3.1 (1 μg). As an internal standard, all plasmids were co-transfected with 50 ng of pRL-TK (Promega), which contains the Renilla luciferase gene. At 6 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum. In certain experiments cells were either treated with 100 ng/ml TWEAK or infected with adenoviruses expressing Fn14wt, Fn14tCT, or LacZ. All cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in passive lysis buffer. All treatments were done in triplicate for each experiment. Luciferase activity was measured using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnydale, CA) and normalized against the activity of the Renilla luciferase gene for differences in transfection efficiency. The results were expressed as relative light units of luciferase activity to Renilla activity.

https://openalex.org/W2047609920,"S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) denitrosation activity of recombinant human protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) has been kinetically characterized by monitoring the loss of the S–NO absorbance, using a NO electrode, and with the aid of the fluorogenic NOx probe 2,3-diaminonaphthalene. The initial rates of denitrosation as a function of [GSNO] displayed hyperbolic behavior irrespective of the method used to monitor denitrosation. The Km values estimated for GSNO were 65 ± 5 μm and 40 ± 10 μm for the loss in the S–NO bond and NO production (NO electrode or 2,3-diaminonaphthalene), respectively. Hemoglobin assay provided additional evidence that the final product of PDI-dependent GSNO denitrosation was NO·. A catalytic mechanism, involving a nitroxyl disulfide intermediate stabilized by imidazole (His160a-domain or His589a′-domain), which after undergoing a one-electron oxidation decomposes to yield NO plus dithiyl radical, has been proposed. Evidence for the formation of thiyl/dithiyl radicals during PDI-catalyzed denitrosation was obtained with 4-((9-acridinecarbonyl)-amino)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl. Evidence has also been obtained showing that in a NO- and O2-rich environment, PDI can form N2O3 in its hydrophobic domains. This “NO-charged PDI” can perform intra- and intermolecular S-nitrosation reactions similar to that proposed for serum albumin. Interestingly, reduced PDI was able to denitrosate S-nitrosated PDI (PDI-SNO) resulting in the release of NO. PDI-SNO, once formed, is stable at room temperature in the absence of reducing agent over the period of 2 h. It has been established that PDI is continuously secreted from cells that are net producers of NO-like endothelial cells. The present demonstration that PDI can be S-nitrosated and that PDI-SNO can be denitrosated by PDI suggests that this enzyme could be intimately involved in the transport of intracellular NO equivalents to the cell surface as well as the previous demonstration of PDI in the transfer of S-nitrosothiol-bound NO to the cytosol.

Epstein C.J. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 628-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although large levels of this enzyme are found in the endoplasmic reticulum, PDI is secreted from cells in which it associates electrostatically with the cell surface (2Zai A. Rudd A.M. Scribner A.W. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 3Terada K. Manchikalapadi P. Noiva R. Jauregui H.O. Stockert R.J. Schilsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20410-20416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). One of the most studied functions of PDI is its ability to catalyze isomerization and rearrangement of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum, contributing to a proper folding of nascent proteins (4Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface PDI was initially discovered in platelets (5Chen K. Detwiler T.C. Essex D.V. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), in which it plays a dual role in integrin-mediated adhesion and aggregation (6Lahav J. Gofer-Dadosh N. Luboshitz J. Hess O. Shaklai M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7Essex D.V. Li M. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 104: 448-454Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), RSNO-mediated platelet inhibition, and GSNO denitrosation (8Root P. Sliskovic I. Mutus B. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosothiols (RSNOs) are known nitric oxide (NO) donors. RSNOs range in size from low molecular weight, such as cysteine-NO and homocysteine-NO, to high molecular weight nitrosated proteins, such as serum albumin-NO. They are known to prolong NO half-life (9Girard P. Potier P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 7-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and to act as a NO transport system in a cellular environment (10Jourd'heuil D. Hallen K. Feelisch M. Grisham M.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Noble D.R. Williams D.C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 2001; 2: 13-17Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 12Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 99: 5913-5918Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An additional novel activity of PDI is its ability to denitrosate RSNOs. On the cell surface, the RSNO denitrosation activity of PDI has been shown to play a role in the transfer of S-nitrosothiol-bound NO into cytosol (2Zai A. Rudd A.M. Scribner A.W. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Ramachandran N. Root P. Jiang X. Hogg P.J. Mutus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated because the RSNO denitrosation activity of PDI has not been well characterized. Here this was accomplished by directly monitoring the PDI-dependent loss in the S–NO bond via a NO electrode and the fluorogenic NOx and GS· probes. Recently it has been shown that PDI has copper binding activity (14Narindrasorasak S. Yao P. Sarkar B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that PDI-bound copper does not play a role in the denitrosation activity of PDI. We have also shown that the PDI stores the NO released from RSNOs, probably in the form of N2O3 (12Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 99: 5913-5918Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and can transfer it to intra- and intermolecular thiols. These significant findings could implicate PDI in both efflux and influx of RSNO-bound NO. Materials—Bovine serum albumin, reduced and oxidized glutathione, N-ethylmaleimide, diethylamine NONOate sodium salt, dithiothreitol (DTT), EDTA, diaminonaphthalene (DAN), neocuproine, sodium hydroxide, copper (II) sulfate, ammonium sulfamate, Sephadex G-25, and human hemoglobin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 4-((9-Acridinecarbonyl)-amino)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Ac-Tempo) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bradford reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad. Purification of Protein Disulfide Isomerase—Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and expression vector pET-28a were used for expression of recombinant human PDI. The plasmid encodes a fusion protein containing the entire human PDI sequence with an N-terminal His6 tag (15Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllyla R. Huhtala M.L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant PDI from the soluble fraction of cell lysate was done using Ni-CAM™ HC Resin (Sigma), a high capacity nickel affinity matrix. PDI bound to the resin was eluted using 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and was collected in 2.0-ml fractions. The fractions containing PDI were pooled and dialyzed against 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Protein quantification was performed using the Bradford assay (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The purity of protein was ascertained by gel electrophoresis and Western blot. PDI Assay Buffer—PDI assay buffer contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 2 mm EDTA. This buffer was used throughout the study unless otherwise specified. Synthesis of S-Nitrosoglutathione—Prior to synthesis of S-nitrosoglutathione, [free thiol] in the GSH was determined with DTNB (17Jiang X.M. Fitzgerald M. Grant C.M. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 393-399Google Scholar). A stoichiometric amount of acidified NaNO2 was reacted for 30 min. at 4 °C. Upon reaction completion, the pH of the solution was then adjusted to 7.4. Lastly, GSNO was recrystallized by the slow addition of ice-cold acetone and was resuspended in the appropriate buffer. Preparation of Oxyhemoglobin and Methemoglobin—Oxyhemoglobin was prepared by reduction of human hemoglobin with dithionite in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, followed by chromatographic separation on Sephadex G-25 using the same buffer. Methemoglobin was prepared by oxidizing human hemoglobin with 5% excess of potassium ferricyanide in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, followed by chromatographic separation of unreacted species using Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with the same buffer. Oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin were prepared fresh prior to each experiment. Hemoglobin Assay—The final product of GSNO cleavage by PDI was examined using the hemoglobin assay (18Arnelle J.S. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Oxyhemoglobin assay is used to detect NO·, which serves as an oxidizing agent thereby converting oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin (19Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 20Bazylinski D.A. Hollocher T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 79828-79860Google Scholar). The reaction is accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 542 and 580 nm and an increase at 630 nm, indicative of methemoglobin formation. The reaction mixture contained 30 μm oxyhemoglobin, 1.2 mm GSH, 100 μm GSNO (blank), and 2 μm PDI (sample), in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA. NO– generation was monitored by methemoglobin reduction to oxyhemoglobin and subsequent increase in 542 and 580 nm accompanied by a decrease in 630 nm. Assay solution contained 30 μm methemoglobin, 1.2 mm GSH, 100 μm GSNO (blank), and 2 μm PDI (sample), in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, including 1 mm EDTA. All spectra were recorded from 500 to 700 nm at specified time intervals. The extinction coefficient for oxyhemoglobin at pH 7.0 is 13,900 m–1 cm–1 and 14,400 m–1 cm–1 at 542 and 580 nm, respectively, whereas the GSNO extinction coefficient at 545 nm is 15 m–1 cm–1 (21Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and is therefore considered insignificant. All measurements were performed using Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Direct Monitoring of PDI Denitrosation Activity with UV-visible Spectroscopy—The denitrosation activity of PDI was determined by monitoring the changes in absorption of GSNO (340 nm) as a function of time with different reducing agents. The reaction was performed in PDI assay buffer containing 100 μm GSNO and 3 μm PDI with varying concentrations of GSH (25 μm to 10 mm) to determine the ideal GSH concentration for optimizing GSNO denitrosation. The activity was also monitored with a fixed concentration of GSH (1.2 mm) and varying concentrations of GSNO (10–500 μm) to estimate its Km. All measurements were performed using a Bio-tek Instruments ELX 808ru Ultra microplate reader and Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Detection of PDI Radicals with Ac-Tempo—According to previous reports, Ac-Tempo, a paramagnetic nonfluorescent conjugate of nitroxide and acridine, interacts with glutathionyl radicals resulting in increased fluorescence of the acridine moiety of Ac-Tempo (22Schwaller M. Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ac-Tempo concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 359 nm (ϵ = 10.4 mm–1 cm–1) using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were recorded on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer, with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 440 nm, respectively. PDI radical formation was detected by mixing stoichiometric amounts of PDI and GSNO (2 μM) with Ac-Tempo (10 μm) followed by a time-based measurement of radical generation. The possibility of Ac-Tempo reacting with GS· coming from GSNO was eliminated by separate experiments that used DTT and GSH as reducing agents (data not shown). Also, additional evidence that PDI is responsible for GSNO denitrosation that results in PDI radical formation was conducted with the use of BSA (2 μm) instead of PDI. The standard plot of free radical formation was constructed by photolysis (355 nm) using an Applied Photophysics Laser Flash photolysis spectrometer; varying concentrations of GSNO (1–20 μm) were photolyzed for 40 s in the presence of Ac-Tempo, and the fluorescence was observed at 440 nm (excitation 360 nm). The standard plot was generated and used for thiyl/dithiyl radical quantification whenever required. Generation of a Standard Curve with DAN—Varying concentrations of GSNO (200 nm to 25 μm) were incubated with DAN (200 μm) and HgCl2 (100 μm) for 10 min in PBS (0.1 mm, pH 7.4) at room temperature. The fluorescence readings were taken at 415 nm (λex, 375 nm). The quantification of released NOx, when required, was estimated using this standard curve. Demonstration of the Ability of BSA and PDI to Store NO—25 μm GSNO was incubated with 100 μm HgCl2 for 10 min in the presence of 1, 2, and 4 μm BSA or PDI followed by the addition of ammonium sulfamate (0.1%) to remove the excess of HNO2. DAN (200 μm) was then added, and the fluorescence was monitored as a function of time at 415 nm (λex, 375 nm). The experiments were performed in 0.1 mm PBS buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Preparation of PDI-reduced and S-Nitrosated PDI (PDI-SNO)—PDI was treated with 10-fold molar excess of DTT for 30 min at room temperature and dialyzed overnight in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, at 4 °C. The concentration of free thiols was measured with DTNB (17Jiang X.M. Fitzgerald M. Grant C.M. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 393-399Google Scholar). PDI-NO was prepared by incubating reduced PDI with 5-fold molar excess of DEA-NO for 30 min at room temperature. The NO concentration was determined by NO meter using HgCl2 (23Borisenko G.G. Martin I. Zhao Q. Amoscato A.A. Kagan V.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 9221-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as described below. Nitric Oxide Determinations Using NO Meter—Soluble nitric oxide was measured using the ISO-NO Mark II equipped with WPI MKII NO electrode. A standard curve for NO was generated by adding GSNO (10–100 μm) to 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm HgCl2. PDI-NO (1.0 μm) was placed in the vial containing 0.1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the electrode was blanked using this mixture. At 20 s, 100 μm HgCl2 was added, and the NO generation was monitored until NO was no longer detected. In the parallel experiment, 2.0 μm PDI-reduced was added to PDI-NO to verify whether PDI alone could act upon PDI-NO. In a control experiment, BSA (2.0 μm), used instead of reduced PDI, did not result in NO generation (data not shown). To demonstrate the involvement of the active-site thiols, NEM-blocked PDI was incubated with DEA-NO for 30 min at room temperature, generating NO-saturated PDI. 3.0 μm of this NO-saturated PDI was placed in the vial containing 0.1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the current was measured for 2 min. At 40 s, 100 μm HgCl2 was added to remove any S–NO present in the sample. Finally, at 130 s, 500 μm GSH was added to potentially scavenge N2O3 postulated to be present in hydrophobic domains of PDI. Also, this experiment was preformed in the reverse order by first adding GSH (500 μm) followed by the addition of HgCl2 (100 μm). The control was obtained in a similar way, using NEM-blocked PDI without exposure to DEA-NO. Actual NO concentration was determined from the standard curve. The control was obtained in a similar manner, using the buffer without PDI. Quantification of Thiols in PDI—10 μm PDI was incubated with 10 mm DTT for 1 h and then separated through a G-25 column. 1.2 μm PDI was then incubated with DTNB for 30 min at different time intervals, and absorbance was monitored at 412 nm in 100 mm Tris-HCL buffer, pH 8 (ϵ = 13900 m–1 cm–1 at 412 nm). Monitoring PDI-SNO Formation by UV-visible Spectroscopy— Freshly isolated native PDI (10 μm) was treated with DEA-NO for 30 min and then separated through a G-25 column. The absorption spectrum of PDI-SNO was then monitored between 300 and 450 nm. The NO was removed by adding Hg to the above solution, and the quantification of S-nitrosation was done at 340 nm by taking the molar extinction coefficient of 980 m–1 cm–1. The Effect of GSH on PDI Denitrosation Activity—It is well established that free thiols like dithiothreitol (13Ramachandran N. Root P. Jiang X. Hogg P.J. Mutus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Grey W.R. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. 2nd Ed.

Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) are required to maintain the thiol-disulfide exchange activity of PDI. The same is true for the PDI RSNO denitrosation activity because denitrosation was not observed in the absence of free thiols. In an attempt to determine the ideal RSNO/RSH ratio for maximal PDI denitrosation activity, the denitrosation of a constant amount of GSNO (100 μm) was monitored as a function of [GSH] in the presence and absence of PDI (Fig. 1A). The largest enzymatic rate/blank rate ratio (∼6) was obtained with 1.2 mm GSH. This concentration of GSH was subsequently used in the Km estimations. Interestingly, no enzymatic denitrosation was observed when DTT or homocysteine was the reducing agent (data not shown). Kinetic Characterization of PDI-catalyzed RSNO Denitrosation—The initial rates of denitrosation were monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm for the loss of S–NO absorbance with 3 μm human recombinant PDI and 1.2 mm GSH as a function of [GSNO] (10–500 μm). Initial rates versus [GSNO] data were well accommodated with the Michealis-Menten equation and the apparent Km estimated for GSNO was 65 ± 5 μm (Fig. 1B). PDI (2 μm) denitrosation activity was also monitored by NO electrode by means of measuring NO released from GSNO (10–140 μm), and the apparent Km was estimated to be 40 ± 10 μm (Fig. 1C). The slightly higher Km observed spectrophotometrically is likely due to uncertainty in the initial denitrosation rates at low GSNO concentrations because of the low extinction coefficient of the S–NO bond at 340 nm (ϵ = 980 m–1 cm–1). The end product of PDI-dependent GSNO denitrosation could be either NO– or NO·. To this end, hemoglobin assay was performed (18Arnelle J.S. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) for identifying the actual product of PDI denitrosation activity. Upon incubation of oxyhemoglobin with GSNO, GSH, and PDI, a time-dependent decrease at 542 and 580 nm and an increase at 630 nm indicated methhemoglobin formation, suggesting that the major product of reaction was NO· (Fig. 2). To eliminate the possibility that NO– was produced, which can under certain circumstances be converted to NO·, we did a methemoglobin assay with PDI and GSNO (data not shown). If NO– were produced, it would reduce methhemoglobin that could be monitored by an increase in absorbance at 540 nm and 580 nm accompanied by a decrease at 630 nm. Because methemoglobin spectra in the presence of PDI and GSNO were stable for over 20 min, the amount of NO– possibly being produced was below the detection limit. PDI Radical Formation as a Result of GSNO Denitrosation—To obtain additional evidence for the catalytic mechanism of PDI denitrosation activity, a nonfluorescent thiyl radical probe, Ac-Tempo, was used. Previous studies have shown that Ac-Tempo, upon interacting with thiyl radicals, produces a fluorescent signal. Here we set out to determine whether PDI would form a thiyl radical in its active site as a result of GSNO denitrosation. First, GSNO was added to Ac-Tempo alone. The lack of fluorescent product formation (Fig. 3B, triangles) suggested that there is no spontaneous interaction between a probe and GSNO. However, when equimolar (2 μm) PDI plus GSNO were added to Ac-Tempo (10 μm), a continuous, time-dependent increase in fluorescence was observed. The rate of thiyl radical formation (Fig. 3A, squares) closely paralleled NO production upon the mixing of equimolar (2 μm) PDI and GSNO, detected by the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin (Fig. 3A, diamonds). A comparison of the NO and thiyl/dithiyl stoichiometry indicated that 0.8 ± 0.12 mol NO was produced per 3.0 ± 0.43 mol thiyl/dithiyl radical formed. In control experiments, in which BSA was used instead of PDI, no thiyl radical was detected (Fig. 3B, filled circles). Also, GSNO in the presence of a reducing agent GSH did not result in a change in signal upon PDI addition. PDI and BSA Act as a NO Sink—Nudler and co-workers (12Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 99: 5913-5918Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Nedospasov A. Rafikov R. Beda N. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that hydrophobic domains of proteins like serum albumin can accumulate NO and O2 with which they react to form the potent S-nitrosating agent N2O3. Here we used DAN to test whether PDI could also perform a similar function. The amino group of DAN gets N-nitrosated by NO as well as by other oxides of nitrogen including NO–2 and N2O3 (30Kleinhenz D.J. Fan X. Rubin J. Hart C.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Wink D.A. Kim S. Coffin D. Cook J.C. Vodovotz Y. Chistodoulou D. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The second amino group of DAN then reacts with nitrosated intermediate, yielding the highly fluorescent naphthotriazole derivative. Here 50 μm GSNO was incubated with HgCl2 (32Williams D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 299-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to release NO in the presence of 1, 2, and 4 μm BSA (Fig. 4A) or PDI (Fig. 4B). With both PDI and BSA, the amount of naphthotriazole production, a direct indication of available soluble NOx, decreased with increasing [protein] (BSA or PDI). Many studies indicate that NO and O2 hydrophobic molecules concentrate in hydrophobic loci of biological milieus and react to produce the highly reactive nitrosating agent N2O3 (12Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 99: 5913-5918Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Nedospasov A. Rafikov R. Beda N. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nudler and co-workers (12Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 99: 5913-5918Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have shown that the accumulated N2O3 in the hydrophobic pockets of BSA could nitrosate thiols. In the present case, the most likely candidate for S-nitrosation would be the active site thiols of PDI itself. The next question we asked was whether PDI-SNO could be denitrosated by metals and another PDI. For these experiments, a NO electrode was used as a direct method for measuring soluble [NO] (35Pfeiffer S. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Zhang X. Cardosa L. Broderick M. Fein H. Davies I.R. Electroanalysis. 2000; 12: 425-428Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PDI Can Release NO from PDI-SNO—In these experiments, a NO electrode was placed in the buffer containing NO-saturated PDI (1.0 μm) (Fig. 5, A and B), and the current was monitored for 20 s to ensure that there was not a spontaneous generation of NO occurring. At 20 s, HgCl2 (100 μm) was added. This resulted in an instantaneous increase in current that corresponded to [NO] of 4 ± 0.5 μm/1.0 μm PDI (Fig. 5A). A similar experiment was performed, using PDI (2 μm) instead of HgCl2. This also resulted in an increase in current corresponding to 4 ± 0.5 μm NO (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the possible NO released from PDI-SNO was determined to be ∼4.5 μm NO/∼1.0 μm PDI, under our experimental conditions. To further investigate the possibility that PDI is able to store NO in the form of N2O3 in its hydrophobic pockets (12Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 99: 5913-5918Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we incubated NEM-blocked PDI with DEA-NO. This method ensured that there is no PDI-SNO formation. Upon addition of 100 μm HgCl2 to NEM-blocked NO-saturated PDI, no change in current was observed. However, when 100 μm GSH was added to the sample, a slower increase of current was observed (Fig. 5C, dotted line), and the concentration of NO generated was found to be ∼10 ± 1 μm NO/1.0 μm PDI. The interpretation of these results is that in PDI that has its thiols blocked with NEM, intramolecular S–N=O cannot be formed. Therefore NO generated in the presence of HgCl2 (Fig. 5C) is coming from GSNO that is formed from the reaction between N2O3 in NEM-PDI hydrophobic domains with added GSH. Addition of GSH in NEM-blocked PDI not exposed to DEA-NO (data not shown) did not produce any NO, supporting our interpretation. The same experiment was preformed in the reverse order. Upon adding GSH to NEM-blocked PDI previously exposed to DEA-NO, no NO generation was observed (Fig. 5C, thick line). However, upon adding HgCl2, NO release was observed. The stability of PDI thiols was tested by first fully reducing it and then monitoring the thiol decay at room temperature by DTNB assay (Fig. 6A). It was observed that almost ∼50% of the thiols were reoxidized in 2.5–3 h. Freshly purified PDI was also found to have 50–60% reduced thiols. When freshly purified PDI was nitrosated by DEA-NO and then separated by G-25 column, it showed a peak at ∼340 nm (Fig. 6B, dark line). The peak disappeared after the addition of 100 μm Hg (Fig. 6B, dashed line). The corrected spectrum showed 50% PDI nitrosation (Fig. 6B, inset). To compare the activity of native PDI and PDI-SNO, the insulin turbidity method was employed. The assay was performed in the absence of any reducing agent. Whereas native PDI was found to be active for one turnover, no activity was observed with PDI-SNO (data not shown). PDI-SNO, once formed, was fairly stable for more than 2.5 h and could be denitrosated by DTT (data not shown). The S-denitrosation activity of PDI, although demonstrated in several studies (2Zai A. Rudd A.M. Scribner A.W. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Ramachandran N. Root P. Jiang X. Hogg P.J. Mutus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), has not been well characterized. Here we set out to kinetically analyze the GSNO denitrosation activity of human recombinant PDI. It has been well established that PDI requires thiol reductants to perform its thiol-disulfide exchange activity (37Essex D.W. Miller A. Swiatkowska M. Frienman R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10398-10405Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that the GSNO denitrosation activity probed here was also dependent on thiol-reducing agents. GSH turned out to be the best reducing agent when the loss in the S–NO bond absorbance at 343 nm was used to monitor the denitrosation. However, no significant denitrosation was observed when DTT or homocysteine was used as reducing agent (data not shown). This suggests that PDI denitrosation activity is specific to the presence of glutathione, which is the primary reducing agent in the cell with a concentration of >1 mm (38Pastore A. Federici G. Bertini E. Piemonte F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2003; 333: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The PDI-dependent denitrosation reaction as a function of [GSNO] was probed via three independent methods: directly via the loss of the S–NO bond absorbance at 340 nm, directly by NO production via the NO electrode, or indirectly with DAN as we have reported earlier (39Raturi A. Mutus B. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Km for GSNO estimated by spectrophotometric method was found to be ∼ 65 ± 5 μm (Fig. 1B), whereas the NO meter and DAN assays (39Raturi A. Mutus B. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) gave a value of 40 ± 10 μm (Fig. 1C) and 65 ± 5 μm, respectively. Before proceeding further, we set out to determine the final product of GSNO denitrosation by PDI. Hemoglobin assay (Fig. 2) showed that it is NO· and not NO– being formed during the GSNO denitrosation by PDI, which is in agreement with a previous study presented on GSNO denitrosation (40Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). On the basis of results obtained, we propose the PDI denitrosation mechanism as shown in Scheme 1. In this mechanism, one of the vicinal thiols (Scheme 1, I) in the CXXC sequence of PDI active site undergoes a transnitrosation reaction with the RSNO substrate (Scheme 1, II). The second active site cysteine then attacks the nitrogen of the S–N=O yielding a nitroxyl disulfide intermediate (Scheme 1, III). The formation of this intermediate could be facilitated via delocalization of electrons in N=O to yield N–O, which could be stabilized via a positively charged side chain in the vicinity of the active site, such as His160 in the a-domain or His589 in the a′-domain (GenBank™ accession number AK027647). A one-electron oxidation results in the formation of nitroxyl disulfide radical (Scheme 1, IV), which could rearrange to yield an oxidized (–S–S–) PDI active site plus NO· (Scheme 1, V and VI). The formation of such a nitroxyl disulfide intermediate was proposed by Houk et al. in a recent computational study (41Houk K.N. Hietbrink B.N. Bartberger M.D. McCarren P.R. Choi B.Y. Voyksner R.D. Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6972-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In order for this mechanism to work, there is a requirement for an electron acceptor which could be the oxidized active site thiols of PDI dimer in the antiparallel arrangement as proposed by Solovyov and Gilbert (42Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1902-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In support of this, it has been reported that PDI active site is the most oxidative (–180 mV) (43Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) of all other members of thioredoxin-like family. In addition, it has been reported that oxidized active site thiols in DsbD (PDI-like protein) can serve as electron transporter (44Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 45Collet J.-F. Riemer J. Bader M.W. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26886-26892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It was further proposed that flow of electrons within DsbD occurs via succession of disulfide exchange reactions (44Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for thiyl radical production was obtained with the Ac-Tempo probe. When equimolar GSNO was mixed with PDI, thiyl/dithiyl radicals were generated (Fig. 3) supporting the proposed mechanism. In contrast, GSNO alone or BSA used instead of PDI did not result in production of radicals (Fig. 3B), nor did PDI and GSNO in the presence of GSH, which would reduce the thiyl/dithiyl radicals. In further support of the proposed mechanism, the rate of thiyl/dithiyl radical formation paralleled NO formation. The estimated stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that 3 mol of thiyl/dithiyl radical is formed per 1 mol of NO. This stoichiometry is well accommodated by Scheme 1, suggesting that the two active sites S· plus the S–S· (i.e. 3 mol of thiyl/dithiyl) plus 1 mol of NO· (Scheme 1, IV and V) form in a concerted manner rather than sequentially. The next question we asked was where does the NO released by PDI from GSNO go? The experimental evidence presented here suggests that the released NO accumulates in the PDI hydrophobic domains and is converted to N2O3. Nudler and co-workers (12Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 99: 5913-5918Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Nedospasov A. Rafikov R. Beda N. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that proteins like serum albumin can S-nitrosate proteins by acting as sinks for NO and O2 in their hydrophobic domains in which these molecules can efficiently react to produce N2O3, a potent nitrosating agent. Here we were able to show this using the NOx-specific reagent DAN. In this case, increasing amounts of both BSA (Fig. 4A) and PDI (Fig. 4B) were able to decrease the amount of NO released from GSNO by Hg2+. These results indicated that PDI, like BSA (12Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 99: 5913-5918Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Nedospasov A. Rafikov R. Beda N. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), can act as a NO sink. These low yields could potentially be the result of such a tendency of PDI to get oxidized or of the PDI active site thiols to be oxidized during protein manipulation. To verify this, the stability of reduced PDI was tested with DTNB assay. It was observed that almost half-of the reduced PDI was reoxidized within 2 h (Fig. 6) after which it remained fairly stable. Furthermore, upon exposure of native PDI to DEA-NO, all of the free thiols of PDI could be nitrosated. Interestingly, when HgCl2 or PDI was added to this fully S-nitrosated PDI-SNO, ∼50% of the S–NO was rapidly released as NO (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). We further confirmed that active site thiols of PDI were essential for the release of NO from DEA-NO-exposed PDI. In these experiments, the free thiols of PDI were blocked with NEM. When PDI-NEM was exposed to DEA-NO and NO production was monitored in the presence of HgCl2, NO release was not observed. However, NO was released when thiols in the form of GSH was introduced to this mixture (Fig. 5C, dotted line). Support for this observation was obtained by changing the order of GSH addition. When GSH was added first, there was no change in the signal. However, upon addition of HgCl2 rapid NO generation was observed, followed by time-dependent decay. In conclusion, the results presented here have very important implications with respect to the role of PDI in the transport of NO equivalents from NO-producing cells to the serum and in the release of NO from RSNOs. Our results show that PDI denitrosates GSNO when NO levels are low, as is the case on the cell surface. However, in the presence of large amounts of generated NO, as in the intracellular environment of endothelial cells, PDI becomes a NO carrier via an N2O3-mediated auto-S-nitrosation of its active site thiols. Because PDI is continuously excreted, this might be an important route for the transport of intracellular NO equivalents to the serum. Once excreted, PDI-SNO can be denitrosated by PDI yielding NO on the cell surfaces of endothelial cells and platelets. This could be a cyclic process because it has been speculated that excreted PDI may be recycled back into intracellular environment (3Terada K. Manchikalapadi P. Noiva R. Jauregui H.O. Stockert R.J.

Its tRNA is variably methylated on the 2′-O-hydroxyl site of the ribosyl moiety at position 34 (Um34). Herein, we identified a role of Um34 in regulating the expression of some, but not all, selenoproteins. A strain of knock-out transgenic mice was generated, wherein the Sec tRNA gene was replaced with either wild type or mutant Sec tRNA transgenes. The mutant transgene yielded a tRNA that lacked two base modifications, N6-isopentenyladenosine at position 37 (i6A37) and Um34. Several selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidases 1 and 3, SelR, and SelT, were not detected in mice rescued with the mutant transgene, whereas other selenoproteins, including thioredoxin reductases 1 and 3 and glutathione peroxidase 4, were expressed in normal or reduced levels. Northern blot analysis suggested that other selenoproteins (e.g. SelW) were also poorly expressed. This novel regulation of protein expression occurred at the level of translation and manifested a tissue-specific pattern. The available data suggest that the Um34 modification has greater influence than the i6A37 modification in regulating the expression of various mammalian selenoproteins and Um34 is required for synthesis of several members of this protein class. Many proteins that were poorly rescued appear to be involved in responses to stress, and their expression is also highly dependent on selenium in the diet.

Hatfield D.L. Selenium: Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2001: 7-22Crossref Google Scholar). In mammals, the mechanism of Sec insertion into protein is not as completely understood (reviewed in Refs. 2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell.

However, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes use the stop codon, UGA, to dictate the incorporation of Sec after the tRNA is initially aminoacylated with serine, and the biosynthesis of Sec occurs on its tRNA. The tRNA has therefore been designated Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec (2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The presence of a stem-loop structure that occurs downstream of UGA in selenoprotein mRNA, known as a Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element (4Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), is responsible for dictating UGA as Sec instead of the cessation of protein synthesis. In mammals, a specific SECIS-binding protein, designated SECIS-binding protein 2 (5Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), recognizes the SECIS element, and a specific elongation factor, designated EFsec (6Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.M.

Nutr. 2003; 23: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).In higher vertebrates, there are two Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec isoforms that differ from each other by a single nucleoside modification at position 34, which is the wobble position of the anticodon (2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). One isoform contains methylcarboxylmethyluridine (mcm5U) at this site, and the other contains methylcarboxymethyluridine-2′-O-methylribose (mcm5Um). Several lines of evidence suggest that methylation of the ribosyl moiety at the 2′-O-hydroxyl site (designated Um34) is a highly specialized event. It is the last step in the maturation of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec. This modification step is dependent on the prior synthesis of the four modified bases found in Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec and on an intact tertiary structure, whereas synthesis of the other modified nucleosides, including mcm5U, is less stringently connected to primary and tertiary structure (8Kim L.K. Matsufuji T. Matsufuji S. Carlson B.A. Kim S.S. Hatfield D.L. Lee B.J. RNA. 2000; 6: 1306-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The methylation step is influenced by selenium status, whereby the levels of mcm5U are enriched and mcm5Um reduced under conditions of selenium deficiency, and the ratio of the two isoforms is reversed under conditions of selenium sufficiency (2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The presence of Um34 dramatically affects Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec secondary and tertiary structure (9Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. Cruz R. Steer C.J. Hill K.E. Burk R.F.

In addition, a specialized role of the selenium-induced, Um34 tRNA[Ser]Sec in selenoprotein translation was recently reported (12Jameson R.R. Diamond A.M. RNA. 2004; 10: 1142-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the specific role of this isoform in selenoprotein synthesis has not been elucidated.The selenoprotein population in rodents is composed of 24 members, and there are 25 members in humans (13Kryukov G.V.

The function of many of these selenoproteins is not known. However, several approaches have been used in assessing their function and to provide better insights into their possible roles in health.

Exposing animals lacking a nonessential selenoprotein to stress, however, demonstrates that the animal may not cope with certain stresses compared with their wild type counterparts (27Lei X.G.

Thus, some selenoproteins that are nonessential to life of the organism probably provide protection from environmental stress.Several studies have examined the effect of altering Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec expression on selenoprotein biosynthesis, which provided another means of elucidating the function of selenoproteins and their roles in health. Removal of trsp in knock-out mice is embryonic lethal, demonstrating that selenoproteins are essential to mammalian development (29Bo ̈sl M.R. Takaku K. Oshima M. Nishimura S. Taketo M.M. Proc. Natl.

Generation of a conditional knock-out of trsp using loxP-Cre technology has shown that Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec levels can be reduced in mammary tissue by about 80%, resulting in an altered selenoprotein expression in a selenoprotein-specific manner (30Kumaraswamy E.

Mice dependent on the wild type transgene for survival manifested little or no change in selenoprotein expression, whereas mice dependent on the i6A mutant transgene rescued only some selenoproteins. Rescued selenoproteins included TR1 and TR3, whereas those that were poorly rescued included GPx1, GPx3, SelR, SelT, and SelW. Other selenoproteins, such as GPx2, GPx4, SelP, and Sep15, appeared to be partially rescued. These studies not only show that expression of some selenoproteins in mammals is highly dependent on Um34, but generating genetically altered mice that express reduced levels of a particular subclass of selenoproteins provides a unique model for examining the function of certain selenoproteins and their possible roles in health.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Animals—Selenium-75 (specific activity 1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from the Research Reactor Facility, University of Missouri (Columbia, MO); [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity ∼6000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; and [3H]serine (specific activity 29 Ci/mmol) and Hybond Nylon N+ membranes were from Amersham Biosciences.

https://openalex.org/W2082425467,"Protein transduction therapy is a newly developing method that allows proteins, peptides, and biologically active compounds to penetrate across the plasma membrane by being fused with cell-penetrating peptides such as polyarginine. Polyarginine-fused p53 protein penetrates across the plasma membrane of cancer cells and inhibits the growth of the cells. However, the protein is often entrapped inside macropinosomes in the cytoplasm. Therefore, high dose concentrations of the protein are needed for it to function effectively. To overcome this problem, in the present study, polyarginine-fused p53 was linked with the NH2-terminal domain of influenza virus hemagglutinin-2 subunit (HA2), which is a pH-dependent fusogenic peptide that induces the lysis of membranes at low pH levels. The protein was capable of efficiently translocating into the nucleus of glioma cells and induced p21WAF1 transcriptional activity more effectively than did polyarginine-fused p53 protein. Moreover, low concentrations of the protein significantly inhibited the growth of cancer cells. These results suggest that protein transduction therapy using polyarginine and HA2 may be useful as a method for cancer therapy.

Despite their broad acceptance as molecular carriers, the mechanism of internalization of CPPs and their cargo are still being discussed. Previous studies (5Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar, 6Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol.

However, recent studies (2Vives E. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Fittipaldi A. Ferrari A. Zoppe M. Arcangeli C. Pellegrini V. Beltram F. Giacca M.

J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar) have shown that the cellular internalization occurs through a temperature-dependent endocytic pathway. A very recent study (10Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) has shown that TAT-PTD fusion proteins are internalized rapidly by lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis. After internalization via the macropinocytotic pathway, the proteins are carried to macropinosomes, where most of them are then degraded (10Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). In order for the molecules delivered by CPPs to function in the cell, they generally must reach the cytosol. Therefore, protein delivery into the cytosol of target cells via macropinosomal escape is an important route of delivery. The CPP, consisting of an 11-mer polyarginine (11R), efficiently delivers peptides and proteins into cells (11Matsushita M. Tomizawa K. Moriwaki M. Li S.-H. Terada H. Ohmoto T. Matsui H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6000-6007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Matsui H. Tomizawa K. Lu Y.-F. Matsushita M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2003; 4: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The 11R-fused p53 protein (p53-11R) is delivered effectively into cancer cells and has transcriptional regulatory activity there (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, p53-11R inhibits the proliferation of the cancer cells (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). However, a high concentration (>1 μm) and repeated administration of p53-11R are needed for transcriptional activation and the growth inhibition of cancer cells (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). Entrapment of the transduced protein in macropinosomes may weaken the effect of p53-11R. For protein delivery to become a promising method for clinical cancer therapy, this problem must be overcome. Several viruses have acquired endosomal escape mechanisms that take advantage of the low pH in mature endosomes of mammalian cells (14Skehel J.J. Cross K. Steinhauer D. Wiley D.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal 20-amino acid peptide of the influenza virus hemagglutinin-2 protein (HA2) is well characterized as a pH-sensitive fusogenic peptide that destabilizes lipid membranes at low pH levels (14Skehel J.J. Cross K. Steinhauer D. Wiley D.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A recent study (10Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) has shown that TAT PTD fused with HA2 markedly enhances the release of fusion proteins from macropinosomes and that this approach has the beneficial aspect of disrupting only macropinosomes but no other types of vesicles. In the present study, we investigated whether the linking of HA2 with polyarginine-fused p53 protein induced delivery into the nucleus of glioma cells and enhanced the anticancer effect of p53-11R. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—A human malignant glioma cell line, U251-MG, was provided from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan), and a malignant glioma cell line, KR158, was a gift from Dr. T. Jacks (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). U251-MG cells contain a homozygous missense mutation corresponding to a His/Arg transition in codon 273 in p53. KR158 is a p53 gene-deficient cell line. Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were cultured in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Rat primary astrocytes were prepared from a newborn Wistar rat (Japan SLC, Inc.). The cortex of the rat on postnatal day 1 was dissected, and the meninges were removed. The cortical tissues were then treated with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C and further treated with 0.004% DNase-I (Sigma) for 10 min. The pieces of the cortex were dissociated mechanically. The dissociated cells were plated onto collagen-coated glass slides and 96-well collagen-coated dishes. The plated cell density was approximately 10,000 cells/ml. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 5% horse serum. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Construction of p53-11R and HA2-p53-9R—Human wild-type p53 cDNA was subcloned into p11R-HA and p9R-HA vectors to produce genetic in-frame 11 (11R) and 9 polyarginine (9R) fusion proteins in the COOH-terminal, as described previously (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). Influenza virus HA2 cDNA encoding 23 amino acids (GLFEAIEGFIENGWEGMIDGWYG) was tagged on the NH2 terminus of p53 cDNA in p53-9R plasmids (HA2-p53-9R). Site-directed Mutagenesis of Human p53 and HA2 cDNAs—The mutations of p53 and HA2 cDNAs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a PCR strategy as described previously (16Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.-F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.-Y. Matsushita M. Li S.-T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For dominant-negative p53, Arg at the site of 273 was changed to His as described previously (17Marutani M. Tonoki H. Tada M. Takahashi M. Kashiwazaki H. Hida Y. Hamada J. Asaka M. Moriuchi T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4765-4769PubMed Google Scholar). An HA2 mutant that has no destabilization activity of the lipid membrane at low pH was produced by replacing Gly at site 13 and Met at site 17 with Pro and Leu, respectively, as described previously (18Hsu C.H. Wu S.H. Chang D.K. Chen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22725-22733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The sequences of the mutants were confirmed with an ABI 3100 sequencer. Expression and Purification of 11R and 9R Fusion Proteins—Expression and purification of 11R and 9R fusion proteins were performed as described previously (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the constructed plasmids were transformed into BL21-DE3 Escherichia coli cells. The proteins were expressed in these cells after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The expressed proteins were purified using a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Invitrogen). After dialysis against PBS, the proteins were stored at -80 °C until they were used. Preparation of Fluorescein Isothiocyanate-conjugated p53-11R and HA2-p53-9R and the Localization of the Proteins in Living Malignant Glioma Cells—The p53-11R and HA2-p53-9R proteins were conjugated with a green fluorescent tag using a fluorescein-EX protein labeling kit (catalog no. F-10240, Molecular Probes). After purification of the proteins, U251-MG cells were incubated with each protein (0.1 μm), and the localization of the transduced proteins was observed with a confocal laser microscope (FluoView, Olympus, Japan). Western Blotting Analysis—U251-MG cells were incubated with 0.1 μm p53-11R and HA2-p53-9R. After 2 h, the cells were washed with PBS twice and placed in fresh medium in the absence of the proteins. The cells were harvested at each of the time points indicated in the text, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-p53 monoclonal antibody. Western blot analysis for p53 was carried out at high stringency, essentially as described previously (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the harvested cells were homogenized by sonication in a boiled buffer containing 1% SDS. Samples containing 100 μg of total protein were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The blots were probed with primary antibody against p53 (1:1000) (catalog no. Pab 1801, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Assay for p53-driven Transactivation—The reporter assay was performed as described previously (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the luciferase reporter vector pGL2-basic (Promega) containing a 2.4-kbp fragment of human p21WAF1 promoter was a gift from Drs. T. Akiyama (Tokyo University) and K. Yoshikawa (Osaka University). The luciferase reporter vector was transfected into 70% confluent KR158 cells in 35-mm dishes by the calcium phosphate method. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 100 nm p53-11R or HA2-p53-9R. The cells were then harvested 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 h after the protein transduction, and the luciferase activities were measured with a luminometer using a reagent kit (Tokyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan). The background luciferase activity was subtracted in all experiments. Six independent experiments were performed for each condition. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was determined using a WST-1 assay (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). After glioma cells (1 × 104/well) were seeded on 96-well flat bottom plates, they were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The cells were then supplemented with various concentrations of p53-11R or HA2-p53-9R and further incubated for 2 h (day 0). After washing with PBS, the cells were placed in fresh medium in the absence of 11R-p53 and HA2-p53-9R and further incubated for 96 h (day 4). The cell viability was measured using the WST-1 assay on day 0 and day 4 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Detection of Apoptotic Cells—Apoptotic cells were confirmed by Hoechst and TUNEL staining as described previously (19Wu H.-Y. Tomizawa K. Oda Y. Wei F.-Y. Lu Y.-F. Matsushita M. Li S.-T. Moriwaki A. Matsui H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4929-4940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, KR158 cells were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml of Hoechst 33248 (Sigma) for 1 min. The morphology of the nucleus was observed with a fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic cells were identified by the presence of highly condensed or fragmented nuclei. For TUNEL staining, KR158 cells seeded in 35-mm diameter culture dishes were incubated with p53-11R or HA2-p53-9R for 2 h. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were further incubated in fresh medium for 24 h. The cells were then fixed with 4% parafolmaldehyde, and TUNEL staining was performed with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). After TUNEL staining, the cells were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (1:1000) (Molecular Probes) for 1 h to detect F-actin. The staining was observed using a confocal laser microscope (model no. LSM510, Zeiss). Representative graphs are shown for experiments in which at least four randomly chosen fields containing 100 cells each were scored. Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using either Student's t test to compare two conditions or analysis of variance followed by planned comparisons of multiple conditions, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Time-dependent Expressional Changes of HA2-p53-9R and p53-11R in Glioma Cells—We first produced HA2-fused p53-11R protein. However, the protein was insoluble after dialysis against PBS (data not shown). Therefore, p53 protein was fused with HA2 and 9-arginine (HA2-p53-9R), which also has protein transduction activity (11Matsushita M. Tomizawa K. Moriwaki M. Li S.-H. Terada H. Ohmoto T. Matsui H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6000-6007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both HA2-p53-9R and p53-11R were delivered effectively into U251-MG cells within 4 h (Fig. 1A). After 4 h, the expression of both proteins decreased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). HA2-p53-9R expression declined more rapidly than p53-11R expression in the cells. Comparison between p53 Transcriptional Activity of HA2-p53-9R and p53-11R—To compare the transcriptional activity between HA2-p53-9R and p53-11R in glioma cells, each protein (0.1 μm) was transduced into KR158 cells, which lack endogenous p53, and the time-dependent p53 transcriptional activity was examined. The transcriptional activity in HA2-p53-9R-transduced cells was significantly higher than that in p53-11R-transduced cells at all of the times examined (Fig. 1B). The transcriptional activity of HA2-p53-9R was maximal 12 h after the protein transduction, and it then decreased gradually in a time-dependent manner. To investigate whether the enhancement of the transcriptional activity of HA2-p53-9R was the result of the function of HA2, an HA2 mutant (mtHA2) that has no endosome-releasing activity was fused with p53-9R, and the transcriptional activity of the fusion protein (mtHA2-p53-9R) was examined. The transcriptional activity of mtHA2-p53-9R was significantly lower than that of HA2-p53-9R (Fig. 1C) and was the same level as that of p53-11R. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of dominant-negative p53 protein fused with HA2 and 9R (HA2-DNp53-9R) was much lower than that of HA2-p53-9R. These results suggested that the linkage with HA2 results in increased transcriptional activity of p53 protein transducted using polyarginine (p53-11R). Time-dependent Changes of Subcellular Localization of p53-11R and HA2-p53-9R—To investigate whether HA2-p53-9R translocated effectively into the nucleus, p53-11R and HA2-p53-9R were conjugated with a green fluorescent tag, and U251-MG cells were transduced into each protein. The subcellular localization of each transduced protein was compared 30 min and 2 h after protein transduction in living cells. Moreover, to exclude the possibility that the proteins were just attached to the surface of the cell membrane, serial optical sections of 3-μm step sections along the z dimension of the cells were then collected with a confocal microscope. Both p53-11R and HA2-p53-9R were observed in the cell membrane and perinuclear region after 30 min, and there was no expression of the protein observed in the nucleus (data not shown). After 2 h, HA2-p53-9R was observed in the nucleus and cell body, whereas p53-11R remained localized in the cell membrane and perinuclear region. (Fig. 2). These results suggested that HA2-p53-9R translocates more effectively into the nucleus than p53-11R. Inhibitory Effect of HA-p53-9R on the Growth of Glioma Cells—A previous study (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that a single administration of 1 μm p53-11R fails to inhibit the growth of oral cancer cells and that repeated administration every 24 h is needed for the inhibition of their growth. The present study also showed that a single application of 1 μm p53-11R did not inhibit the growth of U251-MG cells 3 or 4 days after the protein transduction (Fig. 3A). In contrast, HA2-p53-9R inhibited the growth of the cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Lower concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 μm) of HA2-p53-9R had no effect on the growth of glioma cells 1 or 2 days after the protein transduction. However, HA2-p53-9R at the higher concentrations inhibited the cell growth 4 days after protein transduction (Fig. 3). The maximal inhibitory effect on the growth of cells was achieved with 1 μm HA2-p53-9R (Fig. 3). To confirm that the inhibitory effect of 1 μm HA2-p53-9R was not caused by a toxic effect of HA2, HA2 peptides fused with 11R (HA2–9R) were transduced into the cells. HA2–9R (1 μm) did not affect the growth of glioma cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, protein transduction of 1 μm HA2-DNp53-9R or 1 μm mtHA-p53-9R had no inhibitory effect on the cell growth (Fig. 3B). Induction of the Apoptosis of Glioma Cells by HA2-p53-9R— The effect of HA-p53-9R on the induction of the apoptosis of KR158 cells was investigated next. Treatment with 1 μm p53-11R did not induce apoptosis of the glioma cells, whereas 1 μm HA2-p53-9R markedly induced apoptosis of the cancer cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, the transduction of HA2-p53-9R did not induce the apoptosis of primary astrocytes (Fig. 5, A and B) or inhibit the growth of the cells (Fig. 5C). Moreover, p53-11R also did not affect the growth or the apoptosis of primary astrocytes, whereas pAdez-p53 at an m.o.i. of 500 significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited the cell growth of primary astrocytes (Fig. 5). Protein transduction therapy of p53 is useful for the inhibition of the proliferation of cancer cells (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zender L. Ku ̈hnel F. Ko ̈ck R. Manns M. Kubicka S. Cancer Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the usefulness is limited because of the necessity of high doses for the inhibition and because only short-term expression occurs in the cells (12Matsui H. Tomizawa K. Lu Y.-F. Matsushita M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2003; 4: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study (13Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar) showed that repeated protein transduction of p53-11R was needed for the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Although the immunogenicity of transduced proteins has not been studied in detail, repeated administration of protein therapy may initiate an immune response. Before initiating clinical trials of protein transduction therapy, the problems of protein therapy noted above must be overcome. In the present study, we showed that the linkage of HA2 peptides with p53-11R significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity and the antitumor effect of p53-11R. A single application of 0.01 μm HA2-p53-9R inhibited the growth of glioma cells, whereas a single application of 1 μm p53-11R failed to inhibit cell growth. Moreover, HA2-p53-11R did not affect the cell growth of normal glial cells. These results suggest that transduction therapy using p53 protein fused with HA2 may overcome the disadvantages of p53 protein therapy for cancer, allowing it to become a promising modality of cancer therapy. The mechanism of protein transduction of p53-11R into cells remains unknown. A recent study (10Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) showed that TAT fusion proteins were internalized rapidly by lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis, and most of the internalized proteins were entrapped in macropinosomes. The present results showed that the transduction of HA2-fused p53-11R resulted in elevated transcriptional activity of p53-11R within 6 h, whereas the transduction of the fusion product with an HA mutant with no ability to disrupt macropinosomes had no effect on the transcriptional activity. Moreover, HA2-p53-9R translocated more effectively into the nucleus compared with p53-11R. These results suggest that the majority of polyarginine fusion proteins such as p53-11R may be entrapped in macropinosomes and that the fusion of HA2 may effectively release these proteins from macropinosomes in cancer cells, although there was no measurement of macropinosome trapping/escape performed in the present study. The present results showed that normal astrocytes had low susceptibility to p53 protein transduction-mediated apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated p53 gene therapy at an m.o.i. of 500 induced apoptosis and inhibited the cell growth of the cells. Although we did not show the molecular mechanism responsible for divergent activities of HA-p53-9R between glioma cells and normal astrocytes in the present study, previous studies (21Zhang W.-W. Alemany R. Wang J. Koch P.E. Ordonez N.G. Roth J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Scardigli R. Bossi G. Blandino G. Crescenzi M. Soddu S. Sacchi A. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23D'Orazi G. Marchetti A. Crescenzi M. Coen S. Sacchi A. Soddu S. J. Gene Med. 2000; 2: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have led to a hypothesis regarding the mechanism. Previous studies have shown that the overexpression of exogenous wild-type p53 protein has suppressive activity in tumor cells, although it does not apparently induce detrimental effects in normal cells. E2F, which is a transcription factor, forms a complex with p53, and this complex stimulates the apoptotic function of p53 (24Hsieh J.-H. Yap D. O'Connor D.J. Fogal V. Fallis L. Chan F. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 78-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In normal cells, the activity of E2F is regulated tightly by the tumor suppressor Rb. Rb inhibits the activity of p53 through interaction with E2F (24Hsieh J.-H. Yap D. O'Connor D.J. Fogal V. Fallis L. Chan F. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 78-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In tumor cells, in contrast, the Rb pathway is often inactivated, resulting in the deregulation of E2F activity (25Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). The deregulated E2F could then complex with and promote p53 to induce apoptosis. This may partly explain the sensitivity of glioma cells to p53 protein transduction therapy. The present results may provide a rationale for the development of p53 protein therapy approaches to tumor treatment without the need to target tumor cells, which is one of the most critical steps in tumor protein therapy with suppressive agents. The data presented here show that HA2-p53-9R was more rapidly degraded in glioma cells compared with p53-11R (Fig. 1). It is well known that endogenous wild-type p53 protein is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the nucleus (26Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). These results suggest that HA-2-p53-9R released from macropinosomes may translocate into the nucleus, where it may be broken down rapidly by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In contrast, p53-11R may be kept longer in macropinosomes than HA-2-p53-9R protein and may not undergo rapid degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Moreover, these results suggest that p53 protein transduction therapy to transduce stable p53 protein could be further improved. One possibility is the transduction of mutated p53 protein that is resistant to ubiquitin-proteosome-mediated degradation. Simultaneous mutation of lysine residues 370, 372, 373, 381, 382, and 386 of the p53 protein to arginine residues generates a p53 molecule with potent transcriptional activity that is resistant to ubiquitin-proteosome-mediated degradation (27Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Studies to develop a transduction method for stable 11R-p53 proteins fused with HA2 are currently in progress in our laboratory. We thank A. Kemori and T. Ogawa for technical assistance, T. Akiyama and K. Yoshikawa for luciferase reporter vector and p21WAF1 promoter, and H. Matsushita and T. Jacks for KR158 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2033547042,"In this study, the mechanism of OX1 orexin receptors to regulate adenylyl cyclase activity when recombinantly expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was investigated. In intact cells, stimulation with orexin-A led to two responses, a weak (21%), high potency (EC50 ≈ 1nm) inhibition and a strong (4-fold), low potency (EC50 = ≈300 nm) stimulation. The inhibition was reversed by pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of Gi/o proteins. Orexin-B was, surprisingly, almost equally as potent as orexin-A in elevating cAMP (pEC50 = ≈500 nm). cAMP elevation was not caused by Ca2+ elevation or by Gβγ. In contrast, it relied in part on a novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoform, PKCδ, as determined using pharmacological inhibitors. Yet, PKC stimulation alone only very weakly stimulated cAMP production (1.1-fold). In the presence of Gs activity, orexins still elevated cAMP; however, the potencies were greatly increased (EC50 of orexin-A = ≈10 nm and EC50 of orexin-B = ≈100 nm), and the response was fully dependent on PKCδ. In permeabilized cells, only a PKC-independent low potency component was seen. This component was sensitive to anti-Gαs antibodies. We conclude that OX1 receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase via a low potency Gs coupling and a high potency phospholipase C → PKC coupling. The former or some exogenous Gs activation is essentially required for the PKC to significantly activate adenylyl cyclase. The results also suggest that orexin-B-activated OX1 receptors couple to Gs almost as efficiently as the orexin-A-activated receptors, in contrast to Ca2+ elevation and phospholipase C activation, for which orexin-A is 10-fold more potent. In this study, the mechanism of OX1 orexin receptors to regulate adenylyl cyclase activity when recombinantly expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was investigated. In intact cells, stimulation with orexin-A led to two responses, a weak (21%), high potency (EC50 ≈ 1nm) inhibition and a strong (4-fold), low potency (EC50 = ≈300 nm) stimulation.

The neuropeptides/hormones orexin-A and -B and the corresponding G-protein-coupled receptors OX1 and OX2 receptor were discovered in 1998 (1de Lecea L. Kilduff T.S. Peyron C. Gao X. Foye P.E.

Orexin-A (33 amino acids) and orexin-B (28 amino acids) share the property of being able to activate both orexin receptors. Orexins are signal substances both in the central nervous system and in the periphery. In the central nervous system, all of the orexinergic neurons have their origin in the lateral hypothalamus from where they project widely to regulate especially wakefulness and paradoxical sleep, appetite and food intake, and endocrine and autonomic processes. At most of the projection sites both OX1 and OX2 receptors are expressed. The orexins most often act in an excitatory manner both via putative pre-, post-, and extrasynaptic mechanisms. In the periphery, orexins and orexin receptors have been have been found in the gastrointestinal tract and in the endocrine organs. The prominent periferal effects seen so far include regulation of gastrointestinal motility and hormone production and release, especially in the adrenal gland (reviewed in Ref. 3Kukkonen J.P.

Based on measurements of binding affinity and the ability to elevate intracellular Ca2+ and liberate inositol phosphates in heterologous expression systems, the OX1 receptor shows a 10-fold preference for orexin-A over orexin-B in contrast to the OX2 receptor, which shows no preference (2Sakurai T.

However, some doubt has been cast on the validity of this practice. It is well known that different G-protein pathways can be differentially activated by different receptor agonists via agonist-selective receptor conformations (9Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 346-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and a similar process has even been suggested for orexin receptors (7Ammoun S. Holmqvist T.

Therefore, functional selectivity of receptor agonists may not be valid for all systems and responses. The cellular signals triggered upon orexin receptor activation are relatively unclear. OX2 receptors have been shown to be able to activate Gi, Gq, and Gs proteins (10Randeva H.S. Karteris E. Grammatopoulos D. Hillhouse E.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but the efficacy of the interaction and the role of these in the orexin receptor signaling is unknown. Some other studies, by the use of pertussis toxin or other techniques, suggest that Gi/o proteins are engaged in orexin signaling (8Zhu Y. Miwa Y. Yamanaka A. Yada T. Shibahara M. Abe Y. Sakurai T.

Both orexin receptor subtypes seem to share these pathways. Ca2+ elevation could well explain some of the excitatory properties of orexin. Activation of adenylyl cyclase has also been shown to be important for orexin receptor signaling, although this pathway has seldom been investigated. In rat and human adrenal cortex, orexins strongly elevate cAMP, leading to activation of protein kinase A and increased synthesis and release of glucocorticoids (26Malendowicz L.K. Tortorella C. Nussdorfer G.G. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Mazzocchi G. Malendowicz L.K. Gottardo L. Aragona F. Nussdorfer G.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), probably, at least in man, via OX1 receptors (27Mazzocchi G. Malendowicz L.K. Gottardo L. Aragona F. Nussdorfer G.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although this effect appears to be very similar to the adrenocorticotropic hormone, which utilizes the Gs pathway, the mechanisms of orexin signaling to adenylyl cyclase has not been investigated. cAMP is a ubiquitous second messenger involved in a vast array of physiological processes such as regulation of glycogen metabolism, regulation of hormone synthesis, modulation of ion channels, and regulation of gene transcription. Most of these effects are mediated through binding and activation of protein kinase A, but novel targets of cAMP, such as Epacs, guanine nucleotide exchange factors of the small G-protein Rap, have been identified recently (28de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclases (AC) are the enzymes responsible for cAMP production. Membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases with nine known mammalian isoforms are subject to many positive and negative regulatory inputs from especially G-protein-coupled receptors but also from other pathways (reviewed in Refs. 29Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar and 30Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The most important (known) inputs include G-protein α-subunits (Gαi/o, Gαs), G-protein βγ-subunits (Gβγ), Ca2+/calmodulin, and protein kinase C (PKC). Three features are characteristic: (i) each isoform responds to a different subset of these factors; (ii) for one isoform a particular factor can be inhibitory, whereas it can be stimulatory for another isoform; and (iii) the factors can show strong cooperativity or even conditionality for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Thus, for instance, Gβγ can inhibit AC1, whereas it stimulates AC2, AC4, and AC7. However, it cannot stimulate AC2 (and probably neither AC4 nor AC7) unless the AC is simultaneously stimulated by other factors (e.g. Gαs or PKC) (31Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 32Na ̈sman J. Kukkonen J.P. Holmqvist T. A ̊kerman K.E.O. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The consequence of this isoform-specific signal integration is that the cAMP response will differ from cell to cell according to the expression profile of adenylyl cyclase isoforms as well as other proteins participating in the adenylyl cyclase regulation. Recognizing the important role of cAMP in cellular processes and its putative importance of orexin receptor signaling, we wanted to investigate the intrinsic ability of OX1 orexin receptors to regulate adenylyl cyclase activity in an isolated system, where manipulations are possible. For this purpose we chose a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line recombinantly expressing OX1 receptors. This cell line has two advantages: (i) orexin receptor signaling in it has been relatively well characterized in previous studies by us and others (2Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I.

The plasmid for expression of enhanced green fluorescent proteins (GFP), pEGFP-C1, was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Robert J. Lefkowitz (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) for pRK5-βARK1-CT (C terminus of the human β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1)), Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) for pcDNAIII T8-β ARK (a fusion of the extracellular and transmembrane part of CD8 and the C terminus of the human βARK1), and Dr. Johanna Ivaska (VTT Medical Biotechnology, Centre for Biotechnology, Turku, Finland) for pEGFP-C1-PKCϵwt (fusion of GFP and PKCϵ) (37Ivaska J. Whelan R.D. Watson R. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3608-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Transfection—CHO-OX1 cells were grown on plastic culture dishes or on glass coverslips to 40–50% confluence. The dishes were washed with PBS, and the cells were transfected in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 5 h this medium was replaced with fresh Ham's F-12 medium with all of the usual supplements (see “Cell Culture”). Transfection efficiency was 40–70% as determined using expression of green fluorescent protein and function of transfected proteins (e.g. receptors, phosphodiestarases; not shown). Transfection of the cells was performed to introduce control receptors (β2-adrenoreceptor for Gs coupling and α2A-adrenoreceptor for Gβγ-dependent PLC activation (and Ca2+ release)), Gβγ sequestering peptides/proteins (βARK1 C terminus, CD8-βARK1 C terminus, Gαt), and GFP-PKC constructs. The total amount of DNA was kept the same in all of the transfections using empty plasmids. Measurement of cAMP Production in Intact Cells—The cellular ATP was prelabeled with 5 μCi/ml [3H]adenine for 2 h in culture medium, after which the cells were detached using PBS + 0.02% (w/v) EDTA, washed, and incubated at 37 °C in TBM containing 500 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, for 10 min (38Kukkonen J.P. Jansson C.C. A ̊kerman K.E.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thereafter the cells were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C, after which the reactions were interrupted by centrifugation, removal of the supernatant, addition of perchloric acid, and freezing. [3H]ATP + [3H]ADP and [3H]cAMP fractions of the cell extracts were isolated by sequential Dowex/alumina chromatography. Radioactivity was determined using scintillation counting. The conversion of [3H]ATP to [3H]cAMP was calculated as a percentage of the total eluted [3H]ATP + [3H]ADP and normalized to the recovery of [14C]cAMP tracer. The effects of inhibitors (e.g. PKC inhibitors) used in measurements were tested both under basal and stimulated conditions (e.g. TPA, orexin-A), and any slight effects on the basal level were compensated when calculating (and showing) the inhibitory potency (e.g. Figs. 5, 6, and 8).Fig. 6OX1 receptor activity stimulates adenylyl cyclase in CTx-treated cells via phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C → PKCδ.A and B, PLC activity was assessed using measurement of total inositol phosphate accumulation (A) and GFP-PKCϵ translocation (B), which is essentially dependent on diacylglycerol generation.

After this they were diluted in 4 volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm cAMP, 25 μm GTP, 100 μm ATP, 0.8 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mm phosphocreatine (pH 7.6). When the effect of anti-Gαs IgG was assessed, permeabilized cells in a minimal volume were incubated with a 1:10 dilution of the antibody for 2 h on ice before diluting in the experimental buffer. The aliquots used as controls were similarly incubated on ice; however, incubation on ice itself only slightly reduced the responses. The reactions were carried out for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence of 0.24 μm [33P]ATP (∼100 000 cpm). The reactions were interrupted by the addition of perchloric acid. Dowex/alumina separation was carried out as above except that the [14C]cAMP tracer was not included. Ca2+Measurements—Ca2+ imaging was performed to evaluate the effectivity of the different Gβγ-sequestering peptides (βARK1 C terminus, CD8-βARK1 C terminus, Gαt). A clear Gβγ-mediated response, α2A-adrenoreceptor-induced Ca2+ elevation, was selected as the test. This was verified using pertussis toxin, which fully inhibited this signal but not the endogenous P2Y-purinoceptor response. The cells were transfected with GFP, α2A-adrenoreceptor, and each Gβγ scavenger or empty vector (DNA ratio 1:2:7) as described above. 48 h later, the cells on coverslips were loaded with 4 μm fura-2 for 20 min at 37 °"
https://openalex.org/W1978557938,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope E2 glycoprotein is a key molecule regulating the interaction of HCV with cell surface proteins. E2 binds the major extracellular loop of human CD81, a tetraspanin expressed on various cell types including hepatocytes and B lymphocytes. Regardless, information on the biological functions originating from this interaction are largely unknown. Since human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) express high levels of CD81 at the cell surface, we investigated the E2/CD81 interaction in human HSC and the possible effects arising from this interaction. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2; gelatinase A), a major enzyme involved in the degradation of normal hepatic extracellular matrix, was up-regulated following the interaction between E2 and CD81. In particular, by employing zymography and Western blot, we observed that E2 binding to CD81 induces a time-dependent increase in the synthesis and activity of MMP-2. This effect was abolished by preincubating HSC with an anti-CD81 neutralizing antibody. Similar effects were detected in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts transfected with human CD81 with identical time course features. In addition, E2/CD81 interaction in human HSC induced the up-regulation of MMP-2 by increasing activator protein-2/DNA binding activity via ERK/MAPK phosphorylation. Finally, suppression of CD81 by RNA interference in human HSC abolished the described effects of E2 on these cells, indicating that CD81 is essential for the activation of the signaling pathway leading to the up-regulation of MMP-2. These results suggest that HSC may represent a potential target for HCV. The interaction of HCV envelope with CD81 on the surface of human HSC induces an increased expression of MMP-2.

Walker B.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). The HCV major envelope E2 glycoprotein exposed on the surface of virions is likely to be involved in the interactions with the host and has been identified as responsible for binding of HCV to target cells (2Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Truncated, secreted versions of E2 glycoprotein have been utilized as soluble mimics of viral particles in order to study virus-cell interactions (3Rosa D. Campagnoli S. Moretto C. Guenzi E. Cousens L. Chin M. Dong C. Weiner A.J. Lau J.Y. Choo Q.L. Chien D. Pileri P. Houghton M. Abrignani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 4Heile J.M. Fong Y.L. Rosa D. Berge R.K. Saletti G. Campagnoli S. Bensi G. Capo S. Coates S. Crawford K. Dong C. Wininger M.

In particular, E2 glycoprotein has been reported to bind to the major loop of human transmembrane molecule CD81, a member of tetraspanin protein superfamily, expressed on various cell types including hepatocytes and B lymphocytes, and, accordingly, CD81 has been proposed as a putative receptor for HCV (2Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of CD81, as well as other tetraspanin molecules, is a propensity to associate with a wide variety of membrane proteins, acting as a molecular facilitator for downstream intracellular signaling (5Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The wide range of complexes into which CD81 assembles suggests that the association of CD81 with different partners may have important and diverse effects on different cell types (6Levy S. Todd S.C. Maecker H.T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 89-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Accordingly, binding of E2 glycoprotein to CD81 may be relevant for explaining the development and the persistence of HCV infection in the liver as well as in extrahepatic tissues (7Flint M. McKeating J.A. Rev. Med. Virol. 2000; 10: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A preliminary study performed in our laboratory on sections of normal human liver indicates that CD81 is expressed at the cell surface of hepatocytes, as well as within sinusoidal structures (Fig. 1). HCV E2 binds different cell types present in liver tissue samples, although with different intensities, and this binding is prevented by preincubation of liver tissue samples with anti-CD81 antibodies (8Petracca R. Falugi F. Galli G. Norais N. Rosa D. Campagnoli S. Burgio V. Di Stasio E. Giardina B. Houghton M. Abrignani S. Grandi G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4824-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently reported that human HSC, liver-specific pericytes and key effectors of hepatic fibrogenesis, express high levels of CD81 protein at the cell surface (9Mazzocca A. Carloni V. Cappadona Sciammetta S. Cordella C. Pantaleo P. Caldini A. Gentilini P. Pinzani M. J. Hepatol. 2002; 37: 322-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An essential step in the progression of HCV-related hepatic fibrogenesis is the degradation of normal liver extracellular matrix (ECM), mediated by increased expression of proteolytic enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These enzymes are involved in the acute phases of liver injury as well as during chronic hepatic wound healing and fibrogenesis (10Arthur M.J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G245-G249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may contribute to the inflammatory and fibrogenic response to many stimuli (11Goetzl E.J. Banda M.J. Leppert D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar, 12Takahara T. Furui K. Yata Y. Jin B. Zhang L.P. Nambu S. Sato H. Seiki M. Watanab A. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), including viral proteins (13Johnston J.B. Jiang Y. van Marle G. Mayne M.B. Ni W. Holden J. McArthur J.C. Power C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7211-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The activity of MMPs, secreted mainly by connective tissue cells as proenzymes, is controlled by transcriptional regulation, zymogen activation, and specific tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) (14Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3827) Google Scholar). MMP-2 (also known as gelatinase A or collagenase IV), the most relevant MMP component involved in remodeling of normal liver ECM during hepatic fibrogenesis, efficiently degrades collagen types IV and I, fibronectin, and laminin (15Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Secretion of active MMP-2 may be stimulated by several mediators, including proinflammatory cytokines, during the inflammatory phase of wound healing. Moreover, the same mediators are able to activate the proenzymatic form of MMP-2 by inducing a membrane type matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), which subsequently activates MMP-2 (16Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Wu H. Hughes M. Garner W.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that activation of MMP-2 represents a key event in the wound healing process following acute or chronic tissue damage. Degradation of the normal ECM in areas of necrosis allows penetration of inflammatory cells exerting phagocytic and/or immunological activities. Along these lines, activation of MMP-2 can be viewed as a relevant proinflammatory event contributing to tissue injury. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of E2/CD81 in human HSC and the expression of MMP-2 following this interaction as a possible host cellular response to viral infection. Our results indicate that human HSC could represent a novel potential cellular target for HCV within the liver and show that binding of E2 to CD81 on HSC surface leads to an increased expression of MMP-2, mediated by ERK/MAPK activation followed by AP-2 transcriptional activity. Reagents—The HCV E2 protein used throughout this study was a clinical grade batch prepared by Chiron Co. (Emeryville, CA). Briefly, the protein was prepared from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably transfected with plasmid pCMVa120 (17Chapman B.S. Thayer R.M. Vincent K.A. Haigwood L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3979-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) in which the E2 sequence from amino acids 384–715 was fused to the tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence. After cell disruption and debris removal by microfiltration, the protein was purified by three subsequent chromatographic steps: lectin affinity chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography. As described elsewhere, all of the HCV envelope E2 proteins were ∼90% pure after purification (4Heile J.M. Fong Y.L. Rosa D. Berge R.K. Saletti G. Campagnoli S. Bensi G. Capo S. Coates S. Crawford K. Dong C. Wininger M. Bake R.G. Cousens L. Chien D. Ng P. Archangel P. Grandi G. Houghton M. Abrignani S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mAb 291 (IgG1) was obtained from mice immunized with Chinese hamster ovary/E2715 and screened for the ability to recognize E2 bound to target cells as described previously (4Heile J.M. Fong Y.L. Rosa D. Berge R.K. Saletti G. Campagnoli S. Bensi G. Capo S. Coates S. Crawford K. Dong C. Wininger M. Bake R.G. Cousens L. Chien D. Ng P. Archangel P. Grandi G. Houghton M. Abrignani S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The antibodies against CD81, JS81, and 1.3.3.22 were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-2 (AB809) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The Immobilon-P was purchased from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). The ECL system was from Amersham Biosciences. Gelatin-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Protein concentration in samples was determined using the bicinchoninic acid kit from Sigma. PD-98059 was purchased from Calbiochem. Human Tissues and Immunohistochemistry—These experiments were conducted on frozen surgical sections of human liver as described in detail elsewhere (18Pinzani M. Milani S. Herbst H. DeFranco R. Grappone C. Gentilini A. Caligiuri A. Pellegrini G. Ngo D.V. Romanelli R.G. Gentilini P. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 785-800PubMed Google Scholar). Dried sections were sequentially incubated with the primary anti-CD81 mAb and, after washing, with the affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse antibody. At the end of the incubation, sections were washed twice in TBS and then incubated with alkaline antialkaline phosphatase and developed. A nonimmune mouse IgG primary antibody was used as negative control. Isolation and Culture of Human HSC—Human HSC were isolated from wedge sections of normal human liver unsuitable for transplantation as previously reported (19Casini A. Pinzani M. Milani S. Grappone C. Galli G. Jezequel A.M. Schuppan D. Rotella C.M. Surrenti C. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after a combined digestion with collagenase/Pronase, HSC were separated from other liver nonparenchymal cells by ultracentrifugation over gradients of stractan (Cellsep™ isotonic solution; Larex Inc., St. Paul, MN). Extensive characterization was performed as described elsewhere (19Casini A. Pinzani M. Milani S. Grappone C. Galli G. Jezequel A.M. Schuppan D. Rotella C.M. Surrenti C. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on plastic culture dishes (Falcon; BD Biosciences) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 0.6 units/ml insulin, 2.0 mmol/liter glutamine, 0.1 mmol/liter nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, antibiotic antifungal solution (all provided by Invitrogen), and 20% fetal bovine serum (Imperial Laboratories, Andover, UK). Experiments described in this study were performed on cells between first and third serial passages (1:3 split ratio) using three independent cell lines. At these stages of culture, cells show functional and ultrastructural features of fully activated HSC. In particular, analysis of cell surface markers indicates that, at these stages of culture in vitro, HSC present with a cell marker profile identical to the so-called “interface” myofibroblasts detected in liver tissue specimens at the border between “active” fibrotic septa and the parenchyma of the liver lobule (20Cassiman D. Roskams T. J. Hepatol. 2002; 37: 527-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In all experiments, confluent HSC were left for 24 h in Iscove's SFIF medium before the addition of the different stimuli. Flow Cytometry Analysis—For flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis, cells were trypsinized, harvested, and washed with 2% fetal calf serum in Iscove's medium. E2 protein was bound to cells for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed and incubated with anti-E2 mAb for further 30 min on ice. After three washes, cells were resuspended in goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:40 dilution) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed again, resuspended in serum-free medium, and fluorescence-analyzed using a FAC-Scan flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Cells incubated with 1% BSA/PBS were used as negative controls. For CD81 analysis, cells were stained with anti-CD81 mAb (JS81) or with the isotype mouse IgG as control, washed, and incubated with an anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate, washed again, and analyzed as described previously (9Mazzocca A. Carloni V. Cappadona Sciammetta S. Cordella C. Pantaleo P. Caldini A. Gentilini P. Pinzani M. J. Hepatol. 2002; 37: 322-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were plated in Iscove's medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum on glass coverslips for 2–4 h. Once spread, cells were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2. Coverslips were blocked for 1 h with 3% heat-inactivated BSA/PBS. Cells were then incubated with E2 diluted in 3% BSA-PBS and, after three washes, stained with anti-E2 mAb, incubated, and washed again. Staining was subsequently visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse antibody (Calbiochem) before the coverslips were mounted with anti-fading Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence was examined by a series of optical sections, obtained with a confocal scanning laser microscope (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad), and images were captured, processed, and superimposed by using the LaserSharp software (Bio-Rad). An anti-CD81 mAb staining was included as a positive control. A solution of BSA/PBS 3% and a nonimmune mouse IgG were employed as a negative control for E2 and CD81, respectively. E2 Binding Assay—Binding of E2 to HSC was evaluated by a competition assay. HSC were incubated with increasing concentrations of anti-CD81 mAbs (JS81 and 1.3.3.22) or anti-HLA-I (clone W6/32; Sigma) as negative control and seeded onto 96-well E2 protein-coated plates for 1 h at 37 °C. To remove unbound cells, wells were then filled with PBS and gently washed three times. Adherent cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/PBS and then stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol, 80% H2O. Wells were then washed with water to remove excess dye, cells were then solubilized in 1% SDS, and the amount of dye was quantified by using a Bio-Rad Multiscan plate reader at 595 nm. The specificity of E2 protein binding to CD81 on human HSC was further confirmed by the displacement of E2 from the binding to CD81 in the presence of the competitive anti-human CD81 mAb (JS81). For these experiments, HSC were preincubated with increasing concentrations of E2 protein (0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 50.0, 100 μg/ml) prior to plating onto 96-well plates coated with immobilized anti-CD81 mAb (JS81) for 1 h at 37 °C. Adherent cells were then washed, fixed, stained, and solubilized in 1% SDS, and the amount of dye was quantified as described above. Gelatinolytic Zymography—Conditioned media from the cell cultures were analyzed for gelatin degradation activity by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The gel contained 5.8 mg/ml gelatin and 8% acrylamide. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C. After a brief wash with water, the SDS in the acrylamide gel was extracted by incubation with 2% Triton X-100/PBS solution. Gelatinolytic activities were developed in a buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris at 37 °C for 16 h. The gelatinolytic activities were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue R-250. The amount of 66-kDa MMP-2 was determined using scanning densitometry with NIH Image analysis software. Western Blot—Samples for Western blot were prepared differently for conditioned media and for cells. Cell monolayers were extracted with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm PMSF. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. In the conditioned media, the MMP-2 enzyme was enriched by incubation of 500 ml of conditioned medium with 30 ml of gelatin-conjugated Sepharose 4B. The Sepharose was washed with buffer containing 400 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and the bound protein was eluted with SDS-sample buffer. All samples were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P. Filters were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with individual antibodies in TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The polyclonal anti-MMP-2 was used at 1:5000 dilution. Blots were incubated for 2 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody at a 1:5000 dilution in TBS-T and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. In some experiments, cells were treated with a 1 μm concentration of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Sigma). For AP-2 blotting, a mouse mAb anti-human AP-2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect AP-2 protein. Generation of Human CD81 Stable Cell Lines—NIH3T3 cells were maintained in complete medium (90% minimal essential medium, 10% (w/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, and cells at 50–60% confluence were used in transfection assays. Transfection into cells was done by the Lipofectamine™ method with the 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) with the use of 4 μg/60-mm dish of pcDNA 3.1-CD81 or 1.5 μg/35-mm dish of pcDNA 3.1-CD81 vector. The stably transfected cell clones were generated by culturing the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (0.2 mg/ml). A stable clone expressing a high level of human CD81 (clone 42) was selected by flow cytometry analysis and used for the experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Lipid Kinase Assay—For immunoprecipitation, HSC monolayers were lysed in buffer containing 1% CHAPS, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm Na3VO4, 2 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P3O7, 2 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and immunoprecipitates were prepared using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After immunoprecipitation with anti-CD81 mAb (1.3.3.22), anti-E2 (mAb 291)-E2 protein or with nonimmune mouse IgG as a control, immune complexes were washed four times in lysis buffer and one time in 10 mm HEPES plus 5 mm MgCl2 before phosphoinositide kinase reactions were performed directly on beads. Briefly, the reaction mixture included 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 0.3% Triton X-100, 10–15 μCi of [32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.), and 200 μg/ml sonicated l-α-phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) as a substrate. Adenosine (200 μm; Sigma) was employed in these experiments as an established in vitro inhibitor of type II PI 4-kinase reactions (21Graziani A. Ling L.E. Endemann G. Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out for 5 min at room temperature and stopped with 2 m HCl. Lipids were extracted with 1:1 (v/v) chloroform-methanol, and the organic layer was resolved by TLC on potassium oxalate-treated silica gel 60 silica plates (EM Science, Darmstadt, Germany). β-Emitting radioactivity corresponding to PIP was quantified using a Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen, Waltham, MA). Lipid kinase activity is expressed as counts/min within a defined area representing the PI 4-32P. ERK Phosphorylation—Confluent cell monolayers on 100-mm dishes were growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to treatment with E2. Cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml pepstatin) and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Thirty μg of protein/sample was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked for 2 h at 25 °C with 5% nonfat milk in PBS buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20). The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an appropriate dilution of anti-phospho-ERK or anti-ERK (New England Biolabs Inc.) polyclonal antibody at 4 °C overnight, washed, and followed by incubation for 2 h with a 1:2000 dilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoblot signal was visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—For the nuclear extract preparation, HSC were grown in 100-mm dishes and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to exposure to E2 protein at different times. Cells were then washed with cold PBS, harvested by scraping, and pelleted. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4), incubated on ice for 10 min, and pelleted at 1000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (10 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm PMSF, 15% glycerol, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with constant gentle mixing. Nuclei were then pelleted at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and extracts were dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm PMSF, 15% glycerol, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay 4 μg of nuclear extract were mixed with 20 μg of poly(dI·dC) in 20 μl of a reaction buffer consisting of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl as well as 5% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min followed by the addition of 10 fmol of γ-32P-end-labeled AP-2 consensus binding sequence oligonucleotide (nucleotide sequence, 5′-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC CCG CGG CCC GT-3′; Promega, Madison, WI). Incubation was continued for 30 min. The incubation mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris-glycine buffer. The gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. Bands were quantitated by laser densitometry (model 300S; Amersham Biosciences). Competition experiments were performed with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled AP-2 consensus binding sequence oligonucleotide. CD81 Silencing by Small RNA Interference—The siRNA sequence targeting human CD81 (GenBank™ accession number NM_004356) spans nucleotides 138–156 (target was 5′-ATCTGGAGCTGGGAGACAA-3′) and is specific for human CD81 based on BLAST search (NCBI data base). Sense siRNA sequence was 5′-AUCUGGAGCUGGGAGACAAdTdT-3′, and antisense was 5′-UUGUCUCCCAGCUCCAGAUd-TdT. A siRNA sequence corresponding to nucleotides 695–715 of the firefly luciferase (U31240) was used as a negative control. The siRNAs were chemically synthesized by Qiagen-Xeragon (Germantown, MD), and, for annealing, 40 μm siRNA single strands were incubated in the annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for 1 min at 90 °C followed by 1 h at 37 °C. For transfection, the Amaxa nucleofection technology (Amaxa; Koeln, Germany) was employed. HSC were resuspended in the nucleofector T solution, available as part of the Amaxa cell optimization kit, following the Amaxa guidelines for cell line transfection. Briefly, 100 μl of 2–5 × 106 cell suspension mixed with 2 μg of pmaxGFP vector (to evaluate the transfection efficiency) plus 1 μl of 40 μm CD81-siRNA or negative control was transferred to a cuvette and nucleofected with an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus. Cells were transfected using the U-25 pulsing parameter and were immediately transferred into wells containing 37 °C prewarmed culture medium in 6-well plates. 72 h after transfection, the CD81 protein expression levels at the cell surface were analyzed on a BDLSRII cytofluorimeter, using the DIVA software (BD Biosciences). The area of positivity was determined using an isotype-matched control antibody. 104 events for each sample were acquired. Statistical Analysis—Results, relative to the number of experiments indicated, are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance and, when the F value was significant, by Duncan's test.

https://openalex.org/W1969950487,"Increased levels of Mcl-1 (myeloid cell factor-1) have been reported in several cancers, suggesting an important role played by Mcl-1 in cancer cell survival. Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein shown to delay or block apoptosis. In this work, using semiquantitative immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, and RNase protection assay, an increase in Mcl-1 expression was detected in hepatoma HepG2 cells incubated under hypoxia or in the presence of cobalt chloride. Through analysis of the Mcl-1 promoter sequence, a putative HIF-1 (hypoxiainducible factor-1) binding site was identified. A Mcl-1 promoter fragment containing this hypoxia-responsive element was able to bind HIF-1 in vitro. It also induced hypoxia-dependent transcription of a luciferase reporter gene, which was suppressed by anti-HIF-1α short interfering RNA. Finally, overexpression of Mcl-1 protected HepG2 cells against apoptosis induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide as shown by inhibition of caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. All these data suggest a potential anti-apoptotic role of HIF-1 that could protect cells against apoptosis under hypoxia by overexpression of the Mcl-1 protein.

As a result of oxygen deprivation (hypoxia), cells undergo different transcriptional adaptations that are in majority dependent on one key transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; HRE, hypoxia-response element; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Mcl-1, myeloid cell factor-1; MM, multiple myeloma; t-BHP, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RPA, RNase protection assay; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GLUT-1, glucose transporter 1; EPO, erythropoietin.1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; HRE, hypoxia-response element; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Mcl-1, myeloid cell factor-1; MM, multiple myeloma; t-BHP, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RPA, RNase protection assay; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GLUT-1, glucose transporter 1; EPO, erythropoietin. (for a review, see Ref. 1Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5207) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is composed of two subunits belonging to the bHLH-PAS family: ARNT, which is constitutively expressed in the nucleus, and HIF-1α, which is regulated by hypoxia. In normoxia (20% oxygen), HIF-1α is hydroxylated on two prolines (residues 564 and 402) by an oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase and on the asparagine 803 by one oxygen-dependent asparaginyl hydroxylase, FIH-1. Moreover, the lysine 532 is acetylated by the acetyl transferase ARD1. The two hydroxylated prolines and the acetylated lysine are recognized by the protein pVHL, which is part of a ubiquitin ligase complex, thus targeting the HIF-1α subunit for degradation by the proteasome (2Ivan M.

Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4370) Google Scholar). The hydroxylation on the asparagine prevents HIF-1α-cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300 interaction (5Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). In low oxygen conditions, HIF-1α is no longer modified and is thus stabilized. HIF-1α then translocates into the nucleus where it dimerizes with ARNT. The active HIF-1 binds to its specific site called HRE (hypoxia-response element, (5′-(G/C/T)-(A/G)-CGTG-(C/G/A)-(G/T/C)-3′), present in the promoter of target genes. The products of these target genes (glucose transporter-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and different glycolytic enzymes) allow the cell to adapt to the new conditions induced by hypoxia.Besides the role played by HIF-1 in the adaptation to hypoxia, recent data describe a possible role for HIF-1 in the modulation of apoptosis. Indeed, HIF-1 has been reported to be involved in apoptosis in embryonic stem cells (6Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R.

Moreover, different Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic members such as Nip3, Noxa, and other proteins involved in apoptosis such as RTP801 and HGTD-P have been described to be overexpressed under hypoxia (9Sowter H.M.

However, it has also been reported that hypoxia can protect cells against apoptotic cell death induced by different agents such as serum deprivation (7Blagosklonny M.V. An W.G. Romanova L.Y.

Severe hypoxia was also reported to induce the expression of a member of the IAP (apoptosis inhibitor protein) family, IAP-2 (15Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Wang J. Patel Y. Saikumar P. Semenza G.L.

Recently, Dong and Wang (17Dong Z. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9215-9221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) described the overexpression of Bcl-xL in hypoxia-selected cells resistant to cell death. In one of our previous studies, we showed that physiological and chemical hypoxia protect HepG2 cells against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)- and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (18Piret J.P. Lecocq C. Toffoli S. Ninane N. Raes M. Michiels C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, some data demonstrate that constitutive expression of HIF-1α in pancreatic tumor cells protects these cells against apoptosis induced by hypoxic and glucose deprivation (19Akakura N. Kobayashi M. Horiuchi I. Suzuki A. Wang J. Chen J. Niizeki H. Kawamura K. Hosokawa M. Asaka M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6548-6554PubMed Google Scholar). A direct evidence of the anti-apoptotic action of HIF-1 was recently reported by using siRNA against HIF-1α (20Yu E.Z. Li Y.Y. Liu X.H. Kagan E. McCarron R.M. Lab. Investig. 2004; 84: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These contradictory data indicate that HIF-1 could display either a pro-apoptotic or an anti-apoptotic role. These inverse effects are probably related to the severity of the hypoxic conditions (21Piret J.P. Mottet D. Raes M. Michiels C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).Myeloid cell factor-1 (Mcl-1) has also been shown to be overexpressed under hypoxia in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (22Leuenroth S.J. Grutkoski P.S. Ayala A. Simms H.H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 158-166PubMed Google Scholar, 23Leuenroth S.J. Grutkoski P.S. Ayala A. Simms H.H. Surgery. 2000; 128: 171-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mcl-1 belongs to the Bcl-2 family, which contains both anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins with, respectively, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL acting as anti-apoptotic factors and Bad, Bax, Bid acting as pro-apoptotic proteins. Mcl-1 was originally isolated as an early gene from ML-1 myeloid leukemia cells during phorbol ester-induced differentiation (24Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). As described for other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, Mcl-1 was shown to delay or block apoptosis induced by c-Myc overexpression, growth factor withdrawal, and cytotoxic agents (25Reynolds J.E. Yang T. Qian L. Jenkinson J.D. Zhou P. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6348-6352PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W.

Biochem. 2003; 89: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similar to the action of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 protects cells from apoptosis through blockage of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (28Wang X. Studzinski G.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The inhibition of cytochrome c release could be attributed to the ability of Mcl-1 to interact with Bax (29Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Recently, Mcl-1 was shown to complex with Bak in healthy cells and to prevent the oligomerization of Bak, blocking cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (30Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2922-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Interestingly, increased levels of Mcl-1 have been reported in several cancers, including ovarian and prostate cancers, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma (MM), and large granular lymphocyte leukemia (32Krajewska M.

An active HIF-1 binding site was identified in the promoter of the gene coding for Mcl-1. Moreover, overexpression of HA-Mcl-1 was shown to protect HepG2 cells against t-BHP-induced apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Hypoxia Incubation—Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were maintained in culture in 75-cm2 polystyrene flasks (Costar) with 15 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) liquid containing 5 ml/500 ml Pen-Strep (BioWhittaker) and 10% fetal calf serum and incubated under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Monkey kidney fibroblast cells (COS-7) were maintained in culture in 75-cm2 polystyrene flasks (Costar) with 15 ml of Dulbecco's high glucose containing 5 ml/500 ml Pen-Strep (BioWhittaker) and 10% fetal calf serum and incubated under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Hypoxia was achieved by replacing culture medium with CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) with or without 10% serum and incubating cells under 1% oxygen or in the presence of CoCl2 (150 μm).Apoptosis Induction—Apoptosis was induced using t-BHP (Merck) as described previously (18Piret J.P. Lecocq C. Toffoli S. Ninane N. Raes M. Michiels C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 24 h of serum deprivation, t-BHP was added to cells at a final concentration of 5·10-5m in CO2-independent medium during the incubation time under normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia.Extraction of RNA and cDNA Synthesis—Preparation of total RNA was performed using an RNAgent total RNA isolation system kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was made from total RNA with a Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using oligo(dT) primers.Real-time PCR—After incubation (3, 8, or 16 h) under normoxia or hypoxia, total RNA was extracted and retrotranscribed into cDNA. The mRNA expression level was quantified by real-time PCR using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aldolase and Mcl-1 mRNA expression levels were quantified using the threshold cycle method. Values were then normalized to the relative amounts of the housekeeping gene, α-tubulin. Each gene was amplified using the appropriate specific primers.Transfac 6.0 Software—To find putative HRE sites in the human Mcl-1 promoter, Transfac 6.0 analysis software was used (www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html#transfac).DNA Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry DNA analysis was used to quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells. 1.2 million HepG2 cells/T75 (Costar) were transfected on day 1 with 3 μg of plasmid pCMV-HA or pCMV-HA-Mcl-1 and the transfection agent Super-Fect (Quiagen) for 3 h. Fresh medium with serum was then added. On day 2, the medium was replaced by DMEM without serum for 24 h. On day 3, cells were incubated under normoxia or hypoxia and in the presence of t-BHP (5·10-5m) for 4 h. Thereafter, cells were washed with cold PBS before being trypsinized. Cold PBS was then added, and cells were centrifuged twice for 5 min at 1200 rpm at 4 °C. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 300 μl of cold PBS before 700 μl of cold ethanol was added drop by drop on rocking cells. Cells were incubated at -20 °C for the night for permeabilization. Cells were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1800 rpm at 10 °C. After two washes with PBS + 10% serum and centrifugation for 10 min at 1800 rpm at 10 °C, cells were resuspended in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 and RNase A (50 μg/ml) (Sigma) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, 800 μlofPBS + propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) was added to the cells before analysis for red fluorescence (relative DNA content) by flow cytometry.Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACSsan (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems). Doublets were excluded from the analysis by using the FL2 area/FL2 width gating method. 10,000 events were collected, and data were analyzed with the CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems).RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—RPA is a specific method to detect and quantitate mRNAs. This method is based on the hybridization of the target mRNA to a biotin-labeled antisense RNA probe. RNase treatment follows, resulting in degradation of single-stranded RNA and excess probe. The RNase-protected probes are purified and resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. Immobilized protected RNA probes are cross-linked to the wet membrane by exposure to UV light. Finally, the signal is quantified using Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescent substrate. The level of each mRNA species in the original RNA sample is determined based on the intensity of the appropriately sized, protected probe fragment reported to the intensity of two housekeeping genes, L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. RPA was performed on total RNA using the RiboQuant ribonuclease protection assay kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probes used in this study correspond to the hAPO-2b multiprobe template set (BD Biosciences). The control probe was Human Control RNA-2 (BD Biosciences).Mcl-1 cDNA Cloning—The Mcl-1 cDNA was obtained by PCR from the RZPD clone IRALp962P054 and cloned in-frame with the hemagglutinin tag in the pCMV-HA vector (BD Biosciences) by double restriction with BglII and EcoRI. The sequence of the primers with BglII and EcoRI linkers designed on the basis of the sequence of the human Mcl-1 cDNA (GenBank® accession number BC017197) was: 5′-GGAATTCAAATGTTTGGCCTCAAAAGAAACG-3′ sense (EcoRI linker underlined), 5′-GAAGATCTCTATCTTATTAGATATGCCAAACC-3′ antisense (BglII linker underlined). The PCR consisted of 28 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C. PCR was preceded by 5 min at 94 °C and followed by 10 min at 72 °C. After sequencing, it appears that a single mutation of the third nucleotide cytosine from the codon CGC coding for the amino acid arginine was replaced by adenosine. This mutation has no result on the sequence of the protein because the new codon is also coding for arginine.Promoter Isolation by PCR—A fragment of 155 bp of the Mcl-1 promoter containing the putative HRE site was obtained by PCR using HepG2 genomic DNA (100 ng). This fragment including the nucleotides between -983 and -828 (in comparison with the +1 transcription initiation site) was amplified by PCR using the following primer sequences 5′-TCCCCCGGGACTTGAGGCCATGAGTTCGAGACCA-3′ sense, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTCCACTTCCCACGTTCAGACGATT3′ antisense, flanked by SmaI and HindIII linkers (underlined) and designed on the basis of the sequence of the human Mcl-1 promoter (GenBank™ accession number AF147742). The PCR consisted of 28 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 72.7 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The PCR was preceded by 2 min at 94 °C and followed by 10 min at 72 °C. This fragment was subcloned in a cloning vector by restriction with HindIII-SmaI. This construction was checked and confirmed by sequencing. The insert was then amplified by PCR with new primers: 5′-GGGGTACCGGGACTTGAGGCCATGAGTT-3′ sense (KpnI linker underlined), 5′-GAAGATCTTCTCCACTTCCCACGTTCAG-3′ antisense. The PCR consisted of 34 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. The PCR was preceded by 2 min at 94 °C and followed by 10 min at 72 °C. The fragment was then cloned in the pGL3 promoter (Promega) upstream of the SV40 promoter controlling the expression of the firefly luciferase gene by restriction with KpnI to obtain the pGL3–129bp containing the wild type Mcl-1 promoter fragment (129 bp long). This construction was checked and confirmed by sequencing.Reporter Gene Assay—HepG2 transfections were performed in 24-well plates (50,000 cells/well) with SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). 460 ng of pGL3 promoter vector or the pGL3–129bp containing 129 nucleotides from the human Mcl-1 promoter were co-transfected with 230 ng of pRL-SV40 (normalization; Promega) and with 2.3 μg of empty expression vector pCMV-Myc (Promega) in DMEM without serum. 24 h posttransfection, HepG2 cells were transfected with siRNA. Finally, before hypoxia incubation (16 h), medium was replaced by DMEM without serum for 8 h. After the incubation, the luciferase activity was measured and quantitated in a luminometer using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as means of the ratio between the firefly luciferase activity and the Renilla luciferase activity.Colorimetric DNA Binding Assay for HIF-1—HIF-1 DNA binding activity was measured using a competitive colorimetric assay (Trans-AM) developed in our laboratory (38Renard P. Ernest I. Houbion A. Art M. Le Calvez H. Raes M. Remacle J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E21Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and sold by Active Motif. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For competition experiments, wild type and mutated oligonucleotides corresponding to the Mcl-1 HRE sequence were designed according to the sequence of the human Mcl-1 promoter (GenBank® accession number AF147742). The oligonucleotides W18 and M18 were designed on the basis of the EPO promoter (39Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were introduced in variable -fold excess in binding buffer, prior to nuclear extract addition. Nuclear extracts were obtained from COS-7 cells incubated for 16 h in the presence of CoCl2 in Dulbecco's high glucose medium without serum. HIF-1 binding to the HRE sequence linked to the well was revealed by anti-HIF-1α antibody (Transduction Laboratories) at a final dilution of 1/1000. A secondary horseradish peroxidase antibody against mouse IgG was used at a dilution of 1/1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The sequence of the oligonucleotides used (the HRE core is underlined and the HRE mutated nucleotides are indicated in bold) are W18, 5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′ sense, 5′-TGAGACAGCACGTAGGGC-3′ antisense; M18, 5′-GCCCTAAAAGCTGTCTCA-3′ sense, 5′-TGAGACAGCTTTTAGGGC-3′ antisense; Wmcl, 5′-TGGTGGCGCACGCCTGTA-3′ sense, 5′-TACAGGCGTGCGCCACCA-3′ antisense; Mmcl, 5′-TGGTGGCGGAATCCTGTA-3′ sense, 5′-TACAGGATTCCGCCACCA-3′ antisense; MmclA, 5′-TGGTGGCGCTTTCCTGTA-3′ sense, 5′-TACAGGAAAGCGCCACCA-3′ antisense; W25, 5′-ATGTGGTGGCGCACGCCTGTAATCC-3′ sense, 5′-GGATTACAGGCGTGCGCCACCACAT-3′ antisense; M25, 5′-ATGTGGTGGCGGAATCCTGTAATCC-3′ sense, 5′-GGATTACAGGATTCCGCCACCACAT-3′ antisense; M25A, 5′-ATGTGGTGGCGCTTTCCTGTAATCC-3′ sense, 5′-GGATTACAGGAAAGCGCCACCACAT-3′ antisense.Western Blotting—HepG2 cells were transfected for 3 h with 3 μg of pCMV-HA or pCMV-HA-Mcl-1 using the SuperFect transfection reagent; fresh medium with serum was then added to the cells for 24 h. The following day, medium was replaced by medium without serum for 24 h. Cells were then scraped in 300 μl of lysis buffer (Tris 40 mm, pH 7.5, KCl 150 mm, EDTA 1 mm, Triton X-100 1%) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, added at a 1:25 dilution; Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (NaVO3 25 mm, PNPP 250 mm, α-glycerophosphate 250 mm, and NaF 125 mm, at a 1:25 dilution). The lysate was then mixed 10 times on ice, centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with TBS-Tween 5% fat milk (Gloria) for 1 h, followed by incubation for 2 h with the primary antibody in TBS-Tween 0.1% milk. After three washes of 5 min in TBS-Tween 0.1% milk, the incubation with the secondary antibody was performed for 30 min in TBS-Tween 0.1% milk, followed by three washes of 15 min in TBS-Tween. Finally, the membrane was revealed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit anti-Mcl-1 polyclonal antibody SC-819 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:500 dilution. Monkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used at 1:100,000 dilution as the secondary antibody.The amount of proteins loaded on the gel was assayed with Bio-Rad protein assay according to the Bradford method. The revelation of the α-tubulin with a mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:100,000 dilution; Sigma) allowed determination of the total amount of proteins loaded on the gel. The secondary antibody was a sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Amersham Biosciences) used at 1:100,000 dilution.Immunofluorescence—For staining the protein Mcl-1, the following protocol was used: 50,000 HepG2 cells were seeded on glass cover slides in 24-well culture plates. The following day, the medium was replaced by medium with or without serum for 24 h prior to incubation in CO2-independent medium for 3 h in normoxia, in the presence of CoCl2 (150 μm), or in hypoxia. For co-staining hemagglutinin (HA) and active caspase-3, 50,000 HepG2 cells were seeded on glass cover slides in 24-well culture plates on day 0. On day 1, HepG2 cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid pCMV-HA or pCMV-HA-Mcl-1 and the transfection agent SuperFect for 3 h, and then fresh medium with serum was added to the cells. On day 2, medium was replaced by medium without serum for 24 h before incubation for 3 h in the presence or not of t-BHP under normoxia, in the presence of CoCl2 (150 μm), or under hypoxia.After hypoxia incubation, medium was removed and cells were fixed for 10 min with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized in PBS + 1% Triton X-100 and then washed 2 × 5 min in PBS followed by 30 min in PBS + 3% BSA (Sigma). The primary antibody was added in PBS + 3% BSA overnight at 4 °C in a wet room. The next day, cells were washed 3 × 10 min in PBS + 3% BSA before the secondary antibody was added in PBS + 3% BSA for 1 h in a wet room at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 × 10 min in PBS + 3% BSA. To visualize the nucleus, cells were then incubated for 35 min at room temperature in the presence of TO-PRO-3 (1:80 dilution in PBS + RNase 2 mg/ml; Molecular Probes). The coverslips were finally mounted in mowiol (Sigma) and observed with a confocal microscope TCS (Leica) using a constant photomultiplier. Rabbit anti-human Mcl-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:100 dilution), rat anti-hemagglutinin (Roche Applied Science) (1:100 dilution), and rabbit anti-human active caspase-3 antibody (Promega) (1:100 dilution) were used. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes), and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes) were used at 1:1000 dilution.Short Interfering RNA Transfection—The Silencer Validated siRNA anti-HIF-1α was obtained from Ambion. It targets exon 5 of the HIF-1α mRNA.For transfection with anti-HIF-1α siRNA, the transfection agent siPORT Lipid (Ambion) was used. Briefly, 2 μl of siPORT Lipid was added to Opti-MEM medium (without serum and antibiotics) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Thereafter, siRNA diluted at 100 nm in Opti-MEM medium was mixed with diluted siPORT Lipid and incubated for 20 min at room temperature before being added for 4 h onto cells previously washed with Opti-MEM medium. After 4 h of transfection, fresh DMEM with medium and antibiotics was added directly to cells.RESULTSHypoxia and CoCl2 Increase the Expression of Mcl-1 mRNA and Protein—Physiological hypoxia and chemical hypoxia (in the presence of CoCl2) protect HepG2 cells against t-BHP- and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (18Piret J.P. Lecocq C. Toffoli S. Ninane N. Raes M. Michiels C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism by which hypoxia and CoCl2 protected against apoptosis, we compared mRNA levels for different anti- or pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family in low and normal oxygen conditions. Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells incubated for 3 or 8 h under normoxia, hypo"
https://openalex.org/W1979057236,"Interdomain interactions between N-terminal and central domains serving as a “domain switch” are believed to be essential to the functional regulation of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor-1 Ca2+ channel. Mutational destabilization of the domain switch in malignant hyperthermia (MH), a genetic sensitivity to volatile anesthetics, causes functional instability of the channel. Dantrolene, a drug used to treat MH, binds to a region within this proposed domain switch. To explore its mechanism of action, the effect of dantrolene on MH-like channel activation by the synthetic domain peptide DP4 or anti-DP4 antibody was examined. A fluorescence probe, methylcoumarin acetate, was covalently attached to the domain switch using DP4 as a delivery vehicle. The magnitude of domain unzipping was determined from the accessibility of methylcoumarin acetate to a macromolecular fluorescence quencher. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant (KQ) increased with the addition of DP4 or anti-DP4 antibody. This increase was reversed by dantrolene at both 37 and 22 °C and was unaffected by calmodulin. [3H]Ryanodine binding to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, both measures of channel activation, were enhanced by DP4. These activities were inhibited by dantrolene at 37 °C, yet required the presence of calmodulin at 22 °C. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of dantrolene involves stabilization of domain-domain interactions within the domain switch, preventing domain unzipping-induced channel dysfunction. We suggest that temperature and calmodulin primarily affect the coupling between the domain switch and the downstream mechanism of regulation of Ca2+ channel opening rather than the domain switch itself.

Dantrolene (hydrated 1-(((5-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-furanyl)methylene)amino)-2,4-imidazolidinedione sodium salt) is an intracellularly acting skeletal muscle relaxant used for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia (MH). 1The abbreviations used are: MH, malignant hyperthermia; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; RyR, ryanodine receptor; MCA, methylcoumarin acetate; CaM, calmodulin; SAED, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(7-azido-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetamido)ethyl-1, 3′-dithiopropionate; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β, γ-methylene)triphosphate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′, N′-tetraacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MH, malignant hyperthermia; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; RyR, ryanodine receptor; MCA, methylcoumarin acetate; CaM, calmodulin; SAED, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(7-azido-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetamido)ethyl-1, 3′-dithiopropionate; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β, γ-methylene)triphosphate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′, N′-tetraacetic acid. MH is a potentially deadly, pharmacogenetically mediated, hypermetabolic response to volatile anesthetics that results from unregulated intramyoplasmic Ca2+ release (1Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The drug is known to inhibit excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal muscle (2Ellis K.O. Castellion A.W. Honkomp L.J. Wessels F.L. Carpenter J.E. Halliday R.P. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1973; 62: 948-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by suppressing depolarization-induced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release in normal and MH-susceptible skeletal muscle without affecting voltage sensor activation (3Szentesi P. Collet C. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Jona I. Jacquemond V. Kovacs L. Csernoch L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In MH, the voltage dependence of contractile activation is shifted to lower voltages (4Gallant E.M. Lentz L.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 28: 181-186Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas in the presence of clinical concentrations of dantrolene, i.e. 10 μm (5Flewellen E.H. Nelson T.E. Jones W.P. Arens J.F. Wagner D.I. Anesthesiology. 1983; 59: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the voltage dependence of contractile activation is shifted to higher voltages (6Hainaut K. Desmedt J.E. Nature. 1974; 252: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Morgan K.G. Bryant S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1977; 201: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar). Normalization of the voltage dependence of contractile activation may therefore be one of the important components of the therapeutic action of dantrolene. Dantrolene also confers a normal Mg2+ sensitivity to MH-susceptible muscle fibers, which would otherwise show a considerably reduced sensitivity to the normal inhibitory action of myoplasmic Mg2+ on the SR Ca2+ release mechanism (8Owen B.J. Taske N.L. Lamb G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C203-C211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lamb G.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Conferring normal Mg2+ sensitivity to mutated ryanodine receptor (RyR1) may be another key component of dantrolene therapeusis in MH.Extensive studies have been carried out to examine the effect of dantrolene on the function of isolated skeletal muscle SR. It has been shown that both dantrolene and its equipotent, water-soluble analog azumolene suppress SR Ca2+ release induced by Ca2+ and various pharmacological agents (3Szentesi P. Collet C. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Jona I. Jacquemond V. Kovacs L. Csernoch L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Van Winkle W.B.

Ito S. Ohga A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 178: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although dantrolene has been shown to suppress the ryanodine binding activity of the SR (13Fruen B.R.

J. 1997; 326: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Dantrolene (1–5 μm) has been reported to have a biphasic effect on the open probability of RyR1 channels in lipid bilayers, first activating and then blocking at nanomolar concentrations (16Nelson T.E. Lin M. Zaoata-Sudo G. Sudo R.T. Anesthesiology. 1996; 84: 1368-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but others have not been able to see any effect of this drug on single channels (3Szentesi P. Collet C. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Jona I. Jacquemond V. Kovacs L. Csernoch L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Importantly, dantrolene has been shown to at least partially restore the normal properties of RyR1 Ca2+ channels in SR isolated from MH-susceptible pigs (1Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 17Britt B.A. Scott E. Frodis W. Clements M.J. Endrenyi L. Can. Anaesth. Soc.

Thus, these studies together suggest that dantrolene interacts with the RyR to suppress the channel dysfunction that occurs with MH mutations.As widely recognized, MH mutations are not randomly distributed along the RyR1 sequence. The vast majority of them are localized to two restricted regions, the N-terminal (Cys35–Arg614) and the central (Asp2129–Arg2458) domains, whereas a third, C-terminal region (Ile3916–Gly4942) contains fewer MH mutations (19Dirksen R.T.

Chem. 2003; 49: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pathophysiological consequences of MH mutations are hyperactivation and/or hypersensitization of RyR1 Ca2+ channel activity to stimulating conditions (both pharmacological and voltage-dependent) (1Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 18Ohnishi S.T. Taylor S. Gronert G.A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 161: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, most mutations conferring susceptibility to central core disease, a rare myopathy showing a different phenotype (19Dirksen R.T. Avila G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Avila G. O'Connell K.M. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Du G.G. Khanna V.K. Guo X. MacLennan D.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), are located in the C-terminal putative channel pore region (Ile3916–Ala4942) (19Dirksen R.T. Avila G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26Du G.G. Khanna V.K. Guo X. MacLennan D.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ release properties of expressed RyR1 channels containing randomly selected MH mutations from the N-terminal and central domains have been shown to display similar properties of hyperactivation and hypersensitization (27Yang T. Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25722-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To explain these results, we have proposed a model of channel regulation that involves interdomain interactions between the N-terminal and central domains of RyR1 serving as a “domain switch” for Ca2+ channel regulation (28Yamamoto T. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11618-11625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Ikemoto N. Yamamoto T. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 671-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi S. Yamamoto T. Parness J. Ikemoto N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the resting state, the N-terminal and central domains make close contact at several as yet undetermined subdomains. The conformational constraints imparted by the “zipped” configuration of these two domains stabilize and maintain the closed state of the Ca2+ channel. Stimulation of the RyR via excitation-contraction coupling weakens these critical interdomain contacts (unzipping of the domain switch), thereby lowering the energy barrier for Ca2+ channel opening. Partial unzipping or weakening of the domain switch may also occur secondary to MH mutations in either the N-terminal or central domain. As a result of this, MH-susceptible RyR1 channels are hypersensitive to agonist stimuli.Recently, Parness and co-workers (32Palnitkar S.S. Bin B. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Williams P.G.

Chem. 1999; 42: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) localized a dantrolene-binding site within the primary structure of RyR1 using [3H]azidodantrolene, a pharmacologically active photoaffinity analog of dantrolene. [3H]Azidodantrolene specifically photolabels the N-terminal 1400-amino acid fragment of RyR1 cleaved by an endogenous, SR membrane-bound calpain (33Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jiminez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and is localized within sequence Leu590–Cys609 based on the following evidence. 1) Of several synthetic RyR1 domain peptides examined, [3H]azidodantrolene specifically photolabels only peptides containing the Leu590–Cys609 sequence (named DP1 for domain peptide-1), and 2) an anti-RyR1 monoclonal antibody recognizing DP1 inhibits [3H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of RyR1 (34Paul-Pletzer K. Yamamoto T. Bhat M.B. Ma J. Ikemoto N. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Williams P.G. Parness J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34918-34923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The dantrolene-binding site is therefore located within the domain comprising the N-terminal portion of our proposed domain switch. Since dantrolene seems to inhibit Ca2+ release, these findings have led us to suggest that dantrolene may act by reinforcing interactions between the N-terminal and central portions of the RyR1 domain switch that favor a zipped conformation. Here, we present new evidence suggesting that this is indeed at least a portion of the mechanism of action of dantrolene.In this study, we produced MH-like conditions of RyR1 (i.e. hyperactivation and hypersensitization of Ca2+ channels) in SR isolated from normal skeletal muscle by adding DP4, a synthetic domain peptide corresponding to amino acids 2442–2477 of RyR1, or anti-DP4 antibody, which, as we have recently shown, induces spectroscopic changes consistent with domain unzipping (29Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi S. Yamamoto T. Parness J. Ikemoto N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The magnitude of domain unzipping was determined from the accessibility of a fluorescence probe, methylcoumarin acetate (MCA), attached to the N-terminal domain, to a macromolecular fluorescence quencher (bovine serum albumin-conjugated QSY). The Stern-Volmer quenching constant (KQ), a measure of domain unzipping, increased with the addition of either DP4 or anti-DP4 antibody. Here, we show that the addition of dantrolene reversed the increase in KQ that was produced by DP4 or anti-DP4 antibody with an IC50 of 0.3 μm. This blocking effect of domain unzipping by dantrolene was present at both 37 and 22 °C and was independent of calmodulin (CaM). Although, at 37 °C, dantrolene alone inhibited DP4 enhancement of [3H]ryanodine binding and activation of SR Ca2+ release, both measures of Ca2+ channel activation, it required calmodulin to do so at 22 °C. These results suggest that inhibition of RyR1 domain unzipping plays a role in the therapeutic action of dantrolene. The present data also suggest that the temperature and CaM dependence of dantrolene activity on RyR1 is due to their effects on the mechanism by which the domain switch is coupled to Ca2+ channel function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of SR Vesicles—The SR microsomes were prepared from rabbit back paraspinous and hind leg skeletal muscles (Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) using the method of differential centrifugation described previously (35Ikemoto N. Kim D.H. Antoniu B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Domain Peptide and Site-specific Antibody—We used a domain peptide (DP4) corresponding to Leu2442–Cys2477 of RyR1 both as a channel-activating reagent and as a site-directed carrier to incorporate the fluorescence probe MCA into RyR1. The peptide was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Model 431A synthesizer, purified by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and evaluated by mass spectroscopy. To localize the DP4-binding site within the primary structure of RyR1, the site-specific anti-DP1 (Leu590–Cys609), anti-DP4 (Leu2442–Cys2477), and anti-DP3 (Asp324–Val351) polyclonal antibodies were used (31Kobayashi S. Yamamoto T. Parness J. Ikemoto N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Site-specific MCA Labeling at the DP4-binding Site of RyR1—Site-specific fluorescence labeling of the DP4-binding sites on RyR1 in skeletal muscle SR was performed using the cleavable heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(7-azido-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetamido)ethyl-1, 3′-dithiopropionate (SAED) (36Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Localization of the Site of MCA Attachment within the RyR—MCA-labeled RyR1 was purified from fluorescently labeled SR using heparin and hydroxylapatite affinity columns as described by Inui and Fleischer (37Inui M. Fleischer S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 490-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). MCA-labeled RyR1 was digested with trypsin (1:100, 1:10 trypsin/protein ratio) at 22 °C for 45 min, and the resultant tryptic fragments were analyzed for fluorescence after SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels. For Western blot analysis, tryptic fragments were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 90 V in 10% methanol and 10 mm CAPS (pH 11.0) at 4 °C. The blots were developed with anti-DP1, anti-DP3, and anti-DP4 primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.[3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay—Isolated skeletal muscle SR (0.5 mg/ml) that had been labeled with MCA was incubated with 10 nm [3H]ryanodine (68.4 Ci/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the desired concentration of DP4 at 22 °C for 12 h or at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Solutions contained 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm AMP-PCP, and either 10 μm dantrolene or an equivalent volume of methanol vehicle (final concentration of 0.7%) and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2). The [Ca2+] was kept at 0.1 μm using BAPTA/calcium buffer (0.449 mm CaCl2, 1 mm BAPTA, and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2)). The effect of CaM (1 μm) on radioligand binding was determined under identical assay conditions. Assays were carried out in duplicate according to established protocols (38El-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and each datum point was obtained by averaging the duplicates.Ca2+ Release Assay—Isolated skeletal muscle SR (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated at 22 or 37 °C in a solution containing 0.15 m KCl, 0.1 μm Ca2+ (BAPTA/calcium buffer), and either 10 μm dantrolene or an equivalent volume of methanol vehicle (final concentration of 0.7%), 2.0 μm fluo-3, and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) in the presence or absence of CaM. Ca2+ uptake was initiated by the addition of 1 mm MgATP to the cuvette, and the time course of Ca2+ uptake was monitored in a Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) using fluo-3 (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm) as a Ca2+ indicator (31Kobayashi S. Yamamoto T. Parness J. Ikemoto N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After Ca2+ uptake had reached a plateau, various concentrations of DP4 were added, and the resultant Ca2+ release was monitored. During the Ca2+ uptake/release reaction, the sample was continuously stirred, and the temperature was kept constant at either 22 or 37 °C.Spectroscopic Monitoring of Domain Unzipping—To make a macromolecular collisional quencher, QSY™ 7 carboxylic acid (2.5 mm) was conjugated with 0.5 mm bovine serum albumin by incubation in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) at 22 °C for 60 min in the dark. Unreacted QSY™ 7 carboxylic acid was removed by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. Fluorescence quenching by the conjugate was performed by measuring the steady-state fluorescence of SR labeled with MCA (excitation at 348 nm and emission at 445 nm; Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer). Fluorescently labeled SR (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated at either 22 or 37 °C in a solution containing 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm AMP-PCP, 0.1 μm Ca2+ (BAPTA/calcium buffer), and either various concentrations of dantrolene or an equivalent volume of methanol vehicle (final concentration of 0.7%) and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2). Various concentrations of DP4 or 20 μg/ml anti-DP4 antibody was used to induce domain unzipping, and DP4-mut, in which one mutation was made to mimic R2458C MH mutation, was used as a negative control. The effect of dantrolene on domain unzipping was investigated by determining the effect of this drug on RyR1 MCA fluorescence in the presence or absence of 1 μm CaM. The data were analyzed using the Stern-Volmer equation: F0/F = 1 + K[Q], where F and F0 are fluorescence intensities in the presence and absence of added quencher, respectively; K is the quenching constant, a measure of the accessibility of the protein-bound probe to the quencher; and [Q] is the concentration of the quencher (QSY) (29Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi S. Yamamoto T. Parness J. Ikemoto N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).RESULTSDantrolene Inhibits an Abnormal Unzipping of the Domain Switch—To investigate the effect of dantrolene on the mode of interdomain interaction, we utilized the MCA fluorescence quenching technique we developed to determine the extent of unzipping of the RyR1 domain switch (see “Experimental Procedures”) (29Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi S. Yamamoto T. Parness J. Ikemoto N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown previously (29Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), DP4 mediates the specific MCA labeling of the N-terminal 1400-amino acid segment of RyR1. The precise location of DP4-mediated MCA labeling of RyR1 within the N-terminal 1400-amino acid region has not been determined, and we do not yet know whether it occurs in the N-terminal MH domain (Cys35–Arg614). To better define where MCA is incorporated, we used DP4 conjugated with the heterobifunctional cross-linker SAED, as a site-directing carrier, as described previously (29Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The SAED-DP4 conjugate was photo-cross-linked to its binding site, and the DP4 moiety was removed under reducing conditions. MCA-labeled RyR1 was purified and subjected to tryptic digestion. The process of degradation of the fluorescently labeled polypeptide chain was then followed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1, partial digestion of fluorescently labeled RyR1 with a low concentration of trypsin (100:1 (w/w) RyR protein/trypsin ratio) resulted in the appearance of two major fluorescently labeled fragments with approximate molecular masses of 155 and 140 kDa. Digestion with a higher concentration of trypsin (10:1 RyR protein/trypsin ratio) resulted in the appearance of several fluorescently labeled fragments. As shown in the Western blot of Fig. 1, the 155- and 140-kDa MCA-labeled bands stained with both anti-DP1 (Leu590–Cys609) and anti-DP3 (Asp324–Val351) antibodies, whereas the 51-kDa MCA-labeled band stained with anti-DP3 antibody, but not with anti-DP1 antibody. Given the established trypsin cleavage sites of RyR1 (Fig. 1, scheme, arrows) (39Chen S.R. Airey J.A. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22642-22649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the MCA-labeled RyR1 polypeptide chain degrades in the following order: 550 kDa > N-terminal 155 kDa > N-terminal 140 kDa > N-terminal 51 kDa, as illustrated in the scheme shown in Fig. 1. Since the 51-kDa MCA-labeled region is included in the N-terminal MH domain encompassed by Cys35–Arg614, these results indicate that DP4-mediated MCA labeling has taken place within the presumed N-terminal domain portion of the domain switch. These results also suggest that DP4, hence Leu2442–Pro2477 of the central domain of RyR1, binds to the N-terminal domain, as predicted from our domain switch hypothesis.The domain switch hypothesis predicts that, if the MCA probe attached to the N-terminal domain is buried in the zipped configuration, it will be relatively inaccessible to a macromolecular fluorescence quencher, bovine serum albumin-conjugated QSY. Unzipping should, however, render the MCA probe more accessible to the quencher. DP4 has been previously shown to enhance [3H]ryanodine binding (28Yamamoto T. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11618-11625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), to induce Ca2+ release from the SR (29Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), to induce contraction in skinned muscle fiber at an inhibitory Mg2+ concentration (41Lamb G.D. Posterino G.S. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C207-C214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to increase the frequency of Ca2+ sparks in saponin-permeabilized fibers (42Shtifman A. Ward C.W. Yamamoto T. Wang J. Olbinski B. Valdivia H.H. Ikemoto N. Schneider M.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 116: 15-31Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and to increase the open probability of single channels (42Shtifman A. Ward C.W. Yamamoto T. Wang J. Olbinski B. Valdivia H.H. Ikemoto N. Schneider M.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 116: 15-31Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, DP4 mimics MH-like hyperactivation and hypersensitization of the RyR1 Ca2+ channel in the otherwise wild-type system. Furthermore, a mutation in DP4 (DP4-mut) that mimics the R2458C MH mutation results in virtually complete loss of the activities of wild-type DP4 (28Yamamoto T. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11618-11625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 41Lamb G.D. Posterino G.S. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. Am. J.

Physiol. 2002; 116: 15-31Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the idea that MH mutations weaken domain-domain interactions within RyR1 that are mimicked by synthetic domain peptide-domain (RyR) interaction. Thus, we used DP4 herein to mimic MH-like channel dysfunction and to investigate the effects of dantrolene on these functions.We first determined the fluorescence intensity of bound MCA as a function of increasing concentrations of the quencher in the absence or presence of DP4 at 22 °C. Fig. 2A shows the Stern-Volmer plot of fluorescence quenching of MCA attached to the N-terminal domain in the presence of various concentrations of DP4. The slope of the plot, which is equal to the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (KQ), is a measure of the degree of domain unzipping. As shown in Fig. 2B, the KQ′/KQ value (where KQ′ is the quenching constant in the presence of DP4 or DP4-mut, and KQ is the quenching constant in their absence) was used to assess the extent of domain unzipping. KQ′/KQ increased with increasing concentrations of DP4 and leveled off at ∼100 μm peptide. Significantly, the DP4 concentration dependence of the increase in KQ′/KQ correlates well with the DP4 concentration dependence of activation of RyR Ca2+ channels (cf.Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2151631634,"We demonstrated previously that Calu-3 airway epithelial cells sense adenosine on their luminal surface through adenosine A2B receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase. Occupancy of these receptors leads to activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel through protein kinase A (PKA) anchored at the apical membrane. Because luminal A2B receptor activation does not raise total cellular cAMP levels, we hypothesized that activation of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) confines cAMP generated by apical A2B receptors to a microdomain that includes the CFTR channel. Using reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and activity measurements, PDE4D was identified as the major PDE species in airway epithelia. Consistent with these results, inhibitors of PDE4, but not PDE3, selectively abolished the lateral confinement of cAMP signaling in apical membrane patches during cell-attached recordings. Furthermore, stimulation of the CFTR in excised apical patches by rolipram and RS25344 indicated that PDE4 is localized in close proximity to the CFTR channel. Indeed, immunohistochemistry of human airway sections revealed that PDE4D is localized in the apical domain of the cell. PDE4 was activated after luminal adenosine exposure in a PKA-dependent manner. Because PDE4 activity is positively regulated by PKA, our results support a model whereby the PDE diffusion barrier is proportional to the degree of receptor stimulation. These findings underscore the concept that subcellular localization of individual PDE isozymes is an important mechanism for confining cAMP signaling to functional domains within cells.

Numerous cellular processes are initiated, modulated, or terminated by cAMP (1Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Acting on receptors and transducers, diverse extracellular stimuli elicit cAMP production by membrane-bound adenyl cyclases, but the spatial and temporal organization required to tailor cAMP signaling to individual cellular responses is not completely understood. In the case of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; PDE, phosphodiesterase; ADO, adenosine; AMPK, AMP-dependent protein kinase; AMPCP, adenosine 5′-[α,β-methylene]diphosphate; WD-HBE, well-differentiated human bronchial epithelium; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; AKAP, A kinase-anchoring protein.1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; PDE, phosphodiesterase; ADO, adenosine; AMPK, AMP-dependent protein kinase; AMPCP, adenosine 5′-[α,β-methylene]diphosphate; WD-HBE, well-differentiated human bronchial epithelium; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; AKAP, A kinase-anchoring protein. we reported previously that luminal adenosine elevated juxtamembrane cAMP levels and stimulated the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) to increase CFTR open probability (2Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 3Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 79-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that this signaling is dependent on the close proximity of each of these signaling components because cAMP-dependent stimulation of the CFTR initiated by adenosine A2B receptors requires locally anchored PKA (4Huang P. Trotter K. Boucher R.C. Milgram S.L. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C417-C422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, our patch clamp experiments also indicated that apical A2B receptors excluded from cell-attached patches did not modulate the CFTR within cell-attached patches (2Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This result suggests that diffusion of cAMP near the apical cell membrane is constrained in a manner similar to that observed in other model systems (5Zaccolo M. Pozzan T.

Signaling proteins are frequently organized into multi-protein complexes responsible for signal amplification or pathway specification as in the case of G protein-coupled receptors and calcium channels (8Davare M.A. Avdonin V.

In epithelial cells, a complex composed of B2 adrenergic receptors, adenyl cyclase, PKA, and CFTR may be formed via interaction with A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) and the ezrin/moesin/radixin-binding protein, EBP50 (10Naren A.P.

This complex promotes rapid cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and activation of the channel. In many instances, PKA also is associated with proteins involved in inactivation of effector proteins. For example, protein phosphatases can also directly bind AKAPs to promote rapid and specific dephosphorylation of specific substrates (11Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs), the enzymes that degrade and inactivate cAMP, have been found recently in complex with AKAPs and PKA (12Tasken K.A. Collas P. Kemmner W.A. Witczak O. Conti M. Tasken K. J.

This localization of PDEs in close proximity to PKA is thought to control the access of cAMP to binding sites on the regulatory subunit of the kinase (14Conti M. Richter W. Mehats C. Livera G.

To define the role of PDE4 in signal compartmentalization in polarized cells, we extended our previous observations with regard to local cAMP signaling in human airway epithelium and assessed the impact of PDEs in limiting apical cAMP signaling and the regulation of CFTR. We find that PDE4D is a critical component of cAMP signaling at the apical membrane that controls the diffusion of cAMP from its site of generation and that this control is modulated through PKA activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Chemicals—All chemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Calbiochem unless otherwise noted. RS25344 was a generous gift of Roche Applied Science.Cells—Human Calu-3 cells were seeded as described previously (2Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) on Costar clear transwells or homemade permeable supports (12-mm diameter for cAMP assays and 1.5-mm diameter for patch clamp studies), grown until confluent, and polarized with a resistance greater than 100 ohm·cm2.Single-channel Studies—The procedures were essentially as described previously (2Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, CFTR Cl- channel activity was recorded at a membrane potential of 60 mV. For cell-attached recording, both the pipette and the bath contained 160 mm Tris·Cl and 30 mm sucrose, pH 7.0. The resistance of an open pipette was 6–8 megaohms. Tests of adenosine (ADO) or forskolin outside the pipette were made by cumulative additions to the bath as indicated. For outside-out recording, both the pipette and the bath solutions were the same as described previously (2Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Adenosine 5′-[α,β-methylene]diphosphate (AMPCP) was present at 0.3 mm in pipette and bath solutions in both recording configurations.Ussing Chamber Studies—CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion was measured as described previously (27Stutts M.J. Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C425-C433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on collagen membrane supports were mounted in conventional Ussing chamber devices. The submucosal bathing solution was Krebs bicarbonate Ringer's solution, and the mucosal solution was low-Cl- (3 mm) Krebs bicarbonate Ringer's solution with gluconate. Bioelectric properties were digitally recorded from the output of voltage clamps (no. VCC600; Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA) using ACQUIRE software (Physiologic Instruments). Voltage was clamped to 0 mV except for 3-s pulses to ±10 mV every 60 s. Tissue conductance was calculated from the resulting current deflections. For each experiment, basal properties were recorded for 20–40 min. Test compounds (ADO, cilostamide, RS25344, and so forth) were added to the low-Cl- luminal bath. Maximum cAMP-dependent Isc (short circuit current) was recorded after bilateral exposure to 10 μm forskolin. Relative potency was determined by fitting curves to the fractional changes induced by sequentially increasing concentrations of test substances relative to the response to forskolin. These conditions resulted in a basal CFTR-mediated Isc of 30–40 μA/cm2 and a maximally stimulated CFTR current of ≈150–200 μA/cm2.PDE Assay—Polarized Calu-3 cells were lysed in SB1 buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 m NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 μm microcystin, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). The cell lysates were spun at 14,000 × g, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated using 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose bound to 5 μl of the following PDE4 antibodies: rabbit anti-4D3, rabbit anti-4D5, pan-4A (AC55), pan-4B (K118), or pan-4D (M3S1). PDE activity was measured as described previously (28Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were assayed in a reaction mixture of 200 μl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm cAMP, 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 μCi of [3H]cAMP for 10 min at 33 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition 200 μl of 10 mm EDTA in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by heat inactivation in a boiling water bath for 1 min. The PDE reaction product 5′-AMP was then hydrolyzed by incubation of the assay mixture with 50 μg of Crotalus atrox snake venom for 20 min at 33 °C. The resulting adenosine was separated by anion exchange chromatography using 1 ml of AG1-X8 resin and quantitated by scintillation counting.Immunostaining—Human trachea sections were provided by the University of North Carolina Cystic Fibrosis Center Histology Core Facility, and immunostaining was performed as described previously (29Kreda S.M. Gynn M.C. Fenstermacher D.A. Boucher R.C. Gabriel S.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, frozen tissue sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature (4 min), permeabilized in 100% ethanol at 20 °C (4 min), and blocked in 20% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h. Sections were then incubated in primary antiserum (pan-4D (M3S1) or rabbit anti-4D5) or pooled normal rabbit IgGs diluted in phosphate-buffered saline for 16 h at 4 °C. This was followed by phosphate-buffered saline washes and incubation with Alex594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Tissues were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Paraffin-embedded sections also were processed as described previously (30Kultgen P.L. Byrd S.K. Ostrowski L.E. Milgram S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4156-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Photomicrographs were taken using a Leica TCS 4D confocal microscope at powers indicated in the figure legends. All images were captured and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop.Western Blotting—PDE proteins were immunoprecipitated using PDE4 isoform-specific or pan-PDE4 antisera. Precipitated proteins were washed extensively and analyzed by Western blot using the pan-PDE4D monoclonal antibody (generously provided by ICOS, 1:5000), rabbit anti-4D3 antibody, or anti-4D5 polyclonal antibody as described previously (31Iona S. Cuomo M. Bushnik T. Naro F. Sette C. Hess M. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) after RNAlater treatment (Ambion, Austin, TX). Genomic DNA contamination was removed by DNase treatment. Sample RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry, and 200 ng was reverse-transcribed to cDNA in a total reaction volume of 22 μl. Briefly, a mixture of 200 ng of total RNA, 200 ng of random primers (Invitrogen), and 10 mmol of deoxynucleotide triphosphate in a total volume of 12 μl was denatured at 65 °C for 5 min and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature and 2 min at 42 °C with 4 μl of 5× First-Strand Buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (Invitrogen), and 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega). Two hundred units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Promega) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 50 min at 42 °C. Finally, the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 70 °C to inactivate the enzyme. Primers and conditions used to amplify each of the phosphodiesterase isoforms can be supplied upon request.cAMP Assay—Before ADO stimulation, Calu-3 cells were incubated for 1 h in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing AMPCP and either cilostiamine, RS25344, or neither. Cells were then stimulated for 5 min with 10 μm ADO at 37 °C. This was followed by cell lysis and cAMP enzyme immunoassay (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn preliminary patch clamp experiments, we used a pharmacological approach to determine which PDE gene families modulated adenosine-mediated activation of CFTR channel activity in cell-attached patches. We found that only inhibitors of PDE3 and PDE4 affected CFTR currents, with PDE4 inhibitors being the most efficacious (data not shown). On the basis of this preliminary finding, we further characterized the expression of these two groups of PDEs in the Calu-3 cell line, a model system for exploring CFTR function in airway epithelia.We monitored PDE enzyme activity in the presence of different inhibitors, and we found that PDE3 and PDE4 families of enzymes account for ∼60% of the total activity (Fig. 1A). Because four distinct genes compose the PDE4 family, we further analyzed the pattern of PDE4 expression in Calu-3 cells using immunoprecipitation with isoform-specific antibodies. PDE4D accounted for the majority (60%) of PDE4 activity in Calu-3 cells and, by inference, up to ∼15% of total cAMP PDE activity (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with previous reports of PDE expression in well-differentiated human bronchial epithelium (WD-HBE) (20Wright L.C. Seybold J. Robichaud A. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L694-L700PubMed Google Scholar, 21Fuhrmann M. Jahn H.U. Seybold J. Neurohr C. Barnes P.J. Hippenstiel S. Kraemer H.J. Suttorp N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and with in situ hybridization studies in mice (32Mehats C. Jin S.L. Wahlstrom J. Law E. Umetsu D.T. Conti M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, more than half of the total PDE activity in WD-HBE was due to PDE4, and ∼50% of PDE4 activity in these cells was immunoprecipitated with PDE4D-selective antibodies. 2A. P. Barnes, G. Livera, M. Conti, and S. L. Milgram, unpublished observations.The presence of multiple PDE isoforms was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR analysis of PDE3 and PDE4 mRNA expression in both Calu-3 cells and WD-HBE (Table I). Amplicons corresponding to PDE3A, PDE3B, and the PDE4 families were readily detected, consistent with our previous observations using PDE activity with the exception of PDE4C; however, this may reflect a transcription/translation disparity. Of the nine known PDE4D gene-derived variants, transcripts corresponding to PDE4D3, PDE4D5, PDE4D7, and PDE4D9 were amplified from Calu-3 cell mRNA. Western blot analysis of immuno-enriched PDE4D from Calu-3 and WD-HBE cells indicated that the most abundant gene products migrated on SDS-PAGE as PDE4D5 and PDE4D7 (Fig. 1C). Western blots using a PDE4D5-specific antiserum confirmed that this immunoreactivity is indeed due to PDE4D5 (data not shown).Table ISummary of reverse transcription-PCR of PDE3 and PDE4 expression profile in Calu-3 and WD-HBE cellsCalU-3WD-HBEPDE3A++PDE3B++PDE4A++PDE4B--PDE4C+-PDE4D++4D1/2++4D3++4D4--4D5++4D6--4D7++4D8-+4D9-+ Open table in a new tab We next tested whether inhibitors of PDE3 and PDE4 affect CFTR Cl- current in cultured Calu-3 monolayers after luminal application of ADO. RS25344 (33Alvarez R. Sette C. Yang D. Eglen R.M. Wilhelm R. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 616-622PubMed Google Scholar), an inhibitor of PDE4 isozymes, modestly shifted the dose-response curve for ADO stimulation of the CFTR to the left, whereas cilostamide, a selective PDE3 inhibitor, had no effect (Fig. 2A). We next asked whether PDE3 or PDE4 inhibitors affected total cellular cAMP while simultaneously increasing CFTR responses to A2B stimulation (Fig. 2B). In agreement with our previous observation (2Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), luminal ADO alone did not increase total cAMP levels in these cells. Interestingly, ADO in combination with PDE inhibitors also generated no detectable changes in total cAMP levels, even when we used concentrations of ADO and PDE inhibitors that maximally stimulated CFTR currents in patch clamp experiments (described below). These data suggest that A2B receptors stimulate cAMP production in a local compartment shared with AKAP-anchored PKA (4Huang P. Trotter K. Boucher R.C. Milgram S.L. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C417-C422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the PKA in turn phosphorylates and activates CFTR. To further characterize the role of PDEs in local regulation of the CFTR, we next tested the effect of PDE inhibitors on the ability of apical A2B receptors to signal laterally to the CFTR contained within cell-attached patches. In this paradigm, ADO added to the luminal bath under control conditions did not effect the activation of the CFTR within the patch (Fig. 2C), consistent with our previous results (2Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, when Calu-3 cells were pretreated with 300 nm RS25344 (highly specific for PDE4 inhibition at this concentration), ADO applied to the bath readily stimulated the CFTR within the cell-attached patch. Indeed, when cultures were pretreated with RS25344, ADO stimulated CFTR almost as effectively as 10 μm forskolin (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the dramatic effect of RS25344, pretreatment with cilostamide, a selective inhibitor of PDE3 isozymes, had no significant effect on CFTR currents (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, similar results were observed when comparing rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) and milrinone (PDE3 inhibitor; data not shown), suggesting that PDE4 isozymes are critically involved in modulating the spread of cAMP signaling at the apical surface in Calu-3 cells. It is also important to note that the effect of RS25344 on ADO stimulation of CFTR in cell-attached patches appeared more dramatic than the modest shift induced in the adenosine CFTR Isc dose-response relation. The Calu-3 Isc is a composite of multiple electrochemical driving forces and does not directly measure apical conductance as described previously (34Singh A.K. Singh S. Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. van Driessche W. Bridges R.J. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 70: 129-142PubMed Google Scholar). Plausibly, stimulation of apical anion conductance due to PDE inhibition would not dominate Isc under these conditions.Fig. 2Selective PDE4 inhibitor alters compartmentalized regulation of CFTR. A, effect of PDE inhibitors on regulation of CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion by ADO. RS25344 (0.3 μm; •), cilostamide (1.0 μm; ▴), or vehicle (H2O or Me2SO; ▪) was added to the luminal bath. Isc responses (Cl- secretion) to increasing concentrations of ADO were recorded and plotted as a percentage of the maximum forskolin-stimulated Isc. B, cAMP accumulation stimulated by 10 μm ADO in the presence or absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (1.0 μm cilostamide or 0.3 μm RS25344) and the effect of 2 μm forskolin.

Pipette voltage was clamped at +30 mV throughout. CFTR channels open as upward deflections. Cultured epithelia were pretreated with Me2SO/H2O (vehicle), 0.3 μm RS25344, or 1.0 μm cilostamide (data not shown). Activity was recorded for 240 s (basal period). ADO (10 μm) was introduced into the luminal bath, and channel activity was recorded for 300 s. Subsequently, forskolin (10 μm) was added to the luminal mixture to maximally stimulate CFTR. Inset shows a 10-s segment of activity at higher resolution. D, summary data from the experiments illustrated in C. For each experimental condition, the CFTR NPo (channel number × open probability) in the basal and ADO periods was calculated and normalized to the value observed during exposure to both ADO and forskolin. Error bars, S.E. *, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although these inhibitor studies strongly suggest that PDE4 isozymes limit the spread of subapical cAMP, we cannot rule out the possibility that the cell-permeant inhibitors we used acted indirectly through effectors located outside the subapical domain of the cell. Therefore, we generated excised apical membrane patches in the outside-out configuration from the Calu-3 cells and exposed them to PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors. In this paradigm, traces indicate endogenous channel activity because the patches were not stimulated with ADO. Channel opening increased with increasing concentrations of the PDE4 inhibitor (Fig. 3A). To confirm that this observation results from cAMP signaling through PKA and not through nonspecific effects due to generation of the patch, we included PKI, a PKA-specific inhibitor, in the pipette solution (Fig. 3B). To test whether PDE3 isozymes were also associated with excised apical membrane patches, we added the PDE3 inhibitor milrinone to the bath, but we saw no significant effect on channel kinetics (Fig. 3, C and D). These data indicate that the membrane and submembranous complexes associated with the patch contain the components necessary for regulating CFTR signaling and that this regulation involves factors sensitive to inhibitors of PDE4. It is also important to note that in both cell-attached and outside-out patches, both RS25344 and forskolin are able to permeate the membrane, excluding the possibility that the effects observed represent a physical barrier created by the membrane geometry near the pipette tip.Fig. 3CFTR is regulated by apical PDE4 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2047751135,"Removal of pyrophosphate from dihydroneopterin triphosphate (DHNTP) is the second step in the pterin branch of the folate synthesis pathway. There has been controversy over whether this reaction requires a specific pyrophosphohydrolase or is a metal ion-dependent chemical process. The genome of Lactococcus lactis has a multicistronic folate synthesis operon that includes an open reading frame (ylgG) specifying a putative Nudix hydrolase. Because many Nudix enzymes are pyrophosphohydrolases, YlgG was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. The recombinant protein showed high DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity with a Km value of 2 μm, had no detectable activity against deoxynucleoside triphosphates or other typical Nudix hydrolase substrates, required a physiological level (∼1 mm) of Mg2+, and was active as a monomer. Essentially no reaction occurred without enzyme at 1 mm Mg2+. Inactivation of ylgG in L. lactis resulted in DHNTP accumulation and folate depletion, confirming that YlgG functions in folate biosynthesis. We therefore propose that ylgG be redesignated as folQ. The closest Arabidopsis homolog of YlgG (encoded by Nudix gene At1g68760) was expressed in E. coli and shown to have Mg2+-dependent DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity. This protein (AtNUDT1) was reported previously to have NADH pyrophosphatase activity in the presence of 5 mm Mn2+ (Dobrzanska, M., Szurmak, B., Wyslouch-Cieszynska, A., and Kraszewska, E. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 50482–50486). However, we found that this activity is negligible at physiological levels of Mn2+ and that, with 1 mm Mg2+, AtNUDT1 prefers DHNTP and (deoxy) nucleoside triphosphates.

The enzyme was accordingly named DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase. The Km for DHNTP was 11 μm, and activity was Mg2+-dependent. No evidence was presented showing this activity to be necessary for folate synthesis, however. More recent work in Bacillus subtilis has questioned the requirement for an enzyme, because chemical conversion of DHNTP to DHNP was observed at pH 8 and 37 °C in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ (10De Saizieu A. Vankan P. van Loon A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations studied were unphysiologically high (5–12 mm), with typical cytosolic levels of free Mg2+ and Ca2+ being ∼1 mm and ∼0.1 μm, respectively, in both bacteria and plants (11Chang C.F.

If it is not, engineering the overexpression of a DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase could be used to correct the problem. The annotated genome sequence of the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis (18Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) offers a clue to the existence of a specific DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase, for it reveals a folate biosynthesis gene cluster in which known folate genes flank a gene (ylgG) encoding an unknown protein from the Nudix hydrolase family. Nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked to x) hydrolases are typically small proteins (15–25 kDa), contain a characteristic motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U is a hydrophobic residue), and many have nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity (19Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ylgG was shown to be cotranscribed with three of the flanking folate genes in a multicistronic operon (15Sybesma W. Starrenburg M. Kleerebezem M. Mierau I. de Vos W.M. Hugenholtz J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3069-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Sybesma W. Hugenholtz J. Mierau I. Kleerebezem M. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Genomic evidence thus identifies YlgG as a candidate for the elusive DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase. In this study, we set out to find whether recombinant L. lactis YlgG has specific DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity, and whether ylgG deletants are defective in pteridine and folate synthesis. When this proved to be the case, we sought homologs of YlgG among the Nudix proteins of Arabidopsis (21Dobrzanska M. Szurmak B. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Kraszewska E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50482-50486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and we showed that the closest homolog has DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity. Chemicals and Reagents—Pteridines were obtained from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). The Biomol Green™ phosphate assay reagent was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid superflow resin was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). PD-10 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were from MWG Biotech (High Point, NC). Reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMNH) was a gift of G. Magni (University of Ancona, Italy). Other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher. Inactivation of ylgG by Double Crossover Recombination—The bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed in Table I. E. coli was grown at 37 °C in TY medium (22Rottlander E. Trautner T.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1970; 108: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and L. lactis was grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (23Terzaghi B.E. Sandine W.E. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.5% glucose (GM17 medium) or in chemically defined medium (CDM), prepared as described (24Otto R. ten Brink B. Veldkamp H. Konings W.N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1983; 16: 69-74Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) except that folic acid was omitted. E. coli was transformed by heat shock and L. lactis by electroporation (25de Vos W.M. Vos P. de Haard H. Boerrigter I. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For E. coli, kanamycin and erythromycin were used at final concentrations of 50 and 200 μg/ml, respectively. PCRs were performed with Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). The pre-integration vector for inactivation of ylgG was constructed by using pORI280 (26Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and an amplified linear DNA fragment (2287 nucleotides) consisting of 450 bp of the 3′-end of folP, the entire ylgG gene, and the entire folC gene, by using primers folPNcoI-F and folCXbaI-R, which contained an NcoI site and an XbaI site, respectively (Table II). The amplicon was digested with NcoI and XbaI and cloned between the matching sites in pORI280, giving plasmid pORI280-folP-ylgG-folC. This plasmid was transformed to E. coli and harvested. The final integration vector, containing an in-frame deletion of almost the entire ylgG gene, was obtained by PCR amplification using pORI280-folP-ylgG-folC as a template and primers ylgGPstI-F and ylgGPstI-R (Table II). Both primers contained a terminal PstI site. The amplicon was digested with PstI and ligated, generating plasmid pORI280-folP-folC, which was transformed to E. coli and isolated for subsequent introduction into L. lactis strain NZ9000 (27Kuipers O.P. de Ruyter P.G. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar). L. lactis transformants in which plasmids had integrated via single crossover were grown overnight in GM17 with 2 μg/ml erythromycin and plated on GM17 agar containing 2 μg/ml erythromycin and 80 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-galactopyranoside (X-gal). The orientation of the single crossover event was tested by PCR amplifications directly on cell material from a blue colony using the primers pORIc-ntr-F (sequence present downstream of multiple cloning site of pORI280) and folP-F (sequence present in folP but not the integration vector) (Table II). Subsequently, cells that contained the plasmid integrated over the short folP-flanking region were grown in medium without antibiotics and re-inoculated in the same medium to a density of ∼1–10 cells/ml. After growth for ∼30–40 generations, dilutions of the culture were plated on agar containing X-gal. After 48 h white colonies were selected, and the presence or absence of ylgG was determined by PCR amplification from cell material by using primers folP-F and folCXbaI-R (Table II).Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in ylgG inactivationStrain or plasmidRelevant characteristicsRef. or sourceStrainsL. lactis NZ9000MG1363 pepN:nisRK27Kuipers O.P. de Ruyter P.G.

Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using KOD polymerase (Novagen, Madison, WI) and the primers 5′-CATGCACCATGGATGAGGATTTGATTTCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCGCTCGAGTATGTTCTTATAACGATA-3′ (reverse), containing NcoI and XhoI sites, respectively. Using the NcoI site for cloning changed the second amino acid of YlgG from Asn to Asp. A full-length cDNA (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center U50379) served as template to amplify the At1g68760 coding sequence, using the primers 5′-ACCCACATGTCGACAGGAGAAGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCGCTCGAGGTCTCCACCACCATGAGT-3′ (reverse), containing AflIII and XhoI sites, respectively. The ylgG and At1g68760 amplicons were digested with appropriate enzymes and cloned between the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET-28b (Novagen), which added a hexahistidine tag to the C terminus. The sequence-verified constructs were electroporated into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®-RIL (DE3) cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For enzyme production, cells were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.5. Isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added (final concentration 1 mm) and incubation continued for 16 h at 25 °C. Protein Isolation and Molecular Mass Determination—E. coli cells from a 1-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m KCl (buffer A), and broken in a Mini-BeadBeater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) using 0.1-mm zirconia/silica beads. Protein purification by Ni2+-affinity chromatography under native conditions followed the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). All steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Purified proteins were desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated in buffer A. For YlgG, a second purification step was carried out using a Waters 626 high pressure liquid chromatography system. Proteins were loaded on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m NaCl (0.2 ml/min), and fractions with DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity were pooled. Purified proteins were stored at 4 °C for up to 6 months, which did not cause significant activity loss. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford's method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The native molecular mass of YlgG was estimated using a calibrated Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, using a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The standards were carbonic anhydrase, bovine serum albumin, β-amylase, apoferritin, and thyroglobin. Preparation of DHNTP—Recombinant E. coli GTP cyclohydrolase I (30Nar H. Huber R. Auerbach G. Fischer M. Ho ̈sl C. Ritz H. Bracher A. Meining W. Eberhardt S. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12120-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was used to prepare DHNTP. The reaction was run in 1.5 ml of 50 mm HEPES-KOH containing 0.1 m KCl (buffer B) plus 1 mm GTP, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 30 μg of purified GTP cyclohydrolase I for 2 h at 37 °C. DHNTP formation was followed by absorption at 330 nm until all GTP was converted; the molar extinction coefficient of DHNTP is 6300 m–1 cm–1 at 330 nm (31Bracher A. Eisenreich W. Schramek N. Ritz H. Gotze E. Herrmann A. Gutlich M. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28132-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The solution was then deproteinized using a Centricon YM-10 unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Aliquots containing 30–80 nmol of DHNTP were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C. After thawing, aliquots were used at once and not re-frozen. Enzyme Assays—Assays were routinely made in 50–200-μl reaction mixtures at 30 °C for 5–180 min in buffer B containing the specified concentrations of substrates and divalent metal ions (as chloride salts). The 0.1 m KCl in this buffer did not significantly affect enzymatic reactions. DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity was assayed by fluorometric HPLC. Reactions were stopped by adding oxidizing solution (0.5% I2, 1% KI, w/v, in 1 m HCl, 10 μl per 100-μl reaction mix) and incubating for 1 h at 4 °C. Then 10 μl of 2% sodium ascorbate and 4.1 μl of 1 m Na2HPO4, 1 m NaOH were added to destroy excess I2 and adjust the pH to 6.0, and denatured protein was pelleted. Separation of neopterin and its phosphates was basically as described (4Basset G. Quinlivan E.P. Ziemak M.J. Diaz De La Garza R. Fischer M. Schiffmann S. Bacher A. Gregory III, J.F. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12489-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using a Waters 2695 instrument (Waters, Milford, MA). Briefly, samples (20–50 μl) were injected on a C18 Synergi 4μ Fusion-RP 80 column (4 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and eluted isocratically with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at 1 ml/min. Peaks were detected using a Waters 2475 Multi λ Fluorescence Detector (excitation 350 nm, emission 450 nm) and quantified relative to neopterin monophosphate (Schircks). A neopterin diphosphate standard was prepared from DHNTP by acid phosphatase treatment and oxidation. Pyrophosphate was quantified using the Biomol Green™ phosphate detection reagent after addition of 1–2 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma) to enzymatic assays (32Xu W. Shen J. Dunn C.A. Desai S. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To measure NADH hydrolysis, samples (20 μl) were injected on a C18 symmetry column (3.5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Waters) and eluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 8 mm tetrabutylammonium bisulfate using a linear gradient from 12 to 30% methanol. The NMNH peak was quantified fluorometrically (excitation 340 nm, emission 460 nm) relative to authentic NMNH. Hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates and their 2′-deoxy derivatives was assayed by pyrophosphate release as described above. Reactions were stopped by adding either excess EDTA (2–3 times the quantity of M2+ ions) or the Biomol Green™ reagent. Hydrolysis of other substrates (Ap4A, Ap3A, NAD, ADP-ribose, UDP-glucose, and coenzyme A) was assayed by treating the reaction products with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) as described (32Xu W. Shen J. Dunn C.A. Desai S. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and determining phosphate with the Biomol Green™ reagent. Kinetic data were analyzed by direct fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression. Folate and Pteridine Analysis—Total folate was quantified using the Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay (33Horne D.W. Patterson D. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2357-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) after enzymatic deconjugation, as described previously (15Sybesma W. Starrenburg M. Kleerebezem M. Mierau I. de Vos W.M. Hugenholtz J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3069-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Pteridines were extracted from L. lactis cells in buffer C (0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 4.5, containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by HPLC. Briefly, cells of a 50-ml overnight culture (30 °C) were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer C, and broken in a Mini-BeadBeater. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C plus or minus 3 units of wheat germ acid phosphatase (Sigma). Acid hydrolysis conditions were used to avoid formation of cyclic DHNP, which is not attacked by phosphatase (4Basset G. Quinlivan E.P. Ziemak M.J. Diaz De La Garza R. Fischer M. Schiffmann S. Bacher A. Gregory III, J.F. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12489-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by adding 15 μl of oxidizing solution per 100-μl sample and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Then 15 μl of 2% sodium ascorbate and 6.1 μl of 1 m Na2HPO4, 1 m NaOH were added, and the samples were centrifuged and analyzed by HPLC as described above except that the flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. Inactivation of ylgG—The ylgG gene was inactivated in L. lactis strain NZ9000ΔylgG by double crossover recombination using modifications of a published method (26Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The NZ9000ΔylgG strain, which lacks 95% of the ylgG gene, had the same growth rate as the wild type on minimal (CDM) medium (Fig. 2A, inset). However, the mutant had intracellular folate levels 3-fold lower than the wild type and, unlike the wild type, secreted almost no folate to the medium (Fig. 2A). The complementation of ylgG into the NZ9000ΔylgG strain restored folate level to that of the wild type (not shown). These data indicate that YlgG mediates a step in folate biosynthesis. HPLC analysis showed this step to be dephosphorylation of DHNTP, for mutant cells accumulated a pteridine with the retention time of DHNTP (Fig. 2B) that gave dihydroneopterin (DHN) upon phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2B and Table III). (Pteridines were oxidized before HPLC to convert them to their fluorescent aromatic forms, so that DHN was analyzed as neopterin and DHNTP as neopterin triphosphate.) Two other features of Fig. 2B are noteworthy. First, the mutant cells accumulated dihydroneopterin di- and monophosphates as well as DHNTP, showing that sequential removal of single phosphate residues was occurring. Second, wild type cells contained 10-fold more DHNTP than dihydroneopterin, showing that the dephosphorylation process is far from equilibrium in vivo.Table IIIEffect of ylgG inactivation on intracellular pteridine levels in L. lactisIntracellular pteridine concentrationPteridineWild type NZ9000NZ9000ΔylgGUntreated+PhosphataseUntreated+PhosphataseμmNeopterin triphosphate0.33 ± 0.08<0.013.28 ± 0.65<0.01Neopterin0.03 ± 0.0020.43 ± 0.02<0.015.69 ± 0.22 Open table in a new tab Characterization of Recombinant YlgG—The ylgG open reading frame (Fig. 3A) was expressed in E. coli with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The expression level was insufficient to detect the recombinant YlgG in the total soluble protein fraction, but a polypeptide close to the predicted size (20.4 kDa, including the His tag) was readily isolated from this fraction by Ni2+ affinity and anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 4A). The purified YlgG constituted ∼0.2% of total soluble protein.Fig. 4Isolation, reaction products, and Mg2+ response of recombinant YlgG.A, SDS-PAGE of soluble proteins from E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®-RIL cells induced by isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (lane 1) and YlgG protein purified by Ni2+-affinity and anion exchange chromatography (lane 2).

This activity was dependent on Mg2+ and reached ∼70% of its maximal value at 1 mm (Fig. 4C). Because 1 mm is approximately the physiological level of free Mg2+ (11Chang C.F. Shuman H. Somlyo A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 935-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Igamberdiev A.U. Kleczkowski L.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this concentration was adopted for subsequent work. Ca2+ at 1 mm did not activate YlgG; Zn2+ and Mn2+ could not be tested as they caused rapid chemical breakdown of DHNTP (9Suzuki Y. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2405-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 1 mm Mg2+, chemical conversion of DHNTP to DHNP was almost undetectable (<0.5% of the maximal rate of the enzymatic reaction in Fig. 4C). This chemical conversion increased when Mg2+ or Ca2+ concentration was raised to 10–12 mm as reported (10De Saizieu A. Vankan P. van Loon A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but at these concentrations other major breakdown products were also formed (not shown). Kinetic characterization of YlgG (Table IV) gave a Km value for DHNTP (2.1 μm) that is among the lowest reported for Nudix enzymes and gave a fairly typical kcat value (0.21 s–1 at 30 °C) (34Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). YlgG had no detectable activity with GTP, ATP, TTP, CTP, the corresponding deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 8-oxo-dGTP, NADH, NAD+, diadenosine tri- or tetraphosphate, ADP-ribose, UDP-glucose, or coenzyme A (the detection limit was ≤1% of the activity with DHNTP). Consistent with this lack of activity, the YlgG amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A) does not have the motifs associated with specificity for NADH, diadenosine polyphosphates, ADP-ribose, or coenzyme A (35Dunn C.A.

The complex interplay between integrins and the cytoskeleton is regulated by specific signaling pathways that are not completely understood.The Rho family GTPases, particularly Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, modulate many aspects of cytoskeletal function that occur during migration (2Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 3Nobes C.D. Hall A. J.

Rac1 seems to be essential in most cells for the protrusion of lamellipodia at the leading edge and for forward cell movement. In contrast, RhoA is required to maintain substrate adhesion during cell movement and to produce contractile force in the forwarding migrating cell. The main function of Cdc42 is to maintain cell polarity and initiate the formation of filopodium.The role of individual Rho GTPases in migration may depend on cell type. The contribution of RhoA in motility has been established in specific cell types such as colon carcinoma cells, hepatoma cells, and lymphoma cells (7Stam J.C. Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A.

Med. 1999; 5: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, many studies on the role of Rho proteins in migration have used fibroblasts (10Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 11Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3795) Google Scholar). Other studies show that increased Rac activity promotes migration and invasion of lymphocytes (7Stam J.C. Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A. Moolenaar W.H. Collard J.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4066-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 12Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). For lung adenocarcinoma cells (13Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), Rac1 can inhibit the motility of epithelial cells because of an increase in the formation of cadherin junctional adhesions (14Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). High RhoA activity inhibits movement in fibroblasts and lung adenocarcinoma cells (13Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Thus, the balance among RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 activities will determine whether a given cell remains stationary or is migratory.It is well known that ECM proteins can trigger cell spreading and motility through integrin-dependent regulation of Rho family members. The type of ECM also appears to have dramatic effects on the migratory response of the cell. For example, in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, Rac activation enhanced migration on collagen but suppressed migration on laminin-1 or fibronectin substrates (16Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). During the initial phase of spreading on fibronectin, RhoA activity is reduced through activation of p190 RhoGAP as a result of Src and FAK signaling in fibroblasts (15Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 17Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, 18Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); subsequently, RhoA activity increases markedly (17Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Rac1 and Cdc42 activities are known to be high during spreading and membrane protrusion (19Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 20Cox E.A. Sastry S.K. Huttenlocher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Other ECM proteins, such as laminin-10/11 (13Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and laminin-8 (21Fujiwara H. Gu J. Sekiguchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), activate Rac1 to promote cell migration. However, α4β1 integrin interaction with fibronectin down-regulated RhoA activity and induced melanoma cell migration (22Moyano J.V. Maqueda A. Casanova B. Garcia-Pardo A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3699-3715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another important issue concerns differences between the behavior of cells studied on two-dimensional surfaces versus three-dimensional matrices (23DeMali K.A. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).Previously, we showed that for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, laminin-5 ligand promotes rapid cell scattering, whereas fibronectin and collagen I do not (24Kawano K. Kantak S.S. Murai M. Yao C.C. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the integrin-mediated regulation of Rho GTPases and their downstream effectors resulting from adhesion to laminin-5 and type I collagen substrates in SCC cells. On laminin-5 substrate, α3β1 integrin preferentially inactivated RhoA and induced activation of Cdc42 and PAK1, thereby promoting migration of oral SCC cells. In contrast, on type I collagen, α2β1 integrin strongly activated RhoA, leading to enhanced focal contact formation, thereby hindering cell migration. These results suggest that Rho signaling in SCC may be important in defining cell phenotype.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Y-27632 and C3 transferase were purchased from Calbiochem; myelin basic protein (MBP) and poly-l-lysine (PLL) were from Sigma; type I collagen was from Cohesion Technologies (Palo Alto, CA).

Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Cell Culture—Cells from the human SCC cell lines HSC-3 and UM-SCC-10A were maintained as described previously (24Kawano K. Kantak S.S. Murai M. Yao C.C. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in DMEM (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells used for adhesion and motility assays were serum-starved overnight.Purified laminin-5 was used as described previously for adhesion and motility assays (24Kawano K. Kantak S.S. Murai M. Yao C.C. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Zhang K. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Laminin-5 matrix substrate was derived from human SCC cells as described previously (24Kawano K. Kantak S.S. Murai M. Yao C.C. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown to confluence on tissue culture plates for 48 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were removed by treatment with 20 mm NH4OH for 5 min according to the method described previously (26Gospodarowicz D.J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1984; 145: 103-128PubMed Google Scholar, 27Langhofer M. Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 753-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The matrix was then extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline before use.Adenoviral Infection—Adenovirus encoding constitutively active RhoA (V14RhoA) or dominant-negative RhoA (N19RhoA) was kindly provided by A. Hassid (University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN). Adenovirus encoding GFP or dominant-negative Cdc42 (N17Cdc42) was a gift of G. E. Davis (Texas A&M University System, College Station, TX). Adenovirus encoding wild-type (WT) PAK1 or constitutively active PAK1 (E423 PAK1) was from W. T. Gerthoffer (University of Nevada, Reno, NV). HSC-3 cells were infected with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 500 in 1 ml of culture medium in 6-well plates or in 4 ml of culture medium in 10-cm plates. After 2 h incubation, 2 or 6 ml of DMEM was added to the 6-well or 10-cm plates, respectively. After 24 h in culture, cells were processed for experiments as described below.Inhibitor Treatments—For treatment with the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase, cells were preincubated with 5 μg/ml C3 transferase in serum-free medium overnight. For treatment with the Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632, cells were preincubated with 25 μm Y-27632 in DMEM for 30 min before and included during the experiments.Cell Spreading Measurements—Suspended cells were seeded onto plates previously coated with collagen I or laminin-5 substrate for the indicated times at 37 °C in serum-free medium. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were stained with 2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 10 min (15Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The relative areas in pixels of more than 20 individual cells were generated using Metamorph and NIH Image software. The average of the relative areas of cells plated on laminin-5 substrate for 30 min was chosen as the maximal cell area. The ratio of the cell area at the indicated time point to the maximal cell area was then determined.Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells were seeded onto chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) coated with collagen I or laminin-5 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilization with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-paxillin mAb or anti-vinculin mAb) for 1 h, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was used to co-stain polymerized actin filaments. Slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and viewed using a Nikon fluorescence microscope or a Bio-Rad Laboratories laser scanning confocal microscope (model MRC-1024).Immunoblotting—Cells were extracted with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm MgCl2, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and processed for SDS-PAGE after adjusting for equal protein loading, estimated by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), proteins were probed with primary antibodies and secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody. Blots were developed by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The band intensities were measured by densitometry using NIH Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion was measured as described previously (28Yao C.C. Ziober B.L. Squillace R.M. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25598-25603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with type I collagen (10 μg/ml) and laminin-5 (2.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by blocking with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. HSC-3 cells were incubated with or without blocking mAbs to integrin subunits for 30 min at 4 °C, and 2 × 104 cells were added to each well and allowed to attach for 20 min at 37 °C. Adherent cells were then quantified by a microcolorimetric assay (28Yao C.C. Ziober B.L. Squillace R.M. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25598-25603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Migration Assay—Time-lapse video microscopy was performed as described with a modification (29Denker S.P. Barber D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded onto 6-well plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware) coated with different substrates (collagen I (10 μg/ml), laminin-5 (5 μg/ml), or PLL (10 μg/ml)) for 30 min. Plates were then examined in a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope with an X-Y scanning motorized stage (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Images were collected at the indicated time intervals using a SPOT-RT CCD camera (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed with the Openlab software system (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA). The positions of individual nuclei were tracked to determine the relative migration rates.In the transwell migration assay, the undersides of the transwell (8-μm pore size; Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were precoated with collagen (10 μg/ml) and laminin-5 (0.5 or 1.25 μg/ml). Next, 2 × 105 cells were loaded onto the upper chamber of the transwell, and the lower chamber was filled with serum-free medium. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with crystal violet. Non-migrating cells retained on the upper side were removed by wiping with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated through the filter were counted and averaged from 10 randomly chosen microscopic fields using a ×20 objective. Migration was taken as 100% for cells infected with control virus.Invasion Assay—Polymerized type I collagen gels were prepared by overlaying 30 μl of DMEM containing 2.4 mg/ml type I collagen to the upper chamber of each transwell and allowing gelation at 37 °C for 1 h. Next, HSC-3 cells (2 × 105) in 200 μl of serum-free DMEM were added on top of the collagen gel. Serum-free medium was then added to the lower chamber and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Collagen gel and associated cells were removed with a cotton swab. Cells that had penetrated the collagen I gel and reached the underside of the filter membrane were then counted in 10 randomly chosen microscopic fields using a ×20 objective. For each experimental condition, three invasion chambers were used. The mean ± S.E. were determined. Data were expressed as the percentage of treated migratory cells compared with that of control cells.RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 Activity Assays—The construct expressing the Rho binding domain of ROCK fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was provided by M. A. Woodrow (University of California, San Francisco). The construct expressing PAK 75–132 fused to GST was a gift from P. N. Lowe (Medicines Research Center, GlaxoSmithKline, United Kingdom). Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified as described for pull-down assays (17Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar).Prior to the assay, cells were cultured under serum-free conditions overnight. Cells were plated on different substrates for the indicated times and were lysed in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation. For estimating RhoA activity, 40 μg of cell lysates was used to measure total RhoA, and 1.5 mg of cell lysates was mixed with 30 μg of GST-ROCK and 90 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 60 min at 4 °C. For estimating activity of Rac1 or Cdc42, 40 μg of cell lysates was used to measure total Rac1 or Cdc42, and 1.5 mg of cell lysates was mixed with 30 μg of GST-PAK and 90 μl of glutathione-agarose beads for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed, and bound protein was eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then immunoblotted with anti-RhoA mAb, anti-Rac1 mAb, or anti-Cdc42 mAb.Protein Kinase Assay—Serum-starved HSC-3 cells or WT PAK1-transduced cells were plated on collagen I or laminin-5 substrate for 30 min. Cell lysates were collected using lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.6% Triton X-100, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) as described by Royal et al. (30Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cell lysate (800 μg) was immunoprecipitated with anti-PAK1 (N-20) antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose (40% suspension) for a second 1-h incubation at 4 °C. The immune complex was washed twice with the lysis buffer and once with the kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin). The immunoprecipitated PAK1 activity was assayed using MBP as a substrate. The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of MBP, 100 μm cold ATP, and 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli sample buffer, followed by boiling. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following autoradiography, band intensities were measured by densitometry. PAK1 expression levels were evaluated by Western blotting with the anti-PAK1 (N-20) antibody.RESULTSEnhanced Cell Spreading and Motility on Laminin-5 Substrates—Previous studies using cell aggregates had revealed that, compared with collagen, fibronectin, and laminin-1, laminin-5 had the most potential to disrupt cell-cell adhesions and promote cell scattering (24Kawano K. Kantak S.S. Murai M. Yao C.C. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effects of type I collagen and laminin-5 on single cell spreading and migration. Cells were able to attach but spread slowly on type I collagen over the 30-min time period (Fig. 1A). On laminin-5 substrates, cells spread rapidly and were nearly fully spread by 20 min after seeding, whereas cells on collagen I showed only a partial spreading during this time period. In addition, cells displayed an array of lamellopodia and microspikes on the laminin-5 substrate but on type I collagen cells showed only small lamellopodia (Fig. 1B). The time course of adhesion of cells to type I collagen and laminin-5 was indistinguishable (data not shown).Next, the role of specific integrin receptors involved in mediating adhesion was determined using anti-integrin blocking antibodies. HSC-3 cells have significant levels of α2, α3, and α6 integrins and low levels of α5 and αv integrins (24Kawano K. Kantak S.S. Murai M. Yao C.C. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with anti-α2 or anti-β1 integrin antibody effectively blocked cell adhesion to type I collagen, whereas antibodies to α3 or α5 integrin was without effect. On laminin-5, treatment of cells with anti-α3 or anti-β1 integrin antibody inhibited cell adhesion (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, anti-α6 antibody had little inhibitory activity, suggesting that α6β1 and α6β4 integrins are not the dominant adhesion receptors for laminin-5 in these cells.Formation of Focal Adhesions on Type I Collagen and Laminin-5—To establish the role of substrate adhesions in migration, we seeded cells onto the different ECM ligands and then evaluated focal adhesion formation by immunofluorescent staining. On type I collagen, we found that cells formed a high density of large, mature focal adhesions strongly stained by paxillin or vinculin antibodies (Fig. 1D). However, on laminin-5 substrate, paxillin- or vinculin-positive focal adhesions were limited in number and poorly stained. When cells were costained with rhodamine-phalloidin, an extensive array of polymerized actin and stress fibers was visible on collagen I but was minimal on laminin-5 (data not shown).The ability of type I collagen and laminin-5 to promote cell migration was assessed using time-lapse video microscopy. Analysis of cell tracts revealed that although HSC-3 cells attached to type I collagen and the poly-l-lysine control, they migrated poorly on these substrates (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cells plated on laminin-5 showed a mostly random course of migration but moved at a rate severalfold greater than cells plated on type I collagen (Fig. 2, A and B). Another SCC cell line, UM-SCC-10A, responded similarly as HSC-3 cells to the two substrates (Fig. 2C). To evaluate the role of integrin receptors in HSC-3 cell migration, we performed motility assays in the presence of inhibitory antibodies. Blocking antibodies against integrin α3 or β1 most effectively inhibited cell movement on laminin-5, whereas blocking antibodies against integrin α2 and α6 had negligible effect on motility (Fig. 2D). Although α6β1 and α6β4 can act as receptors for laminin-5 (32Nguyen B.P. Ryan M.C. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and are both expressed on HSC-3 cells (31Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these integrins do not appear to be crucial for cell adhesion or migration. This indicates that α3β1 integrin is the primary receptor for adhesion to, and migration on, laminin-5. Importantly, these cells were mostly immobile on type I collagen but showed high rates of locomotion on laminin-5.Fig. 2Cell motility on different ECM substrates.A, HSC-3 cells were plated on type I collagen (Col I), laminin-5 (Ln-5) substrate, and PLL. Time-lapse images on different substrates were taken at 20-min intervals for 8 h. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% serum. Individual cell tracks are shown. B, the rate of cell migration on different substrates was estimated as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” C, HSC-3 cells and SCC-10A cells were plated on type I collagen and laminin-5 substrates in serum-free medium. Time-lapse images were taken at 20-min intervals for 3 h. Cell migration rates of eight tracked cells in each condition are shown. D, the effect of anti-integrin antibodies on cell migration on laminin-5 substrate. Cells were incubated without mAb (Control) or with control antibody (IgG) or with function perturbing mAbs to α2 (VM1), α3 (J143), α6 (GoH3), or β1 (AIIB2) and then plated on laminin-5 substrate, and migration was followed by time-lapse microscopy over a 3-h period. The average migration speed was determined. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of 10 tracked cells. E, cell morphology on collagen I and laminin 5 followed by time-lapse phase microscopy. On collagen I substrate (a), cells display little locomoti"

However, although proteolytic cleavage is sufficient for executioner caspases, a different mechanism has been recently proposed for initiator caspases, such as caspase-8, which are believed to be activated by proximity-induced dimerization. According to this model, dimerization rather than proteolytic processing is considered as the critical event for caspase-8 activation. Such a mechanism would suggest that in the absence of a dimerization platform such as the death-inducing signaling complex, caspase-8 proteolytic cleavage would result in an inactive enzyme. As several studies have described caspase-8 cleavage during mitochondrial apoptosis, we now investigated whether caspase-8 becomes indeed catalytically active in this pathway. Using an in vivo affinity labeling approach, we demonstrate that caspase-8 is activated in etoposide-treated cells in vivo in the absence of the receptor-induced death-inducing signaling complex formation. Furthermore, we show that both caspase-3 and -6 are required for the efficient activation of caspase-8. Our data therefore indicate that interchain cleavage of caspase-8 in the mitochondrial pathway is sufficient to produce an active enzyme even in the absence of receptor-driven procaspase-8 dimerization. Proteases of the caspase family are thought to be activated by proteolytic processing of their inactive zymogens. However, although proteolytic cleavage is sufficient for executioner caspases, a different mechanism has been recently proposed for initiator caspases, such as caspase-8, which are believed to be activated by proximity-induced dimerization. According to this model, dimerization rather than proteolytic processing is considered as the critical event for caspase-8 activation. Such a mechanism would suggest that in the absence of a dimerization platform such as the death-inducing signaling complex, caspase-8 proteolytic cleavage would result in an inactive enzyme. As several studies have described caspase-8 cleavage during mitochondrial apoptosis, we now investigated whether caspase-8 becomes indeed catalytically active in this pathway. Using an in vivo affinity labeling approach, we demonstrate that caspase-8 is activated in etoposide-treated cells in vivo in the absence of the receptor-induced death-inducing signaling complex formation. Furthermore, we show that both caspase-3 and -6 are required for the efficient activation of caspase-8. Our data therefore indicate that interchain cleavage of caspase-8 in the mitochondrial pathway is sufficient to produce an active enzyme even in the absence of receptor-driven procaspase-8 dimerization. Caspases, a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, play an essential role in the signal transduction and effector processes of apoptosis (1Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar, 2Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K.

In healthy cells, caspases exist as inactive proforms (zymogens) consisting of a prodomain followed by two catalytically active subunits that are separated by a short linker domain. Upon activation, the prodomain is removed, and the linker domain is cleaved off resulting in the generation of the mature caspase, an active heterotetramer formed out of two large p20 and two small p10 subunits (6Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 7Degterev A. Boyce M. Yuan J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8543-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Based on their order in cell death pathways, caspases can be divided into initiator and downstream effector caspases. Effector caspases, such as caspase-3, -6, and -7, generally contain only a small prodomain and cleave diverse cellular substrates (8Fischer U. Ja ̈nicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The initiator caspases such as caspase-8, -9, and -10, in contrast, contain a long prodomain that is used to recruit the enzymes to high molecular weight activation platforms, including the apoptosome in the mitochondrial pathway or the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) 1The abbreviations used are: DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; AMC, aminomethylcoumarin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. in the death receptor pathway (9Green D.R.

Caspase-8 is a key mediator of apoptotic signals triggered by death receptors such as CD95, TNF-R1, and TRAIL-R1/TRAIL-R2. In the case of the TRAIL receptors and CD95, caspase-8 is directly recruited into the DISC by the adapter protein FADD (11Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Los M. Wesselborg S. Peter M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 439-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 12Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Signaling through TNF-R1, in contrast, appears to be more complex and to proceed via two sequential complexes (13Harper N. Hughes M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25534-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). It was suggested that following TNF stimulation a first complex is formed at the cell membrane, which contains TNF-R1, the adapter protein TRADD, and the NF-κB-activating signaling components RIP and TRAF2. Then, complex I leaves the receptor, and a second complex is formed in the cytosol, which recruits FADD and caspase-8 and induces cell death. In contrast to the executioner caspases that are found in the cytosol as inactive dimers, the initiator caspases are present as inactive monomers. Although executioner caspases are activated by direct proteolytic cleavage, initiator caspases are thought to require more complex activation events. Initially, receptor-driven oligomerization of caspase-8 was thought to activate this enzyme through facilitating the autoproteolysis of procaspase-8 molecules (15Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, have proposed that dimerization rather than interchain proteolysis is the critical event for activation of initiator caspases. It was suggested that dimerization is sufficient and a prerequisite for the activation of caspase-8 and -9, whereas proteolytic processing merely stabilizes the active caspase dimers (16Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandino S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 11: 543-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, it was shown that chemically induced dimerization of a non-cleaveable caspase-8 mutant yielded in an active procaspase-8 dimer that exhibited the same cleavage activity as the wild-type mature heterotetramer in vitro (17Donepudi M. Mac Sweeney A. Briand C. Grutter M.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 543-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 18Chang D.W. Ditsworth D. Liu H. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S.

However, although the current experimental observations would support this model, most of the evidence was gathered in artificial systems that might not reflect the correct in vivo situation (20Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 855-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Various studies have proposed that caspase-8 is not only activated in the death receptor pathway, but can be also activated independently of death receptors, for instance during genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis (21Ferrari D.

During stress-induced apoptosis triggered by anti-cancer drugs or ionizing irradiation, it was proposed that caspase-8 activation is mediated in a postmitochondrial event by the prior cleavage through caspase-6 (29Cowling V. Downward J. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In all these studies, the proteolysis of caspase-8 has been considered sufficient evidence for the activation of caspase-8 that was proposed to trigger a feedback amplification loop through the cleavage of Bid (23Engels I.H. Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Lauber K. Berg C. Schwenzer R. Wajant H. Ja ̈nicke R.U. Porter A.G. Belka C. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S.

Hence, in such a death receptor-independent activation pathway, caspase-8 was proposed to act as an executioner caspase. These studies, however, could not distinguish whether caspase-8 processing resulted in the gain of enzymatic activity or merely reflected a substrate cleavage event. Moreover, activation through interchain cleavage would be incompatible with the recent proximity-induced dimerization model, which should result in a processed but catalytically inactive caspase-8 monomer. To address the question whether caspase-8 becomes indeed catalytically active in the mitochondrial death pathway, we now employed an in vivo affinity labeling approach using the biotinylated caspase-inhibitor biotin-VAD-fmk that only detects active caspases. We demonstrated that caspase-8 is indeed activated independently of death receptors and that both caspase-6 and -3 are required for the generation of the mature caspase-8 enzyme. Cell Lines and Reagents—All cell lines including MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, the leukemic T cell lines Jurkat and H9, and human B lymphoblastoid SKW6.4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 0.1 mg of streptomycin/ml (all from PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria). The CD95-resistant Jurkat subline, Jurkat-R, was generated by continuous culture in the presence of anti-CD95 mAb (1 μg/ml, BioCheck, Münster, Germany) for 6 months (22Wesselborg S. Engels I.H. Rossmann E. Los M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3053-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FADD- and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells as well as Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 were kindly provided by J. Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and H. Walczak (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. Biotin-VAD-fmk (biotin-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone) and biotin-DEVD-CHO (biotin-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde) were purchased from ICN (Eschwege, Germany) and Calbiochem. The caspase-3 substrate DEVD-AMC (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin) and the caspase-8 substrate IETD-AMC (N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin) were from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Etoposide was obtained from Sigma. The following antibodies were used for Western blotting or immunoprecipitation: goat antibodies recognizing caspase-3 or Bid (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany), mouse anti-caspase-8 (clone 12F5, BioCheck), mouse anti-caspase-8 (clone C15, Alexis, Lausen, Switzerland), and goat anti-caspase-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoblot analysis, horse-radish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies against mouse or goat IgG were purchased from Bio-Rad and Calbiochem. Measurement of Apoptosis—For the determination of apoptosis, 5 × 104 cells/well were seeded in microtiter plates and treated for the indicated time with anti-CD95 mAb or etoposide. The leakage of fragmented DNA from apoptotic nuclei was measured by the method of Nicoletti et al. (34Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Briefly, apoptotic nuclei were prepared by lysing cells in a hypotonic lysis buffer (1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide) and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. Nuclei to the left of the 2N peak containing hypodiploid DNA were considered apoptotic. Flow cytometric analyses were performed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest analysis software. In Vivo Labeling of Active Caspases—To label the active site of caspases, 2 × 107 cells were incubated following apoptosis induction for an additional hour with 10 μm biotin-VAD-fmk. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and extracted in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin (each 2 μg/ml), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The biotinylated proteins were captured on 30 μl of streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Calbiochem). After overnight rotation at 4 °C the agarose beads were extensively washed in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 60 μl of SDS-sample buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 10 min. 25 μgofthe cell extracts or 25 μl of the eluted biotinylated proteins were used for SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Fluorometric Cleavage Assay—After apoptosis induction, cell extracts were prepared from 1 × 107 cells in 500 μl of lysis buffer without dithiothreitol. For the precipitation, 2 μg of antibody (anti-caspase-8, anti-caspase-3) and 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) were added to the extracts and rotated for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were extensively washed in lysis buffer and then used for fluorometric caspase assays or analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For the fluorometric cleavage assay, 50 μg of the cell extracts or the beads were suspended in 200 μl of substrate buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 50 μm IETD- or DEVD-AMC. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and measured in a Lambda Fluro 320 Plus fluorometer (Biotek, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany). In Vitro Cleavage and Affinity Labeling of Caspase-8—Recombinant His-tagged caspase-3 was generated as described (35Lauber K. Appel H.A. Schlosser S.F. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29772-29781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). His-tagged caspase-6 was produced by the transformation of Escherichia coli BL21 gold with the pET23[casp6] plasmid (35Lauber K. Appel H.A. Schlosser S.F. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29772-29781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and induction of protein expression with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. One unit of caspase-6 was defined as the cleavage of 1 μmol of IETD-AMC/min at 37 °C. Cytosolic extracts from 1 × 107 wild-type or FADD-deficient Jurkat cells, MCF-7 or MCF-7/casp-3 cells, were prepared in 200 μl of lysis buffer and diluted with 600 μl of substrate buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The cleavage reaction was incubated at 37 °C after addition of the recombinant caspases at the indicated amounts. 25-μg aliquots of the reaction mixture were then taken in 30-min intervals and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis. For affinity labeling of caspase-8 following in vitro caspase cleavage, the non-methylated agent biotin-DEVD-CHO was used. Caspase-8 from Jurkat cell lysates was cleaved with caspase-3 and -6 for 2 h as described above. After the removal of the His-tagged recombinant caspases with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), the supernatant was incubated for 1 h with biotin-DEVD-CHO. Biotinylated proteins were captured with streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads and used for immunoblotting with anti-caspase-8 antibodies. Treatment of Jurkat Cells with Anti-CD95 or Etoposide Results in Caspase-8 Processing—To examine whether the caspase-8 processing that was observed following anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis also results in the generation of catalytically active caspase-8 molecules, we employed the Jurkat T-cell line that is a commonly used and established cellular model system for the elucidation of apoptotic pathways. First, we determined the time-dependent induction of apoptosis using the anti-cancer drug etoposide and as a control the agonistic CD95 antibody. As expected, both agents efficiently induced apoptosis of Jurkat wild-type cells, whereas only etoposide but not anti-CD95 was able to trigger apoptosis in Jurkat-R cells, a subclone that had lost CD95 expression, or in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A). Etoposide-induced cell death proceeded with similar kinetics in all Jurkat subclones confirming previous reports (22Wesselborg S. Engels I.H. Rossmann E. Los M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3053-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Engels I.H. Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Lauber K. Berg C. Schwenzer R. Wajant H. Ja ̈nicke R.U. Porter A.G. Belka C. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4563-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and indicating that etoposide-induced cell death proceeds independently of death receptors. Apoptosis induction in Jurkat wild-type cells (Fig. 1B) as well as in the CD95-resistant counterparts (see Fig. 3) was accompanied by the processing of caspase-8 and -3. Interestingly, whereas triggering of the death receptor pathway by the agonistic CD95 antibody resulted in the appearance of both a p16 and a p18 caspase-8 fragment, etoposide treatment produced only the p16 subunit (Fig. 1B). Although it was shown that caspase-8 processing in Jurkat cells that are classified as so-called type II cells results first in the generation of the p16 fragment before the p18 subunit appears (36Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), the exact reason for the lack of the p18 caspase-8 fragment in etoposide-treated cells is presently unknown. It is, however, tempting to speculate that the appearance of the p16 fragment is closely associated with activation of the mitochondrial pathway, whereas the generation of the p18 fragment requires DISC formation.Fig. 3In vivo peptide affinity labeling of active caspases during apoptosis. Jurkat wild-type cells (type II, A), H9 cells (type I, B) as well as Jurkat subclones deficient in CD95 (Jurkat-R), FADD (C), or caspase-8 (D), or Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 (D) were left untreated or stimulated with anti-CD95 (1 μg/ml, 5 h) or etoposide (100 μm, 9 h). After the incubation period, active caspases were labeled in vivo by the addition of biotin-VAD(OMe)-fmk. Cell extracts were prepared (input lane), and the biotinylated proteins were captured with streptavidin-agarose beads (streptavidin lane). The streptavidin beads and 25 μg of protein from the remaining supernatant and input were separated by SDS-PAGE and assayed for the activation of caspase-8 and -3 by Western blotting. For the detection of the streptavidin-captured intermediate p41/43 form of caspase-8 from H9 cells, a longer exposure time of the film was required, which is shown in a separate section of the gel. Asterisks denote nonspecific protein bands that are detected by the caspase-8 antibody also in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoprecipitation of Caspase-8 and -3—Having established the conditions for anti-CD95- and etoposide-induced apoptosis and caspase processing, we wanted to assess whether proteolytic processing of caspase-8 in etoposide-treated cells produced the catalytically active enzyme. Therefore, we first analyzed the cleavage of the preferred caspase-8 substrate, IETD-AMC, in extracts of anti-CD95-treated Jurkat cells. As expected, those extracts displayed a significant increase in cleavage activity of both IETD-AMC and DEVD-AMC, the preferred caspase-3 substrates (Fig. 2A). However, although the DEVD-AMC cleavage activity was substantially reduced following caspase-3 immunodepletion, indicating that caspase-3 is indeed the main DEVD cleaving caspase, depletion of caspase-8 resulted only in a slight reduction of IETD-AMC cleavage activity (Fig. 2A). In addition, the depletion of caspase-3 had a reproducibly even stronger impact on IETD-AMC cleavage activity than the depletion of caspase-8 itself. This is probably because of the fact that caspase-3 can efficiently cleave IETD-AMC as well as to our observation that the active p16/p18 caspase-8 fragment was co-precipitated with caspase-3 (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, no caspase-3 was detected in immunoprecipitates of caspase-8 (Fig. 2B). Together, these results indicate that measurement of the IETD-cleavage activity in whole apoptotic cell extracts does not allow us to exactly determine the contribution of caspase-8 as also other caspases, such as caspase-3 and -6, are able to cleave this substrate (37Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruelm R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Although these caspases do not cleave IETD-AMC as efficiently as caspase-8, they are activated in considerably larger amounts and have a higher specific activity and therefore cleave a substantial proportion of the IETD-AMC substrate (38Faleiro L. Kobayashi R. Fearnhead H. Lazebnik Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To more directly assess the catalytic competence of caspase-8 in apoptotic cells, caspase-8 and as a control also caspase-3 were immunoprecipitated from untreated and anti-CD95-treated Jurkat cells and tested directly in the substrate cleavage assay. Surprisingly, whereas immunoprecipitated caspase-3 exhibited significant DEVD-AMC as well as IETD-AMC cleavage activity when compared with the cleavage activity obtained from whole apoptotic cell extracts, immunoprecipitated caspase-8 was only slightly more active than untreated control extract (Fig. 2A). The failure of immunoprecipitated caspase-8 to convincingly cleave IETD-AMC was not because of an inefficient precipitation, as both antibodies used almost completely precipitated the full-length caspase zymogens as well as the proteolytically processed fragments of caspase-8 and -3, respectively (Fig. 2B). Also the general procedure of the immunoprecipitation technique does not seem to inhibit caspase activity as, firstly, caspase-3 precipitates were fully active (Fig. 2A), and, secondly, addition of either the caspase-8 antibody or protein G-Sepharose to cell extracts of anti-CD95-stimulated Jurkat cells changed neither IETD-AMC nor DEVD-AMC cleavage activity (data not shown). Even when we used two additional monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that successfully precipitated caspase-8, we were not able to detect significant IETDase activity in these precipitates (data not shown). Our observation is consistent with findings from another group 2M. E. Peter, personal communication. but in slight contrast to a very recent report (39Murphy B.M. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36916-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These authors demonstrated IETDase activity of precipitated caspase-8; however, only precipitated caspase-8 from untreated and apoptotic cell extracts were compared without relating these activities to the activity of the complete apoptotic lysates. Nevertheless, based on our results, the immunoprecipitation technique does not seem to be suitable for the determination of whether caspase-8 is active or not, at least in our hands. It appears that this technique captures either only inactive subunits or that caspase-8 is rendered inactive during the precipitation procedure, perhaps through an induced conformational change or due to the failure to precipitate other components that might be required for its activity. Etoposide-generated Caspase-8 Fragments Are Active—To circumvent the problems using the immunoprecipitation procedure, we employed an alternative approach by labeling apoptotic cells in vivo with the biotinylated caspase inhibitor VAD-fmk (biotin-VAD-fmk). This inhibitor easily penetrates cell membranes and only binds active caspases that can then be captured using streptavidin-conjugated-agarose beads. Jurkat cells were first treated with either the anti-CD95 antibody or with etoposide followed by incubation for an additional hour in the presence of biotin-VAD-fmk. The detection of the active caspase-3 fragments (p21/p19/p17/p12) induced by both death stimuli served as a positive control for the induction of apoptosis as well as for the efficient labeling and isolation procedure of the active caspases (Fig. 3A, lower panels). No active caspase-3 subunits were pulled down from untreated control cells, validating the specificity of this technique. Most importantly, biotin-VAD-fmk-labeled caspase-8 fragments were present in extracts of anti-CD95-treated as well as in etoposide-treated Jurkat cells indicating that both death stimuli generate active caspase-8 (Fig. 3A, upper and middle panels). Consistent with our results shown in Fig. 1, etoposide treatment resulted only in the generation of the p16 caspase-8 fragment, whereas both the p16 and the p18 fragments could be detected in cells treated with the agonistic CD95 antibody (Fig. 3A, middle panels). Similar results were also obtained in type 1 cells such as H9 (Fig. 3B) or SKW cells (data not shown) as well as in CD95- or FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 3C), supporting our hypothesis that only the generation of the active p18 caspase-8 fragment requires DISC formation. Also the p41/p43 caspase-8 fragments that were generated by both death stimuli were, at least partially, labeled by biotin-VAD-fmk suggesting that also these intermediate forms represent active caspase-8 (Fig. 3, upper panels). This finding is in agreement with several reports demonstrating that active initiator caspases are already generated via dimerization or oligomerization events even in the absence of complete processing of their proforms (16Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandino S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol.

However, considering that the input lanes contain approximately only 5% of the protein amount used for the pull downs in the respective streptavidin-captured lanes, very little active caspase-8 p41/p43 fragments could be detected. This is further emphasized by the observation that the relative amounts of the p41/p43 caspase-8 fragments before (input) and after (supernatant) the pull down did not differ significantly from each other, demonstrating that the majority of the caspase-8 intermediate fragments are not active regardless of whether they were generated following DISC or apoptosome formation (Fig. 3, upper panels). Biotin-VAD-fmk-labeled and hence active caspase-8 fragments were also detected in etoposide-treated CD95- and FADD-deficient Jurkat cell lines (Fig. 3C) but not in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 3D) These results not only verify the specificity of our pull-down experiments but also demonstrate clearly that caspase-8 can be activated via the mitochondrial death pathway independently from death receptor signaling and DISC formation. In addition, these results also argue against an involvement of FADD in the mitochondrial pathway acting perhaps as a scaffolding protein in a secondary activation complex, as it was suggested for apoptosis induction through TNF receptor-1 (14Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). Both Caspase-3 and -6 Are Required to Generate the p16 Caspase-8 Fragment—So far our data provide strong evidence that direct interchain proteolysis of caspase-8 most likely in the absence of a death receptor-mediated dimerization platform is sufficient to produce active caspase-8. In the mitochondrial pathway, caspase-8 is believed to be proteolytically processed and thereby activated by caspase-6 (29Cowling V. Downward J. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 40Slee E.A Adrain C. Martin S.J.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, all of these reports could only detect the p41/p43 intermediate caspase-8 fragments but failed to convincingly demonstrate the presence of the p16/p18 caspase-8 fragments following incubation with caspase-6. In contrast, another report concluded that caspase-6, at least in vitro, does not activate caspase-8, because the caspase-6-generated p41/p43 caspase-8 fragments were not labeled by biotin-VAD-fmk (16Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandino S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Based on our present results demonstrating that only the p16/p18 caspase-8 fragments were successfully labeled by biotin-VAD-fmk, whereas the p41/p43 intermediate fragments of caspase-8 were only labeled very weakly, we next analyzed the caspases that are responsible for the generation of the large p16 subunit of caspase-8. For this purpose, we incubated cell extracts from untreated Jurkat cells with either caspase-6 or -3 alone or with a combination of both. Remarkably, although either caspase alone was able to proteolytically process caspase-8 to yield the p41/p43 intermediate fragments, the p16 caspase-8 fragment was only very barely detectable (in the case of caspase-6) or not at all (in the case of caspase-3) (Fig. 4A). When both caspase-6 and -3, however, were added to Jurkat cell extract, an efficient generation of the p16 caspase-8 subunit could be observed suggesting that both caspases are required for the activation of caspase-8 in vitro (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with extracts of FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, incubation of the cell extracts with caspase-3 and -6 not only resulted in the correct processing but also in the generation of caspase-8 fragments that could be affinity-labeled with the biotinylated caspase substrate (Fig. 4A, right panel). The hypothesis that both caspase-3 and -6 are required for the activation of caspase-8 was verified by employing MCF-7 cells that harbor a functional deletion in the CASP-3 gene and hence are deficient for caspase-3 protein expression (42Ja ̈nicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Similar to the results described above (Fig. 4, A and B), the p16 caspase-8 fragment was generated in MCF-7 cell extracts in the presence of both recombinant caspases (caspase-6 and -3), whereas caspase-6 alone only generated the p41/p43 fragments (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, caspase-6 alone was sufficient to produce the p16 caspase-8 fragment in extracts of MCF-7 cells stably expressing caspase-3 further supporting our hypothesis that both caspase-3 and -6 are required. Finally, we analyzed the hierarchical caspase activation profile in etoposide-induced apoptosis and found that the processing of caspases as well as the cleavage of Bid were induced in Jurkat and FADD-deficient Jurkat cells but were completely abrogated in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 (Fig. 4D). Consistent with this we also observed that streptavidin-captured biotin-VAD-fmk did not recover any active caspase-8 or -3 fragments from these cells (Fig. 3D). Together these data not only demonstrate that the etoposide-induced activation of caspase-8 depends entirely on caspases that are activated in a postmitochondrial event such as caspase-3 and -6 but thereby also argue against an involvement of caspase-2 that was recently implicated as an initiator caspase acting upstream of mitochondria in drug-induced apoptosis (43Lin C.-F. Chen C.-L. Chang W.-T. Jan M.-S. Hsu L.-J. Wu R.-W. Tang M.-J. Chang W.-C. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40755-40761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells deficient of caspase-8 Bid cleavage occurred to an almost similar extent as in wild-type cells (Fig. 4D). This observation is mostly likely because of the fact that in comparison to caspase-8, Jurkat cells abundantly express caspase-3, which was shown to efficiently cleave Bid (25Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 40Slee E.A Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the susceptibility of Bid to cleavage by caspase-8 and -3 appears to be cell-type specific and differentially regulated by posttranslational modifications (44Desagher S. Osen-Sand A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15749-15757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, even though postmitochondrial activation of caspase-8 did not strongly affect Bid cleavage in our system, it might constitute a mitochondrial amplification loop by augmenting Bid cleavage and cytochrome c release in particular in response to a weak apoptotic signal. Indeed, such a positive postmitochondrial feedback loop has been recently proposed for several cell types in studies investigating the proteolytic processing of caspase-8 during death receptor-independent apoptosis (28Tang D. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9303-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 40Slee E.A Adrain C. Martin S.J.

Commun. 2003; 306: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Together our data demonstrated that interchain processing of caspase-8 in the absence of DISC formation, a process that occurs during the mitochondrial death pathway in vivo, is indeed sufficient to produce active caspase-8 enzyme. Thus, it is valid to conclude that the appearance of caspase-8 fragments observed in numerous death receptor-independent apoptosis systems correlates with its activity. During the preparation of our paper, Murphy et al. (39Murphy B.M. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36916-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that direct proteolysis of caspase-8 by the CTL protease granzyme B produces an active enzyme in vitro that displays proteolytic activity toward synthetic as well as natural caspase-8 substrates. Our results are not only supportive but further extend this finding as we show that active caspase-8 is generated during etoposide-induced apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, we show that both executioner caspases, caspase-3 and -6 are required to process and thereby activate caspase-8 in vitro, supporting the idea that a similar process occurs also in vivo during the course of the mitochondrial death pathway. As the p41/p43 caspase-8 fragments were much more efficiently generated in the presence of caspase-6, it seems plausible that caspase-6 preferentially cleaves the linker domain between the large and small subunit of caspase-8, whereas caspase-3 removes preferentially the prodomain. Although our data do not reveal whether the observed caspase-8 fragments following etoposide treatment in vivo are active as a dimer or monomer, the observation that substrate binding promotes the formation of caspase-8 dimers supports the former view (17Donepudi M. Mac Sweeney A. Briand C. Grutter M.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 543-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Finally, our results argue against an involvement of the DISC adapter protein FADD further supporting our view of a death receptor-independent activation of caspase-8 via the caspase-3- and -6-mediated interchain proteolysis. We thank Dr. J. Blenis for his gift of the FADD- and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells and Drs. I. Schmitz, U. Fischer, and F. Essmann for helpful comments."

Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is unusual that it resides in two distinct subcellular compartments, the trans-Golgi network and the cell surface (2.Shur B.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 854-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3.Youakim A. Dubois D.H. Shur B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10913-10917Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the trans-Golgi complex, GalT I is one of the key enzymes involved in the sugar chain synthesis that catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-Gal to terminal N-acetylglucosamine, forming the Galβ1→4GlcNAc structure (4.Furukawa K. Sato T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cell surface GalT I acts as a recognition molecule and participates in a number of cellular interactions, including neurite extension, cell growth, sperm-egg interaction, cell spreading, and migration (5.Gong X. Dubois D.H. Miller D.J. Shur B.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6.Maillet C.M. Shur B.D. J.

Neoplasms undergo various changes in the carbohydrate moieties of their glycoconjugates, which indicate that the glycosyltransferases themselves may change in malignancies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the importance of specific sialyltransferases, fucosyltransferases, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in tumorigenesis, and metastasis has been demonstrated (10.Dall'Olio F. Chiricolo M. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11.Narimatsu H. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 1998; 43: 2394-2403PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of oligosaccharides in metastasis is presently unknown, accumulated evidence has shown that a number of highly metastatic murine and human cell lines are characterized by the elevated levels of cell surface GalT I (13.Passaniti A. Hart G.W. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7261-7271PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Penno M.B. Passaniti A. Fridman R. Hart G.W. Jordan C. Kumar S. Scott A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6057-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In seven of eight human adrenal carcinoma cell lines, the levels of GalT I correlate with their relative degree of in vitro invasiveness. Additionally, in two B16 murine melanoma sublines with distinct in vivo metastatic abilities, cell surface GalT I activity is elevated in the highly metastatic variant. Moreover, the degree of metastasis is actually influenced by the relative expression of cell surface GalT I (15.Johnson F.M. Shur B.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2785-2795PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing cell surface GalT I expression in cells of low metastatic potential promoted their invasive potential in vitro, and decreasing the cell surface GalT I expression in highly metastatic cells reduced their invasive potential in vitro and metastatic potential in vivo. In a nude mouse model, the number of peritoneal dissemination foci of the antisense GalT I-transfected ovarian tumor cells was smaller than that of the control cells, which indicated that GalT I was involved in the invasive and metastatic potentials of ovarian cancer (16.Yamashita H. Kubushiro K. Ma J. Fujii T. Tsukazaki K. Iwamori M. Nozawa S. Oncol. Rep. 2003; 10: 1857-1862PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which GalT I activity is differentially up-regulated in highly metastatic cells is still unknown. Metastasis of cancer cells is a complex process involving multiple steps (17.Fidler I.J. Balch C.M. Curr. Probl. Surg. 1987; 24: 129-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Metastatic characteristics are partly derived from the deregulation of genes whose normal role is to control the division, differentiation, and migration of embryonic cells (18.Aznavoorian S. Murphy A.N. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Liotta L.A. Cancer. 1993; 71: 1368-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The Ets transcription factor family has been reported to be involved in tumor metastasis through enhancement of angiogenesis and the expression of genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor, urokinase plasminogen activator, matrix metalloproteases, and integrins in a variety of cancer cell lines and tumor tissues (19.Oikawa T. Yamada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 303: 11-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 20.Dittmer J. Mol. Cancer. 2003; 2: 29-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21.Habelhah H. Okada F.

Recent studies demonstrated that Ets-1 played a significant role in regulating N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V expression in a variety of cancer cells and might be involved in tumor metastasis via the up-regulation of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (22.Ko J.H.

Amplification was carried out for 22–27 cycles under saturation, each at 94 °C, 45 s; 60 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 1 min in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl each cDNA, 0.2 μm each primer, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase. After amplification, 10 μl of each reaction mixture was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands were then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The PCR products for GalT I were 1197 bp. Preparation of cDNA Probe and Northern Blot Analysis—To prepare the GalT I cDNA probe, RT-PCR products were separated and recovered from agarose electrophoresis. After purification and quantification, it was labeled with [32P]dATP, using a Prime-A-Gene random primer labeling kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (25.Ji S.Y. Zhu X.Y. Chen S. Shen A.G. Yin X.L. Chen C. Yao L.Y. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 252: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μg of total RNA was separated on formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond™N+ nylon membrane. The membranes were hybridized with a GalT I fragment as the probe and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment as an internal control. The blotted membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) with an intensifying screen at –80 °C for 72 h. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear proteins were isolated according to the method of Schreiber et al. (26.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6431Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF) on ice for 15 min, and then 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. After centrifugation, the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF), and the tubes were vortexed at 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined by using the method of Lowry et al. (27.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 30 μg of protein from each sample was electrophoresed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with TBS containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 three times, each for 5 min, the membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then developed by using the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection systems. Immunoprecipitation of β1 Integrin—The cultured cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed by the addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF). Cell lysate containing 500 μg of protein (determined by the method of Lowry) was incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal antibody to β1 integrin at 4 °C for 1 h. Then 20 μl of Protein G Plus-agarose suspension was added, and the sample was further incubated at 4 °C for 3 h to immunoprecipitate the integrin, followed by centrifugation and washing of the pellet. Finally, the protein of β1 integrin samples was adjusted to the same concentration (30 μg/ml). The immunoprecipitated integrin subunits were treated with neuraminidase to remove the terminal sialic acids of the N-glycans on the integrins by using a routine method in our laboratory. After washing, the 0.45-μg sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, then transferred to a PVDF membrane, and treated with 1:300 HRP-RCA1 conjugate or 1:1000 diluted antibody to β1 integrin followed by a 1:500 HRP-labeled secondary antibody. Finally, the membrane was developed with ECL reagents, and the membrane was put under x-ray film for exposure. Lectin Blotting—Cells were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cell lysates containing 30 μg of protein were boiled in SDS sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol, loaded on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. After being blocked with 5% BSA, the membrane was incubated with 1:100 dilution of HRP-RCA1 for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed and developed with the ECL detection system using x-ray film. RNA Interference Assay—RNA interference was undertaken using the pSilencer2.0 vector (Ambion Inc.). RNA interference target sequences were selected from the human GalT I sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number Y09723). Each candidate target sequence was analyzed by BLAST search to ensure that the hit would be unique to the GalT I mRNA. Target oligonucleotides were synthesized (AL1, 5′-AAGGCCGAGATCAGCAAAGTTCAAGAGACTTTGCTGATCTCGGCCTTTTTTTT-3′; and AL2, 5′-AATTAAAAAAAAGGCCGAGATCAGCAAAGTCTCTTGAACTTTGCTGATCTCGGCCTTGGCC-3′), annealed, and cloned into pSilencer vector between the BamHI and HindIII sites. Recombinant plasmid DNA was prepared and tested for silencing activity against a GalT I-myc chimeric mRNA expressed from myc-pcDNA3.1 (Clontech) as an N-terminal fusion of GalT I with Myc. A negative control vector comprising a scrambled sequence was also prepared. The increasing amounts of siGalT constructs were cotransfected with myc-pcDNA3.1-GalT1 and EGFPN1 (Clontech) into COS1 cells or PGLH7 cells. 48 h later, lysates were prepared, and the levels of Myc and GFP were examined by immunoblotting. Specificity was assessed either by using the empty vector pSilencer plasmid, a vector containing an unrelated insert, or by cotransfecting siGalT with myc-pcDNA3.1-HBO1 vector. Promoter Deletion Constructs—A 1705-bp fragment (containing nucleotides –1653 to +52) of GalT I promoter was prepared by PCR amplification of human genomic DNA using a sense primer containing an XhoI restriction site and an antisense primer containing a HindIII restriction site. Primers were synthesized on the basis of the reported genomic sequence for human GalT I, forward 5′-GTCTCGAGGTGTGTAAGGAGTAGGTTGCTGAG-3′ and reverse 5′-ATAAGCTTGCTTTAAGAAGGGTGTGGGCTACAG-3′. Genomic DNA extracted from human peripheral blood was used as a PCR template. Following digestion with restriction enzymes, the GalT I promoter fragment was directionally cloned into the pGL2-Basic firefly luciferase expression vector (Promega) to generate a “full-length” GalT I reporter construct, and the correct insertion was confirmed by sequencing. Reporter genes containing sequentially truncated fragments (–930/+52, –571/+52, –495/+52, –318/+52, –261/+52, –215/+52, –139/+52, –26/+52, and –261/–138) of the GalT I promoter region were prepared in a similar manner using sense primers containing XhoI restriction sites and the antisense primer that was used to generate the full-length GalT I reporter construct. Site-directed Mutagenesis—To prepare mutated promoters, the putative Ets transcription factor-binding site CTTCCC between nucleotide positions –205 and –200 was changed to CAACCC and named p-215M-luc. The mutation was created from p-215-luc by PCR using Takara MutanBEST mutagenesis kit. Mutated constructs were sequenced, and the correct ones were selected for further experiments. Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assay—72 h after transfection, cells were lysed with 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. Luminescence was measured over a 10-s interval on a plate luminometer and expressed in arbitrary units. β-Galactosidase was measured spectrophotometrically at 420 λ. The luciferase activity of each sample was normalized by β-galactosidase activity from the same sample and standardized. RCA-I Lectin Staining Procedures—To demonstrate binding reactions, the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) technique was employed according to Hsu et al. (28.Hsu S.M. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13474) Google Scholar). RCA-I staining procedures were as described previously (29.Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated on the dishes. To eliminate terminal sialic acid moieties, cells were digested with sialidase. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min. To minimize nonspecific binding reactions, specimens were covered for 15 min with 0.1% bovine calf serum and with a solution of avidin and then with a solution of biotin in PBS. Following this, cells were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 45 min in the presence of biotinylated lectins (10 μg/ml) in a humidified chamber. Subsequently, the samples were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated for 60 min with the ABC reagent and again washed in PBS. The peroxidase-binding sites were visualized by incubation with a fresh solution of 0.02% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% diaminobenzidine hydrochloride for 5 min. The cells were rinsed in tap water, followed by distilled water. Finally, the samples were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted. The mean density of RCA-I-positive labeling was from six different regions within the transfected PGLH7 cells and the controls. The values are expressed as the mean labeling density ± S.D. from three independent experiments using image cytometry. Invasion and Migration Analysis—Boyden chamber invasion assay was performed basically as described previously by Albini et al. (29.Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores were coated with 500 μg/ml of Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The coated filters were washed with serumfree medium and dried immediately. Then cells were added to the upper compartment of the chamber (1 × 105/100 μl of medium containing 0.1% BSA), and 800 μl of medium (containing 0.1% BSA) was added into the lower chamber. Cells were incubated and allowed to migrate for 24 h. After removal of nonmigrated cells, cells that had migrated through the filter were counted under a microscope in five fields at a magnification of ×400. Wound healing assays were performed as described (31.Hauck C.R. Hsia D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41092-41099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells in 6-well plates were serum-starved overnight. Over 20 wounds were made on the cell monolayer by scratching with a 200-μl sterile tip. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS. Complete growth media were then added to the plates, and cells were allowed to migrate for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. For cells migrating out of the agarose drop explants, 80% confluent cells were trypsinized and resuspended. 100 μl of agarose drop mixture was prepared (containing 1 × 106 cell suspension and a final concentration of 0.3% agarose). Each agarose drop explants contained 1.5 μl of mixture. On each of the following hours, the distance of the leading edge of migrated cells from the edge of the agarose droplet was determined on eight sides of each droplet, and five drops were used for each point. Gel Shift Assay—Gel mobility shift assay was carried out using Gel Shift Assay System (Promega) as follows. The double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-GCCCCGCCTTCCCGCCCTCGTCCAGAAAA-3′ and 3′-CGGGGCGGAAGGGCGGGAGCAGGTCTTTT-5′ (corresponding to human GalT I promoter sequence –212/–184) and Ets-1/E1AF consensus oligonucleotide 5′-GATCTCGAGCAGGAAGTTCGA-3′ and 3′-CTAGAGCTCGTCCTTCAAGCT-5′ were annealed, end-labeled with 32Pusing T4 polynucleotide kinase, and purified using Sephadex G-25 quick spin columns (Roche Applied Science). Nuclear proteins were preincubated for 10 min with 9 μl of electrophoretic mobility shift assay buffer. Then the 32P-end-labeled duplex oligonucleotide (1 μl, 10 fmol) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min on ice. For competition experiments, unlabeled DNA probes were included at 100-fold molar excess over the 32P-labeled DNA probe. For supershift experiments, 2 μg of rabbit anti-E1AF polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction mixtures and incubated for 30 min prior to addition of the 32P-labeled DNA probe. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA (pH 8.4) at 4 °C and 35 mA. The gels were dried, and the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Statistics and Presentation of Data—All experiments were repeated at least three times. All numerical data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed t test. Highly Metastatic PGBE1 Cells Have Higher GalT I mRNA Level Than Low Metastatic PGLH7 Cells—PGLH7 and PGBE1 cells, isolated from metastatic human lung giant cell carcinoma (PG), were two cell sublines with different spontaneous metastatic potentials. We analyzed the cell behavior of PGLH7 and PGBE1 cells in a wound healing test, agarose drop explants assay and Boyden chamber assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, PGBE1 cells readily migrate out of the agarose drop explants or into the wound in vitro (mechanical scratch made on the surface of growing cell culture) relative to PGLH7 cells. The difference in their invasive potentials was confirmed by Boyden chamber assay. PGBE1 cells showed higher ability to migrate through Matrigel-coated 8-μm pore-size membranes (Fig. 1B). We next analyzed GalT I mRNA expression in PGLH7 and PGBE1 cells by Northern blot analysis and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1C, GalT I mRNA expression was higher in highly metastatic lung cancer PGBE1 cells than in low metastatic PGLH7 cells. PGLH7 and PGBE1 Cells Have Similar Galactosylation Levels of Glycoproteins—To determine whether the levels of GalT I at the cell surface or global alteration in galactosylation of glycoprotein might be associated with metastatic potentials of PGLH7 and PGBE1 cells, we examined total galactosylated glycoprotein using RCA lectin blotting. Total cell lysates from PGLH7 and PGBE1 cells were separated by electrophoresis and labeled with biotinylated RCA lectin, which interacts specifically with oligosaccharides terminating with the Galβ1→4 GlcNAc group (32.Wu A.M. Sugu S. Gruezo F.G. Kabat E.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 178: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The results showed no significant differences in the galactosylation profiles of PGLH7 and PGBE1 cells (Fig. 2A), although the possibility exists"

Macrophages play an important role in the development and subsequent stability of atherosclerotic plaques. We reported previously that oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) induced macrophage proliferation through the secretion of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the consequent activation of p38 MAPK. The present study was designed to elucidate the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of statins on macrophage proliferation. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were used in our study. Cerivastatin and simvastatin each inhibited Ox-LDL-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into macrophages. Statins did not inhibit Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF production, but inhibited GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK activation. Farnesyl transferase inhibitor and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor inhibited GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation, and farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate prevented the effect of statins. GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was also inhibited by farnesyl transferase inhibitor or geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, and farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate prevented the suppression of GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation by statins. Furthermore, we found that statin significantly inhibited the membrane translocation of the small G protein family members Ras and Rho. GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK activation and macrophage proliferation was partially inhibited by overexpression of dominant negative Ras and completely by that of RhoA. In conclusion, statins inhibited GM-CSF-induced Ras- or RhoA-p38 MAPK signal cascades, thereby suppressing Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. The significant inhibition of macrophage proliferation by statins may also explain, at least in part, their anti-atherogenic action.

Immunohistochemical and pathological studies have established that the foam cells observed in the early phase of atherosclerotic lesions are derived from blood monocytes/macrophages (1Gordon D.

Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4600-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These cells, in turn, produce various bioactive molecules such as growth factors and cytokines that play an important role in the progression of early stage atherosclerotic process (4Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). Previous in vivo studies reported that macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells proliferated in atherosclerotic lesions (1Gordon D. Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4600-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 2Rosenfeld M.E. Ross R. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 680-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Spagnoli L.G. Orlandi A.

On the other hand, macrophages also play an important role in the development and subsequent stability of atherosclerotic plaques (5Moreno P.R. Falk E. Palacios I.F. Newell J.B. Fuster V. Fallon J.T. Circulation. 1994; 90: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). In this regard, Aikawa et al. (6Aikawa M. Rabkin E. Sugiyama S. Voglic S.J. Fukumoto Y. Furukawa Y. Shiomi M. Schoen F.J. Libby P. Circulation. 2001; 103: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) demonstrated the proliferation and activation of macrophages in the atherosclerotic plaque of Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. Therefore, the proliferation of macrophages may be involved in both the development of an early phase of atherosclerotic lesions and the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. We (7Sakai M.

Byrne R. Whitty G. Moss S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have shown that Ox-LDL enhances macrophage proliferation and survival in vitro. In addition, our previous study revealed that Ox-LDL could induce a rise in intracellular calcium concentration and the subsequent activation of protein kinase C in mouse peritoneal macrophages (8Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C activation mediates the production of granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which plays a priming role in the Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation (11Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)-dependent phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activation is involved, at least in part, downstream in the signaling pathway(s) after GM-CSF production (12Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) of p38 MAPK activation through the GM-CSF receptor is not clearly understood. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, commonly known as statins, are generally used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Their use is associated with significant reduction of adverse coronary events, including myocardial infarction and a marginal regression of plaque size (13Rabbani R. Topol E.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 402-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Libby P. Aikawa M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1257-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have suggested that the beneficial effects of statins may extend to mechanisms beyond cholesterol reduction (14Libby P. Aikawa M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1257-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 15Koh K.K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 16Takemoto M. Liao J.K. Arterioscler.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1832-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic effects of statins include the improvement or restoration of endothelial function, inhibition of the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, the reduction of vascular inflammation, and, importantly, the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques (15Koh K.K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 16Takemoto M. Liao J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). These pleiotropic effects of statins are based on blocking the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates, which serve as lipid attachments for a variety of intracellular signaling molecules, especially the Rho family small GTP-binding proteins, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation (15Koh K.K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 16Takemoto M. Liao J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Although our previous study revealed that statins suppressed Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation (19Sakai M. Kobori S. Matsumura T. Biwa T. Sato Y. Takemura T. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 133: 51-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the mechanism of the inhibitory action is not still fully understood. The purpose of the present study was to determine the mechanisms of the inhibitory effects of the statins cerivastatin and simvastatin on Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation and also to identify the molecular mechanisms of p38 MAPK activation during macrophage proliferation in the presence of Ox-LDL. Our results demonstrated that RhoA, a member of the small G protein super family, is involved in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation in the signaling pathway downstream of the GM-CSF receptor. Although statins did not inhibit Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF production, they inhibited RhoA-dependent p38 MAPK activation, thereby inhibiting macrophage proliferation. Materials—Simvastatin in lactone form was a generous gift from BANYU Pharmaceutical (Tokyo, Japan). Simvastatin in lactone form (94.2 mg) was dissolved in 1.8 ml of ethanol. The solution was added to 19 ml of 0.1 m NaOH and then incubated for 40 min at 40 °C to yield the active form, followed by the addition of 0.1 m HCl to adjust the pH to 7.4. Cerivastatin was a generous gift from Bayer Pharmaceutical (Osaka, Japan). Farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), and l-mevalonate were purchased from Sigma. FTI-276, GGTI-286, and Y-27632 were obtained from Calbiochem. Recombinant mouse GM-CSF was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). [3H]Thymidine (80 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho p38 MAPK, and the anti-p38 MAPK antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-pan Ras and the RhoA antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Other chemicals were of the best grade available from commercial sources. Lipoprotein Preparation—Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation from the plasma of normolipidemic subjects obtained with their consent and after overnight fasting (20Hakamata H. Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Suginohara Y. Sakamoto Y. Horiuchi S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LDL was dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Ox-LDL was prepared by incubation of LDL with 5 μm CuSO4 for 20 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 1 mm EDTA and cooling (21Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Sakamoto Y. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins was determined by a BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The endotoxin level of Ox-LDL was <1 pg/mg protein as measured by a commercially available kit (Toxicolor System, Seikagaku Corp.). We confirmed that the proliferation and viability of mouse resident macrophages was not affected by endotoxin at a concentration of <1 ng/ml under our experimental conditions. Cell Culture—The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Kumamoto University. Peritoneal macrophages were collected from anesthetized male C3H/He mice (25–30 g) by peritoneal lavage with 8 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) (medium A) (22Wong G.G.

Science. 1985; 228: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were incubated in appropriate tissue culture plates for 90 min with medium A. More than 98% of adherent cells were considered to be macrophages based on four criteria, as described previously (23Chodakewitz J.A. Kupper T.S. Coleman D.L. J.

Adenoviral Vectors—Mouse peritoneal macrophages were infected with a recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus containing each of the genes of dominant negative Ras (Asn17-H-Ras), dominant negative RhoA (Asn19-RhoA), and dominant negative p38 MAPK at a multiplicity of infection of ∼50, as described previously (25Deguchi J.

This condition conferred the expression of LacZ as a marker gene in nearly 100% of transfected cells (25Deguchi J. Makuuchi M. Nakaoka T. Collins T. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Tritiated Thymidine Incorporation and Cell-counting Assays— Macrophage monolayers (5 × 104 cells/well) were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates (15.5 mm in diameter, Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) in the presence of the indicated effectors for 6 days. For the thymidine incorporation assay, 18 h before the termination of the experiments 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each well and incubated. The tritiated thymidine incorporation assay was performed as described previously (11Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the cell-counting assay, macrophage monolayers (5 × 103 cells/well) were incubated in 96-well tissue culture plates with the indicated effectors. After incubation for 5 days, cells were lysed in 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and naphthol blue-black-stained nuclei were counted in a hemocytometer as described previously (11Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M.

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for GM-CSF—Macrophage monolayers (2 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plate; Nunc) were cultured in 2 ml of medium A with or without the indicated effectors. After incubation for 4 h, 300 μl of the medium were collected and immediately centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min to remove any particulate material. The concentration of the GM-CSF protein was determined as described previously (11Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR Analysis for GM-CSF mRNA—Macrophages (2 × 106 cells/well) were incubated with or without the indicated effectors. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA synthesis containing 1 μg of total RNA was primed with oligo(dT). To quantify GM-CSF transcripts, the LightCycler System (Roche Applied Science) was used (28Bendriss-Vermare N. Barthelemy C. Durand I. Bruand C. Dezutter-Dambuyant C. Moulian N. Berrih-Aknin S. Caux C. Trinchieri G. Briere F. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). PCRs were performed using SYBR Green I master mix and specific primers for mouse GM-CSF and mouse β-actin, which were designed as described previously (11Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A.

Quantitative results of GM-CSF mRNA were normalized for the levels of β-actin mRNA. To assess the specificity of the amplified PCR products, a melting curve analysis was performed after the last cycle. Western Blot Analysis—Macrophages (2 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plate; Nunc) were lysed by the lysis buffer and centrifuged (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min). Supernatants were used as sample proteins. Protein concentrations were determined by the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were applied to 10% SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by using semi-dry blotting. Membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000 for 2 h. After washing, the membranes were stained with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antigen detection was performed with an ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were quantified by the NIH Image analysis software. Membrane Fraction Extraction—Macrophages (2 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plate; Nunc) were suspended in 1 ml of sample preparation buffer (5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and sonicated for 30 s at 4 °C by Sonifier (Branson Sonic Power Co., Danbury CT). Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitates were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer and used as the membrane fractions. Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using the one-factor analysis of variance procedure. A p value of <0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. Effect of Statins on Ox-LDL-induced Proliferation and GM-CSF Production by Macrophages—Consistent with our previous report on simvastatin (19Sakai M. Kobori S. Matsumura T. Biwa T. Sato Y. Takemura T. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 133: 51-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), cerivastatin as well as simvastatin reduced Ox-LDL-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Cerivastatin was more potent than simvastatin in inhibiting Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation; the concentration of cerivastatin required for 50% inhibition was 5 nm with a maximum effect observed at 100 nm, whereas 100 nm and 1 μm were required, respectively, for simvastatin (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, cerivastatin or simvastatin alone had no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation up to a concentration of 10 μm. The cell-counting assay also showed that the Ox-LDL-induced increase in cell number was inhibited by 88 or 84% when cells were incubated with 100 nm cerivastatin or 10 μm simvastatin, respectively (Table I). In the presence of 100 nm cerivastatin or 10 μm simvastatin, >95% of the macrophages were viable as determined by both the cell-counting assay using the trypan blue staining and the release of lactic dehydrogenase from these cells (data not shown), indicating that statins at a dose of <10 μm are not cytotoxic to macrophages.Table IEffects of statins on Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation determined by cell counting assayCell number × 104 cells/wellPercentage of medium alone%Medium alone3.4 ± 0.3100Ox-LDL (20 μg/ml)7.6 ± 0.7224ap < 0.01, compared with medium alone.GM-CSF (15 pm)7.8 ± 0.6229ap < 0.01, compared with medium alone.Cerivastatin (100 nm)3.5 ± 0.4103Simvastatin (10 μm)3.4 ± 0.3100Ox-LDL + cerivastatin3.9 ± 0.4115bp < 0.01, compared with cells incubated with Ox-LDL alone.GM-CSF + cerivastatin4.0 ± 0.4118cp < 0.01, compared with cells incubated with GM-CSF alone.Ox-LDL + simvastatin4.1 ± 0.3121bp < 0.01, compared with cells incubated with Ox-LDL alone.GM-CSF + simvastatin4.3 ± 0.5126cp < 0.01, compared with cells incubated with GM-CSF alone.a p < 0.01, compared with medium alone.b p < 0.01, compared with cells incubated with Ox-LDL alone.c p < 0.01, compared with cells incubated with GM-CSF alone. Open table in a new tab Because we focused on the role of GM-CSF in the Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation (11Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of cerivastatin on Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF production. Our results showed that GM-CSF production was not affected by pre-treatment with statins both at mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein levels (Fig. 1C). Cerivastatin or simvastatin alone had no effect on the expression of GM-CSF mRNA and protein under these conditions (data not shown). Effect of Statins on GM-CSF-induced Macrophage Proliferation—GM-CSF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation was also reduced by both simvastatin and cerivastatin in a dose-dependent manner. Cerivastatin showed stronger effect than simvastatin, and their IC50 values were 80 and 700 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, cerivastatin and simvastatin alone had no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation at concentrations up to 10 μm. Concordant with the result of a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, the GM-CSF-induced increase in cell number was significantly inhibited by 80 and 86.4%, respectively, when macrophages were incubated with either cerivastatin or simvastatin (Table I). Furthermore, these statins had no effect when used alone (Table I). Roles of Isoprenoids in GM-CSF-induced Macrophage Proliferation and Inhibition by Statins—To clarify the roles of metabolites of the mevalonate pathway on GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation, we examined the effect of mevalonate and its metabolites. As shown in Fig. 2B, cerivastatin- or simvastatin-mediated inhibition of GM-CSF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation was completely prevented by co-incubation with mevalonate, whereas squalene failed to reverse the effect of statins. Cerivastatin- or simvastatin-mediated inhibition of GM-CSF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation was completely prevented by co-incubation with GGPP and partially by FPP. On the other hand, the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-276 inhibited GM-CSF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation by 46.5%. The geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-286 also inhibited GM-CSF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation by 77.5%, which was similar to the inhibitory effect of statins. Effect of Statins on GM-CSF-induced MAPK Activation in Macrophages—We reported previously the involvement of p38 MAPK activation in GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation (12Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of statins on GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Simvastatin, cerivastatin, and isoprenyl transferase inhibitors (FTI and GGTI) had no effect on GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and C) but significantly decreased GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and D). To determine whether statin-induced inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation was mediated by metabolites of the mevalonate pathway, we examined the restorative effect of isoprenyl pyrophosphates on the suppression of p38 MAPK phosphorylation by simvastatin. As shown in Fig. 3E, simvastatin-mediated reduction of p38 MAPK phosphorylation induced by GM-CSF was significantly rescued by co-incubation with FPP or GGPP. Effect of Statins on Membrane Localization of Ras and RhoA—To determine whether statins regulate the activity of small G proteins, which are upstream components of MAPK cascades, in macrophages, we next examined the membrane localization of Ras and RhoA. Stimulation with GM-CSF (15 pm) increased the level of membrane-bound Ras (Fig. 4A) and RhoA (Fig. 4B), and simvastatin significantly prevented GM-CSF-induced Ras and RhoA membrane localization without affecting the total amount of these proteins in macrophages (Fig. 4, A and B). The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on Ras membrane localization was completely reversed by FPP and partially reversed by GGPP (Fig. 4A). In contrast, co-treatment with GGPP completely reversed the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on RhoA membrane localization, whereas FPP only partially reversed the effect (Fig. 4A). Involvement of Small G Proteins in GM-CSF-induced Macrophage Proliferation through the Activation of p38 MAPK—We next performed a series of experiments to clarify whether the small G proteins mediate the activation of MAPKs in the signaling pathways of macrophage proliferation induced by GM-CSF. For this purpose, we introduced adenoviruses that expressed dominant negative forms of Ras and Rho. GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased in the cells infected with the dominant negative form of Rho, but it was significantly decreased in the cells infected with the dominant negative form of Ras (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was significantly decreased in the cells infected with the dominant negative form of Ras or Rho, with a much stronger effect of dominant negative Rho (Fig. 4D). An adenoviral control vector had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation or p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, pre-treatment with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 significantly inhibited GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation at concentrations ≥10 μm (Fig. 4E). On the other hand, infection with dominant negative Ras and Rho partially but significantly inhibited GM-CSF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into macrophages by 21.1 and 55.5%, respectively (Fig. 5). GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation was also partially but significantly inhibited by pretreatment with 10 and 100 μm of Y-27632 by 59.2 and 62.8%, respectively (Fig. 5). In addition, infection with the dominant negative form of p38 MAPK also inhibited GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation by 57.4% (Fig. 5). Macrophage proliferation in atherosclerotic lesions has been demonstrated by several groups (1Gordon D. Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4600-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 2Rosenfeld M.E. Ross R. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 680-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Spagnoli L.G. Orlandi A. Santeusanio G. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 88: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the proliferation was also reported to be reduced by statin treatment (6Aikawa M. Rabkin E. Sugiyama S. Voglic S.J. Fukumoto Y. Furukawa Y. Shiomi M. Schoen F.J. Libby P. Circulation. 2001; 103: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Regarding the effect of statins, we demonstrated in a previous study that Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation was inhibited by simvastatin and pravastatin (19Sakai M. Kobori S. Matsumura T. Biwa T. Sato Y. Takemura T. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 133: 51-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further demonstrated the impacts of Ras and Rho on Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation and provided evidence that statins inhibit the proliferation by suppressing p38 MAPK through the inhibition of Ras and Rho in the signaling pathways downstream of the GM-CSF receptor without affecting GM-CSF production. Based on our previous studies, Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF production is mainly involved in macrophage proliferation (11Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms of Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation can be divided into two parts: (i) intracellular signaling pathway before GM-CSF release; and (ii) proliferation signaling pathway through the GM-CSF receptor. Moreover, we reported that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK play pivotal roles in each stage of signaling pathways (12Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, although cerivastatin as well as simvastatin inhibited the Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation, these two statins had no effect on GM-CSF production either at mRNA or protein levels. On the other hand, these statins showed significant inhibition on recombinant GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation and macrophage proliferation. Therefore, statins inhibited macrophage proliferation by altering the signals from the GM-CSF receptor to p38 MAPK. We demonstrated in the present study that the inhibitory effect of statins on Ox-LDL- or GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation was prevented completely by mevalonate, but not by squalene. In addition, we found that GGTI showed a more potent inhibitory effect than did FTI on Ox-LDL- or GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation. Moreover, statin-mediated decrease in Ox-LDL- or GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation was reversed completely by GGPP and partially by FPP, and these phenomena were also observed in GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK activation. These results suggest that the geranylgeranylation of protein(s) plays a major role in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation, and the growth inhibitory effects of statins mainly depend on the suppression of protein geranylgeranylation. Several isoprenylated proteins have been reported to be potential targets for statin-induced inhibition of atherogenic activities in vascular cells (16Takemoto M. Liao J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 30Liao J.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although several reports focused on the role of Ras in mediating cell proliferation (31Irani K. Herzlinger S. Finkel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a number of recent reports demonstrated that a proper processing of not only Ras but also Rho (34Guijarro C. Blanco-Colio L.M.

Circulation. 2002; 105: 1756-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) or Rac (38Wassmann S. Laufs U. Baumer A.T. Muller K. Konkol C. Sauer H. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Mol Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) proteins by mevalonate-derived products served as a crucial step in atherogenic changes in vascular cells, suggesting that the suppression of cellular activity by statins is mediated through inhibition of Rho or Rac function. Especially regarding macrophage proliferation, Aikawa et al. (6Aikawa M. Rabkin E. Sugiyama S. Voglic S.J. Fukumoto Y. Furukawa Y. Shiomi M. Schoen F.J. Libby P. Circulation. 2001; 103: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) demonstrated that macrophage colony stimulating factor-induced cell proliferation was suppressed by cerivastatin in human monocyte-derived macrophages and that the inhibition was reversed by mevalonate, FPP, and GGPP, suggesting that inhibition of protein farnesylation or geranylgeranylation by cerivastatin was a critical point in the statin-mediated inhibition of macrophage proliferation. However, the distinct roles of farnesylated or geranylgeranylated proteins in macrophage proliferation have not been fully clarified. In our series of experiments on the overexpression of dominant negative forms of the small G proteins Ras and RhoA, GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation and macrophage proliferation was inhibited by dominant negative RhoA and, to a lesser extent, by dominant negative Ras. In addition, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 inhibited GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation and macrophage proliferation in a way similar to the effect of the overexpression of dominant negative RhoA. These results suggest that GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation is mainly mediated by signals through RhoA. The activation of ERK is widely known to be mediated through the Ras-Raf-MEK cascade (39Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). In the present study, it was of note that simvastatin completely inhibited GM-CSF-induced membrane translocation of Ras but had only a small effect on the phosphorylation of ERK. These results suggest that, in macrophages, GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 activation is mediated through signaling pathways other than that of Ras-Raf-MEK. It is generally accepted that the targets of protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation are members of Ras and Rho protein family, respectively. However, the effect of simvastatin on Ras membrane translocation was reversed by co-incubation with not only FPP but also with GGPP, although the latter effect was partial. This is possibly explained by an alternative modification of small G proteins. Indeed, K-Ras is normally farnesylated, but it can be alternatively geranylgeranylated in the absence of FPP (40James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Similarly, RhoB can be either geranylgeranylated or farnesylated by geranylgeranyl transferase I (41Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 42Armstrong S.A. Hannah V.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7864-7868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that Ras, which is usually modified by FPP, was prenylated by GGPP under our experimental conditions. However, our data also indicated that the farnesyl transferase inhibitor and dominant negative Ras still suppressed p38 MAPK phosphorylation and macrophage proliferation. These results suggest that even it is only partial, Ras mediates the GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which results in macrophage proliferation. Recent studies reported that small G-protein Rho and its effector, Rho kinase/ROK/ROCK, is involved in accelerating the atherosclerotic process. Indeed, Miyata et al. reported the involvement of Rho kinase in the macrophage-mediated formation of coronary vascular lesions, coronary constrictive remodeling, and vasospastic responses in the in vivo porcine model (43Miyata K. Shimokawa H. Kandabashi T. Higo T. Morishige K. Eto Y. Egashira K. Kaibuchi K. Takeshita A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 44Morishige K. Shimokawa H. Eto Y. Kandabashi T. Miyata K. Matsumoto Y. Hoshijima M. Kaibuchi K. Takeshita A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mallat et al. (45Mallat Z. Gojova A. Sauzeau V. Brun V. Silvestre J.S. Esposito B. Merval R. Groux H. Loirand G. Tedgui A. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) reported that the inhibition of Rho kinase significantly limited early atherosclerotic plaque development in the LDL receptor knock-out mice. These studies identified Rho kinase inhibitors as potential candidates for the treatment of atherosclerosis. We demonstrated in the present study that statins also have an inhibitory effect on Ox-LDL-induced RhoA activation in macrophages. Therefore, statin may act as an inhibitor of the Rho-dependent signaling pathway, thereby preventing the acceleration of atherosclerosis. Recently, Schaefer et al. reported that statins also prevented Ox-LDL-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation by suppressing the mevalonate pathway independent of the regulation of reactive oxygen species or nitric oxide (46Schaefer C.A. Kuhlmann C.R. Gast C. Weiterer S. Li F. Most A.K. Neumann T. Backenkohler U. Tillmanns H. Waldecker B. Wiecha J. Erdogan A. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2004; 41: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition of the small G protein-p38 MAPK pathway by statins, which we proposed in the present study, may be involved in the suppression of endothelial cell proliferation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated in the present study the role of small G proteins in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation and identified the mechanisms of statin-mediated inhibition of Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. RhoA plays a pivotal role in p38 MAPK activation and macrophage proliferation, whereas Ras has only a partial effect, and statins inhibit macrophage proliferation by suppressing both Ras and RhoA activation, which mainly mediates GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (summarized in Fig. 6). This action may contribute to the beneficial effect of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2033798316,"The conversion of peptides and proteins into highly ordered and intractable aggregates is associated with a range of debilitating human diseases and represents a widespread problem in biotechnology. Protein engineering studies carried out in vitro have shown that mutations promote aggregation when they either destabilize the native state of a globular protein or accelerate the conversion of unfolded or partially folded conformations into oligomeric structures. We have extended such studies to investigate protein aggregation in vivo where a number of additional factors able to modify dramatically the aggregation behavior of proteins are present. We have expressed, in Escherichia coli cells, an E. coli protein domain, HypF-N. The results for a range of mutational variants indicate that although mutants with a conformational stability similar to that of the wild-type protein are soluble in the E. coli cytosol, variants with single point mutations predicted to destabilize the protein invariably aggregate after expression. We show, however, that aggregation of destabilized variants can be prevented by incorporating multiple mutations designed to reduce the intrinsic propensity of the polypeptide chain to aggregate; in the cases discussed here, this is achieved by an increase in the net charge of the protein. These results suggest that the principles being established to rationalize aggregation behavior in vitro have general validity for situations in vivo where aggregation has both biotechnological and medical relevance.

The conversion of peptides and proteins into highly insoluble fibrillar aggregates is associated with at least 25 well characterized human disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and various systemic amyloidoses (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 2Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Recently, many natural proteins that have no known links to human disease have been found to be able to form aggregates similar to the fibrils associated with clinical amyloid diseases (2Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 3Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3815) Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal that both the amino acid sequences of proteins and the components of the cellular machinery dedicated to “housekeeping” functions have evolved to prevent uncontrolled protein aggregation (3Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3815) Google Scholar, 4Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). In addition to its significance in cell biology and medicine, protein aggregation is a fundamental problem in biotechnology. For example, the heterologous expression of proteins in bacteria, the de novo design of novel proteins or the rational modification of existing proteins, is frequently frustrated by the fact that the polypeptide chains aggregate into large assemblies, including inclusion bodies or amyloid fibrils (5West M.W.

It is generally accepted that in most cases aggregates such as amyloid fibrils originate from ensembles of partially unfolded conformations rather than from the folded and functional states of proteins (Fig. 1) (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 3Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3815) Google Scholar, 8Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Consistent with this idea, amino acid substitutions can promote amyloid formation in vitro when they destabilize the native state of a protein (10Hurle M.R. Helms L.R. Li L. Chan W. Wetzel R. Proc.

More recently, it has also been shown from in vitro experiments that mutations can favor amyloid formation when they facilitate the subsequent step in the aggregation process of globular proteins (or the primary step for natively unfolded proteins or for unstructured peptides), i.e. the conversion of unfolded or partially folded states into oligomeric species (19Otzen D.E.

Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Aggregation in such cases has been found to be facilitated by mutations that either increase the hydrophobicity of the polypeptide chain or its propensity to convert from α-helical to β-sheet structure or decrease the overall net charge on the protein molecule (19Otzen D.E.

Although the ability to induce amyloid formation in vitro under controlled conditions has greatly facilitated the identification of the underlying physicochemical characteristics that govern protein aggregation, the importance of such determinants in the highly complex and crowded intracellular or extracellular environments in vivo has not yet been established. Indeed, many aspects of the environment in a living organism can potentially alter dramatically the aggregation behavior of peptides and proteins. These include the effects of macromolecular crowding (27Minton A.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R97-R99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the presence of partner proteins or small ligands binding preferentially to the native state of a protein (28Klabunde T.

In addition, ongoing translation provides in vivo a continuous supply of unfolded or partially folded protein that facilitates substantially aggregation of the soluble pool that has already attained the native state (34Klein J. Dhurjati P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A complete understanding of protein aggregation in living organisms therefore requires our current knowledge of the chemistry and physics of protein aggregation to be linked specifically with the manifestations of such phenomena in human pathologies and biotechnological systems. In the present study we have expressed, in Escherichia coli cells, the N-terminal domain of the E. coli protein HypF (HypF-N). HypF-N has been found to be able to convert in vitro, under appropriate conditions, into fibrils that are morphologically and tinctorially indistinguishable from those associated with disease (35Chiti F. Bucciantini M. Capanni C. Taddei N. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Relini A. Torrassa S. Rolandi R. Gliozzi A. Rosano C. Canale C. Bolognesi M. Plakoutsi G. Bucciantini M. Chiti F. Stefani M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fibril formation process of HypF-N consists of a number of steps during which pre-fibrillar aggregates precede formation of structured fibrillar species (4Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar, 36Relini A. Torrassa S. Rolandi R. Gliozzi A.

In this paper we describe how the expression of a range of mutants of this protein in the cytosol of E. coli cells has provided us with an opportunity to explore the aggregation of a protein within the living organism in which it is naturally expressed. Analysis of a range of mutations and a comparison with a structurally homologous protein with very different aggregation behavior in vitro have enabled us to show that a number of important principles that we and others have put forward from experiments in vitro are also of general validity in vivo. Protein Expression and Purification—Protein expression was performed using the glutathione S-transferase (GST) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; AcP, human muscle acylphosphatase; ThT, thioflavin T. fusion system. Cultures of E. coli XL-1 Blue cells harboring the pGEX-2T/HypF-N plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin with vigorous shaking. These were then diluted (1:10) in fresh LB medium and grown until the A600 reached ∼1.0 under the same conditions. Protein expression was induced for 2 h at 37 °C using 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cell lysis and protein purification by affinity chromatography (glutathione-agarose, Sigma) was performed as described previously (37Modesti A. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Colombini B. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). HypF-N cleaved from GST was directly eluted from the column after overnight incubation with bovine thrombin (50 units, Sigma). Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the final protein concentration was determined by UV absorption measurements (ϵ280 = 1.22 ml mg-1 cm-1). Mutated genes of HypF-N were obtained using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The presence of the desired mutation was assessed by sequencing the entire gene. All mutational variants were expressed in E. coli XL-1 Blue cells and purified similarly to the wild-type protein. The Protein Data Bank code 1GXT was used for the design of the mutations. Cloning and Expression of Isolated HypF-N Variants—The genes of wild-type, F22A, L58A, and L84A HypF-N were cloned in the pET-11a plasmid (Novagen, EMD Biosciences Inc., Madison, WI). E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with the recombinant vectors and grown with vigorous shaking at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until they reached an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm. 3-ml aliquots of the cultures were diluted in 100 ml of fresh LB medium and grown for an additional 4 h under the same conditions of shaking and temperature. No induction was performed in order to maintain low levels of protein expression. SDS-PAGE—Cell growth and protein expression for XL-1 Blue cells expressing each variant fused to GST, and for BL21 cells expressing some of the variants in their isolated forms, were carried out as described above. Cells were harvested by centrifugation of 40 ml of bacterial growths, resuspended in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed using 1 mg ml-1 hen lysozyme (Sigma) and 5 cycles of sonication for 30 s. 1.5 ml were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet fraction was resuspended in 1.5 ml of 1% SDS and boiled for 10 min. Aliquots of 100 μl of both the supernatant and the solubilized pellet were mixed with 50 μl of 3× sample buffer, and the volume resulting from the following formula was applied to the gel: 270 μl/(concentration factor × A600 at the end of protein expression), where the concentration factor indicates how many times the cells increase in concentration after harvesting (10 in our experiments). A 15% SDS-PAGE was performed at 200 V and 25 mA per gel. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (0.1% Coomassie Blue, 10% acetic acid, 40% methanol). Western Blotting—Proteins separated using SDS-PAGE were transferred from the gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) for 1 h at 400 mA and 25 V using a miniVE Blot Module (Hoefer). Immunochemical detection of the HypF-N-GST fusion protein was achieved by incubation with serum collected from rabbits immunized with purified HypF-N (antibody production was carried out by Primm s.r.l., Milan, Italy). The serum was diluted (1:1000) in TBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 5% nonfat dried milk (bovine), 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with immunoblots. After washing (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS buffer) the membranes were incubated with secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (both from Amersham Biosciences). Urea Unfolding at Equilibrium—For each purified protein variant, the intrinsic fluorescence of 25–30 pre-equilibrated samples containing 0.02 mg ml-1 protein in varying concentrations of urea was measured. All experiments were carried out in 50 mm acetic acid, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 5.5, 28 °C. Measurements were made on an LS 55 spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 335 nm, respectively. For each protein variant, the dependence of intrinsic fluorescence on denaturant concentration was analyzed as described by Santoro and Bolen (38Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar) to yield the free energy change of the unfolding reaction in water (ΔGU-FH2O), the dependence of ΔG on denaturant concentration (m value), and the midpoint of denaturation (Cm). Thioflavin T (ThT) Fluorescence—Wild-type and mutated HypF-N were incubated at a concentration of 0.4 mg ml-1 in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 30% (v/v) trifluoroethanol, 25 °C, at urea concentrations ranging from 0 to 3 m. After 30 min, 60 μl of each protein sample were mixed with 440 μl of 25 μm ThT, 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The resulting fluorescence was measured using the LS 55 fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 440 and 485 nm, respectively. Many Mutants of HypF-N Aggregate after in Vivo Expression—Wild-type HypF-N and 18 mutational variants having single amino acid substitutions were expressed in E. coli cell cultures (Table I). Three groups of variants can be identified from this set: (i) 8 mutants in which an alanine residue replaces a buried hydrophobic residue; (ii) 7 mutants in which an alanine or a glycine residue replaces a proline residue; and (iii) 3 mutants in which a positively charged amino acid replaces a hydrophilic or a negatively charged amino acid exposed to the solvent (Table I). To facilitate purification of the proteins from E. coli cell lysates, all variants were initially expressed as fusion proteins in which the N-terminal residue of HypF-N follows the C-terminal residue of GST. Purification of 12 of the HypF-N mutants failed after expression in E. coli cells (indicated in Table I with a minus or plus/minus sign). By contrast, wild-type HypF-N and six mutants (indicated in Table I with a plus sign) could be purified with reasonable yields (∼2 mg per liter of growth medium).Table IConformational stabilities of wild-type HypF-N and 18 mutational variants having single amino acid substitutionsMutantSolubilityaPlus, minus, and plus/minus signs indicate HypF-N variants that are fully soluble, fully aggregated, and partially aggregated after expression in vivo, respectively.

Fig. 2 shows the Western blots obtained from the SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the bacterial clones expressing the hydrophobic core mutants (the corresponding gels run in parallel without Western blotting are reported in the supplemental Fig. 5). A large band corresponding to the molecular weight of the GST-HypF-N fusion protein (37 kDa) was detected by HypF-N-directed antibodies in the soluble fraction of the E. coli cells producing the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). This indicates that wild-type HypF-N remains, to a considerable extent, soluble after expression. For some variants carrying mutations within the hydrophobic core, an intense band corresponding to the fusion protein can be observed only in the pellet lanes (Fig. 2). These mutants (F22A, L29A, L33A, L58A, and F88A) appear to aggregate completely after expression in vivo. For other mutants (V26A, I80A, and L84A), the GST-HypF-N fusion band was clearly visible in both the soluble and insoluble fractions, indicating that significant quantities of these expressed proteins aggregated after expression, whereas another fraction remained soluble. The latter mutants could not be purified because the pool remaining in solution after expression aggregated rapidly during the purification procedure. It was shown that the soluble pool of a protein that initially partitioned between an aggregated and a soluble state continued to migrate to the insoluble form (34Klein J. Dhurjati P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of attempts to purify the aggregating variants from inclusion bodies using suitable protocols were performed. All of them failed because of the inexorable aggregation of the mutated proteins during the purification procedure after their solubilization from the inclusion bodies (see supplemental Fig. 6). Overall, this analysis shows three different typologies of behavior of the HypF-N variants: fully soluble (indicated with a plus sign in Table I), partially aggregated (indicated with a plus/minus sign in Table I), and fully aggregated (indicated with a minus sign in Table I) after expression. The difficulty in purifying many of the HypF-N variants arises from the high propensities of the variants involved to aggregate after expression. HypF-N Mutants Aggregating in Vivo Are Less Stable Than Soluble Variants—The HypF-N variants that could be purified in reasonable yields, including the wild-type protein, were characterized in further detail. The conformational stabilities, after cleavage from the GST protein, were measured by acquiring urea titration curves at equilibrium, using fluorescence spectroscopy to detect the conformational changes of the proteins accompanying denaturation (Fig. 3). A single sharp transition was observed for all variants, and urea denaturation curves were analyzed using a two-state model (38Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The values of the free energy change of the unfolding transition (ΔGU-FH2O) for all the variants analyzed are listed in Table I. The wild-type protein was found to have a conformational stability of 29 ± 3 kJ mol-1. Most interestingly, all the purified variants have stabilities similar to the wild-type protein, with none displaying a ΔGU-FH2O value lower than 25 ± 3 kJ mol-1 (Table I). The conformational stabilities of the variants that could not be purified because of their aggregation behavior were estimated using Fold-X, an algorithm based on an empirical formula derived from the experimentally determined ΔGU-FH2O values of over 1000 single mutants from different proteins (40Guerois R. Nielsen J.E. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Fold-X has been shown to predict the change in the conformational stability of a protein as a result of specific mutations (ΔΔGU-FH2O) within a standard deviation (σ) of 3.4 kJ mol-1 and an error (2σ) of 6.8 kJ mol-1 from the real value (40Guerois R. Nielsen J.E. Serra"
https://openalex.org/W2071706387,"Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) is a widely expressed serine/threonine kinase implicated in cell death and smooth muscle contractility, but its mechanism of regulation is unknown. We have identified six phosphorylation sites in ZIPK that regulate both its enzyme activity and localization, including Thr180, Thr225, Thr265, Thr299, Thr306, and Ser311. Mutational analysis showed that phosphorylation of Thr180 in the kinase activation T-loop, Thr225 in the substrate-binding groove, and Thr265 in kinase subdomain X is essential for full ZIPK autophosphorylation and activity toward exogenous substrates. Abrogation of phosphorylation of Thr299, Thr306, and Ser311 had little effect on enzyme activity, but mutation of Thr299 and Thr300 to alanine resulted in redistribution of ZIPK from the cytosol to the nucleus. Mutation of Thr299 alone to alanine caused ZIPK to assume a diffuse cellular localization, whereas T299D redistributed the enzyme to the cytoplasm. C-terminal truncations of ZIPK at amino acid 273 or 342 or mutation of the leucine zipper motif increased ZIPK activity toward exogenous substrates by severalfold, suggesting a phosphorylation-independent autoinhibitory role for the C-terminal domain. Additionally, mutation of the leucine zipper reduced the ability of ZIPK to oligomerize and also caused ZIPK to relocalize from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in vivo. Together, our findings show that ZIPK is positively regulated by phosphorylation within its kinase domain and that it contains an inhibitory C-terminal domain that controls enzyme activity, localization, and oligomerization.

Res. 2004; 95: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and cell death processes (5Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Kawai T. Akira S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6174-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ZIPK is a member of a larger family of protein kinases known as the death-associated protein kinases, which include DAPK, DRP-1 (DAPK-related protein-1), DRAK1, and DRAK2 (7Cohen O. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ZIPK itself is composed of an N-terminal protein kinase domain and a C-terminal domain that contains a leucine zipper motif. ZIPK shares 80% identity within its kinase domain with DAPK, but shows no homology in its C-terminal domain to other DAPK family members and, in contrast to DAPK, does not contain a death or calmodulin-binding domain, and its activity is regulated independently of calcium (8Shohat G. Shani G. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Like other members of the DAPK family, ZIPK causes cell death upon overexpression in a variety of cell types, suggesting that the enzyme may play a role in apoptosis (5Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Kawai T. Akira S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6174-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 9Kogel D. Plottner O. Landsberg G. Christian S. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells that overexpress ZIPK typically show signs of rounding, membrane blebbing, DNA fragmentation, and detachment from the matrix. However, it remains unclear what the mechanism of cell death is since some indicators of apoptosis, such as caspase-3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, are not associated with ZIPK overexpression (10Shani G. Marash L. Gozuacik D. Bialik S. Teitelbaum L. Shohat G. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8611-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It has been argued that cell death induced by ZIPK and other DAPK family members may be a result of autophagy as opposed to apoptosis (10Shani G. Marash L. Gozuacik D. Bialik S. Teitelbaum L. Shohat G. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8611-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Some insight into the phenotype caused by the overexpression of ZIPK may be gained from studying its candidate substrate proteins. Like other members of the DAPK family, ZIPK is capable of phosphorylating smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin light chains (1Komatsu S. Ikebe M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Indeed, phosphorylation of myosin light chain is known to cause reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and this could explain, at least in part, some of the cellular phenotypes observed with ZIPK overexpression such as membrane blebbing and cell rounding (13Murata-Hori M. Fukuta Y. Ueda K. Iwasaki T. Hosoya H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8175-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Bialik S. Bresnick A.R. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ZIPK has also been implicated in smooth muscle contraction and relaxation. Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by the phosphorylation state of myosin light chain, which is regulated, in part, by the myosin light chain phosphatase SMPP-1M (15Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37211-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). SMPP-1M is a phosphoprotein, and phosphorylation of at least two sites (Thr696 and Ser850) within its 110–130-kDa regulatory subunit, MYPT1 (myosin phosphatase targeting subunit-1), inhibits phosphatase activity (2MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 16Lontay B. Serfozo Z. Gergely P.

Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). MYPT1 is phosphorylated and inhibited during calcium sensitization, a process in which muscle contraction occurs at constant concentrations of calcium (20Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). To better understand how SMPP-1M is regulated, a proteomics approach was performed to identify protein kinases in smooth muscle capable of phosphorylating MYPT1. A protein kinase that associated with and phosphorylated Thr696 of MYPT1 was identified as a fragment of ZIPK (2MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that ZIPK is the major MYPT1-associated kinase in smooth muscle aortic cells (4Karim S.M. Rhee A.Y. Given A.M. Faulx M.D. Hoit B.D. Brozovich F.V. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other targets for ZIPK in smooth muscle that may contribute to the Ca2+-sensitizing effects of the enzyme, including the SMPP-1M inhibitor protein CPI-17 (21MacDonald J.A. Eto M. Borman M.A. Brautigan D.L. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and myosin light chain itself (1Komatsu S. Ikebe M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), have also been identified. Direct evidence in support of a role for ZIPK in Ca2+ sensitization has come from experiments showing that addition of the purified recombinant enzyme to Triton X-100-skinned muscle fibers causes profound contraction at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations (3Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of ZIPK regulation is unknown, evidence suggests that ZIPK is regulated by phosphorylation in vivo. First, ZIPK phosphorylation and activity are increased in smooth muscle in response to carbachol (2MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Second, treatment of ZIPK with protein phosphatase inactivates the enzyme (12Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Third, ZIPK can be phosphorylated by DAPK in vitro, and this phosphorylation was reported to control the localization of ZIPK and to affect its ability to induce cell death (10Shani G. Marash L. Gozuacik D. Bialik S. Teitelbaum L. Shohat G. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8611-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, ZIPK autophosphorylates in vitro (2MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation sites and their functional significance have not been determined. We have undertaken a comprehensive study to identify ZIPK phosphorylation sites in vitro and in vivo and to determine their physiological relevance. We defined six sites of phosphorylation within ZIPK that regulate both its activity and localization within cells. We show that three sites in the conserved kinase domain (Thr180, Thr225, and Thr265) are essential for kinase activation, whereas phosphorylation of three sites in the C-terminal domain (Thr299, Thr306, and Ser311) has little effect on enzyme activity toward exogenous substrates. However, phosphorylation of ZIPK at Thr299 regulates the intracellular location of ZIPK. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ZIPK is highly regulated by multisite phosphorylation, and since five of the identified phosphorylation sites in ZIPK are conserved in other DAPK family members, our findings may have implications for the regulation of these highly related enzymes. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP was obtained from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). ANTI-FLAG® M2 monoclonal antibody, 3X FLAG® peptide, and ANTI-FLAG® M2 antibody affinity gel were obtained from Sigma. Sequencing grade modified porcine trypsin (V5111) was from Promega, and chymotrypsin was obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-ZIPK antibodies directed against amino acids 279–298 were from Calbiochem, and anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10-agarose and anti-c-Myc (A-14) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Plasmid Construction—For 3X FLAG-ZIPK, full-length human ZIPK was amplified by PCR using the following primers (which contain HindIII and BamHI sites, respectively): forward primer, AGTCAAGCTTTCCACGTTCAGGCAGGAGGAC; and reverse primer, CAGTGGATCCCTAGCGCAGCCCGCACTCCAC. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites in the p3XFLAG-CMV-10 expression vector (Sigma). This vector encodes three adjacent FLAG epitopes with the N-terminal sequence MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK preceding ZIPK. For Myc-ZIPK, full-length human ZIPK was amplified by PCR using the following primers (which contain XhoI and BamHI sites, respectively) to incorporate a Myc tag: forward primer, TGCACTCGAGATGGCAGAACAGAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTGTCCACGTTCAGGCAGGAGGAC; and reverse primer, CAGTGGATCCCTAGCGCAGCCCGCACTCCAC. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). This strategy encodes a Myc tag with the N-terminal sequence MAEQKLISEEDL preceding ZIPK. Site-directed Mutagenesis—All ZIPK mutants were created with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and completely sequenced for confirmation. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Expression and Purification of ZIPK—HeLa and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Transfections were performed using Superfect (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For expression of ZIPK, four 100-cm dishes of HEK293 cells were transfected with ZIPK DNA and incubated for 48 h. Cells were harvested and homogenized in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml Pefabloc. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was mixed with ANTI-FLAG® M2 antibody affinity gel for 1 h at 4 °C. The ANTI-FLAG® M2 antibody affinity gel was then washed four times with cell lysis buffer and two times with Tris-buffered saline before elution of ZIPK with 150 μm 3X FLAG® peptide in Tris-buffered saline. In Vivo Labeling with [32P]Orthophosphate—HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) or kinase-inactive (D161A) ZIPK for 48 h, washed three times with phosphate-free medium (phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum), and incubated in phosphate-free medium for an additional 2 h. Cells were then incubated in phosphate-free medium containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. 32P-Labeled ZIPK was isolated from cells as described above. Protein Kinase Assays and Determination of Phosphorylation Stoichiometry—Purified ZIPK from HEK293 cells was assayed for kinase activity in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of ∼7500 cpm/pmol), and 0.5 mg/ml myosin phosphatase regulatory subunit peptide (M110 peptide) or myosin light chain peptide. Kinase reactions were initiated by addition of ZIPK and terminated after 10 min by addition of 20 μl of 20 mm H3PO4. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (20 μl) were spotted onto P-81 papers, which were washed three times with 20 mm H3PO4 before measuring 32P incorporation by Cerenkov radiation. For ATP preincubation studies, ZIPK was incubated for the indicated times (minutes) at 4 °C in kinase reaction buffer with or without 100 μm ATP. Following preincubation, the ATP concentration for all samples was adjusted to 100 μm with [γ-32P]ATP (∼7500 cpm/pmol), and kinase assays were performed for 30 s using myosin light chain peptide as substrate. To measure the stoichiometry of ZIPK autophosphorylation, 1 μg of purified WT ZIPK was incubated in kinase reaction buffer with 2.5 mm ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 394,800 cpm/nmol) for 10 min at 37 °C before addition of 1 mg of bovine serum albumin and 100 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. Following incubation on ice for 10 min, the precipitant was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g and washed three times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid before 32P incorporation was measured by Cerenkov radiation. Autophosphorylation, HPLC, Edman Degradation, and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—For autophosphorylation, purified ZIPK was incubated in kinase reaction buffer as described above with 50 μm ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (>100,000 cpm/nmol) for 30 min at 30 °C. Autophosphorylated ZIPK was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, visualized by silver staining, and in gel-digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin (1.5 μg) overnight at 37 °C. The protein digests were acidified by addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a reverse-phase C18 column (30 × 0.1 cm) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0–60% in 60 min) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected, and phosphopeptides were detected by Cerenkov radiation. Selected phosphopeptides were immobilized on Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and subjected to sequential Edman degradation with a vapor-phase amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems Procise 494). Phosphorylation sites were assigned with the aid of the CRP (cleaved radioactive analysis of phosphopeptides) program (available at fasta. bioch.virginia.edu/crp/). Selected phosphopeptides were also subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. To this end, specific HPLC fractions were incubated with 5.3 m HCl at 100 °C for 1 h, followed by evaporation of the acid. Phosphoamino acids were spotted onto thin-layer cellulose plates (Fisher), and electrophoresis was carried out in one dimension for 60 min at 1000 V in buffer containing 5.9% acetic acid, 0.8% formic acid, and 0.3% pyridine at pH 2.5. Phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by spraying with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone, and 32P was detected by autoradiography. Mass Spectrometry—Purified ZIPK from transfected HEK293 cells was in gel-digested with trypsin (0.6 μg), and the tryptic peptides were subjected to nanospray electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) on an Applied Biosystems QSTAR® pulsar mass spectrometer. In some cases, ZIPK tryptic peptides were first resolved by HPLC, and individual fractions were subjected to analysis by ESI-MS. Positive mode time of flight was used to identify ZIPK peptides, and individual peptides were sequenced by ESI-MS/MS using BioAnalyst software. ZIPK Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—FLAG-ZIPK or Myc-ZIPK was transfected in HEK293 cells, and lysates were prepared as described above. FLAG-ZIPK or Myc-ZIPK was immunoprecipitated with FLAG-agarose or Myc-agarose, respectively, and washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific proteins were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with ANTI-FLAG® M2 monoclonal antibody (1:10,000) or anti-c-Myc antibody (1:1000), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells (104) were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes (Fisher) for 24 h and then transfected using Superfect and allowed to grow for an additional 24 h. Coverslips were removed and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), and cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and blocked with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min. After blocking, cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-FLAG antibody diluted 1:1000 in the blocking solution or with anti-c-Myc antibody (1:1000) and then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min. Cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted 1:200 in the blocking solution for 1 h and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole at 0.1 μg/ml in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Following washing four times with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using mounting medium (ProLong antifade kit, Molecular Probes, Inc.) and sealed with nail polish. Cells were imaged with a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. Cell Adherence Assays—HEK293 cells were seeded in 100-cm dishes in triplicate and transfected 24 h later with a combination of ZIPK DNA (14 μg) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) DNA (2 μg). At 24 h after transfection, the medium was harvested, and the unattached cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed once with PBS and then suspended in cell lysis buffer as described above. Following clarification by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, cell lysates were measured for GFP fluorescence using a POLARstar Galaxy fluorescence plate reader (BMG LABTECH GmbH). Cell lysates prepared from the non-adherent cells were also subjected to immunoblotting for FLAG-ZIPK with anti-FLAG antibody. Identification of ZIPK Autophosphorylation Sites—It was shown previously that ZIPK undergoes autophosphorylation; but the sites of phosphorylation were not identified, and their function was not addressed (5Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to identify all ZIPK phosphorylation sites in the full-length enzyme and to determine their significance. To this end, we transiently expressed full-length FLAG-tagged ZIPK in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated the enzyme with anti-FLAG antibody, and eluted it with a FLAG peptide to obtain a highly pure enzyme preparation (>90% as judged by silver staining) (Fig. 1A). If incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in vitro, purified ZIPK was found to readily autophosphorylate at serine and threonine residues (Fig. 1A). Autophosphorylation activity was abolished following mutation of Asp161 to Ala (Fig. 1A). Asp161 is part of the highly conserved DFG sequence that comprises the so-called “T-loop” of subdomain VII found in all protein kinases, and loss of this residue is likely to cause disruption of catalytic activity because of the involvement of the DFG sequence in the coordination of Mg2+ with the α- and β-phosphates of ATP (22Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). In vivo labeling of ZIPK with [32P]orthophosphate showed that WT ZIPK underwent autophosphorylation in intact cells, and expression of the D161A mutant of ZIPK indicated that the majority of ZIPK phosphorylation under basal conditions was due to ZIPK autophosphorylation (Fig. 1A). To identify both the in vitro autophosphorylation and in vivo phosphorylation sites in ZIPK, the in vitro autophosphorylated enzyme and the enzyme isolated from 32P-labeled HEK293 cells were digested with trypsin. The phosphotryptic peptides were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC and collected, and the radioactivity was measured. Four distinct peaks of radioactivity were recovered from the tryptic cleavage of both the in vitro autophosphorylated and in vivo phosphorylated enzymes (Fig. 1, B and D, respectively), suggesting that the same sites are labeled in both proteins. The major difference between the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylated enzymes was the presence of an additional peak (fraction 27) present only in the in vitro phosphorylated enzyme (Fig. 1B). Phosphoamino acid analysis of fraction 27 revealed the presence of phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine, and Edman degradation and 32P cycle release determined that the tyrosine phosphorylation occurred within the FLAG peptide sequence (data not shown). In agreement with this result, phosphoamino acid analysis of Myc-tagged ZIPK (which does not contain tyrosine in its epitope) did not reveal any phosphotyrosine (data not shown). To identify the phosphorylation sites in ZIPK, the phosphopeptides generated from the tryptic cleavage of ZIPK were cross-linked to Immobilon-P, and any radioactivity released after each round of Edman cycling was measured. As shown in Fig. 1G, the majority of the radioactivity was detected in cycles 3 and 5, with some radioactivity also detected in cycle 4 of fractions 23 and 32. Using the CRP algorithm (23MacDonald J.A. Mackey A.J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 314-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Mackey A.J. Haystead T.A. Pearson W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3859-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we identified all possible serine and threonine residues that are 3, 4, or 5 amino acids away from an arginine or lysine (the cleavage site for trypsin). This analysis identified 15 potential phosphorylation sites at Ser51, Ser52, Ser57, Thr112, Thr180, Thr225, Thr227, Thr265, Ser288, Thr306, Ser311, Ser312, Ser371, Ser373, and Ser429. To further narrow down the candidate phosphorylation sites, phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on the phosphotryptic peptides (Fig. 1C). Phosphotryptic fraction 30 contained a cycle 3 and 5 release, and phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that only phosphothreonine was present (Fig. 1, G and C, respectively). This analysis eliminated Ser373 as a potential phosphorylation site and identified Thr180 or Thr227 as a phosphorylation site. To further narrow down the number of phosphorylation sites, autophosphorylated ZIPK was digested with chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptides were resolved by HPLC (Fig. 1E). In this case, four major peaks of radioactivity were identified, and Edman analysis of HPLC fractions 5, 22, 29, and 32 detected radioactivity at cycles 2, 1, 6, and 8, respectively (Fig. 1, E and H). Phosphoamino acid analysis of chymotryptic fraction 5 indicated that it contained only phosphothreonine (Fig. 1F) and generated a cycle 2 release, unambiguously identifying Thr180 as a ZIPK phosphorylation site (Fig. 1H). Although we could not unequivocally identify other phosphorylation sites from the chymotryptic digest of ZIPK, an Edman cycle release at positions 1, 6, and 8 is consistent with phosphorylation of Thr306, Ser311, and Thr225, respectively (Fig. 1H). To further narrow down the number of possible ZIPK phosphorylation sites, Ser-to-Ala and Thr-to-Ala point mutations were introduced at the putative phosphorylation sites. All of the ZIPK mutants ge"

Both mutants showed defects in protein degradation in vivo. However, the affinity-purified 26 S proteasome of the rpn6 mutants grown at the permissive temperature degraded polyubiquitinated Sic1p efficiently, even at a higher temperature. Interestingly, their enzyme activity was even higher at a higher temperature, indicating that once made mutant proteasomes are stable and have little defect in the proteolytic function. These results suggest that the deficiency in protein degradation observed in vivo is rather due to a defect in the assembly of a holoenzyme at the restrictive temperature. Indeed, both rpn6 mutants grown at the restrictive temperature were defective in assembling the 26 S proteasome. A striking feature of the rpn6 mutants at the restrictive temperature was that there appeared a protein complex composed of only four of the nine lid components, Rpn5p, Rpn8p, Rpn9p, and Rpn11p. Altogether, we conclude that Rpn6p is essential for the integrity/assembly of the lid in the sense that it is necessary for the incorporation of Rpn3p, Rpn7p, Rpn12p, and Sem1p (Rpn15p) into the lid, thereby playing an essential role in the proper function of the 26 S proteasome.

The 26 S proteasome is a multicatalytic protein complex that is highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is essential for eliminating damaged or misfolded proteins and for degrading short lived regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, signal transduction, apoptosis, and metabolic regulation (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6915) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Substrate proteins must be polyubiquitinated by E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CP, core particle; DSP, dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate]; GAD, GAL4 activation domain; GBD, GAL4 binding domain; ORF, open reading frame; PCI, proteasome/COP9/initiation factor; RP, regulatory particle; Rpn, regulatory particle non-ATPase; Rpt, regulatory particle triple A ATPase; Ub, ubiquitin(s); SC, synthetic complete./E2/E3 enzymes prior to recognition and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (reviewed in Ref. 1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6915) Google Scholar). Ubiquitins (Ub) are linked to each other through isopeptidyl bonds at their 48th lysine (Lys48), and this polyubiquitin chain is recognized by the proteasome, and the substrate protein is degraded in an ATP-dependent manner. The 26 S proteasome consists of two complexes, the 20 S core particle (CP) and the 19 S regulatory particle (RP). It has the RP attached either on one end (RP1CP) or on both ends of the CP (RP2CP). The CP is composed of a stack of two α rings and two β rings in the order of α, β, β, α, each of which consists of seven related components (3Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). The proteolytic active sites are sequestered in the inner cavity of the CP (4Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Crystallographic study revealed that the gate of the CP allows the entry of substrate proteins only upon binding with the RP (5Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Upon high salt treatment, the RP can be divided further into two subunits, the base and the lid. The base consists of six AAA-ATPase subunits (Rpt1p-Rpt6p) and two non-ATPase subunits (Rpn1p and Rpn2p), whereas the lid is made of eight non-ATPase subunits (Rpn3p, Rpn5p–Rpn9p, Rpn11p, and Rpn12p) (6Glickman M.H.

Additional proteasome-associated proteins have also been identified and characterized (7Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Recently, Sem1p (Rpn15p), a homologue of human Dss1p, was shown to be the ninth component of the lid (9Sone T. Saeki Y. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28807-28816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and Rpn13p was shown to be an additional base component (7Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 28807-28816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A non-ATPase subunit, Rpn10p, was found to associate with the base or the lid, depending on the purification method (6Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To further understand the biochemical processes conducted by the 19 S RP, it is important to know what role the individual components of the RP are playing. The ATPases in the base are required for the unfolding of substrate proteins before their translocation into the CP cavity (12Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and some other components have been studied in detail. Of the RP components, Rpn10p and Rpt5p have been suggested to be responsible for the recognition of substrate through the attached poly-Ub chain (13Deveraux Q. Jensen C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Rpn11p metalloisopeptidase, a lid component, was shown to play an essential role in cleaving off the Ub chain from polyubiquitinated substrate proteins (21Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H.

However, whereas functional characterization of the RP has considerably progressed, the mechanism of its assembly remains to be elucidated. To date, interactions among RP components were studied using yeast two-hybrid analysis (11Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 28Cagney G. Uetz P. Fields S. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 7: 27-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Rpn10p was shown to strengthen the binding between the lid and the base (6Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). We have shown in a previous report that Rpn7p is indispensable for the incorporation of Rpn3p and Rpn12p into the lid (29Isono E. Saeki Y. Yokosawa H. Toh-e A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Obviously, more information concerning the individual components of the lid would be necessary for further understanding of the assembling process of the 26 S proteasome. In this study, we focused on Rpn6p and carried out a detailed analysis of temperature-sensitive rpn6 mutants. Until now, the function of Rpn6p has only been analyzed by depletion mutants in yeast (26Santamaria P.G. Finley D. Ballesta J.P. Remacha M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6687-6695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in Drosophila (30Lier S. Paululat A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 298: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These works suggested that Rpn6p was necessary for the proper assembly and activity of the 26 S holoenzyme (26Santamaria P.G. Finley D. Ballesta J.P. Remacha M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6687-6695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and that it plays a role in development (30Lier S. Paululat A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 298: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The data presented below show that Rpn6p is indeed essential for the structural integrity of the 26 S holoenzyme, especially for the proper construction of the lid, by incorporating four other components, Rpn3p, Rpn7p, Rpn12p, and Sem1p (Rpn15p), into the lid.

Temperature-sensitive rpn6 mutants were screened as follows (33Tohe A. Oguchi T. Genes Genet. Syst. 2000; 75: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). First, a BamHI integration site was introduced into the RPN6 ORF. PCR was conducted with two pairs of primers, Rpn6-Mut1 (SalI) 5′-GGAAGTCGACGAAATTAGAAGAGGCCAGG-3′ and Rpn6-Mut2 (BamHI) 5′-GGAAGGATCCAAGGAGTCCGGCAC-3′, and Rpn6-Mut3 (BamHI) 5′-GGAAGGATCCCAGATCTTTGTGTGCG-3′ and Rpn6-Mut4 (NotI) 5′-GGAAGCGGCCGCACCTCTACAAAATCC-3′, using the genomic DNA of W303–1B as a template. The resulting PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted between the SalI and NotI sites of YIp vector pRS306 by three-fragment ligation to yield pNS102 harboring 5′-truncated RPN6 (nucleotides +18 to +659) with a BamHI site created near the 5′-terminal region. PCR mutagenesis was performed according to the method described previously (34Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a pair of primers, Rpn6-Mut1 and Rpn6-Mut4, and pNS102 as a template. The mutagenized PCR products were cloned into pRS306 (URA3) to yield a mutant library. The library DNA was digested at the BamHI site, introduced into W303-1B cells to replace the RPN6 gene with the mutated rpn6 gene. Ura+ transformants exhibiting temperature sensitivity of growth were collected as mutant candidates. The mutant candidates were crossed with the wild-type W303-1A, and the linkage between a putative mutant gene causing temperature-sensitive growth and the auxotrophic marker (URA3) was confirmed by tetrad analysis. DNA Manipulation—DNA engineering and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed as described elsewhere (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain terminating method (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using an automated DNA sequencer, ABI 310 (Applied Biosystems). Protein Extraction, SDS-PAGE, Nondenaturing PAGE, and Western Blotting—Yeast total proteins were extracted as follows. Cells were grown to late log phase, harvested by centrifugation, and broken with 0.5-mm glass beads in cold Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease complete inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) using a multibead shocker (MB501; Yasui Kikai). ATP and MgCl2 were added at the final concentrations of 2 and 10 mm, respectively, and a 1× ATP regeneration system was added to the extract for gel filtration chromatography and affinity purification. SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and Western blotting were performed according to the standard protocol. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified proteasomes were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE (6Glickman M.H.

Anti-AtRpn6p antibody (Arabidopsis thaliana; Affiniti Research) was used successfully to detect Rpn6p in purified proteasomes but not in crude lysates. β-Galactosidase Assay—Cells carrying plasmids encoding Ub-Ala-β-galactosidase, Ub-Pro-β-galactosidase, or Ub-Arg-β-galactosidase were grown in 10 ml of SR-U medium to midlogarithmic phase at 30 °C and then supplemented with a final concentration of 2% galactose after 2 h of incubation and incubated for a further 5 h at either 25 or 37 °C. Cells were harvested and subjected to a β-galactosidase assay using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as a substrate following the protocol described elsewhere (42Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 169-171Google Scholar). Protein quantification was performed as described above. Gel Filtration—Yeast total lysates were prepared as described above, and 2 mg of total proteins were run on a Superose 6 column (1.0 × 30 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (21Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected every 2 min (500 μl/tube). Peptidase activity of relevant fractions without the addition of SDS were measured as described previously (29Isono E. Saeki Y. Yokosawa H. Toh-e A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Peptidase activity was measured also with final concentration of 0.02% SDS in the reaction mixture to activate the 20 S CP. Proteasomal components in the fractions were detected by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. Affinity Purification of Proteasomes—Wild-type and mutant strains whose Rpn11p was tagged with 3×FLAG were constructed as described previously (43Saeki Y. Saitoh A. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A single colony from each strain was inoculated in 250 ml of YPDAU liquid medium and cultured overnight to yield 2–3 mg (wet weight) of cells. Cells were suspended in 5 ml of Buffer A′ (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1× ATP regeneration system) and broken using the multibead shocker (MB501; Yasui Kikai). After centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C (CR22G; Hitachi), lysates were filtrated through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore Corp.) and mixed with 150 μl of anti-FLAG antibody-immobilized M2 beads. The mixture was rotated for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed extensively with Buffer A, and the proteasomes were eluted with 150 μl of 0.2 mg/ml 3×FLAG peptides (Sigma). The method for affinity purification of the wild-type lid was described previously (29Isono E. Saeki Y. Yokosawa H. Toh-e A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels were photographed using an image analyzer (LAS-3000; Fujifilm), and protein bands were quantified with the Image Gauge (Fujifilm) software. In Vitro Degradation Assay—An in vitro degradation assay was performed using ubiquitinated Sic1PYp as a substrate. Details of this method will be published elsewhere. 3Y. Saeki, E. Isono, and A. Toh-e, manuscript in preparation. In short, a PY motif, a target sequence of the E3 Rsp5p, was introduced into the N-terminal region of Sic1p (designated Sic1PYp), and the SIC1PY gene was cloned into a pET vector (Novagen). The resulting plasmid was transformed to E. coli, and Sic1PYp was expressed and purified as described previously (21Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Purified Sic1PYp was then incubated with Uba1p, Ubc4p, and Rsp5p, allowing polyubiquitination of Sic1PYp. A 300 nm concentration of thus produced polyubiquitinated Sic1PYp was mixed with 100 nm purified proteasomes and incubated in the existence of 1 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2 for the indicated time at the indicated temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of the SDS-PAGE-loading buffer, and the mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-T7 antibody to detect the degree of degradation. Two-hybrid Analysis—Plasmids for two-hybrid analysis were constructed as follows. The EcoRI-SalI fragment of ScRpn6-GADCT harboring the RPN6 ORF without the stop codon was subcloned into the EcoRI-SalI site of pBluescript KS (–) (Stratagene) to yield pEK229. Using this plasmid as a template, mutations were introduced by PCR using a QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primer pairs EK97 FLf 5′-GAGAAAAAAGGGTGCTTTTGAAGCATTCAC-3′ and EK98 FLr 5′-GTGAATGCTTCAAAAGCACCCTTTTTTCTC-3′, and EK99 LPf 5′-AAGTTGAAGGAAAGCCCTCCCAAATGATAC-3′ and EK100 LPr 5′-GTATCATTTGGGAGGGCTTTCCTTCAACTT-3′. The EcoRI-SalI fragments of the resulting plasmids were then subcloned into GADCT to yield pEK236 and pEK237, respectively. The ORF of rpn6-1 was amplified using primers EK106 (EcoRI) 5′-AAGGGAATTCATGTCTCTGCCAGGTTCGAA-3′ and EK171 rpn6-1 (SalI) 5′-AAGGGTCGACTTTAGGAATTCTTACTCTGG-3′ and cloned into the EcoRI-SalI site of pGADCT to yield pEK238. Plasmids were transformed into YRG-2 cells (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and transformants were tested for growth on SC-LWH plates, which were missing leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Construction of an rpn6 Mutant Containing either F137L or L377P Amino Acid Substitution—PCRs were performed using primer pairs (a) Rpn6-Mut1 (SalI) and EK98 FLr, (b) EK97 FLf and Rpn6-Mut4 (NotI), (c) Rpn6-Mut1 (SalI) and EK100 LPr, and (d) EK99 LPf and Rpn6-Mut4 (NotI) using pNS102 as a template. PCR products by primer pairs a and b were mixed and used as a template for the second PCR with primers Rpn6-Mut1 (SalI) and Rpn6-Mut4 (NotI). The resulting products were cloned into the SalI-NotI site of pRS306 to yield pEK183FL. PCR products by primer pairs c and d were processed similarly to yield pEK183LP. These plasmids were digested at the BamHI site and introduced into W303–1B cells to yield strains YEK122 and YEK123, respectively. The T1394C and T2130C mutations in the integrants were verified by DNA sequencing. In Vivo Cross-linking—Cells were grown to reach midlog phase and washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 m phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and then suspended in 5 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline. 20 mm stock solution of DSP (Pierce) dissolved in dry Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 2 mm and left 30 min at a room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 150 mm and incubating for 15 min at a room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with Buffer A and subjected to affinity purification of proteasomes. Samples were boiled in 5% 2-mercaptoethanol containing SDS-loading buffer to break the disulfide bond in DSP prior to SDS-PAGE. Two Temperature-sensitive Mutants of RPN6 Were Isolated—To investigate the function of Rpn6p, we carried out a PCR mutagenesis-"
https://openalex.org/W1990180328,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the main constituents of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane. It usually consists of a highly variable O-antigen, a less variable core oligosaccharide, and a highly conserved lipid moiety, designated lipid A. Several bacteria are capable of modifying their lipid A architecture in response to external stimuli. The outer membrane-localized lipid A 3-O-deacylase, encoded by the pagL gene of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, removes the fatty acyl chain from the 3 position of lipid A. Although a similar activity was reported in some other Gram-negative bacteria, the corresponding genes could not be identified. Here, we describe the presence of pagL homologs in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. Although the overall sequence similarity is rather low, a conserved domain could be distinguished in the C-terminal region. The activity of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bordetella bronchiseptica pagL homologs was confirmed upon expression in Escherichia coli, which resulted in the removal of an R-3-hydroxymyristoyl group from lipid A. Upon deacylation by PagL, E. coli lipid A underwent another modification, which was the result of the activity of the endogenous palmitoyl transferase PagP. Furthermore, we identified a conserved histidine-serine couple as active site residues, suggesting a catalytic mechanism similar to serine hydrolases. The biological function of PagL remains unclear. However, because PagL homologs were found in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic species, PagL-mediated deacylation of lipid A probably does not have a dedicated role in pathogenicity.

Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar). It consists of three covalently linked domains: lipid A, the core, and the O-antigen. Lipid A forms the hydrophobic membrane anchor and is responsible for the endotoxic activity of LPS. In Escherichia coli, it consists of a 1,4′-bisphosphorylated β-1,6-linked glucosamine disaccharide, which is replaced by R-3-hydroxymyristic acid residues at positions 2, 3, 2′, and 3′ via ester or amide linkage. Secondary lauroyl and myristoyl groups replace the hydroxyl group of R-3-hydroxymyristoyl at the 2′ and 3′ positions, respectively (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have shown that the phosphate groups, the glucosamine disaccharide, and the correct number and length of the acyl chains are important for the biological activity of lipid A (1Raetz C.R.H.

Additional modifications of lipid A (Fig. 1B) are regulated in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) by the two-component regulatory system PhoP/PhoQ (6Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S.

In response to low Mg2+ levels, the sensor kinase PhoQ phosphorylates and thereby activates the transcriptional activator PhoP, which leads to the activation or repression of 40 different genes (6Guo L.

A second regulatory system involved in lipid A modification is the PmrA/PmrB two-component system, which itself is PhoP/PhoQ-regulated (9Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M.

Mutants with alterations in the PhoP/PhoQ system exhibit reduced virulence and an increased susceptibility to anti-microbial peptides (11Miller S.I. Kukral A.M. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Substitution of the 1- and 4′-phosphate groups with one or two 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) moieties in S. Typhimurium was found to be dependent on the enzyme ArnT (15Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A.

One of them is the palmitoyl transferase PagP (19Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5071-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of lipid A leads to an increased resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (7Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2098-2106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contain 3-O-deacylated lipid A species, suggesting that these organisms contain enzymes with an activity similar to that of PagL. We report now the identification of PagL homologs in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. The limited sequence similarity among the various proteins was used to identify active site residues.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—All bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table I. Unless otherwise notified, the . coli and P. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37 °C and 30 °C, respectively, in a modified Luria-Bertani broth, designated LB (26Tommassen J. van Tol H. Lugtenberg B. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.2% glucose, or in minimal medium (SV) (49Winkler K.C. de Haan P.G. Arch. Biochem. 1948; 18: 97-107PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% glucose, while shaking at 200 rpm. To induce expression of the pagL genes cloned behind the T7 promoter, the bacteria were grown in LB supplemented with glucose until an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of 0.4–0.6 was reached. Expression of the pagL genes was then induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and incubation at 37 °C was continued. When appropriate, bacteria were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline, or 100 μg/ml streptomycin, for plasmid maintenance. S. Typhimurium SR11 was grown on LB agar plates at 37 °C. B. bronchiseptica and B. pertussis strains were grown at 35 °C on Borduet-Gengou agar (Difco) supplemented with 15% defibrinated sheep blood (Biotrading). Stain JG101, carrying a tetracycline-resistance transposon insertion in pagP, was obtained by P1 transduction by using E. coli BL21 Star™ (DE3) and E. coli SK2257 (Table I) as the acceptor and donor, respectively.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidGenotype or descriptionSource or referenceStrainsB. bronchisepticaB505Wild-type strainN.V.I.aNetherlands Vaccine Institute, Bilthoven, The NetherlandsB. pertussisBP509Dutch vaccine strainN.V.I.aNetherlands Vaccine Institute, Bilthoven, The NetherlandsBP134Dutch vaccine strainN.V.I.aNetherlands Vaccine Institute, Bilthoven, The NetherlandsP. aeruginosaPAO1Wild-type strain45Jacobs M.A. Alwood A.

Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Promega Wizard® Plus SV minipreparations system. Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase and restriction endonucleases were used according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Fermentas). DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the Qiagen quick gel extraction kit. Ligations were performed by using the rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science).The pagL genes from S. Typhimurium SR11 (pagL(St)), B. bronchiseptica B505 (pagL(Bb)), and P. aeruginosa PAO25 (pagL(Pa)) were cloned into pET-11a (Novagen) behind the T7 promoter. The genes were amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA as template. Template DNA was prepared by resuspending ∼109 bacteria in 50 μl of distilled water, after which the suspension was heated for 15 min at 95 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged for 1 min at 16,100 × g, after which the supernatant was used as template DNA. The sequences of the forward primers, which contained an NdeI site (underlined), including an ATG start codon, were 5′-AACATATGAAGAGAATATTTATATATC-3′ (pagL(St)), 5′-AACATATGAAGAAACTACTTCCGCTGG-3′ (pag-L(Pa)), and 5′-AACATATGCAATTTCTCAAGAAAAACA-3′ (pagL(Bb)). The sequences of the reverse primers, which contained a BamHI site (underlined) and included a stop codon, were 5′-AAGGATCCTCAGAAATTATAACTAATT-3′ (pagL(St)), 5′-AAGGATCCCTAGATCGGGATCTTGTAG-3′ (pagL(Pa)), and 5′-AAGGATCCTCAGAACTGGTACGTATA-G-3′ (pagL(Bb)). The PCRs were done under the following conditions: 50-μl total reaction volume, 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 3 μl of template DNA solution, 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1.75 units of Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix with buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). The temperature program was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, a cycle of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 72 °C repeated 30 times, followed by 10 min at 72 °C and subsequent cooling to 4 °C. The PCR products were purified from agarose gel and subsequently cloned into pCRII-TOPO. Plasmid DNA from correct clones was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the PagL-encoding fragments were ligated into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET-11a. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli DH5α using the CaCl2 method (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA from transformants was checked for presence of the correct PagL-encoding insert by digestion with NdeI and BamHI. Plasmids that gave a correct digestion profile were designated pPagL(Pa), pPagL(Bb), and pPagL(St) (Table I). The correct coding sequences of the cloned pagL genes were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing in both directions. Mutations were introduced in pagL by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the primers listed in Table II. Plasmid pPagL(Pa) was used as the template in which the mutations were created. The presence of the correct mutations was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing in both directions.Table IIPrimers used for site-directed mutagenesisNameaThe primer name gives the amino acid substitution, e.g. H81A_FW indicates that the oligonucleotide shown was used as the forward primer in a site-directed mutagenesis procedure to replace the histidine at position 81 of the precursor PagL(Pa) with an alanineSequence (5′-3′)bIntroduced mutations are underlinedH81A_FWGAAGGCGCCGGCAAGGCGTCGCTGTCGTTCGCTH81A_REVAGCGAACGACAGCGACGCCTTGCCGGCGCCTTCH81N_FWGAAGGCGCCGGCAAGAACTCGCTGTCGTTCGCTH81N_REVAGCGAACGACAGCGAGTTCTTGCCGGCGCCTTCS84A_FWGGCAAGCATTCGCTGGCGTTCGCTCCGGTATTCS84A_REVGAATACCGGAGCGAACGCCAGCGAATGCTTGCCS84C_FWGGCAAGCATTCGCTGTGCTTCGCTCCGGTATTCS84C_REVGAATACCGGAGCGAAGCACAGCGAATGCTTGCCH149A_FWGGCGTTCGGGCGATCGCGTATTCCAACGCCGGCH149A_REVGCCGGCGTTGGAATACGCGATCGCCCGAACGCCH149N_FWGGCGTTCGGGCGATCAACTATTCCAACGCCGGCH149N_REVGCCGGCGTTGGAATAGTTGATCGCCCGAACGCCS151A_FWCGGGCGATCCACTATGCGAACGCCGGCCTGAAAS151A_REVTTTCAGGCCGGCGTTCGCATAGTGGATCGCCCGS151C_FWCGGGCGATCCACTATTGCAACGCCGGCCTGAAAS151C_REVTTTCAGGCCGGCGTTGCAATAGTGGATCGCCCGa The primer name gives the amino acid substitution, e.g. H81A_FW indicates that the oligonucleotide shown was used as the forward primer in a site-directed mutagenesis procedure to replace the histidine at position 81 of the precursor PagL(Pa) with an alanineb Introduced mutations are underlined Open table in a new tab Isolation of Cell Envelopes—Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,500 × g and washed once in 50 ml of cold 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The cell pellets were frozen for at least 15 min at -80 °C and then suspended in 20 ml of 3 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were disrupted by sonication, after which unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,500 × g. The cell envelopes were pelleted from the supernatant by centrifugation for 1.5 h at 150,000 × g and resuspended in 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The cell envelopes were stored at -80 °C in aliquots.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) with 0.2% SDS in the running gel using the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN®3 apparatus. Samples were applied to a 13% polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 150 V. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Prestained or unstained Precision Plus Protein™ Standard from Bio-Rad was used to determine the relative molecular mass. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.6), 0.5% nonfat dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with guinea pig antibodies directed against PagL(Pa) in blocking buffer followed by an incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG antibodies (Sigma) in blocking buffer. Blots were developed using SuperSignal® WestPico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).Polyclonal Antibodies—For antibody production, the pagL gene from P. aeruginosa PAO25 without the signal sequence-encoding part was PCR amplified by using the forward primer (5′-AACATATGGCGGACGTCTCGGCCGCCG-3′), which contained an NdeI site (underlined), including an ATG start codon, and the reverse primer (5′-AAGGATCCCTAGATCGGGATCTTGTAG-3′), which contained an BamHI site (underlined) and included a stop codon. The PCR product was cloned into pET-11a, and the resulting plasmid, pPagL(Pa)(-), was used to transform E. coli BL21 Star™ (DE3) to allow for expression of the truncated pagL gene. The PagL(Pa) protein, accumulating in inclusion bodies, was isolated (29Dekker N. Merck K. Tommassen J. Verheij H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), purified from a preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and used for immunization of guinea pigs at Eurogentec.Microsequencing—Proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gels to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) in 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 10% methanol (v/v) at 100 V for 1 h using the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN®2 blotting apparatus. After transfer, the membrane was washed three times for 15 min with distilled water. Transferred proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The membrane was dried in the air, and the putative PagL bands were excised and subjected to microsequencing at the Sequencing Center Facility, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.LPS Analysis by Tricine-SDS-PAGE—Approximately 109 bacteria were suspended in 50 μl of sample buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar), and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (end concentration) was added. The samples were incubated for 60 min at 55 °C followed by 10 min at 95 °C to inactivate proteinase K. The samples were then diluted 10-fold by adding sample buffer, after which 2 μl of each sample was applied to a Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel (30Lesse A.J. Campagnari A.A. Bittner W.E. Apicella M.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 126: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The bromphenol blue was allowed to run into the separating gel at 35 V, after which the voltage was increased to 105 V. After the front reached the bottom of the gel, the samples were left running for another 45 min. The gels were fixed overnight in water/ethanol/acetic acid 11:8:1 (v/v/v) and subsequently stained with silver as described previously (31Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar).Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI/MS)—LPS was isolated using the hot phenol/water extraction method (32Westphal O. Jann J.K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar). For fatty acid analysis by GC/MS, a 5-fold volume excess of acetone was added to an aliquot of the isolated LPS (0.2 mg/ml), after which the solution was dried at 60 °C under a nitrogen flow. Subsequently, 10 μg of C12:0(2OH) (1 mg/ml in ethanol) was added as an internal standard, as well as 100 μl of acetylchloride/ethanol 1:9 (v/v), after which the samples were derivatized for 1 h at 90 °C. After cooling, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of 1 m K2HPO4 (pH 8.0), followed by extraction of the acylethyl esters with 200 μl of ethyl acetate. A 1-μl volume of the upper phase was used for analysis by GC/MS on a Finnigan MAT SSQ in the electron-impact mode. For ESI/MS, an aliquot of isolated LPS was freeze-dried and taken up in 1.8 ml of 12.5 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) containing 1% SDS. The mixture was boiled for 30 min to hydrolyze the LPS and release the lipid A moiety, after which the mixture was cooled to room temperature and converted into a two-phase Bligh and Dyer mixture by adding 2 ml of methanol and 2 ml of chloroform. Phases were separated by centrifugation, after which the lower phase was collected and washed twice with the upper phase of a fresh two-phase Bligh and Dyer mixture, consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (2:2: 1.8, v/v). Structural analysis of purified lipid A was performed by nanoelectrospray tandem MS on a Finnigan LCQ in the positive ion mode (33Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of PagL Homologs in various Gram-negative Bacteria—The 187-amino acid sequence of the S. Typhimurium PagL precursor protein (GenBank accession no. AAL21147) was used as a lead to identify putative PagL homologs in other Gram-negative bacteria, by searching all completed and unfinished genomes of Gram-negative bacteria present in the NCBI data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi). BLAST search (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of putative homologs in the Bordetella spp. B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica, and B. parapertussis (Fig. 2). The PagL homologs of B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis are two mutually identical 178-amino acid polypeptides (Fig. 2) with, as predicted by the SignalP server (35Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), a 25-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide. A gene for a PagL homolog was also found in the genome of the B. pertussis Tohama I strain (36Parkhill J. Sebaihia M. Preston A. Murphy L.D. Thomson N. Harris D.E. Holden M.T. Churcher C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2148541235,"We have previously described regulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by its amino-terminal FERM-like domain through an autoinhibitory interaction with its kinase domain (Cooper, L. A., Shen, T. L., and Guan, J. L. (2003) Mol. Cell. Biol. 23, 8030–8041). Here we show that the first two subdomains of the FERM-like domain are independently capable of inhibiting phosphorylation of FAK in trans. We characterized several point mutations within the first subdomain of the FERM-like domain and find that mutation of Lys-38 to alanine results in a FAK mutant that is strongly hyperphosphorylated when expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes increased phosphorylation of the FAK substrate paxillin. A second mutation of Lys-78 to alanine results in a FAK mutant that is underphosphorylated, but can be activated by extracellular matrix stimuli. Like deletion of the amino terminus itself the K38A mutation is phosphorylated in suspension. The Δ375 truncation mutant of FAK is strongly phosphorylated both when Tyr-397 is mutated to phenylalanine, and in the presence of the Src inhibitor, PP2, suggesting that removal of the amino terminus can render FAK Src independent. This is in contrast to the K38A mutant that is not phosphorylated in the Y397F background, and which shows decreased phosphorylation in the presence of the Src inhibitor PP2, suggesting that regulation of FAK by Src is a secondary step in its activation. The K38A mutation weakens the interaction between the amino terminus of FAK and its own kinase domain, and disrupts the ability of the amino terminus to inhibit the phosphorylation of FAK in trans. The K38A mutation of FAK also increases the ability of FAK to promote cell cycle progression and cell migration, suggesting that hyperphosphorylation of this mutant can positively affect FAK function in cells. Together, these data strongly suggest a role for the first FAK subdomain of the FERM domain in its normal regulation and function in the cell. We have previously described regulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by its amino-terminal FERM-like domain through an autoinhibitory interaction with its kinase domain (Cooper, L. A., Shen, T.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FN, fibronectin; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FN, fibronectin; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; WT, wild type. is a 125-kDa tyrosine kinase that participates in signal transduction cascades stimulated by adhesion through integrin receptors to the extracellular matrix (1Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 2Zhao J.H. Guan J.L. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2000; 25: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 4Parsons J.T. J.

Clustering of integrins into forming focal adhesions upon attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix leads to the localization of FAK to these structures where it becomes strongly phosphorylated and interacts with other signaling molecules like Src, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, paxillin, p130 Cas, and Grb7. Phosphorylation of FAK is important in promoting FAK-dependent signal transduction because its phosphorylation state regulates the ability of these signaling molecules to interact with FAK (Src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and/or it regulates the catalytic activity of FAK that influences the ability of these molecules to become phosphorylated themselves (paxillin and p130 Cas for example). The phosphorylation and activity of FAK are strictly dependent on cell adhesion through integrin receptors, thus it is not surprising that FAK plays an important role in regulating events that are dependent on adhesion like cell cycle progression, and cell survival, or events, like cell migration where continual modulation of the interaction between the cell and the underlying extracellular matrix are necessary (1Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 2Zhao J.H. Guan J.L. Prog. Mol. Subcell.

Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of the activity of FAK by cell adhesion is complicated and involves a number of different factors. Localization of FAK to focal adhesions through its carboxyl-terminal region is essential for its normal regulation as most FAK mutants that do not localize properly to focal adhesions fail to become highly phosphorylated (7Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Ohngemach C. Romer L.H. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3247-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Shen Y. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Likewise artificially clustering integrins at the cell surface can mimic cell adhesion and allow the phosphorylation of FAK, suggesting that aggregation of β integrin cytoplasmic domains and their associated proteins is sufficient to allow phosphorylation of FAK (9Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15961-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FAK can also become phosphorylated in suspension when it is artificially dimerized, suggesting a potential role for transphosphorylation between FAK molecules in its activation (10Toutant M. Costa A. Studler J.M. Kadare G. Carnaud M. Girault J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In fact autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 is critical for most of the cellular functions of FAK including the phosphorylation of FAK at other residues (11Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol.

Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). This is inferred from the observation that mutation of this residue to phenylalanine blocks the phosphorylation of FAK at residues within the kinase domain and in the carboxyl terminus (11Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because mutation of Tyr-397 to phenylalanine disrupts binding of Src to FAK, it is believed that Src plays an important role in phosphorylating FAK (14Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibition of the Src family kinases using pharmacological inhibitors like PP2, or genetically removing Src family kinases from cells inhibits integrin-dependent phosphorylation of FAK both at Tyr-397 and other residues, suggesting that Src plays a key role in regulating the activity of FAK (15Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 16Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17788-17795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We and others have suggested that the amino-terminal domain of FAK, which contains a region sharing some sequence similarity to FERM domains, may play an important role in regulating the activity and phosphorylation state of FAK in cells (10Toutant M. Costa A. Studler J.M. Kadare G. Carnaud M. Girault J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Large truncations of the amino terminus of FAK are hyperphosphorylated, suggesting that the amino terminus exerts an inhibitory influence on the catalytic domain of FAK (10Toutant M. Costa A. Studler J.M. Kadare G. Carnaud M. Girault J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the amino terminus of FAK is capable of interacting with the kinase domain, and have suggested that this interaction is responsible for the inhibitory influence the amino terminus has on the activity of FAK within the full-length FAK molecule (17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We proposed a model in which the localization of FAK to forming the focal adhesion allows FAK to encounter a regulator that binds to the amino terminus and disrupts the interaction between the amino terminus and catalytic domain of FAK allowing the activation of FAK (17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model a group recently defined several mutations within the amino terminus of FAK that are underphosphorylated in growing cells, suggesting the possibility that these mutants are unable to interact with the upstream regulator and thus are unable to be fully activated (19Dunty J.M. Gabarra-Niecko V. King M.L. Ceccarelli D.F. Eck M.J. Schaller M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5353-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although it has clearly been established that the amino terminus of FAK has an influence over the activity and phosphorylation state of FAK, the exact nature of this role and how it influences the regulation of FAK remains controversial. In this study we identify two single point mutations within the first subdomain of the amino terminus of FAK that alter the phosphorylation state and regulation of FAK within the cell. We show that one of these point mutations leads to hyperphosphorylation of FAK and weakens the ability of the amino terminus to interact with the kinase domain. We also show that these mutations, which alter the phosphorylation of FAK, also affect FAK functions in the cell, promoting cell cycle progression and cell migration. Together, these data strongly suggest a role for the first FAK subdomain of the FERM domain in its normal regulation and function in the cell. Monoclonal anti-HA-conjugated agarose beads, mouse antibody against BrdU, protein A-Sepharose, human plasma fibronectin (FN), poly-l-lysine, and bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) were purchased from Sigma. The Src inhibitor PP2 and the control compound PP3 were purchased from Calbiochem. Lipofectamine and Plus reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. The mouse phosphotyrosine antibody PY20, and the mouse antibody against paxillin were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The rabbit antibody against paxillin (H-114), the mouse antibody against the myc tag (9E10), the rabbit antibody against the carboxyl terminus of FAK (C-20), and the rabbit antibody against hemagglutinin (Y-11) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The rabbit polyclonal FAK site-specific antibody against phosphorylated Tyr-397 (PY397) was purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). DNA Constructs—The 1–127 fragment of FAK was created by amplifying pBSFAK using the FAK 5′ BamHI (GTGGATCCATGGCAGCAGCTTACCTTGATCC) and FAK 127 3′ BamHI (GGATCCTCACCAAATTCTCAGTTC) primers. The resulting PCR fragment was purified and cut with BamHI and placed into the pkH3 vector at the corresponding site. Clones with the correct orientation were then selected. The 128–260 fragment was created by amplifying pBSFAK with the FAK 128 5′ BamHI (GGATCCTACCTGCCCAAAGG) and FAK 260 3′ EcoRI TGGAATTCACAGCTTTGGTATTGATGGTAAAGCTC), cutting the resulting fragment with BamHI and EcoRI and placing the fragment into the kH3 vector at the corresponding sites. The 261–376 fragment was created by amplifying pBSFAK with FAK 261 5′ BamHI (ACGGATCCGCCCTTGGTTCAAGCTGGATT) and FAK 376 3′ EcoRI (TGGAATTCAACACTTGAAGCATTCCTTGTCAAATC) primers and cutting the resulting PCR fragment with BamHI and EcoRI and placing it into the pkH3 vector at the corresponding sites. PkH3 WT-FAK, pkH3 FAK/F397, pkH3 FAK/KD, and pHAN FAK-WT all encoding full-length FAK were described previously (17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PkH3 Δ375, pkH3 Δ375/F397, and pkH3 Δ375/KD, the deletion mutants of FAK, were described previously (17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PkH3 NWT was described previously (17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The pkH3 FAK mutants described in this paper were generated by two-step PCR as follows. Two PCR fragments were generated by amplifying pBS FAK with FAK 5′ BamHI (GTGGATCCATGGCAGCAGCTTA CCTTGATCC) and a reverse mutagenesis primer, or the corresponding forward mutagenesis primer and FAK 400 3′ BamHI (GTGGATCCTTATATCTCTGCATACATCTG). The purified fragments were then mixed and subjected to a second round of PCR using FAK 5′ BamHI and FAK 400 3′ BamHI. The resulting 1.2-kb fragment was then digested with BamHI and MscI and placed into pkH3 FAK at the corresponding sites. The mutagenesis primers used were: K38A forward (GGGGCCATGGAGCGAGTCCTAGCGGTTTTTCAC), K38A reverse (GTGAAAAACCGCTAGGACTCGCTCCATGGCCCC), K78A forward (GTGCACTGTCACAAAGTGGCAAATGTGGCCTGC), K78A reverse (GCAGGCCACATTTGCCACTTTGTGACAGTGCAC), D101A forward (GGCTGCACCTGGCCATGGGGGTATCC), D101A reverse (GGATACCCCCATGGCCTGGTGCAGCC), R125A forward (GGAAATATGAACTGGCAATTCGGTACCTG), and R125A reverse (GGGCAGGTACCGAATTGCCAGTTCATATTTCC). The presence of the correct point mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The D101A mutant contained a second point mutation creating a L100Q/D101A double mutant. The FAK double mutants, pkH3 K38A/Y397F, and pkH3 K38A/KD were created by digesting pkH3 K38A with BamHI and MscI. The resulting fragment was isolated and placed into pkH3 FAK/F397 or pkH3 FAK/KD at the corresponding sites. Replacing the BamHI and MscI fragment of pkH3 NWT with the corresponding fragment from pkH3 K38A generated pkH3 NK38A. pEGFP-C3 paxillin was a generous gift from C. E. Turner. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). CHO cells were maintained in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% calf serum. Cells were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids as indicated using Lipofectamine™ following the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were conducted 24 h following transfection. Cells, which were replated, were serum starved for an additional 18 h. The cells were then briefly trypsinized, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and held in suspension for 60 min. Indicated cells were lysed. Cells replated on FN or poly-l-lysine were added to plates coated with 10 μg/ml FN or 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine for 60 min after being held in suspension. For experiments where cells were replated on FN in the presence of either the Src inhibitor PP2 or the control compound PP3, cells were serum starved overnight. The following day the cells were placed into suspension for 60 min in the presence of either 10 μm of the Src inhibitor PP2 or 10 μm of the control compound PP3. The cells were then replated onto FN-coated dishes for 30 min in the presence of the appropriate compound before being lysed. For lysis, subconfluent cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and total protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating cell lysates with appropriate antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma), or by incubating lysates with monoclonal HA antibody conjugated to agarose (Sigma). After washing, immune complexes were resolved using SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as a secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) and the Amersham Biosciences ECL system for detection. BrdU Incorporation Assays—Indicated HA-tagged constructs were transiently expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Cells were recovered for 3 h in 10% calf serum following the transfection, and then serum starved for 18 h to arrest the cells in G0. BrdU incorporation assay was conducted as described in Ref. 20Zhao J.H. Reiske H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were released from G0 by replating the cells in 10% calf serum and 150 μm BrdU. Following the indicated hours of growth, the cells were fixed, treated with DNase I, and processed for immunofluorescence against the HA epitope and BrdU. The percentage of nontransfected and transfected cells that had incorporated BrdU are represented as a mean of 4 experiments of 50–100 cells counted per condition. The error bars represent ± 1 S.D. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining as described previously (20Zhao J.H. Reiske H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were: anti-HA polyclonal antibody Y-11 (1:200), anti-FAK paxillin monoclonal antibody (1:100), and Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (1: 50; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The secondary antibodies used were: Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA). Cell Migration Assay—CHO cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs, and pEGFP. Cells were serum starved overnight following the transfection. Prior to assay a fluorescence image of the cells was taken and used to approximate the transfection efficiency. Cells were detached from plates using 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and washed two times. Cells were resuspended in F-12 media supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum. 1.25 × 104 cells were placed into the upper well of a Boyden chamber apparatus (neuroprobe). The bottom well of the Boyden chamber contained either F-12 supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum, or F-12 supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml FN as chemoattractant. Boyden chambers were placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 6 h. The remaining cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 200 mm NaCl, and 25 μg were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted as indicated. The polycarbonate membrane (neuroprobes) between the two chambers was removed and fixed in methanol for 10 min, after which it was removed, air dried, and stained with Giemsa stain. The cells on the upper side of the membrane were removed, and the migrated cells in the bottom of the membrane were placed onto a coverslip and visualized and counted at ×100. Each data point represents the average of four experiments, each of which includes a minimum of 7 wells per condition for the 5 μg/ml FN condition or 3 wells per condition for the 0 mg/ml FN condition. The error bars represent ± 1 S.D. The remaining cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 200 mm NaCl, and 25 μg were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted as indicated. The amino-terminal domain of FAK contains a region that shares some sequence similarity with the FERM domains of several proteins (21Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 751-769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal structures of several FERM domains are known, and they reveal a compact structure in which three distinct subdomains come together to form the overall clover-like structure (22Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 23Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. Acta Crystallogr.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To narrow down which residues within the amino-terminal region of FAK are involved in influencing its catalytic activity, we compared the amino acid sequence of the FERM-like region of FAK to that of several other FERM domain containing proteins (25Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We then compared this sequence alignment to the crystal structure of ezrin to define where the three subdomains might be within the FERM-like region of FAK (24Smith W.J. Nassar N. Bretscher A. Cerione R.A. Karplus P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We created three fragments corresponding to the three subdomains comprising residues 1–127, 128–260, and 261–376, respectively, and co-expressed a myc-tagged version of each fragment, the myc-tagged entire amino terminus (residues 1–400) or vector alone with HA-tagged full-length WT-FAK in CHO cells (see Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1b, expression of the whole amino terminus inhibited phosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine 397 consistent with our previously reported data showing that expression of the amino-terminal domain of FAK inhibited total phosphorylation of full-length FAK (17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two of the small fragments of the FERM domain of FAK, 1–127 and 128–260, were capable of inhibiting its phosphorylation at tyrosine 397 in trans, suggesting that more than one region of the FERM domain of FAK is involved in its regulation. A third fragment from residues 261 to 376 did not effect the phosphorylation of full-length FAK. Similar expression levels of the exogenously expressed full-length FAK were confirmed by blotting whole cell lysates with the C-20 antibody that recognizes the carboxyl terminus of FAK. The doublet recognized by this antibody is composed of a lower band corresponding to endogenous FAK, and an upper band corresponding to the HA-tagged exogenous FAK. To verify the identity of the upper band as HA-tagged FAK and to determine total phosphorylation, the lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-HA followed by Western blotting analysis with antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY20. Fig. 1c shows that FAK fragments 1–127, 128–260, and 1–400, but not 261–375, inhibited phosphorylation of HA-tagged FAK. Together, these results suggest that regions of FAK corresponding to the first and second subdomain of other FERM domains are important for the regulation of FAK. They also suggest that the presence and phosphorylation of Tyr-397 in the larger 1–400 amino-terminal construct is not important to its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of FAK. Mutation of FERM Domain Alters Phosphorylation of FAK—We and other groups have shown that truncation mutants of FAK as short as 125 residues are hyperphosphorylated, suggesting that these residues are likely to be important in the autoregulation of FAK (17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The ability of a fragment consisting of the first 127 amino acids to inhibit the phosphorylation of FAK in trans underscores the likely importance of these residues in the regulation of FAK. To further define what residues are involved in the influence of the amino terminus of FAK on its own catalytic activity, we compared the sequence alignment of the FERM-like region of FAK to that of other FERM domain containing proteins (25Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We looked for amino acid positions within this sequence alignment where a charged residue was often present. Based on these comparisons, we chose four residues within the first subdomain of the FERM-like region of FAK to mutate to alanine, Lys-38, Lys-78, Asp-101, and Arg-125 (Fig. 2a). An HA-tagged version of each of the mutants, WT-FAK, or the Δ375 truncation mutant of FAK were then transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Fig. 2b shows that three of the mutations, K78A, D101A, and R125A, showed PY397 levels slightly lower than WT-FAK. Interestingly, the K38A mutant showed increased phosphorylation at this residue, which suggests it has increased activity because phosphorylation at this residue is strongly correlated with activity (11Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the K38A mutant at Tyr-397 was similar to that of the Δ375 mutant, which we previously showed had increased activity in vitro (17Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). HA immunoblots confirmed that the exogenously expressed FAK constructs were expressed at similar levels, suggesting that differences in their phosphorylation were not attributable to differences in their expression level. Similar results were found in CHO cells (data not shown). To determine the total phosphorylation of the FAK mutants, we immunoprecipitated the exogenously expressed FAK from whole cell lysates using HA-conjugated agarose. Again antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots revealed that the D101A and R125A mutations had no effect on the general tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 2c). The K78A mutant showed decreased phosphorylation, and the K38A and Δ375 mutations were strongly hyperphosphorylated. Anti-HA immunoblots of the immunoprecipitates confirmed that equivalent amounts of the exogenously expressed FAK or FAK mutants were present. Similar results were found in CHO cells (data not shown). These results confirm that the K38A mutant of FAK is strongly hyperphosphorylated when expressed in mammalian cells. To see whether the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the K38A mutant can increase the phosphorylation of a FAK-dependent substrate in mammalian cells, we analyzed phosphorylation of paxillin by FAK and its mutants. As shown in Fig. 2d both WT-FAK and the K78A mutant of FAK were capable of inducing weak tyrosine phosphorylation of GFP-paxillin. Interestingly, the K38A mutant was capable of inducing strong phosphorylation of paxillin, to"
https://openalex.org/W2044031147,"Abstract The Drosophila genes, brainiac and egghead, encode glycosyltransferases predicted to act sequentially in early steps of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and both genes are required for development in Drosophila. egghead encodes a β4-mannosyltransferase, and brainiac encodes a β3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase predicted by in vitro analysis to control synthesis of the glycosphingolipid core structure, GlcNAcβ1–3Manβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer, found widely in invertebrates but not vertebrates. In this report we present direct in vivo evidence for this hypothesis. egghead and brainiac mutants lack elongated glycosphingolipids and exhibit accumulation of the truncated precursor glycosphingolipids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that despite fundamental differences in the core structure of mammalian and Drosophila glycosphingolipids, the Drosophila egghead mutant can be rescued by introduction of the mammalian lactosylceramide glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathway (Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer) using a human β4-galactosyltransferase (β4Gal-T6) transgene. Conversely, introduction of egghead in vertebrate cells (Chinese hamster ovary) resulted in near complete blockage of biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids and accumulation of Manβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer. The study demonstrates that glycosphingolipids are essential for development of complex organisms and suggests that the function of the Drosophila glycosphingolipids in development does not depend on the core structure."

GatDE is a heterodimeric amidotransferase that is ubiquitous in Archaea. GatD resembles bacterial asparaginases and is expected to function in amide donor hydrolysis. We show here that Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus GatD acts as a glutaminase but only in the presence of both Glu-tRNAGln and the other subunit, GatE. The fact that only Glu-tRNAGln but not tRNAGln could activate the glutaminase activity of GatD suggests that glutamine hydrolysis is coupled tightly to transamidation. M. thermautotrophicus GatDE enzymes that were mutated in GatD at each of the four critical asparaginase-active site residues lost the ability to hydrolyze glutamine and were unable to convert Glu-tRNAGln to Gln-tRNAGln when glutamine was the amide donor. However, ammonium chloride rescued the activities of these mutants, suggesting that the integrity of the ATPase and the transferase activities in the mutant GatDE enzymes was maintained. In addition, pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln accumulated during the reaction catalyzed by the glutaminase-deficient mutants or by GatE alone. The pyroglutamyl-tRNA is most likely a cyclized by-product derived from γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln, the proposed high energy intermediate in Glu-tRNAGln transamidation. That GatE alone could form the intermediate indicates that GatE is a Glu-tRNAGln kinase.

Although it is synthesized directly by glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) 1The abbreviations used are: GlnRS, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase; GluRS, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase; AdT, tRNA-dependent amidotransferase; GluAdT, Glu-tRNAGln-dependent AdT; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TLC, thin layer chromatography. in the eukaryotic cytoplasm and a few bacteria, most extant organisms including all Archaea and the majority of bacteria lack a functional GlnRS and therefore cannot attach glutamine directly to tRNAGln. Instead, these organisms rely on alternative enzymes to synthesize Gln-tRNAGln (2Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Min B. Namgoong S. Salazar J. Orellana O. So ̈ll D. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S.

Namgoong S. Salazar J. Orellana O. So ̈ll D. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2004: 314-319Google Scholar). Although transamidation of Glu-tRNAGln was first observed in the late 1960s (4Wilcox M. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), it took nearly three decades to reveal the nature of the AdT enzymes involved. We now know two types of AdT enzymes, a heterotrimeric AdT encoded by the gatC, gatA, and gatB genes found in bacteria and Archaea (5Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. So ̈ll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and a heterodimeric enzyme encoded by the gatD and gatE genes found exclusively in Archaea (6Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. So ̈ll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although GatCAB transamidates both Asp-tRNAAsn and Glu-tRNAGln, GatDE specifically acts as a GluAdT and recognizes only Glu-tRNAGln. Despite their differences in tRNA specificity and natural distribution, GatDE and GatCAB are evolutionarily related because GatE shares homology to GatB (6Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. So ̈ll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). No other homologs of GatE have been identified currently besides GatB, and their function in tRNA-dependent amidation remains unclear. On the other hand, sequence analyses indicate that GatA is homologous to amidases and that GatD is similar to asparaginases (5Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. So ̈ll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 6Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. So ̈ll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Both amidases and asparaginases belong to the glutaminase superfamily that catalyzes amide bond hydrolysis and the subsequent transfer of ammonia to a wide variety of amide acceptors (7Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, GatA and GatD could serve as the corresponding glutaminase subunit that provides the active ammonia for tRNA-dependent transamidation catalyzed by GatCAB and GatDE. Indeed, studies (8Harpel M.R. Horiuchi K.Y. Luo Y. Shen L. Jiang W. Nelson D.J. Rogers K.C. Decicco C.P. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6398-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Shin S. Lee T.H. Ha N.C. Koo H.M. Kim S.Y. Lee H.S. Kim Y.S. Oh B.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) on Streptococcus pyogenes GatCAB support the role of GatA as the glutaminase subunit and have identified Ser-172 within a Ser–cis-Ser–Lys catalytic triad of GatA as the potential nucleophile. In addition, the hydrolysis of glutamine by GatCAB was found to be coupled tightly to the overall transamidation of Glu-tRNAGln (10Horiuchi K.Y. Harpel M.R. Shen L. Luo Y. Rogers K.C. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6450-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The conversion of Glu-tRNAGln to Gln-tRNAGln by AdTs is a complex process and involves several partial reactions, including hydrolysis of ATP as well as glutamine. The reaction catalyzed by the heterotrimeric AdT GatCAB was proposed (11Wilcox M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to proceed via the γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln intermediate based on earlier experiments performed with crude extracts of Bacillus subtilis. However, the validity of this intermediate was cast in doubt when recent attempts (10Horiuchi K.Y. Harpel M.R. Shen L. Luo Y. Rogers K.C. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6450-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) failed to trap the intermediate with purified GatCAB enzymes. 2H. D. Becker, personal communication. Here we present our studies on the mechanism of tRNA-dependent transamidation using the archaeal-specific GluAdT GatDE as a model system. General—Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. l-[14C]Glu (256 mCi/mmol) and l-[14C]Gln (224 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and l-[3H]Glu (60 Ci/mmol) and l-[14C]pyroglutamic acid (200 mCi/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase was from Roche Applied Science, and recombinant 5-oxoprolinase was a generous gift of Dr. Hiroshi Oyama (Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan). Cloning and Purification of Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus Proteins—Cloning and purification of native M. thermautotrophicus GatDE and GluRS have been described previously (6Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. So ̈ll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the present study, the gatDE gene was cloned into pET20b to generate the pET20b-gatDE construct for the overexpression of a C-terminally His6-tagged protein. In addition, the plasmid pET28a-gatD was constructed to generate the N-terminally His6-tagged GatD subunit, and pET20b-gatE was used for the overexpression of the C-terminally His6-tagged GatE. Mutant gatD genes were generated by overlap extension PCR and cloned into pET28a-gatD or pET20b-gatDE to yield the corresponding His6-tagged GatD or GatDE proteins, respectively. The sequences of the cloned genes were verified by DNA sequencing prior to protein purification. The His6-tagged proteins were purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and further purified to homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography on a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences) that was developed with a 20–750 mm KCl gradient in Buffer A (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). Fractions containing the expected proteins judged by SDS-PAGE and activity were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into a storage buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol). The additional anion exchange chromatography step ensured that the purified His6-tagged GatD, GatE, and GatDE proteins were free of contaminating Escherichia coli glutaminase activities. Preparation of Aminoacylated tRNA—M. thermautotrophicus(tRNACUGGln2) transcript was prepared as described previously (6Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. So ̈ll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled aminoacylated tRNA substrates were prepared at 37 °C in an aminoacylation buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 75 μm [14C]Glu, 24 μg/ml pyrophosphatase, 0.5–2 μm transcript, and 2.4 μm GluRS and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, as described previously (12Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. So ̈ll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Residual ATP in the aminoacylated tRNAGln substrates was further removed by gel filtration with a Microspin G-25 or G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). Amidotransferase Assays—Unless specified otherwise, transamidation reactions were carried out in 1× AdT buffer (100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 mm ATP, 0.1–2 μm enzyme, and 0.14 μm [14C]Glu-tRNAGln (3,000 cpm) in the presence of 2 mm l-Gln or 10 mm NH4Cl or in the absence of any amide donor, as described previously (13Feng L. Stathopoulos C. Ahel I. Mitra A. Tumbula-Hansen D. Hartsch T. So ̈ll D. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The amino acids attached onto tRNA were recovered by ethanol precipitation and deacylated at room temperature for 2 min in the presence of 25 mm KOH followed by quenching with 1.3 μl of 0.1 n HCl. The reactions were dried completely under vacuum at room temperature, and the pellet was dissolved in 3 μlofH2O. The 14C-labeled amino acids were separated by TLC on a cellulose plate (Sigma) developed in a basic (water:ammonium hydroxide:methanol:chloroform, 1:2:6:6) or acidic solvent system (isopropanol:formic acid:water, 20:1:5) and visualized by phosphorimaging as described previously (5Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. So ̈ll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Both glutamate and glutamine were stable under these conditions, and no degradation products were visible. The TLC-based assay was used in the present study because the amount of 14C-labeled amino acids released represents a direct measurement of the amino acids attached to the tRNA. This method is sensitive and requires no further manipulation of the amino acids after their release from the tRNA. The deacylated amino acids could also be separated by HPLC after derivatization with a fluorescence probe (10Horiuchi K.Y. Harpel M.R. Shen L. Luo Y. Rogers K.C. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6450-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the HPLC-based method depends on the yield of derivatization of a given amino acid and approaches that of the TLC-based assay for glutamate and glutamine. However, other molecules of a less optimal derivatization yield might escape detection (see “Results”) (8Harpel M.R. Horiuchi K.Y. Luo Y. Shen L. Jiang W. Nelson D.J. Rogers K.C. Decicco C.P. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6398-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Glutaminase Activity Assay—Unlabeled or 3H-labeled Glu-tRNAGln was freshly made in 1× AdT buffer containing 4 mm ATP, 10 μm tRNAGln, 3 μmM. thermautotrophicus GluRS, and 400 μm unlabeled l-Glu or 200 μm3H-labeled l-Glu (0.3 Ci/mmol) and used directly in the glutaminase assay without further purification. The glutaminase assay was carried out at 37 °C in 0.8× AdT buffer containing 3.2 mm ATP, 25–32 μm l-[14C]Gln, 4–8 μm unlabeled or 3H-labeled Glu-tRNAGln substrates, and 0.3–1 μm enzymes. The reaction was quenched after 30 min with 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and the tRNA was removed by ethanol precipitation. The supernatant of the reaction was dried under vacuum at room temperature, and the pellet was dissolved in 7.5 μl of H2O. The TLC plates was spotted with 0.7 μl of the reaction and developed under acidic conditions (see above). Identification of Pyroglutamic Acid—14C-Labeled Glu-tRNAGln (0.17 μm) was incubated with GatDE (0.5 μm), GatE (2 μm), or no enzyme in the absence of amide donor in 1× AdT buffer at 37 °C for 20 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of sodium acetate to 0.3 m and subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (13Feng L. Stathopoulos C. Ahel I. Mitra A. Tumbula-Hansen D. Hartsch T. So ̈ll D. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The amino acids attached to tRNA were deacylated as described above. To prepare the pyroglutamic acid standard, an AdT reaction containing no enzyme but the same amount of unlabeled Glu-tRNAGln substrate was also prepared and processed the same way, except 8.4 pmol of 14C-labeled pyroglutamic acid was added after deacylation and neutralization treatment. The reaction mixtures were then dried under vacuum and resuspended in 3 μl of buffer containing 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, and 5% glycerol. The reaction products were analyzed by TLC directly under both basic and acidic conditions (see above) or after treatment with 5-oxoprolinase (0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. GatD Shares Homology with Asparaginases—GatD shares a high similarity with bacterial asparaginases (Fig. 1), enzymes that hydrolyze asparagine or glutamine to aspartate or glutamate and ammonia. The antileukemic activity of asparaginases has generated considerable interest in the enzyme, and crystal structures of asparaginases from many organisms including E. coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi have been solved (14Swain A.L. Jaskolski M. Housset D. Rao J.K. Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Aghaiypour K. Wlodawer A. Lubkowski J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5655-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The active site topology of asparaginases is unique among the different classes of glutaminases and does not contain the active site cysteine or serine found in other members of the family (7Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shin S. Lee T.H. Ha N.C. Koo H.M. Kim S.Y. Lee H.S. Kim Y.S. Oh B.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Labahn J. Neumann S. Buldt G. Kula M.R. Granzin J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Instead, a threonine residue located in a flexible loop near the N terminus is used as the primary nucleophile by asparaginases (17Palm G.J. Lubkowski J. Derst C. Schleper S. Rohm K.H. Wlodawer A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Ortlund E. Lacount M.W. Lewinski K. Lebioda L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and a well conserved Thr-Asp-Lys triad is found in the substrate-binding pocket (14Swain A.L. Jaskolski M. Housset D. Rao J.K. Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Aghaiypour K. Wlodawer A. Lubkowski J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5655-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicated that these active site residues are also conserved in GatD, and Thr-101, Thr-177, Asp-178, and Lys-254 in M. thermautotrophicus GatD may be important for asparagine/glutamine recognition (Fig. 1). The Glutaminase Activity of GatD Is Detected Only in the Presence of Glu-tRNAGln and GatE—The homology shared between GatD and asparaginases suggests that GatD is responsible for generating the active ammonia in GatDE. The actual amide donor used by GatDE remains to be determined, but both glutamine and asparagine can be used efficiently in vitro by M. thermautotrophicus GatDE (6Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. So ̈ll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For simplicity, only glutamine was used as the amide donor in this study. To test the proposed function of GatD as a glutaminase in GatDE, we purified both the GatDE holoenzyme and the two subunits individually and determined their abilities to hydrolyze glutamine. Although gatD and gatE are often found adjacent to each other in a given archaeal genome (6Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. So ̈ll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), both M. thermautotrophicus GatD and GatE could be expressed independently and purified to homogeneity. This contrasts with the fact that the amidase-like GatA from B. subtilis could not be expressed by itself (5Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. So ̈ll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Glutaminase activity was assayed by measuring the conversion of 14C-labeled glutamine to glutamate in the presence of unlabeled or 3H-labeled tRNA substrates or in their absence. As expected, GatE did not exhibit any glutaminase activity (Fig. 2, lane 2). To our surprise, GatD alone could not hydrolyze glutamine, whether in the presence or absence of the Glu-tRNAGln substrate (Fig. 2, lane 1). Instead, glutamine was hydrolyzed only by GatD when GatE was also included, whether co-purified with GatD as in the holoenzyme GatDE or when it was added later in trans (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, in the presence of ATP, only the mischarged Glu-tRNAGln substrate could induce the glutaminase activity of GatDE (Fig. 2A). Glutamine could not be hydrolyzed when tRNAGln was either uncharged (Fig. 2B) or absent (Fig. 2C). In addition, ATP enhanced the glutaminase activity of GatDE in the presence of Glu-tRNAGln, and the amount of glutamine hydrolyzed (in the 15-μl reaction) by GatDE increased from 0.04 μm in the absence of ATP to 4 μm in the presence of 3.2 mm ATP (data not shown). Interestingly, the amount of glutamine that was hydrolyzed by the holoenzyme GatDE (4 μm) matches well with the amount of the glutamate that was attached to tRNAGln (4 μm), suggesting that glutamine hydrolysis by GatDE is coupled tightly to Glu-tRNAGln recognition. This appears to be a common theme in the overall transamidation of Glu-tRNAGln, as has been found in the reaction catalyzed by S. pyogenes GatCAB (10Horiuchi K.Y. Harpel M.R. Shen L. Luo Y. Rogers K.C. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6450-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thr-101, Thr-177, Asp-178, and Lys-254 in GatD Are Important for the Glutaminase as well as the Transamidase Activity of M. thermautotrophicus GatDE—The inability of GatD alone to hydrolyze glutamine raises the question of its function as a glutaminase in GatDE. To further understand the role of GatD in GatDE, the putative asparaginase active site residues in GatD were mutated, and seven mutant M. thermautotrophicus GatDE enzymes (T101S, T101A, T177S, T177V, D178N, D178E, and K254E) were constructed, purified, and tested for glutamine hydrolysis. Glutamine hydrolysis by T101A, T177V, D178N, D178E, and K254E GatDEs was negligible (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 5–8), suggesting that these residues in GatD are important for the glutaminase activity of GatDE. However, the function of Thr-101 and Thr-177 could be replaced partially or completely by a serine residue. Under the conditions used, T177S GatDE hydrolyzed the same amount of glutamine (∼9 μm) as wild type GatDE (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4), whereas T101S GatDE converted approximately 1 μm of glutamine to glutamate (Fig. 3, lane 2). The functional replacement of the two active site threonine residues by a serine but not by alanine or valine indicates that the hydroxyl group of these threonine residues is important. These results demonstrate that GatD indeed acts as the bona fide glutaminase in GatDE. We then examined the effects of these mutations on the overall conversion of 14C-labeled Glu-tRNAGln to Gln-tRNAGln by GatDE using unlabeled glutamine as the amide donor. In this assay, amino acids attached to tRNA were separated from free amino acids by ethanol precipitation and then deacylated from tRNA prior to TLC separation and phosphorimaging analysis. In the presence of 2 mm glutamine, wild type and T177S transformed most of Glu-tRNAGln to Gln-tRNAGln, whereas T101S converted approximately half as much mischarged tRNA substrate to product (Fig. 4A). Thus, mutant GatDEs that were active in glutamine hydrolysis were also active in the overall transamidation of Glu-tRNAGln when glutamine was the amide donor. On the other hand, Gln-tRNAGln formation was undetectable in the GluAdT reaction catalyzed by the T101A, T177V, D178N, D178E, and K254E mutant GatDEs (Fig. 4A), consistent with their inability to hydrolyze glutamine (Fig. 3). However, the GluAdT activity of these mutants could be rescued partially by exogenous ammonia and was indistinguishable from that of the wild type enzyme in the presence of 10 mm NH4Cl (Fig. 4B). The formation of Gln-tRNAGln by the glutaminase-deficient GatDEs suggests that these mutants retained their ability to recognize Glu-tRNAGln. Gln-tRNAGln was not formed by GatDE when the amide donor was omitted from the AdT reaction (Fig. 4C). Instead, a molecule whose formation is independent of the glutaminase reaction appeared as the only product in the reaction catalyzed by all the GatDEs including wild type (Fig. 4C). This fast running molecule was later identified as pyroglutamate (see below), which had been deacylated from pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln prior to TLC separation. Pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln also accumulated in the reaction catalyzed by the glutaminase-deficient GatDEs when glutamine was the amide donor (Fig. 4A) or in the transamidation reaction catalyzed by all the GatDEs when NH4Cl was the amide donor (Fig. 4B). Pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln Is Formed by GatE Alone—The accumulation of pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln, a cyclized product of γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln (see below) in reactions catalyzed by mutant GatDEs carrying an inactive copy of GatD (Fig. 4), indicates that GatE might be responsible for its formation. Indeed, GatE alone catalyzed the formation of this aminoacyl-tRNA (Fig. 5A, lane 2), although at a lower efficiency than GatDE (Fig. 5A). The formation of the tRNA intermediate was not affected by the amide donor (data not shown) but depended on ATP (Fig. 5). The trace amount of the fast running molecule observed in the GatDE reaction in the absence of ATP was caused most likely by the residual ATP carried over from the Glu-tRNAGln preparation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Identification of the fast running molecule observed on our TLC plates was achieved by TLC (Fig. 6). The fast running molecule had the same migration characteristics as authentic 14C-labeled pyroglutamate under both basic and acidic conditions (Fig. 6). The identity of this molecule was further verified by enzyme analysis. The deacylated reaction products of GatE-catalyzed Glu-tRNAGln conversion contained approximately 20% fast running molecule and 80% glutamate (Fig. 6, lane 3). When this mixture was treated with 5-oxoprolinase, an enzyme that converts glutamate to pyroglutamate (19Nishimura A. Itoh H. Oyama H. Murao S. Oda K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), a single 14C-labeled molecule was observed (Fig. 6, lane 6). In addition, this molecule ran the same as the fast running molecule observed in the GatDE catalyzed reaction (Fig. 6, lane 5) as well as the pyroglutamate synthesized from glutamate by 5-oxoprolinase (Fig. 6, lane 7). Because of the minute quantity of the material (in the pmol range), our present attempts to prove the identity of the molecule by mass spectrometry were not successful. Conversion of pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln to Gln-tRNAGln in the presence of ammonia (e.g. compare Fig. 4, B and C) and the requirement of ATP for pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln formation (Fig. 5) could be explained if the pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln observed in our experiments is derived from the highly unstable γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln intermediate by dephosphorylation and cyclization (11Wilcox M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thr-101, Thr-177, Asp-178, and Lys-254 in GatD Are Also Important for the Activity of the Reconstituted GatDE—The effect of the Thr-101, Thr-177, Asp-178, and Lys-254 GatD mutations on GatDE catalysis was also examined using reconstituted GatDEs by combining GatE and mutant GatD in trans. For this purpose, six individual GatD mutants, T101S, T101A, T177S, T177V, D178N, and K254E, were generated and tested for Glu-tRNAGln transamidation. In general, the activity of the reconstituted mutant GatDE enzyme was lower than that of the holoenzyme. As expected, GatD was inactive toward Glu-tRNAGln transformation (Fig. 7A). However, the addition of GatE restored the transamidation activity of wild type and some mutant GatDs (Fig. 7, B and C). When glutamine was the amide donor, the activity profile of the reconstituted enzymes was similar to that of the holoenzymes (compare Figs. 4A and 7B). In the presence of 2 mm glutamine, Gln-tRNAGln was formed by the reconstituted T177S GatDE but not by the reconstituted T177V GatDE (Fig. 7B, lanes 4 and 5). A trace amount of Gln-tRNAGln was observed by adding GatE to the reaction of T101S GatD (Fig. 7B, lane 2), consistent with the partial glutaminase and transferase activities of the T101S GatDE holoenzyme (Figs. 3, lane 2, and 4A, lane 2). However, the ammonia-dependent activities of the reconstituted GatDE enzymes were slightly different from that of the holoenzyme. Although exogenous NH4Cl partially rescued the activity of the reconstituted wild type, T101S, T101A, and T177V GatDE enzymes (Fig. 7C, lanes 1–3 and 5), it could not rescue the activity of the rest of the reconstituted GatDE mutants. It is intriguing that the reconstituted T177S GatDE was inactive in the presence of 20 mm NH4Cl (Fig. 7C, lane 4), whereas it was active when glutamine was present (Fig. 7B, lane 4) or in the holoenzyme (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 4). Additional studies are required to resolve this issue. The data presented here provide support for the occurrence of the reactive γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln in the GatDE-catalyzed Glu-tRNAGln transamidation and can be summarized best in Scheme 1. As shown in Fig. 4, pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln accumulated in the transamidation of Glu-tRNAGln when the normal nucleophile ammonia was made unavailable by inactivating the glutaminase activity of GatDE or by removing the amide donor. Cyclization of glutamate to pyroglutamate occurs very slowly under physiological conditions, and non-enzymatic conversion of Glu-tRNAGln to pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln was not observed under normal assay conditions (Fig. 4, lane 9). However, when glutamate is activated by γ-phosphorylation and ammonia is unavailable, the nucleophilic attack of γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln by the internal α-amino group (Scheme 1, step 4) prevails even under mild basic conditions, resulting in the formation of pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln. Pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln was also detected in the transamidation of Glu-tRNAGln catalyzed by B. subtilis crude extracts but only after the reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C in 0.1 n HCl (11Wilcox M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln intermediate appears very reactive and unstable. Despite many efforts, we have not been able to trap the intermediate in the transamidation reaction of Glu-tRNAGln catalyzed by GatDE or purified GatCAB (10Horiuchi K.Y. Harpel M.R. Shen L. Luo Y. Rogers K.C. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6450-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln was demonstrated in partially purified enzyme preparations (11Wilcox M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), additional factors missing in our purified enzyme preparations may be required. The activation of glutamate by phosphorylation is also used by glutamine synthetase, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia (20Krishnaswamy P.R. Pamiljans V. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2932-2940Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Similarly, in the absence of ammonia, glutamine synthetase would catalyze only the formation of pyroglutamate from glutamate and ATP (20Krishnaswamy P.R. Pamiljans V. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2932-2940Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism used by GatDE therefore resembles that of glutamine synthetase (20Krishnaswamy P.R. Pamiljans V. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2932-2940Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), indicating that tRNA-dependent formation of glutamine and tRNA-independent formation of glutamine share mechanistic features. Transamidation of Asp-tRNAAsn catalyzed by GatCAB presumably also proceeds via γ-phosphoryl-Asp-tRNAAsn. However, dephosphorylation of γ-phosphorylated Asp-tRNAAsn would most likely produce the starting substrate Asp-tRNAAsn instead of a “pyroaspartyl-tRNAAsn,” because the formation of the cyclization product “pyroaspartic acid” (a four-membered ring molecule) would be energetically unfavorable. In line with this reasoning, no additional molecule besides Asp-tRNAAsn was observed in the transamidation of Asp-tRNAAsn when ammonia was unavailable. 3L. Feng, unpublished data. GatE alone can catalyze the formation of γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln, indicating that GatE is a tRNA-dependent kinase that phosphorylates the γ-carboxyl of the tRNAGln-linked glutamate. Therefore, GatE must not only bind ATP, but it also must recognize the mischarged tRNA substrate. However, the activity of GatE is lower than that of GatDE (Fig. 5), suggesting that efficient activation of Glu-tRNAGln requires the presence of the GatDE holoenzyme. The high similarity between GatB and GatE predicts that GatB in GatCAB has a similar role and catalyzes the formation of γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln or γ-phosphoryl-Asp-tRNAAsn. Recently, another tRNA-dependent kinase that phosphorylates Ser-tRNASec was also identified (21Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Kryukov G.V. Rao M. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This enzyme may play a role in the biosynthesis of selenocysteine. GatD is the glutaminase subunit in the GatDE enzyme, and our data suggest that Thr-101, Thr-177, Asp-178, and Lys-254 are critical for the glutaminase activity of M. thermautotrophicus GatD. Glutamine hydrolysis by GatD (Scheme 1, step 2) is coupled tightly to the activation of Glu-tRNAGln by GatE (Scheme 1, step 1). Unlike GatE, which is active by itself (Figs. 5 and 6), GatD alone is inactive as a glutaminase (Fig. 2). Instead, both GatE and the mischarged tRNA substrate are required to activate the glutaminase activity of GatD (Fig. 2). ATP is also required to achieve the full catalytic potential of GatD (data not shown). It is intriguing that the active site of GatD is deactivated in GatDE in the absence of the tRNA substrate. The coupling of glutamine hydrolysis (Scheme 1, step 2) to Glu-tRNAGln phosphorylation (Scheme 1, step 1) ensures the complete conversion of γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln to Gln-tRNAGln and therefore is essential for the faithful translation of the genetic message. Any uncoupling would lead to the accumulation of undesired products such as pyroglutamyl-tRNAGln. On the other hand, the γ-phosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln intermediate could be formed by GatE independent of glutamine hydrolysis by GatD (Fig. 5). The similarity of the AdT subunits GatA and GatD to the enzymes of amino acid metabolism (6Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. So ̈ll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the resemblance of the reaction mechanism of the Glu-tRNAGln-dependent transamidation to that of glutamine synthetase (20Krishnaswamy P.R. Pamiljans V. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2932-2940Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) may be remnants of an evolutionary link between amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis. We thank Dr. Jack F. Kirsch (University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA) for insight on the reaction mechanism, Dr. Hiroshi Oyama (Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan) for the 5-oxoprolinase, and Hong Jin (Yale University, New Haven, CT) for experimental help."

The underlying molecular cause of this disease is not well understood. Identifying binding partners for ALK1 will help to understand its cellular function. Using the two-hybrid system, we identified an ALK1-binding protein encoded by an ancient retroviral/retrotransposon element integrated as a single copy gene known as PEG10 on human chromosome 7q21. PEG10 contains two overlapping reading frames from which two proteins, PEG10-RF1 and PEG10-RF1/2, are translated by a typical retroviral -1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism. Reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot analysis showed a broad range of PEG10 expression in different tissues and cell types, i.e. human placenta, brain, kidney, endothelial cells, lymphoblasts, and HepG2 and HEK293 cells. However, endogenous PEG10-RF1 and PEG10-RF1/2 proteins were only detected in HepG2 and HEK293 cells. PEG10-RF1, which is the major PEG10 protein product, represents a gag-like protein, and PEG10-RF1/2 represents a gag-pol-like protein. PEG10-RF1 also interacts with different members of TGF-β superfamily type I and II receptors. PEG10-RF1 binding to ALK1 is mediated by a 200-amino acid domain with no recognized motif.

Ichijo H. Franzen P. Schulz P. Saras J. Toyoshima H. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2879-2887PubMed Google Scholar, 2Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massague J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). This family includes various forms of TGF-β, bone morphogenetic protein, activin, inhibin, nodal, Müllerian inhibitor substance, and growth and differentiation factors. All family members regulate different critical aspects of cell proliferation and differentiation, developmental patterning, and morphogenesis (3Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, 4Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar).The general model of signal transduction for the TGF-β superfamily is that signaling is mediated through a heteromeric complex of type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (5Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar, 6Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Binding of ligand to two type II receptors induces recruitment of two type I receptors. Subsequently, type I receptors become phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic GS domain because of the kinase activity of the constitutively phosphorylated type II receptor. Activated type I receptor then phosphorylates members of the receptor Smads. Upon phosphorylation, receptor Smads form a heterotrimeric complex with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus where they act as co-transcription factors on specific genes. Accumulating data shows that non-Smad signaling pathways can be activated by TGF-β such as the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases, and p38 (7Yue J.

Data from ALK1 and endoglin knock-out mice show that both genes play crucial roles in early embryonic angiogenesis (13Li D.Y. Sorensen L.K. Brooke B.S. Urness L.D. Davis E.C. Taylor D.G. Boak B.B.

Ligand binding assays for ALK1 suggested that it could be a type I receptor for TGF-β and/or activin, but no TGF-β and activin typical cellular responses were observed in initial experiments (1ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Schulz P. Saras J. Toyoshima H. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2879-2887PubMed Google Scholar, 2Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massague J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Therefore, ALK1 was classified as an orphan receptor. Subsequently, it was shown that activated ALK1 phosphorylates Smad1 and Smad5 (17Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 18Chen Y.G. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3672-3677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ALK1 ligand is a bone morphogenetic protein family member. However, we were able to show that ALK1 is a signaling receptor for TGF-β1 and -β3 (19Lux A. Attisano L. Marchuk D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9984-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This was further substantiated by a report that the ALK1-Smad1/5 pathway as well as the ALK5-Smad2/3 pathway are activated in a dose-dependent manner in endothelial cells by TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, respectively (20Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A. Sideras P. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated that human serum contains a third, so far unknown, ALK1-specific ligand that induces ALK1 signaling (19Lux A. Attisano L. Marchuk D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9984-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and that activated ALK1 inhibits TGF-β signaling, consistent with the finding that TGF-β-inducible genes like plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are up-regulated in ALK1 knock-out mice (16Oh S.P. Seki T. Goss K.A. Imamura T. Yi Y. Donahoe P.K. Li L. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Kim S. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2626-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Interestingly, endoglin also binds TGF-β1 and -β3 but not TGF-β2 and inhibits TGF-β signaling, although the mechanism is unclear (21Letamendia A. Lastres P. Botella L.M. Raab U. Langa C. Velasco B.

Blobe G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50788-50794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) are known to interact with ALK1. To identify other ALK1 binding partners, we performed a two-hybrid screen with the cytoplasmic part of ALK1. We found a new ALK1-interacting protein named PEG10-RF1. PEG10-RF1 is one of two proteins, PEG10-RF1 and PEG10-RF1/2, encoded by an ancient retroviral/retrotransposon element integrated into the human genome as a single copy gene. We report here the first human gene coding for two proteins caused by -1 ribosomal frameshifting. In addition, we show that co-expression of ALK1 and PEG10-RF1 induces profound changes in cell morphology that were not observed with other TGF-β type I and II receptors.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines—Cell media and fetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Invitrogen or PAA Laboratories. COS-1 and L6E9 cells were cultured in modified Dulbecco's medium + 10% FCS. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Hams F-12 medium + 10% FCS. R1B cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing nonessential amino acids and 10% FCS. HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/NUT MIX F-12 medium + 2 mm glutamine + 10% FCS. HMEC-1 cells were maintained in endothelial basal medium (PAA) + endothelial supplement (PAA) + 5% FCS. Primary HUVECs were cultured in M199 with Glutamax containing 20 mm HEPES, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 units of heparin, 10% FCS, 10% human serum, and 20 μg/ml ECGF. All of the cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment.Antibodies and Cytokines—Proteins tagged with the HA epitope were detected in immunoblots or precipitated with the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (19Lux A. Attisano L. Marchuk D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9984-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). N-terminal His-tagged proteins were detected or precipitated with the Anti-HisG or Anti-HisG-horseradish peroxidase antibodies from Invitrogen. TGF-β3 was purchased from R & D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). Human serum was a kind gift from the Blood Center (Mannheim, Germany).Yeast Strain, Transformation, and Two-hybrid Library Screen—For the two-hybrid screen and assays based on the Gal4 system, yeast strain PJ69-4A was used (26James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PJ69-4A allows protein-protein interaction monitoring because of three separate reporter genes HIS3, ADE2, and lacZ under the control of Gal4-inducible promoters GAL1, GAL2, and GAL7, respectively. This allows highly specific screens and reduces false positive clones/results, especially with the ADE2 selection. PJ69-4A is similar to the commercially available yeast strain AH109 (Clontech) except for the lacZ reporter gene.Yeast media and plates were prepared as described in the Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. Media ingredients were purchased from BIO101 Qbiogen. Yeast were transformed with the LiAc method (Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook). For the library screen, PJ69-4A was transformed with pGBT9-ALK1/c (see “Expression Constructs and Cloning”) as the bait. ALK1-transformed yeast were propagated in large scale and subsequently transformed with a MATCHMAKER placenta cDNA library (Clontech) that had been cloned into the pGAD10 vector with the Gal4 activation domain. Transformed yeast were plated on Hisplates. Colonies appearing after 2-5 days were transferred onto Adeplates. Colonies that showed growth on both His- and Adeplates were further tested in the β-galactosidase (β-gal) filter assay. Plasmid DNA from positive yeast clones was isolated and transformed into bacteria by electroporation, and isolated plasmid DNA from transformed bacteria was used for further analyses.Expression Constructs and Cloning—TGF-β type I, II, and III receptors used in this study are human ALK1 (19Lux A.

Genet. 2000; 9: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All of the receptors are in the pCMV5 vector and have a C-terminal HA tag.Mutations/amino acid changes in the ALK1 coding sequence were introduced with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Annotations correspond to the changed amino acid positions: ALK1W50C, ALK1R67Q, ALK1Q201D (activation mutation), ALK1K229R, ALK1ΔS232, ALK1S331W, ALK1R374W, ALK1R411Q, ALK1/cM376, and ALK1P424T.For the two-hybrid screen and different two-hybrid assays the following vectors were used: (a) pGBT9 (Clontech) with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, (b) pGBDU2 (26James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and (c) pGAD424 (Clontech) with the Gal4 activation domain. The coding sequence for the cytoplasmic domain of the different type I and II receptors that were tested with the two-hybrid system was amplified by PCR and fused in frame to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain or activation domain, respectively, of the appropriate vector. ALK1 wild-type (ALK1/c142-503) and ALK1Q201D were cloned into the EcoRI/SalI restriction sites of pGBT9. ALK4 and ALK5 were cloned into the HindIII/BamHI restriction sites of pGBT9. ActRII and TβRII were cloned into the EcoRI/SalI restriction sites of pGBDU2.The ALK1 two-hybrid screen yielded one interacting partner with two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). ORF1 codes for the ALK1-binding protein PEG10-RF1. For further two-hybrid analyses, ORF1 was PCR-amplified and cloned into the EcoRI/SalI restriction sites of pGAD424 and GBDU2. For domain interaction assays between ALK1 and PEG10-RF1 in the two-hybrid system, different parts of the coding sequences of ALK1 and PEG10-RF1were PCR-amplified and cloned into the EcoRI/SalI restriction sites of pGBT9 or EcoRI/BamHI restriction sites of pGAD424, respectively. The following constructs were created and cloned into pGBT9: ALK1/c142-245, ALK1/c142-386, ALK1/c223-466, ALK1/c223-386, ALK1/c223-353, ALK1/c303-386, ALK1/c303-353, ALK1/c340-386, ALK1/c340-466, ALK1/c340-503, and ALK1/c434-503. PEG10-RF176-199, PEG10-RF1183-275, PEG10-RF1260-325, PEG10-RF176-275, PEG10-RF1152-275, PEG10-RF1172-275, PEG10-RF1172-237, and PEG10-RF1183-325 were cloned into pGAD424. The numbers correspond to the amino acids at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the amplified coding sequences. The construct PEG10-RF11-103 was created differently. The PEG10-RF11-103 fragment was excised from pGAD424-PEG10-RF1 by EcoRI/BglII digest and cloned into the EcoRI/BglII restriction sites of pGBDU2.For expression in mammalian cells and immunoprecipitation assays, PEG10-RF1 (ORF1) was PCR-amplified and fused to the N-terminal His tag of the pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Also, PEG10-RF1/2 (ORF1 and ORF2) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and fused to the N-terminal His tag of the pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO vector.For fluorescence microscopy studies, PEG10-RF1 (ORF1) was PCR-amplified and fused to the C-terminal EYFP sequence of the pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech) resulting in PEG10-RF1YFP. Also, ALK1, ALK5, and TβRII were PCR-amplified and fused to the C-terminal ECFP sequence of the pECFP-N1 vector (Clontech) resulting in the following constructs: ALK1CFP, ALK5CFP, and TβRIICFP. The correct sequences and reading frames of all of the constructs derived from PCR products were verified by automated DNA sequencing with an ABI 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany).Northern Blot and RT-PCR—Northern blot hybridization was done with a multiple tissue Northern blot from Clontech at 50 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. PEG10 DNA was randomly labeled with DIG-11-dUTP using the DIG High Prime DNA labeling and detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bound DNA was detected by chemiluminescence with the Lumi-Imager F1™ (Roche Applied Science).For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from abdominal microvascular endothelial cells, breast microvascular endothelial cells, U937 immortalized monocytes, immortalized lymphoblasts (Coriell cell repositories, GM00131), primary HUVECs, HMEC-1 endothelial cells, HepG2 cells, and HEK293 cells. Total RNA was prepared using either the Invitrogen TRIzol® reagent protocol or the Qiagen RNeasy® spin column protocol. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl volume using a mixture of oligo(dT) oligonucleotides and pd(N)6 random hexamers by the Fermentas RevertAid H Minus M-MuLV protocol (Fermentas, St.Leon-Rot, Germany) or with the Omniscript® RT Kit (Qiagen). For PCR, the following primer combinations were used: PEG10 F2, 5′-cagaggagtcctcgcgtg-3′ (exon 1 specific, forward primer); PEG10 R2, 5′-ggatggaggcctggatcc-3′ (exon 2 specific, reverse primer), across intron; and PEG10 F7/R7, 5′-ctcaatcagtgactgtgtgc-3′/5′-tccatagccgtttcagagag-3′, located in exon 2.PCR was performed as follows: 1 μl of cDNA was added to 1× PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dNTP), 10 pmol of forward primer, 10 pmol of reverse primer, and 1 unit of Platinum® Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. These samples were then held at 95 °C for 5 min and cycled 35 times at 95 °C for 45 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. This was then held at 72 °C for a further 7 min. The PCR products were then run on a 2% agarose gel.PEG10-RF1-specific Polyclonal Antibodies—Generation of PEG10-RF1-specific polyclonal antibodies was done by EUROGENTEC (Belgium). The rats were immunized with the peptide combination H2N-TERRRDELSEEINNC-CONH2 (amino acids 2-15) and H2N-REQV-EPTPEDEDDDIE-CONH2 (amino acids 45-60) generating antibody SAON1. A second antibody, SAOP2, was generated by immunization with peptide H2N-CKASKSSPAGNSPAPL-COOH (amino acids 311-325). The specificity of PEG10-RF1 antibodies was tested in comparison with the preimmune sera of rats that were not able to detect PEG10 proteins. Specificity was further shown in Western blots blocking binding of antibodies to PEG10 with increasing amounts of peptides used for immunization (see Fig. 1 in the supplemental material).Transient Transfections, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blots—COS-1 cells were cultured in 6-well plates to 70-80% confluence. For transfections, 6 μl of FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) and 2 μg of DNA/well were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were transfected with: (a)2 μg of empty vector, (b)1 μg receptor cDNA or PEG10-RF1 and 1 μg vector, or (c) in co-transfections with two different expression constructs, 1 μg of each. Two days posttransfection, the cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysate was precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences; dissolved in lysis buffer (v/v)) for 3 h. 300 μl of precleared lysate was incubated overnight with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose and the indicated monoclonal antibodies at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose immunocomplex was then washed three times in 500 μl of lysis buffer and resolved in 15 μl of Laemmli buffer. 20 μl of precleared lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Machery & Nagel; Amersham Biosciences) for immunodetection with the indicated antibody. Immunodetection was performed with the SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For chemiluminescence detection, the Lumi-Imager F1™ (Roche Applied Science) was used.Immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Microscopy—To assess the endogenous cellular localization of PEG10 proteins, HepG2 cells were seeded on coverslips. After 1 day, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, the cells were washed for 5 min in quenching solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) and then permeabilized for 20 min in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. After permeabilization, the cells were washed two times with PBS. For immunofluorescence detection, the PEG10-RF1-specific antibody SAON1, as well as the SAON1 preimmune serum, were used in a 1:200 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS and the TRITC-labeled secondary goat anti-rat antibody (Dianova) was used in a 1:400 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. To block unspecific bindings, the cells were incubated for 1 h in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, washed once with PBS, and then incubated at room temperature in a wet chamber with the SAON1 antibody or the SAON1 preimmune serum. After 1 h, the cells were washed five times for 5 min with PBS and then incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h in a wet chamber at room temperature. The cells were washed again five times for 5 min with PBS, and after a final wash with distilled water, the coverslips were mounted with Mowiol onto microscope slides.For further fluorescence microscopy studies, the PEG10-RF1YFP fusion protein construct was transiently transfected into COS-1, CHO-K1, L6E9, and HepG2 cells alone or in various combinations with different type I and type II receptors. The cells were transfected with the indicated constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, approximately 70% confluent cells were transfected, and the expression of fluorescence proteins was examined in a time range of 1-4 days with a fluorescence microscope. For fluorescence imaging of living cells, the images were taken with a Hamamatsu C4880-80 CCD camera with OpenLab 2.2.5 software (Improvision, Tübingen, Germany) and a Zeiss Axiovert 25 microscope with 40× magnification. For pictures of fixed cells, an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and the AxioCam MRM (Zeiss) were used supported by the AxioVision 3.1 software (Zeiss).Luciferase Reporter Assay—The luciferase assay was done as described previously (19Lux A. Attisano L. Marchuk D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9984-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In brief, R-1B cells were transiently transfected with the luciferase transcriptional reporter pGL3-(SBE)4 (a Smad response reporter) (29Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and empty vector DNA or the indicated receptor cDNA. The pSV-β-galactosidase vector (pSV-β) (Promega) was always included to normalize the luciferase activity for the different transfections. After a 16-h incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed for 15 min in 80 μl of lysis buffer. 50 μl were used to measure the luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and the Lumi-Imager F1™ (Roche Applied Science). The remaining 30 μl of lysates were used to measure the amount of β-galactosidase. Luciferase activity was corrected for β-galactosidase.RESULTSA New Intracellular ALK1-binding Protein—To identify new intracellular interacting partners for ALK1, an improved Gal4 yeast two-hybrid system was used (26James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A human placenta cDNA library was screened with the entire ALK1 cytoplasmic domain (ALK1/c) yielding one clone that was able to grow on His- and Ade-selection plates and turned blue in the β-gal filter assay after about 2 h compared with 1 h for the p53/large T-antigen (pAV3/pTD) positive control.The ∼6-kb insert sequence of the candidate plasmid was used in a GenBank™ BLASTn search revealing 100% identity to cDNAs deposited as KIAA1051 (GenBank™ accession number AB028974) and HB-1 (GenBank™ accession number AF216076) of almost 6.2 kb length, and mRNA 23915 (Gen-Bank™ accession number AF038197) of 1.5 kb length corresponding to the 3′-end of KIAA1051 and HB-1. All entries described a cDNA for a protein with unknown function. Our clone was ∼100 bp shorter at its 5′-end than the published sequences. Analysis of the KIAA1051 sequence for an ORF revealed two ORFs, one of ∼1 kb (ORF1) and one of 1.1 kb (ORF2), a 200-bp long 5′-untranslated region, and a large 3′-untranslated region of about 4 kb. ORF2 overlaps with ORF1 by 60 bp. In our two-hybrid clone the third amino acid of ORF1 was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, whereas the second ORF was out of frame by a -1"
https://openalex.org/W2004464897,"We previously identified a 10-amino acid region from the Y domain of phospholipase Cβ2 (PLCβ2) that associates with G-protein βγ subunits (Sankaran, B., Osterhout, J., Wu, D., and Smrcka, A. V. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7148–7154). We mapped the site for cross-linking of a synthetic peptide (N20K) corresponding to this Y domain region to Cys25 within the amino-terminal coiled-coil domain of Gβγ (Yoshikawa, D. M., Bresciano, K., Hatwar, M., and Smrcka, A. V. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11246–11251). Here, further experiments with a series of variable length cross-linking agents refined the site of N20K binding to within 4.4–6.7 Å of Cys25. A mutant within the amino terminus of the Gβ subunit, Gβ1(23–27)γ2, activated PLCβ2 more effectively than wild type, with no significant change in the EC50, indicating that this region is directly involved in the catalytic regulation of PLCβ2. This mutant was deficient in cross-linking to N20K, suggesting that a binding site for the peptide had been eliminated. Surprisingly, N20K could still inhibit Gβ1(23–27)γ2-dependent activation of PLC, suggesting a second N20K binding site. Competition analysis with a peptide that binds to the Gα subunit switch II binding surface of Gβγ indicates a second N20K binding site at this surface. Furthermore, mutations to the N20K region within the Y-domain of full-length PLCβ2 inhibited Gβγ-dependent regulation of the enzyme, providing further evidence for aGβγ binding site within the catalytic domain of PLCβ2. The data support a model with two modes of PLC binding to Gβγ through the catalytic domain, where interactions with the amino-terminal coiled-coil domain are inhibitory, and interactions with the Gα subunit switch II binding surface are stimulatory. We previously identified a 10-amino acid region from the Y domain of phospholipase Cβ2 (PLCβ2) that associates with G-protein βγ subunits (Sankaran, B., Osterhout, J., Wu, D., and Smrcka, A. V.

The data support a model with two modes of PLC binding to Gβγ through the catalytic domain, where interactions with the amino-terminal coiled-coil domain are inhibitory, and interactions with the Gα subunit switch II binding surface are stimulatory. Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors releases the Gβγ subunit from Gα-GTP, leaving Gβγ free to interact with effector molecules such as enzymes or ion channels (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4711) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 3Clapham D.E.

A particular group of enzymes regulated by Gβγ belong to the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; SMCC, succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; WT, wild type; OG, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; SIGK, SIGKAFKILGYPDYD; SIRK, SIRKALNILGYPDYD.1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; SMCC, succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; WT, wild type; OG, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; SIGK, SIGKAFKILGYPDYD; SIRK, SIRKALNILGYPDYD. class. Once activated, PLCβ cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into the two second-messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. All PLCβ isoforms have an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, four sets of EF-hand domains, X and Y domains comprising the catalytic center, and a C2 domain followed by a C-terminal extension (4Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). There are four isoforms of PLCβ, β1–4; however, only PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 are regulated by βγ subunits (5Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-protein β subunits have two distinct domains, an N-terminal α helix, which forms a coiled-coil interaction with the γ subunit, and a seven-blade β-propeller structure composed of seven WD repeating motifs (6Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 7Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Amino acids within blades one, two, and three make extensive contacts with α-GDP (7Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Since α subunits block Gβγ-dependent regulation of all effectors, effector-binding sites on Gβγ were predicted to overlap with the α subunit binding site. Indeed, mutagenesis of particular amino acids on Gβγ important for α subunit binding blocked activation of PLCβ2 (9Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shektar L.R. Rosal R. Weng G.

Furthermore, mutations to the outer strands of blades 2, 6, and 7, which do not make direct contact with Gα, rendered Gβγ unable to effectively activate PLCβ2 (11Panchenko M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P.M. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mechanism for regulation of PLCβ2 by Gβγ subunits is not fully understood. Approaches for elucidating the activation mechanism have been to characterize the effects of a variety of mutants, peptides, and fusion proteins on regulation of PLCβ2 by Gβγ. Two major regions on PLCβ2 have been implicated as Gβγ-binding sites, the N-terminal PH domain and a portion of the catalytic Y domain. A large body of evidence supports a role for interactions between the catalytic domain of PLCβ2 and Gβγ subunits. Overexpression of the Y domain in COS-7 cells blocked receptor-mediated Gβγ-dependent, but not Gαq-dependent activation of PLC. A purified glutathione S-transferase fusion protein comprising amino acids 526–641 of the Y-domain bound directly to purified Gβγ subunits (12Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Overlapping peptides representing a portion of the Y-domain directly cross-linked to both Gβ and Gγ subunits with the heterobifunctional cross-linker SMCC, and this was blocked by purified PLCβ2 but not αi. The peptides also inhibited Gβγ regulation of PLCβ2 with an EC50 of 30–50 μm (13Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PLCδ reveals that the region implicated by the peptide studies corresponds to the α5 helix on the surface of the catalytic domain and therefore is accessible to interact with Gβγ subunits (14Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that direct binding of this helix within the catalytic domain to Gβγ is involved in Gβγ-dependent PLCβ2 activation. To define the site cross-linking of one of the catalytic domain peptides, N20K (amino acids 565–574 in PLCβ2), to the Gβ subunit and identify a potential Y-domain interaction site on Gβ, we used a systematic cysteine mutagenesis approach where each cysteine on Gβ1 was individually mutated to alanine. The cysteine residue critical for the majority of peptide cross-linking was cysteine 25 within the amino-terminal coiled-coil region of Gβ (15Yoshikawa D.M. Bresciano K. Hatwar M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11246-11251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This region is outside the Gα subunit-binding site, complementing data demonstrating that Gαi1 could not block cross-linking of N20K to Gβγ (13Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Yoshikawa D.M. Bresciano K. Hatwar M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11246-11251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous studies have not implicated the amino terminus of Gβγ as an important effector signaling site in mammals, although it has been implicated to be important in the yeast pheromone pathway (16Dohlman H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Leberer E. Dignard D. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4805-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the amino-terminal coiled-coil of Gβγ directly binds to the α5 helix of the Y-domain to regulate PLC activity. The goals of this study were 3-fold: 1) to further delineate the specific region within the amino terminus of Gβγ subunits that interact with PLCβ; 2) to demonstrate a functional role for the amino terminus of Gβ in mammalian effector regulation; and 3) to demonstrate the functional importance of the N20K region within full-length PLC for Gβγ regulation. These results would be the first demonstrating a specific region on PLC interacting with a specific region on Gβγ, leading to a better understanding of how Gβγ subunits regulate PLC. Materials—Peptides (N20K, Ac-NRSYVISSFTELKAYDLLSK; SIGK, Ac-SIGKAFKILGYPDYD; L9A, Ac-SIRKALNIAGYPDYD) were purchased from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX) and had purity greater than 90% based on HPLC chromatography analysis. The masses of the peptides were confirmed by mass spectroscopy. All cross-linking reagents used in this study were from Pierce. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Qiagen. [3H]PIP2 and [32P]NAD were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Pertussis toxin was purchased from List Biologicals. All molecular biology reagents were from Invitrogen, unless otherwise indicated. Baculoviruses encoding wild type Gβ1, His6-Gαi, and Gγ2 were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Alfred Gilman. Construction of Gβ Subunit and PLCβ2 Mutants—Mutants in rat Gβ1 and in human PLCβ2 were constructed by overlap-extension PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) using standard protocols. Final constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation. Bacoluviruses were generated as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Purification of βγ Subunits—Gβ1γ2 subunits were purified from 2 liters of Sf-9 cells triply infected with His6-Gαi1, wild type or mutant Gβ1 subunits, and Gγ2 subunits essentially as described (18Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Sf-9 cell membranes were prepared as described (18Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and then extracted in buffer A containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm GDP, 50 mm NaCl, 1% polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether (C12E10), and a protease inhibitor mixture for 2 h at 4 °C. Detergent-extracted proteins were diluted 5-fold with buffer B, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm GDP, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% C12E10, and a protease-inhibitor mixture and loaded onto a 4-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column at 4 °C overnight. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer B containing 300 mm NaCl and 5 mm imidazole, warmed at room temperature for 15 min, and washed with 12 ml of the same buffer followed by 5 ml of buffer B containing 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG). Gβγ subunits were eluted with 3 column volumes of buffer C, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 μm GDP, 50 mm NaCl, 1% OG, 3 mm imidazole, 50 mm MgCl2, 30 μm AlCl3, and 10 mm NaF followed by 4 volumes of buffer C with 1% cholate instead of OG. With this modified procedure, endogenous Sf-9 Gβγ elutes in the first fraction, and the expressed Gβγ elutes in fractions 2–5. Peak elutions, devoid of Sf-9 endogenous Gβγ, were combined, concentrated on a 0.5-ml hydroxyapatite column, and eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% OG, and 200 mm KPi, pH 8.0. Protein concentrations were determined by an Amido Black assay. To confirm purity, 500 ng of purified wild type or mutated Gβγ subunits were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue G250 stain. To confirm proper assembly of the mutant Gβ subunits with Gγ subunits, equal amounts of wild type and mutant Gβγ subunits were run on a 17% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with Gγ subunit antibody, X263. Purification of Wild Type and Mutant PLC—Wild type His6-PLCβ2 and His6-PLCβ3 were purified from 1 liter of Sf-9 cells as described (19Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These wild type PLCβs were used for measuring activation by mutated Gβγ subunits. Mutant PLCs were purified using a protocol similar to the wild type 1-liter protocol from 50-ml cultures of Sf-9 cells, except buffer volumes were scaled down, and 1 ml of nickel resin was used (the heparin column was omitted). For experiments comparing the activities of PLCβ2 mutants, wild type and mutant enzymes were purified simultaneously and in parallel, snap-frozen in liquid N2 in single use aliquots, and stored at –70 °C. Phospholipase C Assays—PLC assays were performed as described (19Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The concentrations of PLC, Gβγ, and detergent are indicated in the figure legends. Assays measuring peptide or Gα subunit inhibition of Gβγ-dependent PLC activation were performed exactly as described (13Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Assays measuring Gαq activation of PLC were performed as described (5Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments, a maximum of 20% of the PIP2 substrate was hydrolyzed. Measurement of ADP-ribosylation of Gαi1—Pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of 15 pmol of Gαi1 in the presence of Gβγ was measured as described (20Casey P.J. Pang I.-H. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Myr-Gαi was purified from Escherichia coli as described (21Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Chemical Cross-linking—All cross-linkers used in this study, succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), N-[ϵ-maleimidocaproyloxy]succinimide ester, N-[γ-maleimidobutyryloxy]succinimide ester, N-[α-maleimidoacetoxy]succinimide ester, and N-succinimidyl iodoacetate, were heterobifunctional, containing both sulfhydryl and amine reactive groups. The functional groups for all cross-linkers except N-succinimidyl iodoacetate had N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester and maleimide reactive moieties; N-succinimidyl iodoacetate had an iodoacetate group instead of a maleimide. All of the peptides used contained no cysteine residues and were N-terminally acetylated, so cross-linking was through the ϵ-amine of lysine residues. To prevent cross-linking of Gβ to Gγ, peptides were preincubated with cross-linker prior to the addition to Gβγ by use of the following protocol. Peptides at 2 times their final concentration (see figure legends for concentrations) were incubated with 400 μm cross-linker in cross-linking buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% C12E10 at room temperature for 10 min. Ethanolamine, pH 8, was then added to 100 mm to quench all unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester groups. 50 μl of the peptide/cross-linker mix was added to 50 μl of 60 nm Gβγ diluted in cross-linking buffer and allowed to incubate at room temperature before quenching with 33 μl of 4× sample buffer (4× sample buffer: 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 1.4 m β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue) (times for each reaction are listed in the figure legends). The final concentrations were 30 nm Gβγ and 200 μm cross-linker; the peptide concentrations are listed in the figure legends. 10 μl of the reactions were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a Gβ subunit-specific antibody B-600 followed by an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Delineation of the N20K Binding Site on Gβγ—Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated two overlapping peptides from the catalytic domain of PLCβ2, N20K, and E20K (amino acids 564–584 and 574–594, respectively) could be chemically cross-linked to Gβ subunits (13Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Yoshikawa D.M. Bresciano K. Hatwar M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11246-11251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Based on this, and other studies, we hypothesized the 10-amino acid region of overlap between these peptides, ELKAYDLLSK (amino acids 574–584), representing an α helix on the surface of PLCβ2, directly bound to Gβγ subunits. To define this potential PLCβ2 interaction site on Gβγ, we mapped a cross-linking site for the N20K peptide using a cysteine to alanine mutagenesis approach (15Yoshikawa D.M. Bresciano K. Hatwar M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11246-11251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). From this data, it was determined the sulfhydryl group of cysteine 25 is within reach of the peptide-binding site. However, since the cross-linker, SMCC, had a spacer arm length of 12 Å, we could only conclude the peptide was binding within a 15-Å radius of cysteine 25 (the length of the spacer arm in the SMCC cross-linker plus the length of a lysine side chain). To further refine the nature of the N20K interaction within Gβγ, we determined which residue(s) in N20K was involved in cross-linking. Since N20K has no cysteine residues and is acetylated at the amino terminus, the cross-linking must be through a one or both of the two ϵ-amine moieties on the lysine residues within the last 10 amino acids of N20K. Two N-terminally acetylated peptides were constructed, R1 and R2, where each lysine residue was individually replaced with arginine (Fig. 1A), abolishing a cross-linkable primary amine but retaining the peptide's charge. Both R1 and R2 cross-linked to βγ with SMCC (Fig. 1B), indicated by the appearance of a higher molecular weight immunoreactive Gβ subunit band only in the presence of peptide and cross-linker, although neither was as effective as N20K. Cross-linking of both of these peptides to Gβ1 subunits where Cys25 was mutated to alanine (Gβ1(C25A)) was substantially inhibited. To further restrict the radius of binding of these two lysine residues, cross-linkers with various spacer arms (12–1.5 Å) were used to cross-link R1 and R2 to Gβγ. Both R1 and R2 effectively cross-linked to Gβγ with N-[γ-maleimidobutyryloxy-]succinimide ester (6.7 Å) but not N-[α-maleimidoacetoxy]succinimide ester (4.4 Å) (Fig. 1C), demonstrating both that lysine residues are approximately equidistant from Cys25 and that the site of binding of N20K to Gβγ is within 4.4–6.7 Å of Cys25. Purification of Amino-terminal Site-directed Mutants of βγ Subunits near Cys25—The cross-linking data suggest a PLC binding site in the amino terminus of Gβγ within 7 Å of cysteine 25. Therefore, surface amino acids in the coiled-coil region of Gβγ within 10 Å of cysteine 25 were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis to confirm a functional role for the Gβγ N terminus in PLC regulation. Six amino acids on Gβ and six amino acids on Gγ neighboring cysteine 25 were mutated three amino acids at a time. The mutations were named Gβ1(17–21) and Gβ1(23–27) based on the stretches of amino acids where the mutations were located (Fig. 2A). Similar mutations made in Gγ2 failed to dimerize with Gβ1 and were not analyzed further. Wild type and mutant Gβγ dimers were purified simultaneously and in parallel to near homogeneity in one step based on binding to His6-Gαi and elution by activation of the Gα subunit with AlF–4 (Fig. 2B). This purification strategy insured that the mutants were properly assembled, folded, and functional. Proper assembly with the Gγ subunit was confirmed by immunoblotting for the presence of Gγ subunits in the purified mutant preparations (Fig. 2C). The proteins were >90% pure based on Coomassie Blue staining. No detectable endogenous Sf-9 Gβ (which runs at a higher molecular weight than overexpressed mammalian Gβ1) was detected on either a Coomassie Blue-stained gel or immunoblots with an antibody that recognizes both endogenous Sf-9 and overexpressed Gβ1. Activation of PLCβ by Wild Type and Mutated Gβγ Subunits—To demonstrate a functional role for the amino-terminal amino acids of Gβγ in mammalian PLCβ2 regulation, the purified mutated dimers were tested for activation of PLCβ2. Surprisingly, Gβ1(23–27)γ2 activated PLCβ2 2–4-fold more effectively than wild type with no significant change in the EC50 (Fig. 3A and Table I). There was no significant difference in either the -fold activation or the EC50 for activation by Gβ1(17–21) (Fig. 3A and Table I). Activation of PLCβ2 was abolished by boiling the mutant prior to performing the assay, indicating that the enhancement was not due to a non-protein contaminant within the buffer (data not shown). The addition of GDP-loaded Gαi blocked activation of PLCβ2 by Gβ1(23–27)γ2, ensuring that the enhancement was due to the addition of Gβγ and not a contaminating protein (Fig. 3B). The addition of purified PLC was required to observe accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, indicating that no endogenous Sf-9 phospholipases were co-purified with the mutant Gβγ (data not shown). These results were repeated with three different preparations of Gβ1(23–27)γ2 and two different preparations of wild type Gβ1γ2, demonstrating the reproducibility of the results with different batches of protein. As a final confirmation that both proteins were properly folded and functional postpurification, the ability of both Gβ1γ2 and Gβ1(23–27)γ2 to support pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of Gαi was tested. Both proteins supported ADP-ribosylation of Gαi with no significant difference in either potency or efficacy (Fig. 3C). These data confirm that both proteins are properly folded and functional and that there are no errors in the protein concentrations.Table IKinetic parameters of PLCβ2 activation by N-terminally mutated GβγsPLCβ2 activationaAverage ± S.D. of three (Gβ1(17-21)γ2) or six (Gβ1(23-27)γ2) independent experiments.N20K inhibition of PLCβ2 activationbAverage ± S.D. of three independent experiments.PLCβ3 activationbAverage ± S.D. of three independent experiments.EC50Maximal activationIC50Maximal inhibitionEC50Maximal activationnm-fold basalμm%μm-fold basalWT56 ± 5.86.4 ± 0.0618 ± 0.0585 ± 3.037 ± 9.58.1 ± 2.2Gβ1(17-21)γ250 ± 8.56.3 ± 0.5627 ± 0.04cSignificantly different as compared with wild type (p < 0.05).77 ± 3.8NDdND, not determined.NDGβ1(23-27)γ268 ± 1417 ± 2.2cSignificantly different as compared with wild type (p < 0.05).20 ± 0.0853 ± 3.7cSignificantly different as compared with wild type (p < 0.05).15 ± 1.7cSignificantly different as compared with wild type (p < 0.05).9.6 ± 3.5a Average ± S.D. of three (Gβ1(17-21)γ2) or six (Gβ1(23-27)γ2) independent experiments.b Average ± S.D. of three independent experiments.c Significantly different as compared with wild type (p < 0.05).d ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To determine whether this enhancement of activity was specific for PLCβ2, activation of PLCβ3 by mutant and wild type Gβγ was tested. In this case, both WT and Gβ1(23–27)γ2 activated PLCβ3 to a similar extent, but β1(23–27)γ2 was nearly 2-fold more potent than wild type (Fig. 3D and Table I). These data strongly support a function of the amino terminus in the regulation of both PLCβ2 and PLCβ3. In both cases, the role of the amino terminus appears to be inhibitory, although the mechanisms are different. Others have reported differential activation of PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 by Gβγ subunits (10Li Y.

Interaction between N20K and Mutated βγ Dimers—The amino acids chosen for mutation were amino acids that, due to their close proximity to Cys25, were likely candidates to directly interact with the N20K peptide. To determine whether the Gβ subunit mutations eliminated N20K peptide binding, we tested whether N20K could still cross-link to the amino-terminal mutants. Gβ1(17–21)γ2 did cross-link to N20K, although higher concentrations of peptide were required for cross-linking compared with wild type, whereas Gβ1(23–27)γ2 substantially lost its ability to cross-link to N20K (Fig. 4A). Normally, N20K cross-linking to Gβγ generates two higher molecular weight bands. N20K cross-linking to Gβ1(23–27)γ2 produces only one faint higher molecular weight band. We predicted that if the functional effects of N20K on activation of PLCβ by Gβγ subunits were through binding at the amino terminus, then elimination of this binding site would eliminate N20K inhibition of Gβγ-dependent activation of PLCβ2. Unexpectedly, N20K still inhibited Gβ1(23–27)γ2 activation of PLCβ2 with a similar potency as wild type. Gβ1(23–27)γ2-dependent activation of PLC was inhibited by 50%, whereas wild type Gβγ-dependent activation was inhibited 85%. The inability of N20K to fully inhibit PLC activation by Gβ1(23–27)γ2 may be due to the increased efficacy of Gβ1(23–27)γ2. Taken together, the cross-linking data and the peptide inhibition data suggest that there may be two binding sites for N20K on Gβγ, one within the amino terminus of Gβγ eliminated by the Gβ1(23–27)γ2 mutation and one remaining intact. The ability of N20K to inhibit Gβ1(23–27)γ2 activation of PLC would be through binding to this second site. From these experiments, we hypothesize that Y-domain binding to the amino terminus of Gβγ inhibits PLC activity, whereas Y-domain binding to this second site increases PLC activity. Defining a Second Site for N20K Interaction—Cross-linking data presented here and in our previous publications support the notion of two N20K binding sites. Cross-linking of N20K to Gβγ produces two higher molecular weight bands (Figs. 1B and 4A). The first higher molecular weight band is Gβ cross-linked to one N20K peptide. The nature of the second band had been unclear, but its appearance was prevented by preincubation with purified PLCβ or mutation of Tyr15 to Gln in the peptide (13Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that it was not nonspecific. Moreover, replacement of Cys25 with alanine still produced one faint higher molecular weight band (15Yoshikawa D.M. Bresciano K. Hatwar M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11246-11251Abstrac"
https://openalex.org/W2021934092,"We previously showed that a fraction of the acetyls used to synthesize malonyl-CoA in rat heart derives from partial peroxisomal oxidation of very long and long-chain fatty acids. The 13C labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl moiety of citrate) was >1.0 with 13C-fatty acids, which yields [13C]acetyl-CoA in both mitochondria and peroxisomes and < 1.0 with substrates, which yields [13C]acetyl-CoA only in mitochondria. In this study, we tested the influence of 13C-fatty acid concentration and chain length on the labeling of acetyl-CoA formed in mitochondria and/or peroxisomes. Hearts were perfused with increasing concentrations of labeled docosanoate, oleate, octanoate, hexanoate, butyrate, acetate, or dodecanedioate. In contrast to the liver, peroxisomal oxidation of 1-13C-fatty acids in heart does not form [1-13C]acetate. With [1-13C]docosanoate and [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate, malonyl-CoA enrichment plateaued at 11 and 9%, respectively, with no detectable labeling of the acetyl moiety of citrate. Thus, in the intact rat heart, docosanoate and dodecanedioate appear to be oxidized only in peroxisomes. With [1-13C]oleate or [1-13C]octanoate, the labeling ratio >1 indicates the partial peroxisomal oxidation of oleate and octanoate. In contrast, with [3-13C]octanoate, [1-13C]hexanoate, [1-13C]butyrate, or [1,2-13C2]acetate, the labeling ratio was <0.7 at all concentrations. Therefore, in rat heart, (i) n-fatty acids shorter than 8 carbons do not undergo peroxisomal oxidation, (ii) octanoate undergoes only one cycle of peroxisomal β-oxidation, (iii) there is no detectable transfer to the mitochondria of acetyl-CoA from the cytosol or the peroxisomes, and (iv) the capacity of C2–C18 fatty acids to generate mitochondrial acetyl-CoA decreases with chain length. We previously showed that a fraction of the acetyls used to synthesize malonyl-CoA in rat heart derives from partial peroxisomal oxidation of very long and long-chain fatty acids. The 13C labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl moiety of citrate) was >1.0 with 13C-fatty acids, which yields [13C]acetyl-CoA in both mitochondria and peroxisomes and < 1.0 with substrates, which yields [13C]acetyl-CoA only in mitochondria.

Malonyl-CoA plays an important role in the regulation of fuel selection by the heart through its potent inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I and of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (1Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA is synthesized by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2, which appears to be attached to the outer membrane of mitochondria facing the cytosol (2Ha J. Lee J.K. Kim K.S. Witters L.A. Kim K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11466-11470Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 184SCrossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because the heart is a non-lipogenic organ, the only known fate of malonyl-CoA is its decarboxylation by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Thus acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase catalyze an acetyl-CoA → malonyl-CoA → acetyl-CoA substrate cycle that regulates malonyl-CoA concentration and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in the heart has been extensively investigated. For recent reviews, see Refs. 4Sambandam N. Steinmetz M. Chu A. Altarejos J.Y.

Because the cytosolic concentrations of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are much lower than the Km of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase for their corresponding substrates, the concentrations of these substrates may regulate the fluxes through the enzymes. We recently measured the turnover of malonyl-CoA in isolated rat hearts perfused with NaH13CO3 (9Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Thomas K.R. Jobbins K.A. Cheng J.F. Lopaschuk G.D. Dyck J.R. Diaz M.

Under conditions where the malonyl-CoA concentration varied over a 5-fold range, this concentration was directly proportional to the acetyl-CoA carboxylase flux, but the total activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (measured in tissue extracts) did not vary. This strongly supports the notion that in the heart the cytosolic concentration of acetyl-CoA is a major determinant of the concentration of malonyl-CoA and of the rate of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The acetyl-CoA used by cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase is believed to be transferred from mitochondria either via acetylcarnitine or citrate and ATP-citrate lyase. We recently showed that a fraction of this acetyl-CoA is derived from the partial peroxisomal oxidation of long-chain or very long-chain fatty acids (10Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Jobbins K.A.

This conclusion was based from the comparison of the 13C labeling of malonyl-CoA and the acetyl moiety of citrate, a proxy for mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. The labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl moiety of citrate) was smaller than 1.0 in the presence of substrates that yield labeled acetyl-CoA only in mitochondria ([16-13C]palmitate, [U-13C6]glucose, [3-13C]lactate + [3-13C]pyruvate). In contrast, the labeling ratio was greater than 1.0 in the presence of fatty acids that yield labeled acetyl-CoA both in mitochondria and peroxisomes ([1,2-13C2]palmitate, [1-13C]oleate, and [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate). This demonstrated that a fraction of the acetyl-CoA used for malonyl-CoA synthesis is formed in the extramitochondrial space, most likely in peroxisomes, probably via the straight-chain fatty acid β-oxidation system (11Baes M. Huyghe S. Carmeliet P. Declercq P.E. Collen D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16329-16336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The present study takes advantage of the isotopic techniques we developed to further investigate various aspects of the regulation of peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation specifically (i) the relative affinity of the two processes for low fatty acid concentrations, (ii) whether acetyl-CoA derived from peroxisomal oxidation is released as acetate, (iii) the effect of fatty acid chain length on peroxisomal oxidation, (iv) whether dodecanedioate is oxidized in mitochondria of the intact heart, and (v) the relative capacity of fatty acids of different chain length to generate mitochondrial acetyl-CoA.

Hearts were perfused in the Langendorf mode (12 ml/min) with non-recirculating bicarbonate buffer containing 3% dialyzed bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free, Intergen), 4 mm glucose, 1 mm lactate, 0.2 mm pyruvate, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 8 nm insulin, and 50 μm l-carnitine. For experiments with fatty acids of 8 or fewer carbons (which could be added to the perfusate as an aqueous solution of sodium salt via a syringe pump), the hearts were first perfused for 15 min with various concentrations of acetate, butyrate, hexanoate or octanoate, before switching to [1,2-13C2]acetate, [1-13C]butyrate, [1-13C]hexanoate, [1-13C]octanoate, or [3-13C]octanoate. The hearts were quick-frozen 30 min after label addition. For experiments with [1-13C]oleate (0–0.8 mm), [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate (0–0.8 mm), or [1-13C]docosanoate (0–0.1 mm), there was no pre-equilibration with unlabeled acid. The hearts were quick-frozen 40 min after label addition. Because of the poor solubility of docosanoate, the maximum concentration achievable in the 3% albuminated perfusate was 0.1 mm. Analytical Procedures—The 13C labeling of malonyl-CoA was assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described previously (12Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. Comte B. Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), except that (i) we isolated the short-chain CoA esters on an Oasis cartridge (Waters), and (ii) malonate was assayed as the t-butyldimethylsilyl derivative (monitoring m/z 333–336). For the assay of the malonyl-CoA concentration, samples of frozen tissues were spiked with an internal standard of [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA before extraction. The 13C labeling of the acetyl moiety of heart citrate (a probe of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA) was assayed by cleaving citrate with ATP-citrate lyase isolated from rat liver (15Linn T.C. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1691-1698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzing acetyl-CoA by ion trap liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (10Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F.

Because of the poor solubility of [1-13C]docosanoate, its perfusate concentration was assayed (as the trimethylsilyl derivative) using a standard curve built with unlabeled docosanoate and an internal standard of [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate. In some experiments, the 13C labeling of acetate in the effluent perfusate (16Powers L. Osborn M.K. Kien C.L. Murray R.D. Brunengraber H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 30: 747-754Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) of tissue succinyl-CoA (17Kasumov T. Martini W.Z. Reszko A.E. Bian F. Pierce B.A. David F. Roe C.R. Brunengraber H. Anal.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19574-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were assayed as described previously. Data Presentations and Statistics—We present data from ∼60 heart perfusion experiments. For each of the experimental conditions chosen (see Fig. 6), we ran 5–10 perfusions in the presence of selected 13C-labeled substrate(s) with the concentration parameters being allowed to vary. Data shown in the figures are the M1 and M2 13C enrichments of tissue malonyl-CoA, acetyl moiety of citrate, and acetylcarnitine measured in a given heart perfusion. They represent means of duplicate gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry injections, respectively, which differed by <2%. The statistical significance of differences between the 13C enrichments of malonyl-CoA and the acetyl moiety of citrate in each set of experiments was tested using a paired t test (Graph Pad Prism Software, version 3). To probe peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, we perfused rat hearts with a number of 13C-labeled fatty acids at different concentrations and measured the enrichment of malonyl-CoA (a probe of extramitochondrial acetyl-CoA) and of the acetyl moiety of citrate (a probe of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA) (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). When the enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate was measurable, we calculated the 13C labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl moiety of citrate) (see Fig. 6). The fatty acids investigated range from those believed to be oxidized only in peroxisomes (dodecanedioate and docosanoate) to those believed to be oxidized only in mitochondria (hexanoate, butyrate, and acetate).Fig. 2Labeling profiles of malonyl-CoA, acetyl moiety of citrate, and acetyl carnitine as a function of the concentration of [1-13C]docosanoate in the perfusate.MPE, molar percent enrichment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Labeling profiles of malonyl-CoA and acetyl moiety of citrate as a function of the concentration of [1-13C]oleate in the perfusate.

To confirm this absence, we assayed the labeling of citrate and succinyl-CoA; these intermediates of the citric acid cycle should be labeled from mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. Citrate was assayed as its trimethyl derivative to minimize its natural enrichment (10%). Consistent with the data for the acetyl moiety of citrate, there was no detectable labeling in citrate or succinyl-CoA. Note that these hearts were perfused without competing fatty acids, which might have decreased any contribution of [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. Thus, it appears that dodecanedioate, or acetyl groups derived from its extramitochondrial degradation, was not oxidized in the mitochondria of the intact heart. However, one cannot exclude a very small and undetectable contribution, i.e. <1%, of dodecanedioate to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. Vamecq and Draye (19Vamecq J. Draye J.P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that isolated heart mitochondria can oxidize 0.08 mm dodecanedioyl-CoA in the presence of 0.35 mm carnitine. The oxidation of dodecanedioyl-CoA was reflected by the reduction of ferricyanide. It is not clear whether the observations of Vamecq and Draye (19Vamecq J. Draye J.P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reflect (i) a very low rate of mitochondrial oxidation, which would be undetectable in the intact heart or (ii) the presence of peroxisomes in their mitochondrial preparation. Indeed, in intact liver cells, there is good evidence that dodecanedioate is oxidized only in peroxisomes (19Vamecq J. Draye J.P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Suzuki H. Yamada J. Watanabe T. Suga T. Biochim. Biophys.

Kunnecke B. Dolle A. Seelig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11664-11674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) infused [1,12-13C2]-dodecanedioate intravenously to rats. Using 13C NMR spectroscopy of the liver, they identified [1-13C]adipate but could not find any labeling in the citric acid cycle intermediates or ketone bodies. In the same hearts perfused with 0–0.8 mm [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate, the enrichment of malonyl-CoA plateaued at 9% (Fig. 1). The labeling of malonyl-CoA in the absence of a detectable label in mitochondrial acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1) can only be explained by the peroxisomal oxidation of [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate, followed by the transfer of labeled acetyl groups to the cytosol. It is not clear how this transfer occurs in the heart. In the liver, part of the acetyl groups derived from peroxisomal oxidation are released as free acetate. We assayed the concentration and labeling of acetate in the effluent perfusate. Only minute traces of unlabeled acetate were detected. Thus, peroxisomal oxidation of dodecanedioate in the heart is not accompanied by the release of acetate. Also, we did not find any detectable label in tissue acetylcarnitine (Fig. 1). Our data argue against the transport of acetyl groups out of heart peroxisomes via acetylcarnitine. There are conflicting data on the involvement of a carnitine acetyltransferase in the transfer of acetyl groups from peroxisomes to the cytosol. Although Connock and Perry (24Connock M.J. Perry S.R. Biochem. Int. 1983; 6: 545-551PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a small fraction of the carnitine acetyltransferase of mouse heart is peroxisomal, Abbas et al. (25Abbas A.S. Wu G. Schulz H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1305-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported the absence of cytosolic carnitine acetyltransferase in the extramitochondrial space of rat heart. In a recent review, Ramsay and Zammit (26Ramsay R.R. Zammit V.A. Mol. Aspects Med. 2004; 25: 475-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) evoked the possibility that acyl-CoAs might cross the peroxisomal membrane without transient formation of acylcarnitine. Therefore, the mechanism of the transfer of peroxisomal acetyl-CoA to the cytosol needs to be further studied. Can our data shed light on the number of cycles of oxidation undergone by [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate in heart peroxisomes? The maximal number of such cycles is four, which would generate [13C]succinyl-CoA. Because the tissue succinyl-CoA was unlabeled, it is unlikely that [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate went through the maximal number of four peroxisomal oxidation cycles. If [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate went through 1, 2, or 3 cycles of oxidation, the initial enrichment of the acetyl-CoA produced would be 100, 50, or 33%, respectively. This initial enrichment is decreased by two processes, (i) unlabeled acetyl-CoA transferred from mitochondria and (ii) unlabeled acetyl-CoA formed in peroxisomes from the oxidation of unlabeled, endogenous fatty acids (10Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Jobbins K.A. Thomas K.R. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19574-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The data of our experiment do not allow us to assess these dilution factors. However, we can conclude that at least 9% of the acetyl-CoA used for malonyl-CoA synthesis was derived from the peroxisomal oxidation of 0.8 mm [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate. Although our data do not yield rates of [1,12-13C2]dodecanedioate oxidation in heart peroxisomes, Fig. 1 shows that this oxidation reaches half of its maximal value at ∼0.1 mm of substrate. Experiments with Docosanoate (22:0)—Because of the poor solubility of docosanoate, even in the presence of 3% bovine serum albumin, we assayed the concentration of [1-13C]docosanoate in the inflowing perfusate (see “Experimental Procedures”). In hearts perfused with 0–0.1 mm [1-13C]docosanoate (Fig. 2), the enrichment of malonyl-CoA plateaued at 11%, but the enrichments of the acetyl moiety of citrate and of citrate were undetectable in all cases. This indicated the absence of labeling of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. In previous experiments with 0.1 mm [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate (10Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Jobbins K.A. Thomas K.R. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19574-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate was 3–4%, while the enrichment of malonyl-CoA was 40%. The data from the two labeled forms of docosanoate yield complementary information. First, docosanoyl-CoA does not enter the mitochondria of the intact heart. Second, it appears that after one cycle of peroxisomal oxidation, [1,2-13C2]eicosanoyl-CoA (20:0) derived from [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoyl-CoA can to some extent enter mitochondria and be oxidized to [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA. Third, the higher enrichment of malonyl-CoA from [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate compared with [1-13C]docosanoate shows that [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate went through at least two cycles of peroxisomal oxidation, but part of the product of the first cycle, i.e. [1,2-13C2]eicosanoyl-CoA, was transferred to mitochondria. An alternate explanation would be the transfer of [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA from peroxisomes to mitochondria via e.g. acetylcarnitine. Arguing against this possibility are (i) the absence of labeling of the acetyl moiety of citrate and (ii) the absence of detectable label in tissue acetylcarnitine (Fig. 2) in the presence of [1-13C]docosanoate. Furthermore, the absence of detectable labeling of the acetyl moiety of citrate while malonyl-CoA, and thus cytosolic acetyl-CoA, was 11% labeled (Fig. 2) argues against a substantial transport of cytosolic acetyl-CoA to mitochondria in the heart. The perfused rat liver oxidizes docosanoate only through peroxisomes and releases acetate in the medium (14Zhang Y. Agarwal K.C. Beylot M. Soloviev M.V. David F. Reider M.W. Anderson V.E. Tserng K.Y. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11025-11029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assayed the concentration and labeling of acetate in the effluent perfusate. No labeling of acetate was detected. Thus, in contrast to what occurs in the liver, peroxisomal oxidation of docosanoate in the heart is not accompanied by the release of acetate. Our data show that the peroxisomal oxidation of docosanoate is a high affinity process because, at a concentration of [1-13C]docosanoate of 0.02 mm, the malonyl-CoA enrichment was half of its maximum value (Fig. 2). Experiments with Oleate—In the presence of [1-13C]oleate, the enrichment of malonyl-CoA rose sharply and linearly (r2 = 0.98) between 0 and 0.2 mm [1-13C]oleate, then plateaued at ∼12% at [1-13C]oleate concentrations equal or greater than 0.2 mm (Fig. 3). The enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate increased progressively with the [1-13C]oleate concentration but remained lower than the enrichment of malonyl-CoA. Thus, in all cases, the labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl moiety of citrate) was >1.5, especially at a low [1-13C]oleate concentration (Fig. 6). This high labeling ratio shows that (i) oleate is oxidized in both peroxisomes and mitochondria, and (ii) the peroxisomal oxidation of oleate is a high affinity process compared with mitochondrial oxidation. However, mitochondrial oxidation of oleate is a high capacity process as indicated by the contribution of oleate to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA (∼80% at 0.8 mm [1-13C]oleate, see Fig. 8A). Peroxisomal oxidation of oleate is a low capacity process based on the reported activities of the enzymes involved, in particular acyl-CoA oxidase (27Vanhove G.F. Van Veldhoven P.P. Fransen M. Denis S. Eyssen H.J. Wanders R.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10335-10344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with Medium- and Short-chain Fatty Acids— Rat liver peroxisomes have a high capacity to oxidize octanoyl-CoA (28Skorin C. Necochea C. Johow V. Soto U. Grau A.M. Bremer J. Leighton F. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Hryb D.J. Hogg J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 2002; 363: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We reported that, in livers perfused with non-recirculating perfusate containing [1-13C]octanoate, the enrichment of effluent acetate was 37%; that is greater than the highest possible value for mitochondrial acetyl-CoA (25%). It also was up to twice that of ketone bodies (14Zhang Y. Agarwal K.C. Beylot M. Soloviev M.V. David F. Reider M.W. Anderson V.E. Tserng K.Y. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11025-11029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that, in liver, octanoate undergoes at least one cycle of peroxisomal β-oxidation and that the first acetyl of octanoate is released, at least in part, as free acetate (14Zhang Y. Agarwal K.C. Beylot M. Soloviev M.V. David F. Reider M.W. Anderson V.E. Tserng K.Y. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11025-11029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, acyl-CoA oxidase of human liver peroxisomes has high activity for the CoA esters of octanoate, dodecanoate, and palmitate (27Vanhove G.F. Van Veldhoven P.P. Fransen M. Denis S. Eyssen H.J. Wanders R.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10335-10344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We could not find any reference on the peroxisomal oxidation of octanoate in the intact heart. We only found reports that octanoyl-CoA is oxidized either by a medium-chain oxidase in isolated peroxisomes from rat hearts (31Kvannes J. Eikhom T.S. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or by a fatty acyl-CoA oxidase in rat heart homogenates (32Harrison E.H. Walusimbi-Kisitu M. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H441-H445PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the peroxisomes of the intact heart can oxidize octanoate, we perfused hearts with increasing concentrations of [1-13C]octanoate (Fig. 4). At low [1-13C]octanoate concentrations, the enrichment of malonyl-CoA was up to four times that of the acetyl moiety of citrate. The two enrichments became similar (22–25%) at high [1-13C]octanoate concentrations (Figs. 4 and 6). This indicates that, in the heart, [1-13C]octanoate is oxidized in peroxisomes forming highly enriched [1-13C]acetyl-CoA, which is used for malonyl-CoA synthesis. To test whether octanoate can undergo more than one cycle of peroxisomal oxidation, we perfused hearts with [3-13C]-octanoate (Fig. 5). We found that the enrichment of acetyl moiety of citrate plateaued at 21%, which is almost identical to that of [1-13C]octanoate perfused hearts (22%). However, the enrichment of malonyl-CoA plateaued at 13%, which is half of that of [1-13C]octanoate (25%). Thus, the relative profiles of enrichment from [3-13C]octanoate of malonyl-CoA and the acetyl moiety of citrate (Fig. 5) were markedly different from those obtained with [1-13C]octanoate (Fig. 4). At all [3-13C]octanoate concentrations, the enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate was greater than that of malonyl-CoA, and the labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl of citrate) ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 (Fig. 6). This clearly shows that the second acetyl group of octanoate is not converted to acetyl-CoA in peroxisomes. As an additional control, we perfused hearts with [1-13C]hexanoate, and the labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl of citrate) ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 (Fig. 6), as was the case for [3-13C]octanoate. Lastly, we perfused hearts with increasing concentrations of [1-13C]butyrate or [1,2-13C2]acetate. These fatty acids are only oxidized in mitochondria. Again, the labeling ratio (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl of citrate) ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 (Fig. 6). Whether or not the heart has a cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase is not entirely clear from the old literature. Recently, Fujino et al. (33Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) reported that most of heart acetyl-CoA synthetase activity (AceCS2) is mitochondrial, with a very small fraction of the activity in the cytosol (AceCS1) (see Fig. 4 of Ref. 33Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This is an important question in relation to malonyl-CoA metabolism, because a cytosolic synthetase could convert plasma acetate to acetyl-CoA used for malonyl-CoA synthesis. Our data argue against a cytosolic activation of acetate because, in the presence of [U-13C2]acetate (this study, Fig. 6) or [U-13C6]glucose (Table I of Ref. 10Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Jobbins K.A. Thomas K.R. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19574-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the enrichment of malonyl-CoA was about 40% that of the acetyl moiety of citrate (Fig. 6). Labeling of extramitochondrial acetyl-CoA from [U-13C6]-glucose can only occur via export of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. Thus, the similar dilutions (malonyl-CoA)/(acetyl of citrate) with [U-13C2]acetate and [U-13C6]glucose show that no substantial activation of acetate occurs in heart cytosol. In summary, (i) octanoate undergoes one cycle of peroxisomal oxidation in the heart, and (ii) hexanoate and short-chain fatty acids are oxidized only in mitochondria. In all experiments described above, only minute traces of acetate (<0.03 mm) were assayed without any detectable enrichment. This contrasts with the release of labeled acetate from (i) rat liver peroxisomes incubated with [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (34Hovik R. Brodal B. Bartlett K. Osmundsen H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 993-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) rat hepatocytes incubated with [1-14C]dodecanedioate (35Leighton F. Bergseth S. Rortveit T. Christiansen E.N. Bremer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10347-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or [1-14C]octanoate, and (iii) rat livers perfused with [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate and [1-13C]octanoate (14Zhang Y. Agarwal K.C. Beylot M. Soloviev M.V. David F. Reider M.W. Anderson V.E. Tserng K.Y. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11025-11029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike the situation in liver (34Hovik R. Brodal B. Bartlett K. Osmundsen H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 993-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Leighton F. Bergseth S. Rortveit T. Christiansen E.N. Bremer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10347-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), peroxisomal oxidation in rat heart is not accompanied by the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA and release of acetate. We extensively reviewed this matter in the literature, especially the papers by Alexson and co-workers (36Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) who characterized acetyl-CoA thioesterase in liver peroxisomes, but we could not find any reference to acetyl-CoA thioesterase in heart peroxisomes. Malonyl-CoA concentration increased linearly (r2 = 0.95) in hearts perfused with [1-13C] and [3-13C]octanoate (Fig. 7). This increase presumably inhibited the oxidation of endogenous, unlabeled long-chain fatty acids. No such correlation between tissue malonyl-CoA concentration and perfusate fatty acid concentration was observed with the other fatty acids (not shown). Our data are in agreement with results that malonyl-CoA concentration is higher in hearts perfused with octanoate than in hearts perfused with palmitate or oleate (37Longnus S.L. Wambolt R.B. Barr R.L. Lopaschuk G.D. Allard M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1561-H1567PubMed Google Scholar, 38Poirier M. Vincent G. Reszko A.E. Bouchard B. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. Am. J.

Contribution of Fatty Acids of Various Chain Lengths to Mitochondrial Acetyl-CoA—The data from the experiments with the fatty acids that label the acetyl moiety of citrate allow one to calculate the contribution of these fatty acids to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA and thus to energy production by the heart. The contribution to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA of a fatty acid labeled in one of its acetyl moieties is calculated by multiplying the enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate by the number of acetyl groups in the fatty acid molecule (Fig. 8A). The contributions of C2–C18 fatty acids to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, plotted as a function of the fatty acid millimolar concentrations, are remarkably similar (Fig. 8A). These contributions plateau at 80–90% for fatty acid concentrations of 0.8 mm. Our data are in agreement with reports that fatty acids contribute 60–90% to energy production in the normal heart (39Lopaschuk G.D. Saddik M. Mol.

The data in Fig. 8A can be replotted with the concentration of inflowing fatty acids expressed as millimolar acetyl units (Fig. 8B). Then, for similar supplies of acetyl units, the efficiency of fatty acids as precursors of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA varies inversely with their chain length. For example, 1 mm acetyl from acetate or oleate contributes 82 or 24%, respectively, to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. This ranking is observed also within the group of fatty acids that do not use the carnitine acyl transferase system to enter mitochondria (C2–C8). This is quite surprising if one considers the energetics of the formation of acetyl-CoA from the various fatty acids. Fig. 9 shows the calculated average ATP yield or cost of converting one acetyl group of the various fatty acids to acetyl-CoA. These were calculated from the stoichiometry of all reactions involved from the activation of the fatty acid, to the production of ATP from the oxidation of FADH2 and NADH (44Voet D. Voet J.G. Pratt C.W. Fundamentals of Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 569-571Google Scholar). This yield decreases with the fatty acid chain length. Although making mitochondrial acetyl-CoA from oleate yields on average 4 mol of ATP/mol of acetyl-CoA, making acetyl-CoA from acetate costs 2 mol of ATP/mol of acetyl-CoA. Thus, the oxidation to CO2 of one mol of acetyl derived from acetate or oleate yields 14 or 20 mol of ATP, respectively. The high contribution to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA of low energy yielding acetate is puzzling. Therefore, the mechanism of the ranking of fatty acids as precursors of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA deserves further investigation. In summary, the peroxisomal oxidation of n-fatty acids with 8 or more carbons (and of dodecanedioate) in the intact heart is a high affinity, low capacity process, which is not accompanied by the production of free acetate. The efficiency of the contribution of C2–C18 fatty acids to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, and thus to energy production of the heart, decreases with the fatty acid chain length. Our data also demonstrate that (i) octanoate undergoes only one cycle of peroxisomal β-oxidation, (ii) dodecanedioate and docosanoate are oxidized only in peroxisomes, and (iii) there is no detectable transfer to the mitochondria of acetyl-CoA from the cytosol or the peroxisomes. The latter two conclusions will be revisited using high sensitivity techniques such as gas chromatography-pyrolysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry."

Folate is a B vitamin that plays important roles in cellular growth and division.

In eukaryotes folate metabolism is separated into two compartments, the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Some enzymes, such as serine hydroxymethyltransferase, are found in both compartments, usually encoded by separate nuclear genes (1Garrow T.A. Brenner A.A. Whitehead V.M. Chen X.N. Duncan R.G. Korenburg J.R. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11910-11916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, trifunctional methyleneTHF dehydrogenase-methenylTHF cyclohydrolase-formylTHF synthetases (DCS) are found in both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments (2Staben C. Rabinowitz J.C.

Chem. 1988; 263: 7717-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 13C tracer studies in yeast have demonstrated that one-carbon units from serine flow through the mitochondria to the cytoplasm through the action of the mitochondrial DCS (4Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8713-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The one-carbon units exit the mitochondria as formate, produced by the reversal of the 10-formylTHF synthetase activity. The formate is then used by the cytoplasmic DCS, which converts it into 10-formylTHF for use in purine synthesis and other biosynthetic reactions.The cytoplasmic DCS has been identified and cloned in several organisms (2Staben C. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4629-4637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rong Y.S. Golic K.G. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1551-1566PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hum D.W. Bell A.W.

Biophys. 2002; 403: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The genes encode a single polypeptide possessing the three DCS activities. The 100-kDa monomer dimerizes to form the active enzyme. However, until recently the only mitochondrial homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial DCS to be identified in mammals was the NAD-dependent methyleneTHF dehydrogenase-methenylTHF cyclohydrolase (NMDMC) (9Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14616-14620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic studies of transformed fibroblasts derived from murine NMDMC knockouts revealed that they are glycine auxotrophs (10Patel H. Di Pietro E. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19436-19441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The glycine auxotrophy is most likely because of the formation of a type of folate trap; the available THF in the mitochondria is trapped as methyleneTHF. Moreover, the glycine auxotrophy indicates that NMDMC is the only mitochondrial methyleneTHF dehydrogenase expressed in transformed cells. These studies also supported the concept that mammalian mitochondria generate formate to supply the cytoplasmic DCS with one-carbon units during periods of rapid growth, such as embryogenesis. It was suggested that a yet to be identified 10-formylTHF hydrolase or a monofunctional 10-formylTHF synthetase might provide the missing link between the 10-formylTHF produced by NMDMC and the formate released to the cytoplasm.Barlowe and Appling (11Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar) reported the detection of all three of the DCS activities in purified adult rat liver mitochondria preparations. However, because NMDMC null cell lines appear not to express another mitochondrial methyleneTHF dehydrogenase, it is unlikely that a trifunctional DCS is expressed in the mitochondria of transformed and ES cell lines. The detection of the DCS activities in mitochondrial preparations is complicated by contamination by the high activities of the cytosolic protein. To determine whether either of the dehydrogenase or synthetase activities exist in the mitochondria of immortalized cell lines we undertook to inactivate the cytoplasmic DCS gene.Here we report the production of DCS null cell lines that we used to detect mitochondrial synthetase activity. We propose that the detected activity is due to a recently identified mitochondrial DCS protein in which the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities have been inactivated, resulting in a monofunctional synthetase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESKnock-out of DCS in Embryonic Stem Cells—The gene and cDNA for DCS were isolated as described previously (8Patel H. Christensen K.E. Mejia N. MacKenzie R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 403: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession numbers AF364580 to AF364592) 2GenBank™ accession numbers: AF364580, AF364581, AF364582, AF364583, AF364584, AF364585, AF364586, AF364587, AF364588, AF364589, AF364590, AF364591, AF364592.. The targeting vector used for homologous recombination is shown in Fig. 1. The vector is designed to insert the cDNA of DCS into the first exon of the nuclear gene; a rabbit β-globin intron 2/SV40 polyadenylation signal cassette obtained from the pSG5 vector (Stratagene) was attached to the cDNA to provide processing signals. The 5′ arm is a 1.5-kb HindIII NcoI fragment containing exon 1 up to the start codon, and the 3′ arm is a 2.3-kb SacI fragment containing exon 2. The arms and cDNA were inserted into the pMC1neopA vector (Stratagene) to which a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase cassette had been added. To knock out the gene encoding DCS with this vector the first 106 nucleotides of the coding sequence were removed, altering the reading frame of the remaining sequence. The cDNA also contained a K386E mutation that abrogates synthetase function (data not shown). Generation of heterozygous and homozygous embryonic stem cells was done as described previously (12Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Clones were screened by Southern blot (12Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); HindIII digested genomic DNA was probed with a 1.65-kb HindIII PstI fragment containing exon 1 and a 1.5-kb PstI HindIII fragment of intron 2 as shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Genotyping of ES cell lines by Southern blot.

Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The E11.5 chimeric embryos were used to generate primary embryonic fibroblast cell lines as described previously (10Patel H. Di Pietro E. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19436-19441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Disrupted embryos were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1× non-essential amino acids, 1× glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin (all Invitrogen), 30 μm thymidine, and 30 μm hypoxanthine (both Sigma) with 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen) to select for null mutant cells. All cell lines described in this work were routinely cultured in this medium, unless otherwise noted. The embryonic fibroblasts were spontaneously immortalized by continuous passage in culture.Purine Auxotrophy of Null Mutant Fibroblasts—Cells lacking the cytoplasmic DCS cannot produce the 10-formylTHF required for the synthesis of purines from either formate or methyleneTHF. To functionally test the knock-out, the growth of the cells with and without supplementation by the purine hypoxanthine was evaluated. SF6 (–/–) and IF22 (+/+) cells were cultured in the medium described above with the addition of 1× ITS-S (insulin, transferrin, sodium selenite, and ethanolamine, from Sigma) and the substitution of 15% redialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) with or without hypoxanthine as required. The fetal bovine serum was redialyzed, and the cells were adapted to it as described by Patel et al. (10Patel H. Di Pietro E. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19436-19441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in medium containing hypoxanthine. After 24 h the medium was changed to the medium required for the experiment. Cells were counted in triplicate at 24-h intervals by the trypan blue exclusion method.Cell Culture and Enzyme Assays—For assay of enzyme activities in whole cell extracts, the immortalized wild type and null fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 5× T175 flasks, harvested by trypsinization, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet, about 300 mg of packed cells, was stored at –85 °C. For the isolation of purified mitochondria, SF6 cells (immortalized null fibroblasts) were grown to confluence in 26 × 15-cm tissue culture plates. The cells were harvested and the mitochondria isolated as described in Ruffolo et al. (13Ruffolo S.C. Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Goping I.S. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. Li H. Yuan J. Shore G.C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Approximately 0.15 g of mitochondria was obtained per gram of packed cells.To prepare extracts of either whole cells or mitochondria, the appropriate pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of sonication buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 35 mm β-mercaptoethanol, all Bioshop) per gram of pellet and sonicated on ice with 3 × 10-s pulses separated by 1 min of rest on ice. Glycerol (0.24× volume) was added to the sonicate, which was centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and kept at 4 °C until assayed.The dehydrogenase and synthetase activities of the extracts were determined using a multiple time point assay to ensure detection of small amounts of enzyme activity. The assay conditions are as described in Mejia and MacKenzie (9Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14616-14620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Tan et al. (14Tan L.U.L. Drury E.J. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1117-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following changes. All assay mixtures contained 144 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase assay mixture contained 630 μm NAD. NAD-dependent dehydrogenase assays were also done without magnesium to look for dehydrogenase activity not due to NMDMC. 10 mm EDTA was added to assays without magnesium to chelate any trace amounts found in the crude extracts. The protein content of the extracts was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar).Northern Blot Analysis of NMDMC and DCS Mutants—Total RNA was isolated from IF22 (+/+), IF74 (NMDMC (–/–)), and SF6 (DCS (–/–)) cell lines grown to confluence in a T175 flask using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. 20 μg of each RNA sample was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde gel in quadruplicate and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by vacuum transfer in 10× SSC for 2 h. The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane under ultraviolet light for 5 min. Each subset of membrane was probed with one of: full-length NMDMC cDNA (2-kb, GenBank™ accession number NM_008638), full-length DCS cDNA (3-kb, GenBank™ accession number AF364580), a 1.3-kb NcoI fragment of the clone 6311761 (GenBank™ accession number BQ917278), which codes for the 5′ end of the mtDCS, and a 1.7-kb PstI fragment of the clone 5374413 (GenBank™ accession number BC030437), which codes for the 3′ end of the mtDCS. Clones 6311761 and 5374413 were obtained from Open Biosystems. Each probe was labeled using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) and [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization, washing, and exposure of the blots were performed according to standard protocols.Multiple Sequence Alignment—A multiple sequence alignment was constructed using ClustalW 1.82 at the European Bioinformatics Institute web site (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw) (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55217) Google Scholar) using standard defaults and the entire sequence of each protein. The following protein sequences were used in the alignment: human mtDCS, human NMDMC, human DCS, mouse mtDCS, mouse NMDMC, mouse DCS, Drosophila NMDMC, Drosophila DCS, S. cerevisiae mitochondrial DCS, S. cerevisiae cytoplasmic DCS, and Escherichia coli DC (GenBank™ accession numbers: AY374130, NM_006636, NM_005956, NM_172308, NM_008638, AF364579, L07958, AF082097, J03724, M12878, M74789) 3GenBank™ accession numbers: AY374130, NM_006636, NM_005956, NM_172308, NM_008638, AF364579, L07958, AF082097, J03724, M12878, M74789..RESULTSDCS Null Fibroblasts—DCS heterozygous and null ES cells were established as described, and their genotypes were verified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Null ES cells were injected into blastocysts, and DCS null fibroblast cell lines were established from chimeras using high G418 medium to select against wild type cells. Fig. 3 shows that the DCS null cell lines are purine auxotrophs; they have no means of producing the 10-formylTHF required for purine synthesis in the cytoplasm from either serine or formate and are therefore dependent on exogenous sources of purines. This phenotype confirms the knock-out of the cytoplasmic methyleneTHF dehydrogenase and 10-formylTHF synthetase activities.Fig. 3Growth of wild type and null mutant fibroblasts with and without hypoxanthine supplementation.

The results of these assays are shown in Fig. 5 and Table I. The NAD-dependent dehydrogenase activity serves as a marker for the enrichment of mitochondrial proteins. Although there is significant synthetase activity, confirming the mitochondrial location of mtDCS, there is no detectable NADP-dependent dehydrogenase activity. To confirm that the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase activity observed is NMDMC, the assay was repeated without added magnesium and with EDTA added to the assay mix to chelate magnesium present in the protein sample. In the absence of magnesium ions, which are uniquely required by NMDMC for dehydrogenase activity (17Yang X. MacKenzie R.E.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The encoded protein conforms to known DCS sequences in that it consists of separate DC and synthetase domains connected by a short linker region. The human protein has about 57% overall homology to the cytoplasmic DCS (19Sugiura T. Nagano Y. Inoue T. Hirotani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the DC domain has only 33% homology to the cytoplasmic DCS DC domain and has not been demonstrated to possess either dehydrogenase or cyclohydrolase activity (18Prasannan P. Pike S. Peng K.

To determine whether this protein may be responsible for the observed synthetase activity in the DCS null cell lines expression of its message was evaluated by Northern analysis.Fig. 6 shows Northern blots of total RNA isolated from wild type, NMDMC null and DCS null cell lines probed for DCS, NMDMC, and the mitochondrial DCS RNA. Separate probes for the DC and synthetase domains of mtDCS were used to reduce the possibility of confounding results because of cross hybridization. All three messages were detected in all three cell lines, with the exception of the NMDMC and DCS messages in their respective knock-out cell lines. The Northern results also show that the probes for DCS and mtDCS do not cross-hybridize.Fig. 6Northern analysis of wild type, NMDMC null, and DCS null cell lines.

Biofactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar) and has been used in several metabolic studies tracking the flow of one-carbon units carried by THF in mammals. This model contains an NADP-dependent DCS in the mitochondria, in analogy to the mitochondrial DCS protein found in yeast mitochondria. Although the inclusion of this hypothetical protein in models of one-carbon folate metabolism does little to change the interpretation of radiotracer studies, it ignores the lack of strong evidence to support a trifunctional DCS in mammalian mitochondria.The mitochondrial NAD-dependent protein NMDMC activity was first detected in 1960 in Erlich ascites tumor cells (21Scrimgeour K.G. Huennekens F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1960; 2: 230-233Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This protein remains the only methyleneTHF dehydrogenase in mammalian mitochondria to have been identified and characterized (9Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14616-14620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown through the comparison of the genes of NMDMC and DCS in mouse, human, and Drosophila that NMDMC arose from a trifunctional precursor through the loss of the synthetase domain and the change in cofactor specificity from NADP to NAD (8Patel H. Christensen K.E. Mejia N. MacKenzie R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 403: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This cofactor specificity change is often neglected in applying the yeast-based model to mammals. The use of NAD in embryonic and transformed cells shifts the equilibrium of the reaction to favor the production of 10-formylTHF over that of methyleneTHF (22Pelletier J.N. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12673-12680Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This shift optimizes the mitochondrial system to produce one-carbon units, presumably as formate, for use in purine synthesis in the cytoplasm as was found in yeast. Patel et al. (10Patel H. Di Pietro E. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19436-19441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the growth of NMDMC null fibroblasts is enhanced by the addition of formate to the medium. It was also shown that there is an increase of 14C-labeled formate into DNA in NMDMC null mutants, as compared with wild type cells. These results confirmed that, as in yeast, the mitochondria serve as sources of one-carbon units in the form of formate for use in purine synthesis in the cytoplasm. There was, however, a gap in our model that could not explain how formate is released from formyl-THF in the mitochondria to enter the cytoplasm. There are several possibilities including a 10-formylTHF hydrolase or a separate 10-formylTHF synthetase. Wild type murine fibroblast extracts have been assayed for 10-formyl hydrolase activity, but no activity was detected. 4N. R. Mejia, unpublished observation.Because of the relatively high activity of the cytoplasmic DCS, attempting to detect a mitochondrial synthetase from whole cell extracts, even if overexpressed, presents a technical challenge. Even when subcellularly fractionated, very small amounts of contamination from the cytoplasmic enzyme could have a significant effect on the results of enzyme assays. Therefore, a knock-out of DCS provides the best opportunity to examine mitochondria for additional dehydrogenase and synthetase activities.In the DCS null cells 10-formylTHF synthetase activity is observed both in whole cell and mitochondria extracts. Even when the sample is concentrated for mitochondrial proteins, as in Fig. 5, there is no detectable dehydrogenase activity that is not attributable to NMDMC. These assays can detect NADP-dependent dehydrogenase activity down to 1 milliunit/ml, which would permit the detection of as little as 1% of the observed NAD-dependent dehydrogenase activity. The mtDCS described by Prasannan et al. (18Prasannan P. Pike S. Peng K. Shane B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43178-43187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and Sugiura et al. (19Sugiura T. Nagano Y. Inoue T. Hirotani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) may provide the identity of the observed synthetase. Northern blots of total RNA extracted from wild type, NMDMC null, and DCS null transformed cell lines show that the mtDCS is expressed in these cell lines (Fig. 6). Recent work by Di Pietro et al. (12Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Patel et al. (10Patel H. Di Pietro E. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19436-19441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) has shown that there is only one methyleneTHF dehydrogenase expressed in embryonic and transformed cells. This observation is in agreement with the failure of both groups to detect dehydrogenase activity both in yeast overexpressing the mtDCS cDNA (18Prasannan P. Pike S. Peng K."
https://openalex.org/W2092918496,"The acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) is a 10-kDa intracellular lipid-binding protein that transports acylCoA esters. The protein is expressed in most cell types at low levels; however, expression is particularly high in cells with a high turnover of fatty acids. Here we confirm a previous observation that ACBP expression in rodent liver is down-regulated by fasting, and we show that insulin but not glucose is the inducer of ACBP expression in primary rat hepatocytes. In keeping with the regulation by insulin, we show that ACBP is a sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) target gene in hepatocytes. Members of the SREBP family activate the rat ACBP gene through binding sites for SREBP and the auxiliary factors Sp1 and nuclear factor Y in the proximal promoter. In addition, we show that ACBP is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α target gene in cultured hepatocytes and is induced in the liver by fibrates in a PPARα-dependent manner. Thus, ACBP is a dual PPARα and SREBP-1c target gene in hepatocytes. Fasting leads to reduced activity of SREBP but increased activity of PPARα in hepatocytes, and in keeping with ACBP being a dual target gene, we show that ACBP expression is significantly lower in livers from PPARα knock-out mice than in livers from wild type mice. In conclusion, expression of ACBP in rodent hepatocytes is subject to dual metabolic regulation by PPARα and SREBP-1c, which may reflect the need for ACBP during lipogenic as well as lipo-oxidative conditions.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14118-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The protein has been found in all eukaryotes investigated to date and is structurally and functionally highly conserved through evolution (4Kragelund B.B. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 150-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Based on the high conservation of the protein and a large number of in vitro studies, ACBP is believed to play an important role in intracellular acyl-CoA transport and pool formation (5Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). However, the exact role of ACBP in lipid metabolism is still unknown. Disruption of the ACBP gene in yeast indicated that ACBP is involved in the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids and is required for proper protein sorting and vesicular trafficking (6Gaigg B. Neergaard T.B. Schneiter R. Hansen J.K. Faergeman N.J. Jensen N.A. Andersen J.R. Friis J. Sandhoff R. Schroder H.D. Knudsen J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The mammalian ACBP gene is a typical housekeeping gene (7Mandrup S. Hummel R. Ravn S. Jensen G. Andreasen P.H. Gregersen N. Knudsen J. Kristiansen K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although the level of ACBP differs markedly among different cell types. Cell types with a high level of ACBP expression include hepatocytes, steroidogenic cells, and adipocytes (8Bovolin P. Schlichting J. Miyata M. Ferrarese C. Guidotti A. Alho H. Regul. Pept. 1990; 29: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Knudsen J. Mandrup S. Rasmussen J.T. Andreasen P.H. Poulsen F. Kristiansen K. Mol. Cell.

Stunnenberg H.G. Kristiansen K. Mandrup S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26821-26830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that the mammalian ACBP gene is subject to metabolic regulation. Thus, it was reported that fasting of rats resulted in a modest but significant decrease in the level of ACBP expression in the liver, whereas a high fat diet induced ACBP expression (11Sterchele P.F. Vanden H.J. Davis J.W. Shrago E. Knudsen J. Peterson R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Bhuiyan J. Pritchard P.H. Pande S.V. Seccombe D.W. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1185-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results suggest that increased ACBP expression may be linked to lipid accumulation. In keeping with that, ACBP expression is drastically induced during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (13Hansen H.O. Andreasen P.H. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This induction is most likely mediated, at least in part, by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). We have recently identified a functional peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) in intron 1 of the human, rat, and mouse ACBP genes and have shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation that this element binds PPARγ in adipocytes (10Helledie T. Grontved L. Jensen S.S. Kiilerich P. Rietveld L. Albrektsen T. Boysen M.S. Nohr J. Larsen L.K. Fleckner J. Stunnenberg H.G. Kristiansen K. Mandrup S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26821-26830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). ACBP expression has also been reported to be induced in the liver of rodents in response to administration of peroxisome proliferators, suggesting that ACBP is a PPARα target gene. In keeping with that, we have shown that PPARα in transient transfections is able to activate ACBP expression through the intronic PPRE (10Helledie T. Grontved L. Jensen S.S. Kiilerich P. Rietveld L. Albrektsen T. Boysen M.S. Nohr J. Larsen L.K. Fleckner J. Stunnenberg H.G. Kristiansen K. Mandrup S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26821-26830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It remains to be shown, however, whether PPARα is indeed involved in the induction of ACBP expression by peroxisome proliferators in vivo. As ACBP expression is reported to be repressed by fasting, ACBP does not appear to belong to the group of typical PPARα target genes, which are known to be induced by fasting. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ACBP expression in hepatocytes are presently unknown. If ACBP expression is indeed repressed by fasting, it appears likely that it, by analogy with other genes, would be under the control of transcription factors activated by either glucose and/or insulin. A sterol regulatory element (SRE) has been identified in the proximal promoter of the human ACBP gene. This SRE mediates activation by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1a (SREBP-1a) and confers sterol repression and androgen activation to the human proximal acbp promoter in transient transfections of the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP (14Swinnen J.V. Alen P. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19938-19944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a is only expressed at low levels in hepatocytes in vivo (15Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar); however, another member of the SREBP family, SREBP-1c, has been shown to be necessary for induction of lipogenic genes in rat hepatocytes in response to insulin (16Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J.I. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that SREBP-1c might play a role in the regulation of the rodent ACBP gene in hepatocytes in response to fasting and feeding. In keeping with this hypothesis, we show here that insulin and not glucose induces ACBP expression in primary rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, we show that the proximal SRE is indeed functionally conserved in the rat ACBP gene and can mediate transactivation by all members of the SREBP family, including SREBP-1c. Transient transfection of hepatocytes with promoter-reporter constructs encompassing –2310 bp upstream of the rat ACBP translation start site and the entire exon 1 and intron 1 shows that activation by SREBPs is strictly dependent on this SRE. These results strongly indicate that the SRE in the proximal promoter is indeed mediating insulin activation of the ACBP gene in vivo. Detailed dissection of the sequence surrounding the SRE identified upstream binding sites for NF-Y and Sp1, respectively, both of which are necessary for optimal induction by SREBPs. Finally, we show that ACBP is a PPARα target gene in hepatocytes in vivo and that disruption of the PPARα gene leads to further reduction of ACBP expression in the liver during fasting. These results indicate that the ACBP gene during fasting is subject to opposing metabolic regulation by SREBP and PPARα, respectively. Materials—Minimum Eagle's medium, Schneider's medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1), fetal calf serum, sodium pyruvate, antibiotics, and nonessential amino acids were purchased from Invitrogen. Insulin, glucose, and insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite media supplement were purchased from Sigma. Gene-specific primers for real time PCR were purchased from DNA Technology A/S (Denmark). BigDye™ Terminator cycle sequencing kit and 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix were from Applied Biosystems (Denmark). Lysis buffer for harvesting cells after transfection was from Tropix (Denmark). Fenofibrate and ciprofibrate the were kind gifts of Drs. A. Edgar (Laboratoires Fournier, Daix, France) and M. Riteco (Sanofi, Winthrop, Maassluis, The Netherlands), respectively. Animal Experiments—For the WT fasting/refeeding experiment, 20 C57BL/6JBom male mice, 9 weeks old, were divided at random into four groups with five individuals/group. The mice were kept at a 12-h light/dark cycle (6.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.) at 22 °C with free access to food and water. Following 2 weeks on a standard chow diet (Altromin 1324), the experiment was initiated in the morning at the beginning of the 12-h light cycle. Food was withdrawn from three of the groups. One group continued on the Altromin 1324 diet during the experiment (control group). After 24 h of fasting, one fasting group was sacrificed. The remaining two fasted groups were given a high carbohydrate (64.5%)/very low fat (0.083%) diet (Altromin C1056). One of these groups was sacrificed after 12 h of refeeding on the high carbohydrate/very low fat diet, and the other group was sacrificed after 24 h of refeeding on the high carbohydrate/very low fat diet. The control group was sacrificed in the morning at the end of the experiment. Liver tissue samples were collected from all animals, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. The fasting experiment using PPARα KO and WT mice was performed similarly. One group of mice of each genotype (WT, n = 5; KO, n = 4) was subjected to 24 h of fasting initiated in the morning. After 24 h of fasting, the mice were killed, and liver tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until RNA purification could be performed. Fed mice of each genotype were sacrificed in the morning (WT, n = 4; KO, n = 3). For fibrate treatment, male 129/SvPas homozygous PPARα KO and WT mice (10–12 weeks of age) were fed for 17 days with either a standard mouse chow or one containing 0.2% (w/w) fenofibrate or 0.05% (w/w) ciprofibrate. At the end of the treatment period, each group of animals (n = 7) was fasted for 4 h and killed. Livers were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until RNA preparation. Cell Culture—HepG2 cells from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were grown in minimum Eagle's medium, with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin. Drosophila Schneider cells, SL2, were grown in Schneider's medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. AML-12 cells from ATCC were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite media supplement, and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion from livers of Wistar rats (18Torra I.P. Tsibulsky V. Delaunay F. Saladin R. Laudet V. Fruchart J.C. Kosykh V. Staels B. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3799-3806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (cell viability higher than 85% by trypan blue exclusion test) were cultured as a monolayer in serum-free William's E medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 25 μg/ml gentamycin, 100 nm dexamethasone, and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. After 4 h of incubation, medium was changed to glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 25 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 nm dexamethasone, and 5.5 mm d-glucose. After overnight culture, cells were incubated for the indicated time in fresh culture medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 25 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 nm dexamethasone, and the indicated concentrations of d-glucose and insulin. RNA Purification and Real Time qPCR—Total RNA was purified, and cDNA was synthesized and quantified by real time qPCR using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Each PCR contained, in a final volume of 25 μl, 1 μl of first-strand cDNA, 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, and 5 pmol of each primer. All reactions were performed using the following cycling conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. PCR was carried out in 96-well plates and in duplicate. Primers for real time PCR were designed using Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Target gene mRNA expression was normalized to TFIIB or TBP mRNA expression, and the relative amounts of all mRNAs were calculated.

All protein extracts were treated with Benzonase® (Merck). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bradford reagent). Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) from animals/cells treated similarly were pooled. From these stocks, 75 μg of protein was separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide mini gels. Protein was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Micron Separation) and stained with Amido Black to confirm equal loading. Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-rat ACBP (1:1500) and rabbit anti-TFIIB (C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:1000). The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) (Dako). Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Plasmids—Rat acbp promoter reporter construct pluc-rACBP(–182/+1) was constructed by inserting the promoter fragment in the pGl3-basic vector (Promega). The mutation of the pluc-rACBP(–182/+1)mutSRE, pluc-rACBP(–182/+1)mutNF-Y, and pluc-rACBP(–182/+1)mutSRE/NF-Y were obtained using the megaprimer method (21Br øns-Poulsen J. Petersen N.E. H ørder M.

Adenoviral Vectors and Transduction of AML-12 Cells—Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by subcloning the respective cDNA (SREBP-1c) or full-length (mouse PPARα) sequence into pShuttle and recombining these constructs with adenoviral vectors using the AdEasy cloning system from Stratagene (AH-diagnostic, Denmark). The constitutive active rat SREBP-1c cDNA was derived from pSVSPORT-ADD1–403 (28Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) and used to make Ad-CA-SREBP-1c. Viruses were amplified in HEK293 cells and purified by using CsCl ultracentrifugation followed by desalting on PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Titers of adenoviruses were initially determined by plaque assay, and equal viral concentrations in the different experiments were subsequently verified by determining expression of the adenoviral transcript AdE4 normalized to TFIIB expression by real time qPCR. Cells were transduced by adding the viruses directly to the media. Media containing the viruses were removed after 2 h, and new media were added for further incubation (22 h). Statistical Analysis—Data from the feeding experiments were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Analyst application (SAS release 8.02 (1999–2001) by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Results are presented as mean ± S.D. ACBP Expression Is Regulated by Fasting/Refeeding in Rodents—Previous semi-quantitative studies have shown that rats that have been fasted have a decreased expression level of ACBP mRNA and protein in the liver (12Bhuiyan J. Pritchard P.H. Pande S.V. Seccombe D.W. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1185-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and that feeding a high fat diet increases hepatic ACBP mRNA (11Sterchele P.F. Vanden H.J. Davis J.W. Shrago E. Knudsen J. Peterson R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), indicating that ACBP expression is metabolically regulated. To establish further how fasting and feeding regulated ACBP expression, we performed a fasting/refeeding experiment with mice. Twenty C57BL/6JBom male mice were divided randomly into four groups with five individuals per group. The control group received standard diet ad libitum throughout the study. The remaining three groups were fasted for 24 h. Subsequently the second group was sacrificed, and liver tissue was collected for RNA isolation. The remaining two fasting groups were given a high carbohydrate/very low fat diet and sacrificed after 12 and 24 h of refeeding, respectively. As reported previously (16Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J.I. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), hepatic mRNA levels of ACC and fatty-acid synthetase (FAS) were down-regulated by fasting and superinduced by refeeding (Fig. 1A). Regulation of FAS activity during fasting/refeeding is known to take place primarily at the transcriptional level (reviewed in Ref. 29Sul H.S. Wang D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 331-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), whereas ACC activity is regulated transcriptionally as well as post-translationally (reviewed in Ref. 30Kim K.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The transcriptional effects are supposed to be mediated by a combined effect of insulin-induced activation of SREBP-1c and glucose-induced activation of the carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP) (31Uyeda K. Yamashita H. Kawaguchi T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c itself is known to be induced by refeeding, both at the mRNA and at the protein levels (16Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J.I. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y.

In keeping with this, the regulation of SREBP-1c mirrored the regulation of FAS and ACC (Fig. 1A). Expression of ACO is known to be induced in response to PPARα activation (16Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J.I. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), and this regulation is reflected in similar changes in protein expression (33Hashimoto T. Fujita T. Usuda N. Cook W. Qi C. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19228-19236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, ACO expression was significantly induced by fasting and was down-regulated by refeeding. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1), which is an SREBP-1c (34Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.N. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and a PPARα (35Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) target gene, but which has not been reported to be regulated by ChREBP, was more modestly down-regulated by fasting. The induction of SCD-1 by refeeding was less dramatic and not observed until after 24 h of refeeding. Hepatic ACBP mRNA level was modestly but significantly reduced in mice fasted for 24 h compared with ad libitum fed control animals (Fig. 1A), and similar to SCD-1 expression, 24 but not 12 h of refeeding reestablished ACBP expression. A similar regulation of ACBP protein expression was observed (Fig. 1B). ACBP Expression Is Induced by Insulin but Not by Glucose in Primary Rat Hepatocytes—To investigate whether the regulation of ACBP expression in hepatocytes by fasting/refeeding is mediated by glucose and/or insulin, we treated freshly isolated primary rat hepatocytes with either increasing concentrations of insulin (Fig. 2A) or increasing concentrations of glucose (Fig. 2B). These experiments clearly demonstrated that both ACBP and SREBP-1c expressions are induced by insulin (Fig. 2A) and not by glucose (Fig. 2B) in rat hepatocytes. The activation of SREBP-1c expression by insulin but not glucose is in keeping with previous findings that insulin and not glucose is the prime inducer of SREBP-1c expression in rat hepatocytes (36Shimomura I.

Recently, we reported that Isc1p is post-translationally activated in the post-diauxic phase of growth and that it localizes to mitochondria (Vaena de Avalos, S., Okamoto, Y., and Hannun, Y. A. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 11537–11545). In this study the in vivo mechanisms of activation and function of Isc1p were investigated. Deletion of ISC1 resulted in markedly lower growth in non-fermentable carbon sources. Interestingly, the growth defect of isc1Δ strains resembled that of pgs1Δ strains, lacking the committed step in the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), which were shown to activate Isc1p in vitro. Therefore, the role of Pgs1p in activation of Isc1p in vivo was investigated. The results showed that in the pgs1Δ strain, the growth-dependent activation of Isc1p was impaired as was the ISC1-dependent increase in the levels of phytoceramide during the post-diauxic phase, demonstrating that the activation of Isc1p in vivo is dependent on PGS1 and on the mitochondrial phospholipids PG/CL. Mechanistically, loss of Isc1p resulted in lower levels of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunits cox3p and cox4p, previously established targets of both PG and CL (Ostrander, D. B., Zhang, M., Mileykovskaya, E., Rho, M., and Dowhan, W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 25262–25272), thus suggesting that Isc1p mediates at least some functions downstream of PG/CL. This study provides the first evidence for the mechanism of in vivo activation and function of Isc1p. A model with endogenous PG/CL as the in vivo activator of Isc1p is proposed.

Ceramide is a bioactive lipid that in eukaryotic cells functions as a mediator of a variety of extracellular signals through the regulation of several downstream effectors which in turn control basic cellular functions such as cell growth, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence (1Vaena de Avalos S.

Sphingolipids are also important regulatory molecules in yeast where they are known to be required for viability (7Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell.

Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae do not contain SM, they do contain inositol phosphoceramides, and recently we identified a homologue of neutral sphingomyelinase in S. cerevisiae, Isc1p, which acts on phosphoceramides to generate ceramide. This enzyme displays ∼30% identity to neutral sphingomyelinase 2 and shares with it several common features (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11537-11545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) including hydrolytic activity on SM, the requirement of Mg2+ for optimal activity, optimal neutral pH, and the presence of a newly discovered domain that is conserved in the entire family of sphingomyelinases, the P-loop-like domain (13Okamoto Y. Vaena de Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7855-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which appears to be important for substrate binding and/or catalysis. In addition, both enzymes demonstrate an absolute requirement for anionic phospholipids for in vitro activation. Thus, Isc1p is activated selectively in vitro by cardiolipin (CL), phosphtidylglycerol (PG), or phosphatidylserine. In a recent study we demonstrated that the enzyme binds these anionic phospholipids, and we identified the second transmembrane domain and the C terminus of Isc1p as required for this binding, and it was proposed that this interaction plays a critical role in enzyme function through a novel tethering mechanism of enzyme activation by lipid cofactors (14Okamoto Y. Vaena De Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46470-46477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Given these specific requirements for anionic phospholipids in vitro, it became important to determine whether the enzyme requires phospholipids for activation in vivo. Our attention was particularly directed to the possible roles of PG and CL as the deletion of PGS1, the gene that encodes the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of PG phosphate, and subsequent synthesis of PG and CL was shown to cause a late defect during growth in glucose media similar to that of ISC1. Moreover, these lipids are almost exclusively present in mitochondria, and we have shown recently that Isc1p localizes preferentially to mitochondria in the post-diauxic phase of growth. Synthesis of CL in yeast requires three sequential reactions. The first step is the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerophosphate from CDP diacylglycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate. This reaction, catalyzed by phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase (Pgs1p), is the committed and rate-limiting step. Then PG phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to PG. Finally, PG is converted to CL by cardiolipin synthase (Cls1p) with CDP diacylglycerol as co-substrate. CL has been postulated to be important for the function of mitochondria (15Hoch F.L. Biochim.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 239-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a nuclear-encoded subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (cox). On the other hand, the absence of PG (and CL) because of lack of PGS1 was shown to cause severe mitochondrial dysfunction (19Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

Recently, a role for Pgs1p in the translation of cox proteins was proposed based on the finding that the pgs1Δ strain exhibited a serious deficiency in translation of cox proteins (24Ostrander D.B.

Recently, Isc1p was found to become activated and to localize to the mitochondria during the diauxic shift, resulting in an increase in the levels of phytoceramide during growth of yeast cells (12Vaena de Avalos S.

In the present study the in vivo mechanism of Isc1p activation was investigated. Materials—Anti-porin, anti-cox3p, and anti-cox4p were obtained from Molecular Probes. Monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Sigma. Goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were acquired from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA).

Ceramides and phytoceramides (d-erythro-C12-NBD-ceramide, d-erythro-C6-ceramide, d-ribo-C12-NBD-phytoceramide, and d-ribo-C6-phytoceramide) were obtained from the Lipidomics Core at MUSC. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Yeast extract and peptone were from Difco. Synthetic minimal medium (SD), SD/Gal, and Ura dropout supplement were purchased from BD Bioscience Pharmingen/Clontech.

Cells were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose or yeast extract/peptone containing other carbon sources (3% glycerol, 2% lactate, 2% ethanol, or 3% acetate) as stated. Plasmids were transfected into cells from the strains mentioned above as described (27Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Strains carrying pYes2 constructs were grown in SD, 2% glucose and ura dropout supplement. Single colonies were inoculated in SD-ura media and incubated at 30 °C in a shaker incubator at 250 rpm/min. Exponentially growing cultures were induced in galactose media for 24 h before inoculating new cultures in galactose overnight to reach the exponential phase, and then cells were washed before experiments. For experiments with strains that did not grow in galactose, media containing glucose and galactose was employed. Growth experiments were started by dilution of the culture with 5 ml of fresh media to a density of 0.1 A600 units and incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C. Sphingolipids resuspended in ethanol or ethanol as vehicle were added to cells, and the final concentration of ethanol was 0.05%, which was not inhibitory for the growth of wild type or mutant cells. Growth curves were determined by measuring the A600 at different time points. Assay of Isc1p Activity—Because untransformed isc1Δ cells present no sphingomyelinase activity and because the activity of partially purified enzyme from ISC1-overexpressing cells was unstable, as described previously (14Okamoto Y. Vaena De Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46470-46477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), unless otherwise stated cell lysates were used to determine Isc1p activity as described with modifications (14Okamoto Y. Vaena De Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46470-46477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated in 100 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 nmol (6.7 mol %) of phosphatidylserine, 10 nmol (6.7 mol %) of unlabeled SM, and 100,000 dpm of [choline-methyl-14C]SM at 30 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, 1.0 ml of chloroform, 0.5 ml of methanol, and 0.2 ml of water were added according to the method of Folch et al. (28Folch J. Leos M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity in a portion (400 μl) of the upper phase was mixed with Safety Solve (Research Products International) for liquid scintillation counting. Protein Determination, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—Five micrograms of total protein (for detection using anti-FLAG antibody in overexpressor extracts), 40 μg of total protein (for anti-cox detection in mitochondrial extracts), or 10 μg of total protein unless otherwise specified were resuspended in reducing buffer, resolved in a 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11537-11545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Measurements of Mass Levels of Phytoceramide—Cells were harvested and washed with water, and lipids were extracted following the method of Bligh and Dyer (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chloroform organic phase was divided into aliquots, dried down, and processed for inorganic phosphorous determination or phytoceramide measurements using the Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase assay. Phytoceramide was quantitated using external standards and normalized for phosphorous content (30Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Phosphoglycerolipids—Yeast cells were cultured as described above and inoculated in 5 ml of complete synthetic media with low phosphate and glucose as a carbon source. Phospholipids were labeled to steady state by adding 50 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate to growth media, and cells were incubated for 24 h. Total phospholipids were extracted by chloroform and analyzed by TLC using a 68:28:8 chloroform:methanol:acetic acid solvent system. TLC plates were exposed to phosphorimaging screens, and PG, CL, and phosphatidylethanolamine were quantified. Isolation of Mitochondria—Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the P13 pellets. Isolation of mitochondria was based on published procedures (31Glick B.S. Pon L.A.

Acta. 2000; 1486: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) which reported that microsomes associated with the mitochondrial surface can be removed in part by decreasing the pH of the isolation buffer (33Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were prepared in buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1.2 m sorbitol) and resuspended in buffer B containing 10 mm K+-MES (pH 6.0), 0.6 m sorbitol, 0.5 mm EDTA. After the addition of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the cellular homogenate was obtained, and crude mitochondrial preparations were isolated as described by Glick and Pon (31Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Fluorescence—Cells were loaded on a glass slide precoated with poly-l-lysine, and the cells were covered with a coverslip for microscopic visualization. The excitation wavelength for GFP was 488 nm, and 525/550-nm emission was detected. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were examined under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META) with a Plan Apo Chromat X63 oil objective (N.A. 1.4), and images were captured using LSM 510 META software version 3.2. It was recently shown that isc1Δ has a growth defect evidenced as a slow-growth phenotype in glucose-containing media relative to wild type strains, especially during the post-diuaxic shift (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11537-11545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, Isc1p was shown to translocate to the mitochondria and to be activated with a resulting increase in the levels of intracellular phytoceramide (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11537-11545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because of these considerations, it became important to further investigate the role of Isc1p during growth/diauxic shift. Thus, the ability of this mutant to grow in media containing non-fermentable carbohydrates as the only carbon source (NFCS) was evaluated. Compared with the wild type strain, isc1Δ showed a severe defect in growth when glycerol was used as the carbon source (Fig. 1a), and this defect in growth was significantly more pronounced compared with the growth defect in glucose (maximal ∼88% versus ∼30%). In addition, growth of isc1Δ was markedly affected when cells were grown in other NFCS such as lactate, ethanol, or acetate as opposed to the fermentable sources glucose or galactose (Fig. 2). Although the defects in ethanol or lactate were less profound, these were still more pronounced than with the fermentable sources. Therefore, these results confirm the role for Isc1p in growth, and they seem to indicate that the reduced growth of isc1Δ at the diauxic shift (when most glucose is consumed and only NFCS remains) is due to a defect of this mutant to grow in NFCS.Fig. 2Effect of carbon sources on growth of isc1Δ. wt or isc1 null mutant (isc1Δ) cells were grown for the indicated number of hours in media containing galactose (a), ethanol (b), acetate (c), or lactate (d) as the carbon source, and the A600 was determined. The results are the averages of triplicate experiments. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above results coupled with previous results demonstrating activation of Isc1p in mitochondria during the diauxic shift (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11537-11545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) led us to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of Isc1p in growth and, in particular, the roles of CL and PG, the main anionic phospholipids in mitochondria. Initially, the growth of isc1Δ was compared with that of a strain null for PG synthase (pgs1Δ), the enzyme responsible for synthesis of PG and CL. The behavior of isc1Δ was very similar to that of pgs1Δ (Fig. 1). Indeed, both strains showed growth similar to wild type strains when grown in glucose up to 8 h, and from 12 h to 72 h a reduction in the A600 values for isc1Δ and pgs1Δ was readily detected and persisted between 24 and 72 h. In glycerol, growth of isc1Δ and pgs1Δ was profoundly impaired, remaining low for the entire duration up to 72 h (Fig. 1a). The similarity between the defects observed with the pgs1Δ and the isc1Δ strains suggested a link between the in vivo role of Pgs1p/Cls1p and the role of Isc1p during growth such that Isc1p and Pgs1p and/or Cls1p might either work (a) sequentially (upstream or downstream in the same pathway), (b) in separate branches of the same pathway, or (c) in different signaling pathways regulating cell growth. To evaluate these possibilities two approaches were carried out. First, the activation of Isc1p during growth of the mutant strains was determined as described previously (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11537-11545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Isc1p specific activity was, therefore, assayed in 4- and 24-h (pre- and post-diauxic, respectively) extracts from the wild type, pgs1Δ,or cls1Δ strain. Isc1p showed the predicted higher specific activity at the diauxic shift versus the early log phase with ∼3-fold activation at 24 versus 4 h. Interestingly and in contrast, the growth-dependent activation of Isc1p was markedly lost in the pgs1Δ strain with only a ∼40% increase in the activity of Isc1p observed at the post-diauxic phase (Fig. 3a). These results reveal that lack of PGS1 and production of PG/CL impairs the activation of Isc1p during growth. On the other hand, cls1Δ showed Isc1p activation very similar to the parental strain, indicating that the lack of CLS1 and of only CL does not impair the activation of Isc1p. Because it has been shown that Isc1p changes its localization from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria after the post-diauxic shift (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11537-11545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it became of interest to determine whether Pgs1p exerts a role on the translocation of Isc1p. Cells from wild type, pgs1Δ, or cls1Δ strains were transformed with GFP-Isc1 and analyzed by confocal microscopy at 4 and 24 h (Fig. 4a). All strains showed similar localization of GFP-Isc1, the curved endoplasmic reticulum structure during the pre-diauxic phase of growth (at 4 h), and the mitochondrial shape of a tubular branched network after the post-diauxic shift (at 24 h), suggesting that the localization of GFP-Isc1 is not altered in these strains. Although this distinct pattern for mitochondria is widely accepted, a biochemical approach was employed to further test the localization of Isc1p during the diauxic shift in cells that are mutant for the PG/CL pathway. Thus, P13 (13,000 × g pellet) and crude mitochondrial fractions were prepared as described previously (31Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) from wild type or pgs1Δ cells overexpressing FLAG-Isc1 cultured for 24 h and then subjected to immunoblotting for Isc1p, Dpm1p, and porin as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial marker proteins, respectively. These three proteins were detected in the P13 fraction, but only porin and Isc1p were enriched in the further-purified mitochondrial fraction from the pgs1Δ cells (Fig. 4b, right panels), which was similar to the wild type fractions (Fig. 4b, left panels), indicating that the mitochondrial localization of Isc1p is not altered in the pgs1Δ strain. These results argue against a role for Pgs1p in the regulation of Isc1p translocation to the mitochondria during growth. To provide further evidence for a function of Pgs1p upstream of Isc1p in vivo, the levels of phytoceramide, the lipid product of Isc1p, were evaluated. We have previously shown that phytoceramide levels increase during growth, and this increase was dependent on ISC1 (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11537-11545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the levels of phytoceramide were measured in extracts prepared from parental, pgs1Δ, or isc1Δ cells grown for 4 or 24 h, and the levels of phytoceramide were analyzed by the diacylglycerol kinase assay. The levels of phytoceramide increased significantly in the wild type strain in post-diauxic versus early log phase cells (Fig. 5). As previously noted (12Vaena de Avalos S. Okamoto Y. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11537-11545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the levels of phytoceramide not only failed to increase in the isc1Δ strain compared with a wild type strain but also significantly decreased. Importantly, the levels of phytoceramide in the cls1Δ were comparable with the wild type (data not shown); however, the levels of phytoceramide were markedly lower in pgs1Δ cells at the diauxic shift when compared with wild type or to the early log phase cells (Fig. 5). These results provide evidence that in vivo the levels of phytoceramide are reduced in yeast lacking PGS1, reinforcing the conclusion that the lipid products of Pgs1p, PG, and CL exert a role upstream of Isc1p and that PG and CL are required for the Isc1-dependent differential accumulation of phytoceramide during growth (diauxic versus early). Next, we explored the possibility that ISC1 may function upstream of Pgs1p. Because Pgs1p is responsible for the synthesis of both PG and CL, we evaluated the levels of these two lipids in wild type cells or cells lacking Isc1p using 32P labeling as described previously (34Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The autoradiograph showed very similar levels of PG and of CL in wild type and isc1Δ extracts (Fig. 6, first and second lanes, respectively), and this was confirmed by increasing the amount of radioactivity spotted in the thin layer chromatography (third versus fourth lanes). PG and CL were quantified, and the levels were normalized relative to phosphatidylethanolamine. The molar ratio of CL/phosphatidylethanolamine was 0.05 versus 0.052 (wild type versus isc1Δ), and PG/phosphatidylethanolamine was 0.017 versus 0.016 (wild type versus isc1Δ), confirming that these strains have similar levels of CL and PG. Therefore, it is concluded that the lack of Isc1p does not alter the levels of the lipid products of Pgs"

The cytokine signal is initiated when Jak is transphosphorylated in response to a receptor juxtaposition upon ligand binding. The activated Jak subsequently phosphorylates a number of substrates including members of the STAT protein family. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation by Jak kinases, STATs form a homodimer via Src homology 2 (SH2) domain phosphotyrosine interactions and translocates into the nucleus to activate target genes (4Darnell Jr., J.E.

Seven STAT proteins have been identified, STAT1, -2, -3, -4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6. STAT1, STAT3, STAT5a, and STAT5b are activated by numerous cytokines, whereas STAT2, STAT4, and STAT6 have a narrow activation profile. Mice lacking STAT1, STAT4, or STAT6 genes are viable but lose some functions that are mediated by interferons, interleukin 12 (IL-12), or IL-4/IL-13, respectively (6O'Shea J.J.

A wide range of STAT3 activation suggests its multifunctionality and is supported by knock-out mice fetal lethality (11Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

STAT5a and STAT5b are also activated by various cytokines, which are important in growth and development, such as growth hormone, prolactin, erythropoietin (EPO), IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and thrombopoietin. The phenotypes of STAT5a and STAT5b single-gene knock-out mice and double-knock-out mice revealed important roles of STAT5s (12Feldman G.M. Rosenthal L.A. Liu X. Hayes M.P. Wynshaw-Boris A.

The regulation of Jaks and STATs is important for the control of cytokine signaling. Because of the critical role of cytokines in mediating inflammation and immunity, it could be proposed that the up-regulated activation of Jaks could contribute to hematopoietic disorders, autoimmunity, and inflammatory diseases. In this regard recent studies have identified several molecules that regulate cytokine signaling. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS), and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) compose a novel SH2-containing protein family, which is induced by various cytokines that suppress Jak-STAT signaling through a direct interaction with Jak kinases or cytokine receptors (18Kubo M.

Cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS) transgenic mice exhibited a phenotype similar to STAT5-deficient mice, supporting its importance in cytokine signaling by directly influencing the STAT5 signal (22Matsumoto A.

Protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family proteins also inhibit DNA binding activity of activated STAT and subsequent gene expression (23Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 11: 900-911Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Regulation of cytokine signaling has also been shown to be controlled by several protein-tyrosine phosphatases (24Jiao H. Berrada K.

However, it has also been suggested that specific regulation of cytokine signaling may involve additional SH2-containing molecules. Recently, we have cloned a novel adaptor molecule, STAP-2 (signal transducing adaptor protein-2) as a c-fms-interacting protein (27Minoguchi M. Minoguchi S. Aki D. Joo A. Yamamoto T. Yumioka T. Matsuda T. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11182-11189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and STAP-1 as a c-kit-interacting protein (28Masuhara M. Nagao K. Nishikawa M. Sasaki M. Yoshimura A. Osawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). STAP-2 and STAP-1 contain an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) and a region distantly related to the SH2 domain (overall 33% amino acid identity) (28Masuhara M. Nagao K. Nishikawa M. Sasaki M. Yoshimura A. Osawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, STAP-2 has a C-terminal proline-rich region that is not present in STAP-1. The N-terminal PH domain of STAP-2 and STAP-1 shared 36% identity and 58% similarity. The central region of STAP-2 is distantly related to the SH2 domain. This region of STAP-2 shared 40% sequence identity with that of STAP-1 and 29% sequence identity with the SH2 domain of human phospholipase Cγ2 (27Minoguchi M. Minoguchi S. Aki D. Joo A. Yamamoto T.

Human STAP-2 is identical to a recently cloned adaptor molecule, BKS, a substrate of BRK (breast tumor kinase) tyrosine kinase (27Minoguchi M. Minoguchi S. Aki D. Joo A. Yamamoto T. Yumioka T.

STAP-1 has been shown to have hematopoietic-specific expression and associate with STAT5 (28Masuhara M. Nagao K. Nishikawa M. Sasaki M. Yoshimura A. Osawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). STAP-1 was also identified as a Tec-interacting protein, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation and termed as BRDG1 (BCR down-stream signaling 1) (29Ohya K.

Unlike STAP-1, STAP-2/BKS is expressed in a variety of tissues, and its C-terminal region contains the proline-rich, tyrosine phosphorylation motifs and a YXXQ motif. We previously showed STAP-2/BKS expression was strongly induced in hepatocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide or inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, although its expression of myeloid cells is constitutive. Furthermore, we demonstrated that STAP-2/BKS modulated IL-6/STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation through its YXXQ motif (27Minoguchi M. Minoguchi S. Aki D. Joo A. Yamamoto T. Yumioka T.

In the present study we address the involvement of STAP-2/BKS with the STAT5-mediated signaling. We demonstrate STAP-2/BKS physically and functionally interacted with STAT5. Furthermore, thymocytes from STAP-2/BKS-deficient mice showed an enhanced IL-2-dependent growth. These results indicate that STAP-2/BKS is a negative modulator in the STAT5-mediated signaling.

In this regard STAP-2/BKS association with STAT3 up-regulated the ability of STAT3 to induce transcription (27Minoguchi M. Minoguchi S. Aki D. Joo A. Yamamoto T. Yumioka T. Matsuda T. Yoshimura A. J.

Yoshimura A. Osawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) prompted this study to evaluate the functional significance of the interaction. Myc-tagged STAP-2/BKS was co-transfected with either FLAG-tagged STAT5a or FLAG-tagged STAT5b into 293T cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitates with STAP-2/BKS contained STAT5a/b proteins (Fig. 1A). Similarly, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged STAT5a or FLAG-tagged STAT5b alone. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody. Nonspecific bands for STAT5a or STAT5b were not detected (Fig. 1A). We further examined their interaction in a reverse situation. The transfectants were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and blotted with anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitate with STAT5a/b also contained STAP-2/BKS proteins (Fig. 1B). A similar interaction was observed in human T cell leukemia cell line, Jurkat, expressing Myc-tagged STAP-2/BKS. Jurkat/STAP-2/BKS cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT5 antibody and blotted with anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates with anti-STAT5 antibody contained STAP-2/BKS proteins (Fig. 1C). The Western blot analysis of STAP-2 protein showed two bands in Fig. 1, A and B. This is derived from the C-terminal region of STAP-2 because both GST-fused PH- and SH2-like domain did not show two bands. Only the GST-fused C-terminal region (GST-STAP-2 C) showed two bands as shown in Fig. 3H. The STAP-2 protein with a deletion of the C-terminal region also showed a single band (see Fig. 3G). At the present time we do not know the precise mechanisms. This may be due to the posttranscriptional modification such as protein phosphorylation, although no tyrosine phosphorylation was observed when we overexpressed STAP-2 alone in 293T cells (data not shown).Fig. 3Molecular mechanisms of STAP-2/BKS interactions with STAT5.

HUT78 cells were unstimulated or stimulated with IL-2 for 15 min, and the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with control antibody or anti-STAP-2/BKS antibody. The same lysates were also immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT5 antibody. In HUT78 cells endogenous STAT5 was well tyrosine-phosphorylated by IL-2 stimulation (Fig. 1D, lower panel). Furthermore, the immunoprecipitate with anti-STAT5 antibody contained STAP-2/BKS (Fig. 1D, upper panel). It is worthy to note that the amounts of STAP-2/BKS bound to STAT5 decreased as a result of STAT 5 activation/phosphorylation in response to IL-2. The dissociation of STAP-2/BKS from activated STAT5 was also observed in 293T cells overexpressing Jak2. Increasing the amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 resulted in a decrease of the STAP-2/BKS bound to STAT5 (data not shown). Therefore, STAP-2/BKS can directly associate with STAT5. However, their interaction is reduced when STAT5 is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Co-localization of STAP-2/BKS with STAT5—We next examined co-localization of STAP-2/BKS with STAT5a in COS7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2077856249,"Rho family small G proteins are key regulators of cytoskeletal organization and oncogenic transformation whose activation is controlled by a family of proteins known as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). In this work we have characterized the structural and biological determinants for cytoskeletal regulation and cell transformation by the neuroepithelioma transforming gene 1 (NET1), which is a GEF specific for RhoA, but not Cdc42 or Rac1. Previously it was shown that the biological activity and nuclear localization of NET1 is controlled by its amino terminus. Here we demonstrate that the amino terminus of NET1 does not function as cis-acting autoinhibitory domain, nor does it affect the ability of full-length NET1 to stimulate actin stress fiber formation. We also show that the nuclear localization of NET1 is controlled by two separate domains within its amino terminus, only one of which contains the previously identified NLS sequences. Importantly, we find that the ability of NET1 to stimulate actin stress fiber formation does not correlate with its transforming activity, because NET1 proteins that potently stimulate stress fiber formation do not transform cells. Furthermore, the presence of a potential PDZ binding site in the C terminus of NET1 is critical to its ability to transform cells, but is not required for enzymatic activity or for effects on the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, these data highlight a divergence between the ability of NET1 to stimulate cytoskeletal reorganization and to transform cells, and implicate the interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins as critical to NET1-dependent transformation.

Rho family small G proteins play critical roles in regulating many aspects of cell physiology, including cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, vesicle trafficking, cell cycle progression, and neoplastic transformation (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3857) Google Scholar, 2Symons M. Rusk N. Curr.

They do so by acting as molecular switches, cycling between their active, GTP-bound and inactive, GDP-bound states. Once activated, they stimulate signaling in multiple pathways by binding to downstream effector proteins and modulating their activities. Currently at least 21 mammalian Rho family GTPases have been identified, with the Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA proteins being the most thoroughly characterized (5Wherlock M. Mellor H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 239-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of wild type Rho family proteins are controlled by three classes of enzymes known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho GEFs 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; Dbl, diffuse B-cell lymphoma; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; NET1, neuroepithelioma transforming gene 1; wt, wild type; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin.), Rho GTPase-activating proteins, and Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (Rho GDIs) (6Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Rho GEFs stimulate the dissociation of GDP from inactive Rho proteins, thereby promoting their accumulation in the active, GTP-bound state. Rho GTPase-activating proteins stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho proteins, thus causing their inactivation. Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors are cytosolic proteins that bind to inactive, GDP-bound Rho proteins and localize them to the cytosol. Within this regulatory network, it is the Rho GEFs that mediate Rho protein activation in response to extracellular ligands. Thus, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms controlling Rho GEF activity is critical to understanding how growth factors control Rho-dependent signaling. The human Rho GEF family contains over 50 genes, all of which contain two conserved domains known as the Dbl (diffuse B-cell lymphoma) homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (7Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt A. Hall A.

The DH domain is named after the first mammalian Rho GEF identified and accounts for the enzymatic activity of these proteins. The function of the PH domain varies depending upon the Rho GEF being analyzed. Biochemical roles for the PH domain include subcellular targeting, stabilization of the DH domain and enhancement of its activity, and regulation of the interaction with substrate Rho proteins (10Zheng Y.

Rho GEFs exhibit distinct specificities for different Rho family small G proteins in vitro and in cells. For example, the Rho GEF Vav activates RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 equally well, whereas the Rho GEF Tiam1 is specific for Rac1 (7Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms controlling the activities of most Rho GEFs have not been characterized. However, for those few that have been studied, two common regulatory themes have emerged. First, many Rho GEFs contain autoinhibitory domains that negatively regulate their enzymatic activities in the absence of an appropriate stimulus. When these domains are deleted, the Rho GEFs are constitutively activated in vitro and are oncogenic in cell transformation assays (8Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 17Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Physiological mechanisms for release from autoinhibition include altered protein-protein interactions, binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphates, and site-specific phosphorylation. For example, Vav is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine 174 and binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which together block the effects of an amino-terminal autoinhibitory domain (12Han J.

A second common mechanism for controlling Rho GEF activity is through the regulation of intracellular localization. This often entails translocation from the cytosol to receptor complexes at the plasma membrane. For example, the Rho GEF Tiam1 is recruited to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of cells with serum growth factors (11Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L.

The Rho GEF neuroepithelioma transforming gene 1 (NET1) codes for a 595-amino acid protein that consists of tandem DH and PH domains, flanked by amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal extensions of 155 and 93 amino acids, respectively. It was originally cloned as a transforming gene in a screen for novel oncogenes using an NIH 3T3 cell focus formation assay (23Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar). The oncogenic form of NET1 cloned from this screen lacked the first 145 amino acids of the wild type protein, which was critical to its transforming activity, because overexpression of wild type NET1 (wt NET1) was not transforming. Later it was shown that deletion of the first 121 amino acids of NET1 also produced a protein that was transforming in NIH 3T3 focus formation assays and that this form of NET1 (NET1ΔN) catalyzed GDP exchange on RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42 in vitro (24Alberts A.S.

These authors also demonstrated that expression of NET1ΔN stimulated the formation of actin stress fibers, which is a hallmark of RhoA activation, and caused the phosphorylation of c-Jun by the JNK family of mitogen-activate protein kinases when co-expressed in cells. These data indicated that NET1 was a RhoA-specific GEF that was negatively regulated by its amino terminus. However, mechanisms controlling the activity of wt NET1 were not described. Recently it was shown that wt NET1 activity in the cell is controlled through subcellular localization, such that wt NET1 is localized to the nucleus when ectopically expressed in cells (25Schmidt A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14581-14588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this work it was demonstrated that the amino-terminal 121 residues of wt NET1 targets it to the nucleus through the actions of two nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences contained within this region, and that mutation of these NLS sequences resulted in a partial redistribution of full-length NET1 to the cytosol (25Schmidt A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14581-14588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in this same study the PH domain of NET1 was shown to contain a nuclear export signal (NES) sequence. These data suggested that the ability of wt NET1 to regulate RhoA activation is negatively regulated by nuclear localization. However, despite considerable efforts by these authors, extracellular stimuli controlling the export of NET1 from the nucleus were not identified. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling NET1 activity, we have characterized the requirement for distinct domains within NET1 in controlling its enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, and ability to transform cells. Our results demonstrate that two separate domains within the NET1 amino terminus target it to the nucleus, only one of which contains the previously identified NLS sequences. The contribution of this second domain to nuclear localization is critical, because the ability of NET1 to stimulate cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell transformation is dependent upon localization to the cytosol. In addition, we find that the amino terminus of NET1 does not negatively regulate its enzymatic activity in vitro, nor does it down-regulate the ability of NET1 to control actin cytoskeletal organization. The ability of NET1 proteins to stimulate actin stress fiber formation does not correlate with transforming activity, such that NET1 proteins that are extremely potent at stimulating stress fiber formation do not transform cells. Thus, these data highlight a divergence between the ability of NET1 to stimulate cytoskeletal reorganization and to transform cells. This point is emphasized by our finding that a potential PDZ binding site in the C terminus of NET1 must be present for efficient transformation of cells, but is not required for enzymatic activity or for effects on the actin cytoskeleton. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) plus 100 units/ml streptomycin/penicillin (Invitrogen). Swiss 3T3 and NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) plus 100 units/ml streptomycin/penicillin (Invitrogen). HEK 293 and NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of DNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids and Recombinant Proteins—For eukaryotic expression all cDNAs were contained in pEFHA (24Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Wild type, mouse NET1, and NET1ΔN (amino acids 122–595) were as described previously (24Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For NET1 plus NES, the nuclear export sequence (NES) from PKI (LALKLAGLDI) (26Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) was added onto the carboxyl terminus of wild type NET1 by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). For NET1ΔN plus NLS, the nuclear localization signal (NLS) from the SV40 large T antigen (PKKKRKV) was added onto the carboxyl terminus of NET1ΔN by PCR (27Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). The mouse NET1A cDNA was obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (ATCC), and was subcloned into pEFHA by PCR. NET1 156–595, NET1 156–501, NET1-(122–501), NET1ΔNΔC4, and NET1ΔNAla were amplified by PCR and ligated into pEFHA. All cDNAs amplified by PCR were sequenced in their entirety to confirm correct amplification. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NET1 and GST-wild type RhoA fusion proteins were created by subcloning each cDNA into pGEXKG (Amersham Biosciences). BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli (Stratagene) were transformed with the plasmids, and the proteins were expressed by addition of 400 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside after the culture had reached an A600 = 0.8. Incubation with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside continued for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. Cells were lysed by addition of lysozyme followed by sonication, insoluble proteins were pelleted by centrifugation (30 min at 35,000 × g, 4 °C), and GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. Purified fusion proteins were dialyzed into dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and stored at –80 °C. For purification of GST-wt RhoA, 10 μm GDP was included in all purification and dialysis steps. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—GEF assays were performed essentially as described (28Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), using equimolar amounts of GST-NET1 proteins. Briefly, GST-wt RhoA was preloaded for 5 min at room temperature with GDP loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm AMP-PNP, 10 mm GDP, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Loading was terminated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm. Approximately 700 nm GDP-wt RhoA was then incubated with 300 nm NET1 protein in GTPγS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 μCi of [35S]GTPγS, 5 μm GTPγS, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm AMP-PNP, 0.2% Triton X-100) at 30 °C. At different times aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by addition to a 10-ml volume of termination buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). [35S]GTPγS bound to GST-wt RhoA was recovered by filtration through BA85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell). The filters were washed with termination buffer, and bound nucleotide was quantified by liquid scintillation. Microinjection and Indirect Immunofluorescence—Swiss 3T3 cells were plated on glass coverslips and allowed to grow to 30% confluence. Prior to injection the cells were incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin without calf serum. All plasmids were injected into the nuclei of cells at 0.2 mg/ml using an Eppendorf Injectman connected to an Eppendorf 5246 Transjector. Cells to be injected were visualized with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope. Four hours after injection the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. To detect expressed, HA-tagged NET1 proteins the cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml mouse anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS plus 0.2% Tween 20 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (PBST plus bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing 3 × 5 min with PBST, the cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Jackson Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Sigma) (to detect F-actin) diluted in PBST plus bovine serum albumin, for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed 3 × 5 min with PBST and once with distilled water, and then mounted on glass microscope slides with FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem). Fluorescent cells were visualized with either a Zeiss Axioskop with a mounted Hamamatsu C4742-95 digital camera, or a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope. Images were recorded using MetaVue or MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). Subcellular Fractionation—NIH 3T3 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with HA epitope-tagged NET1 expression vectors using Lipofectamine Plus. Prior to harvest the cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without calf serum for 24 h. Cells were then washed once with PBS, resuspended in 0.5 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were then lysed using 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,500 × g, 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g, 4 °C to isolate the cytosol. The nuclear pellets were washed once with 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer, and nuclei were pelleted again by centrifugation at 1,500 × g, 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were then solubilized by resuspension in 2% SDS buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.0% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and DNA was sheared by drawing through a 20-gauge needle 10 times. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g at room temperature, and the supernatant was saved. The concentration of proteins present in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and HA-epitope-tagged NET1 proteins were detected by Western blotting using mouse or rabbit anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit (KPL). Western blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence and visualized with x-ray film (Kodak). The purity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was determined by Western blotting with rabbit anti-lamin B1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-superoxide dismutase-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which are localized to the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, respectively. Foci Formation Assays—Foci formation assays were performed essentially as described previously (29Solski P.A. Abe K. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 425-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, low passage NIH 3T3 cells were transfected in six centimeter dishes (BD Biosciences) with 2 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine Plus. All transfections were performed in duplicate. Cultures were refed every 3–4 days with growth media for a total of 16 days. Cells were then fixed with 10% acetic acid in water for 10 min at room temperature and then stained with 0.4% crystal violet (Sigma) in 10% ethanol in water for 10 min at room temperature. After staining, the cells were washed several times with water, allowed to air dry, and foci were counted. The Amino Terminus of NET1 Does Not Regulate Its Enzymatic Activity—The enzymatic activity of many Rho GEFs is regulated through the actions of a cis-acting autoinhibitory domain (7Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Because deletion of the amino terminus of NET1 creates a protein that is transforming, we examined whether the enzymatic activity of NET1 was also regulated by an amino-terminal autoinhibitory domain. Thus, we compared the relative abilities of the wild type and oncogenic forms of NET1 (wt NET1 and NET1ΔN, respectively) to stimulate GTPγS binding by RhoA in vitro. We also tested a splice variant of NET1 (NET1A) that lacks the first 85 amino acids of wild type NET1 and instead contains an unrelated 31-amino acid segment. This segment does not contain the two NLS sequences found in wild type NET1, and potentially replaces autoinhibitory sequences present in this portion of wt NET1. For these experiments wt NET1, NET1ΔN, and NET1A were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in E. coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. Equimolar amounts of each protein were then tested for GEF activity toward purified GST-RhoA, which was measured through the binding of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS. As shown in Fig. 1, RhoA alone exhibited a modest ability to bind to GTPγS that was greatly enhanced by the addition of each NET1 protein. Furthermore, each NET1 protein exhibited a nearly equivalent activity toward RhoA in vitro. Thus, these data indicate that NET1 does not contain a negative regulatory domain in its amino terminus that directly controls its enzymatic activity, and sets NET1 apart from other Rho GEFs such as Vav, and Dbl, which do contain autoinhibitory domains (30Abe K. Whitehead I.P. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30410-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Splice Variant NET1A Displays a Subcellular Localization and Cellular Activity That Is Distinct from wt NET1— Given that NET1 localization in the cytosol is critical to its ability to regulate the actin cytoskeleton (25Schmidt A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14581-14588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we tested whether NET1A, which lacks the amino-terminal NLS sequences present in wt NET1, was cytosolic and thus behaved as a hyperactive form of NET1. To test this, we examined the ability of NET1A to elicit changes in the actin cytoskeleton as an indicator of NET1 activity. Thus, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with eukaryotic expression vectors for a control protein (β-galactosidase), wt NET1, NET1ΔN, or NET1A. Four hours later the cells were fixed and stained for expression of these proteins and for F-actin. As shown in Fig. 2A, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells are usually flat, stain positive for cortical F-actin, and exhibit few actin stress fibers. Injection of a control plasmid that drives the expression of β-galactosidase did not significantly affect this phenotype (panels a and b). Similarly, expression of wild type NET1 did not stimulate actin stress fiber formation (panels c and d). The wt NET1 was predominantly nuclear, although some cytoplasmic staining was observed in cells expressing very high amounts of NET1 (data not shown). In these cells some increase in F-actin staining was noted, as previously observed (25Schmidt A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14581-14588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of NET1ΔN caused the formation of numerous actin stress fibers in every injected cell (panels e and f). These cells typically were less spread out than the surrounding cells, and the NETΔN protein was localized in both the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm. Importantly, when we tested for effects of NET1A expression, we found that it also potently stimulated actin stress fiber formation (panels g and h). In fact, NET1A was as efficient as NET1ΔN at stimulating the polymerization of actin stress fibers, although NET1A expression did not cause cells to round up in the way that NET1ΔN did. Staining for the expressed NET1A protein demonstrated that there were slightly higher levels of cytoplasmic expression as compared with wt NET1; however, the majority of the NET1A was localized to the nucleus. We confirmed the subcellular localization of these NET1 proteins by subcellular fractionation. For these experiments NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the HA-epitope-tagged NET1 constructs shown. The cells were serum-starved, lysed in a hypotonic buffer, and then separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Equal amounts of these fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of NET1 proteins was detected by Western blotting using an antibody specific for the HA-epitope. We confirmed the validity of our fractionation procedure by blotting for lamin B1 and superoxide dismutase-1, which are localized to the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, respectively. This analysis confirmed that the majority of wt NET1 was localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2B). NET1A was also largely contained in the nuclear fraction, although there was slightly more NET1A in the cytosolic fraction as compared with wt NET1. The majority of NET1ΔN, on the other hand, was localized to the cytoplasm. Thus, taken together these data indicate that NET1A tends to localize to the cytoplasm to a slightly higher degree than wt NET1, and this leads to an increased ability of NET1A to stimulate actin polymerization in the cell. Because NET1A lacks the NLS sequences present in wt NET1 and does not contain an identifiable NLS in the unique portion of its amino terminus, it is unclear as to how NET1A localizes to the nucleus. The DH, PH, and C-terminal regions of wt NET1 do"
https://openalex.org/W2091413884,"Cyanobacterial cells have two autonomous internal membrane systems, plasma membrane and thylakoid membrane. In these oxygenic photosynthetic organisms the assembly of the large membrane protein complex photosystem II (PSII) is an intricate process that requires the recruitment of numerous protein subunits and cofactors involved in excitation and electron transfer processes. Precise control of this assembly process is necessary because electron transfer reactions in partially assembled PSII can lead to oxidative damage and degradation of the protein complex. In this communication we demonstrate that the activation of PSII electron transfer reactions in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 takes place sequentially. In this organism partially assembled PSII complexes can be detected in the plasma membrane. We have determined that such PSII complexes can undergo light-induced charge separation and contain a functional electron acceptor side but not an assembled donor side. In contrast, PSII complexes in thylakoid membrane are fully assembled and capable of multiple turnovers. We conclude that PSII reaction center cores assembled in the plasma membrane are photochemically competent and can catalyze single turnovers. We propose that upon transfer of such PSII core complexes to the thylakoid membrane, additional proteins are incorporated followed by binding and activation of various donor side cofactors. Such a stepwise process protects cyanobacterial cells from potentially harmful consequences of performing water oxidation in a partially assembled PSII complex before it reaches its final destination in the thylakoid membrane.

Photosystem II (PSII) 1The abbreviations used are: PSII, photosystem II; PM, plasma membranes; TM, thylakoid membranes; Chl, chlorophyll; DCMU, 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. 1The abbreviations used are: PSII, photosystem II; PM, plasma membranes; TM, thylakoid membranes; Chl, chlorophyll; DCMU, 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. is an integral membrane chlorophyll-protein complex that is a part of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain in the thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts. PSII catalyzes the extraction of electrons from water and the production of oxygen. The electrons are transferred to plastoquinones through a series of redox active cofactors (1Goussias C. Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1369-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On the electron acceptor side, a pheophytin molecule accepts an electron from the reaction center P680 chlorophyll assembly. The electron is transferred to the QA quinone and finally to the QB quinone. On the donor side, the oxidized P680 extracts an electron from the D1-Yz tyrosine, which in turn extracts an electron from the manganese cluster. Each reaction cycle requires the absorption of four photons to complete the oxidation of two water molecules, produce one di-oxygen molecule, and reduce two plastoquinones (1Goussias C. Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1369-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The photosystem II structure as resolved during recent x-ray crystallographic studies contains 19 protein subunits, 7 carotenoids, 2 hemes, 1 non-heme iron, two pheophytins, and 36 chlorophylls (2Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar). Central to the function of PSII are the D2 and D1 proteins that bind one pheophytin molecule each and form the QA and QB binding sites of the acceptor side of PSII, respectively. In addition, both D1 and D2 participate in the coordination of the P680* chlorophyll assembly at the heart of PSII. The Mn4-Ca-Cl cluster that catalyzes water oxidation on the donor side of PSII is coordinated by amino acid residues in the D1 and CP43 proteins (2Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar). The donor side complex is stabilized by as many as five extrinsic proteins (3Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Assembly of PSII is a continuous process in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, since the radical photochemistry performed by PSII exposes its proteins to photooxidative damage (4Keren N. Ohad I. Rocaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplast and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 569-596Google Scholar). The redox potential of P680 is the highest measured in any biological system (1Goussias C. Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1369-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). PSII proteins in general and the reaction center core D1 protein in particular turn over constantly (4Keren N. Ohad I. Rocaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplast and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 569-596Google Scholar). Notably, the degradation of the D1 protein is accelerated under high light intensities but takes place even under very low light intensities (5Keren N. Berg A. van Kan P.J. Levanon H. Ohad I.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The PSII assembly process is tightly regulated to ensure the correct stoichiometric ratio of its numerous components (6Choquet Y. Wostrikoff K. Rimbault B. Zito F. Girard-Bascou J. Drapier D. Wollman F.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Apart from the protein subunits, chlorophylls, hemes, non-heme iron, and the manganese cluster are assembled into the mature structure. Precise control of the assembly process is required to avoid oxidative damage from partially assembled PSII centers with redox cofactors. The assembly of the manganese cluster, for example, is timed by the cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal extension of the precursor form of the D1 protein (pD1) by the CtpA protease (7Roose J.L. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In our studies on the assembly pathway of PSII in cyanobacteria we took advantage of the polymer two-phase partitioning technique (8Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Using this technique we separated pure plasma membranes (PM) and thylakoid membranes (TM) from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In a previous study we reported the existence of a number of PSII and PSI proteins in the PM (8Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In particular, PM contains the core D1, D2, and cytochrome b559 subunits but not the peripheral CP43 and CP47 subunits of PSII. Furthermore, PSII proteins in the PM were shown to be present in a chlorophyll-protein assembly. Based on these findings, we suggested that the PSII core complex is assembled in PM. In this communication we provide evidence for the activity of PSII in PM and suggest a topological model for the sequence of events that takes place in the pathway of PSII assembly in a cyanobacterial cell. Bacterial Cell Culture Conditions—Synechocystis 6803 cells were grown in BG11 medium (9Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) at 30 °C under 50 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white light. Large volume (3–4 liters) cultures were grown with vigorous bubbling with humidified air. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 5–7 days of growth, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Membrane Isolation and Two-phase Partitioning—Frozen cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in a low salt buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8). Cells were broken in a 50-ml bead beater (Bio Spec, Bartlesville, OK) using 0.17–0.18-mm glass beads. Membranes were collected as described previously (10Norling B. Zak E. Andersson B. Pakrasi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The total membrane pellet was resuspended and homogenized in the two-phase buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8). Two-phase systems were prepared from stock solutions of 20% (w/w) Dextran T-500 (Amersham Biosciences) and 40% (w/w) polyethylene glycol 3350 (Sigma). 3.75 g of total membranes were added to each polymer mixture, resulting in 5.8%, 10-g polymer systems (10Norling B. Zak E. Andersson B. Pakrasi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The tubes were shaken vigorously and placed on ice. Partitioning was performed by centrifugation at 6,700 × g for 10 min in a fixed angle rotor. Upper and lower phases were collected and repartitioned with new lower and upper phases, respectively. The separation procedure was repeated four times for each top and bottom phase. Throughout the procedure the tubes were kept on ice and in darkness to avoid photodamage. Protein Separation and Immunodetection—Membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (3 m urea, 16%). Samples were loaded on an equal protein (30 μg/sample) basis. For immunodetection, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose, incubated with specific antisera, and visualized by chemiluminescence (West Pico, Pierce). Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectroscopy was performed using a DW2000 spectrometer (SLM-AMINCO, Urbana, IL). Chlorophyll concentration was measured in methanol extracts for the membrane fractions (11Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 77 K fluorescence spectrum was measured on a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer (Jobin Ivon, Longjumaeu, France). Fluorescence kinetics were measured on an FL100 apparatus (Photon System Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic). Measurements were performed on an equal chlorophyll basis (16 μg of Chl/ml). Samples were dark-adapted for 3 min before measurement. Manganese concentrations in isolated membranes digested in 5% nitric acid were measured using an AA600 atomic absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Radioactive Herbicide Binding—Radioactive 14C-labeled 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. 1-ml samples containing 25 μg of Chl were incubated with radioactive DCMU in the presence or absence of a 0.1 mm excess cold DCMU. The samples were incubated in the light for 10 min. Then the membranes were sedimented by centrifugation (195,000 × g for 10 min). The concentration of the radioactive DCMU in the medium was measured by scintillation counting as described in Lind et al. (12Lind L.K. Shukla V.K. Nyhus K.J. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1575-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of the radioactivity measured in the presence and absence of cold DCMU was used to calculate the concentrations of bound and free [14C]DCMU. To dissect the function of PSII complexes from purified PM and TM membranes, we have modified the protocol for such membrane isolation (10Norling B. Zak E. Andersson B. Pakrasi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The original two-dimensional protocol required an overnight sucrose gradient centrifugation step. The long preparation time reduces the photochemical activity of the isolated membranes. Instead, we used the polymer two-phase isolation step and omitted the overnight sucrose gradient centrifugation step. The result is a faster procedure, ∼5 h long. The yield of this procedure on a chlorophyll basis is typically around 12%. The overall color of purified PM is orange. This color is a result of absorption typical of carotenoids in the 450 to 550-nm range (Fig. 1A). The dominant chromophore in TM was chlorophyll, evident from the absorption at 440 and 680 nm (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, chlorophyll could be detected in PM (Fig. 1A). The chlorophyll content of PM was 1/10 that of TM on a protein basis (Table I). Although the ratio of chlorophyll to protein in PM was low, its concentration did not fluctuate considerably in the five independent preparations analyzed during the current study (Table I). As markers for the purity of the isolated membranes, we have identified the NrtA and CP47 proteins that are found exclusively in PM and TM, respectively (8Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In our modified preparations, NrtA was not detected in TM, and CP47 could hardly be detected in PM, indicating that the membrane fractions are highly purified (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the chlorophyll detected in PM cannot be a result of TM cross-contamination.Table IProperties of thylakoid and plasma membranesTMPMChl/protein (μg/mg)81 ± 157.1 ± 1.2Mn/Chl (mol/mol)0.05 ± 0.030.23 ± 0.05682/692-nm fluorescence ratio1.002 ± 0.1051.51 ± 0.27Fluorescence rise kinetics, area above the curve (absorbance units)213 ± 2385 ± 9Bound [14C]DCMU (pmol/mg of Chl)120.8116.8 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the chlorophyll present in the purified membrane fractions is functionally assembled, we measured its fluorescence characteristics. In the 77 K fluorescence spectra of isolated TM, a dominant peak at 720 nm was observed (Fig. 2). This peak is a result of photosystem I (PSI) fluorescence (8Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In our previous study, PM-localized PSI core complexes were detected. In addition, such complexes were shown to be capable of light-induced charge separation (8Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have also detected emission peaks at 695 and 684 nm, which are ascribed to fluorescence from PSII. In comparison, in PM a number of major differences were detected. Two new peaks appeared at 673 and 682 nm. A 684-nm peak was not detected, and the 695-nm peak was present as a shoulder of the dominant 682-nm peak. A similar fluorescence spectrum containing blue-shifted peaks was observed in isolated D1-D2-cytochrome b559 PSII core complexes (13Seibert M. Picorel R. Rubin A.B. Connolly J.S. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The 682-nm peak was ascribed to the P680 chlorophyll assembly, and the 673-nm peak was ascribed to unassembled chlorophyll. To verify that the 673-nm peak is truly a result of chlorophyll fluorescence, we measured the excitation spectrum for this wavelength. Indeed, such an excitation spectrum closely resembled the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll (data not shown). Photosynthetic electron transfer activity at room temperature was assayed by measuring time-resolved chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics (14Schreiber U. Krieger A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Overall, PM exhibited three times higher fluorescence levels than TM (Fig. 3A). High chlorophyll fluorescence has been shown to indicate a partially active PSII (15Bennoun P. Delepelaire P. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1982: 25-38Google Scholar). The rise time of chlorophyll fluorescence in PM was much faster than in TM (Fig. 3B and Table I). However, it was still significantly slower than the rise time of extracted chlorophyll in methanol (Fig. 3B). The area above the induction curve, which serves as a measure of the overall rate of fluorescence induction, was 85 ± 9 area units (absorbance units) for PM, whereas the area above the induction curve of extracted chlorophyll was only 40 ± 14 absorbance units (n = 3; see Table I for details). A t test performed on these values indicates that the difference between the two is statistically significant, with a p < 0.05 value. These data show that excitation transfer and charge separation activities take place in PSII complexes in PM, albeit to a smaller extent than in TM. Only after the addition of the PSII inhibitor DCMU did the rise time of TM resemble that of PM (Fig. 3). DCMU binds to the QB site of PSII and inhibits electron transfer to the plastoquinone pool (16Bishop N.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 27: 205-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, fluorescence induction rates in TM were inversely correlated to the actinic light intensity, whereas induction rates in PM were uncorrelated (data not shown). The addition of up to 40 μm artificial PSII acceptor 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone did not affect the fluorescence rise kinetics (data not shown). To examine the PSII acceptor side we tested the DCMU binding properties of purified membrane fractions. Both membrane fractions were able to bind 14C-labeled DCMU (Table I). The bound [14C]DCMU was displaced by an excess of cold DCMU or atrazine. Calculating the fraction of tightly bound DCMU from the difference between total and free [14C]DCMU indicates that the binding properties of TM and PM were similar (Table I). Similar data were recorded when cold atrazine was used to displace [14C]DCMU (data not shown). A more comprehensive analysis of the binding constants and the number of sites per chlorophyll could not be performed due to the large amount of membranes required (3 liters of culture processed for each experiment). Nevertheless, the data presented here demonstrate the existence of an assembled QB site on the acceptor side of PM PSII. The water splitting activity on the donor side of PSII relies on the assembly of the manganese cluster. Our measurements indicate that manganese ions are present in both PM and TM (Table I). The higher manganese concentration detected in the PM is in agreement with our previous study that identified a large manganese pool in the periplasmic space of Synechocystis 6803 cells (17Keren N. Kidd M.J. Penner-Hahn J.E. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15085-15092Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, manganese limitation cannot be the cause of the restriction on electron transfer rates in PM-localized PSII. Furthermore, the addition of up to 5 mm external MnCl2 did not affect the fluorescence rise kinetics of PM (data not shown). Taken together, the properties of PSII in purified PM indicate that the donor side is inactive. Therefore, it is of interest to compare them to the properties of PSII in an established donor side-inactivated mutant. The ΔctpA strain, in which the gene coding for the pD1-processing enzyme is disrupted (18Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8082-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), is such a mutant. A recent study of PSII complexes isolated from this mutant demonstrates that manganese cannot bind to PSII containing the unprocessed pD1 protein (7Roose J.L. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ΔctpA cells are both heterotrophic and light-sensitive. Consequently, it is difficult to produce the total membrane mass required for membrane fractionation. Therefore, the analysis was performed on total membranes. ΔctpA membranes display a number of striking similarities to PSII in the plasma membrane. In the fluorescence spectra, a peak at 682 nm was detected (Fig. 4A). The ratio of 682/695-nm fluorescence in ΔctpA membranes was 1.44, similar to that in PM (Table I). In addition, a shoulder in the 670-nm region of the spectrum was also observed (Fig. 4A). The fluorescence induction kinetics of ΔctpA membranes were similar to those of PM with an area above the curve of 73 absorbance units (Fig. 4B). Also, the addition of DCMU had no effect on the fluorescence kinetics (data not shown). Like PM, the overall fluorescence intensity was 4.5 times higher than TM on an equal chlorophyll basis. Assembly of PSII is a complex process including not only the recruitment of protein subunits at an exact stoichiometric ratio but also the insertion and activation of redox active cofactors. In previous work we found an assembled PSII complex in the PM (8Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because active photosynthesis occurs in the TM we have proposed that the core subunits D1, D2, and cytochrome b559 are assembled in the PM, and the CP43 and CP47 subunits are added in the TM (8Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). During this work we studied the activity of PSII complexes in PM and TM to reconstruct the pathway of cofactor assembly and activation. The PSII centers in PM exhibited fluorescence characteristics similar to those observed in PSII core complexes (13Seibert M. Picorel R. Rubin A.B. Connolly J.S. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These include blue-shifted fluorescence peaks (Fig. 2) and fast fluorescence rise times (Fig. 3). TM membranes, on the other hand, exhibit much slower fluorescence rise kinetics. The fluorescence induction kinetics of TM indicated the ability of PSII in these membranes to undergo multiple turnovers, whereas the PSII in PM cannot. However, since the fluorescence rise kinetics of the PSII centers in PM were significantly slower than those of extracted chlorophyll, it is evident that the PSII in PM was capable of excitation transfer and primary charge separation. The inability of PSII in PM to perform multiple turnovers could be the result of either an unassembled donor side and/or of an unassembled acceptor side of PSII. The herbicide binding experiments indicate the existence of a functional QB site in PM, suggesting that the limitation is not on the acceptor side, and therefore, it is most probably on the donor side. Additional evidence for an unassembled donor side can be found in the comparison between PM and ΔctpA membranes. The fluorescence spectrum and rise kinetic parameters measured in membranes isolated from this donor side-inactive mutant are very similar those measured in PM. In the absence of a manganese cluster, free manganese is able to donate electrons to fully assembled PSII complexes that were stripped from their manganese cluster (19Babcock G.T. Sauer K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 396: 48-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This, however, is not the case in PM-localized PSII in which even the addition of extra manganese did not affect the fluorescence rise kinetics of PM. Importantly, previous studies show that the CP43 protein, which contributes ligands to the manganese cluster (2Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar), is found exclusively in TM (8Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Without the contribution of the CP43 ligands the assembly of a manganese complex is highly unlikely. An inactive manganese cluster on the donor side of PSII has additional effects on the acceptor side. In the absence of D1 processing or after the removal of manganese or calcium ions from the donor side of PSII, the QA/QA– midpoint potential is upshifted by ∼150 mV (20Johnson G.N. Rutherford A.W. Krieger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 202-207Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 21Krieger A. Rutherford A.W. Johnson G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 193-201Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As a result, electron transfer from QA to QB is blocked. This explains the inability of PM-localized PSII to transfer electrons to the artificial acceptor 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone despite the observation that the QB site is functionally assembled. Based on these results we propose the following topological model for the assembly pathway of PSII (Fig. 5). First, the reaction center core is assembled in the PM. This core includes the pD1/D1, D2, and cytochrome b559 proteins. The same proteins were detected in the initial assembly steps of higher plant PSII (22van Wijk K.J. Roobol-Boza M. Kettunen R. Andersson B. Aro E.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6178-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This PSII core protein complex contains the P680 chlorophyll assembly and correctly folded QA and QB quinone binding sites. The second step in PSII assembly is the processing of pD1 by the CtpA protease. The processing of pD1 is necessary but not sufficient for the assembly of the manganese cluster (7Roose J.L. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Next, the PSII core complex is transported to the TM. The mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown. Neither physical contacts nor transport vesicles between PM and TM have been detected in Synechocystis 6803 (23Spence E. Sarcina M. Ray N. Moller S.G. Mullineaux C.W. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Only after the transfer of the core complex into the TM and the recruitment of the CP43 protein can the manganese cluster form. After the assembly of the manganese cluster in the TM, it is stabilized by the binding of the extrinsic manganese-stabilizing proteins, PsbO/U/V/P/Q (3Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). PsbO was detected in both PM and TM (8Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), but in the absence of an assembled manganese cluster it does not bind to the PSII complex (7Roose J.L. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Incorporation of the CP47 protein as well as a number of other smaller integral membrane proteins completes the assembly of a fully functional PSII. Such a stepwise process separates assembly from activity and ensures that PSII complexes will be photochemically active only in the TM. This separation can protect the photosynthetic apparatus from partial electron transfer reactions that can result in the generation of harmful radical species. In the course of its normal function in TM, PSII can be photodamaged by the redox reactions it performs (4Keren N. Ohad I. Rocaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplast and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 569-596Google Scholar). As a result, the D1 protein is degraded and must be replaced. For this process to take place in a cyanobacterial cell, the core D2 and cytochrome b559 proteins must detach from the damaged complex and be transported back to the PM, where a new pD1 protein will be inserted. As in the case of transfer of assembled core complexes from PM to TM, the mechanism by which this transport process occurs is unknown. Coupling PSII biogenesis to the topology of the membrane systems in Synechocystis 6803 will be central to the understanding of the dynamics of the photosynthetic apparatus in these cyanobacterial cells. We thank other members of the Pakrasi laboratory for collegial discussions."

Here we studied the metabolic stability of α-methylspermidine, α-methylspermine, and bis-α-methylspermine, which all have been reported to fulfill many of the putative physiological functions of the natural polyamines. In vivo studies were performed with the transgenic rats overexpressing spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase. α-Methylspermidine effectively accumulated in the liver and did not appear to undergo any further metabolism. On the other hand, α-methylspermine was readily converted to α-methylspermidine and spermidine; similarly, bis-α-methylspermine was converted to α-methylspermidine to some extent, both conversions being inhibited by the polyamine oxidase inhibitor N1, N2-bis(2,3-butadienyl)-1,4-butanediamine. Furthermore, we used recombinant polyamine oxidase, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, and the recently discovered spermine oxidase in the kinetic studies. In vitro studies confirmed that methylation did not protect spermine analogs from degradation, whereas the spermidine analog was stable. Both α-methylspermidine and bis-α-methylspermine overcame the proliferative block of early liver regeneration in transgenic rats and reversed the cytostasis induced by an inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase in cultured fetal fibroblasts.

Both α-methylspermidine and bis-α-methylspermine overcame the proliferative block of early liver regeneration in transgenic rats and reversed the cytostasis induced by an inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase in cultured fetal fibroblasts. Although the requirement of the natural polyamines spermidine, spermine, and their precursor putrescine for the growth of mammalian cells is extremely well documented, their specific functions in proliferative processes are largely unknown (1Ja ̈nne J. Alhonen L. Leinonen P. Ann. Med. 1991; 23: 241-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Some of the published data appear to assign a central role to spermidine, whereas putrescine is supposed to serve as its precursor and spermine as a storage pool convertible back to spermidine. For the elucidation of the physiological roles of individual polyamines, metabolically stable derivatives of polyamines fulfilling their specific cellular functions would be extremely valuable. Methyl derivatives of spermidine and spermine have been used as substitutes for the natural polyamines both in vitro and in vivo. α-Methylspermidine (MeSpd), 1The abbreviations used are: MeSpd, α-methylspermidine; SSAT, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase; PAO, polyamine oxidase; SMO, spermine oxidase; MeSpm, α-methylspermine; Me2Spm, bis-α-methylspermine. 1The abbreviations used are: MeSpd, α-methylspermidine; SSAT, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase; PAO, polyamine oxidase; SMO, spermine oxidase; MeSpm, α-methylspermine; Me2Spm, bis-α-methylspermine. α-methylspermine (MeSpm), and bis-α-methylspermine (1,12-dimethylspermine, Me2Spm) are equally effective as the natural polyamines in inducing the conversion of right-handed B-DNA to left-handed Z-DNA (2Varnado B.L. Voci C.J. Meyer L.M. Coward J.K. Bioorg. Chem. 2000; 28: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition to spermidine and spermine, cytostasis that resulted from the inhibition of the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase can be reversed by MeSpd but not by Me2Spm (3Byers T.L. Lakanen J.R. Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Spermidine, spermine (because of its conversion to spermidine), and MeSpd serve as substrates for the synthesis of deoxyhypusine (an integral part of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A), whereas Me2Spm does not (3Byers T.L. Lakanen J.R. Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the mentioned methylated derivatives of spermidine and spermine have been reported to reverse the cytostasis induced by difluoromethylornithine, a specific inhibitor of mammalian ornithine decarboxylase (4Lakanen J.R. Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). MeSpd appears to undergo slow conversion to MeSpm. Me2Spm has not been reported to be metabolized. MeSpd is not a substrate for spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) (4Lakanen J.R. Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In line with the above studies, we found that MeSpd prevents zinc-induced pancreatitis and restores liver regeneration in transgenic rats overexpressing SSAT under the control of the metallothionein promoter (5Ra ̈sa ̈nen T.L. Alhonen L. Sinervirta R. Keina ̈nen T. Herzig K.H. Suppola S. Khomutov A.R. Vepsa ̈la ̈inen J. Ja ̈nne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39867-39872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Under these conditions where polyamine catabolism was intensely activated, the natural polyamines could not be used as they were rapidly acetylated and degraded with no net tissue accumulation (5Ra ̈sa ̈nen T.L. Alhonen L. Sinervirta R. Keina ̈nen T. Herzig K.H. Suppola S. Khomutov A.R. Vepsa ̈la ̈inen J. Ja ̈nne J. J. Biol.

Here we studied the metabolic stability of the three methylated polyamine derivatives, namely MeSpd, MeSpm, and Me2Spm. Transgenic rats with activated polyamine catabolism because of overexpression of SSAT were used for the experiments in vivo, immortalized fibroblasts derived from the same animals and liver extracts from normal rats were used for experiments in vitro. The metabolisms of these polyamine analogs were also studied by using purified recombinant human polyamine oxidase, human spermine oxidase, and mouse SSAT. We found no evidence indicating that MeSpd would be further metabolized in vivo and the compound was also a poor substrate for the studied enzymes in vitro. Surprisingly, both MeSpm and Me2Spm were catabolized at the methylated ends both in vivo and in vitro although Me2Spm was far more stable. Furthermore, MeSpd and Me2Spm were competitive inhibitors of SSAT. Both MeSpd and Me2Spm restored early liver regeneration in transgenic rats with activated polyamine catabolism, in which a profound spermidine and spermine depletion developed after partial hepatectomy. Although Me2Spm was metabolized to MeSpd to some extent, the restoration of the proliferative activity was attributable to Me2Spm and not to the low contents of MeSpd.

Plasmid expressing SV40 large and small T antigens was a kind gift from Dr. M. J. Tevethia of the Department of Microbiology (Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA). The transgenic cell populations were identified with the aid of the quantitative PCR. The immortalized fibroblasts were plated in 6-well culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum, gentamycin (50 μg/ml; Invitrogen), and geneticin G418 (500 μg/ml; Sigma). The cells were left to adhere for 24 h before the growth medium was replaced with fresh medium and drugs. After the incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, detached with trypsin, counted, and the polyamines were determined after sulfosalisylic acid precipitation from the supernatant fractions with the aid of high performance liquid chromatography. The Back-conversion Studies of the α-Methylated Polyamine Analogs with the Liver Extracts in Vitro—Wild-type Wistar male rats were sacrificed and livers were processed as above. All supernatants were combined and eluted at 4 °C through Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) with a nominal molecular weight limit of 30,000 with high-salt (500 mm NaCl) buffer to remove the natural polyamines. The resulting eluates were desalted in the same columns with non-salt buffer three times to remove excess salt. The final eluates were pooled and the protein concentrations were determined. Experiments were carried out in triplicates where 40 μl of liver extract was used per total reaction volume of 180 μl. Reaction buffer containing 0.1 m glycine-NaOH, pH 9.5, and 5 mm dithiothreitol was used to study the metabolism of the polyamines and their α-methylated analogs in 1 mm concentrations. The reactions were initiated with the studied polyamine or analog addition and the reaction tubes were incubated at 37 °C water bath for 60 min. Five millimolar freshly distilled benzaldehyde was used to decrease the Km values and to increase the reaction velocity of PAO according to Hölttä (12Ho ̈ltta ̈ E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the reaction mixtures were preincubated for 10 min with 250 μm MDL72527 to inactivate PAO before polyamine or analog addition (Table I). The reactions were stopped with the addition of 20 μl of 100 μm diaminohexane in 50% (w/v) sulfosalisylic acid.Table IMetabolism of polyamines and their analogs in rat liver extractsTreatmentPolyamine or analogPutSpdMeSpdSpmpmol/mg proteinLiver extractswithout 1 h + 37 °C incubationND796 ± 271,490 ± 190after 1 h + 37 °C incubation70 ± 45824 ± 681,270 ± 88+ 5 mm BA635 ± 22825 ± 11020 ± 34+ 250 μm MDL7252751 ± 24739 ± 1101,430 ± 120+ 5 mm BA + 250 μm MDL725274 ± 5835 ± 491,270 ± 1101 mmN1-AcSpd18,900 ± 9401,120 ± 1001,520 ± 310+ 5 mm BA15,100 ± 11001,080 ± 2101,190 ± 67+ 250 μm MDL72527NDaND, not detected.1,210 ± 1401,300 ± 74+ 5 mm BA + 250 μm MDL72527ND899 ± 1501,600 ± 931 mm Spd186 ± 24—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.905 ± 78+ 5 mm BA3330 ± 290—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.310 ± 83+ 250 μm MDL 7252744 ± 30—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.876 ± 78+ 5 mm BA + 250 μm MDL725279 ± 10—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.784 ± 511 mm MeSpdND394 ± 10—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.839 ± 130+ 5 mm BA1030 ± 55620 ± 74—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.210 ± 72+ 250 μm MDL72527ND387 ± 9—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.733 ± 54+ 5 mm BA + 250 μm MDL72527ND344 ± 12—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.789 ± 1201 mm SpmND3,140 ± 390—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.+ 5 mm BAND21,000 ± 1700—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.+ 250 μm MDL72527ND397 ± 64—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.+ 5 mm BA + 250 μm MDL72527ND659 ± 39—bThe beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein.1 mm MeSpmND1,830 ± 1703,100 ± 390441 ± 36+ 5 mm BAND6,240 ± 1109,220 ± 270343 ± 25+ 250 μm MDL72527ND735 ± 99ND375 ± 18+ 5 mm BA + 250 μm MDL72527ND568 ± 140ND389 ± 331 mm Me2SpmND744 ± 894,390 ± 6801,110 ± 140+ 5 mm BAND999 ± 6620,400 ± 1,300640 ± 85+ 250 μm MDL72527ND697 ± 81617 ± 32968 ± 120+ 5 mm BA + 250 μm MDL72527ND746 ± 42602 ± 261,050 ± 61a ND, not detected.b The beginning of the reaction polyamine equaled 84,700 pmol/mg protein. Open table in a new tab Production of Recombinant PAO and SMO, Expression Systems—The cDNA coding for the hSMO open reading frame and containing His6 at the N terminus was synthesized by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GAAGGAGATATACATATGCACCATCATCACCATCACATTGAGGGTCGCATGCAAAGTTGTGAATCCAGTGG-3′ and 5′-GAGAAGGTCGTCCCCTGGACTGAGCTCTTCGAACATACG-3′. The cDNA coding for the hPAO open reading frame and containing His6 at the N terminus was synthesized by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GAAGGAGATATACATATGCACCATCATCACCATCACATTGAGGGTCGCATGGAGTCGACCGGCAGCGTC-3′ and 5′-CGGGTCCGGCTCCGAGATCGAGCTCTTCGAACATACG-3′. The PCR fragments were cloned into NdeI/XhoI of the pET 30a vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). Bacteria containing plasmids were cultured and collected according to the Qiagen Qiaexpressionist™ manual and the proteins were purified under native conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His Bind resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both PAO and SMO proteins were further purified with affinity chromatography. For the affinity matrix NHS-activated Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). N8-Acetylspermidine and spermidine were used as ligands for PAO, whereas for SMO, spermidine and Me2Spm were used. The SMO elutes were concentrated and washed with the standard buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) several times using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). PAO, however, could not be concentrated nor washed in a similar way as it bound to the filter membrane very tightly. Desalting of the PAO elutes after affinity chromatography were performed with NAP-10™ gel filtration columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Production of Recombinant SSAT—To obtain the SSAT cDNA (exons one to six) the pool of the first strand cDNA was PCR amplified using primers 5′-TACGTCGACACGAATGAGGAACCACC-3′ and 5′-CTAGCGGCCGCAGGTTGTCATTGTCTAC-3′. The resultant PCR product was gel-purified, restriction enzyme digested, and cloned. For protein expression the coding sequence of SSAT was amplified by PCR using the cloned SSAT cDNA as a template. The primers used are: 5′-TTAGCCATATGCATCATCATCATCATCATGATGACGACGACAAGATGGCTAAATTTAAGATCCG-3′ and 5′-CTACTCGAGCTCACTCCTCTGCTGCC-3′. The upstream primer contained His6 and an enterokinase cleavage site. The NdeI/XhoI-digested PCR products were cloned into the pET 30a vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) and sequenced. For the protein production Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as the host and the recombinant protein was purified under native conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His Bind resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). The kinetic studies of the oxidizing enzymes were performed in duplicates with 4 to 6 different 10 to 1000 μm substrate concentrations. The SMO and PAO reactions were carried out in a total volume of 180 μl in the same buffer as the liver extract reactions and were allowed to proceed for 10 to 30 min at 37 °C before addition of 20 μl of 100 μm diaminohexane in 50% (w/v) sulfosalisylic acid. The kinetic study of SSAT was performed with 100, 400, 700, and 1000 μm spermidine or spermine as a substrate and 100, 400, 700, and 1000 μm MeSpd or Me2Spm as a competitive inhibitor. Determination of Ornithine Decarboxylase, SSAT, PAO Activities, and Polyamines—The activity of ornithine decarboxylase was assayed as described previously (13Ja ̈nne J. Williams-Ashman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1725-1732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SSAT activity was assayed as described in Ref. 14Bernacki R.J. Oberman E.J. Seweryniak K.E. Atwood A. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 847-857PubMed Google Scholar. The PAO activity was assayed essentially as described by Kumazawa et al. (15Kumazawa T. Seno H. Suzuki O. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) using radioactive N1, N11-diacetylnor-spermine, instead of N1-acetylspermine, as the substrate. High performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the concentrations of the polyamines and their methylated analogs essentially as described by Hyvönen et al. (16Hyvo ̈nen T. Keina ̈nen T.A. Khomutov A.R. Khomutov R.M. Eloranta T.O. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 574: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—The data were expressed as mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post-hoc test for multiple comparisons was used for statistical analyses with the aid of a software package, GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Purity of α-Methylated Polyamine Analogs: NMR and High Performance Liquid Chromatography Studies—1H and 13C spectra were recorded on an Avance DRX spectrometer operating at 500.13 MHz. NMR showed >99.5% purity for all studied polyamine analogs. MeSpd, MeSpm, and Me2Spm were further tested with high performance liquid chromatography for typical orthophtalaldehyde reactive impurities. In 10,000 pmol of each sample, the amount of orthophtalaldehyde reactive impurities were less than 50 pmol (results not shown). Stability of the Analogs in the Liver of SSAT Transgenic Rats—Fig. 1A displays the typical polyamine pattern in the liver of SSAT overexpressing rats. Putrescine pool was greatly increased, whereas the spermine level was decreased when compared with wild-type rat liver where putrescine remains almost undetectable (8Alhonen L. Parkkinen J.J. Keina ̈nen T. Sinervirta R. Herzig K.H. Ja ̈nne J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8290-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An exposure of the rats to the polyamine oxidase inhibitor MDL72527 expectedly greatly reduced putrescine content and expanded the pool of N1-acetylspermidine (Fig. 1A). All the analogs accumulated in the liver of the transgenic rats, MeSpd showing the highest tissue concentrations (Fig. 1, A–D). The latter analog likewise appeared to be metabolically stable and, in contrast to an earlier report (4Lakanen J.R. Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found no evidence that MeSpd was converted to MeSpm (Fig. 1B). As indicated in Fig. 1C, MeSpm was effectively converted to MeSpd. The latter conversion was markedly inhibited by the MDL72527 compound (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D shows that also Me2Spm was converted to MeSpd, but to a much lesser extent than MeSpm. The conversion of Me2Spm to MeSpd was totally prevented by MDL72527 (Fig. 1D). Effect of the Analogs on SSAT and PAO Activities in the Liver of SSAT Transgenic Rats—The methylated polyamine analogs did not appear to be very effective inducers of SSAT activity. In fact, only Me2Spm significantly increased the hepatic SSAT activity, which was further enhanced by combining the latter analog with MDL72527 (Fig. 2A). However, the modest induction of the SSAT activity in response to the methylated analogs may be tissue-specific as the analogs much more effectively induced SSAT activity in the pancreas of the transgenic rats (results not shown). The analogs had little effect on PAO activity, whereas the used doses of MDL72527 alone or in combination with the analogs virtually completely inhibited PAO activity (Fig. 2B). All the analogs stimulated ornithine decarboxylase activity to some extent (results not shown). Studies with Liver Extracts Obtained from Wild-type Rats—We used crude liver extracts to study the stability of analogs in vitro under conditions corresponding to the situation in vivo. High-salt extraction was performed (see “Materials and Methods”) to remove or decrease the content of small molecular weight compounds. The extraction procedure certainly removed all acetyl-CoA (and probably also inactivated the labile SSAT protein) thus preventing acetylation of the polyamine substrates during the experiments. We used benzaldehyde supplementation as it is known to greatly enhance PAO activity when nonacetylated spermidine or spermine is used as a substrate (but not when N1-acetylspermidine is used) (12Ho ̈ltta ̈ E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Benzaldehyde in all likelihood forms a Schiff base with the polyamines mimicking the structure and charge distribution of the acetylated polyamines, which are much more preferred substrates for PAO than the unmodified polyamines (12Ho ̈ltta ̈ E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, substantial amounts of spermidine and spermine (but no putrescine) remained in the extracts even after the high-salt procedure. During the 60-min incubation, some putrescine was formed and the production was greatly enhanced upon an inclusion of 5 mm benzaldehyde in the incubation mixture. Interestingly, the formation of putrescine was associated with the disappearance of the endogenous spermine, but not spermidine. However, the view that spermine was directly converted to putrescine was ruled out by tracer studies indicating that labeled spermine was first converted to spermidine followed by the appearance of the label in putrescine (results not shown). Putrescine formation without benzaldehyde addition was probably because of mono- and/or diaminooxidases as we did not use any inhibitors. Inclusion of 1 mmN1-acetylspermidine yielded large amounts of putrescine, the formation of which was not enhanced by benzaldehyde. In fact, the observed slight inhibition in the presence of benzaldehyde could be attributable to the formation N1-acetyl/N8-benzyl-Schiff base-spermidine and N8-acetylspermidine is an inhibitor for PAO (17Ho ̈ltta ̈ E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). MDL72527 prevented any formation of putrescine from N1-acetylspermidine (Table I). In comparison with N1-acetylspermidine, 1 mm spermidine produced relatively little putrescine even in the presence of benzaldehyde, probably because Schiff base can be formed in both primary amino groups of spermidine (N1/N8). Inclusion of 1 mm MeSpd appeared to yield some putrescine in the presence of benzaldehyde, but this putrescine was in all likelihood derived from endogenous spermine (Table I). Exogenous spermine was converted to spermidine even in the absence of benzaldehyde but the conversion was greatly enhanced by the latter compound. Inclusion of 1 mm MeSpm yielded substantial amounts of spermidine and MeSpd already without benzaldehyde, which further enhanced the conversions by a factor of about 3 (Table I). The only product derived from 1 mm Me2Spm was MeSpd, the formation of which was stimulated nearly 5-fold by benzaldehyde. It is interesting to note that Me2Spm was even more effectively converted to MeSpd in the presence of benzaldehyde than was MeSpm. The metabolism of spermine and its methylated derivatives was fully or partially blocked by MDL72527 (Table I). Polyamines and Their Analogs as Substrates for Recombinant SSAT, PAO, and SMO—We also produced purified recombinant mouse SSAT, human PAO, and human SMO to study the substrate specificities of these enzymes. SSAT and SMO purifications yielded very pure enzymes according to SDS-PAGE, whereas purification of PAO resulted in about 80% pure enzyme. However, the contaminating bacterial protein did not have any PAO-like activity (data not shown). Km and Vmax values of spermidine and spermine as substrates for SSAT were 52 μm and 2.4 nmol/min/μg; 33 μm and 0.43 nmol/min/μg, respectively. The Ki value of MeSpd with spermidine as substrate was 144 μm, Ki values of Me2Spm with spermidine and spermine as substrates were 30 μm and 34 μm, respectively. MeSpm was not tested as it could serve as a substrate for SSAT at the unmethylated end. The kinetic values for different analogs are listed in Table II in respect to both recombinant oxidases. PAO strongly preferred N1-acetylspermidine; furthermore, PAO was able to oxidize methylated spermine derivatives, but not MeSpd, to spermidine and MeSpd. In the presence of benzaldehyde, the Km values for PAO decreased and the enzyme readily used spermine and its analogs but not very effectively spermidine or MeSpd, probably because of the inhibitory N8 Schiff base. Spermidine, N1-acetylspermidine, and MeSpd did not serve as substrates for SMO, whereas spermine and its mono- and dimethyl derivatives did. Expectedly, neither oxidase produced spermidine from Me2Spm. Interestingly, the effect of methylation on the kinetic values seems to be opposite for the oxidases; the activity of PAO without benzaldehyde increased with the number of the methyl groups, whereas that of SMO decreased. As a conclusion it seems that α-methylation prevents polyamine derivatives from acetylation but not their oxidation.Table IIKinetic values of recombinant polyamine and spermine oxidasesSubstrateKmVmaxPAOPAO + 5 mM BASMOPAOPAO + 5 mm BASMOμmpmol/μg protein/minN1-AcSpd142859004000Spd15710MeSpd16140Spm479.320340460012000MeSpm19aKinetic values for the unmethylated end.12aKinetic values for the unmethylated end.67aKinetic values for the unmethylated end.530aKinetic values for the unmethylated end.4000aKinetic values for the unmethylated end.2300aKinetic values for the unmethylated end.17bKinetic values for the methylated end.11bKinetic values for the methylated end.34bKinetic values for the methylated end.340bKinetic values for the methylated end.1500bKinetic values for the methylated end.1100bKinetic values for the methylated end.Me2Spm472910090041001400a Kinetic values for the unmethylated end.b Kinetic values for the methylated end. Open table in a new tab Restoration of Early Liver Regeneration in Transgenic Rats Overexpressing SSAT—We have earlier found that partial hepatectomy of the transgenic rats overexpressing SSAT results in a profound spermidine and spermine depletion because of SSAT induction at 24 h postoperatively and failure to initiate liver regeneration (5Ra ̈sa ̈nen T.L.

Keina ̈nen T. Herzig K.H. Suppola S. Khomutov A.R. Vepsa ̈la ̈inen J. Ja ̈nne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39867-39872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Table III shows thymidine incorporation in livers of transgenic rats before and 24 h after partial hepatectomy. As shown, thymidine incorporation remained at the preoperative level at 24 h in untreated rats, whereas small doses (5 mg/kg) of MeSpd only insignificantly increased DNA synthesis. Higher doses (25 mg/kg) of both MeSpd and Me2Spm resulted in about a 10-fold stimulation of DNA synthesis. Table III also lists the hepatic pools of polyamines and their analogs before and after partial hepatectomy. As found earlier, partial hepatectomy brought about profound depletions of the natural polyamines spermidine and spermine at 24 h after the operation in the transgenic rats, whereas the analogs readily accumulated in the liver. N1-Acetylspermidine levels remained unaffected in all animal groups at about 100 pmol/mg of tissue (results not shown). Even though Me2Spm was converted to MeSpd, the hepatic concentration of the latter compound remained clearly below (about half) the level achieved with the smaller dose of MeSpd that failed to stimulate thymidine incorporation (Table III). It thus appears that the observed stimulation of DNA synthesis after Me2Spm was attributable to the spermine derivative and not to MeSpd. In fact, Me2Spm appeared to be even more effective than MeSpd on the molar basis.Table IIIAccumulation of polyamines, their analogs, and thymidine incorporation in regenerating liverTime of regeneration/treatmentPolyaminesThymidinePutSpdMeSpdSpmMe2Spmpmol/mg tissuecpm/g liver0 h1030 ± 951170 ± 140158 ± 455640 ± 80024 h4600 ± 710ap < 0.001.405 ± 91ap < 0.001.45 ± 31ap < 0.001.6210 ± 60024 h + MeSpd (2 × 5 mg)4540 ± 690ap < 0.001.183 ± 47ap < 0.001.462 ± 4118 ± 5ap < 0.001.14600 ± 480024 h + MeSpd (2 × 25 mg)3280 ± 600ap < 0.001.278 ± 130ap < 0.001.1070 ± 23038 ± 29ap < 0.001.60100 ± 22000bp < 0.05 as compared with unoperated animals.24 h + Me2Spm (2 × 25 mg)4300 ± 250ap < 0.001.241 ± 28ap < 0.001.213 ± 982 ± 2ap < 0.001.422 ± 11049800 ± 11000bp < 0.05 as compared with unoperated animals.a p < 0.001.b p < 0.05 as compared with unoperated animals. Open table in a new tab Reversal of Difluoromethylornithine-induced Cytostasis by Bis-α-methylspermine in Immortalized Fibroblasts—We next tested whether difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-induced cytostasis in fibroblasts derived from transgenic fetuses overexpressing SSAT could be reversed with Me2Spm. As shown in Fig. 3, 5 mm DFMO distinctly inhibited cell growth. An addition of 20 μm Me2Spm fully reversed growth inhibition. Polyamine analyses showed that under these conditions, Me2Spm was not converted to MeSpd to any appreciable extent. As also shown in Fig. 3, a combination of Me2Spm with MDL72527 (inhibiting PAO and SMO) equally effectively reversed DFMO-induced growth inhibition (Me2Spm, MDL72527, and their combination did not have any effect on cell growth in the absence of DFMO; results not shown). These results can be understood in terms that Me2Spm fulfills the requirements for the natural polyamines without being converted to MeSpd. The natural polyamines spermidine and spermine are ultimately converted to putrescine via the concerted action of SSAT and PAO. As PAO strongly prefers acetylated polyamines to the unmodified spermidine and spermine, SSAT is generally considered as the rate-controlling enzyme of the back-conversion pathway. However, when working with SSAT-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells we found that SSAT is absolutely necessary for the conversion of spermidine to putrescine, but not for the degradation of spermine to spermidine (19Niiranen K. Pietila ̈ M. Pirttila ̈ T.J. Ja ̈rvinen A. Halmekyto ̈ M. Korhonen V.P. Keina ̈nen T.A. Alhonen L. Ja ̈nne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25323-25328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In fact, the targeted cells appeared to convert spermine to spermidine much more efficiently than did their wild-type counterparts (19Niiranen K. Pietila ̈ M. Pirttila ̈ T.J. Ja ̈rvinen A. Halmekyto ̈ M. Korhonen V.P. Keina ̈nen T.A. Alhonen L. Ja ̈nne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25323-25328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The conversion of spermine to spermidine in the absence of SSAT activity is obviously attributable to a recently discovered oxidase, which, when first cloned, was thought to be PAO (20Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar), but was later identified as a novel flavin-containing spermine oxidase (21Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Unlike PAO, SMO strongly prefers spermine to its acetylated derivatives. Spermidine is not degraded at all, but monoethylspermine is as a good substrate for SMO as is spermine (21Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Wang Y. Murray-Stewart T. Devereux W. Hacker A. Frydman B. Woster P.M. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). SMO, although inhibited to some extent, is much more resistant to the PAO inhibitor MDL72527 (21Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The present results have revealed that both MeSpm and Me2Spm serve as substrates for both PAO and SMO in vivo and in vitro. MeSpm yielded both spermidine and MeSpd, whereas Me2Spm was converted only to MeSpd. Like in the case of MeSpd (4Lakanen J.R. Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it is highly unlikely that doubly methylated spermine would serve as a substrate for SSAT. This view is supported by the findings that in the presence of benzaldehyde in vitro (Table I) Me2Spm was converted to MeSpd much more effectively than MeSpm, whereas in vivo (Fig. 1, C and D), the latter compound yielded many times more MeSpd than its bis-methylated counterpart. The results obtained with crude liver extracts and transgenic animals were largely confirmed with the use of purified recombinant PAO, SMO, and SSAT. Whereas PAO strongly preferred N1-acetylspermidine as a substrate, SMO most effectively degraded spermine, but did not use spermidine or any of its tested analogs as substrates. The methyl derivatives of spermine were readily metabolized by SMO and PAO (in the presence of benzaldehyde) (Table II). PAO did not use MeSpd as a substrate and it was only poorly metabolized when supplemented with benzaldehyde (Table II). The recombinant SSAT studies confirmed that MeSpd and Me2Spm were not acetylated. However, they were competitive inhibitors of SSAT. Our earlier studies with transgenic rats overexpressing SSAT have indicated that partial hepatectomy of these animals resulted in an induction of SSAT and a profound depletion of the hepatic spermidine pool that was associated with failure to initiate liver regeneration (5Ra ̈sa ̈nen T.L. Alhonen L. Sinervirta R. Keina ̈nen T. Herzig K.H. Suppola S. Khomutov A.R. Vepsa ̈la ̈inen J. Ja ̈nne J. J. Biol.

Based on these studies and earlier work indicating that partial hepatectomy rapidly elevates the hepatic spermidine, but not spermine, pool, we assigned a critical role to spermidine in liver regeneration (5Ra ̈sa ̈nen T.L. Alhonen L. Sinervirta R. Keina ̈nen T. Herzig K.H. Suppola S. Khomutov A.R. Vepsa ̈la ̈inen J. Ja ̈nne J. J. Biol.

However, the present results indicated that liver regeneration, as judged by thymidine incorporation, was equally well restored by Me2Spm, even at lower concentrations than required for MeSpd (Table III), indicating that spermidine and spermine may be fully exchangeable in this system. Straightforward interpretation of the experimental results with the transgenic animals are somewhat complicated by the fact that Me2Spm was converted to MeSpd to some extent. However, according to the present results this conversion appeared to be slow yielding insufficient levels of MeSpd for the correction of the polyamine depletion and initiation of liver regeneration (Table III). To minimize Me2Spm conversion to MeSpd, we used cell cultures with low Me2Spm concentration. In cultured cells, DFMO-induced growth inhibition was fully reversed by Me2Spm in the absence of any conversion of the latter compound to MeSpd. The combination of Me2Spm with MDL72527 equally effectively reversed the antiproliferative effect of DFMO thus totally excluding the contribution of MeSpd. These results confirmed the observed restoration of liver regeneration by Me2Spm as directly attributable to a polyamine (spermine) function, as Me2Spm cannot be converted to deoxyhypusine (3Byers T.L. Lakanen J.R. Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our present study shows the necessity of combining in vivo and in vitro methods to indisputably confirm the conclusions drawn in modern biochemical experiments and clearly shows the value of the analogs in the polyamine metabolism studies.

Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrate that COUP-TFI binds to the –129/–114 element (Ad5) of human CYP11B2 promoter. Transient transfection in H295R adrenal cells demonstrated that COUP-TFI enhanced CYP11B2 reporter activity. However, the reporter construct with mutated Ad5 sequences showed reduced basal and COUP-TFI-enhanced activity, suggesting that binding of COUP-TFI to Ad5 is important for CYP11B2 transactivation. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of COUP-TFI-mediated activity, we subsequently screened for COUP-TFI-interacting proteins from a human adrenal cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified Ubc9 and PIAS1, which have small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1) conjugase and ligase activities, respectively. The coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that COUP-TFI forms a complex with Ubc9 and PIAS1 in mammalian cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that Ubc9 and PIAS1 are markedly expressed in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells. Coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 synergistically enhanced the COUP-TFI-mediated CYP11B2 reporter activity, indicating that both proteins function as coactivators of COUP-TFI. However, sumoylation-defective mutants, Ubc9 (C93S) and PIAS1 (C351S), continued to function as coactivators of COUP-TFI, indicating that sumoylation activity are separable from coactivator ability. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that ectopically expressed COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 were recruited to an endogenous CYP11B2 promoter. Moreover, reduction of Ubc9 or PIAS1 protein levels by small interfering RNA inhibited the CYP11B2 transactivation by COUP-TFI. Our data support a physiological role of Ubc9 and PIAS1 as transcriptional coactivators in COUP-TFI-mediated CYP11B2 transcription.

Aldosterone is exclusively produced in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells due to its unique expression of aldosterone synthase cytochrome P450 (CYP11B2), the enzyme required for the final steps of aldosterone biosynthesis. In aldosterone-producing adrenal cortical adenomas of patients with primary aldosteronism, overexpression of CYP11B2 is demonstrated at the transcriptional level (1Ogishima T. Shibata H. Shimada H.

(Copenh.). 1993; 128: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the reason for aberrant expression of CYP11B2 in these adenomas is not known, mutations in the CYP11B2 gene do not appear to be the cause (3Takeda Y. Furukawa K. Inaba S. Miyamori I. Mabuchi H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 1633-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Pilon C. Mulatero P. Barzon L. Veglio F. Garrone C. Boscaro M. Sonino N. Fallo F. J. Clin.

We therefore postulated that transcription factors and/or coregulators may play important roles in CYP11B2 overexpression in the tumors. The trans-acting factors that regulate CYP11B2 expression remain poorly defined.

In addition, other transcription factors that are expressed in the adrenal cortex include the NGFI-B family of orphan nuclear receptors, such as Nurr1, NGFI-B, and NOR-1. The NGFI-B family receptors are highly expressed in the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells as well as in aldosterone-producing adenomas (8Bassett M.H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol.

These three nuclear receptors are rapidly induced early response genes that enhance transcription by binding to a consensus sequence, named NBRE-1, as well as an Ad5 element of the hCYP11B2 promoter. In addition, CREB and ATF-1 enhance transcription of the hCYP11B2 gene by binding to a CRE (9Bassett M.H. White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol. Cell.

The COUP-TFI was originally identified as an activator of the chicken ovalbumin gene (14Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 15Wang L.H. Tsai S.Y. Cook R.G. Beattie W.G. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1989; 340: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar); however, COUP-TFs mostly function as transcriptional repressor of many target genes. COUP-TFs inhibit the transcription of other nuclear receptor such as retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor (14Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Furthermore, COUP-TFI represses basal transcriptional activity by active repression utilizing transcriptional corepressors, such as N-CoR and SMRT (16Shibata H. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We and other investigators have previously demonstrated that COUP-TFI and SF-1 regulate the bovine CYP17 expression in a mutually exclusive manner (17Bakke M. Lund J. Mol.

We have previously reported that COUP-TFI is expressed in the normal adrenal cortex and that expression levels of COUP-TFI is inversely correlated with those of CYP17, but correlated with those of N-CoR in adrenal cortical adenomas (18Shibata H.

We, therefore, have screened COUP-TFI-interacting proteins from a human adrenocortical adenoma cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified Ubc9 (24Kobayashi S. Shibata H. Kurihara I. Yokota K. Suda N. Saito I. Saruta T. J. Mol.

The SUMO post-translationally modifies many proteins with roles in diverse processes, including regulation of transcription, chromatin structure, and DNA repair (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G.

Rather, similar to non-proteolytic roles of ubiquitin, SUMO modification regulates protein localization and activity. The SUMO E1-activating, E2-conjugating enzymes, and E3-ligase are involved in the sumoylation machinery. In contrast to the ubiquitin system where dozens of E2 enzymes have been identified, Ubc9 is the only known SUMO-E2-conjugating enzyme. Several SUMO-E3 ligases have been identified that promote transfer of SUMO from E2 to specific substrates. To date, three unrelated proteins have been suggested to have SUMO-E3 ligase activity; the protein inhibitors of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) proteins (31Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol.

The present study described that both Ubc9 and PIAS1 can function as transcriptional coactivators of COUP-TFI for the hCYP11B2 gene transcription in a sumoylation-independent manner. These proteins are shown to form a complex in the nucleus and exhibit a very unique localization in the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells. We demonstrated here that COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 are recruited to an endogenous CYP11B2 promoter, thus contributing to aldosterone biosynthesis in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells. Plasmid Constructs—Several COUP-TF constructs, such as pG-BKT7-COUP-TFI, pGBKT7-COUP-TFI-(55–315), pGBKT7-COUP-TFI-(86–183), pGBKT7-COUP-TFI-(150–183), pGBKT7-COUP-TFI-(315–423), pGBKT7-COUP-TFI-(55–423), pRSV-COUP-TFI, pRSV-COUP-TFIΔ35, pDsRed-COUP-TFI, and pGBKT7-COUP-TFII were described previously (16Shibata H.

Several other constructs, including pG-BKT7-Ubc9, pGADT7-Ubc9, pcDNA3.1/His-Ubc9, pcDNA3.1/His-Ubc9 (C93S), pcDNA3.1/His-Ubc9-(1–58), and pAS1cyh2-TRβ-(168–456) were described previously (16Shibata H.

Several PIAS1 fragments, such as PIAS1-(1–651), -(1–150), -(1–300), -(1–405), -(301–651), -(406–651), and -(5–73/564–651), were subcloned into pGADT7 vector using a PCR amplification with primers containing oligonucleotide linkers of restriction enzyme sites (Fig. 1B). Mutagenesis of PIAS1 was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the mutant PIAS1 (C351S) was generated. pEGFP-PIAS1 and pEGFP-PIAS1 (C351S) were generated utilizing PCR amplifications from pGADT7-PIAS1 and pGADT7-PIAS1 (C351S), respectively. Cloning of Ubc9 and PIAS1 by a Yeast Two-hybrid System—Yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted with a MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 3 kit (Clontech) and COUP-TFI (amino acids 55–423) as bait. A human adrenocortical adenoma cDNA library was prepared as shown previously (24Kobayashi S. Shibata H. Kurihara I. Yokota K. Suda N. Saito I. Saruta T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Yeast strain AH109 containing pGBKT7-COUP-TFI-(55–423) was transformed with a human adrenocortical adenoma cDNA library in pGADT7 (Clontech) and plated on synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan, adenine, leucine, and histidine. His+ and Ade+ colonies exhibiting β-galactosidase activity by filter lift assay were further characterized according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). β-Galactosidase activity was determined with chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (16Shibata H. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Kobayashi S. Shibata H. Kurihara I. Yokota K. Suda N. Saito I. Saruta T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To recover the library plasmids, total DNA from the yeast was isolated with a Zymoprep™ yeast plasmid Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) and used to transform Escherichia coli (HB101) in the presence of ampicillin. To ensure that the correct cDNAs were identified, the library plasmids isolated were transformed into Y187 containing pGBKT7-COUP-TFI-(55–423), and β-galactosidase activity was determined. The specificity of the interaction of #2–3 (PIAS1-(5–651)) and #2–4 (Ubc9-(1–158)), both part of the 20 positive clones, with COUP-TFI was determined by mating with Y187, which contains pGBKT7-lamin (Clontech). The β-galactosidase activities of these diploids were examined by the filter lift and chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside methods. The sequence of the #2–3 and #2–4 clones was identical to the GenBank™-submitted sequence of PIAS1 and Ubc9, respectively. The yeast two-hybrid system was also used to determine protein-protein interaction between COUP-TFI/COUP-TFII/Ad4BP/DAX-1/TRβ and these clones. Western Blot Analysis and Coimmunoprecipitation—The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and Western blots were performed before the immunoprecipitation (IP) steps to confirm protein expression by corresponding antibodies as described previously (24Kobayashi S. Shibata H. Kurihara I. Yokota K. Suda N. Saito I. Saruta T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The same samples for the Western blots were diluted to 1 ml in IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 ng/μl aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Tween 20) and precleared with protein G plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and antibodies were added for 1 h. Immune complexes were adsorbed to protein G plus-agarose beads and washed four times in IP buffer. Proteins were then separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were rabbit polyclonal anti-COUP-TFI antibody (generous gift by Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai) (15Wang L.H. Tsai S.Y. Cook R.G. Beattie W.G. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1989; 340: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and the antibodies used for the Western blots were anti-COUP-TFI, anti-Xpress (Invitrogen), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-Ubc9 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), anti-PIAS1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-α-tubulin (Oncogene Research Product) antibodies. Fluorescence Imaging—The images of EGFP-tagged Ubc9 and DsRed-COUP-TFI were described previously (24Kobayashi S. Shibata H. Kurihara I. Yokota K. Suda N. Saito I. Saruta T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors of pEGFP-PIAS1, and pDsRed-COUP-TFI. Live cell microscopy of GFP fusion and DsRed fusion proteins was performed on a confocal microscope (Axiovert 100M, Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.). Imaging for GFP and DsRed was performed by excitation with 488 and 543 nm, respectively, from an argon laser, and the emissions were viewed through band passes ranging from 500 to 550 nm, and 550 to 600 nm, respectively, by band pass regulation with LSM510 (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.). All images were processed as TIFF (tagged image file format) files on Photoshop 7.0 using standard image-processing techniques. Northern Blot Analysis—The human tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were hybridized at 42 °C overnight with 32P-labeled cDNA probes of the full-length 1.1-kb hUbc9, 1.9-kb hPIAS-1, full-length 1.3-kb hCOUP-TFI, or 1.1-kb glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Clontech) cDNAs according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membranes were washed at a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC-0.1% SDS at 50 °C and analyzed with a BAS 3000 image scanner (Fuji Film Co.). The mRNA levels were determined by comparison with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels. Immunohistochemistry—Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6 μm, and mounted on silane-coated slides. For immunohistochemistry, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, followed by blocking endogenous peroxidase using 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxidase in phosphate-buffered saline, which were then subjected to microwave antigen retrieval in 0.01 m citrate buffer. Thereafter, they were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with a blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. They were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted appropriately with the blocking solution. Primary antibodies for immunohistochemistry included rabbit anti-COUP-TFI, anti-Ubc9 (BD Biosciences, Pharmingen), anti-PIAS1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After two washes in phosphate-buffered saline, immunoreactivities were detected using a Vectastatin ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, CA) and a Vecta DAB substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). As negative controls, sections were incubated with the preimmune or control serum in place of the primary antibody. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (8Bassett M.H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol.

Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe by electrophoresis (2 h) on a 4% polyacrylamide, 2.5% glycerol gel using 1× TGE as running buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 38 mm glycine, 2.7 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). For detection of supershift complex, anti-SF-1 (a generous gift of Dr. Ken-ichirou Morohashi) and anti-COUP-TFI (a generous gift of Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai) antibodies were used. Mammalian Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—H295R cells, derived from human adrenocortical carcinoma cells (8Bassett M.H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), were used for luciferase assays. H295R cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.5% NuSerum (Collaborative Bio, Bedford, NA) and 1% ITS (insulin-transferrin-selenium) culture supplement (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours before transfection, 1 × 105 cells per well of a 24-well dish were plated in the medium. All transfections into H295R cells were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with indicated amounts of expression plasmids, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and cell extracts were assayed for both Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities with a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Relative luciferase activity was determined as ratio of Firefly/Renilla luciferase activities, and data are expressed as the mean (±S.D.) of triplicate values obtained from a representative experiment that was independently repeated at least three times. RNA Interference—H295R cells transfection with siRNAs, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (8Bassett M.H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12Clyne C.D. Zhang Y. Slutsker L. Mathis J.M. White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol.

H295R cells were plated into 24-well plates, grown until reaching 70–80% confluence, and transfected with 30 pmol of negative control sequence, Ubc9-, or PIAS1-specific siRNA duplex using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously as follows: siRNA Ubc9a sense, 5′-GGC CAG CCA UCA CAA UCA ATT-3′; siRNA Ubc9a antisense, 5′-UUG AUU GUG AUG GCU GGC CTC-3′; siRNA Ubc9b sense, 5′-GGA ACU UCU AAA UGA ACC ATT-3′; siRNA Ubc9b antisense, 5′-UGG UUC AUU UAG AAG UUC CTG-3′; siRNA PIAS1a sense, 5′-GGU CCA GUU AAG GUU UUG UTT-3′; siRNA PIAS1a antisense, 5′-ACA AAA CCU UAA CUG GAC CTG-3′; siRNA PIAS1b sense, 5′-GGU UAC CUU CCA CCU ACA ATT-3′; siRNA PIAS1b antisense, 5′-UUG UAG GUG GAA GGU AAC CTG-3′; and Silencer Negative Control #1 siRNA (Ambion) were used. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP assay was performed as described previously (38Shiio Y. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13225-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The cross-linked, sheared chromatin solution was used for immunoprecipitation with 3 μg of anti-COUP-TFI, anti-Xpress antibody, anti-FLAG antibody, or normal IgG. The immunoprecipitated DNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, precipitated by ethanol, and amplified by PCR using primers flanking the human CYP11B2 Ad5 region (–335 to –52 from the transcription initiation site) or 3′-untranslated region (1939–2198 from the transcription initiation site): CYP11B2 Ad5 sense primer: 5′-CCT CTC ATC TCA CGA-3′ (–335/–321) and CYP11B2 Ad5 antisense primer: 5′-AAC CTG CTC TGG AAA-3′ (–66/–52); CYP11B2 control sense primer: 5′-CAT TAA GCG GGA TCC-3′ (1939/1953) and CYP11B2 control antisense primer: 5′-CAA GAC CTG GTC CAT-3′ (2184/2198). DNA samples with serial dilution were amplified by PCR to determine the linear range for the amplification (data not shown). Statistics—All experiments were performed in triplicate several times. The error bars in the graphs of individual experiments correspond to the S.D. of the triplicate values. Identification of Ubc9 and PIAS1 as COUP-TFI-interacting Proteins by Yeast Two-hybrid System—To search for proteins that might regulate the activity of the COUP-TFI, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with COUP-TFI encoding amino acids 55–423 as bait and a cDNA library prepared from a human adrenocortical adenoma as described previously (24Kobayashi S. Shibata H. Kurihara I. Yokota K. Suda N. Saito I. Saruta T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this manner, we identified a full-length"

UCN-01 is such a compound that overrides the G2 cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage and forces cells into a deleterious mitosis. The molecular pathways leading to mitotic cell death are largely unknown although recent evidence indicates that mitotic cell death represents a special case of apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that the mitotic spindle checkpoint is activated upon chemotherapeutic treatment with topoisomerase II poisons and UCN-01. Cells that are forced to enter mitosis in the presence of topoisomerase inhibition arrest transiently in a prometaphase like state. By using a novel pharmacological inhibitor of the spindle checkpoint and spindle checkpoint-deficient cells we show that the spindle checkpoint function is required for the mitotic arrest and, most importantly, for efficient induction of mitotic cell death. Thus, our results demonstrate that the mitotic spindle checkpoint is an important determinant for the outcome of a chemotherapy based on the induction of mitotic cell death. Its frequent inactivation in human cancer might contribute to the observed resistance of tumor cells to these chemotherapeutic drugs.

Its frequent inactivation in human cancer might contribute to the observed resistance of tumor cells to these chemotherapeutic drugs. The mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint prevents the onset of anaphase as long as a single chromosome is unattached to the mitotic spindle, thus ensuring proper chromosome alignment and chromosomal stability. Several proteins, including Mad1, Mad2, Bub1, BubR1, Bub3, and Mps1, which are specifically recruited to unbound kinetochores upon checkpoint activation, are required for the spindle checkpoint (1Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Spindle-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs like taxanes (e.g. paclitaxel and docetaxel) and various Vinca alkaloids (e.g. vinblastine and vincristine) are frequently used in the clinic and activate the spindle checkpoint leading to a transient mitotic arrest (2Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). Upon prolonged spindle damage, however, cells undergo apoptosis, which represents the final outcome of chemotherapy. Significantly, spindle checkpoint defects are frequently observed in human cancer including breast, colon, lung, ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinomas (3Wang X. Jin D.Y. Ng R.W. Feng H. Wong Y.C.

Interestingly, these defects have recently been associated with resistance to spindle damaging chemotherapeutic drugs (8Sudo T. Nitta M. Saya H. Ueno N.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2502-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Masuda A. Maeno K. Nakagawa T. Saito H. Takahashi T. Am. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5187-5193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another large group of routinely used chemotherapeutics are various topoisomerase II poisons (e.g. etoposide/VP16, adriamycin/doxorubicin). These agents are thought to cause DNA damage and induce cell cycle arrest followed by the induction of cell death. While the cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase depends on p53, a G2 arrest can also occur in p53-deficient cells (11Shapiro G.I. Harper J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A novel strategy for tumor therapy selectively targeting p53-deficient tumor cells is the drug-mediated inactivation of the G2 cell cycle arrest. UCN-01, which has successfully completed phase I clinical trials, is such a compound that abrogates potently the G2 arrest in p53-deficient tumor cells (12Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Treatment with UCN-01 induces mitotic entry in the presence of topoisomerase inhibition and greatly enhances cell death. Therefore, entry into mitosis in the presence of DNA damage appears to be an important determinant for chemotherapy outcome, but the mechanisms of the induction of mitotic cell death are not defined (13Tse A.N. Schwartz G.K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Bunch R.T. Eastman A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 791-797PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Gö6976, a compound similar to UCN-01, was also shown to potently abrogate the G2 arrest, and it was proposed to be a promising G2 cell cycle checkpoint abrogator for clinical studies (16Kohn E.A. Yoo C.J. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 31-35PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—HCT116, HCT116-p53–/– (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore) (17Bunz F.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6845-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed and semidry westernblotting was performed as described (19Vogel C. Kienitz A. Hofmann I. Muller R. Bastians H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6845-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) using the following antibodies: anti-PARP 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. (Pharmingen), anti-actin (Sigma), secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Flow Cytometry—For FACS analyses DNA was stained using propidium iodide, and the mitotic index was determined by staining for the MPM2 epitope following procedures as described (19Vogel C. Kienitz A. Hofmann I. Muller R. Bastians H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6845-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells were counted as cells containing a sub-G1 DNA content and were verified by staining apoptotic nuclei with DAPI. Microscopy—Cells were fixed for 10 min in 1% p-formaldehyde/PHEM (60 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 27 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgSO4) and permeabilized in 1% Chaps/PHEM for 10 min. Anti-CREST (Europa Bioproducts), anti-Bub1, anti-BubR1 (kind gifts from Dr. Stephen Taylor, Manchester, UK), donkey anti-sheep antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and donkey anti-human antibodies conjugated to RedX (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were applied for 2 h at room temperature. DNA was stained for 5 min with 1 μg/ml Hoechst. Mitotic Cell Death Is Associated with the Activation of the Spindle Checkpoint—We wished to investigate whether the spindle checkpoint is involved in mitotic cell death induced by chemotherapeutic treatment. Treatment of p53-deficient human colon carcinoma cells (HCT116-p53–/–) with adriamycin resulted in a cell cycle arrest in G2 before entry into mitosis (data not shown). Consistent with previous work (12Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), addition of UCN-01 abrogated the G2 arrest and increased the proportion of mitotic cells in p53 deficient but not in wild-type cells within a short time interval (Fig. 1A). We noted that cells, which were forced to enter mitosis by treatment with UCN-01, accumulated in mitosis in a time-dependent manner, and this was not significantly further enhanced by treatment with nocodazole (data not shown). This observation raised the possibility that the mitotic spindle checkpoint might be activated when cells enter mitosis upon topoisomerase inhibition before cell death occurs. To test this, we determined the localization of Bub1 and BubR1 in cells treated with adriamycin and UCN-01. Clearly, cells arrested in a prometaphase-like state with condensed and unaligned chromosomes and both, Bub1 and BubR1, were co-localized with CREST at kinetochores, demonstrating an activated spindle checkpoint (Fig. 1B). Thus, cells arrest before anaphase in a spindle checkpoint-dependent manner in response to topoisomerase poison and UCN-01 treatment. The Indolocarbazole Compound Gö6976 Is a Potent Inhibitor of the Mitotic Spindle Checkpoint—In a recent report, Gö6976, an indolocarbazole compound structurally similar to UCN-01, was found to be a similarly potent abrogator of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint (16Kohn E.A. Yoo C.J. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 31-35PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we identified Gö6976 in an independent screen for inhibitors of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. 2A. Kienitz, C. Vogel, R. Müller, and H. Bastians, manuscript in preparation. Gö6976, but not UCN-01, potently overrides the spindle checkpoint-mediated mitotic arrest in response to nocodazole or taxol (Fig. 2A). Significantly, when applied to asynchronously growing cells, Gö6976 greatly inhibited spindle checkpoint dependent accumulation of mitotically arrested cells in response to nocodazole without causing disturbation of the cell cycle per se (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Thus, both UCN-01 and Gö6976 are inhibitors of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint; however, Gö6976 is the first potent pharmacological spindle checkpoint inhibitor that can be used as a tool to convert asynchronously growing wild-type cells into spindle checkpoint-compromised cells. The Spindle Checkpoint Is Required for Mitotic Cell Death Induced by Topoisomerase Poison and UCN-01 Treatment— The identification of Gö6976 as an abrogator of the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest and as a potent inhibitor of the spindle checkpoint allowed us to ask whether the spindle checkpoint is involved in topoisomerase poison induced mitotic arrest and cell death. We treated HCT-p53–/– cells with adriamycin and either UCN-01 or Gö6976. As expected, both inhibitors, but not adriamycin alone, greatly enhanced the mitotic index within short time intervals. Consistent with the observation that Gö6976 acts as a potent inhibitor of the spindle checkpoint, the mitotic arrest in Gö6976-treated cells was compromised (Fig. 2C). Most significantly, entry into mitosis was associated with the induction of cell death and this was clearly diminished in cells treated with Gö6976 (Fig. 2D). To demonstrate that Gö6976 efficiently overrides the G2 checkpoint and drives cells through mitosis without a prolonged mitotic delay or arrest we determined the DNA content after 24 and 48 h of treatment. We found that Gö6976 treatment grossly induces endoreduplication and only a small proportion of cells showed a 4 n DNA content typical for G2 cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2, E and F). Similarly, endoreduplication is typically observed in spindle checkpoint-compromised cells upon a premature exit from mitosis (19Vogel C. Kienitz A. Hofmann I. Muller R. Bastians H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6845-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Taken together, by using a novel pharmacological inhibitor of the spindle checkpoint we showed that the spindle checkpoint is required for a mitotic arrest and for an efficient induction of cell death in response to topoisomerase poison treatment. Spindle Checkpoint-compromised Cells Escape from Topoisomerase Poison-induced Apoptosis—To directly address whether the spindle checkpoint is required for topoisomerase poison-induced apoptosis, we used HCT116 and isogenic cells in which one allele of the spindle checkpoint gene MAD2 had been deleted (HCT-MAD2+/–). As shown before (18Michel L.S. Liberal V. Chatterjee A. Kirchwegger R. Pasche B. Gerald W. Dobles M. Sorger P.K. Murty V.V. Benezra R. Nature. 2001; 409: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), MAD2+/– cells are spindle checkpoint-defective as indicated by a dramatically reduced mitotic arrest in response to spindle damage (Fig. 3A). In response to topoisomerase poison treatment MAD2+/– cells arrested initially in G1 and G2 similar to wild-type cells indicating functional DNA damage checkpoint pathways in these cells (Fig. 3B). In agreement with previous studies (13Tse A.N. Schwartz G.K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), prolonged inhibitor treatment results in an adaption of the DNA damage checkpoint, escape from the cell cycle arrest, entry into mitosis, and induction of cell death. Therefore, we treated HCT-wild-type and the isogenic spindle checkpoint-compromised derivatives with different concentrations of adriamycin or 5-fluoruracil for prolonged time intervals and determined the rate of apoptosis. As expected, we found an induction of cell death in response to topoisomerase poison treatment in wildtype cells. However, cell death was significantly impaired in spindle checkpoint-compromised cells (Fig. 3C, left panels). The escape from apoptosis was verified by determining the cleavage of PARP, a general and specific parameter of apoptosis (Fig. 3C, right panel). In contrast, we found no significant difference in the rate of apoptosis in both isogenic cell lines upon 5-fluoruracil treatment (Fig. 3D) and UV irradiation (data not shown) indicating that spindle checkpoint-compromised cells are not defective in apoptosis per se. Similarly, the escape from apoptosis was also observed in spindle checkpoint-compromised cells upon treatment with etoposide/VP-16, another frequently used topoisomerase II poison (Fig. 3E). UCN-01, which has successfully completed phase I clinical trials, is a promising anti-cancer drug that is used in combination with DNA-damaging agents to induce mitotic cell death (11Shapiro G.I. Harper J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 12Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 13Tse A.N. Schwartz G.K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the induction of mitotic cell death is a major determinant for the chemotherapy outcome, the underlying molecular pathways are largely unknown. Most recently, it has been shown that the activation of caspase-2 and caspase-3 and the permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane are associated with mitotic cell death indicating that it might represent a special case of apoptosis (20Castedo M. Perfettini J.L. Roumier T. Valent A. Raslova H. Yakushijin K. Horne D. Feunteun J. Lenoir G. Medema R. Vainchenker W. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4362-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the mitotic cell death induced by topoisomerase poisons and UCN-01 is preceded by a prolonged and spindle checkpoint-mediated mitotic arrest. Moreover, the mitotic spindle checkpoint is required for the induction of mitotic apoptosis suggesting that the activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint associated with a prolonged mitotic arrest is a prerequisites for triggering mitotic cell death. Similarly, we and others (9Masuda A. Maeno K. Nakagawa T. Saito H. Takahashi T. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1109-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) 3A. Kienitz, C.

Indeed, spindle checkpoint defects in human tumors have been correlated with resistance to paclitaxel (8Sudo T. Nitta M. Saya H. Ueno N.T.

From our studies, it is expected that spindle checkpoint-compromised tumors are resistant not only toward spindle-damaging drugs like paclitaxel, vinblastine, and vincristine but also to therapies based on the induction of mitotic cell death-like treatments using UCN-01 in combination with topoisomerase poisons. Thus, the status of the mitotic spindle checkpoint is likely to represent a major determinant for the clinical outcome of these chemotherapeutic treatments. Furthermore, the inactivation of the spindle checkpoint in tumor cells might contribute directly to an acquired resistance to these cancer therapies. Our findings places the mitotic spindle checkpoint into a central position of the apoptotic cell death pathways induced by spindle-damaging agents and topoisomerase poisons. It is unknown how the spindle checkpoint triggers the apoptotic response, but it is tempting to speculate that molecules such as survivin that is involved in both, spindle checkpoint activation and apoptosis, might mediate the cross-talk between mitotic spindle checkpoint activation and induction of apoptosis (21Lens S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2013413064,"The role of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases in cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and other responses makes them attractive therapeutic targets. The activation of PKCs by ligands in vivo varies depending upon cell type; therefore, methods are needed to screen the potency of PKCs in this context. Here we describe a genetically encoded chimera of native PKCδ fused to yellow- and cyan-shifted green fluorescent protein, which can be expressed in mammalian cells. This chimeric protein kinase, CY-PKCδ, retains native or near-native activity in the several biological and biochemical parameters that we tested. Binding assays showed that CY-PKCδ and native human PKCδ have similar binding affinity for phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Analysis of translocation by Western blotting and confocal microscopy showed that CY-PKCδ translocates from the cytosol to the membrane upon treatment with ligand, that the translocation has similar dose dependence as that of endogenous PKCδ, and that the pattern of translocation is indistinguishable from that of the green fluorescent protein-PKCδ fusion well characterized from earlier studies. Treatment with phorbol ester of cells expressing CY-PKCδ resulted in a dose-dependent increase in FRET that could be visualized in situ by confocal microscopy or measured fluorometrically. By using this construct, we were able to measure the kinetics and potencies of 12 known PKC ligands, with respect to CY-PKCδ, in the intact cell. The CY-PKCδ chimera and the in vivo assays described here therefore show potential for high throughput screening of prospective PKCδ ligands within the context of cell type.

PKCs are activated by the second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) or by their ultrapotent analogues, the phorbol esters. Because PKCs activate downstream cellular pathways that regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and other responses, they are important therapeutic targets. Indeed, a number of compounds targeting protein kinase C are currently at different stages of drug development. Examples include LY333531, being evaluated for diabetic retinopathy and anti-angiogenesis (1Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya D. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.E. Kern T.S. Ballas L.M. Heath W.F.

The known isoforms of protein kinase C include the classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are calcium-dependent; the novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), which are calcium-independent, and the atypical PKCs (ζ and ι), which are not activated by DAG or the phorbol esters (8Newton A.C.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The classical and novel PKCs each contain one or more highly conserved C1 domains, zinc finger motifs that act as the binding site for DAG and the phorbol esters (10Hurley J.H. Newton A.C.

Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Biochemical assays of PKC activation have limited predictive value for the understanding of structure-activity relationships because of extensive modulation of PKC behavior by the cellular environment, which includes contributions from lipids, calcium, and cellular binding proteins and differences in the ability of different potential drugs to penetrate the cell membrane and activate the kinases (12Szallasi Z.

Bull. 1990; 24: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, assays that can be performed with intact cells to measure PKC activation are urgently needed. Genetically encoded fluorescent proteins that undergo changes in fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) are a powerful tool for in situ visualization of intracellular events and are increasingly finding application in high throughput screening (HTS) of potential drugs. These include indicators for the second messengers calcium (14Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y.

Sensors that are activated by protein kinases, and therefore indicative of protein kinase activity, have also been developed. These sensors generally consist of portions of a kinase substrate fused to a fluorescent protein in an arrangement such that a conformational change occurs upon phosphorylation, resulting in a change in FRET. These sensors include phocuses (17Sato M. Ozawa T. Inukai K. Asano T. Umezawa Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) as well as downstream pseudosubstrates for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (18Nagai Y. Miyazaki M. Aoki R. Zama T. Inouye S.

Examples are modified protein kinase B/Akt (22Calleja V. Ameer-Beg S.M. Vojnovic B. Woscholski R. Downward J. Larijani B. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and modified MAPK2 (23Neininger A. Thielemann H. Gaestel M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we describe a genetically encoded fusion of native protein kinase Cδ with flanking CFP and YFP peptides. This chimeric protein kinase retains near-native binding affinity and cellular translocation activity; treatment of cells expressing this chimeric protein kinase results in a dose-dependent change in FRET that can be visualized in situ or measured fluorimetrically in a high throughput format. By using this chimera, we were able to analyze the in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 12 well characterized PKC ligands. Materials—PMA, dPP, thymeleatoxin, prostratin, phorbol 12,13-diacetate (diC2), phorbol 12,13-dipropionate (diC3), PDBu, and phorbol 12,13-dihexanonate (diC6) were obtained from LC Services Corp. (Woburn, MA). Ingenol 3-angelate was from Peplin Ltd. (Newstead, Queensland, Australia). Bryostatin 1 was a gift from G. R. Pettit, Arizona State University. Phorbol 12,13-dioctanoate (diC8) and phorbol 12,13-dinonanoate (diC9) were synthesized as described previously (24Wang Q.J. Fang T.W. Fenick D. Garfield S. Bienfait B. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12136-12146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). [3H]PDBu was obtained from American Radiochemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Enzymes for molecular cloning and PCR were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Invitrogen, or Roche Applied Science. Primers were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Culture, Bacterial Strains, Transfection, and Transformation— CHO-K1 cells (CCL 61) were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in F-12K medium adjusted to contain 1500 mg/liter of sodium bicarbonate (ATCC, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cultured cells were grown to 90% confluence prior to transfection. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. All experiments were performed the day following transfection. Escherichia coli DH5α-MCR was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium either in broth or on agar. Kanamycin was used in LB medium at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Recombinant DNA transformation of E. coli was done according to the heat-shock protocol (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY2001: 1.116-1.118Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids—The mouse PKCδ gene was excised from pGFP-PKCδ (26Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pECFP-N1 (Clontech), creating pCFP-PKCδ. The EYFP gene was amplified from pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) using forward and reverse primers that incorporated NheI and XhoI sites, respectively, and the amplicon was introduced into pCFP-PKCδ, creating pCY-PKCδ. The clone was verified by triplicate sequencing of the insert (DNA minicore, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Molecular Biology Methods—Plasmid DNA was purified chromatographically using commercial kits from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). PCRs were performed using PfuUltra high fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Binding of [3H]PDBu—[3H]PDBu binding was measured by using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay developed by our laboratory (27Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 129-156PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human PKCδ was obtained from Invitrogen, whereas CY-PKCδ was expressed in CHO-K1 cells and purified by immunoprecipitating with mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) and protein A/G-agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The assay mixture (250 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 4 mg/ml bovine IgG, and variable concentrations of [3H]-PDBu. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min. Samples were chilled on wet ice for 5 min followed by the addition of 200 μl of 35% polyethylene glycol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The samples were incubated on wet ice for another 10 min. The tubes were centrifuged at 12,400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 100-μl aliquots of the supernatant were pipetted into scintillation vials for the determination of the free concentrations of [3H]PDBu, and the pellets were carefully dried. The tips of the centrifuge tubes, containing the pellets, were excised and transferred to scintillation vials for quantitation of the total bound [3H]-PDBu. CytoScint ES (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) was added to all scintillation vials prior to counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by using an excess (40 μm) of nonradioactive PDBu. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. In a typical binding assay, seven concentrations of [3H]PDBu were used. The KD value for the ligand was calculated via nonlinear multiple regression to the binding Equation 1,[BL=Bmax⋅LKD+L](Eq. 1) where BL represents the concentration of bound [3H]PDBu; L is the concentration of free [3H]PDBu; Bmax is the theoretical maximum receptor occupancy, and KD is the dissociation constant. Values represent the mean of triplicate experiments, as indicated, with triplicate determinations of each point in each experiment. Dose-response Curves as Measured Fluorimetrically—CHO-K1 cells were grown in T-75 flasks and transfected as described above. The day after transfection, cells were washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized for <1 min, and collected in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm glucose. The suspension was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min; the supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in the same buffer. The cell suspension was pipetted into a cuvette for each series of measurements at each ligand concentration. Ligand was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the cell suspension in a 1:100 dilution. Fluorescence was measured using a FluoroMax-3 fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon Horiba, Edison, NJ) that was kept at 37 °C with a circulating water bath. Samples were excited at 433 nm, and the emission ratio was measured as the ratio of emission at 474 nm to emission at 527 nm after correction for background fluorescence by the ligand. The change in emission ratio for each concentration of ligand was determined as the emission ratio following exposure to drug minus the emission ratio prior to exposure. Dimethyl sulfoxide alone was demonstrated to have no effect on the emission ratio. The fractional response, Y, for each time point was calculated as the change in emission ratio at that concentration of ligand, divided by the change in emission ratio after addition of the highest concentration of ligand used. These data were fit to two different equations. First, the fractional response, Y, for the assay end points was plotted as a function of free ligand and fitted by Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear regression to the Hill Equation 2,[Y=11+(ED50L)n](Eq. 2) where Y is the fractional response as described above; L is the concentration of free ligand, and n is the Hill coefficient. Values represent the mean of triplicate experiments as indicated. Second, the kinetic data, consisting of fractional response, Y, as a function of time t and of ligand concentration L, were fitted by Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear regression to the association kinetic Equation 3,[Y=BLBmax=LED50+L⋅(1−e−(L+ED50)kt)](Eq. 3) where Y represents the fractional effect; L represents the free ligand concentration; ED50 is the ligand concentration yielding half-maximal effect, and k is a rate constant (28Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors: Models for Binding, Trafficking, and Signaling. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 133-180Google Scholar). Because we are describing the rate and potency of biological effect, we have used the term ED50 in place of KD and k in place of kon. Analysis of Membrane Translocation—Western blotting and subsequent analysis were performed as described previously (29Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, cultured CHO-K1 cells were treated with varying concentrations of PMA diluted in Me2SO. Following treatment, cells were washed, harvested into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor mixture (500 μm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 500 μm EDTA, 1 μm E-64, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) from Calbiochem, collected with a cell scraper, and lysed by sonication. Total cell lysates were fractionated by ultracentrifugation. The soluble (cytosolic) fraction represents the supernatant after a 1-h centrifugation at 200,000 × g. The Triton X-100 soluble (membrane) fraction was prepared by a 1-h extraction of the pellet with the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by sonication and centrifugation for 1 h at 200,000 × g. The protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Blotting of membranes was performed using rabbit anti-PKCδ polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-PKCα polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science). Following washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), developed with ECL Western blot detecting reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed to film. Bands were quantitated densitometrically using Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). In a typical membrane translocation assay, five concentrations of ligand were used. Values for each point represent the average value for that concentration obtained from triplicate experiments. The ED50 for the ligand was calculated using nonlinear multiple regression to the Hill equation (Equation 2). Visualization by Confocal Microscopy—Cultured cells were grown on 0.17-mm Delta T dishes (Bioptechs, Inc., Butler, PA) and transfected the next day as described above. Prior to observation, the cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red, supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. The temperature was kept steady at 37 °C throughout all experiments. Fluorescent cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 imaging system (Carl Zeiss Inc, Thornwood, NY) with an Axiovert 100M inverted microscope operating with a 25-milliwatt argon laser tuned to 458 nm. Cells were imaged with a 63 × 1.4 NA Zeiss Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective. Images were collected using a single track configuration where the yellow and cyan emission was split with an NFT 515 dichroic filter and collected in PMT 1 with a LP 530 filter and PMT 2 with a BP 465-505 filter, respectively. FRET was visualized as the ratio of the image collected through PMT1 over that collected through PMT2. Prior to the calculation of the ratio, pixels from both images with intensities less than 4% of saturation were removed by a threshold function. Construction of CY-PKCδ—The docking of ligand with PKC is thought to lead to a change in PKC tertiary structure such that the pseudosubstrate region of PKC is released from the catalytic site of the enzyme. Provided this conformational change sufficiently altered the spatial alignments of, or distance between the N and C termini, we might be able to monitor the ligand binding in the cellular environment by a change in FRET using a chimeric fusion of PKC flanked by YFP and CFP at the N and C termini, respectively. Therefore, we cloned the PKCδ coding sequence into the plasmid vector pECFP-N1, forming pCFP-PKCδ. The EYFP gene was then cloned into pCFP-PKCδ. The resulting plasmid, pCY-PKCδ, was analyzed by restriction digestion and sequencing to verify that the construction was successful. Verification That CY-PKCδ Behaves Like Wild-type PKCδ in Intact CHO Cells—A potential problem with the PKC fusion construct is that the addition of the CFP and YFP at the N and C termini might affect the cellular behavior of the PKC or its binding of phorbol ester or DAG. Three approaches were used to assess this issue. First, we compared the in vitro binding affinities of [3H]PDBu to CY-PKCδ and to human PKCδ (Invitrogen). CY-PKCδ was isolated from transfected CHO cells by immunoprecipitation; binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The KD value obtained for CY-PKCδ was 0.98 ± 0.37 nm (n = 3) and for human PKCδ it was 0.52 ± 0.05 nm (n = 4) (Fig. 1). These KD values indicate that CY-PKCδ exhibits a binding affinity similar to that of wild-type PKCδ. Second, we qualitatively and quantitatively examined the dose-dependent translocation of CY-PKCδ and the endogenous PKCδ from the soluble fraction to the membrane fraction. CHO cells transfected with CY-PKCδ were treated with five concentrations of PMA, incubated for 20 min, harvested, and fractionated into cytosolic and membrane fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A 20-min incubation time with PMA had been shown to be sufficient to observe translocation of PKCδ but not so long as to induce down-regulation of PKCδ expression (29Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions were analyzed via SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-PKCδ or anti-GFP antibodies. Treatment with PMA induced roughly similar translocation of endogenous PKCδ and the CY-PKCδ from the cytosolic fraction to the membrane fraction, as illustrated for a representative experiment (see Fig. 2). There was, however, more CY-PKCδ present in the membrane fraction of the control (Me2SO-treated) cells than was the case for the endogenous PKCδ, and the highest concentration of PMA caused full translocation of endogenous PKCδ but not of CY-PKCδ (see Fig. 2A). A possible explanation for this difference is the level of overexpression of the exogenous CY-PKCδ. In order to compare quantitatively the sensitivity of translocation of the CY-PKCδ and the endogenous PKCδ in response to ligand, the Western blots were analyzed densitometrically, and the average extents of translocation (three experiments) were plotted as a function of PMA concentration, and ED50 values were determined using the Hill equation as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see Fig. 2). The ED50 values agreed with a factor of 2, and for endogenous PKCδ, ED50 = 328 ± 59 nm, and for CY-PKCδ, ED50 = 637 ± 183 nm. Third, we examined the pattern of translocation of CY-PKCδ. The kinetics of translocation and final cellular destination of translocated PKC vary depending upon the ligand and the PKC isozyme; this is especially noted with PKCδ (24Wang Q.J. Fang T.W.

Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to confirm that the kinetics of translocation of CY-PKCδ were similar to that of the GFP-PKCδ protein that is typically used in translocation studies. By using confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found that the real time translocation kinetics and cellular localization of GFP-PKCδ and CY-PKCδ following treatment with PMA were indistinguishable (n = 4 experiments) (see Fig. 3). Characterization of FRET Signal in Intact Cells by Fluorimetry—Binding of ligand to CY-PKCδ and its subsequent activation is expected to induce a change in protein conformation, potentially altering the spatial relationship between the N-terminal YFP and C-terminal CFP fluorophores. This would be measurable as a change in FRET. We wished to quantify the change, if any, in FRET and to determine whether a relationship could be drawn between change in FRET and ligand concentration. We performed spectral analysis of CHO cells expressing CY-PKCδ prior to and 10 min following treatment with 1 μm PMA, using an excitation wavelength of 433 nm. A noticeable decrease in the CFP peak (λ = 474 nm) and an increase in the YFP peak (λ = 527 nm) indicated an increase in FRET (see Fig. 4). We determined real time changes in FRET by continually measuring the ratio of emission at 527 nm over emission at 474 nm during treatment of the cells with 1 μm PMA. The emission ratio increased quickly after addition of PMA and reached a plateau within 5 min (see Fig. 4). Measurement of FRET over a time period of up to 30 min did not yield a further change in the emission ratio (data not shown). We next determined the extent of the change in FRET as a function of PMA concentration. The changes in FRET were measured after 5 min at various PMA concentrations, and, based on end point measurements, a dose-response curve was generated (Fig. 5A) that fit the Hill equation and yielded a value for ED50 of 283 ± 27 nm (n = 4). Because we were using whole cell assays, binding of free ligand to surfaces, as well as partitioning to cellular membranes, could deplete the concentration of free ligand and cause artifacts in our results. To verify that this was not occurring, we performed assays with radioactive [3H]PDBu under comparable conditions. In these assays, the concentration of free ligand, determined by scintillation counting, dropped by 1% or less after incubation with cells (data not shown), indicating that the free ligand concentration remained in excess of the receptor concentration. Characterization of the FRET Signal by Confocal Microscopy— Visualization of changes in FRET within the cell may potentially allow us to resolve the sequence of events associated with PKCδ activation. CHO cells transfected with the CY-PKCδ plasmid were used for these experiments. We examined the ratio of emission through the YFP channel over emission through the CFP channel when cells were excited via a 458-nm laser line. Our results confirmed FRET activity, which initially was most apparent at the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 3, B and C, 5-min time points) and subsequently became evident throughout the internal membranes (Fig. 3, B and C, 15- and 30-min time points). These results are consistent with published data showing that PMA traverses cell membranes slowly (12Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27159-27162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Murphy T.V. Prountzos C. Kotsonis P. Iannazzo L. Majewski H. Eur. J.

Kinetic Analysis of CY-PKCδ-Ligand Interaction in Vivo— The CY-PKCδ construct allowed us to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of phorbol esters in CHO cells. We chose a total of 12 PKC ligands for this analysis. Six of these ligands were chosen because either they were well characterized or were in clinical trials; these were prostratin, dPP, bryostatin 1, ingenol 3-angelate, PMA, and thymeleatoxin. The remaining six ligands comprised a homologous series of symmetric phorbol 12,13-diesters that provided a range of lipophilicities with which we could invest"

For example, NCX1 plays a critical role in muscle contraction in the heart, whereas NCKX1 plays an important role in phototransduction in the outer segments of retinal rod photoreceptors. Both NCX and NCKX are bidirectional transporters that can mediate Ca2+ influx or Ca2+ efflux from cells, depending on the transmembrane Na+ gradient (NCX) or the transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients (NCKX). The ion transport pathways in both NCX and NCKX are thought to be associated with two sets of membrane-spanning segments (TMs) that are separated by a large cytosolic loop. The two TMs contain the so-called α1 and α2 repeats, respectively, thought to have arisen from an early gene duplication event (3Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The α repeats are the only regions of sequence conservation between members of the NCX and NCKX gene families, and are thought to be in antiparallel orientation for both NCX1 (4Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Individual substitution of most of the residues conserved between NCX and NCKX results in a large decrease in or even loss of cation transport function (7Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S.

The key distinguishing feature between NCX and NCKX is that the latter requires and transports K+ and a stoichiometry of 4Na+: 1Ca2+ + 1K+ has been reported for NCKX1 and NCKX2 (9Schnetkamp P.P.M.

Most studies have reported a 3:1 coupling ratio for the NCX1 Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, although in a few studies a 4:1 ratio has been advocated as well (reviewed in Refs. 12Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J.

In a previous study we identified two acidic residues (Asp258 and Asp575) thought to be located deep within membrane-spanning helices and important for NCKX function, which do not appear to have similarly placed counterparts in the NCX topology (8Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here, we show that mutagenesis of the codon for Asp575 in the human NCKX2 cDNA results in mutant NCKX2 proteins that were no longer dependent on K+ as judged by their ability to carry out K+-independent Ca2+ influx representing reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis and Expression Systems—Mutagenesis of the short splice variant of the Myc-tagged human retinal cone NCKX2 cDNA (AAF25811) was carried out as described before (8Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The codon of the Asp575 residue was replaced by codons for either asparagine, cysteine, or glutamic acid. The mutant NCKX2 cDNAs were placed in either the pEIA vector for expression in an insect cell line (High Five cells) or in the pCDNA3.1 vector for expression in a mammalian cell line (HEK293 cells). Cell culture and transfection protocols were as described before (8Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Kang K.-J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9438-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).HEK293 cells were used for functional studies using electrophysiological methods and using the fluorescent Ca2+-indicating dye Fluo-3, whereas High Five cells were used for functional studies using a 45Ca uptake assay. High Five cells can be grown in roller bottles and showed highly uniform protein expression levels for wild-type NCKX2 and NCKX2 mutants compared with HEK293 cells (8Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Kang K.-J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9438-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). High Five cells were less suited for the fluorescence measurements because of fast leakage of Fluo-3 from the cells. High Five cells were less appropriate for electrophysiological recordings because they showed a propensity for quickly developing large leak currents that limited the time available for useful measurements and reduced the number of high resistance seals successfully obtained.Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells transfected with either wild-type NCKX2 cDNA or with Asp575 NCKX2 mutant cDNAs were collected in a medium containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.4 with arginine). The cells (0.5 ml volume) were placed in the recording chamber and allowed to settle for ∼45 min on a poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslip at the bottom of the chamber. The recording chamber was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 25, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and viewed under phase-contrast optics. Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchange currents were recorded using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Pipettes were prepared from glass capillaries (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) using a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Model P87/PC, Sutter Instrument); pipettes had a resistance of 3–7 megohm when back-filled with pipette solution. The seal resistance ranged between 5 and 10 Gohm. Currents were recorded with an L/M-EPC-7 amplifier (List-Medical, Darmstadt, Germany). Reverse Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchange currents were recorded in conventional whole cell configuration using a holding potential of 0 mV. Current traces were displayed using Axotape software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), after digitizing the analogue signals at 0.5 kHz (DigiData 1200, Axon Instruments). Current records were filtered at 10 Hz. Data were analyzed off-line using pCLAMP (Axon Instruments), and a technical graphics/analysis program (ORIGIN, MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). An eight-channel perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments Inc, Westbury, NY) was used to apply test solutions to the selected cell. Solution changes were completed in ∼20 ms. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Changes in current were normalized with respect to cell size as judged from cell capacitance; the average capacitance of 70 cells examined in this study was 8.2 ± 0.9 pF (average ± S.E.).At the start of each experiment, the HEK cells in the recording chamber were in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.4 with arginine), and 10 mm glucose. After the Gohm seal was formed, the recording chamber was superfused with a medium containing 150 mm LiCl, 10 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.4 with Tris) at a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min. To activate reverse exchange currents, the bath solution containing 150 mm LiCl, 10 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.4 with Tris) was rapidly changed for one containing 0.2 mm CaCl2 (replacing 1 mm EDTA) and selected concentrations (0–150 mm) of KCl, maintaining osmotic strength by replacing LiCl with KCl. In some experiments for reverse exchange current recordings, selected concentrations of free Ca2+ were obtained with the use mixtures of CaHEDTA and HEDTA (diluted from 200 mm stock solutions adjusted to pH 7.4 with arginine). The pipette filling solution contained 130 mm sodium glutamate, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgATP, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.2 with Tris).Functional Analyses: Fluo-3 Measurements in HEK293 Cells and 45Ca Uptake in High Five Cells—In addition to electrophysiological characterization of the Asp575 NCKX2 mutants, we used two other functional assays developed in our laboratory to measure NCKX function. NCKX-mediated changes in cytosolic-free [Ca2+] were measured with the fluorescent Ca2+-indicating dye Fluo-3 in HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA encoding wild-type NCKX2 or NCKX2 mutants as described in detail before (14Kang K.-J.

Briefly, High Five cells were Na+-loaded with the ionophore monensin and the ionophore was removed through washing with bovine serum albumin-containing solutions. 45Ca was measured with liquid scintillation counting after 45Ca taken up the by High Five cells was separated from 45Ca remaining in the medium by a rapid filtration method using borosilicate glass fiber filters.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMembers of the NCX and NCKX gene families have been shown to carry out either Ca2+ efflux or Ca2+ influx depending on the direction of the transmembrane Na+ gradient (NCX) or the transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients (NCKX) (1Quednau B.D.

Physiol. 2004; 447: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx in exchange for intracellular Na+ is readily observed upon removal of extracellular Na+ and is referred to as reverse exchange. Reverse exchange has proven to be a very convenient way to carry out functional analyses of heterologously expressed NCX and NCKX proteins. For example, the extracellular Ca2+ and K+ dependences of NCKX-mediated transport are readily determined from reverse exchange (10Szerencsei R.T. Prinsen C.F.M. Schnetkamp P.P.M.

We have previously characterized functional consequences of individual substitutions of a large number of residues (>100) in the human NCKX2 protein (8Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G.

For all but one of the NCKX2 mutants examined so far, the strict requirement for extracellular K+ was retained although maximal transport rates (8Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J.

The human NCKX2 sequence contains only four acidic residues thought to be located well within membrane-spanning helices and conserved among the NCKX1–5 genes. The position of these residues is shown in Fig. 1A. Glu188 and Asp548 are also conserved in the three NCX genes, while Asp258 does not have a similarly placed counterpart in the NCX sequence. The NCKX2 Asp575 residue is adjacent to a short stretch of residues conserved between NCX and NCKX, but the three NCX genes contain the codon for asparagine at this position (Fig. 1B). Here, we describe that substitution of the Asp575 residue renders the heterologously expressed mutant NCKX2 protein K+ independent as determined by three independent assays.Fig. 1Topology of NCKX2 and location of transmembrane acidic residues.A, NCKX2 sequence contains eleven hydrophobic segments (1Quednau B.D.

Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25919-25928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Sheng J.-Z. Prinsen C.F.M. Clark R.B. Giles W.R. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, the K+ dependence of reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange currents was examined in HEK293 cells expressing either wild-type NCKX2, D575N mutant NCKX2 or D575C mutant NCKX2. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with cDNA encoding (mutant) NCKX2 and cDNA encoding GFP (at a 10:1 mass ratio). GFP fluorescence was used to select for successfully transfected cells, and, indeed, all of the cells identified this way showed reverse NCKX currents when an adequate seal was obtained. This was true for wild-type NCKX2 and for the two Asp575 mutant NCKX2 examined, suggesting that the transfection efficiencies for GFP, for wild-type and for Asp575 mutant NCKX2 were the same. Conversely, NCKX currents were never observed in cells that did not express GFP.Cells expressing either the D575C or the D575N NCKX2 mutant proteins showed significant Ca2+-activated reverse exchange currents in the absence of any extracellular K+ (Fig. 2). Increasing extracellular K+ did not result in a clear increase in reverse exchange current. In contrast, cells expressing wild-type NCKX2 showed a strong dependence of reverse exchange current on extracellular K+ as reported before (11Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25919-25928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Sheng J.-Z. Prinsen C.F.M. Clark R.B. Giles W.R. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). No K+-independent and Ca2+-activated reverse exchange current was observed in cells expressing wild-type NCKX2. Cells expressing wild-type NCKX2 showed a transient current profile in high KCl medium with an initial peak current followed by a sag to a much smaller current, and this pattern was more pronounced as the initial NCKX2 current was larger. The time course of the decline in current became faster as the EGTA concentration in the pipette-filling solution was lowered, suggesting that NCKX-mediated current rapidly (seconds) changed submembrane Ca2+ concentration and reduced the driving force (data not shown). Clearly, the reverse exchange currents observed in cells expressing either the D575N or the D575C NCKX2 mutant were significantly smaller than currents observed in cells expressing wild-type NCKX2. The average current densities observed were: cells expressing wild-type NCKX2: 9.9 ± 4.0 pA/pF (n = 11); cells expressing the D575N mutant: 1.4 ± 0.4 pA/pF (n = 10); cells expressing the D575C mutant: 1.6 ± 0.5 pA/pF (n = 10) (average current density ± S.E. for n cells; the average cell capacitance was ∼8 pF, see “Experimental Procedures”).Fig. 2K+-independent Na+/Ca2+ exchange currents carried by the D575N and D575C NCKX2 mutant proteins. Patch clamp recordings of reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange currents were made in HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated NCKX cDNA using the whole cell configuration as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” A, typical current recordings are shown of a cell expressing either wild-type NCKX2 (top trace), the D575N NCKX2 mutant (middle trace), or the D575C NCKX2 mutant (bottom trace) when the indicated protocol of solution switches was applied. B, the average current densities are shown normalized to the current densities observed in the 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2 medium. The number of cells is indicated in parentheses, and error bars represent S.E. The maximal reverse exchange current densities observed were: 9.9 ± 4.0 pA/pF (11Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J.

Prinsen C.F.M. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6009-6015Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J. Biol.

When extracellular free [Ca2+] was lowered to 3 μm in the absence of extracellular K+, a significant reverse exchange current could still be observed in cells expressing either of the two Asp575 NCKX2 mutants and this is consistent with the high Ca2+ affinity of NCKX2. No current was observed for cells expressing wild-type NCKX2 under this condition (no extracellular K+).Fluorometric Measurement of Na+/Ca2+ Exchange in HEK Cells Expressing the Asp575 Mutants—The functional activity of the three Asp575 mutants in HEK293 cells was also measured with a fluorometric assay after loading cells with the intracellular fluorescent Ca2+-indicating dye Fluo-3 as detailed elsewhere (16Kang K.-J. Kinjo T.G. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6823-6833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Kinjo T.G. Szerencsei R.T. Winkfein R.J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7940-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells, loaded with Fluo-3, were placed in a cuvette containing a buffered 150 mm LiCl solution with EDTA and HEDTA present. The fluorescence of the cells was stable under these conditions indicating that no changes in cytosolic free [Ca2+] occurred in this medium. Next, reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange (Ca2+ influx) was initiated by raising free [Ca2+] in the cuvette to 10.8 μm and the ensuing increase in Fluo-3 fluorescence was measured either in the LiCl medium or in the LiCl medium to which 20 mm KCl was added. For cells expressing wild-type NCKX2 the Ca2+ addition only resulted in a large Fluo-3 signal in the presence of 20 mm KCl, whereas a small and fast signal (i.e. within the mixing time of the Ca2+ addition) was observed in the LiCl medium without KCl (Fig. 3). The large Fluo-3 signal observed in the presence of KCl represented a rapid increase in cytosolic free [Ca2+] due to K+-dependent reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange. The small signal observed in LiCl medium without KCl was caused by the small amount of Fluo-3 leaked from the HEK cells into the external medium. As a separate control, the experiment was repeated in high NaCl medium, a standard condition to inhibit reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange (17Szerencsei R.T. Tucker J.E. Cooper C.B. Winkfein R.J. Farrell P.J. Iatrou K. Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 669-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As observed in the LiCl medium, Ca2+ addition to cells in the NaCl medium only led to the small instantaneous signal caused by the leaked dye. The signals representing dye leakage varied somewhat between different batches of Fluo-loaded cells and increased over time. The Ca2+-induced amplitude of the Fluo-3 signals observed in cells transfected with wild-type NCKX2 were normalized with respect to the maximal fluorescence signal observed after the cell membrane was permeabilized by addition of saponin (0.02%) in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 to saturate Fluo-3 fluorescence. This value (about 42% in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3) ranged between 30 and 50% in different transfection experiments, similar to the percentage of GFP-positive cells observed in the electrophysiological recordings (see above), which indicates the percentage of successfully transfected cells. Resting free [Ca2+] in the HEK293 cells prior to activation of reverse exchange was quite low and close to minimal fluorescence as obtained by addition of saponin in the presence of 0.1 mm EDTA.Fig. 3K+-independent Na+/Ca2+ exchange by the D575N and D575C NCKX2 mutants. Wild-type NCKX2 and the D575C, D575N, and D575E NCKX2 mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells and transport function was examined with the Fluo-3 assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” 50 ml of Fluo-3-loaded HEK293 cells in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 6 mm d-glucose, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, and 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, were added to a cuvette containing 1.95 ml of the media described below. Sulfinpyrazone is an anion transporter inhibitor, which may reduce leakage of Fluo-3 from the cells. Assay media contained either 150 mm LiCl (black trace), 150 mm LiCl plus 20 mm KCl (green trace), or 150 mm NaCl (red trace) in addition to 20 mm Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.4 with arginine), 6 mm d-glucose, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm HEDTA. At 10 s, CaHEDTA was added to a final concentration of 8 mm to initiate reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange. HEDTA and CaHEDTA were added from 200 mm stock solutions adjusted to pH 7.4 with arginine. The amplitude of the Ca2+-induced Fluo-3 signals were normalized with respect to the fluorescence signal observed when 0.02% saponin was added in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2. Saponin caused the release of Fluo-3 into the external medium and saturated Fluo-3 f"

We have shown previously that αPIX (Cool-2 or ARHGEF6), a Rac1/Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), binds to β-parvin/affixin and colocalizes with integrin-linked kinase in actively spreading cells, suggesting that αPIX is involved in integrin-induced signaling leading to activation of Rac1/Cdc42. Here we report calpain 4, the small subunit of the proteases μ-calpain and m-calpain, as a novel binding partner of αPIX. This association was identified by the CytoTrap system and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. The αPIX triple domain SH3-DH-PH was found to be required for calpain 4 binding. During integrin-dependent spreading of CHO-K1 cells, αPIX colocalized with μ- and m-calpain, integrin-linked kinase, and β1 integrin in early integrin-containing clusters. Overexpression of αPIX wild type but not the GEF-deficient mutant (L386R/L387S) resulted in enhanced formation of characteristic cellular protrusions during cell spreading, suggesting that αPIX GEF activity is necessary for this specific actin cytoskeletal reorganization. The calpain inhibitors calpeptin and calpain inhibitor IV significantly inhibited integrin-dependent cell spreading. However, concomitant overexpression of αPIX wild type or the L386R/L387S mutant restored cell spreading. Together, these data suggest that αPIX is a component of early integrin clusters and plays a dual role in integrin-dependent cell spreading. Whereas αPIX GEF activity contributes to enhanced formation of cellular protrusions, the GEF-independent association with calpain 4 leads to induction of a yet unknown signaling cascade resulting in cell spreading.

All these mechanisms involve changes in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Interaction of cells with the ECM is mediated by transmembrane receptors termed integrins. Binding of integrins to components of the ECM induces clustering of these receptors that subsequently results in the intracellular recruitment of structural and signaling molecules at the sites of matrix attachment, thereby providing links to the actin cytoskeleton (1Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar, 2Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar).Upon activation of integrins via ECM engagement, regulation of the actin cytoskeletal dynamics occurs primarily via the Rho family of small GTPases, i.e. Cdc42, Rac, and Rho (3Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases function as binary switches that cycle between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form (4van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar, 5Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). In particular, activation of Rho increases cell contractility and leads to the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers (3Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 6Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Cdc42 and Rac activation propagates the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia, and peripheral membrane ruffles as well as focal contacts/complexes (7Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D.

The regulated activation of Rho GTPases by growth factor receptors and G protein-coupled receptors has been studied extensively (9Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Considerably less is known about how the ECM acts as an insoluble stimulus of the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Recent studies provide evidence that members of the Rho family of GTPases are activated after signaling through integrins and are involved in integrin-induced cell spreading (10Barry S.T. Flinn H.M.

However, the upstream and downstream signaling pathways of Rho GTPases need to be defined in detail.Activation of Rho GTPases depends on the regulated action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Vav2, an exchange factor for Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA (14Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), has been shown to be necessary for integrin-dependent activation of Rac leading to lamellipodia formation in fibroblasts (15Marignani P.A. Carpenter C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that GEFs are also involved in integrin-induced activation of Rho GTPases. αPIX/Cool-2/ARHGEF6, an exchange factor for Rac1 and Cdc42 (16Bagrodia S.

Moreover, αPIX stimulates platelet-derived growth factor-induced peripheral spreading of Xenopus mesoderm aggregates on fibronectin, suggesting a role of αPIX in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading (18Yoshii S.

Moreover, GIT1/p95PKL is critically involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal changes that accompany integrin engagement with the ECM as well as subsequent cell spreading and motility (23West K.A. Zhang H. Brown M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. Riedy M.C. Horwitz A.F. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Other molecules that play a role in integrin-induced signaling are the intracellular, Ca2+-dependent calpain proteases with the two major forms μ-calpain and m-calpain, both consisting of a large catalytic and a small regulatory subunit (24Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar, 25Sato K. Kawashima S. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 743-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 80-kDa catalytic subunits of the μ- and m-forms are encoded by different genes, whereas the 28-kDa regulatory subunit, calpain 4, is common to both forms. Recent data suggest that calpain activity is regulated during signaling pathways leading to cell adhesion, spreading, and motility (26Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A.

Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Moreover, calpain is required for the formation of a new type of integrin complex that induces, by yet unknown means, the generation of focal complexes and adhesions during integrin-induced cell spreading (28Kulkarni S.

The interaction of β-parvin with αPIX and colocalization of αPIX and ILK during cell spreading suggested an involvement of αPIX in integrin-induced signaling, which in turn results in cytoskeletal rearrangements via the GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (32Rosenberger G.

In the present study, we identified calpain 4, the regulatory subunit of both μ- and m-calpain, as an αPIX-interacting protein. We show that αPIX regulates integrin-mediated cell spreading in a GEF-dependent and -independent manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid ScreeningWe used the yeast two-hybrid system CytoTrap (Stratagene), also designated Sos Recruitment System (36Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), to identify αPIX-interacting proteins. Therefore, αPIX was fused to the N-terminal 1070 residues of human SOS and used as bait. We screened a human fetal brain plasmid cDNA library (Stratagene) with 5.3 × 106 primary colonies and an average insert size of 1.3 kb according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prey cDNAs were fused to the myristoylation signal of v-Src that anchors the fusion proteins to the plasma membrane. All yeast transformations were done by the standard lithium acetate method. First, yeast strain cdc25H was cotransformed with pSos-αPIX together with pYES-mGAP to reduce isolation of Ras GTPase false positive clones (37Aronheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3373-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For the CytoTrap screening, the pretransformed cdc25H yeast strain (see above) was transformed with 3 μg of pMyr-cDNA library plasmids. Resulting transformants were grown for 5 days at 22 °C on selective minimal glucose plates (complete supplement mixture-LEU-URA-TRP). After replica plating onto selective minimal galactose plates, a total of 54 colonies of ∼2 million transformants showed galactose-dependent growth under restrictive conditions. Plasmid DNA was isolated, transformed into Escherichia coli DH10B, and selected on 50 ng/μl chloramphenicol for the presence of the cDNA insert-containing pMyr plasmid. Protein interactions of putatively positive colonies were confirmed by retransformation of the cdc25H yeast strain with both the cDNA-containing pMyr plasmid and pSos-αPIX or empty pSos (negative control). Only those clones growing on galactose media at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C after 6 days were defined as “true” positives. Cotransformation of cdc25H cells with pSos-MafB and pMyr-target cDNA, pSos and pMyr-target cDNA, pSos-MafB and pMyr-Lamin C, pSos and pMyr, pSos-αPIX and pMyr-Lamin C, and pSos-αPIX and pMyr served as negative controls, whereas cotransformation of cdc25H cells with pSos-MafB and pMyr-MafB served as a positive control.In subsequent yeast two-hybrid experiments, different domains of αPIX were tested for interaction with calpain 4, using various bait constructs (see “Plasmid Constructs”) in combination with plasmid pMyr-calpain 4 as prey. Expression of Sos-αPIX fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting of yeast lysates with mouse monoclonal anti-Sos1 antibody (1:400; BD Biosciences) and HRP-conjugated antimouse antibody (1:5000; Amersham Biosciences).For data base searches, we used the NCBI BLAST Network Service. Deduced protein sequences were searched for functional domains using PROSITE and SMART. GenBank accession numbers are AF207831 and D25304 for the αPIX sequence and NM_001749 for calpain 4.Plasmid ConstructsαPIX Constructs Used as Bait in CytoTrap—Full-length and various αPIX constructs were established by using specific PCR primers and the KIAA0006 clone as template, and PCR products were ligated unidirectionally into pSos (Stratagene) via SalI and NotI restriction sites.Generation of N-terminal HA-tagged αPIX Constructs—Various HA-tagged αPIX constructs were generated by using specific PCR primers and the KIAA0006 clone as template, and PCR products were purified and cloned as NotI-EcoRI fragments in eukaryotic expression vector pMT2SM-HA. αPIX ΔDH was generated by PCR-mediated cloning. Two overlapping PCR products lacking the DH domain were amplified and applied to megaprime PCR. The αPIX L386R/L387S construct was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (38Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Mutations of these two residues abolish GEF activity in αPIX (39Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Two overlapping cDNA fragments were amplified with the desired mutations and applied to megaprime PCR.Generation of N-terminal FLAG-tagged Calpain 4 Construct—The calpain 4 coding region was amplified from human testis cDNA (Invitrogen), and the purified PCR product was cloned into “donor vector” pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided. The DNA insert was sequenced for integrity and pENTR/D-TOPO-calpain 4 was used for cloning the calpain 4 coding region into pFLAG-CMV-4-cassetteA (32Rosenberger G. Jantke I. Gal A. Kutsche K. Hum.

Genet. 2003; 12: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) via LR reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol.Generation of N-terminal GST-tagged Calpain 4 Construct—pENTR/D-TOPO-calpain 4 was used for cloning the coding region of calpain 4 into Gateway pDEST27 vector (Invitrogen) via LR reaction.All described constructs were sequenced for integrity, and large and pure amounts of plasmid DNA were prepared by using a plasmid midi or maxi kit (Qiagen). Primer sequences are available on request.CoimmunoprecipitationsCHO-K1 cells were cultured in 100-mm culture dishes in nutrient mixture F-12 (HAM) containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). 1.2 × 106 CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV-4-calpain 4 (6 μg of DNA) or with pFLAG-CMV-4-cassetteA (negative control) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After a 24-h incubation, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 tablet Complete Mini protein inhibitor mixture/10 ml (Roche Applied Science), and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin), and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were applied to 50 μl of EZview Red anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl) and subjected together with total lysates to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Proteins were detected using HRP-conjugated murine monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:4000; Sigma) or rabbit anti-PIX antibody (1:400) (17Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1: 5000; Amersham Biosciences).GST Fusion Affinity PrecipitationsCHO-K1 cells cotransfected with pDEST27-calpain 4 (5 μg of DNA) and various pMT2SM-HA-αPIX constructs (5 μg of DNA) were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 75 μl of GST-Bind Resin (CN Biosciences Novagen) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently washed three times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Precipitates were eluted from the beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE together with total lysates followed by immunoblotting. Proteins were detected with HRP-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-GST antibody (1:4000; Amersham Biosciences) and HRP-conjugated rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody clone 3F10 (1:4000; Roche Applied Science).For affinity precipitations in the presence of calpain inhibitors, cell culture medium was supplemented with Me2SO (control), calpeptin (75 μg/ml in Me2SO), or calpain inhibitor IV (100 μg/ml in Me2SO). Cells were cotransfected with pDEST27-calpain 4 (5 μg of DNA) and various pMT2SM-HA-αPIX constructs (5 μg of DNA) and incubated overnight in supplemented medium. Then cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing Me2SO (control), calpeptin (75 μg/ml in Me2SO), or calpain inhibitor IV (100 μg/ml in Me2SO).Cell SpreadingCoating of Coverslips—Sterile coverslips were acid-washed, treated with 2% 3-aminopropyltriethoxy-silane (Sigma), and overlaid with 0.25% glutaraldehyde. Subsequently, coverslips were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) in PBS, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and finally washed with PBS before cell plating. This coating procedure prevented unspecific cell spreading on the coverslips and enabled the investigation of fibronectin-induced (and therefore integrin-mediated) cell spreading.Cell Plating—Serum-starved CHO-K1 cells were washed with PBS and detached with 0.5% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). Trypsin reaction was stopped using 0.25 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. To eliminate growth factors, cells were washed once with PBS, once with Puck's saline, and twice with 1% bovine serum albumin in nutrient mixture F-12 (HAM). Finally, cells were resuspended in 0.2% bovine serum albumin in nutrient mixture F-12 (HAM), and 2–3 × 104 cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips. To ensure that cell spreading was indeed fibronectin-induced, we seeded serum-starved CHO-K1 cells onto coverslips coated with fibronectin versus coverslips without fibronectin. Quantification of cell spreading showed that in the case of fibronectin-coated coverslips, 83% of cells could spread, whereas only 22% of cells plated in the absence of fibronectin were able to spread (data not shown). For ectopic expression of various HA-tagged αPIX proteins, CHO-K1 cells were seeded at 1.2 × 106 cells/100-mm cell culture dish in complete culture medium. After 15 h, serum was reduced to 0.5%, and 24 h later, cells were transfected with pMT2SM-HA-αPIX wild type, pMT2SM-HA-αPIX (L386R/L387S), or pMT2SM-HA-αPIX ΔDH (6 μg of DNA each) in the absence of serum according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and prepared for cell spreading experiments on the next day.Inhibition of Cell Spreading Using Calpain Inhibitors—Before plating onto fibronectin-coated coverslips, detached cells were incubated in nutrient mixture F-12 (HAM) supplemented with calpain inhibitor for 30 min. The following inhibitors were tested: the reversible, cell membrane-permeable inhibitor calpeptin (75 μg/ml; Calbiochem), which reacts with the active site of both μ-calpain and m-calpain; the irreversible, cell membrane-permeable calpain inhibitor IV (100 μg/ml; Calbiochem), which nucleophilically attacks the active site of m-calpain; and the reversible, cell membrane-permeable inhibitor PD 151746 (100 μg/ml; Calbiochem), which binds predominantly to the Ca2+-binding site of μ-calpain.ImmunofluorescenceTransfected and untransfected cells, respectively, were plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, rinsed with PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing PBS for 10 min. After residual formaldehyde had been quenched with PBS for 10 min, cells were incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin, 3% goat serum, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 60 min to permeabilize the membrane and block nonspecific antibody binding. For detection of cells expressing HA-tagged αPIX proteins, cells were incubated either with rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-HA (2.5 μg/ml; Sigma) or with mouse monoclonal antibody HA.11 (1.0 μg/ml; Eurogentec) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (4 μg/ml; Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (4 μg/ml; Invitrogen), or Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (4 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Calpain 4 was detected by mouse anti-calpain small subunit monoclonal antibody (1:100; Chemicon), calpain 1 was detected by mouse anti-calpain I large subunit monoclonal antibody (1:100; Chemicon), and calpain 2 was detected by rabbit anticalpain II large subunit polyclonal antibody (10 μg/ml; Chemicon). For ILK detection, cells were stained with mouse anti-ILK vinculin monoclonal antibody (clone 65.1.9; 10 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology), and for the detection of β1 integrin, we used mouse anti-integrin β1 monoclonal antibody (clone DE9; 10 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology). Paxillin was detected using mouse anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences), and for vinculin staining, cells were incubated with mouse anti-human vinculin hVIN-1 monoclonal antibody (1:200; Sigma). As secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (4 μg/ml; Invitrogen) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (4 μg/ml; Invitrogen) was used. After washing twice with high salt PBS (650 mm NaCl) and three times with PBS, cells on coverslips were mounted in glycerol gelatin (Sigma) on microscopic slides. Cells were examined using a Leica DMRA immunofluorescence microscope, and images were acquired on a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope equipped with an Apo 40-by-1.0 oil immersion objective lens.RESULTSIdentification of Calpain 4, the Regulatory Subunit of Calpain, as a Novel αPIX Binding Partner—To identify novel protein interaction partners, the coding region of αPIX was used in a CytoTrap screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library. Of a total of 54 clones that restored growth of cdc25H cells in a galactose-dependent manner, only those clones that also showed αPIX-dependent growth were defined true positives (Fig. 1A). Two independent clones encode the C-terminal region of calpain 4, the small regulatory subunit of the protease calpain, and contain ∼400 bp of the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1B). Calpain 4 consists of two domains, the N-terminal glycin-rich domain V, which is often referred to as a hydrophobic domain, and C-terminal domain VI, which contains five EF-hand Ca2+-binding sequences (24Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). The two cDNAs obtained encode only four EF-hand calcium-binding motifs (Fig. 1B).To verify the interaction between αPIX and calpain 4 in mammalian cells, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in CHO-K1 cells. αPIX was detected by polyclonal anti-PIX antibodies (17Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) that recognize, in addition to αPIX, two isoforms of βPIX (β1PIX and β2PIX) (40Koh C.G. Manser E. Zhao Z.S. Ng C.P. Lim L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4239-4251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a close αPIX homologue. Endogenous αPIX was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-calpain 4 (Fig. 1C, top panel, lane 2), but not with empty FLAG-vector control (Fig. 1C, top panel, lane 1). In addition, an in vivo GST pull-down assay was performed using CHO-K1 cells cotransfected with both GST-calpain 4 and wild-type HA-tagged αPIX. As shown in Fig. 2 (middle panel, lanes 1 and 2), GST-calpain 4 fusion protein bound full-length HA-αPIX, whereas GST alone failed to bind αPIX. Together, these data suggest that calpain 4 is a binding partner of αPIX in vivo.Fig. 2The αPIX SH3-DH-PH triple domain binds calpain 4. The domain structure of various αPIX proteins is shown. CHO-K1 cells were cotransfected with the indicated HA-tagged αPIX constructs and GST-calpain 4. As a control, empty GST-vector was used. The GST-tagged protein complexes were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GST pull-down) and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibody. GST-calpain 4 was able to bring down all HA-tagged αPIX proteins containing the triple domain SH3-DH-PH (middle panel, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). In contrast, no HA-αPIX was precipitated from cells transfected with αPIX constructs lacking at least one of these domains (middle panel, lanes 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20). None of the expressed αPIX proteins was coprecipitated with GST alone (middle panel, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19). Expression of HA-tagged αPIX proteins in total lysates was confirmed by immunoblot (top panel, lanes 1–20). In precipitates, expression of GST-calpain 4"

It has been presumed that Nef proteins accelerate endocytosis of CD4 by linking the receptor to the AP-2 clathrin adaptor. However, the related AP-1 and AP-3 adaptors have also been shown to interact with Nef, hinting at role(s) for these complexes in the intracellular retention of CD4. By using genetic inhibitors of endocytosis and small interfering RNA-induced knockdown of AP-2, we show that accelerated CD4 endocytosis is not a dominant mechanism of HIV-1 (NL4-3 strain) Nef in epithelial cells, T lymphocyte cell lines, or peripheral blood lymphocytes. Furthermore, we show that both the CD4 recycling from the plasma membrane and the nascent CD4 in transit to the plasma membrane are susceptible to intracellular retention in HIV-1 Nef-expressing cells. In contrast, AP-2-mediated enhanced endocytosis constitutes the predominant mechanism for SIV (MAC-239 strain) Nef-induced down-regulation of human CD4 in human cells.

The cytoplasmic domains of plasma membrane receptors contain sequence determinants that regulate orderly protein sorting during anterograde transport, specify organelle targeting, and determine the intracellular fate of internalized receptors after agonist binding or cell activation (1Bonifacino J.S.

Nef reduces the steady-state levels of CD4 apparently by accelerating receptor endocytosis and misdirecting the internalized CD4 to lysosomes for breakdown. A membrane-proximal dileucine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 is both necessary and sufficient for the HIV-1 Nef-mediated down-regulation (12Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R. Lenburg M.E. Trono D. Cell. 1994; 76: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 13Pitcher C. Honing S. Fingerhut A. Bowers K. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Specific interactions of Nef with the components of heterotetrameric adaptor complexes are critical determinants of this process. Mutations at the 2 leucines in the highly conserved (D/E)XXXL(L/I) dileucine motif in the solvent-exposed, C-terminal flexible loop of both HIV and SIV Nef proteins abolish AP-1 and AP-3 adaptor binding and CD4 down-regulation (10Craig H.M.

Furthermore, CD4-Nef or CD8-Nef chimeras fusing the ecto- and transmembrane domains of CD4 or CD8 to Nef undergo rapid endocytosis in a dileucine motif-dependent manner (11Bresnahan P.A. Yonemoto W.

Trono D. Immunity. 1997; 6: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). SIV Nef has an additional tyrosine-based sorting signal of the type YXXØ, which presumably binds to the AP-2 complex and is implicated in enhancing endocytosis of CD4 (17Bresnahan P.A. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2977-2981PubMed Google Scholar, 18Piguet V. Chen Y.L. Mangasarian A. Foti M. Carpentier J.L. Trono D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2472-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). From these findings, Nef is presumed to serve as a “connector” between CD4 and the endocytic machinery (6Oldridge J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 302-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Mangasarian A. Foti M. Aiken C. Chin D. Carpentier J.L. Trono D. Immunity. 1997; 6: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Such a role would necessitate a physical interaction between Nef and CD4. CD4-Nef complexes have been demonstrated in insect cells overexpressing both proteins (19Harris M.P. Neil J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in a yeast two-hybrid system (20Rossi F. Gallina A. Milanesi G. Virology. 1996; 217: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and in in vitro binding assays with Nef protein and peptides corresponding to the CD4 cytoplasmic domain (21Grzesiek S. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10256-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Preusser A. Briese L. Baur A.S. Willbold D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3960-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The objectives of this study were to inquire whether endocytic enhancement is the sole mechanism of Nef-induced CD4 down-modulation and to elucidate the differences, if any, in the mechanisms of HIV-1 and SIV Nef with respect to recruitment of different adaptor complexes and subunits in the process. Using a yeast three-hybrid assay, we demonstrated recently that (D/E)XXXL(L/I)-type signals from HIV and SIV Nefs interacted in a bipartite manner with the adaptor hemicomplexes, γ·σ1 of AP-1 and δ·σ3 of AP-3. The analogous α·σ2 of AP-2 and ϵ·σ4 subunits of AP-4 did not interact with Nef. Interaction of HIV-1 Nef protein with the individual subunits of AP complexes was much weaker or non-existent (15Janvier K. Kato Y. Boehm M. Rose J.R. Martina J.A. Kim B.Y. Venkatesan S. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).We have extended the above studies to show that the loss of CD4 at the cell surface of HIV-1 Nef-expressing cells did not result exclusively from accelerated endocytosis of CD4. Both the recycling CD4 and the nascent receptor in transit to the plasma membrane were susceptible to intracellular retention and degradation in HIV-1 Nef-expressing cells. In contrast, SIV Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation resulted mostly from enhanced endocytosis and was dramatically reversed by genetic inhibitors of endocytosis or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-driven knockdown of AP-2 complexes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Viruses—Human T cell lines used in this study included CD4-positive Jurkat cells or the A3.01 derivative of CEM cells and CD4-negative A2.01 cells. These T cell lines and a HeLa CD4 cell line, clone 6C (HT-6C), were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Rockville, MD and propagated. The T lymphocytes were propagated in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and the HeLa CD4 cell line in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FCS. The HeLa CD4 cells were monitored periodically for the inevitable outgrowth of CD4(–) cells, at which time they were selected on G418 (500 μg/ml) for two passages. Human T cell lines expressing wild type CD4 (line A2D8), or the tCD4 mutant (line T402), truncated at the 402nd residue and thus lacking the C-terminal domain, were constructed by retroviral transduction of the CD4-negative T cell line A2.01 using a retroviral vector and neomycin selection (23Gratton S. Yao X.J. Venkatesan S. Cohen E.A. Sekaly R.P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3305-3311PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and periodically selected by G418 (500 μg/ml) as above. PBLs were isolated from whole blood, buffy coat, or lymphocyterich leukopaks provided by the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. Red blood cells were disrupted with ammonium chloride in potassium bicarbonate lysis solution and removed by gentle centrifugation. The final pellet of d0 peripheral blood mononuclear cells was suspended in RPMI with 10% FCS. For T-cell activation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells purified by banding after Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation were stimulated by CD3 mAb for 36 h in the presence of interleukin-2 (20 IU/ml) in RPMI with 10% FCS, following which they were propagated in medium containing interleukin-2 (24Venkatesan S.

For expression studies, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 or 10 plaque-forming units/cell unless indicated otherwise.Recombinant DNA Constructs—The original Nef expression plasmid, pCMV-Nef, has been described (32Maitra R.K. Ahmad N. Holland S.M. Venkatesan S. Virology. 1991; 182: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For expression in mammalian cells, wild type or mutant Nef cDNAs were PCR-amplified from the respective HIV and SIV proviruses or other recombinant plasmids and cloned into EcoRI-SalI sites of pCI-neo vector (Promega, Madison, WI). CMV promoter-linked CD4 and CD8 plasmids were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Rockville MD. CD4 was mutated by a two-step PCR mutagenesis protocol (33Venkatesan S. Gerstberger S.M. Park H. Holland S.M. Nam Y. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7469-7480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to exchange the codons for 2 leucines at 438 – 439 to alanines and cloned into the pCI-neo vector to generate LL/AA CD4. Dominant-negative Eps15 deletion mutant fused N-terminally to GFP (GFP-Eps15Δ95/295) was obtained from Alexandre Benmerah at INSERM, Paris, France (34Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-tagged WT dynamin and the K44A dominant-negative dynamin mutant (35Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) were from Julie Donaldson at NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. EYFP-tagged Rab5 and Rab5-S34N have been described (24Venkatesan S. Rose J.J. Lodge R. Murphy P.M. Foley J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3305-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Antibodies—The following mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained: 1) against α, γ, δ, and ϵ-adaptins, unconjugated or dye-conjugated CD71 (transferrin receptor, TfnR), and unconjugated CD46 (BD Transduction and Pharmingen Laboratories) and 2) unconjugated, Alexa Fluor 488-, PE-, or APC-conjugated CD4 and CD8 mAbs (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The following polyclonal antibodies were also used: 1) against the σ3 subunit of AP-3 adaptor (36Dell'Angelica E.C. Ooi C.E. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15078-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and 2) against TfnR (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal antibody (TW 2.3) against the vaccinia virus E3L gene product (37Yuwen H. Cox J.H. Yewdell J. Bennick J.R. Moss B. Virology. 1993; 195: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was a gift from Jonathan Yewdell, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Rabbit antiserum against HIV-1 gp160 protein was a gift of Ronald Willey, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Secondary antibodies to mouse, rabbit, goat, and sheep IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, 568, or 647 dyes were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR).Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells, cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (v/v), were transfected using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBLs were isolated from whole blood, buffy coat, or lymphocyte-rich leukopaks provided by the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, as described (24Venkatesan S. Rose J.J. Lodge R. Murphy P.M. Foley J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3305-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CD4+ T cells were enriched by negative selection using magnetic bead technology (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). PBLs and T cell lines were transfected using an Amaxa Biosystems electroporator with the recommended reagents (AMAXA Inc., Gaithersburg, MD).Flow Cytometry—General protocols of flow cytometry using HeLa cell transfectants, primary T cells, and lines have been described before (24Venkatesan S. Rose J.J. Lodge R. Murphy P.M. Foley J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3305-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In all transfections, plasmids encoding EGFP or CD8 were included to normalize for transfection efficiency. For detection of internal antigens, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin treatment and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prior to antibody staining in the presence of 0.1% saponin. Vaccinia virus infection was monitored by FACS analysis of cells permeabilized by saponin, using a monoclonal antibody (TW 2.3) against the vaccinia virus E3L gene product (37Yuwen H. Cox J.H. Yewdell J. Bennick J.R. Moss B. Virology. 1993; 195: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). At 4 h after vaccinia virus infection, 40 – 60% of cells scored positively with this antibody.CD4 Endocytosis and Recycling—CD4 endocytic kinetics was determined by flow cytometry assay essentially as described previously (38Greenberg M.E. Bronson S. Lock M. Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6964-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Pelchen-Matthews A. Armes J.E. Marsh M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were co-transfected with WT or mutated CD4 along with WT Nef or the NefXho (NX) Nef deletion mutant. Alternatively, Jurkat cells were transfected with Nef or NX plasmid. In all transfections, CD8 plasmid was included to enable gating of transfected cells. At 30 h after transfection, cells were reacted with PE-conjugated Leu3A mAb for 30 min on ice in DMEM or RPMI 1640 (for Jurkat cells) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. An aliquot of cells was co-stained at 0 – 4 °C with CD8 APC to determine the transfection efficiency and CD4 PE to quantify the CD4 receptor density at the cell surface. The bulk of the cells that had been stained with CD4 PE only were rinsed thrice with RPMI containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 2– 4 °C to remove the excess unbound antibody and incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times, dual 50-μl aliquots were diluted with 5–10 volumes of RPMI at neutral or acid pH (pH 2 for HeLa cells, pH 3 for Jurkat cells) and incubated for 45 s at 2– 4 °C. After rinsing with neutral pH RPMI, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 2– 4 °C, rinsed with PBS, and counterstained with CD8-APC and processed for flow cytometry. Mean fluorescence values (MFVs) for CD4 were calculated for cells gated for CD8 expression. To calculate the fraction of CD4 internalization at each time point, [F(int)ti], the CD4 MFV at zero time acid wash [MFV(pH 2)t0] was subtracted from the MFVs for each time point [MFV(pH 2)ti] times, and the resulting value for each time point was divided by the total MFV (neutral pH wash) [MFV(pH 7.4)ti] as indicated by the equation below.F(int)ti=[MFV(pH 2)ti−MFV(pH2)t0]MFV(pH 7.4)ti×100(Eq. 1) For microscopic visualization of CD4 endocytosis, fluorescent antibody was fed to living cells together with fluorescent transferrin as a monitor for clathrin-dependent endocytosis of TfnR. HeLa cells transiently expressing CD4, WT Nef, or Nef-Xho mutant and GFP- or YFP-tagged dominant-negative inhibitors of endocytosis were used. Cells on coverslips at 50% confluence were starved for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM without serum. They were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 200 μl of DMEM (with 0.5% bovine serum albumin) with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated Tfn (50 μg/ml) and APC-labeled CD4 mAb (10 μl of mAbs or 1–2 μg of equivalent). Cells were rinsed thrice with PBS, fixed with paraformaldehyde, rinsed and mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). In some experiments (indicated in the relevant figure legends), cell surface bound antibody was stripped by treatment for 1–2 min with 0.5% acetic acid in 500 mm NaCl after the first rinse before fixation.CD4 recycling was calculated as described (39Pelchen-Matthews A. Armes J.E. Marsh M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. HeLa cell transfectants were labeled with PE-conjugated CD4 mAb as for endocytosis studies, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to maximize antibody internalization, rinsed, and suspended in 5 volumes of RPMI at pH 2 at 4 °C for 2 min. Cells were then transferred to neutral buffer, and a time 0 aliquot was collected, fixed, and counterstained with CD8-APC and analyzed by FACS. The remaining cells were warmed to 37 °C for the indicated times, placed in timed aliquots, washed in cold acid, fixed, and counterstained for CD8. CD4 MFVs in the CD8 gated population was determined by FACS analysis. The percentage of recycled CD4 was determined by dividing the MFVs during the rewarming period by the acid-resistant MFV before rewarming.Yeast Culture, Transformation, and Two- and Three-hybrid Assays— Two-hybrid genetic analysis between various Nefs and the adaptor subunits was carried out as described before (15Janvier K. Kato Y. Boehm M. Rose J.R. Martina J.A. Kim B.Y. Venkatesan S. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c (Clontech) was maintained on dropout agar plates lacking methionine. Transformation was performed by the lithium acetate procedure as described in the instructions for the MATCH-MAKER two-hybrid kit (Clontech). HF7c transformants were selected by spreading on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and methionine. For colony growth essays, HF7c transformants were dotted on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, methionine, and histidine complemented with 3 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma) and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 3–5 days.Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—For metabolic labeling experiments, transfected or virus-infected HeLa cells or T cells (106–107) were rinsed thrice with PBS and incubated in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM containing 1% dialyzed FCS (0.2 ml/sample) for 10 min. For steady-state labeling, cells were incubated for 1 h by the addition of 35S-labeled Trans-label (ICN Corp) to 1 mCi/ml. For measuring the kinetics of protein biosynthesis, 2 × 107 cells were labeled for 15 min in 500 μl of labeling medium (1 mCi/ml). At the end of the labeling, the cells were diluted with 10 volumes of complete RPMI medium. Aliquots were removed immediately after labeling and at the indicated periods during the chase (from 0 to 12 h). The cells were rinsed twice in PBS and processed for SDS-PAGE analysis. The cells were disrupted by three cycles of freeze-thawing (thawing to 37 °C for 1–2 min to disrupt rafts) in 500 μl of extraction buffer containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40 (or CHAPS), 0.25% Triton X-100, and one tablet of protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science) followed by extraction at 4 °C for 1 h. The extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. The supernatants were precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of immobilized protein G agarose beads (Pierce) coated with preimmune rabbit or mouse sera. Labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4 °C with protein G agarose beads prebound to the corresponding anti-rabbit polyclonal or anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies. Following specific antibody binding, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 10 –20 volumes of extraction buffer lacking protease inhibitors, and the labeled proteins were eluted by boiling in 50 μl of a buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, glycerol (10% v/v), and bromphenol blue (0.1% w/v). The radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging and quantified.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Twenty-four hours after transfection, HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were stained for immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. After permeabilization, the cells were blocked for 30 min with 1% normal goat serum in PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the primary antibody, washed with PBS, and then incubated for 30 min with the secondary antibody. The different combinations of 1° and 2° antibodies and GFP or GFP fusion proteins are indicated in the respective figure legends. The coverslips were washed and mounted on slides. Images were collected on a Leica TCS-NT/SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA) using a ×63 or ×100 oil immersion objective NA 1.32 and digital zoom up to ×5. Fluorochromes were excited using an argon laser at 488 nm for Alexa Fluor 488 or fluorescein isothiocyanate, a krypton laser at 568 nm for Alexa Fluor 568 or Texas Red, and a helium/neon laser at 633 nm for APC. Fluorescent emission from Alexa Fluor 350 dye was visualized by excitation with a UV laser. Detector slits were configured to minimize any cross-talk between the channels, or the channels were collected separately and later superimposed. Differential interference contrast images were collected simultaneously with the fluorescence images using the transmitted light detector. Eight or more fields were examined per coverslip, and each experimental condition was repeated as indicated in the respective figure legends.RNA-mediated Interference—RNA-mediated interference of μ2 adaptor subunit or vps35 was performed using an siRNA duplex with the following sequence: μ2, 5′AAGUGGAUGCCUUUCGGGUCA-3′ starting at the 30th codon (86th nucleotide in the open reading frame); μ3, 5′AAGGAGAACAGUUCUUGCGGC-3′; and vps35, 5′AAGGUCCAGU-CAUUCCAAAUG-3′ starting at the 24th codon (70th nucleotide in the open reading frame). HeLa cells were transfected twice at 72-h intervals with 200 nm of the siRNAs, using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). After 144 h of siRNA treatment, the cells were transfected as described above for expression of Nef, CD4, and CD8. Human T cell lines and PBLs were electroporated once with 100 nm siRNA using the Amaxa system. The cells were rested for 24 –36 h before electroporating with an additional 100 nm siRNA and expression plasmids as indicated in the relevant figure legends.RESULTSHIV-1 Nef Delayed the Cell Surface Expression and Reduced the Cell Surface Density of de novo Synthesized CD4 —Initially, we examined the kinetics of transport to the plasma membrane of de novo synthesized CD4 in the context of Nef expression. A2.01 (CD4-negative) T lymphocytes were co-infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding WT CD4 (vCB-7) and NL4-3 HIV-1 Nef allele (vvNef) or a control virus (vSC8). Following 30 min of virus adsorption, cells were sampled at periodic intervals and examined by flow cytometry. Both sets of infected cells displayed similar levels of endogenous CD7 expression (not shown) that was used to monitor pot"
https://openalex.org/W2008486046,"A structural analysis of the surface areas of cytochrome c6, responsible for the transient interaction with photosystem I, was performed by NMR transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy. The hemeprotein was titrated by adding increasing amounts of the chlorophyllic photosystem, and the NMR spectra of the free and bound protein were analyzed in a comparative way. The NMR signals of cytochrome c6 residues located at the hydrophobic and electrostatic patches, which both surround the heme cleft, were specifically modified by binding. The backbones of internal residues close to the hydrophobic patch of cytochrome c6 were also affected, a fact that is ascribed to the conformational changes taking place inside the hemeprotein when interacting with photosystem I. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy of a transient complex between soluble and membrane proteins. A structural analysis of the surface areas of cytochrome c6, responsible for the transient interaction with photosystem I, was performed by NMR transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy of a transient complex between soluble and membrane proteins. NMR spectroscopy makes it possible to observe the signals of particular atoms in the free and bound states of any molecule (1Diercks T. Coles M. Kessler H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 5: 285-291Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and has thus become an essential tool for the analysis of protein-protein interactions (2Zuiderwerg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Depending on both the time scale of the relaxation process and the exchange kinetics, the NMR signals of the free protein can provide relevant information on its bound state. Conventional solution NMR spectroscopy is usually limited to complexes with a molecular mass lower than 50 kDa because of their quick tumbling, and it relies on the average of orientation-dependent dipolar interactions and chemical shifts. Slow tumbling makes the structural analysis of membrane-attached proteins difficult because of the large size of lipid bilayers. It is possible to study the membrane complexes in uniaxially oriented samples, although another alternative is to use solid state NMR, in which transverse relaxation is minimized by eliminating its two components, the chemical shift anisotropy and the dipolar coupling between paramagnetic nuclei (3Thompson L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Most of the current experimental data in the literature concern the interaction between a small soluble molecule (e.g. drug) and the extracellular domains of a membrane protein (4Watts A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The structure of small signaling peptides when bound to their specific membrane receptors has also been analyzed, and the conformation of the receptor-bound form of a 27-residue peptide has been determined by transferred nuclear Overhauser effect upon digitonin solubilization of the membrane receptor (5Inooka H. Ohtaki T. Kitahara O. Ikegami T. Endo S. Kitada C. Ogi K. Onda H. Fujino M. Shirakawa M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These techniques, which have not been employed yet with large protein complexes, are probably not useful for the study of transient protein-protein interactions. Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY), 1The abbreviations used are: TROSY, transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy; PSI, photosystem I. which is based on the mutual cancellation between chemical shift anisotropy and dipolar coupling contributions at high fields (6Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wu ̈thrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 11: 12366-12371Crossref Scopus (2086) Google Scholar), has already been used to analyze slowly tumbling molecules (7Tugarinov V. Muhandiram R. Ayed A. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 1: 10025-10035Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It has also been used in the structural analysis of protein-protein interactions within large systems, namely the 900-kDa GroEL-GroES complex (8Flaux J. Bertelsen E.B. Horwich A.L. Wu ̈thrich K. Nature. 2002; 418: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and the tumor suppressor p53 upon binding to Hsp90 (9Ru ̈diger S. Freund S.M.V. Vepritsev D.B. Fersht A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11085-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have thus employed such detection techniques, along with adequate isotopic labeling, to study the interaction areas within the physiological transient complex formed by a large membrane complex and a small soluble protein. In particular, we look at the 1-MDa membrane-embedded photosystem I (PSI) reaction center and its 10-kDa electron donor protein cytochrome c6. This is an excellent model system to validate our novel experimental approach, as there is a large amount of structural and functional data in the literature for both the chlorophyllic complex and the metalloprotein from a wide variety of organisms (10Fromme P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Golbeck J.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 237-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria, the functional interaction between PSI and cytochrome c6 has been investigated extensively by using time-resolved optical spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis (see Ref. 12Di ́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Herva ́s M. Molina-Heredia F.P. De la Cerda B. De la Rosa M.A. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 75: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar for a review). In cytochrome c6, two functional areas have been identified: a hydrophobic patch for electron transfer (site 1) and an electrically charged area for complex formation (site 2). In PSI, the H loop of its PsaB subunit seems to be involved in electrostatic interactions with the electron donor (13Navarro J.A. Herva ́s M. Sun J. De la Cerda B. Chitnis P.R. De la Rosa M.A. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 65: 63-68Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Sun J. Wu X. Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19048-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas a tryptophan dimer at the i/j loops of PsaA/B could be responsible for the hydrophobic interactions at the recognition site. In this work, we investigated the residues of cytochrome c6 involved in the interaction with PSI by using TROSY NMR spectroscopy. To our knowledge, this is the first NMR analysis of the residues of a soluble protein involved in the interaction with a large membrane complex. Protein Preparation—Uniformly 15N-labeled cytochrome c6 from the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7119 was produced in Escherichia coli JM109 cells transformed with the pEAC-WT (15Molina-Heredia F.P. Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and pEC86 (16Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Ku ̈nzaler P. Tho ̈ny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) plasmids. Culture conditions and protein purification methods were as described previously (17Crowley P.B. Di ́az-Quintana A. Molina-Heredia F.P. Nieto P. Sutter M. Haehnel W. De la Rosa M.A. Ubbink M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48685-48689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Trimeric PSI particles were obtained as described by Hervás et al. (18Herva ́s M. Ortega J.M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Bottin H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 235-241Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and PSI monomers were purified by following the same method but replacing calcium salt with 200 mm MgCl2 (19Ford R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 115-125Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The thylakoidal membranes were treated with 0.2% (w/v) β-dodecylmaltoside for 10 min in the dark. A sucrose gradient ranging from 16 to 22% (w/v) was used to separate PSI from PSII and phycobiliproteins. The P700 content of PSI samples was calculated by following the photoinduced absorbance change at 820 nm and using an absorption coefficient of 6.5 mm–1 cm–1 (20Mathis P. Se ́tif P. Isr. J. Chem. 1981; 21: 316-320Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentration was determined according to Arnon (21Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PSI preparations were tested by time-resolved optical spectroscopy as described previously (18Herva ́s M. Ortega J.M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Bottin H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 235-241Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. Di ́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The kinetics of P700+ reduction by either plastocyanin or cytochrome c6 were similar with both PSI trimers and monomers. The data from SDS-PAGE indicated that no PSI subunits were lost during the treatment to get the photosynthetic monomers. An electrophoretic analysis of PSI samples under semi-denatured conditions was routinely performed to check their trimeric or monomeric nature and homogeneity. NMR Samples—Samples containing either 1.6 mm15N-labeled cytochrome c6 or 1.3 mm unlabeled cytochrome c6 were prepared in 0.3 ml of 95:5 (v/v) H2O/D2O solutions containing 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6, and 2 mm sodium ascorbate. The cytochrome c6 samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, YM3 membrane), and their protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an absorption coefficient of 26.2 mm–1 cm–1 at 553 nm for the ferrous form of cytochrome c6 (23Medina M. Di ́az A. Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. Go ́mez-Moreno C. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PSI monomers were concentrated using a Vivaspin 2 ml concentrator with a 100-kDa molecular mass cutoff. The buffer used was 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6, in 95:5 (v/v) H2O/D2O supplemented with 0.025% (w/v) β-dodecylmaltoside. Two different samples were prepared; one had a PSI concentration of 1.80 mm and a chlorophyll/P700 ratio of ∼80, and the other had a PSI concentration of 1.08 mm and a chlorophyll/P700 ratio of ∼110. To investigate complex formations between cytochrome c6 and PSI monomers by NMR, a 0.23-mm15N-labeled cytochrome c6 sample was titrated by adding microliter aliquots of a 1.80 or 1.08 mm PSI stock solution. The pH value was adjusted before and after each addition. A sample of free cytochrome c6 in the same buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6, in 5% (v/v) D2O solution supplemented with 2 mm sodium ascorbate and 0.025% β-dodecylmaltoside) was used as a reference. Titrations with PSI trimers were performed in a similar way but using a stock solution of 0.2 mm trimeric PSI. The effect of ionic strength was investigated at pH 6 upon the addition of sodium chloride at varying concentrations. The two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY spectra (see below) for cytochrome c6-PSI samples were recorded at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mm salt concentration. In all experiments, control measurements were recorded for free cytochrome c6 under the same conditions. NMR Spectroscopy—The spectral analysis of the cytochrome c6-PSI complex was performed on a Varian INOVA 800 NMR spectrometer at 298 K. The two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY spectra were recorded using spectral widths of 12 ppm (1H) and 30 ppm (15N) as a matrix of 2048 × 512 complex points. Varian software (VNMR) was employed for spectral processing using zero filling with np(1H) = 4096, ni1(15N) = 1024, and a sine-square window function. A polynomial base-line correction was made automatically. The analysis of line-broadening perturbations of the PSI-bound hemeprotein with respect to free cytochrome c6 was performed in SPARKY 3. 2T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco. The sequential assignment of cytochrome c6 has been reported previously (17Crowley P.B. Di ́az-Quintana A. Molina-Heredia F.P. Nieto P. Sutter M. Haehnel W. De la Rosa M.A. Ubbink M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48685-48689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To estimate line widths, the peaks were fitted to a Lorentzian function for the 15N and 1H dimensions. Base-line correction was not performed, and data above the lowest contour level were used to obtain the line widths. Close peaks (less than 100 Hz in 15N and 10 Hz in 1H) were grouped together. A minimization with 10,000 steps and a tolerance of 0.01% was done to fit every signal of the protein backbone. Four different threshold levels were used for each spectrum to minimize the possible error in line width calculations. Each value was compared with the data inferred from the other three contour levels, and it was rejected when the difference was higher than 4-fold the standard deviation. When the three values were identical and, consequently, the standard deviation was zero, the line width of the analyzed peak was only rejected when the difference with respect to the other three measurements was larger than 5 Hz. Thus, the line width of a signal corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the reliable data according to such criteria. NMR Line Width Analysis—In the analysis of the line width data (Δν1/2), the overall broadening (ΔΔν1/2) obtained from signals displaying only minor line broadening was first subtracted from the line width of the corresponding signal. Then, for each residue, the differences of line widths between free and interacting cytochrome c6 were calculated for each point of the titration series (ΔΔν1/2 Binding). The threshold value, used to identify a specifically broadened residue when data from the titration series were analyzed together, was defined as the average normalized ΔΔν1/2 Binding for the system plus 2 standard deviations (2Sn–1). The average ΔΔν1/2 Binding and the standard deviation were calculated for all amides with normalized values ≤20 Hz on the basis that normalized data >20 Hz clearly indicate a specifically broadened residue and that their inclusion would bias the average to a higher value. Nostoc Cytochrome c6 Homology Model—A homology structural model for cytochrome c6 was built using the COMPOSER module of SYBYL 6.5 (Tripos Inc.) along with the crystal structures for the hemeprotein from Monoraphidium (PDB code 1CTJ) (24Fraza ̃o C.

Titration of 15N-Labeled Cytochrome c6 with PSI Monomers—The interaction between cytochrome c6 and PSI was inferred from the NMR spectra of a 15N-labeled cytochrome c6 sample recorded upon the addition of increasing amounts of PSI. Only very small chemical shift changes were observed for the cytochrome c6 signals upon titration. Therefore, the peak assignment in the presence of PSI was obtained by a comparison with the spectrum of free cytochrome c6. However, the two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY spectra of cytochrome c6 before and after the addition of PSI revealed distinct changes in the line width of the signals that can be ascribed to its interaction with PSI. Several signals experienced a broadening significantly larger than the average (Fig. 1A), others showed a broadening below the threshold (Fig. 1B), and a few signals were in coalescence (Fig. 1C). In addition, a set of minor signals appeared immediately adjacent to the existing peaks (Fig. 1D). The histograms in Fig. 2 show the statistical distribution of absolute line width changes (Δν1/2) upon increasing the [PSI]/[cytochrome c6] ratio. The general line broadening of cytochrome c6 signals in the 15N and 1H dimensions can be ascribed to the increase in effective molecular mass and concomitant increase in the rotational correlation time of cytochrome c6 when interacting with PSI. In fact, the effective molecular mass of the complex between cytochrome c6 and monomeric PSI is ∼350 kDa, as compared with the 10-kDa mass of free cytochrome c6. Such a signal broadening becomes significant at a [PSI](μm)/[cytochrome c6](μm) ratio of 38/208. It is noteworthy that the indirect (15N) dimension seems to be more sensitive to changes in line widths than the direct (1H) dimension; for the second point of the titration (Fig. 2C), the line width distribution is wider, and its maximum shifts to higher values. In addition to the general line broadening, several amino acidic residues undergo additional changes in 15N and 1H line widths. After normalizing the data (see”Experimental Procedures“) and calculating the differences in signal line widths (ΔΔν1/2 Binding) for each titration point (bound cytochrome c6) and reference (free cytochrome c6), the backbone amide NMR signals of 26 amino acids of cytochrome c6 show significant changes (ΔΔν1/2 Binding ≥ 〈ΔΔν1/2 Binding〉+ 2Sn–1) in 15N and/or 1H line widths. As shown in Fig. 3, these residues are found in four stretches in the amino acid sequence of cytochrome c6. The first stretch comprises the residues between positions 9 and 19 (except His-18), and the second stretch comprises the residues between positions 23 and 29. These residues, which belong to site 1 of cytochrome c6 (12Di ́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Herva ́s M. Molina-Heredia F.P. De la Cerda B. De la Rosa M.A. Photosynth.

Some of the signals (e.g. Ser-16, Gly-20, and Thr-30) become broadened beyond detection limit throughout the titration process. The third stretch comprises the residues between positions 57 and 66, and the fourth stretch comprises the residues between positions 72 and 79. Proline residues are at positions 59 and 67. Affected residues in these stretches undergo specific ΔΔν1/2 Binding changes, and some of them (e.g. Gly-63) are broadened beyond detection, as are those in the first two stretches. The residues Lys-62, Arg-64, and Lys-66 are at the electrostatic patch (site 2) of cytochrome c6 (12Di ́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Herva ́s M. Molina-Heredia F.P. De la Cerda B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13292-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A minor signal appears immediately adjacent to the signals of residues in the third and fourth stretches (e.g. residues Ala-57, Met-58, Ala-60, Phe-61, Lys-62, Leu-65, Lys-66, Val-73, Ala-74, and Val-77). The peak displacement of the major signals varies between 0 and 0.08 ppm in the 1H dimension and between 0 and 0.8 ppm in the 15N dimension (Table IS in the supplemental materials). We can exclude the possibility that the new peaks that appear upon PSI addition originate from a bad cancellation of multiple components because the differences in frequencies for most of them do not fall within the range of 85–100 Hz, as would be expected. The new peaks could arise from protein denaturation, but this possibility can also be excluded because a control spectrum with a fresh sample at the maximum PSI concentration displayed similar side peaks. A plausible explanation is that the peaks are because of the bound form of cytochrome c6 in slow exchange with the free form. From the observed chemical shift changes, one can then estimate that the rate constant for complex dissociation (koff) is between 1 and 10 s–1. In fact, a k value of 1.5 s– off 1and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 9 μm (23Medina M. Di ́az A. Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. Go ́mez-Moreno C. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) allow an acceptable fit between simulated and experimental line shapes (Fig. 1S in the supplemental materials). Map of Cytochrome c6 Residues at the Interface with PSI— The mapping in Fig. 4 shows the residues at the cytochrome c6 surface (modeled as described under”Experimental Procedures“) that are affected by PSI addition, with each residue being colored according to its line broadening in the 15N dimension. Three of the four sequential stretches of residues (Fig. 3) form two main clusters surrounding the heme cleft at the protein surface, and the fourth stretch is located near the first stretch inside the protein. Thus the structural clustering of stretches with broadened residues in cytochrome c6 suggests that such residues are forming part of two surface areas for interaction with PSI. Apart from the two patches that define the complex interface, the residues Asp-72, Ala-74, Tyr-76, Leu-78, and Gly-79 on the rear of the protein are also affected (Fig. 4). They belong to the fourth stretch, which is formed by backbone amides (Asp-72, Val-73, Ala-74, Tyr-76, Ala-77, Leu-78, and Gly-79) from helix IV (Fig. 5). These residues, except Asp-72, undergo line width perturbations larger than 4 Hz over the threshold in one or two dimensions. As helix IV is adjacent to some residues of helix I (Ile-9, Phe-10, and Ser-11), the observed changes are probably a secondary effect caused by helix I perturbation. Electrostatic Effects—The complex between cytochrome c6 and PSI at a [PSI](μm)/[cytochrome c6](μm) ratio of 38/208 was investigated in solutions containing 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mm NaCl (data not shown). The ΔΔν1/2 Binding values for most residues decreased with increasing salt concentration, a finding that agrees with the kinetic data reported in the literature (12Di ́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Herva ́s M. Molina-Heredia F.P. De la Cerda B. De la Rosa M.A. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 75: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. Di ́az A. Bottin H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33565-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such a decrease in binding affinity reflects the electrostatic nature of the cytochrome c6-PSI complex. The most strongly affected residues (e.g. Glu-37, Lys-62, Lys-66, and Glu-68) undergo a significant signal shift at 40 and 80 mm NaCl. This result is indicative of a strong electrostatic interaction between such charged residues and salt ions. At the highest salt concentration (80 mm), there still remains an ∼5-Hz broadening that can be ascribed to the salt effects on the magnetic field homogeneity. Titration of 15N-Labeled Cytochrome c6 with PSI Trimers— The molecular mass of the in vivo complex between trimeric PSI, which is the physiological form (19Ford R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 115-125Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and cytochrome c6 is >1 MDa. The NMR spectrum of cytochrome c6 after the addition of PSI trimers is thus weaker than that of the free molecule, although most of the signals can still be observed. A number of spectral signals as high as 29 completely disappear upon binding to PSI (Fig. 6), with a set (Phe-10, Ser-11, Ala-12, Ala-15, Ser-16, Cys-17, His-18, Gly-21, Asn-23, Val-25, Gln-26, Ala-27, Lys-29, and Thr-30) mapping at site 1 of cytochrome c6. Many of these residues also show a significant broadening upon binding to monomeric PSI. Other fading peaks correspond to Lys-33, Leu-36, and Met-41, as well as to residues at site 2 (Ala-57, Phe-61, and Lys-62) and helix IV (Leu-78 and Gly-79). The residues Met-58, Lys-66, and Val-73 exhibit a small chemical shift perturbation. PSI trimers and monomers thus induce similar changes on the NMR signals of cytochrome c6 residues. Such a finding indicates that the same regions of cytochrome c6 are involved in the interaction with both trimeric and monomeric PSI. The Cytochrome c6-PSI Interaction—The interaction between cytochrome c6 and PSI is studied herein by using both the monomeric (Fig. 1) and trimeric (Fig. 6) forms of PSI. Upon titration of cytochrome c6 with increasing amounts of PSI, no fast chemical exchange is observed within the spectral time scale, but the corresponding global and specific line broadenings are indicative of changes in the apparent transversal relaxation time. This finding, along with the appearance of distinct side peaks, suggests the occurrence of a slow chemical exchange. In such an exchange regime, the broadening of free cytochrome c6 signals would be because of the contribution of the complex to the transverse relaxation rate, yielding information on the dynamics of cytochrome c6 within the transient complex with PSI. A general line broadening, because of the increase of the global correlation time of the aggregate, is observed for all the signals. Simultaneously, we can detect specific changes that can be ascribed to differences in local internal motions upon interaction with PSI. Some other phenomena could contribute to the line broadening of signals (e.g. Ser-16, Gly-20, Thr-30, and Gly-63) beyond detection limits. Recently, several studies (28Sahu S.C. Bhuyan A.K. Udgaonkar J.B. Hosur R.V. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Stone M.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) show that the interaction sites often suffer a decrease in flexibility because of binding, although the line width could also be influenced by side chain dynamics (30Goodman J.L. Pagel M.D. Stone M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 295: 963-978Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that all the fading signals correspond to amino acids with short side chains. Previous site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies had shown that Nostoc cytochrome c6 possesses two functional sites (one hydrophobic (site 1), the other positively charged (site 2), both flanking the heme cleft) for the redox interaction with PSI (12Di ́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Herva ́s M. Molina-Heredia F.P. De la Cerda B. De la Rosa M.A. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 75: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Molina-Heredia F.P. Di ́az-Quintana A.

Herva ́s M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13292-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such sites perfectly match the two interaction areas herein identified by NMR (Fig. 4). Binding of cytochrome c6 to PSI induces changes not only in surface residues but also in some internal residues, namely those at the crossing region between helices I and IV (Fig. 5). As α-helices behave as rigid bodies because of their stabilizing HNn+4–On H-bonds, we can assume that the structural changes in helix I upon binding to PSI could transmit the conformational perturbation to neighbor residues in helix IV. The Binding Model—As the line broadening of residues at site 2 of cytochrome c6 is smaller than that of amino acids at site 1, we could assume that site 1 is just at the center of the interface area within the transient complex, whereas site 2 is at the interface edge. This would be in agreement with a binding model where the encounter complex is first driven by electrostatic attractions and further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, as suggested for other electron-transfer complexes (31Crowley P.B. Ubbink M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the particular case of Nostoc, it is still under debate whether the cytochrome c6-PSI complex undergoes a”rearrangement step“prior to electron transfer (12Di ́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Herva ́s M. Molina-Heredia F.P. De la Cerda B. De la Rosa M.A. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 75: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. Di ́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Molina-Heredia F.P. Di ́az-Quintana A. Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol.

De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we observed that all NMR signals were under slow exchange, and so a kinetically stable intermediate complex could be proposed. Such a long living complex could explain the biphasic kinetics reported for PSI reduction by cytochrome c6 in flash experiments, thereby making a specific rearrangement step unnecessary (22Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. Di ́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recent γ-ray-perturbed angular correlation studies have shown a low correlation time (τc, ∼130 ns) for plastocyanin bound to plant PSI (33Danielsen E. Scheller H.V. Bauer R. Hemmingsen L. Bjerrum M.J. Hansson O ̈. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11531-11540Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) compared with that expected (440 ns) from the molecular weight of the complex. If this would be extrapolated as such to the cytochrome c6-PSI complex, the amides at the interface edge of the bound hemeprotein would not be totally frozen, and their NMR signals could still remain detectable in the complex (a non-symmetrical two-site exchange simulation is available as supplemental data). We have recently analyzed the interaction of Nostoc cytochrome c6 with soluble cytochrome f from Phormidium laminosum (17Crowley P.B. Di ́az-Quintana A. Molina-Heredia F.P. Nieto P. Sutter M. Haehnel W. De la Rosa M.A. Ubbink M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48685-48689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The calculated KD value for this complex (∼100 μm) is higher than that reported for the interaction of Nostoc cytochrome c6 with PSI (∼9 μm) (23Medina M. Di ́az A. Herva ́s M. Navarro J.A. Go ́mez-Moreno C. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such a difference of 1 order of magnitude in their respective KD values could be indicative of two different types of exchanges for cytochrome c6 (one fast with cytochrome f, the other slow with PSI), although it exploits the same surface areas for the interactions with its two membrane partners. Formation of the cytochrome c6-PSI complex strongly depends on ionic strength, but such an ionic dependence is probably not the only factor explaining the large differences in exchange regime and lifetime between the two transient complexes. Also, the question still remains of how the redox state of cytochrome c6 can affect the stability of the transient complexes with its two partners so as to facilitate complex dissociation and turnover (34Bendall D.S. Bendall D.S. Protein Electron Transfer. Bios Scientific, Oxford1996: 43-68Google Scholar). The Interaction of Cytochrome c6 with PSI Trimers—The in vivo species of PSI embedded into the thylakoidal membrane is trimeric (19Ford R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 115-125Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 21: 909-917Crossref Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). When cytochrome c6 is not titrated with PSI monomers but with the physiological PSI trimers, most of the cytochrome c6 signals remain in the correlation spectrum (Fig. 6), with the exception of those being perturbed upon addition of PSI monomers. This finding could be due to the loss of sensitivity inherent to high molecular weight systems because relaxation is not eliminated during the insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer steps in TROSY experiments (6Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wu ̈thrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 11: 12366-12371Crossref Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). Thus, the signals that are specifically broadened in the presence of PSI monomers do not appear with PSI trimers. Most of the signals with PSI monomers are still visible with PSI trimers. This is so because we are observing the binding effects on the signals of free cytochrome c6 rather than on the signals of the bound form, as is the case in the long-living complexes GroEL-GroES (8Flaux J.

In this study, we describe a 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of a fully active fragment of PTPL1 encompassing the catalytic domain. PTPL1 adopts the standard PTP fold, albeit with an unusually positioned additional N-terminal helix, and shows an ordered phosphate in the active site. Interestingly, a positively charged pocket is located near the PTPL1 catalytic site, reminiscent of the second phosphotyrosine binding site in PTP1B, which is required to dephosphorylate peptides containing two adjacent phosphotyrosine residues (as occurs for example in the activated insulin receptor). We demonstrate that PTPL1, like PTP1B, interacts with and dephosphorylates a bis-phosphorylated insulin receptor peptide more efficiently than monophosphorylated peptides, indicating that PTPL1 may down-regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, by dephosphorylating insulin or growth factor receptors that contain tandem phosphotyrosines. The structure also reveals that four out of five PTPL1 mutations found in colorectal cancers are located on solvent-exposed regions remote from the active site, consistent with these mutants being normally active. In contrast, the fifth mutation, which changes Met-2307 to Thr, is close to the active site cysteine and decreases activity significantly.

The non-catalytic domain of PTPL1 does not appear to control PTPL1 activity directly as the isolated catalytic domain of PTPL1 possesses the same activity as full-length PTPL1 (4Kimber W.A. Deak M. Prescott A.R. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided initial evidence that PTPL1 may play a role in regulating PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and survival responses. This was first based on the finding that overexpression of PTPL1 in a breast cancer cell line induced the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate protein-1 (IRS1), resulting in inhibition of PI 3-kinase-regulated cell growth and survival responses (5Bompard G. Puech C. Prebois C. Vignon F. Freiss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47861-47869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cellular localization of PTPL1 was also found to be controlled by PI 3-kinase, through a PDZ domain-mediated interaction of PTPL1 with the phosphatidylinositol 3,4 bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) binding adaptor protein, TAPP1 (4Kimber W.A. Deak M. Prescott A.R. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Binding of TAPP1 to PTPL1 localizes PTPL1 in the cytosol, and following stimulation of cells with agonists, which elevate the level of PtdIns(3,4)P2, PTPL1 is recruited to the plasma membrane. More recently, a mutational analysis of colorectal cancers identified 19 different somatic mutations in PTPL1; eight mutations deleted the entire catalytic phosphatase domain, six point mutations were observed outside the catalytic domain, and five point mutations were located within the phosphatase domain (6Wang Z. Shen D. Parsons D.W. Bardelli A. Sager J. Szabo S. Ptak J. Silliman N. Peters B.A. van der Heijden M.S. Parmigiani G. Yan H. Wang T.L. Riggins G. Powell S.M. Willson J.K. Markowitz S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Velculescu V.E. Science. 2004; 304: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The effects that these mutations had on phosphatase activity were not analyzed in this study but nevertheless suggest that PTPL1 plays a role in regulating cancer-relevant growth and/or survival responses. Although numerous proteins have been proposed to interact with PTPL1 (reviewed in Ref. 3Erdmann K.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4789-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and certain proteins such IRS1 (5Bompard G. Puech C. Prebois C. Vignon F. Freiss G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)) have been characterized. All PTPs possess a common catalytic conformation, following the fold of PTP1B, the first PTP structure to be characterized (16Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). This is composed of a single domain, with the polypeptide chain organized into nine α-helices (termed α1′, α2′ at the N terminus followed by α1–7) and 12 β-strands (termed β1–12). The 12 β-strands adopt a highly twisted conformation spanning the entire length of the molecule and are located in the core of the structure, surrounded by the α-helices (16Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). All PTPs possess a catalytic nucleophilic cysteine that forms a covalent intermediate with the phosphate group. The catalytic cysteine is located in a region termed the PTP signature motif or phosphate binding loop and lies within a conserved His-Cys-Ser-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Gly-Arg-Thr/Ser-Gly sequence (where Xaa is any amino acid). This phosphate binding loop is located at the N terminus of the α4-helix in the core of the PTP fold. Another key region of the catalytic domain, the “WPD loop,” contains the catalytic acid (Asp-181), which protonates the phosphoester bond in the first step of the reaction (17Zhang Z.Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This is located between β11 and α3, positioned near the catalytic cysteine. The third key catalytic motif of PTPs, termed the Q loop, possesses a Gln residue that positions the nucleophilic water molecule appropriately to attack and hydrolyze the cysteine-phosphate intermediate. The Q loop is found between α5 and α6 and is located opposite the WPD loop. The best studied non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase is the PTP1B tyrosine phosphatase, which contributes to the down-regulation of the insulin signaling pathway by dephosphorylating and inactivating the insulin receptor. PTP1B possesses a catalytic domain and, in contrast to PTPL1, no other modular domain. In vitro, PTP1B dephosphorylates the insulin receptor efficiently (18Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and mice lacking PTP1B are sensitized to insulin (19Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor is activated by phosphorylation of 2 adjacent tyrosine residues (1162 and 1163), and structural analysis of the PTP1B catalytic domain (18Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) has revealed that PTP1B possess two phosphotyrosine binding sites that are required for PTP1B to bind and dephosphorylate the insulin receptor efficiently. One of the phosphotyrosine binding sites is located within the active site, and the other is located in a nearby positively charged pocket (18Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only PTP1B and the highly related TCPTP possess this second phosphotyrosine binding site. This observation suggests that PTP1B and TCPTP have evolved specifically to dephosphorylate the receptors for insulin and growth factors that contain two adjacent phosphotyrosine residues. To learn more about the potential roles of PTPL1, we have determined and analyzed the structure of the catalytic domain of PTPL1. Materials—Protease-inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and lysozyme were from Sigma, glutathione-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences, and BIOMOL Green reagent was from BIOMOL research laboratory (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The PreScission protease with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag was expressed by the protein production group of the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy Unit (University of Dundee, Scotland, UK) from a cDNA clone kindly provided by John Heath (University of Birmingham, UK). The mono-, bis-, and tris-phosphorylated peptides derived from the insulin receptor activation loop sequence TRDIYETDYYRK, in which phosphorylated residues are underlined, were synthesized using standard methodologies. General Methods and Buffers—Restriction enzyme digests, DNA ligations, site-directed mutagenesis, and other recombinant DNA procedures were performed using standard protocols. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). All DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, which was performed by the Sequencing Service, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee using DYEnamic ET terminator chemistry (Amersham Biosciences) on Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencers. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin employed as the standard. Lysis buffer contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mg/ml DNase, and Complete proteinase inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science; one tablet/25 ml). Buffer A is 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and Buffer B is 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The cDNA encoding full-length human PTPL1 (NCBI accession number NP_006255) was kindly provided by Dr C. H. Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Biomedical Centre, Uppsala, Sweden) and utilized as template to amplify by PCR reaction a number of different DNA fragments encoding residues of PTPL1 that encompass the catalytic domain that were tested for crystallization. For example, the construct that successfully crystallized encompassed residues 2152–2485 was amplified using primers (5′-ggatccatgaatgggaagttatcagaagagaga-3′ and 5′-gcggccgctcacttcagaagctgaggctgctgtttttg-3′). The resulting PCR product was ligated into pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned further as a BamHI-NotI fragment into pGex-6-P1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). This encodes for the Escherichia coli expression of the catalytic fragment of PTPL1 with an N-terminal GST affinity purification tag that can be cleaved following digestion with the PreScission protease. BL21 E. coli cells were transformed with the pGEX6-PTPL1 vector cultured in Luria-Bertani broth with 100 μg of ampicillin/ml and were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.8, 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the culture was grown at 26 °C for 16 h. Cells derived from 4 liters of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min, lysed by suspension in 200 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, and after incubation on ice for 30 min, were subjected to six cycles of sonication for 30 s each. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 4 ml of glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were then washed three times with 40 ml of Buffer A, washed three times with 40 ml of Buffer B, and finally washed twice with 40 ml of Buffer A. The resin was resuspended to a final volume of 15 ml of Buffer A, the amount of protein bound to the resin was estimated, and 50 μg of GST-tagged PreScission protease/mg of protein bound to the glutathione-Sepharose was added. After overnight (16 h) incubation at 4 °C in which the resin was gently mixed, eluted PTPL1 in the supernatant fraction was passed over 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads previously equilibrated in Buffer A to remove any remaining GST-PTPL1 or GST-PreScission protease. The eluted PTPL1 was then further purified on a Superdex 200 26/60 gel filtration column equilibrated against 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. PTPL1 purified in this manner was homogeneous as assessed by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry. Crystallization, Structure Solution, and Refinement—The purified PTPL1 was concentrated with a VivaScience concentrator until a concentration of 10 mg/ml was reached. Crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method. 0.75 μl of protein solution was mixed with 0.75 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m CAPS, pH 11, 1.7 m Na2HPO4, 0.4 m KH2PO4, and 0.2 m Li2SO4. Plate-shaped crystals grew in 16–20 h to a size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.50 mm. The crystals were cryoprotected with 3 m Li2SO4 before freezing. X-ray diffraction data were collected at The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France beamline BM14 and were processed with the HKL suite (19Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E.

A single solution was found with an R-factor of 0.49 and a correlation coefficient of 0.26. This solution was then used for automatic model building with warpNtrace (22Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar), which was able to build 292 out of 334 residues.

Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar) Kinetic Analysis of PTL1 Activity—Phosphatase activity was measured by monitoring hydrolysis of pNPP using a spectrophotometric assay that detects formation of the reaction product para-nitrophenol by absorbance of 405 nm (26Dickinson R.J. Williams D.J. Slack D.N. Williamson J. Seternes O.M. Keyse S.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or by monitoring the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor peptide substrate (TRDIYETDYYRK) phosphorylated at the indicated underlined tyrosine residues, equivalent to Tyr-1158, Tyr-1162, and Tyr-1163 on the insulin receptor. For the pNPP assay, 50 ng of purified PTPL1 was incubated in a 50-μl solution containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 3–100 mmpNPP, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were terminated after 15 min by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m NaOH, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm, using a Versa max absorbance plate reader with Softmax Pro 4.0 software (Molecular Devices). Rates or amounts of para-nitrophenol production were calculated using a standard curve generated from known amounts of para-nitrophenol. For the insulin receptor peptide assay, a 50-μl reaction was set up containing 10 ng of PTPL1 in a solution of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 3–500 μm the indicated tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide. After 10 min at room temperature, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of BIOMOL Green reagent, and after an additional 20 min, the amount of phosphate liberated was quantitated by absorbance at 620 nm and measured against inorganic phosphate standards. In all assays, we ensured that the rate of para-nitrophenol formation or the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor peptide was linear with time and that less than 10% of the substrate was consumed in the assay. The steady state kinetics parameters Km and kcat were determined from a direct fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the non-linear curve fitting Prism program (version 3, GraphPad Software, Inc.). All points were performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated at least two times to ensure that consistent results were obtained. The PTPL1 Structure—To identify the boundaries of a soluble fragment of the catalytic domain of PTPL1, a limited proteolysis approach was performed in which a fragment of PTPL1 encompassing residues 2087–2485 was digested with trypsin. This resulted in a proteolytically stable fragment comprising residues 2152–2485 (data not shown), encompassing the PTP domain with an additional 40 residues at the N terminus. We cloned and expressed this fragment of PTPL1 in E. coli and, following purification to homogeneity, it showed good stability and specific activity when assayed with either pNPP or the insulin receptor peptide substrate as compared with either full-length PTPL1 or the 2087–2485 fragment. This fragment of PTPL1 was readily crystallized using a high (>2 m) concentration of phosphate as the precipitant. Synchrotron diffraction data were collected to 1.85 Å resolution, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement followed by refinement to a final R-factor of 0.177 (Rfree = 0.205) (Table I). The structure contains two disordered loops encompassing the first 18 residues (2152–2170) and the final 8 residues (2477–2485). The PTPL1 phosphatase domain displays the classic PTP1B fold (16Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) described in the Introduction (Fig. 1). The only difference in secondary structure between PTPL1 and PTP1B is an additional α-helix (termed α0) located at the N terminus (Fig. 1A). The PTPL1 phosphate binding loop, containing the catalytic cysteine (Cys-2408), is located between β12 and α4, the WPD loop is located between β11 and α3, and the Q-loop is located between α5 and α6. These key catalytic residues are located at equivalent positions to all other PTPs crystallized to date. Interestingly, from the early stages of the refinement, well ordered, tetrahedral-shaped, electron density was observed near the Cys-2408 Sγ atom (Fig. 1A). As the crystallization mother liquor contained 2.1 m phosphate, the density was refined as a phosphate ion, and the structure is therefore likely to represent a product complex. The phosphate is situated at the amino terminus of α4. The three phosphate oxygen atoms facing the PTPL1 core form hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogens of residues Ala-2410, Ile-2412, Gly-2413, and Arg-2414, as well as to the guanidinium group of Arg-2414. The fourth oxygen projects toward the solvent and hydrogen-bonds with the catalytic acid Asp-2378 located 2.6 Å away, which is presumably protonated, like the equivalent residue in other PTPs such as PTP1B (17Zhang Z.Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, none of the receptor or non-receptor PTPs reported to date possess a phosphate at the catalytic site. Several PTPs have been crystallized with the phosphate mimetics vanadate and sulfate that are localized at a similar position to the phosphate group on PTPL1 (27Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Vihko P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol.

Saper M.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is believed that the WPD loop in PTPs moves into a “closed” conformation when substrates bind (31Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Comparison of the structure of PTPL1 with PTP1B complexed to the insulin receptor substrate peptide (18Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) suggests that the WPD loop in the PTPL1 structure is in the closed substrate-bound conformation. Comparison with PTP1B, Helix Swapping—Although the overall fold of PTPL1 is similar to that of PTP1B, there is one remarkable difference. In PTP1B, the α7 helix is located at the C terminus of the protein and buries helix α3 (Fig. 1B). In PTPL1, however, the situation is markedly different. Helix α7 does not exist (the PTPL1 structure ends with helix α6), but the PTPL1 α0 helix, located at the N terminus, occupies a topologically equivalent position to helix α7 in PTP1B, also interacting with helix α3. For instance, residue Leu-192 on helix α3 of PTP1B forms a hydrophobic interaction with residue Trp-291 on helix α7, whereas the equivalent Leu-2389 on helix α3 in PTPL1 interacts with Tyr-2466 in helix α0. Structure-based sequence alignment of PTPL1 with PTP1B and three other structurally characterized PTPs shows that the N-terminal residues of PTPL1 that form α0 do not align with the other PTPs (Fig. 2). To investigate the importance of the α0 helix, we compared the catalytic activities of the PTPL1 construct that was crystallized (residues 2152–2485) with a fragment of PTPL1 lacking the α0 helix, termed Δα0-PTPL1 (residues 2209–2485) (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, although this form of PTPL1 was well expressed, it possessed the same very low catalytic activity as a PTPL1 mutant in which the catalytic Cys-2408 had been mutated to Ser (Fig. 2B). These findings are consistent with the notion that α0 helix plays a crucial role in stabilizing PTPL1 in a correctly folded and active conformation. 2C. S. Bond, personal communication. A Second Phosphotyrosine Binding Pocket—All residues that contact the ordered phosphate in the PTPL1 active site are conserved with PTP1B (16Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 18Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol.

As discussed in the Introduction, structural analysis of PTP1B complexed with the insulin receptor peptide substrate phosphorylated at 3 tyrosines has revealed that PTP1B possesses a secondary phosphotyrosine binding site in a positively charged pocket next to the active site (18Salmeen A"

Elongin A (EloA) is the largest subunit of the Elongin complex that can increase the catalytic rate of mRNA synthesis by Pol II. We recently demonstrated that the Elongin A homologue in Drosophila, dEloA, is essential and has properties consistent with those of a Pol II elongation factor in vivo. The goal of this study was to test whether dEloA is required for heat shock gene transcription, since heat shock gene expression is thought to be controlled at the level of Pol II elongation. Here, we demonstrate that dEloA is rapidly recruited to heat shock loci with Pol II in response to heat shock. Furthermore, through the use of RNA interference in vivo, we show that dEloA is required for the proper expression of one of these genes, HSP70, and that its requirement for heat shock gene expression is exerted after the initiation of transcription at heat shock loci.

The Elongin complex was originally purified based on its ability to stimulate Pol II 1The abbreviations used are: Pol II, polymerase II; RNAi, RNA interference; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: Pol II, polymerase II; RNAi, RNA interference; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. elongation in an in vitro transcription elongation assay (1Bradsher J.N. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elongin is a heterotrimeric complex, consisting of A, B, and C subunits, which are ∼110, 18, and 15 kilodaltons in size, respectively. Elongin A is the transcriptionally active subunit of the complex, and the addition of this protein alone to in vitro transcription reactions is sufficient to stimulate transcription elongation by Pol II (1Bradsher J.N. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Aso T. Haque D. Barstead R.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

In the absence of Elongin A, Elongin BC is unable to enhance Pol II processivity. A number of Elongin A family members have been identified. They include three mammalian homologues (Elongin A, A2, and A3) and an Elongin A homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans (1Bradsher J.N. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Aso T. Yamazaki K. Amimoto K. Kuroiwa A. Higashi H. Matsuda Y. Kitajima S. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26444-26451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Each of these proteins is capable of stimulating Pol II elongation in vitro and interacting with the Elongin BC complex. Recently, we identified and characterized the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of Elongin A, named dEloA (14Gerber M. Eissenberg J.C. Kong S. Tenney K. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9911-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Like the other Elongin A family members, dEloA stimulates Pol II elongation activity in vitro. Additionally, dEloA is concentrated at transcriptionally active loci on Drosophila polytene chromosomes, and it colocalizes extensively with transcriptionally active isoforms of Pol II. Consistent with this observation, dEloA interacts with Pol II in Drosophila extracts. Collectively, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the Elongin proteins are Pol II-associated factors in vivo. Heat shock gene expression is thought to be controlled at the level of promoter clearance (16Lis J.T. Wu C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expression of heat shock genes should be particularly sensitive to the cellular level of Pol II elongation factors. A variety of Pol II elongation factors are recruited to sites of heat shock gene expression during heat shock (6Andrulis E.D. Guzman E. Doring P. Werner J. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2635-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Gerber M. Ma J. Dean K. Eissenberg J.C. Shilatifard A.

Andrulis E.D. Nakayama T. Hirose S. Reinberg D. Lis J.T. Science. 2003; 301: 1094-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the role(s) of these factors in the regulation of heat shock gene transcription. To examine the role of EloA in the regulation of specific gene expression, we tested the requirement for this Pol II elongation factor during the heat shock response in an animal model system. In this study, we show that dEloA is rapidly recruited to heat shock loci in response to heat shock and strongly colocalizes with phosphorylated Pol II at these sites. Using RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of dEloA, we demonstrate that organisms with reduced levels of dEloA exhibit a marked reduction in HSP70 mRNA levels following heat shock. The data presented here provide strong evidence that dEloA is required for efficient expression of the HSP70 genes in vivo and are the first demonstration that a member of this class of elongation factors plays a critical role in heat shock gene expression in an animal model system. Characterization of dEloA Polyclonal Antiserum—Recombinant dEloA was prepared as described previously (14Gerber M. Eissenberg J.C. Kong S. Tenney K. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9911-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and was used for Western blot analysis with either preimmune serum (1:5000 dilution in 1× Tris-buffered saline-Tween) or dEloA polyclonal antiserum (same dilution). Blots were then incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody with a peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and developed via chemiluminescent detection (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—Salivary glands from late third-in-star larvae were fixed for 30 s in 2% formaldehyde in gland buffer, then in 45% acetic acid 2% formaldehyde for 3 min as described (9Lis J.T. Mason P. Peng J. Price D.H. Werner J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 792-803PubMed Google Scholar), before storage in 67% glycerol/33% PBS at –20 °C. For optimal staining, dEloA polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution) was incubated with polytene chromosomes overnight at 4 °C. Pol II monoclonal antibodies (H5 and H14, Covance) were used at 1:1000 dilution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Appropriate secondary antibodies (The Jackson Laboratory, anti-rabbit-Cy2 conjugate and anti-mouse μ-chain Cy3 conjugate) were used at 1:1000 dilution. Fluorescence detection was by epifluorescence using an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope with an NB barrier filter for fluorescein and Cy2 detection and a WG barrier filter for rhodamine and Cy3. Images were recorded with a SPOT CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) using PAX-it™ imaging software (Midwest Information Systems, Inc.). Northern Blot Analysis—D. melanogaster third-instar larvae (10 each of Oregon R, daughterless Gal4 control, and dEloA RNAi) were heat-shocked at 37 °C for 40 min. Total RNA was isolated from each set of larvae using the RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen). In an effort to control for genetic background effects, males carrying an X-linked Sym-pUAST-dEloA transgene were crossed to females carrying the daughterless Gal4 driver. Control male and RNAi female progeny (third-instar larvae) were separated. As described above, 10 males and 10 females were heat-shocked, and total RNA was isolated. As a negative control for HSP70 transcription, total RNA was also isolated from 10 male and 10 female non-heat-shocked third-instar larvae. Ten micrograms of these total RNAs were denatured in MOPS/formaldehyde/formamide solution and separated by electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde gel at low voltage. Resolved RNAs were transferred to a Biotrans membrane (ICN) and cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. The membrane was incubated in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 3.5% SDS, 150 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2× Denhardts) for at least 1 h at 65 °C before the addition of radiolabeled probe. Antisense RNA probes were prepared using pGEM vector containing either HSP70 cDNA or rp49 cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter at the 3′ end (kindly provided by Dale Dorsett, Saint Louis University School of Medicine). Antisense RNA transcription was performed using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) under the following reaction conditions: 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5 mm concentration each of ATP, GTP, and UTP, 0.5 μCi of [32P]CTP (ICN), 0.1 unit of RNAsin (Promega), and 2 μg of template DNA. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 45 min and then treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega) for 15 min to remove plasmid template. Antisense RNA was then purified using the RNeasy RNA purification kit (Qiagen), added to the hybridization mixture, and incubated overnight at 65 °C. The blot was then washed successively in buffers containing decreasing concentrations of SSC and SDS until background radiation levels reached a minimum. Transcripts were visualized by autoradiography. Elongin A Associates with Heat Shock Puff Sites in Response to Environmental Stress—In Drosophila, heat shock results in a dramatic relocalization of Pol II from a widely distributed collection of transcriptionally active loci to a select few vigorously transcribed heat shock gene loci (11Greenleaf A.L. Plagens U. Jamrich M. Bautz E.K. Chromosoma. 1978; 65: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previous reports have demonstrated that several Drosophila elongation factors, including P-TEFb, Spt4 and -5, Spt6, FACT, and dELL, are mobilized to heat shock loci (6Andrulis E.D. Guzman E. Doring P. Werner J. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2635-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Gerber M. Ma J. Dean K. Eissenberg J.C. Shilatifard A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6104-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Kaplan C.D. Morris J.R. Wu C.-T. Winston F.

Using a specific anti-dEloA polyclonal antibody that we have developed (Fig. 1), we compared the immunolocalization pattern of dEloA under heat shock and non-heat shock conditions. Prior to heat shock, dEloA is widely distributed on polytene chromosomes. Following a 20-min heat shock at 37 °C, dEloA is rapidly and dramatically relocalized to a small number of induced puff sites (compare Fig. 2, A and B). Using phase-contrast microscopy, we mapped these loci and identified them as heat shock puffs (Fig. 2C). To determine that dEloA is not associated with heat shock loci prior to heat shock, polytene chromosomes isolated from animals before and after heat shock were mapped for the recruitment of dEloA. As shown in Fig. 2, D and E, dEloA is recruited to 87A and 87C loci upon heat shock and is not found to be associated with these loci before heat shock induction.Fig. 1Characterization of dEloA polyclonal antibody. A, Western blot analysis of recombinant dEloA (rdEloA) protein with preimmune serum (left panel) and dEloA polyclonal antibody (right panel). The amount of protein loaded in each lane is indicated. dEloA polyclonal yields a robust signal at the expected molecular weight, while preimmune serum yields a background signal. Both preimmune serum and dEloA antiserum were used at a 1:5000 dilution.

The amount of total protein loaded is indicated for each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) dEloA Colocalizes with Phosphorylated Pol II at Heat Shock Puffs—Isoforms of RNA Pol II that are phosphorylated at Ser2 of the large subunit heptapeptide repeat are thought to be the elongating isoforms of polymerase in vivo (13Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). To test whether dEloA is colocalized with elongating Pol II, we compared the distribution of dEloA and Ser2-phospho-Pol II on chromosomes following heat shock. As expected, dEloA and hyperphosphorylated Pol II colocalize on heat-shocked chromosomes (Fig. 3, A–C), demonstrating that dEloA is mobilized together with Pol II to sites of active transcription. These data, in addition to our in vitro studies, support a role for dEloA as a transcription elongation factor in vivo, specifically with respect to heat shock gene expression. dEloA Is Required for Heat Shock Gene Expression—Given the strong recruitment of dEloA to heat shock loci upon induction, we examined the potential requirement for dEloA in the transcription of heat shock genes following heat shock. We utilized RNAi to reduce the levels of dEloA in developing flies. As shown in Fig. 4A, RNAi targeting of dEloA transcript dramatically reduces dEloA levels on polytene chromosomes. In contrast, the levels of phosphorylated Pol II appear very similar to wild-type levels, suggesting that loss of dEloA does not affect global RNA Pol II protein levels, phosphorylation levels, or distribution. Also, the level of dEloA protein tested by Western analysis in the same animals indicated that the induction of dEloA RNAi results in the reduction of dEloA protein level (Fig. 4B). To further characterize the role of dEloA in heat shock gene expression, adult males carrying an X-linked Sym-pUAST-dEloA transgene were crossed to virgin females carrying the daGal4 driver. In the progeny obtained from this cross, the RNAi is activated against dEloA only in females; therefore, the majority of females are unable to survive to adulthood, because the expression of Elongin A is required for viability (14Gerber M. Eissenberg J.C. Kong S. Tenney K. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9911-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We tested whether the expression of HSP70 in response to heat-shock differs between male and female progeny from this cross. As predicted, HSP70 transcription in heat-shocked females with RNAi-mediated depletion of dEloA is markedly reduced in comparison to their heat-shocked male siblings lacking the Sym-pUAST-dEloA transgene necessary for RNAi (Fig. 4C). These data, taken together with the localization studies, strongly suggest that dEloA is required for efficient expression of HSP70 during heat shock response. While these observations are consistent with previous reports that mammalian Elongin A is limiting for the expression of specific genes (12Yamazaki K. Aso T. Ohnishi Y. Ohno M. Tamura K. Shuin T. Kitajima S. Nakabeppu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13585-13589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), our data also suggest a direct effect of dEloA levels on the efficiency of HSP70 expression, since dEloA is specifically recruited to the loci where transcription of HSP70 occurs during heat shock. The exact role of Elongin A in the regulation of transcriptional elongation in vivo has remained elusive. In vitro transcriptional studies have suggested that Elongin functions by increasing the catalytic rate of transcription elongation and altering the Vmax of transcription (14Gerber M. Eissenberg J.C. Kong S. Tenney K. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9911-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This transcriptional elongation effect is exerted on Pol II after the synthesis of a message of about 10–20 nucleotides in length (14Gerber M. Eissenberg J.C. Kong S. Tenney K. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9911-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our in vivo studies support a role for this elongation factor with the elongating form of Pol II. To begin to understand the function of Elongin A in the transcription cycle in an in vivo model system, we performed immunostaining to detect Serine phosphorylated Pol II on heat-shocked chromosomes from wild-type control third-instar larvae and larvae in which RNAi had been activated against dEloA message (Fig. 5.). Our study demonstrated that the recruitment of Pol II to heat shock puff sites is not significantly lowered when dEloA levels are reduced by RNAi (Fig. 5). This observation suggests that perhaps dEloA is not involved in the recruitment Pol II and initiation of transcription but rather plays an important role after initiation of transcription of heat shock genes, since reduction of its levels results in defects in heat shock gene expression. Under non-heat shock conditions, Pol II on the HSP70 gene in Drosophila is found in a poised position bound to DNA about forty nucleotides downstream of the promoter (10O'Brien T. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5285-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Rougvie A.E. Lis J.T. Cell. 1988; 54: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The HSP70 gene activation appears to involve the release of the poised Pol II from the promoter proximal regions during the early stages of transcription elongation. Given the biochemical activity of EloA as an RNA polymerase II elongation factor in vitro, we hypothesize that dEloA is a limiting factor in HSP70 gene expression because it is required for the efficient transition of Pol II into its elongation phase. In this paper, we have demonstrated that (a) the Pol II elongation factor dEloA is rapidly recruited to heat shock puff sites with Pol II in response to heat shock; (b) reduction of dEloA levels via RNAi results in reduction of heat shock gene expression, indicating the requirement of dEloA for proper heat shock gene expression in a developing organism; and (c) in vivo, dEloA plays a role in the regulation of heat shock gene expression after initiation of transcription at the heat shock loci. Collectively, our data demonstrate, for the first time, the requirement of any Pol II elongation factor for proper heat shock gene expression in a developing organism. Future comparative studies on the role of Elongin A and other Pol II elongation factors identified at the heat shock puff sites should clarify the specific in vivo role of each of these factors in proper heat shock gene expression and why they are recruited to heat shock loci upon stimulation. Such studies will also determine whether Pol II elongation factors can also be involved in processes such as transcriptional termination, RNA processing, and transport in higher metazoa.

The expression of PDGF-D in the eye is tissue-specific. In the anterior segment, it is localized to iris and ciliary body, whereas in the retina, PDGF-D is restricted to the outer plexiform layer. PDGF-D is present in aqueous humor but is not detectable in mature lens or in mouse lens-derived αTN4-1 cells. However, it is expressed in rabbit lens-derived N/N1003A cells.

Immunopurified PDGF-D also stimulates cell proliferation in rat lens explants and in NIH 3T3 cells. In organ culture of rat eye anterior segments, anti-PDGF-D strongly inhibits lens epithelial cell proliferation. This finding suggests a major in vivo role for PDGF-D in the mechanisms of coordinated growth of eye tissues.

An anterior monolayer of relatively undifferentiated epithelium contains a central region of quiescent cells surrounded by zones of cells that proliferate and migrate toward the lens equator. The proliferative zone is demarcated by the posterior chamber of the aqueous humor bounded by the lens, the lens zonules, the ciliary body, and the iris. As migrating epithelial cells reach the equator of the lens and leave the posterior chamber, they come under the influence of factors secreted into the vitreous (12McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. de I.R.U. Hales A.M. Lovicu F.J. Eye. 1999; 13: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this differentiation zone, migration and proliferation cease and the epithelial cells reorganize and elongate to form layers of fiber cells that reach half-way around the lens, express high levels of crystallins, and make up most of the refractive structure of the lens.

The closest sequence relative of PDGF-D is another protein variously known as fallotein, spinal cord-derived growth factor A, or PDGF-C (27Tsai Y.J. Lee R.K. Lin S.P. Chen Y.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Both of these newly identified proteins have an N-terminal CUB domain, an immunoglobulin-like protein interaction module (30Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol.

Symp. 1990; 150: 6-22PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant PDGF-D has been studied in cell culture systems, and both proteolytically cleaved and fulllength proteins have been shown to have activity, including proliferative, transforming, and angiogenic activities, mediated through PDGFRβ and PDGFRα/β receptors (24LaRochelle W.J.

Here we describe the localization of PDGF-D in the eye and its effects on lens epithelial cell proliferation.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibody Production—A peptide from human PDGF-D (IEGFp1, KSKVDLDRLNDDAKRYSC) was synthesized at BIOSOURCE/QCB (Hopkinton, MA), conjugated to carrier, and used to immunize rabbits. Antiserum was tested on Western blots. The most potent bleeds were affinity-purified at BIOSOURCE.Western Blots—Proteins were extracted from rat eye tissues in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). For cell-conditioned medium, cells were grown overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2, washed three times with serum-free medium, and grown overnight in serum-free medium. Conditioned medium was collected at 0 and 21 h and concentrated using Amicon YM10 filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Bovine aqueous humor was extracted from 12-18-month-old bovine eyes using a Hamilton syringe. The eyes were obtained through J. W. Treuth & Sons (Baltimore, MD).For Western blots, 10-μg protein samples (or 30 μg for aqueous humor) were run in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blots were processed following the protocols of the Western Breeze chemiluminescent Western blot kit (Invitrogen). Blots were incubated with anti-PDGF-D primary antibody (IEGFp1) diluted 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody was also biotinylated using EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). The biotinylated antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution in Western blots and visualized with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) and Supersignal West Pico substrate (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocols.PCR and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from newborn rat lens epithelium, lens fibers, and iris and from rabbit N/N1003A cells. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primer at 42 °C for 1 h. RT-PCR amplifications were performed with High Fidelity TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) at an annealing temperature of 55 °C using specific primers as follows: PDGFRα, (PDGFRA-1, 5′-GGGCCTTACATCTGTGAGGCCACCGT-3′; PDGFRA-2, 5′-TTAGCCCGGATCAGCTTTAATTTGCT-3′); PDGFRβ (PDGFRB-3, 5′-ATGGCCCCAGAGAGCATCTTCAACAG-3′; PDGFRB-4, 5′-CCTCAGAAACTCCTCATCCACCTGCT-3′); Flt1 (FLT1-1, 5′-TCCTCACTTGCACCGTGTATGGCATC-3′; FLT1-2, 5′-GATGACAAGGTTCAGAGTGATGGAGT-3′); Flt3 (FLT3-3, 5′-ACGAGGGTGAAAGAGAGGCGCTCATG-3′; FLT3-4, 5′-AAGGAGGTCTTCAAACGTCAGCACGT-3′); and Flk1 (MFlk2575S, 5′-GCCAATGAAGGGGAACTGAAGAC-3′; MFlk3111AS, 5′-CTGGCTGCTGGTTATGCTGTC-3′).Total RNA was prepared from N/N1003A cells (32Reddan J.R. Chepelinsky A.B. Dziedzic D.C. Piatigorsky J. Goldenberg E.M. Differentiation. 1986; 33: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and αTN4-1 cells (33Yamada T. Nakamura T. Westphal H. Russell P. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and RT-PCR amplification was performed using primers from conserved regions of human and mouse PDGF-D (IEGF1b, 5′-GATGAGAGCAATCACCTCACAGACTTG3-′; IEGF3a, 5′-TTATCGAGGTGGTCTTGAGCTGCAGAT-3′).Immunofluorescence (IF) Localization—10-μm frozen sections from 2-day-old rat eye, adult rat, and adult monkey were taken on Superfrost/Plus slides (Daigger, Wheeling, IL), dried at room temperature, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Slides were incubated with anti-PDGF-D in blocking buffer at 1:300 or 1:400 dilution and treated with either goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (1:400). After washing, slides were incubated with 4 nm DAPI (D-3571, Molecular Probes).Conditioned Media and Immunodepletion—N/N1003A cells (32Reddan J.R. Chepelinsky A.B. Dziedzic D.C. Piatigorsky J. Goldenberg E.M. Differentiation. 1986; 33: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium with l-glutamine (Sigma) containing 8% rabbit serum (Invitrogen) and gentamycin. αTN4-1 cells (33Yamada T. Nakamura T. Westphal H. Russell P. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM with l-glutamine containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Conditioned media were collected after 21-h serum starvation. 1 ml of conditioned media was incubated with 1 μg of anti-PDGF-D antibody or normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h. 50 μl of 50% protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with the antigen-antibody complex at 4 °C for 1 h. Complexes were precipitated by centrifugation. The supernatant (depleted medium) was removed.Immunopurification of PDGF-D—Anti-PDGF-D antibody was cross-linked to protein A beads using the Seize-X immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). 15 ml of N/N1003A cell-conditioned medium was concentrated to 1 ml by YM10 filtration (Millipore) and immunoprecipitated using the cross-linked antibody, and bound PDGF-D was eluted.Cell Survival and Proliferation in Lens Explants—Lens epithelial explants were dissected from newborn rat eyes (14Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Five explants were placed in individual wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate and treated with 200 μl of conditioned medium from N/N1003A cells, conditioned medium from αTN4-1 cells, N/N1003A medium immunodepleted for PDGF-D, or N/N1003A medium mock-immunodepleted by normal IgG. Each treatment was performed in triplicate. Explants were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Cell survival was measured using trypan blue (Invitrogen). Explants in a 96-well tissue culture plate were cultured as above. Plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g at 4 °C. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged in minimum Eagle's medium, and incubated for 5 min with trypan blue at room temperature. Live and dead cells, as judged by staining, were counted using a hemocytometer.For the proliferation assay, explants were treated in the same way. Proliferation assays were performed using the BrdUrd labeling kit III (Roche Applied Science). 10 μm BrdUrd was added at 21 h and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were fixed with 0.5 m ethanol/HCl and incubated with nucleases. Incorporated BrdUrd was detected with monoclonal anti-BrdUrd-POD Fab fragments using the soluble chromogenic substrate (2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) measuring absorbance 405 nm.For testing immunoprecipitation (IP)-purified PDGF-D, explants were taken as before, incubated with 200 μl of medium (minimum Eagle's medium + penicillin/streptomycin), and treated with two different concentrations of IP-purified PDGF-D. Cell survival and proliferation were assayed in triplicate as before.Proliferation Assay on NIH 3T3 Cells—NIH 3T3 cells were grown in 96-well plates in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum/penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight. They were changed to medium with 1% fetal bovine serum and grown overnight again. Cells were treated for 21 h with 100 ng/ml PDGF-A, PDGF-B (Roche Applied Science), and IP-purified rabbit PDGF-D with or without the addition of the appropriate antibody (PDGF-A and PDGF-B antibodies from R&D, Benicia, CA) at dilutions of 1:200, 1:100, and 1:50. Proliferation was assayed using the BrdUrd labeling kit III.Anterior Segment Organ Culture—Whole anterior segments were dissected from newborn rat eyes. Five anterior segments were placed in each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate and incubated with DMEM/F-12 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine/1 mm ascorbic acid/penicillin/streptomycin in the presence of antibodies to PDGF-A, PDGF-B (R&D), FGF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and PDGF-D at a 1:100 dilution for 21 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Lens epithelia were dissected, and proliferation was assayed by BrdUrd incorporation as before.RESULTSExpression of PDGF-D in Eye Tissues and Cultured Cells—A peptide antibody (designated IEGFp1) was designed to target a region of the growth factor-like domain of the human PDGF-D sequence that was predicted to be both antigenic and specific and to represent a core functional region in case of a loss of other regions by post-translational processing (Fig. 1). In Western blots of adult rat eye tissues, the anti-PDGF-D antibody detected protein in the iris, cornea, and retina (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the expression in lens was very low or absent. Although there was some minor size heterogeneity among different eye tissues, the immunoreactive protein was consistent in size with full-sized glycosylated PDGF-D (∼50 kDa), rather than with proteolytically cleaved fragments. To test for the presence of PDGF-D in the aqueous humor, bovine eyes were used to overcome the difficulty in obtaining this fluid cleanly from rodent eyes. The antibody retained its activity across species, and apparently full-sized PDGF-D was also detected in bovine aqueous humor (Fig. 2B). As a control, the antibody was also used to test the aqueous sample for a known aqueous marker, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (34Apte R.S. Sinha D. Mayhew E. Wistow G.J. Niederkorn J.Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5693-5696PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2PDGF-D in eye tissues and lens-derived cells.

Blot for N/N1003A cell-conditioned medium used biotinylated primary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Conditioned media from two lens-derived cell lines were also tested for PDGF-D (Fig. 2C). Mouse lens-derived αTN4-1 cells, which are transformed with SV40 T-antigen (33Yamada T. Nakamura T. Westphal H. Russell P. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), gave no reaction, but non-transformed rabbit lens-derived N/N1003A cells (32Reddan J.R. Chepelinsky A.B. Dziedzic D.C. Piatigorsky J. Goldenberg E.M. Differentiation. 1986; 33: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were positive. Because the rabbit cells are grown in the presence of rabbit serum, the cells were washed three times, transferred to serum-free medium, and tested by Western blot at 0 and 24 h after transfer to serum-free conditions using biotin-labeled anti-PDGF-D to avoid secondary antibody detection of any contaminating rabbit IgG heavy chains. No PDGF-D was detected at 0 h, but full-sized PDGF-D was detected in the medium after 24 h. To confirm the expression of rabbit PDGF-D in N/N1003A cells, intron-crossing PCR primers were designed from the conserved regions of human and mouse sequences and used to amplify PDGF-D transcripts by RT-PCR from mouse lens and from the lens-derived cells. Consistent with previous results, no product was obtained from mouse lens or αTN4-1 cells but a 900-bp cDNA fragment for rabbit PDGF-D was obtained from N/N1003A cells (data not shown). This was cloned and sequenced to confirm the identity and to provide partial sequence for the rabbit protein (Gen-Bank™ accession AY347260).The anti-PDGF-D antibody was used in immunofluorescence analysis of sections of rodent and monkey eye tissues (Figs. 3, 4, 5). In newborn rat anterior segment (Fig. 3), specific staining was seen in the iris and ciliary body but not in the lens, whereas limbal cells of the corneal epithelium also gave a positive reaction. Staining was intense in the stroma of both ciliary body and iris but was also present in the epithelial cell layers. To see whether similar expression is present in primate eyes, adult monkey anterior segment was also examined by immunofluorescence. In ciliary body (Fig. 4A), there was again intense stain in the muscle layer and significant staining throughout the epithelium. Intense staining was also seen in the sphincter muscle of the iris and in an apparently connected layer basal to the pigmented epithelium (Fig. 4B). There was no obvious stain in the intensely pigmented cells themselves. This could either reflect the absence from these cells in the adult monkey iris or possibly the quenching of a weaker signal by melanin. Overall, these results show that PDGF-D is differentially expressed in the anterior segment in both rodent and primate eye in a pattern that is consistent with a role in lens growth through secretion into the posterior chamber.Fig. 3Immunofluorescence-staining pattern for newborn rat eye anterior segment. A, panels on the left show IF using the anti-PDGF-D antibody (top) and no primary antibody control (bottom). Panels on the right show DAPI staining of cell nuclei for the same sections.

In the mature adult rat retina (Fig. 5), this expression localizes intensely to the outer plexiform layer, which contains photoreceptor axons and the synaptic layer between photoreceptors and second order neurons.Expression of Receptors for PDGF/VEGF Family Members in Lens—Previous results have shown that PDGF-D, in contrast to PDGF-A, acts mainly through the PDGFRβ receptor (24LaRochelle W.J. Jeffers M. McDonald W.F. Chillakuru R.A. Giese N.A. Lokker N.A. Sullivan C. Boldog F.L. Yang M. Vernet C. Burgess C.E. Fernandes E. Deegler L.L. Rittman B. Shimkets J. Shimkets R.A. Rothberg J.M.

Rat eye tissues were examined for the expression of PDGFRβ and for several other receptors for members of the VEGF/PDGF family using RT-PCR (Fig. 6). Primers were designed for rat sequences taken from GenBank™ and dbEST for PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, FLT1 (VEGFR1), FLT3, and FLK1 (VEGFR2) receptors. The products of the expected size for all five receptors were detected in total RNA extracted from newborn rat lens epithelium, lens fibers, and iris, whereas no RT controls were blank. Bands were sequenced to confirm their identity. The same primers were also used on RNA from the rabbit lens-derived cell line. Positive results were obtained for PDGFRβ and for FLT3 (Fig. 6). The failure of the other primers to work may reflect differences in the (unknown) rabbit sequences for these receptors.Fig. 6Expression of PDGF/VEGF family receptors in rat lens, iris, and rabbit N/N1003A cells. RT-PCR products for different receptor visualizations by agarose gel electrophoresis are shown. Size marker lanes are shown at the left of each panel. The panels show results for newborn rat lens epithelium, fibers, iris and, N/N1003A cells as indicated. In each panel, the receptor amplified is indicated as follows: PDGFRα (a); PDGFRβ (b); FLT1 (t1); FLK1 (k1), t3, and FLT3. A representative no RT control lane (for PDGFRα and epithelium) is indicated by “-” in the top panel. Blank and repetitive lanes have been deleted and assembled from different gels run under the same conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of PDGF-D on Cell Survival and Lens Cell Proliferation in Explants—Given the pattern of expression of PDGF-D in both newborn and adult anterior segment, the presence of secreted PDGF-D in the aqueous humor of the bovine eye, and the presence of appropriate receptor expression in lens epithelium, the effects of PDGF-D on lens epithelial cell proliferation were examined. N/N1003A cell-conditioned medium was used as a source of native PDGF-D. Newborn rat lens epithelial explants were dissected and cultured. Cell survival was examined by trypan blue staining in explants at 0 and 21 h after incubation in N/N1003A-conditioned medium, conditioned medium immunodepleted using the anti-PDGF-D antibody, mock-depleted medium, and conditioned medium from αTN4-1 cells (Fig. 7A). Lens epithelial cells in culture have previously been shown to produce an unidentified cell survival factor and to be able to survive in minimal medium (35Ishizaki Y. Voyvodic J.T. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 121: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). After 21 h, both conditioned and depleted media retained a 75-80% number of live cells seen at 0 h with an increased number of dead cells. However, there is a distinct enhancement of cell survival in N/N1003A-conditioned medium compared with depleted medium (essentially serum-free medium) or αTN4-1 medium, suggesting that PDGF-D has survival activity in this system.Fig. 7Effect of PDGF-D on cell proliferation in lens epithelial explants.

https://openalex.org/W1992085369,"Membrane-bound proteases play several important roles in protein quality control and regulation. In the genome of the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus horikoshii, the open reading frames PH1510 and PH1511 are homologous to the genes nfed (nodulation formation efficiency D) and stomatin, respectively, and probably form an operon. The nfed proteins are putative membrane proteins, and the N-terminal region shows homology to ClpP-type serine proteases. Stomatin is one of the major integral membrane proteins of human erythrocytes, and its absence is associated with the hemolytic anemia known as hereditary stomatocytosis. Thus, the N-terminal region of PH1510 (1510-N, residues 16–236) was expressed and purified. From activity staining and SDS-PAGE analysis using fluorescein isothiocyanate-casein, 1510-N was identified as a thermostable endo-type protease. From site-directed mutagenesis, the conserved Ser-97 and Lys-138 are involved in proteolysis and, therefore, PH1510 is probably a serine protease with a catalytic Ser-Lys dyad. The sites of cleavage by 1510-N are rich in hydrophobic residues. The site P1 (position –1 relative to the cleavage site) is mainly leucine. P4 and P4′ are mainly hydrophobic residues. Interestingly, the 1510-N protease cleaves the C-terminal hydrophobic region of PH1511. From this result and the probability of an operon, PH1510 probably functions in cooperation with PH1511. It is hypothesized that the cleavage of the stomatin-homolog PH1511 by the PH1510 protease causes an ion channel to open.

The hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus horikoshii grows optimally at ∼100 °C, and its entire genome sequence has been determined by the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation of Japan (1Kawarabayashi Y.

The highly thermostable gene products are expected to have industrial applications. Protein degradation plays several important roles in protein quality control and regulation (2Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 565-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In mitochondrial membranes, a quality control system is present that removes nonassembled polypeptides and prevents their possibly deleterious accumulation in the membrane (3Arnold I. Langer T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Several membrane-bound proteases have been characterized. In Escherichia coli FtsH was identified as an ATP-dependent membrane-bound protease and investigated concisely by functional and structural analyses (2Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 565-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In Archaea, the Lon protease from Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 has been characterized as membrane-bound in contrast to the E. coli Lon protease, which is soluble (4Fukui T. Eguchi T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3689-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because the archaeal FtsH homolog has not yet been identified, the Lon protease might play important roles in the archaeal membrane like the bacterial FtsH does. Stomatin is one of the major integral membrane proteins of human erythrocytes, and its absence is associated with the hemolytic anemia known as hereditary stomatocytosis. Stomatin is thought to function as a negative regulator of univalent cation permeability (5Stewart G.W. Argent A.C. Dash B.C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1225: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Its gene homologs are identified in almost all species of eukaryotes, eubacteria, and Archaea (6Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Kyrpides N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that stomatin-like genes in prokaryotes (p-stomatin) and nfed 1The abbreviations used are: nfed, nodulation formation efficiency D; DDM, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; 1510-N, residues 16–236 of PH1510; 1510-C, residues 371–441 of PH1510; 1511-N, residues 69–234 of PH1511; 1511-C, residues 189–266 of PH1511. (nodulation formation efficiency D) genes probably form an operon in at least 19 organisms (7Green J.B. Fricke B. Chetty M.C. von Du ̈ring M. Preston G.F. Stewart G.W. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The nfed protein was originally identified as an ornithine cyclodeaminase (8Soto M.J. Zorzano A. García-Rodriguez F.M. Mercado-Blanco J. López-Lara I.M. Olivares J. Toro N. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, this enzyme is not related to the p-stomatin partner gene that is indicated here as “nfed,” which is mislabeled in the major data bases (7Green J.B. Fricke B. Chetty M.C. von Du ̈ring M.

According to sequences of the p-stomatin partner gene nfed, the proteins have putative membrane-spanning segments, and the N termini of the proteins show homology to ClpP-type serine proteases (7Green J.B. Fricke B. Chetty M.C. von Du ̈ring M. Preston G.F. Stewart G.W. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One member of the stomatin superfamily, prohibitin, reportedly possesses a regulatory function during membrane protein degradation by the AAA proteases of yeast mitochondria (9Langer T. Ka ̈ser M. Klanner C. Leonhard K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two other members, HflK and HflC in E. coli, are proposed to have a similar function in association with the bacterial membrane-bound AAA protease FtsH (10Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, stomatin is presumed to be some kind of partner for membrane-bound proteases. But no experimental data about the p-stomatin partner nfed has been reported. In the sequences of P. horikoshii, PH1510 and PH1511 correspond to nfed and p-stomatin, respectively. Therefore, it is speculated that PH1510 would be a protease and function in cooperation with the stomatin homolog PH1511. In this study, we characterize the N-terminal region of PH1510 as a protease with novel substrate specificity and discuss its relationship with the stomatin-like protein PH1511. Chemicals and Bacterial Strains—The vector pET-21b was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Ultracompetent E. coli XL2-Blue MRF′ cells and E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL competent cells were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). KOD-Plus polymerase was purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Restriction enzymes and a ligation kit were obtained from Takara Shuzo (Shiga, Japan) and used according to the manufacturer's directions. A protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Construction of Expression Vectors—Using genomic DNA of P. horikoshii OT3 as a template (11Higashibata H. Kikuchi H. Kawarabayasi Y. Matsui I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15983-15990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the DNA fragments encoding residues shown in Fig. 1 were amplified by PCR with two primers containing NdeI and XhoI sites. The amplified fragments were digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into an expression vector, pET-21b, between the NdeI and XhoI sites. Ultracompetent E. coli XL2-Blue MRF′ cells were transformed with the ligated products. After the transformant colonies were propagated in 5 ml of 2× yeast tryptone medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), the resultant plasmids were purified using a Qiagen plasmid mini kit. The DNA sequences were verified using an ABI PRISM kit and a model 310 capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The site-directed alanine mutants of 1510-N (residues 16–236 of PH1510) were prepared similarly, except that the overlap PCR method was used (12Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Wondisford F.E. Taylor S.I. Gene. 1989; 76: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All of the resultant proteins had hexahistidine tags at their C termini. Expression and Purification of the Proteins—For the preparation of PH1510 N-terminal constructs shown in Fig. 1 and several alanine mutants of PH1510 (residues 16–236), E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells were transformed with the plasmids. The transformed cells were grown in 2× yeast tryptone medium containing ampicillin at 30 °C and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Nacalai Tesque) at 30 °C overnight. The induced cells were centrifuged and stored at –20 °C. The frozen cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1.5% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM; Anatrace, Maumee, OH), the protease inhibitor, and DNase I (Sigma) and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g to remove cell debris, the supernatant was heated at 85 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 15 min to remove denatured proteins. The supernatant was loaded on a nickel affinity column (Novagen) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) containing 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% DDM, and 5 mm imidazole. After a wash with the buffer containing 30 mm imidazole, the proteins were eluted with the elution buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The purified samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE performed on a 10–15% gradient gel using the Phast system (Amersham Biosciences). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Nacalai Tesque). The collected protein samples were concentrated using Centriprep-10 or Centricon-10 (Millipore). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). For an approximate estimation of molecular weights of the protein samples, the purified proteins were loaded on a Superose 12 (10/30) column (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.1% DDM using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). For the preparation of the 1510-C (residues 371–441 of PH1510), 1511-N (residues 69–234 of PH1511), and 1511-C (residues 189–266 of PH1511) shown in Fig. 1, the transformed cells were grown in 2× yeast tryptone medium containing ampicillin at 37 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. The purification was performed similarly, except that DDM was not used. For the further purification of 1511-N and 1511-C, the proteins were loaded on an anion-exchange Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Activity Staining—For detection of the protease activity of 1510-N, casein-copolymerized SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (13Blumentals I.I. Robinson A.S. Kelly R.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but with a slight modification. The protein sample was kept at room temperature for 1 h in the presence of 0.8% sodium lauroylsarcosine (Nacalai Tesque), 10% glycerol, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS and 0.2% casein (Difco). After electrophoresis, the gel with duplicated runs of the left and right sides was cut in half, and one-half was washed for 1 h in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated at 80 °C for 16 h in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) for a proteolytic reaction. The gel was then cooled and stained with 0.1% Amido Black containing 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Proteolytic activity was visualized as clear zones resulting from casein hydrolysis. The other half of the gel was stained with conventional Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for confirmation of the protein band. Quantification of Proteolytic Activity—Proteolytic activity was measured by the hydrolysis of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled bovine casein (Sigma). The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) consists of FITC-casein and enzyme in 20 mm sodium MES (pH 6) and was incubated at 80 °C for several minutes. To stop the reaction, the mixture was kept on ice and added with a sample buffer containing a final concentration of 0.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The mixture (28 μl) was heated at 98 °C for 5 min, and 14 μl of the sample was electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. The reaction products on the gel were visualized and quantified using a FluorImager 585 (Amersham Biosciences) with excitation and emission filters of 488 and 530 nm, respectively. The protease activity was calculated with the formula R = P/(S + P), in which S is the value of the non-degraded casein band and P is the value of all the degraded products located below the original casein band. The protease activity was normalized with the following formula: (percentage of cleavage) = 100 × (RX – R0)/(1 – R0), in which RX is the R-value at X min. The initial velocities were obtained directly from the initial slopes of the percentage of cleavage values along with the time course plots. To identify the type of protease inhibitor influencing the proteolytic activity of 1510-N, the protease inhibitors iodoacetic acid, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin were purchased from Sigma, along with EDTA from Dojin Laboratories. After an incubation with each protease inhibitor at 37 °C for 20–60 min, the protease activity of 1510-N was measured. Identification of the Proteolytic Product—Using α- and β-caseins (both bovine; Sigma) and the purified proteins 1510-C, 1511-N, and 1511-C as substrates, a proteolytic reaction with 1510-N was performed, and the reaction mixture was electrophoresed. After the electrophoresis, degraded protein bands were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of degraded products were determined by the APRO Life Science Institute, Inc. or the Hokkaido System Science Co. Hydropathy Plots and Sequence Comparison—PH1510 and PH1511 are putative membrane proteins predicted by SOSUI (14Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) with five and two membrane-spanning regions, respectively (Fig. 1). In the peptidase data base MEROPS (15Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), PH1510 is classified into Clan SK according to its protein sequence. E. coli ClpP (2Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 565-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) also belongs to this group of serine proteases. Comparison of the N-terminal region of PH1510 and its homologs (Fig. 2) revealed conserved serine and lysine residues. Green et al. proposed that the nfed gene product like PH1510 could conform to Clan SF of the serine proteases, in which the catalytic site is formed by a conserved Ser-Lys dyad (7Green J.B. Fricke B. Chetty M.C. von Du ̈ring M. Preston G.F. Stewart G.W. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, no experimental data has been reported about PH1510 homologs. The PH1510 gene is immediately upstream of PH1511 with a four-base overlap, ATGA. In 19 organisms of eubacteria and archaea, which include P. horikoshii, the nfed gene is located adjacent to the p-stomatin gene. Judging from the conserved gene cluster, these genes probably form an operon (7Green J.B. Fricke B. Chetty M.C. von Du ̈ring M. Preston G.F. Stewart G.W. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purification of N-terminal Fragment of PH1510—Attempts were initially made to express the intact PH1510 in E. coli, but in vain. It is difficult to stably express an intact protein because of a large number of membrane-spanning regions. Then, the N-terminal soluble regions of PH1510 (Fig. 1) were expressed in E. coli. The protein spanning residues 16–236 (1510-N) was successfully expressed and purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE shows a major band of 1510-N at ∼25 kDa corresponding to the predicted mass (Fig. 3A). The constructs other than residues 16–236 of PH1510 were not fully expressed, although some expression of residues 16–197 was observed. This result indicates that the N-terminal sequences in particular would be important for protein expression. To keep the 1510-N with partly hydrophobic regions in its N terminus stable, the protein was kept in the presence of DDM throughout the purification steps, although DDM is not essential for protease activity, as indicated later. About 1 mg of the purified protein could be produced from a liter of culture. The approximate molecular mass of 1510-N was measured using gel filtration. The expected value was ∼40–50 kDa (data not shown). Thus, 1510-N would possibly form a dimer. Site-directed alanine mutants of 1510-N were prepared in the same way as the wild-type, with a similar yield (Fig. 3B). For further experiments, 1510-C, 1511-N, and 1511-C were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In SDS-PAGE analyses, purified 1510-C, 1511-N, and 1511-C showed major bands at around 10 kDa, 19 kDa, and 10 kDa, corresponding to the predicted mass (Fig. 3A). Detection of Protease Activity—Using the purified 1510-N, protease activity was detected with staining (Fig. 4). The protein sample was mildly denatured with sodium lauroylsarcosine instead of SDS and not heated; it was then electrophoresed on a casein-copolymerized polyacrylamide gel. After incubation at 80 °C for 16 h, the gel was stained with Amido Black. As a result of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining, a major protein band at ∼45 kDa was observed (Fig. 4). The corresponding band was cleared from the background by casein hydrolysis. The result indicates that 1510-N shows protease activity. The gel filtration analysis indicated that 1510-N possibly forms a dimer. Further analyses are needed to make clear whether 1510-N functions in a dimeric form. Measurement of Protease Activity Using FITC-casein—To quantify the protease activity, FITC-casein and 1510-N were mixed and incubated at 80 °C for several minutes. The reaction mixture separated with SDS-PAGE was visualized using a FluorImager (Fig. 5A). The FITC-casein consists of FITC-α-casein (appeared ∼30 kDa) and FITC-β-casein (∼23 kDa). The α- and β-caseins are phosphorylated (16Fiat A.M. Jolle ̀s P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 87: 5-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and their differences in phosphorylation probably contribute to the different rates of migration on SDS-PAGE despite their similar molecular masses. As the reaction proceeded, the 20-kDa degraded band, some minor bands, and the FITC-peptides located at the bottom of the gel increased. Assuming that the substrate shows the total fluorescence intensity of the bands of FITC-α- and β-caseins and that the product shows the total intensity of the bands below the substrate, the protease activity was measured and the normalized activity was calculated as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” β-Casein is not cleaved as effectively as α-casein, as indicated later. Thus, the cleavage of α-casein is mainly measured in the analysis. The proteolytic activity is shown as the percentage of cleavage versus time (Fig. 5B). Proteolytic activity was measured as described above in several buffer solutions at various pH values. The optimal pH was ∼5–6 (Fig. 6A). The temperature dependence was measured similarly, and elevated activity was observed with temperatures from 50 to 98 °C (Fig. 6B). This observation indicates that 1510-N is a hyperthermostable protease. As the salt concentration increases, the activity decreases; the level of activity in 0.1 m NaCl was about one-tenth of that in 0 m NaCl (data not shown). Divalent cations generally have inhibitory effects on the activity: MgCl2, 14% residual activity; MnCl2, 4% activity; CaCl2, 11% activity; and ZnCl2, 9% activity (in 10 and 20 mm sodium MES buffer (pH 6) in comparison with the control lacking a divalent cation in the MES buffer). Detergents also inhibit the activity: 0.1% DDM, 38% activity; 0.01% SDS, 53% activity; and 1% SDS, 1.2% activity (in comparison with the control). Detection of Catalytic Residues—Using the 1510-N mutants (Fig. 3B), the protease activity was measured with FITC-casein. For each mutant and wild-type sample, the percentage of cleavage with time as shown in Fig. 7A is plotted for four different enzyme quantities, and an average value of percentage of cleavage versus time to the amount of the enzyme (percentage/min/μg) relative to the wild-type is indicated with the S.D. (Fig. 7B). S97A shows 0.08% activity compared with the wild-type. The 0.08% activity is not significantly above background. Thus, Ser-97 is considered to be a catalytic residue. T62A, K138A, and D168A have relatively low levels of activity of 5.5, 1.2, and 3.2%, respectively. From activity staining, D168A shows a 25-kDa band instead of 45-kDa band (data not shown). Although Asp-168 may be involved in proteolysis, a different oligomeric form of D168A possibly contributes to the weaker activity. Other mutants show levels of activity relatively similar to that of the wild-type protease. These results indicate that 1510-N is a serine protease with a catalytic residue, Ser-97. Using protease inhibitors, the protease activity of 1510-N was measured, and values relative to the control with no inhibitor were calculated. The relative activity was 83% in 5 mm iodoacetic acid (cysteine protease inhibitor), 33% in 5 mm EDTA (metalloprotease inhibitor), and 79% in 5 μm pepstatin (aspartic protease inhibitor), indicating that these inhibitors do not remarkably inhibit the protease activity of 1510-N. In the case of typical serine protease inhibitors, the relative activity was 79% in 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 51% in 1 mm 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin. These serine protease inhibitors do not remarkably affect the activity. Sequence Specificity of Cleavage—To elucidate the sequence specificity of the cleavage site, certain proteins were used as substrate for the 1510-N protease. Among the α- and β-caseins 1510-C, 1511-N, and 1511-C, relatively good substrates are α-casein and 1511-C. Specifically degraded products are shown in the SDS-PAGE pattern (Fig. 8). N-terminal sequences of the degraded products were determined (Table I). The α-13k (13 kDa) product is from αs1-casein, and the α-14k (14 kDa) product is mainly from αs2-casein (Table I). Considering that α-casein contains αs1- and αs2-caseins at a ratio of 6:1 (17Andrews A.T. Taylor M.D. Owen A.J. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 348: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the minor product, α-14k (14 kDa), is a relatively major one among αs2-casein-degraded products (Table I). The α-20k (20 kDa) product mainly shows the N terminus of αs1-casein on N-terminal sequencing and partly contains the minor product (∼10%) of αs1-casein (α-20k-2 in Table I). The 1511–10k (10 kDa) product is a major degraded product from 1511-C (Table I). β-casein was not degraded effectively, but minor 12k (12 kDa) products were produced (Table I). From other substrates like 1510-C and 1511-N, no cleaved products were observed. 1510-N probably cleaves the substrate specifically. The cleavage sites contain many hydrophobic and aromatic residues. Some features of sequence specificity are observed for the upper three major products in Table I. The site P1 (position –1 relative to the cleavage site) is leucine, whereas P4 is valine or leucine. P4′ (position +4 relative to the cleavage site) contains hydrophobic residues such as methionine or proline. On the other hand, the lower four minor products in Table I indicate that leucine is located at P2, P1′, or P2′. The 1510-N protease possibly recognizes leucine at the cleavage site.Table ICleavage site sequencesProduct nameP6P5P4P3P2P1P1′P2′P3′P4′P5′P6′1511-10k (90%)SNVIVLMLPMEMα-13k-1 (100%)YKVPQLEIVPNSα-14k-1 (70%)QYLQYLYQGPIVα-20k-2 (10%)PQEVLNENLLRFβ-12k-1 (40%)PGPIHNSLPQNIβ-12k-2 (40%)FAQTQSLVYPFPβ-12k-3 (10%)NIPPLTQTPVVV Open table in a new tab In this report, the N-terminal region of PH1510 was identified as a novel hyperthermostable serine protease. Following sequence alignment of the nfed homologs, relatively conserved aspartic acids were mutated and the protease activity of their alanine mutants was measured, but no suitable candidates for a catalytic residue were found (Fig. 7B). D168A shows relatively little activity as indicated, but Asp-168 is not highly conserved. His-107, the only histidine of 1510-N, is not a catalytic residue (Fig. 7B). Thus, 1510-N is not a typical serine protease with a catalytic triad of Ser, His, and Asp. Green et al. (7Green J.B. Fricke B. Chetty M.C. von Du ̈ring M. Preston G.F. Stewart G.W. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) pointed out the presence of conserved residues such as Lys and the TPGG motif. K138A and T62A show relatively low levels of activity, and Lys-138 and Thr-62 are perfectly conserved. 1510-N probably has a catalytic Ser-Lys dyad composed of conserved Ser-97 and Lys-138. Thr-62 also seems to be involved in proteolysis. Typical serine protease inhibitors such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin do not remarkably inhibit the activity of 1510-N. Inhibitors of cysteine protease, metalloprotease, and aspartic protease do not remarkably affect the activity either. These results support the possibility that 1510-N is a serine protease with a catalytic Ser-Lys dyad, because serine proteases with catalytic Ser-Lys often show little or no reactivity with typical serine protease inhibitors (18Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 28-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Bacterial leader peptidase 1 and the repressor LexA are known as serine proteases with a catalytic Ser-Lys dyad and belong to Clan SF (20Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Recently, tail-specific protease and C-terminal endoprotease, which have a catalytic Ser-Lys dyad (21Beebe K.D. Shin J. Peng J. Chaudhury C. Khera J. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Janse ̀n T. Kidron H. Soitamo A. Salminen T. Ma ̈enpa ̈a ̈ P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), were classified into Clan SK in the MEROP data base (15Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). According to the data base, 1510-N belongs to Clan SK. These results also support the 1510-N protease with a catalytic Ser-Lys dyad. Lys-138 might act as a general base to increase the nucleophilicity of the active site Ser-97 as indicated in the Ser-Lys dyad mechanism (19Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 28-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). According to a structural modeling study of CtpC protease, a threonine residue is hydrogen-bonded to the catalytic lysine, and the interaction might be important for activity (22Janse ̀n T. Kidron H. Soitamo A. Salminen T. Ma ̈enpa ̈a ̈ P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The Thr-62 of 1510-N might function similarly. Considering that the SDS-PAGE pattern of degraded products shows clear bands (Fig. 8), 1510-N is an endo-type protease. Also, it only cleaves specific proteins. Clearly, it specifically recognizes the substrate. The sequences around the cleavage sites are rich in hydrophobic residues, and substrates are mainly cleaved after leucine. Sites P4 and P4′ are mainly hydrophobic residues. No other definitive sequence specificity was found. The tail-specific protease, one of the Clan SK protease members, selectively degrades proteins bearing a nonpolar C terminus. In particular, a protein with the C-terminal sequence WVAAA is a good substrate for the protease (23Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2589-2593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The signal peptide peptidase A (SppA, also known as protease IV) belongs to Clan SK and is a typical membrane protein (24Bolhuis A. Matzen A. Hyyryla ̈inen H.L. Kontinen V.P. Meima R. Chapuis J. Venema G. Bron S. Freudl R. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24585-24592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Signal peptides and their cleavage sequences have been investigated extensively, and sites P1 and P3 are, for the most part, alanines in bacteria (25Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4934) Google Scholar). In the case of 1510-N, P1 is mainly leucine. It seems that 1510-N may have some features in common with SppA in other respects. 1510-N might possibly recognize secondary or tertiary structures, in particular specific structures of membrane-bound proteins. One of the substrates, 1511-10k (10 kDa) (Table I), has all hydrophobic residues from P4 to P4′. The cleavage site is between residues 238 and 239 of PH1511. The region from residue 235 to 242, corresponding to P4 to P4′, shows high hydrophobicity (PH1511 in Fig. 1) and thus is considered to be anchored to the membrane. The 1510-N protease possibly recognizes and cleaves specific proteins that are located at the membrane surface and are in a particular structure. An analysis with an operon-predicting algorithm (26Ermolaeva M.D. White O. Salzberg S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) indicated that PH1510 (nfed homolog) and PH1511 (stomatin homolog) likely form an operon. It is interesting that 1510-N cleaves 1511-C (Fig. 8B). From this result and the probability of forming an operon, PH1510 probably functions in cooperation with PH1511. The cleavage might play some important roles. Thus, a hypothesis is proposed as indicated in Fig. 9. In a sequence alignment of the C-terminal region of PH1511 and its homologs, including stomatin in humans and MEC-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 10), hydrophobic residues are assembled around the corresponding cleavage site of PH1511 by the 1510-N protease. According to SOSUI (14Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), stomatin in humans (288 amino acids) and MEC-2 in C. elegans (481 amino acids) have membrane-spanning segments at their N-terminals, and the residual C-terminal regions are soluble. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plots of the C-terminal regions for stomatin and MEC-2 show relatively high hydrophobicity in the underlined region in Fig. 10 (data not shown). Thus, the underlined region (Fig. 10) of stomatin and MEC-2 might be anchored to the membrane. In eukaryotes, nfed homologs are not found, but it seems possible that some kind of protease (for example AAA protease) might cleave the C-terminal membrane-anchored region of stomatin or MEC-2, and an ion channel might open. The hypothesis shown in Fig. 9 is consistent with the result that the epithelial sodium channel in Xenopus is activated by proteolysis (28Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D.

Direct evidence relating to the function of stomatin is not reported in this article, but a relationship between the epithelial sodium channel and the stomatin-like protein has been established (7Green J.B.

One member of the stomatin superfamily, prohibitin, is reported to have a role in the regulation of mitochondrial AAA proteases in yeast (9Langer T. Ka ̈ser M. Klanner C. Leonhard K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and this report shows a relationship between prohibitin and proteases. In bacteria and Archaea, on the other hand, stomatin and nfed homologs are found, but to our knowledge there are no reports about the relationship between p-stomatin and ion channels. However, stomatin homologs are present in almost all species of eukaryotes, bacteria, and Archaea. Assuming that stomatin homologs in eukaryotes and p-stomatins in prokaryotes have common features, it seems possible, as suggested in Fig. 9, that stomatin homologs have a common function in cooperation with proteases and ion channels in almost all species.Fig. 10Sequence alignment of C-terminal amino acids for PH1511 and its homologs. The figure is prepared similarly as in Fig. 2 with PH1511 (from P. horikoshii; NCBI accession number NP_143371), PAB1933 (P. abyssi; NP_126340), PA0452 (P. aeruginosa; NP_249143), SMB20989 (S. meliloti; NP_437654), MEC-2 (C. elegans; NP_741797), and stomatin (human; NP_004090).

The precursor PH1511 would become an active form with its C-terminal region degraded by the PH1510 protease and would then regulate an ion channel. On the other hand, it seems possible that PH1511 regulates the PH1510 protease activity as the stomatin-like protein regulates AAA protease (9Langer T. Ka ̈ser M. Klanner C. Leonhard K. Biochem. Soc.

Further study is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism behind the relationship among stomatins, ion channels, and proteases. Green et al. (7Green J.B. Fricke B. Chetty M.C. von Du ̈ring M. Preston G.F. Stewart G.W. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) pointed out further that the central membrane-spanning region of the nfed protein is partly homologous to a sterol-sensing domain found in some eukaryotic proteins. One of the sterol-sensing domains, the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), plays essential roles in regulating cholesterol homeostasis (30Kuwabara P.E. Labouesse M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Cholesterol acts as an effector molecule, and proteolysis is linked to the cholesterol concentration in eukaryotic cells. It seems possible that the central membrane-spanning region of PH1510 acts like a SCAP and that the protease activity of the N-terminal domain is regulated with a cholesterol-like molecule binding to the central region of PH1510. Some studies about membrane-based proteolysis by the SCAP/SREBP system have been reported (30Kuwabara P.E. Labouesse M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 31Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).

Here, we show that C4-2 cells, androgen-hypersensitive derivatives of LNCaP cells, also are sensitive to PMA-induced apoptosis. Previous reports have implicated activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes α and δ in PMA-induced LNCaP apoptosis using overexpression, pharmacological inhibitors, and dominant-negative constructs, but have left unresolved if other isozymes are involved, if there are separate requirements for individual PKC isozymes, or if there is redundancy. We have resolved these questions in C4-2 cells using stable expression of short hairpin RNAs to knock down expression of specific PKC isozymes individually and in pairs. Partial knockdown of PKCδ inhibited PMA-induced C4-2 cell death almost completely, whereas near-complete knockdown of PKCα had no effect. Knockdown of PKCϵ alone had no effect, but simultaneous knockdown of both PKCα and PKCϵ in C4-2 cells that continued to express normal levels of PKCδ inhibited PMA-induced apoptosis. Thus, our data indicate that there is an absolute requirement for PKCδ in PMA-induced C4-2 apoptosis but that the functions of PKCα and PKCϵ in apoptosis induction are redundant, such that either one (but not both) is required. Investigation of PMA-induced events required for LNCaP and C4-2 apoptosis revealed that p38 activation is dependent on PKCδ, whereas induction of retinoblastoma protein hypophosphorylation requires both PKC signaling pathways and is downstream of p38 activation in the PKCδ pathway.

First, LNCaP cells and fibroblasts from an osteosarcoma were co-injected into a male nude mouse, followed by castration and excision of a tumor 8 and 12 weeks later, respectively, and the C4 cell line was derived from in vitro culture of the tumor. Co-injection of C4 cells and osteosarcoma fibroblasts into a castrated mouse, removal of a tumor 12 weeks later, and culture of the tumor yielded the C4-2 line. C4-2 cells grow faster than LNCaP cells in culture and, in contrast to LNCaP cells, form moderately metastatic tumors in castrated mice when injected without any bone or other matrix (6Thalmann G.N. Anezinis P.E. Chang S.M. Zhau H.E. Kim E.E. Hopwood V.L. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2577-2581PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that C4-2 cells exhibit increased stabilization and nuclear localization of the androgen receptor relative to LNCaP cells and are hypersensitive to growth stimulation by androgens (7Gregory C.W. Johnson Jr., R.T. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2892-2898PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, C4-2 cells approximate the result of progression of most human prostate tumors after androgen withdrawal. Here, we report that C4-2 cells have retained sensitivity to PMA-induced apoptosis similar to LNCaP cells, and we have clarified the PKC isozyme signaling pathways controlling the process. PMA activates at least 26 proteins of seven classes in human cells by mimicking the endogenous activator diacylglycerol, including four classical (α, βI, βII, and γ) and four novel (δ, ϵ, η, and θ) PKC isozymes, three protein kinase D (PKD) isozymes (PKCμ (PKD), PKD2, and PKCν), five calcium- and diacylglycerol-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factors, four chimaerins, three Munc13 isozymes, two myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinases (MRCKs), and diacylglycerol kinase-γ (8Yang C.

Sequence-specific targeting of mRNAs by vector-directed expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) is a highly promising approach for stable inhibition of expression of specific proteins. We have used this approach to generate clones of C4-2 cells with PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ knocked down individually and in pairs and have used these clones to clarify the PKC isozyme requirements of PMA-induced C4-2 cell death. Our data show a requirement for PKCδ and a redundant pathway that can be effected by either PKCα or PKCϵ, a more complex combination of isozymes than recognized previously. PMA-induced apoptosis of LNCaP and C4-2 cells is preceded by activation of the three major families of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p38 (12Tanaka Y. Gavrielides M.V. Mitsuuchi Y.

Examination of some of these events during PMA treatment of our PKC knockdown clones revealed that p38 activation requires PKCδ, whereas Rb hypophosphorylation requires both PKCδ and either PKCα or PKCϵ. Furthermore, p38 activation is required for PMA-induced Rb hypophosphorylation, indicating that PKCδ acts through a separate signaling pathway than PKCα and PKCϵ to activate Rb. Our results show that PMA-induced apoptosis of C4-2 cells requires a more complex combination of PKC isozymes than recognized previously and that different PKC signaling pathways control different events required for apoptosis. shRNA Expression Constructs—The shRNA expression vector pSHAG-1 (17Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), a derivative of pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) containing a human U6 small nuclear RNA promoter upstream of BseRI and BamHI cloning sites, was a gift from Dr. G. J. Hannon (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). For selection of stably transfected clones, we inserted a neomycin or blasticidin resistance cassette under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and polyadenylation signals into the EcoRV site of pSHAG-1 to yield pSHAG-1neo and pSHAG-1bla. Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides encoding shRNAs targeting human PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ were designed using the online program shRNA Retriever, developed by R. Sachidanandam and J. Faith (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY), and following suggestions of the Tuschl laboratory (29Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). All had the following structure: mRNA target = N1–27C28; oligonucleotide A = (reverse complement of N1–27)-GAAGCTTGN1–27C28, with every third A or C of the sense N1–27 converted to G or T, respectively, up to a maximum of four base changes; and oligonucleotide B = exact reverse complement of the entire oligonucleotide A, bounded by GATC (BamHI overhang) at its 5′-end and CG (BseRI overhang) at its 3′-end. Each target sequence was compared with all other sequences in the Celera Human Genome Database, and any with >10 continuous matching nucleotides or fewer than four mismatches relative to any mRNA sequence in the data base were rejected. Negative control shRNAs with 4 mismatched bases relative to the target were designed for PKCα and PKCδ and rechecked for homologies to other sequences in the Celera Database. 5′-Phosphorylated polyacrylamide gel-purified oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Equimolar amounts of oligonucleotides A and B were annealed and ligated to BseRI-BamHI-double-digested calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated and agarose gel-purified pSHAG-1neo or pSHAG-1bla. Ligation mixtures were transformed into TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen), and plasmid DNA was isolated with a Wizard Plus SV miniprep kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Inserts were checked by restriction digestion and sequenced at the Utah State University Biotechnology Center. To increase knockdown efficacy in stably transfected clones, two shRNA expression cassettes targeting different regions of the same mRNA were inserted into one pSHAG vector. This was done by excising the U6 shRNA promoter expression cassette as a NotI-AscI fragment from one shRNA expression construct, filling in the overhangs with Klenow fragment, and inserting it into the HpaI site of another shRNA expression construct (Fig. 1). Only constructs with both expression cassettes in the same orientation were used. In each PKC mRNA, the two target sequences chosen for the shRNA expression constructs used for selection of stable clones were as follows: PKCα target 1, 5′-TGATTCAGGATGATGACGTGGAGTGCAC; PKCα target 2, 5′-TGATTCAGGATGATGACGTGGAGTGCAC; PKCδ target 1, 5′-CATCAAGAACCATGAGTTTATCGCCACC; PKCδ target 2, 5′-ATGCATCGACAAGATCATCGGCAGATGC; PKCϵ target 1, 5′-CCTACATTGCCCTCAATGTGGACGACTC; and PKCϵ target 2, 5′-CACTTCGAGGACTGGATTGATCTGGAGC. For overexpression of wild-type PKCϵ, a cDNA containing the complete coding sequence of human PKCϵ was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and subcloned into the expression vector pIREShyg. A point mutation at nucleotide 102 of the coding region of that cDNA was reverted to the wild type G, using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture and Transfections—LNCaP and C4-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and UroCor Labs (Oklahoma City, OK), respectively. Cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine (complete RPMI 1640 medium) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. shRNA expression constructs were transfected into C4-2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 18 h; the medium was replaced with fresh complete RPMI 1640 medium; and 12–18 h later, cells were replated in 100-mm dishes. 24–36 h after replating, selection was initiated by adding 500 μg/ml Geneticin or 10 μg/ml blasticidin. After ∼2 weeks of selection, individual colonies were isolated and expanded; PKC isozyme levels were determined by immunoblot analyses; and aliquots of selected clones were promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Human wild-type PKCϵ in pIREShyg or the pIREShyg vector alone was transfected into C4-2 clone α+ϵ1, with PKCα and PKCϵ knocked down. Selection of these transfectants in increasing concentrations of hygromycin (100–600 units/ml) yielded pools of cells used in the experiments of Fig. 6. In all cases, cells subjected to multiple transfections and drug selections were kept in culture for the minimal time to obtain stable clones for analysis and were otherwise kept frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunoblot Analyses—All cell lysis buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mm), activated sodium orthovanadate (0.2 mm), and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (10 mm). For immunoblotting of PKC isozymes, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and phosphorylated and total c-Jun and Rb, total cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (18Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Harford J.B. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002Google Scholar). For analyses of MAPKs, cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, and inhibitors) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were analyzed. Cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were prepared by Dounce homogenizing cells in buffer without detergent (10Powell C.T. Brittis N.J. Stec D. Hug H. Heston W.D. Fair W.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar), pelleting nuclei and unbroken cells by centrifugation at 800 × g, and then centrifuging post-nuclear supernatants at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants (cytoplasm) were recovered, and the pellets were Dounce-homogenized in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min to separate non-nuclear membranes (supernatants) from Triton-insoluble particles (pellets). Samples in NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and antioxidant (Invitrogen) were electrophoresed on precast SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (Bio-Rad) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblot analyses were performed using rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit Ig or sheep anti-mouse Ig secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) with enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies for PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An antibody that detects the native 115-kDa and 85-kDa cleavage products of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies for phospho-Ser807/811 Rb and total Rb; phospho-Ser63 c-Jun and total c-Jun; dual phosphorylated (Thr/Tyr) p38, JNKs, and ERKs; and total ERK1, ERK2, p38 isozymes, and JNK1–3 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell Viability Assay—Viable cells were quantified by incubating the cells with the tetrazolium compound 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) (Promega) and measuring the absorbance of the resulting formazan compound. Cells were plated in flat-bottom 96-well tissue culture plates (8 wells/condition), and PMA (10 nm) or ethanol vehicle (final concentration of 0.006%) was added 24 h later. At the indicated times after drug addition, 0.2 volume of MTS was added; the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h; and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a Molecular Devices UVmax kinetic microplate reader. Standard curves were constructed by counting viable LNCaP and C4-2 cells by trypan blue exclusion, assaying different numbers of viable cells with MTS, and plotting A490versus cell number. Cell Death Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Quantification of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis was performed with a cell death detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied Science). Cells (2 × 104/well) were plated in 96-well plates with complete RPMI 1640 medium, and PMA (10 nm) or Me2SO vehicle (0.006%) was added 24 h later. After 24 h of drug treatment, plates were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min at room temperature to pellet detached cells. The medium was removed; cells were lysed; and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enrichment of histone-associated mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm was calculated as the absorbance at 405 nm of PMA-treated cells divided by the absorbance of vehicle-treated cells. Other Reagents—PMA was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). The p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 were purchased from Calbiochem; the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 was from Promega. Induction of C4-2 Cell Death by PMA—Continuous treatment of C4-2 cells with several concentrations of PMA yielded substantial reductions in viability at doses of 1–100 nm PMA, with maximal death induction by 10 nm (Fig. 2A), similar to the optimal dose in LNCaP cells (1Day M.L. Zhao X. Wu S. Swanson P.E. Humphrey P.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar, 19Young C.Y.F. Murtha P.E. Zhang J. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6 (C. Y. F.): 203-210PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of LNCaP and C4-2 cells revealed a similar time course of PMA induction of death in both cell lines (Fig. 2B). When numbers of PMA-treated cells were expressed as a percentage of vehicle-treated cells 72 h after addition of PMA, C4-2 cells (3.7%) were about as sensitive to 10 nm PMA as LNCaP cells (3.5%). We determined the effects on cell death of limiting the time of incubation of C4-2 cells with 10 nm PMA by removing the culture medium containing PMA at different times after its addition and replacing the medium with fresh medium without PMA. Fig. 2C shows that maximal induction of cell death by PMA required at least some signaling (either by PMA or by one or more factors released into the medium in response to PMA) that was prolonged for several hours. Stable shRNA-directed Knockdown of PKC Isozymes—We determined that C4-2 cells express the same subset of PMA-activated proteins as LNCaP cells. As shown by RNase protection and immunoblot analyses, C4-2 cells express PMA-activated PKCα, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCη, but not PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCγ, or PKCθ. LNCaP and C4-2 cells also express mRNAs for the three known PKD isozymes: PKD/PKCμ, PKCν, and PKD2. Regarding other PMA-activated proteins, both cell lines express Munc13-2 and MRCKβ, but not Munc13-1, Munc13-3, or MRCKα. We also detected very low amounts of calcium- and diacylglycerol-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factor-II by RNase protection, but were unable to detect this protein with available antibodies (data not shown). Because previous data implicated PKCα and PKCδ in PMA-induced LNCaP apoptosis, we initially targeted these isozymes for shRNA-directed knockdown in C4-2 cells. We also targeted PKCϵ because we found that overexpression of PKCϵ in LNCaP cells changed the effect of bryostatin-1 from inhibition of PMA-induced apoptosis to induction of apoptosis, 3C. T. Powell and L. Yin, manuscript in preparation. similar to our observations on PKCα-overexpressing LNCaP cells (3Gschwend J.E. Fair W.R. Powell C.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1224-1234PubMed Google Scholar). Several oligodeoxynucleotide pairs encoding shRNAs targeting multiple sequences within each mRNA were designed and tested by transient transfections of plasmid DNAs into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells express similar levels of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ compared with C4-2 cells and can be transfected routinely with >97% efficiency. Knockdown of PKCα was not observed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells until several days after transfection and usually required two sequential transfections of the cells, 5 days apart. The two most potent shRNAs targeting PKCα were expressed from the same pSHAG-1neo vector and yielded greater knockdown of PKCα than either one alone as assessed by competitive reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). The construct for expressing these two shRNAs was transfected into C4-2 cells. Because sequential transfections yielded significant toxicity and because transfection efficiency is usually low in C4-2 cells, stably transfected clones were selected. The same strategy was used to generate C4-2 clones stably transfected with pSHAG-1bla encoding two shRNAs targeting PKCδ or PKCϵ. The levels of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ in the knockdown clones are shown in Fig. 3A. PKCα was knocked down to barely detectable levels (clones α1 and α2), whereas knockdowns of PKCδ and PKCϵ were less complete, but >60% (clones δ1, δ2, ϵ1, and ϵ2). Because we had observed previously that PMA induces higher expression of PKCα, but not of PKCδ or PKCϵ, in LNCaP cells (10Powell C.T. Brittis N.J. Stec D. Hug H. Heston W.D. Fair W.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar), we also measured PMA-induced membrane translocation of PKCα in α1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, minimal PKCα was translocated to non-nuclear membranes by PMA in α1 cells relative to parental C4-2 cells. PKCα knockdown clone α1 was subsequently transfected with the PKCδ or PKCϵ shRNA expression constructs and selected with blasticidin to yield clones with PKCα and PKCδ knocked down (clone α1+δ) or with PKCα and PKCϵ knocked down (clones α+ϵ1 and α+ϵ2) (Fig. 3A). Also, clone δ2 was subsequently transfected with the PKCα shRNA expression construct and selected with Geneticin to yield clone δ2+α, with PKCα and PKCδ knocked down (Fig. 3A). Recent reports have shown that even 21-nucleotide double-stranded RNAs can activate the interferon system and the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR in certain cells, including up-regulation of numerous interferon-stimulated genes and activation of Jak-Stat signaling (20Bridge A.J. Pebernard S. Ducraux A. Nicoulaz A.L. Iggo R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 21Sledz C.A. Holko M. de Veer M.J. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5 (B. R. G.): 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Thus, it was important to determine whether expression in C4-2 cells of our shRNAs targeting PKCs induced an interferon response. The parental LNCaP cell line, from which C4-2 cells were derived, has been reported to be insensitive to interferon-mediated Stat activation and growth inhibition (22Kominsky S.L. Hobeika A.C. Lake F.A. Torres B.A. Johnson H.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3904-3908PubMed Google Scholar, 23Horoszewics J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, we found that stable expression of PKC shRNAs in C4-2 cells did not yield increased expression of p56, the most abundant protein induced by interferon in human cells, as assessed by immunoblot analyses. Also, microarray analyses conducted in the laboratory of Dr. B. R. G. Williams (Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) revealed no substantial changes in expression of 850 putative interferon-stimulated genes in our PKC shRNA-expressing clones relative to untransfected C4-2 cells (data not shown). Effects of PKC Isozyme Knockdowns on PMA-induced C4-2 Cell Death—All of the knockdown clones grew in complete RPMI 1640 medium at similar rates compared with untransfected C4-2 cells (data not shown). PMA-induced C4-2 cell death was unaffected by near-complete knockdown of PKCα alone (Fig. 4A), but was inhibited markedly by partial knockdown of PKCδ (Fig. 4B). Subsequent partial knockdown of PKCδ in a clone with PKCα depleted (clone α1+δ) yielded substantial inhibition of PMA-induced death (Fig. 4A), whereas subsequent knockdown of PKCα in a clone with PKCδ knocked down (clone δ2+α) did not yield additional resistance to PMA (Fig. 4B). Knockdown of PKCϵ alone had no effect on PMA-induced C4-2 cell death (Fig. 4C), but subsequent knockdown of PKCϵ in a clone with PKCα knocked down (clone α+ϵ1o"

We find that axin2 expression is regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. The gene allows transcription of mRNAs with three alternative 5′-untranslated regions, and these are differentially expressed in various human cell types. These untranslated regions can differentially determine protein expression from messages by influencing mRNA stability and translational efficiency. We identify short upstream reading frames and structural motifs that are responsible for modulation of mRNA translational efficiencies. We show that the proportions of axin2 message expressing each 5′-untranslated region influence the amount of Axin2 protein expressed within cells. We discuss this complex regulation in the context of the function of Axin2 as a tumor suppressor.

Control of gene expression by elements within untranslated regions (UTRs) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; E0, exon 0; EST, expressed sequence tag; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; (u)ORF, (upstream) open reading frame. of mRNAs is a relatively little-studied regulatory mechanism despite recent evidence of its importance in both development (1de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 203: 567-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kuersten S. Goodwin E.B. Nat. Rev.

Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). UTRs can influence the amount of protein produced from messages by altering message stability, localization, or translational efficiency (5Pesole G. Mignone F. Gissi C. Grillo G. Licciulli F. Liuni S. Gene. 2001; 276: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Within 5′-UTRs, the presence of stable secondary structures, binding sites for trans-acting factors or short open reading frames (ORFs) upstream of the main coding sequence can have a strong influence on cap-dependent translation (6Meijer H.A. Thomas A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Some of these elements are fairly common, for example over 10% of human 5′-UTRs contain upstream ORFs (5Pesole G. Mignone F. Gissi C. Grillo G. Licciulli F. Liuni S. Gene. 2001; 276: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 6Meijer H.A. Thomas A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Despite this, published studies that reveal regulation of human gene expression by these elements, as opposed to continuous activation or repression, remain rare. Here, we have studied the regulation of human axin2. Axin2 is a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (7Kikuchi A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Liu W. Dong X. Mai M. Seelan R.S. Taniguchi K. Krishnadath K.K. Halling K.C. Cunningham J.M. Boardman L.A.

Cell Res. 2005; 303: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and acts as a tumor suppressor by limiting the deregulation of Wnt signaling that is common in some cancers (8Liu W. Dong X. Mai M. Seelan R.S. Taniguchi K. Krishnadath K.K. Halling K.C. Cunningham J.M. Boardman L.A. Qian C. Christensen E. Schmidt S.S. Roche P.C. Smith D.I. Thibodeau S.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 146-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Axin2 can be up-regulated by E2F1 allowing cross-talk between the pRb/E2F and Wnt/β-catenin pathways (9Hughes T.A. Brady H.J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); two pathways that have critical roles in the development of many cancers (10Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 11Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Axin2 also has a crucial role in segmentation of the vertebrate embryo (12Aulehla A. Wehrle C. Brand-Saberi B. Kemler R. Gossler A. Kanzler B. Herrmann B.G. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and may regulate neuronal cell differentiation (13Zechner D. Fujita Y. Hulsken J. Muller T. Walther I. Taketo M.M. Crenshaw 3rd, E.B. Birchmeier W. Birchmeier C. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We have identified three previously unknown exons at the start of the human axin2 gene and show that these code for alternative 5′-UTRs for the axin2 message. These UTRs are expressed differentially in various cell types and, crucially, each can modulate gene expression to a different degree by influencing both message stability and translational efficiency. Therefore, expression of Axin2 protein depends not only on the total amount of axin2 mRNA but also on what proportions of the three different 5′-UTRs are present. Moreover, the effects of these UTRs on protein expression can be adapted by other cellular factors and consequently expression of axin2 is further modulated by the cellular context. This intricate regulation of expression may represent a level of control that is applicable to many other genes. Cell Culture and Transfection—MCF7 and HEK-293T cells were obtained from ATCC (LGC Promochem, UK) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at ∼6 × 103 to 2 × 105 cells/cm2 and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (MCF7 cells, 0.75 μl/cm2) or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) (293T cells, 0.5 μl/cm2). Plasmid DNA (up to 1 μg/cm2) and transfection reagent were added to equal volumes of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) separately (5 min), before being combined (20 min, forming 1/5 of the total medium volume). The mix was added in single drops to cells in either normal medium (MCF7) or Opti-MEM I (293T). Medium was replaced after 5 h with either fresh normal medium (MCF7) or medium containing 20% serum (293T). Transfection efficiencies were between 30 and 60% as determined by expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from pTH-GFPa. Flow Cytometry—Cells were removed from culture plastic with trypsin/EDTA (Sigma) and re-suspended in medium containing phosphate-buffered saline. GFP expression was analyzed (104 events) at 525 nm on an Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Debris and dead cells were excluded (on the basis of forward activated light scatter versus side scatter), and gates were set so that the proportion of untransfected cells defined as expressing GFP was <1%. Plasmids—Plasmids pTH-GFPa and pGL3-Renilla have been described previously (9Hughes T.A. Brady H.J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Vectors to express the UTRs were created by cloning UTRs upstream of the coding sequence for GFP in pTH-GFPa. UTRs were amplified from MCF7 or 293T cell cDNA by PCR adding 5′ SacI and transcriptional start site and 3′ XhoI (primers: the initial sequence is common to all three forward primers, AGCAGAGCTCTCTGGCTAACTAGAGAACCCA, and then for UTRa, ACAGCCCGAGAGCCGGG; for UTRb and GFP+60, TCCCCGACGCCGCGGCC; for UTRc, CGGGGCCCCCGTGTCCC; for UTRbΔ60, GCCGGGGCCGGGCCCCTGCCAGGG; reverse primer, AGCACTCGAGGAGGGAGCTCTTCCCACTGAGTCTGGG; reverse primer for GFP+60, TAAACGCTAGCCCCCGGCTCGGCTCGCGG). UTRs were cloned into pTH-GFPa from which the transcriptional start and most of the multiple cloning site had been removed with SacI (partial)/XhoI. Start codons within GFP vectors were mutated using QuikChange II XL (Stratagene) and pairs of complementary primers of the following sequences (also adding restriction enzyme sites, + strand only shown), UTRa m1, CCCCTCAGAGCCGCGGATTTCGGGGC; UTRb m1, GCGCGCGGGGATCCTTGAGAGGAGG; UTRc m1, GGGGCTCGGAGGACTTGAGAGCCTGGCTTCG; UTR m2, GAGGAGGTTCAGAGGATCCCCTGCTGACTTGAGAG. cDNA Synthesis, Semi-quantitative PCR, and Real-time PCR—RNA was purified from cells using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Contaminating DNA was removed by digestion with DNase I (Roche Applied Science) if analyses of messages expressed from plasmids were to be carried out and RNA was further purified by phenol/chloroform extraction (×2) and ethanol precipitation using glycogen as a carrier. First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. A control lacking reverse transcriptase was also performed. cDNA from human tissues and cell lines were purchased from Clontech. RNA and protein that had been purified simultaneously from single tissue samples was purchased from BioChain (AMS Biotechnology). cDNA samples were subjected to semi-quantitative PCR using RedTaq (Sigma) and the following primer pairs: primers for UTRa (CCCTCAGAGCGATGGATTTCGG), UTRb (GGCTGCCGCCGCGAGCCGAGCC), and UTRc (TGCTTTCTGTGCTTTTTCTGCG) were paired with UTR-(GGAGGCAAGTCACCAACATAGC); axin2 reading frame, GCCTGCCCAAGGAGATGACCC or AATTCGCGGGAGGGGGC, and CTTCGTCGTCTGCTTGGTCAC; β-actin, AACCGACTGCTGTCACCTTCAC and GGCATCCACGAAACTACCTTCAAC; GFP, CACAAGTTCAGCGTGTCCG and CCCTCGAACTTCACCT; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT and CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC. Products were analyzed on 2.5% agarose with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide using 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm disodium EDTA) and visualized on a UV trans-illuminator. We established that the products shown were taken from reactions within the linear range of amplification by examining reactions after at least three different numbers of cycles. PCR reactions were performed at least twice. Duplicate PCR reactions were performed using templates lacking reverse transcriptase (except with Clontech panels), and products were not seen with these templates. Products were sequenced to ensure their specificity. Representative data are shown. Real-time PCR analysis was performed in triplicate using “assay on demand” reagents (Applied Biosystems: axin2, Hs00610344_m1; β-actin, Hs99999903_m1) on an ABI Prism 7000 machine. Luciferase Assays—Cells were transfected with expression vectors and pGL3-Renilla in triplicate wells and were assayed after 20 h using “stop and glow” reagent from the dual luciferase kit (Promega). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and removed from the substrate in 2× Laemmli buffer. DNA was sheared by sonication and samples were boiled (5 min). Proteins were separated on SDS 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked and stained with antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% milk, 0.2% Tween 20, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20. Antibodies: rat anti-tubulin (Serotec) 1:2000; rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science, clone 3F10) 1:1500; mouse anti-Axin2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-25302) 1:250; goat anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-1615) 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies 1:1000. horseradish peroxidase was visualized using ECL on ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using a Bio-Rad GS-800 densitometer and Quantity One software. Modeling of RNA Secondary Structure—Modeling was performed using mfold version 3.1 (available at bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/) under the following conditions: 37 °C, 1 m NaCl, no divalent ions, maximum interior bulge size of 30 nucleotides, and maximum asymmetry of bulge of 30 nucleotides. mRNAs for axin2 with Three Alternative 5′-UTRs Are Differentially Expressed in Human Cells—We have identified expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from GenBank™ that contain sequences from the 5′-end of the axin2 gene. Some of these contain the sequence of exon 1, whereas their 5′-ends contain one of three different sections of sequence located upstream of the known gene. Fig. 1A shows an alignment of the 5′-end of the human axin2 gene (located on chromosome 17q24) with these ESTs. The ESTs contain sequence from additional exons, which we have termed E0a, E0b, and E0c. These non-coding exons were not previously identified when the structure of the axin2 gene was determined (14Dong X. Seelan R.S. Qian C. Mai M. Liu W. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 93: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The ESTs contain alternative 5′-ends of the message, upstream of the reading frame, that we have termed UTRa, UTRb, and UTRc. We have investigated in which cell types these UTRs are expressed. Semi-quantitative PCR analysis was performed on cDNAs from human tissues and cell lines using forward primers specific for each UTR and a reverse primer for exon 1 (arrows, Fig. 1A). Products are only produced from templates that lack the intervening intron. Reactions were also performed using primers specific for sequence from the axin2 reading frame that is present in all axin2 messages, and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a housekeeping gene, to allow assessment of relative amounts of overall cDNA template (Fig. 1B). Message for axin2 is expressed most strongly in placenta, lung, and pancreas but is present in all tissues tested. All three UTRs are expressed widely, but there is clear differential expression between tissues. For example, UTRb and UTRc are most strongly expressed in placenta and lung, whereas UTRa is expressed most strongly in pancreas. Expression of UTRb is undetectable in liver as is expression of UTRc in smooth muscle (denoted by an asterisk). There is also differential expression of UTRs in the five cell lines that express axin2; for example, in SKO-V3 cells, expression of UTRc is undetectable, whereas UTRa and UTRb are expressed at levels similar to other lines. We were not able to identify species that contain sequence from more than one E0 exon, and we conclude that messages are spliced to express only UTRa, UTRb, or UTRc rather than in combinations. We conclude that the UTRs are widely expressed and that their levels relative to each other differ in various cell types. We also performed “rapid amplification of cDNA end” reactions from human placenta cDNA to identify the 5′-ends of the axin2 message (data not shown). We cloned species that represent all three of these alternative UTRs. The positions of the 5′-ends of some products were spread throughout exon 1 and the alternative E0s and we presume these to be from truncated messages. There was not a significant group of products with 5′-ends at or close to the start of exon 1, therefore we have no evidence that this site can act as a transcriptional start site as had been assumed (15Leung J.Y. Kolligs F.T. Wu R. Zhai Y. Kuick R. Hanash S. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21657-21665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It is clear that transcription does start upstream allowing expression of E0 exons. The sequence of the genomic region containing these exons is highly conserved between human, mouse, and rat (∼80% identical excluding insertions and deletions of more than three bases). This suggests that the sequences have regulatory functions and in accordance with this we have seen that the regions upstream of E0a, E0b, and E0c have substantial transcriptional promoter activity (data not shown). Different 5′-UTRs Define axin2 Message Stability—It is clear that there is differential expression of the three UTRs in human cells. We wished to establish whether UTR expression has consequences for the production of protein from mRNAs. For these studies we used MCF7 cells (a breast epithelial adenocarcinoma line), because axin2 regulation has previously been studied in this cell type (15Leung J.Y. Kolligs F.T. Wu R. Zhai Y. Kuick R. Hanash S. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21657-21665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and 293T cells, because these express axin2 mRNAs with each of the three UTRs (Fig. 1B). First, we examined whether the different 5′-UTRs afford axin2 messages different stabilities. Cells were treated with an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II to halt synthesis of mRNA. Under these conditions, mRNAs continue to be turned over and their relative stabilities can be assessed by measurement of rates at which they are degraded. Cells were treated with actinomycin D for up to 300 min, and cDNA was prepared at various times. Semi-quantitative PCR analysis was performed using primers for each UTR, for a sequence from the axin2 reading frame, and for β-actin (MCF7 cells, Fig. 2A; 293T cells, Fig. 2B). In MCF7 cells, we have been unable to detect messages containing UTRc reliably, indicating that this species is expressed at very low levels if at all (Fig. 2A, UTRc). Messages containing UTRa and UTRb were detected in MCF7 cells, and, as expected, all three species were detected in 293T cells. The assay was repeated using 293T cells, and products were quantified to allow calculation of average times for the amount of each species to decrease by 50%. Average decay times (±S.D.) for the three species are shown in Fig. 2B. In MCF7 cells, axin2 mRNAs containing UTRb were undetectable after only 60-min treatment with the inhibitor, indicating that they are relatively unstable, whereas those with UTRa remained after 300 min. In 293T cells, the quantification allows striking comparisons between stabilities. Messages for axin2 containing UTRc were dramatically less stable (47 min for 50% degradation) than those with either UTRa (102 min) or UTRb (155 min). These stabilities are reflected in the stability of total axin2 mRNA (89 min), which lies between the stability of those containing UTRc and those containing either UTRa or UTRb. We conclude that axin2 messages containing different 5′-UTRs have very different relative stabilities. We also conclude that these relative stabilities vary dramatically between cell types, because messages with UTRb are the most stable in 293T cells, whereas in MCF7 cells those containing UTRa are the most stable. We also determined the relative stabilities of luciferase messages with each of the three axin2 5′-UTRs in a similar assay (data not shown). We found that luciferase messages containing these UTRs were all much more stable than axin2 messages and differences in stability were negligible. We conclude that axin2 UTRs are not sufficient to specify stability of heterologous messages. Different 5′-UTRs Define Translational Efficiency of Messages—Next, we investigated whether axin2 UTRs directly influence the efficiency of translation of the subsequent ORF. Each UTR was cloned upstream of the GFP-reading frame in an expression vector. MCF7 and 293T cells were transfected with equal numbers of copies of either empty expression vector, vectors to express UTRa GFP, UTRb GFP, or UTRc GFP, or vector to express GFP with the 5′-UTR that is normally encoded by the vector as a control, and GFP expression was analyzed. First, we included an additional vector in these transfections to allow overexpression of an unrelated protein, Renilla luciferase. Cells were assayed for luciferase expression (Fig. 3A). The same amount of luciferase was expressed when included with each vector, and we conclude that these combinations of plasmids are transfected equally efficiently. Expression of GFP in transfected cells was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). In both cell types, there are clear and reproducible differences in GFP expression from these vectors. Because these transfected cells retain the ability to overexpress the same amount of another protein from equal amounts of vector (Fig. 3A), these differences in GFP expression are not caused by variation in transfection efficiencies or by effects on general protein synthesis. We examined GFP expression in more detail using flow cytometry. Fig. 4A shows representative histograms of intensity of GFP fluorescence for populations of transfected cells. To simplify the analysis we have quantified expression in two ways (Fig. 4B). First, we have set a threshold level of fluorescence that excludes >99% of cells transfected with only empty vector, and we measured proportions of the populations that exceed this level (upper panel). These gates and proportions of GFP positive cells are shown in Fig. 4A. Second, we measured mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of populations (lower panel). Each axin2 UTR causes a reduction in GFP expression (compare MFIs of each with control GFP vector). UTRb causes a further substantial reduction in GFP expression, which is detectable when expression is analyzed both by proportion of GFP positive cells and by MFI. UTRc allows expression at a level between that observed with UTRa and that observed with UTRb in MCF7 cells, whereas in 293T cells expression from UTRa and UTRc are similar. Semi-quantitative PCR analysis was performed on cDNA from cells that had been transfected with these vectors using primers specific for GFP, and for β-actin (Fig. 4C). In both cell types, the levels of GFP message are similar between populations transfected with each GFP vector. It is clear that differences in transcription from these vectors do not account for the differences in protein expression. We conclude that these UTRs specify the efficiencies with which the reading frame downstream is translated. Each UTR specifies a different efficiency and, because that determined by UTRc varies relative to the other UTRs in the two cell lines, it follows that the cellular context can modulate these effects. Upstream ORFs Reduce the Translational Efficiency of Messages Containing UTRa and UTRc—Each UTR contains two short ORFs upstream of the axin2 start codon (Fig. 5A). One is common to all three UTRs (lowercase), because it is wholly within the sequence of exon 1 (shaded gray), whereas the others are unique to each UTR (uppercase). These uORFs (‘u’ for upstream) can reduce the translational efficiency of a subsequent reading frame by stopping a proportion of scanning ribosomes from reaching the true start codon (6Meijer H.A. Thomas A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The start codons of uORFs are required for their inhibition of expression of downstream reading frames. To test whether uORFs have an effect in these UTRs, we mutated the start codons of each uORF in each UTR GFP expression vector and analyzed effects on GFP expression. Within each UTR, we mutated the start codon of either the first (unique to each UTR), the second (common to all), or both uORFs. These mutations are called “m1′,” “m2′,” and “both.” We compared expression from vectors containing these mutations with expression from the wild type UTR (wt) and from the GFP control vector as before (GFP). Cells were transfected with equal numbers of copies of the vectors and expression of GFP protein and mRNA was analyzed using flow cytometry (in this case only MFIs are shown, Fig. 5B) and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively (Fig. 5C). The levels of GFP message are similar between populations transfected with each GFP vector, thus differences in transcription from these vectors do not account for differences in GFP protein expression (Fig. 5C). Mutation of the start codon of the unique uORF within UTRa causes a substantial increase in GFP expression (Fig. 5B, compare gray bars, wt and m1). In 293T cells, this mutation (UTRa m1) allows expression at the high level also seen in the control GFP vector (GFP). Mutation of the unique uORF within UTRc (black bars, m1) has different effects in the two cell lines. In MCF7 cells this mutation causes a small but significant increase in GFP expression (Student's t test, p = 0.02), whereas in 293T cells there is no effect. Finally, mutation of the start codon of the unique uORF within UTRb (open bars, m1) has little effect in either line. Mutations in the start codons of the uORF that is common to all three UTRs have only slight effects on expression of GFP whether this is alone (compare wt with m2) or in combination with mutations in the unique uORFs (compare m1 and both). We conclude that uORFs repress translation of downstream reading frames in mRNAs containing some axin2 UTRs. The unique uORF within UTRa is responsible for the greater part, and in 293T cells perhaps all, of the repression of translation caused by UTRa. In UTRb, uORFs appear not to play a major role in repression of translation. Expression from UTRc is repressed by its unique uORF in MCF7 but not in 293T cells. These differences between the two cell lines underscore the fact that the cellular context can modulate the effects of the UTRs; thus these uORFs can be sites of regulation rather than continuous repression. UTRs of axin2 Form Stable Secondary Structures That Reduce the Translational Efficiency of Messages—Regions of RNA secondary structure within 5′-UTRs can inhibit translation of subsequent reading frames (16Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In some cases trans-acting factors bind these elements and regulate whether ribosomes continue to scan, whereas in others the RNA structure itself blocks ribosome passage (3Stoneley M. Willis A.E. Curr. Mol. Med. 2003; 3: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have examined whether axin2 UTRs are capable of forming significant secondary structure using computer modeling. The degree and stability of these structures can be quantified using the theoretical change in free energy (ΔG); structures that are more stable release more energy as they form and have greater ΔG values. UTRa, UTRb, and UTRc can form structures with ΔG values of -74, -112, and -219 kcal/mol, respectively. For comparison, the ΔG values of the 5′-UTRs of GFP message from the mammalian expression vector (as used in Figs. 3, 4, 5) and human β-actin are only -24 and -13 kcal/mol. UTRs of axin2 contain significant secondary structure that must contribute to their ability to repress translation. Modeling also revealed that the first 60 bases of UTRb can form an extremely stable stem-loop (ΔG, -40 kcal/mol) with 44 of its 60 nucleotides involved in base-pairing (Fig. 6A). The first 60 bases of UTRa and UTRc form structures with ΔG values of only -13 and -28 kcal/mol, respectively. Because uORFs appeared not to be responsible for inhibition of translation in UTRb (Fig. 5), we have tested whether these 60 bases, and thereby the structure they form, are responsible. MCF7 and 293T cells were transfected with equal numbers of copies of various vectors to express GFP. These vectors encode different 5′-UTRs: either UTRb as before (UTRb wt) or UTRb lacking the potentially inhibitory 60 bases (UTRb Δ60), or the 5′-UTR that is normally present in this vector (GFP wt) or that UTR plus these 60 bases near its 5′-end (GFP +60). Expression of GFP protein and mRNA was analyzed as previously. The levels of GFP message are similar between populations transfected with each vector, and differences in transcription do not account for differences in GFP expression (Fig. 6C). Deletion of the 60 bases from UTRb caused a significant de-repression of GFP expression (Fig. 6B, left panel), whereas addition of these 60 bases into the standard UTR of the expression vector caused a significant inhibition of expression (Fig. 6B, right panel). In both cases, the effects are considerably greater in 293T than in MCF7 cells. We conclude that the 60 base structural motif is responsible for a significant proportion of the translational repression of UTRb. Expression of Axin2 Protein Is Determined by the Relative Levels of axin2 UTRs—UTRs of axin2 had a profound differential effect on the translational efficiency of mRNAs (Fig. 3 and 4). We wished to examine whether this translational regulation modulates the expression of endogenous Axin2 protein. Human cell lines and tissues express different proportions of messages containing each axin2 UTR (Fig. 1B). Since these UTRs specify different translational efficiencies, we predicted that Axin2 protein expression would depend not only on the total amount of axin2 mRNA but also on the proportions of each 5′-UTR within these messages. For example, cells that express a large proportion of axin2 message containing UTRb would express relatively little Axin2 protein, because this UTR strongly represses translation. Initially, we examined MCF7 and 293T cells. We determined relative expression of axin2 at three levels: total mRNA, using real-time PCR (normalized to β-actin mRNA); 5′-UTRs, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR (as Fig. 1B); and protein, using Western blots. 293T cells express in excess of 3-fold more total axin2 mRNA than MCF7 cells (Fig. 7A). However, expression of axin2 messages containing UTRa is"
https://openalex.org/W1973791372,"Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are structurally related plasma membrane proteins known to mediate the Na+/K+-dependent uptake of the amino acids l-glutamate and dl-aspartate. In the nervous system, these proteins contribute to the clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft and maintain excitatory amino acid concentrations below excitotoxic levels. Two homologues exist in Drosophila melanogaster, dEAAT1 and dEAAT2, which are specifically expressed in the nervous tissue. We previously reported that dEAAT2 shows unique substrate discrimination as it mediates high affinity transport of aspartate but not glutamate. We now show that dEAAT2 can also transport the amino acid taurine with high affinity, a property that is not shared by two other transporters of the same family, Drosophila dEAAT1 and human hEAAT2. Taurine transport by dEAAT2 was efficiently blocked by an EAAT antagonist but not by inhibitors of the structurally unrelated mammalian taurine transporters. Taurine and aspartate are transported with similar Km and relative efficacy and behave as mutually competitive inhibitors. dEAAT2 can mediate either net uptake or the heteroexchange of its two substrates, both being dependent on the presence of Na+ ions in the external medium. Interestingly, heteroexchange only occurs in one preferred substrate orientation, i.e. with taurine transported inwards and aspartate outwards, suggesting a mechanism of transinhibition of aspartate uptake by intracellular taurine. Therefore, dEAAT2 is actually an aspartate/taurine transporter. Further studies of this protein are expected to shed light on the role of taurine as a candidate neuromodulator and cell survival factor in the Drosophila nervous system. Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are structurally related plasma membrane proteins known to mediate the Na+/K+-dependent uptake of the amino acids l-glutamate and dl-aspartate. In the nervous system, these proteins contribute to the clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft and maintain excitatory amino acid concentrations below excitotoxic levels.

Further studies of this protein are expected to shed light on the role of taurine as a candidate neuromodulator and cell survival factor in the Drosophila nervous system. The vertebrate glutamate/neutral amino acid transporter family is composed of five glutamate/aspartate transporters, also designated the XAG system or EAATs, 1The abbreviations used are: EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; ANOVA, analysis of variance; ASCT, alanine-serine-cysteine transporter; dEAAT, Drosophila EAAT; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TBOA, dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate; UAS, upstream activating sequence. and two neutral amino acid transporters known as alanine-serine-cysteine transporters 1 and 2 (ASCT1 and ASCT2) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar and 2Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The EAATs are credited with many aspects of brain functioning in normal and disease states, including synaptic signal termination, transmitter recycling, prevention of excitotoxicity, and homeostatic regulation of excitatory amino acid levels. In Drosophila, two EAATs have been identified, namely dEAAT1, which ensures glutamate buffering in the brain (3Rival T. Soustelle L. Strambi C. Besson M.T. Iche M. Birman S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 599-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and dEAAT2, which has an unknown function. Both transporters are specifically expressed in the nervous system (4Besson M.T. Soustelle L. Birman S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Soustelle L. Besson M.T. Rival T. Birman S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All of the EAAT proteins share nearly identical hydropathy profiles and predicted membrane topologies. However, transport mechanisms can differ considerably in this family (2Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For instance, we reported previously that dEAAT2 exhibits a unique preference for d- and l-aspartate as substrates over l-glutamate (6Besson M.T. Soustelle L. Birman S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas all of the other known EAATs transport l-glutamate and d- or l-aspartate with similar affinities (7Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taurine is the second most abundant amino acid after glutamate in the mammalian and insect brains (8Huxtable R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1989; 32: 471-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 9Bicker G. Brain Res. 1991; 560: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Stevenson P.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 404: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This sulfur-containing amino acid is widely, although not evenly, distributed in neural and non-neural tissues. In the mammalian brain, extracellular levels of taurine are regulated by two specific, high affinity transporters with significant sequence homology to GABA transporters (11Liu Q.R. Lopez-Corcuera B. Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12145-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 12Smith K.E. Borden L.A. Wang C.H. Hartig P.R. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 563-569PubMed Google Scholar), which are not related to EAATs. The physiological functions of taurine and its transporters in the nervous system remain poorly understood. Taurine appears to act as an osmolyte in cell volume regulation (13Hussy N. Deleuze C. Desarmenien M.G. Moos F.C. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2000; 62: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 14Schaffer S.W. Lombardini J.B. Azuma J.

Res. 2002; 27: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and a neuromodulator (16Oja S.S. Saransaari P. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), especially in developing nervous systems (17Trenkner E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 268: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the hippocampus, taurine protects neural cells from excitotoxic damage induced by massive release of EAAs under ischemic or hypoxic conditions (18Saransaari P. Oja S.S. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2000; 19: 509-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and from free radical injury (19Saransaari P. Oja S.S. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2004; 26: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that taurine inhibits neuronal discharges by acting as an agonist at GABAA (20del Olmo N. Bustamante J. del Rio R.M. Solis J.M. Brain Res. 2000; 864: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and glycine receptors (21Jiang Z. Krnjevic K. Wang F. Ye J.H. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Taurine also plays a role in long lasting changes in synaptic activity (22del Olmo N. Galarreta M. Bustamante J. Martin del Rio R. Solis J.M. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 40-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Chepkova A.N. Doreulee N. Yanovsky Y. Mukhopadhyay D. Haas H.L. Sergeeva O.A. Eur. J.

Haas H.L. J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, taurine appears to be linked to various physiological functions and could interact at different levels with neurotransmitter systems (25El Idrissi A. Trenkner E. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Here we tested a number of neuroactive compounds for their ability to interfere with dEAAT2-mediated d-aspartate transport. We found that three insect neurotransmitters, GABA, histamine, and octopamine, were inefficient at competing and that only high concentrations of l-cysteine and l-cystine somewhat decreased d-aspartate uptake. In contrast and surprisingly, we observed that taurine markedly inhibited d-aspartate uptake by dEAAT2 and that this transporter mediates high affinity Na+-dependent uptake of taurine. Specific antagonists of the mammalian taurine transporters have no inhibitory effect on dEAAT2. High affinity taurine transport may be a specific property of dEAAT2 in this family, because it was not shared by two other EAATs we tested, Drosophila dEAAT1 and the human transporter hEAAT2. Additionally, we observed that taurine and d-aspartate acted as mutual competitive inhibitors for dEAAT2 transport and that this transporter can operate in an exchange mode with a preferred orientation, namely d-aspartate outwards and taurine inwards. Chemicals—d-[2,3-3H]Aspartic acid and [1,2-3H]taurine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. l-Glutamine and l-cysteine were purchased from Fluka, guanidinoethyl sulfonate was from Toronto Research Chemicals, and dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA) came from Tocris. Cell culture reagents and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Drosophila Cell Culture and Transfections—The Drosophila Schneider cell line S2 was propagated at 22.5 °C in Falcon flasks into 10 ml of Shields and Sang medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Abcys), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Most experiments were carried out with a stably dEAAT2-transformed cell line (6Besson M.T. Soustelle L. Birman S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) named dEAAT2-S2 that was maintained by hygromycin resistance. Transient co-transfections were performed using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) in 100-mm plates according to the manufacturer's protocol. These transfections were carried out with the GAL4/UAS-coupled inducible gene expression system as described (26Brodsky M.H. Nordstrom W. Tsang G. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Abrams J.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) by co-transfecting a plasmid containing UAS upstream of the cDNA of interest with a plasmid containing the GAL4 sequence under control of the metallothionein promoter (pMT-GAL4). Control cells were transfected with the pMT-GAL4 vector alone. A pUAS-GFP plasmid was co-transfected to monitor transfection efficiencies between the different plates. One day after transfection, CuSO4 was added to each plate at a 500 μm concentration, and the plates were incubated at 25 °C. Two days later, the cells were counted, dispatched at 2 × 106 cell density/ml in 6-well plates, and used for uptake experiments. DNA Constructions—Construction of the pUAS-dEAAT1 and pUAS-hEAAT2 plasmids were described previously (3Rival T. Soustelle L. Strambi C. Besson M.T. Iche M. Birman S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 599-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To generate the pUAS-dEAAT2 plasmid, a 2192-bp SspI fragment from the dEAAT2 cDNA was inserted into the dephosphorylated pUAST vector (27Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously digested by EcoRI and blunted. A BamHI-NotI fragment containing the enhanced GFP sequence was excised from the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) and inserted into the BamHI-NotI sites of the pUAST plasmid to make the pUAS-GFP plasmid. Amino Acid Uptakes—Transport assays were conducted in 6-well plates as described previously (6Besson M.T. Soustelle L. Birman S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The standard incubation medium contained 96 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 62.5 mmd-mannitol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 1 μCi of d-[2,3-3H]aspartic acid or [1,2-3H]taurine supplemented with the corresponding unlabeled amino acids to 1 μm final concentration. After 2 min at room temperature, the uptake was stopped by washing the cells with 9 ml of total cold Na+-free buffer in which NaCl was replaced by 250 mmd-mannitol. The cells were finally air-dried and lysed with 500 μl of 1 n NaOH. Aliquots were taken from each well for liquid scintillation counting and protein determination by the Lowry method. Experiments were always performed in parallel with native and transfected S2 cells. The Na+ dependence of taurine transport was determined by substituting osmolar equivalents of d-mannitol for NaCl. For competition experiments, the competitor was applied at the indicated concentrations together with 1 μm tritiated substrate. For efflux studies, dEAAT2-S2 cells were preloaded for 30 min with 1 μmd-[3H]aspartate or 1 μm [3H]taurine in standard uptake medium and then rapidly washed out with 5 ml of ice-cold Na+-free buffer. Efflux was started by replacing the ice-cold Na+-free buffer with 500 μl of either Na+-free buffer (control) or standard uptake medium at room temperature, both containing 300 μm unlabeled d-aspartate or taurine. After 2 min of efflux, plates were placed on ice, and a sample of 100 μl of the extracellular medium was collected from each well for liquid scintillation counting. For influx measurements, dEAAT2-S2 cells were preloaded for 30 min with 1 μm unlabeled d-aspartate or taurine in standard uptake medium and subsequently treated as in efflux, except that the external medium (Na+-free buffer for the control or standard buffer for the assay) was supplemented with 300 μmd-aspartate or taurine containing 1 μCi of their respective radiotracer. After 2 min of influx reaction at room temperature, plates were placed on ice. The cells were washed with 9 ml of cold Na+-free buffer, and radioactivity content was determined in the usual manner. HPLC Measurements of Extracellular Amino Acid—The dEAAT2-S2 cells that were not preloaded were placed in 1 ml of standard uptake medium, and 10 μl of extracellular medium were taken at different time points after the addition of 300 μm taurine or d-aspartate in the medium (t = 0). At the end of the experiment (t = 180 min), all samples were frozen and stored at -80 °C until used for HPLC detection as described in (28Re D.B. Boucraut J. Samuel D. Birman S. Kerkerian-Le Goff L. Had-Aissouni L. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of separate experiments measured in triplicates. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and MacCurveFit (Kevin Raner) software. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat software or StatXAct for non-parametric tests as described in each figure legend. Taurine Selectively Inhibits dEAAT2-mediated Aspartate Transport—Fig. 1 shows the effects of increasing concentrations of various neuroactive molecules on d-aspartate transport by the stably transfected dEAAT2-S2 cells. We found that 1 μmd-[3H]aspartate uptake was strongly inhibited by taurine in a concentration-dependent manner, i.e. the presence of 10 μm, 100 μm, and 1 mm taurine resulted in decreases of 28, 76, and 98%, respectively. Other compounds including GABA, histamine, and octopamine, whose transporters belong to the same family as the mammalian taurine transporters (29Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), or glutamine had no inhibitory effect. Only high concentrations of l-cysteine and l-cystine (∼100 μm) partly reduced d-[3H]aspartate uptake. These results indicate that taurine has a specific ability to block aspartate transport mediated by dEAAT2. We then compared the effect of taurine on d-aspartate uptake by dEAAT2 and two others EAATs, namely the Drosophila dEAAT1 and the human hEAAT2 glutamate/aspartate transporters. Transient transfections of these different transporters into S2 cells with the UAS-GAL4 system were performed in parallel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” d-[3H]Aspartate uptakes were then assayed in the presence of increasing levels of taurine (Fig. 2). The dEAAT1- and hEAAT2-expressing cells captured d-aspartate with similar efficiency in the absence or presence of taurine at whichever concentration was used. In contrast, 10 μm taurine significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited 1 μmd-[3H]aspartate uptake by dEAAT2. At higher taurine concentrations (100 μm and 1 mm), the d-aspartate transport into dEAAT2-expressing cells became not statistically different from the nonspecific uptake in control cells. Therefore, inhibition of d-aspartate uptake by taurine may be a specific property of the dEAAT2 transporter in the EAAT family. dEAAT2 Is a High Affinity Taurine Transporter—We then observed that the dEAAT2-S2 cells were able to take up tritiated taurine from the external medium. The kinetic parameters of taurine transport by dEAAT2 were determined from dose-response experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, taurine uptake into dEAAT2-S2 cells was dose-dependent, reached saturation at high concentrations, and fitted well with the Michaelis-Menten function. Taurine transport was linear within the first 10 min of incubation (data not shown). Determined by Lineweaver-Burk plot data analyses, the mean Km value for taurine uptake was 45.74 ± 5.28 μm (n = 7), indicating a high affinity transport. This Km was somewhat higher but not statistically different from the Km of dEAAT2 for d-aspartate, which is 32.52 ± 5.77 μm (n = 7) (Table II). In contrast, the Vmax of dEAAT2 for taurine transport (293.06 ± 32.76 pmol/min/mg protein) was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than that for d-aspartate transport (151.32 ± 29.81 pmol/min/mg protein). Relative efficacy (Vmax/Km) was comparable for the two substrates. Therefore, dEAAT2 can be described as a high affinity taurine/aspartate transporter in Drosophila.Table IITaurine and d-aspartate are reciprocal competitive inhibitors of dEAAT2 transportTritiated taurine uptaked-aspartateKmVariation indexVmaxVariation indexμmμmpmol/min/mg045.74 ± 5.281293.06 ± 32.7611091.53 ± 11.142242 ± 88.630.810001217.1 ± 380.64ap < 0.05.27490.73 ± 183.771.7Tritiated d-aspartate uptakeTaurineKmVariation indexVmaxVariation indexμmμmpmol/min/mg032.52 ± 5.771151.32 ± 29.8111065.67 ± 7.59262.1 ± 9.370.41000979.67 ± 340.13ap < 0.05.30101.43 ± 26.230.7a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Sodium Dependence and Pharmacology of Taurine Transport by dEAAT2—The Na+ dependence of taurine uptake was investigated in both a Na+-free medium and a standard uptake medium. Fig. 4A shows that taurine uptake in dEAAT2-S2 cells was highly dependent on the presence of Na+ ions, whereas the low background level of taurine uptake (10.5%) observed in control cells was not Na+-dependent. Moreover, 300 μm TBOA, a specific, non-transportable inhibitor of all known EAATs (30Shimamoto K. Lebrun B. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Sakaitani M. Shigeri Y. Yumoto N. Nakajima T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), abolished the Na+-dependent component of taurine uptake (Fig. 4B), indicating that dEAAT2 triggered the whole Na+-dependent uptake of taurine in these cells. Further pharmacological properties of the dEAAT2-mediated taurine transport were analyzed with antagonists of the mammalian taurine transporters (Table I). In the presence of 1 μm [3H]taurine, significant inhibition of taurine uptake by dEAAT2 was observed only with 1 mm hypotaurine, whereas 10 μm hypotaurine is sufficient to block taurine transport by the mammalian transporters (11Liu Q.R.

The other substances tested, β-alanine and guanidinoethyl sulfonate, which are known to be slightly less potent than hypotaurine, had no effect in our experiments. Therefore, taurine transport by dEAAT2 is pharmacologically distinct from taurine transport by the structurally unrelated mammalian transporters.Table IEffect of mammalian taurine transport inhibitors on dEAAT2-mediated taurine uptakeAntagonistConcentrationUptake rateμm%Control100 ± 4Hypotaurine183.9 ± 13.51086.5 ± 13.310087.5 ± 17.8100055.4 ± 6.9aA significant statistical difference (p < 0.05) was detected by ANOVA and the Tukey test for multiple comparison procedures.β-Alanine193.1 ± 10.810101.7 ± 1910090.2 ± 12.51000111.2 ± 16.3GESbGuanidinoethyl sulfonate.190.7 ± 18.41094.5 ± 15.3100100.4 ± 211000101.3 ± 8.1a A significant statistical difference (p < 0.05) was detected by ANOVA and the Tukey test for multiple comparison procedures.b Guanidinoethyl sulfonate. Open table in a new tab Taurine and Aspartate Are Mutual Competitive Inhibitors of Transport by dEAAT2—To determine the nature of the interactions between the two substrates, we tested the dose effect of taurine on the kinetic properties of d-aspartate uptake and the converse. The parameters of tritiated amino acid transport were determined over a concentration range of 30–500 μm. Results are summarized in Table II. d-aspartate and taurine were found to be competitive inhibitors of each other, as the presence of the other unlabeled substrate led to an increase in Km values that was significant at 1 mm with no statistically significant change in Vmax values. dEAAT2 Mediates Asymmetric Heteroexchange—Because some transporters can mediate exchanges between extracellular and intracellular pools of amino acids (31Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32Pinilla J. Barber A. Lostao M.P. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we examined this possibility for dEAAT2. First, we tested the ability of dEAAT2 to mediate efflux of aspartate or taurine by HPLC monitoring in the presence of exogenously supplied taurine or d-aspartate, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the addition of taurine in the extracellular medium produced a time-dependent efflux of aspartate whereas no release was observed in untreated dEAAT2-S2 cells, indicating that the transporter can mediate heteroexchange. In contrast, the addition of aspartate in the extracellular medium did not elicit taurine efflux (data not shown). However, this result was expected because the dEAAT2-S2 cells do not natively contain detectable levels of taurine. We then performed outward and inward reciprocal measures of radiolabeled d-aspartate and taurine transport after the preloading of each amino acid substrate (Fig. 6). For efflux studies, dEAAT2-S2 cells were preloaded with 1 μm tritiated amino acid and subsequently superfused with the other unlabeled amino acid (300 μm). Influx rates were measured by the incubation of unlabeled amino acid-preloaded cells in the other tritiated amino acid (300 μm). High levels of extracellular taurine triggered outward and inward fluxes of the tritiated amino acids, because d-[3H]aspartate efflux and [3H]taurine influx were observed. The taurine influx rate was found to be very similar to the d-aspartate efflux rate. This suggests that the amount of released d-aspartate was equal to the amount of taurine taken up into cells. In contrast, the presence of d-aspartate on the external side of the cell membrane and taurine inside induced weak fluxes of either radioactive amino acid, suggesting an inhibition of the transporter in these conditions. Therefore, dEAAT2 can mediate heteroexchange of its two substrates, but only when taurine is outside and aspartate inside.Fig. 6Asymmetry of dEAAT2-mediated heteroexchange. dEAAT2-S2 cells were preloaded and assayed for efflux (hatched bars) and influx (gray bars) transports of the indicated amino acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Efflux data correspond to the Na+-dependent exchange of intracellular tritiated amino acid (1 μm) driven by the presence of the other unlabeled amino acid (300 μm) transport in the external medium. Influx data correspond to the Na+-dependent transport of external tritiated amino acid (300 μm) into cells preloaded with the other unlabeled amino acid substrate (1 μm).

Soustelle L. Birman S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we report a novel unexpected feature of this protein, i.e. its ability to transport taurine with as high affinity and efficacy as aspartate. We observed that taurine is a potent and specific competitor of d-aspartate uptake by dEAAT2. This property is not shared by other neuroactive molecules such as GABA, the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian and insect brain, octopamine, a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in invertebrates (33Roeder T. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1999; 59: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and histamine, which is required for photoreceptor synaptic transmission in insects (34Nassel D.R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 44: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similarly, glutamine, a putative precursor of neuronal pools of glutamate (35Broer S. Brookes N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), is not a competitor for dEAAT2-mediated aspartate uptake. Only high levels of l-cysteine and l-cystine partly inhibited d-aspartate transport by dEAAT2. l-Cysteine is known as a substrate of EAAC1, its human homologue hEAAT3 (31Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 36Chen Y. Swanson R.A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the neutral ASCTs (37Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A. Wu Y.N. Murdoch G.H. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15329-15332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on mammalian cultured neurons and astrocytes showed that l-cystine uptake occurs by Na+-independent and Na+-dependent processes, including EAATs (38Bender A.S. Reichelt W. Norenberg M.D. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39Shanker G. Aschner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 40Patel S.A. Warren B.A. Rhoderick J.F. Bridges R.J. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, these amino acids could act as low affinity substrates of dEAAT2. Alternatively, high concentrations of l-cysteine and l-cystine could trigger taurine synthesis in S2 cells, which would inhibit dEAAT2-mediated aspartate uptake by transinhibition (see below). Indeed, l-cysteine was shown to be a direct metabolic precursor of taurine in astroglial cells (41Brand A. Leibfritz D. Hamprecht B. Dringen R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The effect of taurine on d-aspartate uptake appears to be specific to dEAAT2, as it was not observed with two other transporters of the family, namely the Drosophila glutamate transporter dEAAT1 and hEAAT2, the major EAAT protein in the human brain. These three transporters were able to take up d-aspartate with similar efficiency after transient transfection in S2 cells. However, only the d-aspartate transport mediated by dEAAT2 was inhibited by taurine in a dose-dependent manner. High affinity transport of [3H]taurine by dEAAT2 was demonstrated that has strict dependence on extracellular Na+ ions. Kinetic analysis shows that dEAAT2 discriminates between aspartate and glutamate (6Besson M.T. Soustelle L. Birman S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) but not between aspartate and taurine. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that a protein of the EAAT family can accept taurine as substrate. Furthermore, the taurine transport mediated by dEAAT2 is clearly distinct from mammalian taurine transport. First, the two known mammalian taurine transporters are not structurally related to the EAAT proteins. Second, mammalian taurine transport inhibitors are not competitors for taurine uptake by dEAAT2. These findings suggest that the site for taurine binding on the dEAAT2 protein is not accessible to the usual taurine inhibitors but is conformed such that the specific EAAT inhibitor TBOA (30Shimamoto K. Lebrun B. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Sakaitani M. Shigeri Y. Yumoto N. Nakajima T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) can efficiently reduce taurine transport. These observations indicate that dEAAT2 possesses comparable pharmacology but quite distinct substrate specificity compared with other EAATs. dEAAT2 transports d-aspartate and taurine with comparable relative efficacy, and the two substrates are reciprocal competitive inhibitors. Indeed the Km for taurine uptake presents a significant increase when d-aspartate concentration increases and vice versa, whereas their respective Vmax values are not significantly modified. Moreover, there is no apparent difference in transport inhibition potency between d-aspartate and taurine as attested by the similar Km variation indexes. Overall, these data suggest that the sites to which d-aspartate and taurine bind on the transporter have an equivalent accessibility and could be the same. The vertebrate glutamate/neutral transporters can behave as amino acid exchangers (2Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 42Dunlop J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A glutamate-cysteine exchange through EAAC1 (human EAAT3) has been described (31Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and cysteine uptake appears to be predominantly mediated by this transporter in neuron cultures (36Chen Y. Swanson R.A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The neutral transporters ASCT1 and ASCT2 were reported to function exclusively as amino acid exchangers (43Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27991-27994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 44Broer A. Wagner C. Lang F. Broer S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), whereas EAATs mediate both uptake and exchange modes at various levels. Our results indicate that dEAAT2 is able to function in two modes, exchange and uptake. Although further experiments are needed to confirm this possibility, we can postulate that the transport of taurine by dEAAT2 could be mediated either by uptake or by heteroexchange in brain cells containing aspartate. However the transport of aspartate may occur by uptake only, because taurine outward/aspartate inward heteroexchange is not carried out by dEAAT2. Furthermore, aspartate uptake itself is inhibited under these conditions, suggesting a mechanism of transinhibition (45Pall M.L. Kelly K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 940-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 46Debernardi R. Magistretti P.J. Pellerin L. Brain Res. 1999; 850: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) by intracellular taurine that would efficiently block dEAAT2-mediated transport. In insects, taurine is a major free amino acid. Its presence has been detected by immunostaining in nerve fibers of the honeybee central and peripheral nervous systems (47Schafer S. Bicker G. Ottersen O.P. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1988; 268: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 48Eichmuller S. Schafer S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 352: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Taurine is generally reported to interact with neurotransmitter systems, and taurine-immunopositive cells have been co-localized in octopaminergic neurons (49Nurnberger A. Rapus J. Eckert M. Penzlin H. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), histaminergic photoreceptors (9Bicker G. Brain Res. 1991; 560: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and GABAergic neurons (10Stevenson P.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 404: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that, in insects, taurine could function as a neuromodulator co-released with amines. A taurine immunoreactivity, spatially distinct from that of two other candidate neurotransmitters, aspartate and glutamate, has been recently described in the cockroach and Drosophila mushroom bodies (50Sinakevitch I. Farris S.M. Strausfeld N.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 352-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 51Strausfeld N.J. Sinakevitch I. Vilinsky I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 62: 151-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The mushroom bodies are an integrative brain structure involved in learning and memory in insects. These studies show that taurine distribution is comparable with the expression of a neurotransmitter in the insect brain. This is also in agreement with the various roles of taurine suggested by vertebrate studies on developmental plasticity and the long term potentiation of synaptic transmission (16Oja S.S. Saransaari P. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Trenkner E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 268: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25El Idrissi A. Trenkner E. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). From our results, we conclude that dEAAT2 mediates taurine and aspartate transport in the Drosophila nervous system by a common mechanism, these two amino acids being equally favorite substrates of this transporter. Although the precise functions of these two amino acids in the insect nervous system physiology are still unknown, dEAAT2 seems to be a good candidate gene to modulate the function of taurine in the fly brain.
