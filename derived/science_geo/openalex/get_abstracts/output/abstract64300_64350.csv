A marked diurnal variation in plasma concentrations was demonstrated, with highest values during sleep; periods of episodic release occurred throughout the 24 hours."

From the morphology of the disks and the dependence of microtubule assembly on the presence of these structures, we propose that the disks are nucleation centers for the polymerization of microtubule protein."
https://openalex.org/W2091764078,"Intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine produced 95 percent depletion of telencephalic norepinephrine and 62 percent depletion of striatal dopamine in rats. Treated rats maintained body weight at subnormal levels and failed to increase food intake in response to a short-term decrease in glucose utilization. After treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline, 6-hydroxydopamine produced no further norepinephrine depletion but increased the dopamnine depletion to 95 percent and produced complete aphagia. These effects are comparable to events that follow bilateral electrolytic lesions of the lateral hypothalanmus."
https://openalex.org/W1520097912,"C55-Isoprenoid alcohol phosphokinase from Staphylococcus aureus has been purified by the following methods: cooling of a butanol extract to 0° and then to -20° followed by treatment of the dried enzyme with methanol containing increasing amounts of butanol-1. At a concentration of 30% butanol in methanol, enzyme is eluted as a lipoprotein that is purified 627-fold with respect to protein and about 40-fold with respect to lipid phosphate. Qualitative changes in the lipid composition of the purified preparation were demonstrated as well as a simplification of the protein distribution seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Some properties of this lipoprotein are described. Two more purification steps in organic solvents (chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and chromatography on hydroxypropylated Sephadex G-50) led to apoprotein of near homogeneity. The hydroxypropylated Sephadex G-50 column was shown to separate proteins below molecular weight of 30,000 according to molecular weight. The enzyme activity appeared to be associated with a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 17,000."
https://openalex.org/W1544261684,"Abstract Carnitine palmityltransferase in rat liver was investigated by three different assay methods. Intracellular distribution studies showed that carnitine palmityltransferase was an exclusively mitochondrial enzyme. Digitonin fractionation of rat liver mitochondria demonstrated that carnitine palmityltransferase had a dual localization within the mitochondria. The enzymatic activity catalyzing the formation of palmityl-l-carnitine from palmityl-CoA and l-carnitine, designated carnitine palmityltransferase A, was loosely bound to the external surface of the inner membrane. Digitonin treatment released this enzymatic activity from mitochondria resulting in a preparation which had a severely limited ability for carnitine-dependent palmityl-CoA oxidation, but retained the ability to oxidize palmityl-l-carnitine. The other mitochondrial enzymatic activity, carnitine palmityltransferase B, catalyzed the formation of intramitochondrial palmityl-CoA from exogenous palmityl-l-carnitine and endogenous CoA. It was firmly bound to the inner membranes and not released by digitonin. An unusual biphasic CoA-saturation curve was observed for mitochondrial carnitine palmityltransferase. The possibility was explored that the biphasic CoA-saturation curve reflected different CoA affinities for the two carnitine palmityltransferases in mitochondria. CoA-saturation curves were done on fractions isolated following digitonin treatment of mitochondria which were enriched with either carnitine palmityltransferase A or B activity. In these crude fractions half-maximal activity occurred at CoA concentrations which differed by only about 0.5 mm CoA. Therefore, following fractionation, instead of a magnification of differences in CoA affinity, suggested by the biphasic curve, the observed values revealed no significant differences. The designations, carnitine palmityltransferase A and B, represent enzymatic activities in two different intramitochondrial compartments with different functional roles. Further evidence is needed to determine if these are isoenzymes. A scheme is proposed for the role of the two carnitine palmityltransferase activities in the oxidation of long chain fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2095225260,The use of a sensitive enzymatic assay demonstrates that tryptamine occurs normally in rat brain. Intracisternal administration of [(14)C]tryptamine results in the formation of N-methyl-and dimethyltryptamine(a psychotomimetic compound)in the rat brain. An enzyme that converts tryptamine and N-methyl-tryptamine to N-methyl-and dimethyltryptamine was found to be present in rat and human brain. The N-methylation of tryptamine was inhibited by normally occurring compounds present in rat brain.
https://openalex.org/W1970073071,"The rate of invasion of carbon dioxide into an artificially eutrophic Canadian Shield lake with insufficient internal sources of carbon was determined by two methods: measuring the carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus ratios of seston after weekly additions of nitrogen and phosphorus, and measuring the loss of radon-222 tracer from the epilimnion. Both methods gave an invasion rate of about 0.2 gram of carbon per square meter per day. The results demonstrate that invasion of atmospheric carbon dioxide may be sufficient to permit eutrophication of any body of water receiving an adequate supply of phosphorus and nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1556587647,"Abstract The two types of human fibrinogen (Peaks 1 and 2) distinguishable by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose were isolated and the S-sulfo derivatives of the constituent Aα, Bβ, and γ chains separated and examined. No differences were found between the Aα and Bβ chains of Peak 1 fibrinogen and the corresponding chains of Peak 2 fibrinogen with respect to their chromatographic elution profiles, electrophoretic migration at pH 8.6 or 2.7, molecular size, or tryptic peptide maps. By chromatography on CM-cellulose, the γ chains of both types of fibrinogen were resolved into two approximately equal populations, designated γ-I (first eluted) and γ-2. Upon electrophoresis at pH 8.6 or 2.7 both the γ-1 and γ-2 chains of Peak 1 fibrinogen migrated as a single band. The corresponding chromatographically isolated chains of Peak 2 fibrinogen separated into two bands, designated γ and γ'. The γ' chains, which were the more anodal, amounted to about half of the γ chain population of Peak 2 fibrinogen. The γ chains of Peak 2 fibrinogen exhibited the same mobility as the corresponding chains of Peak 1 fibrinogen. The γ:γ' heterogeneity accounts for the charge difference between unmodified Peak 1 and Peak 2 fibrinogen. As assessed by electrophoretic experiments in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate after reduction of disulfide bonds, all γ chain variants were of the same molecular size and were capable of covalent cross-linking."

However, despite these gross and frequent deformations of the image, perceived properties remain extraordinarily stable. Such constancy has obvious biological utility; the observer perceives his world according to its fixed physical features rather than in terms of its variable sensory representation."
https://openalex.org/W2089790288,"Rats were trained with a tone being followed by either food or electric shock, on alternate days. Unit activity during application of the conditioned stimulus was recorded from the dorsal hippocampus. The results indicate differentiation of the hippocampal system. Dentate units respond by augmentation to a conditioned stimulus which leads to food and by inhibition to the same stimulus when it precedes electric shock. The hippocampus proper responds by augmentation in both situations. The intensity of the hippocampal response to the conditioned stimulus on the first day of training is higher if the unconditioned stimulus is food than if it is electric shock. These data cast light on the functions of the dorsal dentate-hippocampal connections and the hippocampus proper during aversive and appetitive conditioning."

With correction, motion thresholds decreased and inidividual differences disappeared. These results imply that under normal observation conditions, peripheral sensitivity is limited mainly by dioptric rather than retinal variables."
https://openalex.org/W1564482854,"Thermal transition enthalpy changes (ΔHf) were investigated in intact and soluble collagen from a variety of sources and species utilizing differential scanning calorimetry. Results indicated that the ΔHf determinations were not dependent on sample size, method of preparation, or sample purity. The ΔHf values for intact collagen were virtually identical with those from tropocollagen preparations, confirming previous conclusions that the state of aggregation or extent of covalent cross-linking plays only a minor role in the thermal stability of collagen. The experimentally determined values for the enthalpy change per residue (ΔHr) were 1055 cal per mole and appeared to be invariant in all the collagens studied. The denaturation energy per triplet averaged 3000 cal per mole, suggesting that forces other than hydrogen bonding must be contributing to denaturation enthalpy. A correlation between thermal denaturation or shrinkage temperature and total pyrrolidine content was evident. The entropy change per residue also increased with decreasing imino acid content. These results tend to support the conclusion that the tertiary superhelix structure of the collagen molecule is stabilized primarily by the steric restrictions imposed by the pyrrolidine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1508105644,"Abstract Cotton cotyledons have been found to synthesize de novo during germination two enzymes, a carboxypeptidase and isocitratase. The mRNA for this synthesis is transcribed in embryogenesis at a point when the embryos have reached two-thirds of their final size. The translation of the mRNA is prevented during the completion of embryogenesis by the plant hormone abscisic acid, which is produced by the tissues surrounding the embryo and absorbed by the embryo. The inhibition of the translation of the mRNA appears to require the concomitant synthesis of nonribosomal RNA. The mRNA for the two enzymes can be prematurely induced in younger cotyledons by excision of the embryo from the mother plant. This also stops DNA synthesis and cell division in this tissue. The synthesis of the mRNA and the cessation of DNA synthesis and cell division normally occur at the time in embryogenesis when the vascular connection between the mother plant and the incipient seed degenerates. It is postulated that these events are the result of a loss of vascular factors supplied by the mother plant. The synthesis of the two enzymes appears to be identically regulated, and they may represent a body of enzymes that are required for germination and whose synthesis is under the same coordinated regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2013981561,"The effects of short- and long-term administration of morphine on the activity of two measurable forms of rat brain tryptophan hydroxylase were studied. Morphine administration produced an immediate decrease and a longterm increase in the nerve ending (particulate) enzyme activity but did not change the cell body (soluble) enzyme activity. Cocaine administration demnonstrated a short-term decrcease in measurable nerve eniding enzyme activity that was due to the inhibition of the high affinity uptake (the Michaelis constant, K(m) is 10-(5) molar) of trytophan, the serotonin precursor. Cocaine did not aflect the low affinity uptake K(m) = 10-(5) molar) of tryptophan. Both the uptake of the precursor and the enizymiie activity appeared to be drug-sensitive regullatory processes in the biosynthlesis of serotonin."
https://openalex.org/W1576708451,"Abstract The substrate specificity of bovine liver crotonase has been examined with seven Δ2, 3-trans-enoyl-CoA substrates, containing an even number of carbon atoms. The Vmax for this series decreases progressively from a value of about 340,000 moles per min per mole of enzyme for crotonyl-CoA, the C4 derivative, to 2,300 for the C16 derivative. The action of several CoA derivatives on crotonase has been tested. None were found to stimulate the enzyme and only one derivative, acetoacetyl-CoA, was found to be markedly inhibitory. Evidence was obtained that the enolate form of acetoacetyl CoA was the inhibitory species and acted as a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 1.6 x 10-6 m, a value about ten times lower than the Km for the best substrate, crotonyl-CoA. The interaction of acetoacetyl-CoA with crotonase was studied by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy and it was found that 6 molecules of inhibitor were bound per molecule of enzyme, or an average of one per subunit. This suggests that there are six active sites per molecule of native enzyme. The binding constant for the inhibitor was about equal to the kinetically determined value for Ki. The catalytic properties of crotonase have been compared with the turnover numbers and substrate specificities of the other enzymes acting in β oxidation of fatty acyl-CoA derivatives. This comparison suggests that crotonase, by virtue of its substrate specificity and its sensitivity to feedback inhibition by acetoacetyl-CoA, may play a regulatory role in fatty acid oxidation. The effects of acetoacetyl-CoA on the rate of oxidation of butyric, octanoic, and palmitic acids by heart muscle or liver mitochondria were those expected if crotonase is acting, at least in part, to regulate fatty acid oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1997956070,"Peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used to determine the histologic and cytologic localization of bovine and human tissue factor (thromboplastin). Tissue factor antigen was found in highest concentration in the intima of blood vessels, particularly in the plasma membranes of endothelial cells and in human atheromatous plaques. Tissue factor was also found limited to the plasma membranes of many cell types. The presence of tissue factor in the plasma membranes of endothelial cells and atheromata suggests that it may play a significant role in hemostasis and thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W1587500786,"Abstract The kinetics of incorporation of [14C]glycine into the cyanogen bromide peptides of the α1 and α2 chains of pulse-labeled collagen was analyzed in a system of cranial bone (calvaria) from newborn rats. From the time dependence of the difference in specific activity between peptides in the same chain, it was estimated that the rate of translation of the mRNA for a collagen chain is about 209 residues per min and is approximately equal for both α1 and α2. The data indicate that hydroxylation and helix formation occur either during translation or very rapidly thereafter. It was determined that the samples consisted in part of collagen obtained by conversion of precursor (procollagen) during neutral salt extraction. The pro α1 chain from acid-extracted samples was found to have a molecular weight of 115,000 compared to 95,000 for an α 1 chain. The calculated assembly time for a pro α chain, and for a completed procollagen molecule, is then 6.0 min, assuming linear polypeptide chains of 1,250 residues and a constant translation rate. The kinetic analysis allows the prediction that the extra peptide material that is lost during conversion of procollagen is at the amino-terminal ends of the chains. The time previously calculated (Vuust, J., and Piez, K. A. (1970) J. Biol. Chem., 245, 6201) from pulse-labeling studies for the biosynthesis of a complete fully hydroxylated collagen molecule, 4.8 min, can now be seen to be an apparent value obtained as a result of the then unknown conversion of procollagen to collagen during extraction. Re-evaluation of those data leads to a biosynthesis time of 5.8 min for a procollagen molecule, in good agreement with the present study. The rate of conversion to collagen is not known."
https://openalex.org/W2089515131,Interhemispheric asymmetries of different magnitudes were observed in human cortical auditory evoked responses to speech and sound-effect stimuli. The wave with peak asymmetry occurred 100 milliseconds after signal onset. The amount of asymmetry of the amplitude of this wave was related to the meaningfulness to the subject of the auditory stimulus rather than to the mere use of verbal versus nonverbal materials.
https://openalex.org/W1490920850,"Abstract Two tridecapeptides containing nonmethylated histidine residues have been isolated from tryptic digests of rabbit and bovine cardiac myosins with the following sequences, respectively: Leu-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Asp-Ile-Asp-His-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Lys; Leu-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Asp-Ile-Asp-His-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Lys. The peptides are homologous to the peptide containing 3-methylhistidine from rabbit skeletal muscle myosin (Huszar, G., and Elzinga, M. (1971) Biochemistry, 10, 229). There are four differences in the sequences of the rabbit skeletal and rabbit cardiac myosin peptides: Gly → Ser; Ile → Leu; Val → Ile; Thr → Asn. There is one difference in sequence between the cardiac peptides from rabbit and calf (Ser → Gly), indicating that this particular region of the primary structure of the myosin molecule is more similar in sequence in the same tissue from two different species than in heart and skeletal muscle of rabbit. All the amino acid replacements in the peptides are conservative and can be ascribed to single base changes. Based on the differences in the sequences of the cardiac histidine and skeletal 3-methylhistidine peptides from rabbit, it can be concluded that cardiac and skeletal myosin are synthesized under the control of different genes. The presence of nonmethylated histidine in cardiac myosins and the very conservative nature of the amino acid replacements around the histidine and 3-methylhistidine in cardiac and skeletal muscle myosins suggest to us that the lack of methylation is due to the absence of a histidine-methylating enzyme in cardiac muscle."

At concentrations of 3.3 x10(-5)M, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the red cell membrane becomes unbound in vitro. The administration of propranolol to hunmns produces similar changes and results in a decrease in the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1627557876,"Abstract Livers from normal fed male rats were perfused in vitro with equimolar quantities of either palmitic acid or oleic acids, and, after an experimental period of 4 hours, the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) was isolated from the perfusate by ultracentrifugation in zonal rotors. The VLDL was characterized by rate-zonal mobility, by lipid composition, and by electrophoretic mobility on paper. Approximately 50% more VLDL triglyceride was secreted by the liver when oleate was the substrate than when palmitate was the substrate. The VLDL produced when palmitate was infused was a more dense particle and had a slower rate-zonal mobility under our conditions of zonal ultracentrifugation than did the VLDL produced from oleate. When palmitate was the substrate, the VLDL secreted by the liver was characterized by a single, apparently homogeneous peak in the density gradient in the zonal rotor, whereas the VLDL produced from oleate appeared to consist of at least two components; the lighter component behaved as a particle in its rate-zonal mobility, whereas the heavier component was similar to the VLDL produced from palmitate. Both fractions derived from oleate and the lipoprotein derived from palmitate migrated on paper as a VLDL (pre-β-lipoprotein); the lipid composition of the chylomicron-like VLDL secreted by the liver after infusion of oleate was similar to that of the chylomicrons isolated from the perfusate at the beginning of the experiment although the chylomicrons remained at the origin and did not migrate as a VLDL on paper electrophoresis. The less dense VLDL produced from oleate, furthermore, had a lipid composition which differed from that of the VLDL produced from palmitate; the lighter VLDL produced from oleate contained half as much cholesterol and phospholipid per µmole of triglyceride (TG) than either the VLDL produced from palmitate or the heavier VLDL secreted after infusion of oleate. Even though more triglyceride was secreted per gram of liver when oleate was the substrate than when palmitate was infused, the total quantity of cholesterol and phospholipid secreted, respectively, in response to either fatty acid was the same, e.g. twice as much cholesterol and phospholipid was secreted per g of liver per µmole of VLDL triglyceride derived from palmitate than from the lighter lipoprotein produced from oleate. We can conclude from these data that certain physical properties and the lipid composition of the VLDL secreted by the liver were prescribed by infusion of either palmitate or oleate; it remains to be determined whether these observations can be extended to some general relationship describing effects of saturated and unsaturated free fatty acid (FFA) on the hepatic production and properties of the VLDL. The concentration of TG, phospholipid, and cholesterol in the VLDL of serum in vivo, which is the result, in part, of hepatic secretion of VLDL, must also be regulated by the chemical structure of the FFA from which the triglyceride fatty acids are derived."
https://openalex.org/W2073888423,"Thirty-day-old corn seedlings, grown in the greenhouse with different concentrations of supplemental nitrate nitrogen, were moved to a constant-temperature growth chamber and sealed in a 560-liter tent made of polyvinyl chloride. The plants were exposed to air containing ammonia labeled with nitrogen-15 (1, 10, and 20 parts per million) for 24 hours and then harvested. The nitrogen-15 content of the tops and roots showed that at 1 part per million 43 percent of the ammonia was absorbed, whereas at 10 and 20 parts per million, 30 percent of the ammonia was absorbed. The results demonstrate that growing plants may be a natural sink for atmospheric ammonia."
https://openalex.org/W1526638050,"The acetylenic substrate, 2-hydroxy-3-butynoic acid, inactivates lactate oxidase from Mycobacterium smegmatis. When inactivated lactate oxidase is separated into flavin and apoprotein components, the apoprotein is reactivatable by exogenous FMN while the flavin has been converted to a fluorescent, reduced species stable to autoxidation. Incubation of enzyme with 2-OH-3-[4-3H]butynoate produces a 3H-labeled covalent adduct with the flavin coenzyme upon inactivation. When 2-OH[2-3H]butynoate is used, no 3H is incorporated on inactivation into either the flavocoenzyme or the apoprotein, indicating that the C2-hydrogen must be lost in the inactivation process which involves adduct formation between substrate and flavin."
https://openalex.org/W1575949733,"Abstract A lipoglycoprotein fraction extracted and purified from the ovaries of the cockroach, Leucophaea maderae, contains two components with sedimentation constants s20,w = 28.1 S and s20,w = 14.5 S. The lipid moiety consists of phospholipid and represents about 6.9% of the total weight. The carbohydrate is made up of mannose and hexosamine comprising 6.4 to 7.0% and about 1.6%, respectively, of the total weight. The hexosamine is primarily glucosamine but a trace of a second hexosamine was detected. The amino acid composition of each component is the same. The molecular weights determined by sedimentation equilibrium are 5.59 x 105 for the 14 S component and 1.59 x 106 for the 28 S component. The large fraction can be disaggregated under mild alkaline conditions and by temperatures of 65° to give several fragments, one of which has sedimentation characteristics similar to those of the 14 S component. The data support earlier work which suggested that the 28 S component was formed somewhere in the follicle from the 14 S component."

https://openalex.org/W1529886217,"Abstract Catalytic activity of the filamentous polymeric form of avian liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase, (s20,w = 45 to 47 S) undergoes first-order decay in assay reaction mixture (t½ ∼ 10 min at 2°), which is rapidly reversed (l10 s) by addition of tricarboxylic acid activator, i.e. citrate or isocitrate. As previously shown by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, extended exposure to assay reaction mixture leads to the formation of a catalytically inactive 13 to 15 S protomeric species of the enzyme. If avidin, the biotin-binding protein from egg white, is added following this decay, reactivation by citrate is blocked completely. However, when citrate is present in the assay reaction mixture, thereby maintaining the enzyme in the polymeric state, inactivation by avidin is prevented. The presence of avidin in the assay reaction mixture does not alter the t½ for activity decay, although reactivation is no longer possible upon addition of citrate. Only that fraction of carboxylase activity remaining can be protected by citrate from further erosion of activity and inactivation by avidin. Thus, the characteristics and kinetics of the decay of catalytic activity are compatible with a transition from an avidin-insensitive, active polymeric species to an avidin-sensitive, catalytically inactive form. Consistent with a polymer (intrinsic viscosity, 83) to protomer (intrinsic viscosity, 11.5) transition, the decay of enzyme activity is tightly coupled to an apparent first order (t½ = 10 min) decline in viscosity, t½ (activity) = t½ (viscosity). Citrate addition results in the rapid restoration of carboxylase activity and an abrupt rise in viscosity, equivalent to the percentage of reactivation. Tight coupling of reversible loss of enzyme activity to depolymerization is further supported by the observation that Mg2+ ATP and HCO3-, which carboxylate the enzyme, promote a rapid loss of catalytic activity (t½ = ½ min), the formation of the avidin-sensitive species, as well as, a rapid decrease in viscosity. The presence of carboxyl acceptor (acetyl-CoA), which retards activity decay (t½ = 7½ min), and susceptibility to avidin, also delays the fall in viscosity. It is proposed that the loss of catalytic activity and formation of the avidin-sensitive species reflects a polymer to protomer transition."

https://openalex.org/W1616615270,"Abstract After completion of the synthesis of protamine in the cytoplasm of rainbow trout testis spermatid cells, the seryl residues of the molecule are phosphorylated (Ingles, C. J., and Dixon, G. H. (1967) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 58, 1011). Amino acid sequence studies (Ando, T., and Watanabe, S. (1969) Int. J. Protein Res., 1, 22) of three components of rainbow trout protamine each containing 4 seryl residues show that 3 seryl residues occur together in the NH2-terminal half of each protamine in the sequence Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg and the 4th in the COOH-terminal half of the molecule in the sequence Val-Ser-Arg. It is shown here that tryptic phosphopeptides in which each seryl residue is recovered in the phosphorylated form can be isolated from protamine labeled with [32P]phosphate in vivo. In addition, a further series of phosphoseryl peptides corresponding to the sequence Arg-Ser(PO4)-Ser(PO4)-Arg have been isolated, and it is suggested that these are derived from an as yet unsequenced component of rainbow trout protamine. An ionophoretic method for determining whether a given seryl residue is phosphorylated is also described."

Vertebrate rod outer segments contain light-regulated cyclase, and light regulation is abolished by digitonin.

The data suggest that inhibitory constraint provides regulation in cyclase systems and that disruption of membrane structure uncouples catalytic and regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1496441842,"Abstract Erythropoietin stimulates the rate of RNA synthesis by fetal mouse liver erythroid cell cultures. This effect is demonstrable prior to hormone-mediated effects on DNA synthesis. Inhibition of DNA synthesis does not block erythropoietin-induced stimulation of RNA formation. Radioautographic studies have demonstrated that erythropoietin selectively stimulates the rate of RNA synthesis in the most immature erythroid cells in the culture. The hormone does not affect RNA synthesis in more mature erythroid cells nor in nonerythroid cells. Taken with previously published data, the hypothesis is developed that erythropoietin directly stimulates the proliferation and the differentiation of a specific cell which is already partially differentiated, i.e. uniquely responsive to the hormone and programmed to differentiate into hemoglobin-synthesizing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1600560489,"Abstract An enzyme catalyzing the reversible hydration of crotonylCoA has been obtained in homogeneous form from Clostridium acetobutylicum. The bacterial hydrase has a molecular weight of 158,000 ± 3,000 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium. In contrast, the enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 43,000 in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in either the presence or absence of reducing agent. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate yields a molecular weight of 40,000, also about one-fourth that of the native enzyme. Unlike bovine liver crotonase, the bacterial enzyme is specific for short chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates and is sensitive to high concentrations of crotonyl-CoA. It requires a complete coenzyme A thioester substrate for efficient catalysis. It is concluded that crotonase from C. acetobutylicum is composed of 4 subunit polypeptide chains, with each chain containing about 370 residues devoid of any attached carbohydrate, and that the 4 subunits of the native enzyme are combined through noncovalent interactions. There are, however, a number of similarities between the bacterial and mammalian enzymes, which suggest that the two may be structurally related."

https://openalex.org/W1571337435,"Abstract High solubility human fibrinogens isolated from plasma (Fractions I-8 and I-9) or from plasmin digests of fibrinogen in vitro (Fractions I-8D and I-9D) were found to have substantially reduced cross-linking capacity. Under conditions in which Fraction I-4 formed 6 moles of e-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-link per mole of fibrin, the high solubility fibrinogens formed approximately three. Since polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate showed that cross-linking of the γ chains was complete, it was concluded that the Aα chains of high solubility fibrinogens lack an average of two to three cross-linking sites. This finding, plus the fact that the Aα chains of the high solubility fibrinogens have undergone COOH-terminal degradation, permitted the conclusion that the Aα chain of fibrinogen contains cross-linking sites in its COOH-terminal region. Studies involving identification of monomeric α chain remnants in the electrophoretic patterns of fibrin from high solubility fibrinogens suggested that the NH2-terminal half of the Aα chain may also contain a cross-linking site (or sites), utilization of which depends on sites in the COOH-terminal region of Aα chains of neighboring molecules."

This lower rate, which becomes irreversible after a few minutes, remains linear for up to 75 min. The soluble protein made at 45° is hemoglobin. Synthesis occurs on small polysomes carrying only two or three ribosomes, but actidione or starvation for amino acids can preserve the normal polysome profile. The increased translation time at 45° is too fast to measure by our technique."
https://openalex.org/W2075471101,"The crystal and molecular structure of the thyroid hormone L-triiodothyronine has been determined by x-ray diffraction. The two phenyl rings are almost perpendicular to each other, the acute angle between their normals being 82 degrees. The 3′-iodine is situated proximal to the α-ring, rather than distal as inferred from chemical studies. Theoretical calculations indicate this proximal conformation to be energetically favored over the distal one."
https://openalex.org/W1511019847,"Abstract A single intraperitoneal injection of the carcinogenic arylhydroxamic acid N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide given to male rats inhibited the two RNA polymerase activities of isolated liver nuclei by as much as 80%. Low doses of the carcinogen inhibited the Mg2+-dependent polymerase activity preferentially; high doses inhibited the Mn2+ + (NH4)2SO4-dependent activity to a greater extent. Inhibition was detectable 15 min after injection of the compound and was maximal in 1 hour. Several related noncarcinogenic compounds and carcinogenic arylhydroxamic acids which were inactive toward the liver completely lacked the inhibitory effect shown by N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide. Female rats, which develop few liver tumors on administration of N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide, were refractory to the inhibition of liver RNA polymerase by this compound. The depression of RNA synthesis by N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide was not due to decreased permeability of the nuclear membrane to substrates, nor to increased hydrolysis of newly synthesized RNA. Similar types of RNA were made in the control and treated rats, and the template capacities of liver chromatin and DNA were not affected by the carcinogen. These data suggest that the inhibition of RNA synthesis by N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide is due to inactivation of the RNA polymerases and not to decreased availability of DNA for transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1601004986,"Abstract On the hypothesis that bacterial luciferase may be classed as a mixed function oxidase, compounds reported to be specific inhibitors for such enzymes were tested. Inhibitors designated as SKF (2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenyl valerate), DPDA (N,N-diethyl-2,4-dichloro(6-phenylphenoxy)-ethylamine), and DPEA (2,3-dichloro(6-phenylphenoxy)ethylamine) were effective in blocking the in vitro reaction of pure luciferase at inhibitor concentrations between 10-5 and 10-4 m. The mode of action of the two different types of compounds has been found to be distinctly different. One (SKF) interferes with the reaction of one of the substrates, namely FMNH2, while the other (DPEA) blocks the site for aldehyde, the second substrate. Both compounds are effective inhibitors of bacterial growth and luminescence, affecting both functions in similar although not identical degrees."
https://openalex.org/W1553030674,"Abstract Four monosaccharide glycosyltransferases have been found to be present in particles prepared from normal canine respiratory tissue, and this report describes some of their properties. One is a sialyltransferase which catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid from cytidine monophosphate N-acetyl-neuraminic acid to glycoproteins containing N-acetylgalactosamine as terminal residues. Another transferase found in these particles catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from its uridine diphosphate derivative to fetuin from which sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine had been removed. Several other glycoproteins were tested for acceptor activity and all were negative which shows the high specificity of this hexosaminyltransferase. This particulate preparation also catalyzed the transfer of fucosyl units from its sugar nucleotide to fetuin sequentially treated with sialidase and galactosidase. The fourth transferase, an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine from its uridine diphosphate derivative to a polypeptide prepared by treating ovine submaxillary mucin with sialidase and N-acetylgalactosaminidase. Porcine submaxillary mucin, free of the terminal N-acetyl-galactosamine residues, was also an acceptor for the latter sugar nucleotide which suggests the presence of a second N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase in the particles. The presence of the latter enzyme infers that respiratory mucins contain the blood type A structural determinant. Enzymatic activities were stimulated by Triton X-100 and, except for the sialyltransferase by Mn2+. Maximum incorporation occurred at near neutral or slightly acidic pH, and the Km values for the substrates were found to be approximately 10-3 m. The activities of the transferases were inhibited by nucleotides and at moderate or high ionic strengths."

The codon recognition properties of these isoacceptors were studied in hemoglobin synthesis in a cell-free systemn. The two isoacceptors transferred lysine into different sites in hemoglobin, but showed no preference for one chain over the other. Codon cross recognition was less than 4 percent."
https://openalex.org/W1547256706,"Abstract Evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of intact rabbit heart mitochondria may be regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism. Mitochondria incubated in the presence of pyruvate plus l-malate and either ADP or uncoupler exhibit nearly identical, rapid rates of pyruvate oxidation but possess markedly different ATP levels. It was shown that under metabolic conditions which lead to a release or mobilization of intramitochondrial magnesium and which also have a high intramitochondrial ATP level, pyruvate oxidation was nearly completely inhibited after a brief lag phase. It was shown that the addition of exogenous magnesium to uncoupled mitochondria supplemented with ADP caused a more rapid inhibition of pyruvate oxidation. The observed inhibition of pyruvate oxidation was dependent upon the time of preliminary incubation with uncoupler and ADP and was atractyloside-sensitive. Evidence was obtained indicating that the inhibition of pyruvate oxidation was specific for the substrate, pyruvate, i.e. the oxidation of l(-)palmitylcarnitine or α-ketoglutarate was unaffected under conditions leading to an inhibition of pyruvate oxidation. In addition, it was demonstrated that the inhibition of pyruvate oxidation was not caused by an accumulation of either NADH or acetyl-CoA, both inhibitory products of the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, during the course of these experiments. The experiments reported in this communication indicate that the control of the availability of both ATP and magnesium are crucial for the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. These studies are consistent with the possibility that the pyruvate dehydrogenase-linked protein kinase may be an effective means of regulating the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in intact metabolic systems such as the isolated mitochondrion."

The utilization of galactose in both normal and galactosemic cells was strongly inhibited by glucose at physiologic concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1532693516,"Abstract The cotton carboxypeptidase hydrolyzes several ester substrates, small polypeptides, and denatured proteins. It does not hydrolyze dipeptides and hydrolyzes tripeptides very slowly. It appears to hydrolyze any amino acid from the COOH-terminal of polypeptides, including proline. Its activity against esters and peptides is not inhibited by sulfhydryl antagonists, and no requirement for metal ions has been demonstrated. Its esterase and carboxypeptidase activities are inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, and phosphoserine can be isolated from the diisopropylfluorophosphate-inhibited enzyme after mild acid hydrolysis, indicating that the enzyme employs a protease type of hydrolytic mechanism. Two molecules of diisopropylfluorophosphate must react with a molecule of native enzyme to completely inhibit its activity. When the enzyme is inhibited with radioactive diisopropylfluorophosphate, the two large polypeptide chains of the enzyme incorporate radioactivity. Thus, two active sites, each on a separate chain, are indicated for the enzyme. Chymotrypsin digestion of the enzyme inhibited with radioactive diisopropylfluorophosphate yields a single radioactive peptide, indicating that the sequence of amino acids around the active site serine of each subunit is identical."
https://openalex.org/W2082357531,"The activity of-phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in mice of the C57Bl/Ka strain was determined after a 4 degrees C stress. The enzyme activity increased 1.2-fold at the end of 3 hours and by 1.4-fold by the end of 6 hours of the stress. The results are in contrast to those from other species with intact animals in which the enzyme changes only after several days of chronic stress. Cycloheximide prevents the rise in enzyme activity, suggesting the increase may be due to protein synthesis. The increase may provide a model system for studying regulation of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1602026554,"Abstract [1α-2H]- and [1α,2α-2H2]5β-pregnane-3,11,20-trione were prepared from 1α,2α-dideuteriopregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. The C-1,2 dehydrogenation of 5β-pregnane-3,11,20-trione by Δ1-dehydrogenase from Septomyxa affinis was found to proceed by a stereospecific removal of the diequatorially oriented 1α and 2β hydrogens. A mechanism involving loss of the 2β proton by enolization followed by loss of the 1α proton and electron transfer to the C-1,2 position has been proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1599318842,"Abstract The metabolism of dihydrometanicotine was investigated in the rat and dog. In preliminary studies, dihydrometanicotine difumarate was administered to rats. The Rf values and retention times of methyl esters prepared from acidic Koenig-positive metabolites in the urine suggested the presence of 3-pyridylacetate and 4-(3-pyridyl)butyrate. Following administration of dihydrometanicotine difumarate to dogs, the pattern of excretion of acidic metabolites in the urine was similar to that found in the rat. Chemical conversion of the acidic metabolites to their methyl esters for separation by preparative gas chromatography afforded methyl 3-pyridylacetate and methyl 4-(3-pyridyl)butyrate. Methyl 3-pyridylacetate was identified by melting point, elemental analysis, and the infrared spectrum of its picric acid salt. Methyl 4-(3-pyridyl)butyrate was identified by mass spectroscopy and by the melting point, elemental analysis, and the infrared spectrum of the methyl ester picrate. Previous studies have provided evidence for the formation of 3-pyridylacetate from (-)nicotine via either (-)cotinine or (-)demethylcotinine. In view of the report (de Clercq, M., and Truhaut, R. (1962) Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol., 44, 227) that dihydrometanicotine is a metabolite of nicotine in the rat, the present findings in the rat and dog suggest a third alternate route (via dihydrometanicotine) to 3-pyridylacetate."
