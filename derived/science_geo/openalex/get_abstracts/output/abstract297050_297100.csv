https://openalex.org/W2024462250,"A new allotropic form of carbon occurs in shock-fused graphite gneisses in the Ries Crater, Bavaria. The assemblage in which it occurs consists of hexagonal graphite, rutile, pseudobrookite, magnetite, nickeliferous pyrrhotite, and baddeleyite. Electron-probe analyses indicate that the new phase is pure carbon. It is opaque and much more strongly reflecting than hexagonal graphite. Measurement of x-ray diffraction powder patterns leads to cell dimensions a = 8.948 +/- 0.009, c = 14.078 +/- 0.017 angstroms, with a primitive hexagonal lattice."

Neutron-activation analysis of these elements, as well as of sodium and iron, provides a means of identifying the geologic source of an archeological artifact of obsidian."

The two processes do not show the same kinetics. 5-Fluorodeoxyuridine inhibits chlorophyll synthesis during the normal course of ""greening"" by inhibiting chloroplast growth. This compound also inhibits cytokinin-induced chloroplast replication."
https://openalex.org/W2120650501,"Sorted stripes, nets, and polygons in the Appalachians of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia display patterns and stone orientations visibly similar to those of ground patterned under current cold climates. Larger forms appear inactive or fossil and may provide data on the paleoclimate and slope stability."
https://openalex.org/W2005889341,"The presence of abundant limonite on Mars has long been the subject of controversy. Some advocates of abundant limonite also suggest that the albedo differences between Martian light and dark areas are caused by different sizes of particles in those areas. We show that the relative albedo is reversed from the blue to the red for samples of limonite with particles of different sizes. Observations of Mars reveal no blue-red albedo reversal between the light and dark areas. Consequently, the hypothesis of particle size control of albedo is incompatible with the presence of abundant limonite on Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2046059226,"Five zircon samples from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina yield discordant uranium-lead ages which suggest an original age of 820 million years and an episodic lead loss at 240 million years. The indicated age of lead loss is interpreted as the age of movement of the Blue Ridge thrust sheet."

https://openalex.org/W2030781119,"Organic combustion products generated by the lunar module descent engine, which burns a 1:1 mixture of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer, have been analyzed. The major gaseous combustion products found were ammonia, water, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitric oxide. The minor products were acetylene, hydrogen cyanide, ethylene, formaldehyde, propadiene, ketene, cyanous acid, hydrazoic acid, various methylamines, acetaldehyde, methyl nitrite, formic acid, nitrous acid, butadiyne, nitrilohydrazines, nitromethane, and nitrosohydrazines with other oxidized derivatives of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and hydrazine. The ion intensities of the various species in all mass spectra were estimated as the following concentrations: the gases (NH(3), H(2)O, CO, NO, O(2), CO(2), and NO(2)), 87.7 percent; compounds of C, H, and O, 6.0 percent; and compounds of C, H, and N (with traces of O), 5.8 percent."

Lithified-nonlithified couplets can now be related in age and orientation. Age determinations based on the method of carbon-14 dating show that adjacent nonlithified-lithified layers may differ in age by more than 30,000 years."

https://openalex.org/W2015671757,"Paleosalinity values in certain rocks determined by the sedimentary phosphate method differ from salinity estimates based upon contained fossil assemblages, geochemical methods, and existing stratigraphic controls. Some anomalous values are related to the abundance of fossil organisms known to be concentrators of calcium phosphate. Because of the abundance and diversity of organisms which might introduce significant errors into paleosalinity estimates, the sedimentary phosphate method seemingly is of limited applicability."

The balloons, flown at altitudes of 20 and 24 kilometers, will make possible a detailed analysis of the stratospheric circulation near the equator and will hopefully lead to an understanding of the quasi-biennial stratospheric oscillation in the tropics."
