https://openalex.org/W2258573009,"While alternative splicing is known to diversify the functional characteristics of some genes, the extent to which protein isoforms globally contribute to functional complexity on a proteomic scale remains unknown. To address this systematically, we cloned full-length open reading frames of alternatively spliced transcripts for a large number of human genes and used protein-protein interaction profiling to functionally compare hundreds of protein isoform pairs. The majority of isoform pairs share less than 50% of their interactions. In the global context of interactome network maps, alternative isoforms tend to behave like distinct proteins rather than minor variants of each other. Interaction partners specific to alternative isoforms tend to be expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner and belong to distinct functional modules. Our strategy, applicable to other functional characteristics, reveals a widespread expansion of protein interaction capabilities through alternative splicing and suggests that many alternative ""isoforms"" are functionally divergent (i.e., ""functional alloforms"")."

The establishment and maintenance of social bonds is crucial for survival of a social species. A social group offers safety and security, supports offspring survival, reduces the need for energy expenditure, and provides a stage for social reward (Eisenberger, 2012Eisenberger N.I. The pain of social disconnection: examining the shared neural underpinnings of physical and social pain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The motivation to initiate and maintain social bonds may be rooted in emotional states of either positive or negative valence. Social interactions can be rewarding and thereby recruit components of the brain’s reward circuitry, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Dölen et al., 2013Dölen G.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10477-10486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the absence of social contact also triggers a strong desire to seek social interaction. Social isolation, social exclusion, or feelings of social disconnection can lead to loneliness, which is a strongly aversive emotional state in humans and detrimental to physical and mental well-being (Cacioppo et al., 2006Cacioppo J.T. Hughes M.E. Waite L.J. Hawkley L.C. Thisted R.A. Loneliness as a specific risk factor for depressive symptoms: cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.Psychol.

Social relationships and health.Science. 1988; 241: 540-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aversive nature of this state is emphasized by the controversial use of solitary confinement as a form of punishment (Browne et al., 2011Browne A. Cambier A. Agha S.

Therefore, the negative state of isolation can trigger the motivation to seek and engage in social contact (Baumeister and Leary, 1995Baumeister R.F. Leary M.R.

Soc. Clin. Psychol. 1990; 9: 196-201Crossref Google Scholar). Social isolation is also aversive to rodents. Rodents are innately social creatures and prefer social rather than isolate housing (Loo et al., 2001Loo P.L.P.V. de Groot A.C. Zutphen B.F.M.V. Baumans V. Do Male Mice Prefer or Avoid Each Other’s Company? Influence of Hierarchy, Kinship, and Familiarity.J. Appl. Anim. Welf. Sci. 2001; 4: 91-103Crossref Google Scholar). Even an acute period of isolation in rodents increases motivation to seek out and engage with conspecifics (Niesink and van Ree, 1982Niesink R.J. van Ree J.M.

Given that the mesolimbic DA system has been implicated in social behavior (Gunaydin et al., 2014Gunaydin L.A. Grosenick L. Finkelstein J.C. Kauvar I.V. Fenno L.E. Adhikari A. Lammel S.

Behav. 1998; 59: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we initially considered VTA DA neurons as a candidate neural substrate for social isolation. However, since optogenetic activation of VTA DA neurons increases social interaction (Gunaydin et al., 2014Gunaydin L.A. Grosenick L. Finkelstein J.C. Kauvar I.V. Fenno L.E. Adhikari A. Lammel S.

Zhang F. Adamantidis A. Stuber G.D. Bonci A. de Lecea L. Deisseroth K.

Given that DA neurons are functionally heterogeneous (Brischoux et al., 2009Brischoux F. Chakraborty S. Brierley D.I.

Input-specific control of reward and aversion in the ventral tegmental area.Nature. 2012; 491: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), we investigated a relatively neglected subpopulation of DA neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Amid the sparse existing knowledge of the functional role of DRN DA neurons, optical stimulation of these neurons does not support intra-cranial self-stimulation (ICSS) (McDevitt et al., 2014McDevitt R.A. Tiran-Cappello A. Shen H. Balderas I. Britt J.P. Marino R.A.M. Chung S.L. Richie C.T. Harvey B.K. Bonci A. Serotonergic versus nonserotonergic dorsal raphe projection neurons: differential participation in reward circuitry.Cell Rep. 2014; 8: 1857-1869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), in contrast to the VTA (Witten et al., 2011Witten I.B. Steinberg E.E. Lee S.Y. Davidson T.J. Zalocusky K.A. Brodsky M. Yizhar O. Cho S.L. Gong S. Ramakrishnan C. et al.Recombinase-driver rat lines: tools, techniques, and optogenetic application to dopamine-mediated reinforcement.Neuron. 2011; 72: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), suggesting that DRN and VTA DA neurons may be functionally distinct. Here, we investigated the functional role of DRN DA neurons, which we found to possess the properties expected of a neural substrate for a “loneliness-like” state. Specifically, the strength of excitatory inputs onto DRN DA neurons and their naturally occurring activity in vivo were sensitive to social isolation. Optical activation of these neurons recapitulated a loneliness-like state, while optical inhibition prevented the sociability typically observed following a period of isolation. Furthermore, the magnitude of these effects was predicted by an individual’s social rank, which indicates the importance of prior social experience in determining the behavioral effect governed by these neurons. Taken together, we propose that DRN DA neurons represent a neural substrate for the subjective experience of social isolation and serve to promote a response to alleviate this aversive state. In order to probe the effect of social isolation on glutamatergic synaptic strength, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in brain slices prepared from male mice expressing GFP in DA neurons (Figures S1A–S1E; Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and measured the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) ratio. Glutamatergic synapses onto VTA DA neurons undergo rapid changes in synaptic strength within 24 hr of an acute appetitive (Ungless et al., 2001Ungless M.A. Whistler J.L. Malenka R.C. Bonci A. Single cocaine exposure in vivo induces long-term potentiation in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2001; 411: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) or aversive experience (Lammel et al., 2011Lammel S.

We therefore considered whether 24 hr of social isolation could induce potentiation at these synapses. However, we did not detect a difference in AMPAR/NMDAR ratio between group-housed and socially isolated mice in VTA DA neurons (Figure 1A).Figure 124 Hours of Social Isolation Induces Synaptic Potentiation onto DRN DA NeuronsShow full caption(A) AMPAR/NMDAR ratios recorded from VTA DA neurons in mice socially isolated for 24 hr (n = 12) were not significantly different from group-housed mice (n = 8; unpaired t test: t18 = 0.73, p = 0.47).(B) Low- (upper panel) and high-magnification (lower panels) confocal images of the DRN from a TH-GFP mouse showing GFP-expressing (green) and post hoc immunohistochemically verified TH-expressing (red) DA neurons with white arrows indicating co-labeled neurons.(C) AMPAR/NMDAR ratios recorded from DRN DA neurons in mice socially isolated for 24 hr, either in a familiar cage or a novel cage (familiar isolated or novel isolated, respectively), were significantly greater than group-housed mice in familiar or novel cages (one-way ANOVA: F3,47 = 5.910, ∗∗p = 0.0017; Newman-Keuls post hoc tests: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01; n = 19 naive, 17 familiar isolated, 9 novel grouped, and 6 novel isolated).

(F) Proposed model of AMPARs at synapses onto DRN DA neurons in group-housed mice and following social isolation. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. See also Figure S1. Among the relatively unexplored subpopulations of DAergic neurons residing outside of the VTA, an intriguing group lies within the DRN (Figure 1B) (Hökfelt et al., 1976Hökfelt T. Johansson O. Fuxe K. Goldstein M. Park D. Immunohistochemical studies on the localization and distribution of monoamine neuron systems in the rat brain. I. Tyrosine hydroxylase in the mes- and diencephalon.Med. Biol. 1976; 54: 427-453PubMed Google Scholar), which is highly conserved across species (Saper and Petito, 1982Saper C.B. Petito C.K. Correspondence of melanin-pigmented neurons in human brain with A1-A14 catecholamine cell groups.Brain. 1982; 105: 87-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, DRN DA neurons in mice that were socially isolated for 24 hr exhibited a significantly greater AMPAR/NMDAR ratio than group-housed, naive mice (Figure 1C). In order to confirm this effect was related to the experience of social isolation, rather than a nonspecific salient environmental manipulation, we also examined movement into a new cage. We found that transfer into a new cage as a group had no detectable effect on AMPAR/NMDAR ratio, but social isolation in a new cage also increased the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (Figure 1C). To examine the mechanism of social isolation-induced plasticity in DRN DA neurons, we used additional electrophysiological measures. Postsynaptically, AMPAR subunit composition can influence neuron excitability and synaptic efficacy (Liu and Zukin, 2007Liu S.J. Zukin R.S. Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors in synaptic plasticity and neuronal death.Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 126-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In contrast to GluR2-containing AMPARs, GluR2-lacking receptors are Ca2+-permeable and exhibit higher single-channel conductance (Hollmann et al., 1991Hollmann M. Hartley M. Heinemann S. Ca2+ permeability of KA-AMPA--gated glutamate receptor channels depends on subunit composition.Science. 1991; 252: 851-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Swanson et al., 1997Swanson G.T. Kamboj S.K. Cull-Candy S.G. Single-channel properties of recombinant AMPA receptors depend on RNA editing, splice variation, and subunit composition.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 58-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the rectification index (RI) of the AMPAR current was significantly greater in socially isolated mice (Figure 1D), suggesting an increase in GluR2-lacking AMPARs, which exhibit a characteristic inwardly rectifying current at positive potentials (Bellone and Lüscher, 2006Bellone C. Lüscher C. Cocaine triggered AMPA receptor redistribution is reversed in vivo by mGluR-dependent long-term depression.Nat.

Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors in synaptic plasticity and neuronal death.Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 126-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). At resting membrane potentials, the polyamine spermine can partially block GluR2-lacking AMPARs (Bowie and Mayer, 1995Bowie D. Mayer M.L. Inward rectification of both AMPA and kainate subtype glutamate receptors generated by polyamine-mediated ion channel block.Neuron. 1995; 15: 453-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), but opening of the receptor temporarily relieves this blockade, which results in a greater response to subsequent stimulation (Rozov and Burnashev, 1999Rozov A. Burnashev N. Polyamine-dependent facilitation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors counteracts paired-pulse depression.Nature. 1999; 401: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This therefore promotes paired-pulse facilitation at GluR2-lacking synapses (Liu and Zukin, 2007Liu S.J. Zukin R.S. Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors in synaptic plasticity and neuronal death.Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 126-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) in the presence of spermine was greater in socially isolated mice (Figures S1F and S1G). Contrastingly, we did not detect a significant difference in decay time constant of the NMDAR current between group-housed and socially-isolated mice (Figure S1H). Finally, to confirm an increase in GluR2-lacking AMPARs at these synapses, we applied 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine (NASPM, a selective blocker of GluR2-lacking AMPARs) to brain slices prepared from group-housed or socially isolated mice. This reduced the amplitude of the evoked AMPAR current recorded in DRN DA neurons from socially isolated, but not group-housed, mice (Figure 1E). Taken together, this suggests that social isolation induces a relative increase in GluR2-lacking AMPARs at glutamatergic synapses onto DRN DA neurons (Figure 1F). We next considered whether acute social isolation affected the naturally occurring activity within DRN DA neurons. To address this question, we utilized a genetically encodable fluorescent calcium indicator, GCaMP6m (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A.

Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M.

We targeted expression of GCaMP6m to DRN DA neurons by injection of an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV5) carrying GCaMP6m (AAV5-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6m) into the DRN of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)::IRES-Cre mice, which facilitated GCaMP6m expression in a Cre-dependent manner. An optic fiber implanted over the DRN allowed simultaneous delivery of 473 nm excitation light and collection of GCaMP6m emission by means of a dichroic and a photodetector (Figures 2A, 2B , and S2A).Figure S2Placement of Optic Fiber in the DRN for Photometry Recordings and Immunohistochemical Characterization of ChR2-eYFP Expression in TH::Cre and DAT::Cre Mice, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) The position of the tip of the optic fiber (blue cross) in the DRN of TH::Cre mice expressing GCaMP6m used for photometry recordings.(B) TH::Cre and (C) DAT::Cre mice received an injection of AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the DRN and coronal brain sections were prepared after at least 4 weeks of expression.(D) High-magnification confocal images of eYFP+ neurons, within one anterior and one posterior section of the DRN, showing co-expression of eYFP with TH (red) but not 5-HT (cyan) in a TH::Cre and (E) a DAT::Cre mouse.

To assess the effect of a social target on DRN DA activity, mice were recorded in their home cage during the introduction of a novel juvenile mouse. We compared the fluorescence signal, in response to initial contact with the juvenile mouse, in mice that had either been previously group-housed or socially isolated for 24 hr. Strikingly, in socially isolated mice, we observed a significant increase in the fluorescence signal in response to first contact with the juvenile mouse, compared with group-housed mice (Figures 2C–2F; Movie S1). Furthermore, in isolated mice, the activity in response to initial social contact was significantly greater than in response to initial interaction with a novel object (Figures 2C–2F). This suggests that, following social isolation, the presence of a social stimulus is associated with a significant increase in DRN DA activity in vivo. This is consistent with our finding that synaptic inputs onto DRN DA neurons are potentiated following social isolation. We next sought to characterize the neurotransmitter content of DRN DA neurons, establish their sites of release, and validate parameters for subsequent causal experimentation. The TH+ DRN neurons have been confirmed as DAergic as they express aromatic L-amino decarboxylase (AADC), the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, the product of TH, to DA (Lu et al., 2006Lu J. Jhou T.C. Saper C.B. Identification of wake-active dopaminergic neurons in the ventral periaqueductal gray matter.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and the DA transporter (DAT) (Dougalis et al., 2012Dougalis A.G. Matthews G.A.C. Bishop M.W. Brischoux F. Kobayashi K. Ungless M.A. Functional properties of dopamine neurons and co-expression of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the dorsal raphe nucleus and ventro-lateral periaqueductal grey.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2012; 36: 3322-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DRN TH+ neurons lack dopamine-β-hydroxylase, which is necessary to convert DA to norepinephrine (Nagatsu et al., 1979Nagatsu I. Inagaki S. Kondo Y. Karasawa N. Nagatsu T. Immunofluorescent studies on the localization of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase in the mes-, di-, and telencephalon of the rat using unperfused fresh frozen sections.Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1979; 12: 20-37Crossref Google Scholar), and do not express 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (Stratford and Wirtshafter, 1990Stratford T.R. Wirtshafter D. Ascending dopaminergic projections from the dorsal raphe nucleus in the rat.Brain Res. 1990; 511: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Still, it remained to be demonstrated where these neurons synapse, which neurotransmitters they release, and whether their activation is sufficient to elicit detectable neurotransmitter release in vivo. To address these questions, we expressed Channelrhodopsin-2 fused to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (ChR2-eYFP) in the DRN in a Cre-dependent manner (Figures 3A and 3B ). In TH::Cre mice we found that 77.7% of eYFP+ neurons co-labeled with TH using immunohistochemistry (Figures S2B, S2D, and S2F). This is consistent with a previous study (McDevitt et al., 2014McDevitt R.A. Tiran-Cappello A. Shen H. Balderas I. Britt J.P. Marino R.A.M. Chung S.L. Richie C.T. Harvey B.K. Bonci A.

Evolutionarily conserved DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways are required for maintenance of genome stability in mammalian cells (Lieber, 2010Lieber M.R. The mechanism of double-strand DNA break repair by the nonhomologous DNA end-joining pathway.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 181-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Classical non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) is a critical somatic cell DSB repair pathway that is not dependent on sequence homology and that functions throughout the cell cycle (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L. Guo C. Schwer B. Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Evolutionarily conserved core C-NHEJ proteins include XRCC4 and DNA Ligase 4 (Lig4), which form an end ligation complex (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L. Guo C. Schwer B. Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Boboila et al., 2012Boboila C. Alt F.W. Schwer B. Classical and alternative end-joining pathways for repair of lymphocyte-specific and general DNA double-strand breaks.Adv. Immunol. 2012; 116: 1-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). C-NHEJ to a degree relies on DSB detection by the Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) DNA damage response protein (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L. Guo C. Schwer B. Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Deficiency for C-NHEJ factors, or ATM and its downstream factors, leads to persistence of DSBs and their more frequent joining to other DSBs to generate chromosomal rearrangements, including translocations, deletions, inversions, and amplifications (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W.

Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Gapud and Sleckman, 2011Gapud E.J. Sleckman B.P. Unique and redundant functions of ATM and DNA-PKcs during V(D)J recombination.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 1928-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the absence of C-NHEJ, such chromosomal rearrangements employ an alternative end-joining (A-EJ) pathway (Boboila et al., 2012Boboila C. Alt F.W. Schwer B. Classical and alternative end-joining pathways for repair of lymphocyte-specific and general DNA double-strand breaks.Adv. Immunol. 2012; 116: 1-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). C-NHEJ DSB repair is required for both immune and nervous system development (Gao et al., 1998Gao Y. Sun Y. Frank K.M. Dikkes P. Fujiwara Y. Seidl K.J. Sekiguchi J.M. Rathbun G.A. Swat W. Wang J. et al.A critical role for DNA end-joining proteins in both lymphogenesis and neurogenesis.Cell. 1998; 95: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Xrcc4 or Lig4 in the mouse germline blocks lymphocyte development, owing to the requirement for C-NHEJ to join antigen receptor variable region gene segments during V(D)J recombination (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L. Guo C. Schwer B. Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Xrcc4 or Lig4 inactivation also severely impairs neural development, leading to widespread apoptotic death of early post-mitotic neurons and associated late embryonic lethality (Barnes et al., 1998Barnes D.E. Stamp G. Rosewell I. Denzel A. Lindahl T. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DNA ligase IV leads to lethality in embryonic mice.Curr.

DNA ligase IV deficiency in mice leads to defective neurogenesis and embryonic lethality via the p53 pathway.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 993-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neuronal loss and embryonic lethality in C-NHEJ-deficient mice are rescued by p53 deficiency, indicating that both result from a p53-dependent checkpoint response to unrepaired DSBs (Frank et al., 2000Frank K.M. Sharpless N.E. Gao Y. Sekiguchi J.M. Ferguson D.O. Zhu C. Manis J.P. Horner J. DePinho R.A. Alt F.W.

However, V(D)J recombination and, correspondingly, B cell development are not rescued in C-NHEJ/p53 double-deficient mice, which routinely develop lethal progenitor B cell lymphomas with clonal translocations and amplifications involving fusion of V(D)J recombination-associated DSBs in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) and c-myc oncogene loci via A-EJ (Difilippantonio et al., 2002Difilippantonio M.J.

Notably, C-NHEJ/p53 double-deficient mice also develop medulloblastomas (MBs) in situ (Lee and McKinnon, 2002Lee Y. McKinnon P.J. DNA ligase IV suppresses medulloblastoma formation.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6395-6399PubMed Google Scholar, Zhu et al., 2002Zhu C. Mills K.D. Ferguson D.O. Lee C. Manis J. Fleming J. Gao Y. Morton C.C.

Unrepaired DNA breaks in p53-deficient cells lead to oncogenic gene amplification subsequent to translocations.Cell. 2002; 109: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Moreover, neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC)-specific inactivation of Xrcc4 in p53-deficient mice leads to MBs that harbor recurrent clonal translocations, amplifications, and deletions (Yan et al., 2006Yan C.T. Kaushal D. Murphy M. Zhang Y. Datta A. Chen C. Monroe B. Mostoslavsky G. Coakley K. Gao Y. et al.XRCC4 suppresses medulloblastomas with recurrent translocations in p53-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 7378-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Brain cells frequently contain somatic genomic variations, including deletions, and rearrangements, which in some cases are linked to retrotransposition (Erwin et al., 2014Erwin J.A. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Mobile DNA elements in the generation of diversity and complexity in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, McConnell et al., 2013McConnell M.J. Lindberg M.R. Brennand K.J. Piper J.C. Voet T. Cowing-Zitron C. Shumilina S. Lasken R.S.

Cai X. Walsh C.A. Somatic mutation, genomic variation, and neurological disease.Science. 2013; 341: 1237758Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In this regard, single-cell sequencing of human frontal cortex neurons revealed that up to 41% had at least one megabase-scale de novo copy number variation (CNV), most of which were deletions (McConnell et al., 2013McConnell M.J. Lindberg M.R. Brennand K.J. Piper J.C. Voet T. Cowing-Zitron C. Shumilina S. Lasken R.S. Vermeesch J.R. Hall I.M. Gage F.H. Mosaic copy number variation in human neurons.Science. 2013; 342: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Due to technical limitations of such analyses, the actual frequency of these CNVs might be even higher (Erwin et al., 2014Erwin J.A. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Mobile DNA elements in the generation of diversity and complexity in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Such somatic changes have been speculated to generate neuronal diversity and result in greater variance of cellular and organismal phenotypes (Erwin et al., 2014Erwin J.A. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Mobile DNA elements in the generation of diversity and complexity in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, Muotri and Gage, 2006Muotri A.R. Gage F.H. Generation of neuronal variability and complexity.Nature. 2006; 441: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In theory, genomic aberrations in NSPCs might be transmitted to daughter cells and, thereby, contribute to genomic mosaicism in individual neurons or glial cells, where they could influence aspects of normal or abnormal brain function (Poduri et al., 2013Poduri A. Evrony G.D. Cai X. Walsh C.A. Somatic mutation, genomic variation, and neurological disease.Science. 2013; 341: 1237758Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the potential impacts of such genomic alterations in neural cells awaits elucidation of the underlying mechanisms (Erwin et al., 2014Erwin J.A. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Mobile DNA elements in the generation of diversity and complexity in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, Poduri et al., 2013Poduri A. Evrony G.D. Cai X. Walsh C.A. Somatic mutation, genomic variation, and neurological disease.Science. 2013; 341: 1237758Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We have developed an unbiased high-throughput, genome-wide, translocation sequencing (HTGTS) approach to map, at nucleotide resolution, genome-wide DSBs based on their ability to translocate to endogenous or ectopic bait DSBs at a specific chromosomal location (Chiarle et al., 2011Chiarle R.

HTGTS and a related approach revealed that off-target (OT) activities of lymphocyte-specific antigen receptor gene diversification enzymes generate recurrent DSBs or DSB clusters across the genome of B lineage cells (Chiarle et al., 2011Chiarle R.

For both mouse and human cells, recurrent DSBs or classes of DSBs are evident in genome-wide translocation landscapes, regardless of chromosomal location. The ability of such clusters of DSBs across the genome to be revealed by HTGTS results from cellular heterogeneity in 3D genome organization (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L. Guo C.

In the absence of recurrent DSBs, proximity causes DSBs in cis along a given chromosome to preferentially join (Dong et al., 2015Dong J. Panchakshari R.A. Zhang T. Zhang Y. Hu J. Volpi S.A.

Within a cis chromosome, translocation frequency is further enhanced between sequences within topological domains or loops due to increased interaction or other processes (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W.

Together, these properties of chromosomal translocations allow the use of HTGTS as a remarkably sensitive DSB detection method. We now apply an enhanced linear amplification-mediated HTGTS approach (Frock et al., 2015Frock R.L. Hu J. Meyers R.M. Ho Y.J. Kii E. Alt F.W. Genome-wide detection of DNA double-stranded breaks induced by engineered nucleases.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) to map DSBs in NSPCs. These studies reveal a large set of recurrently broken genes and suggest potential mechanisms underlying their origin. For initial studies, we performed HTGTS on NSPCs isolated from mice deficient for XRCC4 and p53 (Xrcc4−/−p53−/− mice), since, based on our prior studies, we expected this background to be a rich source of NSPC DSBs (Gao et al., 1998Gao Y.

We used a Cas9:single-guide RNA (sgRNA) approach to generate an initial HTGTS bait DSB as we described for other studies (Dong et al., 2015Dong J. Panchakshari R.A. Zhang T. Zhang Y. Hu J. Volpi S.A. Meyers R.M. Ho Y.J. Du Z.

Chromosomal Loop Domains Direct the Recombination of Antigen Receptor Genes.Cell. 2015; 163: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Specifically, we designed an sgRNA (Chr12-sgRNA-1) that targets a Cas9:sgRNA-generated bait DSB to an intergenic region ∼52 kb telomeric of N-myc on chromosome (Chr) 12 (Figure 1A, top). The Chr12-sgRNA-1 was introduced into cultured NSPCs, which were then maintained for 4.5 days and harvested for HTGTS. We used a primer that allowed us to identify endogenous prey DSBs genome-wide that joined to centromeric broken ends of a Chr12-sgRNA-1-generated bait DSB (Figure 1A, top). In four separate experiments, we identified 32,144 independent HTGTS junctions. We visualized overall junction patterns along each individual chromosome via modified Circos plots (Frock et al., 2015Frock R.L. Hu J. Meyers R.M. Ho Y.J. Kii E. Alt F.W. Genome-wide detection of DNA double-stranded breaks induced by engineered nucleases.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) of the mouse genome separated into 2.5-Mb bins. These studies revealed that 61.4% (19,734) of HTGTS junctions mapped within 500 kb of the Chr12-sgRNA-1 target site, with the majority of these not representing translocations but rather representing rejoining of a given bait DSB following resection (Figure 1A; Figures S1A and S1B; Table S1; Chiarle et al., 2011Chiarle R.

After excluding the break site resections, a substantial fraction (∼8%) of the remaining Chr12 junctions involved prey DSBs spread over Chr12 (Figure 1A), a phenomenon resulting from joining of bait DSBs to widespread low-level DSBs in cis due to 3D spatial proximity (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W.

We estimated that the frequency of prey DSBs participating in such break site chromosome translocations in XRCC4-deficient NSPCs is, at a minimum, about eight per cell (Table S2). Indeed, the actual DSB frequency likely is much higher since most DSBs are rejoined locally and do not translocate (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L. Guo C. Schwer B. Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Beyond the break site junctions, the remainder of the 9,966 (31%) HTGTS junctions were distributed broadly throughout the genome (Table S1; Figure 1B; for convenience, bins with less than five junctions are not illustrated on Circos plots but examples are shown in Figure S1C). We used the spatial clustering approach for the identification of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-enriched regions (SICER) algorithm (Zang et al., 2009Zang C. Schones D.E. Zeng C. Cui K. Zhao K. Peng W. A clustering approach for identification of enriched domains from histone modification ChIP-Seq data.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1952-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) to perform an unbiased assay of the HTGTS library data with the goal of identifying significantly enriched junction clusters across the XRCC4-deficient NSPC genome (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This analysis revealed three recurrent translocation clusters; notably, two of these clusters were located specifically within the limbic system-associated membrane protein (Lsamp) gene on Chr16 and the neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (Npas3) gene on Chr12, while the other represented a Chr12-sgRNA-1 OT site on Chr12 (Figure 1). As the prey DSBs participating in recurrent translocations to Lsamp and Npas3 were spread broadly across these long genes (see below), we refer to them as recurrent DSB clusters (RDCs). Finally, we also found the same three enriched junction clusters by an independent custom model-based analysis of ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) (MACS)-based pipeline (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To elucidate potential underlying mechanisms, we examined HTGTS junctions between Chr12-sgRNA-1 bait DSBs and prey DSBs across the 2.2-Mb-long Lsamp gene in Xrcc4−/−p53−/− NSPCs. By convention, prey HTGTS junctions are denoted + if the prey is read from the junction in a centromere-to-telomere direction and – if in the opposite direction (Figure 2A, top; Chiarle et al., 2011Chiarle R.

Here, we show that ground-state ESCs express low Myc levels. Deletion of both c-myc and N-myc (dKO) or pharmacological inhibition of Myc activity strongly decreases transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis, leading to proliferation arrest. This process is reversible and occurs without affecting pluripotency, suggesting that Myc-depleted stem cells enter a state of dormancy similar to embryonic diapause. Indeed, c-Myc is depleted in diapaused blastocysts, and the differential expression signatures of dKO ESCs and diapaused epiblasts are remarkably similar. Following Myc inhibition, pre-implantation blastocysts enter biosynthetic dormancy but can progress through their normal developmental program after transfer into pseudo-pregnant recipients. Our study shows that Myc controls the biosynthetic machinery of stem cells without affecting their potency, thus regulating their entry and exit from the dormant state."

While the former has been studied extensively, to what extent translation occurs on monosomes and its importance for overall translational output remain controversial. Here, we used ribosome profiling to examine the translational status of 80S monosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the vast majority of 80S monosomes are elongating, not initiating. Further, most mRNAs exhibit some degree of monosome occupancy, with monosomes predominating on nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targets, upstream open reading frames (uORFs), canonical ORFs shorter than ∼590 nt, and ORFs for which the total time required to complete elongation is substantially shorter than that required for initiation. Importantly, mRNAs encoding low-abundance regulatory proteins tend to be enriched in the monosome fraction. Our data highlight the importance of monosomes for the translation of highly regulated mRNAs. Fully assembled ribosomes exist in two populations: polysomes and monosomes.

Importantly, mRNAs encoding low-abundance regulatory proteins tend to be enriched in the monosome fraction. Our data highlight the importance of monosomes for the translation of highly regulated mRNAs. The cytoplasm contains two populations of ribosomes: polysomes and monosomes. Polysomes consist of mRNAs occupied by two or more ribosomes, whereas monosomes are a mix of mRNAs bound by a single ribosome plus “vacant couples” wherein the large and small ribosomal subunits stably associate in the absence of mRNA (Noll et al., 1973Noll M. Hapke B. Schreier M.H. Noll H. Structural dynamics of bacterial ribosomes. I. Characterization of vacant couples and their relation to complexed ribosomes.J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 75: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Ample evidence from radioactive amino acid incorporation studies indicates that the vast majority of new peptide bonds are formed on polysomes (Warner and Knopf, 2002Warner J.R. Knopf P.M. The discovery of polyribosomes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 376-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Noll, 2008Noll H. The discovery of polyribosomes.BioEssays. 2008; 30: 1220-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thus, polysomes are generally equated with the translationally active mRNA pool, with monosomes often presumed to be newly assembled at the start codon and therefore translationally inactive (for examples, see Van Der Kelen et al., 2009Van Der Kelen K. Beyaert R. Inzé D. De Veylder L. Translational control of eukaryotic gene expression.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Extensive translation of small open reading frames revealed by poly-ribo-seq.eLife. 2014; 3: e03528Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, some fraction of monosomes must be translationally active. For example, the first or “pioneer” round of translation on any newly transcribed mRNA necessarily involves translation by a single ribosome until it has moved far enough to allow a second ribosome to assemble at the start codon. Further, the average distance between elongating ribosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been estimated to be >100 nt (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O.

USA. 2003; 100: 3889-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, Shah et al., 2013Shah P. Ding Y. Niemczyk M. Kudla G. Plotkin J.B. Rate-limiting steps in yeast protein translation.Cell. 2013; 153: 1589-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). With such spacing, some open reading frames (ORFs) (e.g., RPL41A and RPL41B, each 78 nt) are so short that they should be occupied by just one ribosome (Yu and Warner, 2001Yu X. Warner J.R. Expression of a micro-protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33821-33825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, S. cerevisiae mRNAs with very short ORFs cosediment predominantly with 80S monosomes (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O. Herschlag D. Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3889-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Notably, that study also revealed that several longer ORF mRNAs known to be translationally regulated (e.g., GCN4, CPA1, and ICY2) are primarily monosome associated. Ribosome profiling enables the precise mapping of ribosome positions on mRNAs undergoing active translation (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R.S. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar). Here, we adapted this protocol to specifically examine the translational status of 80S monosomes in S. cerevisiae. We provide definitive evidence that the vast majority of monosomes are in the act of elongation, not initiation. As expected, monosomes predominate on nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targets, including unspliced transcripts. Transcriptome-wide, relative polysome and monosome occupancy is a function of initiation versus total elongation time. That is, if initiation is faster than elongation, an mRNA will be predominantly polysome associated. Conversely, if initiation is much slower than elongation, an mRNA will be predominantly monosome associated. A high initiation:elongation ratio can be driven either by ORF length or by slow initiation rate, often indicative of translation regulation. Thus, in addition to synthesizing extremely short proteins, monosomes also translate key regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors, kinases, and phosphatases. Such regulatory factors are often transiently expressed (i.e., have short mRNA and protein half-lives) at very low levels. Therefore, relative monosome:polysome association may prove a useful metric for identifying and studying mRNAs subject to negative translation regulation. To generate monosome- and polysome-specific footprints, we took multiple precautions to ensure that the ribosome footprints we isolated accurately reflect intracellular conditions (Figure 1). To minimize ribosome movement during sample workup, we briefly incubated log phase cultures with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide prior to rapid collection by vacuum filtration and immediate resuspension in ice-cold lysis buffer and performed all subsequent steps at 4°C (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R.S. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar). To preserve polysome integrity, we lysed cells by vortexing with glass beads rather than ball milling, as ball milling tends to shear polysomes and thereby artificially increase the monosome fraction. We also excluded detergent (e.g., Triton X-100) as it led to excessive foaming and poor cell lysis. Because efficient extraction of membrane-bound polysomes requires detergent (Potter and Nicchitta, 2002Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. Endoplasmic reticulum-bound ribosomes reside in stable association with the translocon following termination of protein synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23314-23320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we expected cytoplasmic species to predominate in our lysates. Although Mg2+ concentrations up to 30 mM are often used when preparing yeast extract for polysome profiling (Bhattacharya et al., 2010Bhattacharya A. McIntosh K.B. Willis I.M. Warner J.R. Why Dom34 stimulates growth of cells with defects of 40S ribosomal subunit biosynthesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5562-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), [Mg2+] in excess of 8 mM can drive vacant couple formation (Favaudon and Pochon, 1976Favaudon V. Pochon F. Magnesium dependence of the association kinetics of Escherichia coli ribosomal subunits.Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3903-3912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, we limited total [Mg2+] to 5 mM in all experiments. For global ribosome profiling (Figure 1, left), cell lysates are digested with RNase I prior to ribosome isolation (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R.S. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar). Consequently, the entire ribosome population is sampled without regard to monosome or polysome status. To instead generate monosome- and polysome-specific footprints, we first separated the two populations on a 6%–38% (w/v) sucrose gradient. These gradients were centrifuged for a time sufficient to sediment the 80S monosome peak to the middle fractions, allowing both monosomes and polysomes to be collected with optimal separation between the two pools. These conditions also allowed for clean separation between monosomes and 48S initiation complexes that, although unlikely, could leave mRNA footprints upon RNase l digestion (Aspden et al., 2014Aspden J.L. Eyre-Walker Y.C. Phillips R.J. Amin U. Mumtaz M.A.S. Brocard M. Couso J.-P. Extensive translation of small open reading frames revealed by poly-ribo-seq.eLife. 2014; 3: e03528Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Ingolia et al., 2014Ingolia N.T. Brar G.A. Stern-Ginossar N. Harris M.S. Talhouarne G.J.S. Jackson S.E. Wills M.R. Weissman J.S. Ribosome profiling reveals pervasive translation outside of annotated protein-coding genes.Cell Rep. 2014; 8: 1365-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Pooled fractions were then separately digested with RNase I prior to loading on a second sucrose gradient (Figure 1, middle and right), ensuring that any mRNA fragments obtained were bona fide ribosome footprints and not similarly sized protected fragments originating from non-ribosome-bound positions on the intact monosome or polysome-bound mRNAs isolated from the first gradient. We also generated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries from total lysate RNA extracted prior to gradient fractionation. For both biological replicates of isolated monosomes and polysomes, ∼80%–90% of uniquely mapping reads post-ncRNA removal aligned to the sacCer3 genome (Table S1), with 5,045 of 6,692 annotated ORFs having at least ten reads in all four libraries. Scatterplots comparing either total ribosome occupancy per ORF (reads per million mapped; RPM) or ribosome density per ORF (reads per kilobase per million mapped; RPKM) revealed high correlations between biological replicates (Pearson coefficient > 0.99) (Figure S1). Thus, our monosome- and polysome-specific ribosome profiling data were highly reproducible and covered the vast majority (75%) of annotated ORFs. When aggregated across all coding sequence (CDS) genes, ribosome footprints tend to be highly enriched at ORF 5′ ends and then sharply decrease before reaching a plateau that persists throughout the remainder of the ORF (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R.S. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar). Both metagene and aggregation plots of our global ribosome footprints replicated these features (Figures 2A and 2B , left). Monosome and polysome plots, however, were distinctly different (Figures 2A and 2B, middle and right). Whereas both exhibited ORF 5′ end enrichment, this enrichment was much more pronounced for monosomes and much less pronounced for polysomes than the global pattern. Further, the plateau was lower for monosomes and higher for polysomes than the global plateau. Therefore, monosomes and polysomes make distinct contributions to the global ribosome footprint pattern. High monosome occupancy at ORF 5′ ends might suggest that a large fraction is in the process of initiation with tRNAmet in the P site. Because our double sedimentation strategy strongly disfavored free tRNA contamination in our footprinting libraries, any tRNA fragments in our libraries likely originated from stably bound tRNAs. In both monosome and polysome libraries, very similar fractions of tRNA-mapping reads (0.76%–1.03% Mono; 0.62%–1.08% Poly) corresponded to tRNAmet (Table S2), indicating there was no major difference in tRNAmet association between monosomes and polysomes. Further, only 7% of monosome 28-nt reads were positioned over canonical ORF start codons, compared to 2% for polysomes. All other 28-nt reads mapping to canonical ORFs (93% and 98%, respectively) mapped to internal codon positions, demonstrating that most monosomes are in the process of elongation. Further evidence for elongating monosomes came from aggregating 28-nt read 5′ end positions relative to the start codon. Both monosome and polysome footprints exhibited the 3-nt phasing characteristic of elongating ribosomes (Figure 2B, inset), and for both populations, this strong phasing continued all the way to the stop codon (Figure 2C, inset). Among all 6,692 annotated CDS genes, 5,029 (75%) had more than five 28-nt monosome footprints in each biological replicate indicative of elongation (i.e., P site inside the ORF). Thus, most monosomes (93%) were in the process of elongation, with most genes (75%) having multiple 28-nt monosome footprints within the ORF. We conclude that the preponderance of 80S monosomes in our samples were translationally active and that at least a fraction of elongation events on most mRNAs occurs while the mRNA is occupied by a single ribosome. A prominent difference between the monosome and polysome aggregation plots occurs across codons 9–36 (Figure 2B). Whereas monosome read coverage decreased ∼3-fold over this region (5′ ends at nucleotide positions +12 to +93), polysome read coverage remained relatively even. These same patterns were observed when aggregation plots were limited to cytoplasmic mRNAs (see below; Figures S2C–S2F). Likely explanations for these different patterns are discussed below. Another difference between the aggregation plots occurred at ORF 3′ ends, where monosome reads exhibited a slight uptick (∼1.5-fold) over the last 100 nt, while polysome reads did not (Figure 2C). This uptick in monosome reads was even more pronounced in aggregation plots limited to mRNAs that were otherwise polysome enriched (Figures S2G and S2H). This signal could originate from the final ribosome on an otherwise polysome-associated mRNA as that ribosome completes translation prior to or coincident with mRNA degradation (Pelechano et al., 2015Pelechano V. Wei W. Steinmetz L.M. Widespread co-translational RNA decay reveals ribosome dynamics.Cell. 2015; 161: 1400-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Features common to both monosome and polysome aggregation plots were (1) strong peaks at codons 1 and 5 (Figure 2B, labeled in right inset) and (2) a 4- rather than 3-nt gap between the last coding position peak and final peak over the stop codon (Figure 2C, inset). Because the +5 codon peak did not disappear when aggregation plots were normalized so that each gene contributed equally (Figures S2A and S2D), it was a general feature of our libraries and not due to any single gene or small gene subset. Thus, +5 pausing may be a general post-initiation feature in both yeast and mammals, where it was recently attributed to exit tunnel geometry (Han et al., 2014Han Y. Gao X. Liu B. Wan J. Zhang X. Qian S.-B. Ribosome profiling reveals sequence-independent post-initiation pausing as a signature of translation.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 842-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The offset peak at ORF 3′ ends was also apparent in normalized aggregation plots (Figures S2B and S2F), indicating its generality. This previously observed spacing (Guydosh and Green, 2014Guydosh N.R. Green R. Dom34 rescues ribosomes in 3′ untranslated regions.Cell. 2014; 156: 950-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) may be due to mRNA compaction during termination (Brown et al., 2015Brown A. Shao S. Murray J. Hegde R.S. Ramakrishnan V. Structural basis for stop codon recognition in eukaryotes.Nature. 2015; 524: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, with regard to these previously characterized features at the 5′ and 3′ ends of ORFs, we could detect no differences between the monosome and polysome populations. To determine if the transcriptome-wide patterns accurately represented footprint patterns across single genes, we next examined individual ORFs. As expected from the metagene and aggregation plots, monosome footprints on many ORFs predominated at and immediately downstream of the start codon, with polysome footprints exhibiting much higher coverage across the entire ORF (e.g., SHM2 and RHR2; Figures 2D and 2E). Other genes, however, exhibited very similar patterns between the monosome, polysome, and global libraries. Some such genes encoded long and abundant proteins (e.g., actin/ACT1 and RPL16B; Figures 2F and 2G). Hence, some mRNA molecules encoding even highly abundant housekeeping genes are apparently translated by monosomes. Next, we used the differential expression package DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014Love M.I. Huber W. Anders S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 550Crossref PubMed Scopus (32349) Google Scholar) to compute monosome versus polysome fold enrichment for each mRNA (monosome:polysome score). For cytoplasmic mRNAs, our data paralleled the previous microarray estimate of ribosome number per mRNA (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O. Herschlag D. Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3889-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), with monosome:polysome scores increasing as estimated ribosome number decreased (Figure S3A). This relationship did not exist, however, for membrane-associated mRNAs, which were highly skewed toward monosome occupancy (Figure S3B). For these mRNAs, monosome footprints accumulated over and immediately downstream of predicted signal sequences (Figures S3C and S3D). This fits the long-standing model of ER protein import (Figure S3E), where the signal sequence is first translated by a single cytoplasmic ribosome prior to signal recognition particle (SRP) recruitment and membrane engagement. Because membrane-associated polysomes were likely undersampled due to lack of detergent in our cell lysis procedure, we limited all subsequent analyses to the 4,342 mRNAs for which no evidence exists of membrane association (i.e., cytoplasmic mRNAs). A major determinant of ribosome number per mRNA is ORF length (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O. Herschlag D. Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3889-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a scatterplot of monosome:polysome score versus ORF length revealed a strong inverse relationship, with shorter ORFs being more monosome-associated than longer ORFs (Figure 3A). Mean and median monosome:polysome scores of ordered bins each containing 50 genes revealed this relationship to be particularly strong and nearly linear for ORFs ≤590 nts (Figures 3B and S3F). Thus, the shortest canonical ORFs in CDS genes tend to be occupied by a single ribosome. Besides short canonical ORFs, two other classes of short ORFs are sORFs (short <300 nt ORFs in transcripts not originally annotated as protein-coding genes [Smith et al., 2014Smith J.E. Alvarez-Dominguez J.R. Kline N. Huynh N.J. Geisler S. Hu W. Coller J. Baker K.E. Translation of small open reading frames within unannotated RNA transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar]) and uORFs (ORFs upstream of canonical ORFs [Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R.S. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar]). Both classes were strongly biased toward monosome occupancy (Figure 3C). Like short canonical ORFs, sORFs exhibited a negative correlation between ORF length and monosome:polysome read ratio; accordingly, sORFs are likely bona fide protein-coding genes translated predominantly by monosomes. Strikingly, a different behavior was observed for uORFs. Consistent with all currently annotated uORFs in non-membrane genes being <250 nt, the population as a whole was strongly biased toward monosome occupancy (Figure 3C). However, no relationship was detectable between monosome enrichment and uORF length. A likely explanation is that uORFs, by definition, are contained within multi-cistronic mRNAs whose cosedimentation with monosomes or polysomes is determined by the combined ribosome occupancy on all ORFs. Consequently, any simultaneous ribosome occupancy on multiple ORFs (even if each ORF is only occupied by a single ribosome) will cause the entire mRNA to cosediment with polysomes. Nonetheless, the strong bias of uORF ribosome footprints toward monosome cosedimentation indicates that when a ribosome is engaged on a uORF, all other ORFs in the mRNA tend to be unoccupied. Because sORFs and uORFs are predominantly monosome associated, these regions had much higher occupancy in the monosome libraries than in either the polysome or global libraries. This enhanced detection suggested that monosome footprinting might prove more effective for identifying new sORFs than global ribosome footprinting, especially sORFs in monocistronic transcripts. To find new translationally active ORFs, we combined the two monosome libraries, removed reads associated with previously annotated ORFs (canonical, sORFs and uORFs), and then identified clusters of overlapping or adjacent genome-mapping reads in the remainder. Examination of high coverage clusters revealed that most occurred either within annotated 5′ UTRs or the region immediately upstream. One example is a uORF upstream of PCL5 (Figure 3D). Previously published 5′ transcript leader sequencing data (Arribere and Gilbert, 2013Arribere J.A. Gilbert W.V. Roles for transcript leaders in translation and mRNA decay revealed by transcript leader sequencing.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 977-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) suggests the existence of alternate transcription start sites (TSSs) for PCL5. Therefore, this uORF is likely an alternatively included element regulating PCL5 translation (Pelechano et al., 2013Pelechano V. Wei W. Steinmetz L.M. Extensive transcriptional heterogeneity revealed by isoform profiling.Nature. 2013; 497: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To identify features other than ORF length that affect the monosome:polysome score, we next considered only the 3,121 CDS genes with a canonical ORF >590 nt (Figure 3A). Within this set, DESeq2 identified 204 monosome-enriched (p-adj ≤ 0.001; Figure 3A, purple dots) and 1,009 polysome-enriched (p-adj ≤ 0.001; Figure 3A, orange dots) mRNAs (Table S3). To define the most extreme set of polysome-enriched mRNAs, we also picked the 300 mRNAs exhibiting the smallest monosome:polysome score (Figure 3A, dark orange dots). The remaining 1,908 mRNAs not meeting the above cutoffs formed the “no enrichment” set (p-adj > 0.001; Figure 3A, gray dots). We then compared various features of these four gene sets (Figure 4; data from this paper or previously published). Polysome-enriched genes have higher median mRNA and protein abundances than the no-enrichment and monosome-enriched sets (Figures 4A and 4F). Further, as is also expected for highly expressed genes, the polysome-enriched sets exhibit higher mRNA synthesis rates and longer mRNA half-lives than either the no-enrichment or monosome-enriched set (Figures 4B and 4C). Finally, consistent with an evolutionary pressure toward more efficient translation, polysome-enriched mRNAs tend to have shorter 5′ UTRs (Figure 4D) and a higher optimal codon frequency (Figure 4E). In short, polysome-enriched mRNAs tend to be highly transcribed, have long mRNA half-lives, short 5′ UTRs, high codon optimality, and encode highly abundant proteins. In the above analysis, the monosome-enriched gene set had a lower median mRNA half-life than the no-enrichment set (Figure 4C; data from Presnyak et al., 2015Presnyak V. Alhusaini N. Chen Y.-H. Martin S. Morris N. Kline N. Olson S. Weinberg D. Baker K.E. Graveley B.R. Coller J. Codon optimality is a major determinant of mRNA stability.Cell. 2015; 160: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). One class of mRNAs expected to be monosome enriched with shorter than average half-lives are those subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD preferentially eliminates transcripts wherein the stop codon exists in a suboptimal context for termination (Amrani et al., 2004Amrani N. Ganesan R. Kervestin S. Mangus D.A. Ghosh S. Jacobson A. A faux 3′-UTR promotes aberrant termination and triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.Nature. 2004; 432: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and NMD targeting is thought to occur when the first or “pioneer” ribosome encounters this suboptimal stop codon (Gao et al., 2005Gao Q. Das B. Sherman F. Maquat L.E. Cap-binding protein 1-mediated and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-mediated pioneer rounds of translation in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 4258-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Two previous studies independently identified two classes of genes in S. cerevisiae whose mRNA levels depend on NMD: (1) those with strong evidence of being “direct” NMD targets, and (2) those for which the evidence might indicate “indirect” regulation by NMD (Guan et al., 2006Guan Q. Zheng W. Tang S. Liu X. Zinkel R.A. Tsui K.-W. Yandell B.S. Culbertson M.R. Impact of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay on the global expression profile of budding yeast.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e203Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, Johansson et al., 2007Johansson M.J.O. He F. Spatrick P. Li C. Jacobson A. Association of yeast Upf1p with direct substrates of the NMD pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 20872-20877Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To facilitate our own comparative analysis, we parsed these partially overlapping gene sets according to whether both studies concurred on direct NMD target status (our class A; 33 non-membrane genes with ORF length >590 nt), a single study indicated direct NMD target status (class B; 144 genes), and any other gene indicated as an indirect target by either study (class C; 166 genes) (Table S3). All other genes were placed into a “non-NMD target” bin. Consistent with expectation, global ribosome footprint RPKM boxplots revealed that all three NMD target sets exhibited significantly lower overall ribosome occupancy than the non-NMD set (Figure 5A). This tendency toward lower ribosome occupancy was also readily apparent in both a scatterplot of monosome versus polysome footprint RPKM (Figure 5C; quantified in Figures S4A and S4B) and boxplots of monosome:polysome scores (Figure 5C, inset). Unexpectedly, however, none of the three NMD target sets was statistically different from the non-NMD set with regard to mRNA half-life (Figure 5B). Thus, while NMD targets tend toward monosome occupancy, enrichment for NMD targets does not explain the lower median half-life of monosome-enriched mRNAs (Figure 4C). Consistent with this, the median half-life for monosome-enriched mRNAs remained significantly lower than the no enrichment set even when all known NMD targets were removed (Figure S4D). Thus, some feature other than NMD must be driving the lower stability of monosome-enriched mRNAs.Figure S4Characteristics of NMD-Regulated Genes, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A and B) Boxplots comparing mean ribosome footprint RPKM for NMD targets in monosome and polysome libraries, respectively.(C and D) Boxplots comparing mRNA half-life for monosome- and polysome-enriched genes sets either with (C) or without (D) NMD-regulated genes.(E and F) Boxplot comparing optimal codon frequency as in (C) and (D). ∗∗∗p < 2.2 × 10−16; ∗∗p ≤ 3.2 × 10−9; ∗p ≤ 0.0016; all others p > 0.05; Wilcoxon rank sum test compared to either ‘Remainder’ or ‘No enrichment’.View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2258427811,"Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, are shielded against the DNA damage response (DDR) by the shelterin complex. To understand how shelterin protects telomere ends, we investigated the structural organization of telomeric chromatin in human cells using super-resolution microscopy. We found that telomeres form compact globular structures through a complex network of interactions between shelterin subunits and telomeric DNA, but not by DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, or histone trimethylation at telomeres and subtelomeric regions. Mutations that abrogate shelterin assembly or removal of individual subunits from telomeres cause up to a 10-fold increase in telomere volume. Decompacted telomeres accumulate DDR signals and become more accessible to telomere-associated proteins. Recompaction of telomeric chromatin using an orthogonal method displaces DDR signals from telomeres. These results reveal the chromatin remodeling activity of shelterin and demonstrate that shelterin-mediated compaction of telomeric chromatin provides robust protection of chromosome ends against the DDR machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2259229417,"In recently developed approaches for high-resolution imaging within intact tissue, molecular characterization over large volumes has been largely restricted to labeling of proteins. But volumetric nucleic acid labeling may represent a far greater scientific and clinical opportunity, enabling detection of not only diverse coding RNA variants but also non-coding RNAs. Moreover, scaling immunohistochemical detection to large tissue volumes has limitations due to high cost, limited renewability/availability, and restricted multiplexing capability of antibody labels. With the goal of versatile, high-content, and scalable molecular phenotyping of intact tissues, we developed a method using carbodiimide-based chemistry to stably retain RNAs in clarified tissue, coupled with amplification tools for multiplexed detection. The resulting technology enables robust measurement of activity-dependent transcriptional signatures, cell-identity markers, and diverse non-coding RNAs in rodent and human tissue volumes. The growing set of validated probes is deposited in an online resource for nucleating related developments from across the scientific community."
https://openalex.org/W2261738454,"In vertebrate embryos, somites, the precursor of vertebrae, form from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), which is composed of cells displaying signaling oscillations. Cellular oscillatory activity leads to periodic wave patterns in the PSM. Here, we address the origin of such complex wave patterns. We employed an in vitro randomization and real-time imaging strategy to probe for the ability of cells to generate order from disorder. We found that, after randomization, PSM cells self-organized into several miniature emergent PSM structures (ePSM). Our results show an ordered macroscopic spatial arrangement of ePSM with evidence of an intrinsic length scale. Furthermore, cells actively synchronize oscillations in a Notch-signaling-dependent manner, re-establishing wave-like patterns of gene activity. We demonstrate that PSM cells self-organize by tuning oscillation dynamics in response to surrounding cells, leading to collective synchronization with an average frequency. These findings reveal emergent properties within an ensemble of coupled genetic oscillators."
https://openalex.org/W2253702229,"CorA, the major Mg2+ uptake system in prokaryotes, is gated by intracellular Mg2+ (KD ∼1–2 mM). X-ray crystallographic studies of CorA show similar conformations under Mg2+-bound and Mg2+-free conditions, but EPR spectroscopic studies reveal large Mg2+-driven quaternary conformational changes. Here, we determined cryo-EM structures of CorA in the Mg2+-bound closed conformation and in two open Mg2+-free states at resolutions of 3.8, 7.1, and 7.1 Å, respectively. In the absence of bound Mg2+, four of the five subunits are displaced to variable extents (∼10–25 Å) by hinge-like motions as large as ∼35° at the stalk helix. The transition between a single 5-fold symmetric closed state and an ensemble of low Mg2+, open, asymmetric conformational states is, thus, the key structural signature of CorA gating. This mechanism is likely to apply to other structurally similar divalent ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2268233375,"Memories formed early in life are particularly stable and influential, representing privileged experiences that shape enduring behaviors. We show that exposing newly hatched C. elegans to pathogenic bacteria results in persistent aversion to those bacterial odors, whereas adult exposure generates only transient aversive memory. Long-lasting imprinted aversion has a critical period in the first larval stage and is specific to the experienced pathogen. Distinct groups of neurons are required during formation (AIB, RIM) and retrieval (AIY, RIA) of the imprinted memory. RIM synthesizes the neuromodulator tyramine, which is required in the L1 stage for learning. AIY memory retrieval neurons sense tyramine via the SER-2 receptor, which is essential for imprinted, but not for adult-learned, aversion. Odor responses in several neurons, most notably RIA, are altered in imprinted animals. These findings provide insight into neuronal substrates of different forms of memory, and lay a foundation for further understanding of early learning."
https://openalex.org/W2267517347,"Addressing the lack of population-based data the purpose of this representative study was to assess procrastination and its associations with distress and life satisfaction across the life span. A representative German community sample (1,350 women; 1,177 men) between the ages of 14 and 95 years was examined by the short form of the General Procrastination Scale (GPS-K; 1) and standardized scales of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, fatigue and life satisfaction. As hypothesized, procrastination was highest in the youngest cohort (14–29 years). Only in the youngest and most procrastinating cohort (aged 14 to 29 years), men procrastinated more than women. As we had further hypothesized, procrastination was consistently associated with higher stress, more depression, anxiety, fatigue and reduced satisfaction across life domains, especially regarding work and income. Associations were also found with lack of a partnership and unemployment. Findings are discussed with regard to potential developmental and cohort effects. While procrastination appears to be a pervasive indicator for maladjustment, longitudinal analyses in high-risk samples (e.g. late adolescence, unemployment) are needed to identify means and mechanisms of procrastinating."
https://openalex.org/W2265314978,"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is characterized by dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and a profound derangement in the fecal metabolome. However, the contribution of specific gut microbes to fecal metabolites in C. difficile-associated gut microbiome remains poorly understood. Using gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and 16S rRNA deep sequencing, we analyzed the metabolome and microbiome of fecal samples obtained longitudinally from subjects with Clostridium difficile infection (n = 7) and healthy controls (n = 6). From 155 fecal metabolites, we identified two sterol metabolites at >95% match to cholesterol and coprostanol that significantly discriminated C. difficile-associated gut microbiome from healthy microbiota. By correlating the levels of cholesterol and coprostanol in fecal extracts with 2,395 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) determined by 16S rRNA sequencing, we identified 63 OTUs associated with high levels of coprostanol and 2 OTUs correlated with low coprostanol levels. Using indicator species analysis (ISA), 31 of the 63 coprostanol-associated bacteria correlated with health, and two Veillonella species were associated with low coprostanol levels that correlated strongly with CDI. These 65 bacterial taxa could be clustered into 12 sub-communities, with each community containing a consortium of organisms that co-occurred with one another. Our studies identified 63 human gut microbes associated with cholesterol-reducing activities. Given the importance of gut bacteria in reducing and eliminating cholesterol from the GI tract, these results support the recent finding that gut microbiome may play an important role in host lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2257186391,"Background and Purpose Pain and function improve dramatically in the first three months after hip and knee arthroplasty but the trajectory after three months is less well described. It is also unclear how pre-operative pain and function influence short- and long-term recovery. We explored the trajectory of change in function and pain until and beyond 3-months post-operatively and the influence of pre-operative self-reported symptoms. Methods The study was a prospective cohort study of 164 patients undergoing primary hip (n = 80) or knee (n = 84) arthroplasty in the United Kingdom. Self-reported measures of pain and function using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index were collected pre-operatively and at 3 and 12 months post-operatively. Hip and knee arthroplasties were analysed separately, and patients were split into two groups: those with high or low symptoms pre-operatively. Multilevel regression models were used for each outcome (pain and function), and the trajectories of change were charted (0–3 months and 3–12 months). Results Hip: Most improvement occurred within the first 3 months following hip surgery and patients with worse pre-operative scores had greater changes. The mean changes observed between 3 and twelve months were statistically insignificant. One year after surgery, patients with worse pre-operative scores had post-operative outcomes similar to those observed among patients with less severe pre-operative symptoms. Knee: Most improvement occurred in the first 3 months following knee surgery with no significant change thereafter. Despite greater mean change during the first three months, patients with worse pre-operative scores had not ‘caught-up’ with those with less severe pre-operative symptoms 12 months after their surgery. Conclusion Most symptomatic improvement occurred within the first 3 months after surgery with no significant change between 3–12 months. Further investigations are now required to determine if patients with severe symptoms at the time of their knee arthroplasty have a different pre-surgical history than those with less severe symptoms and if they could benefit from earlier surgical intervention and tailored rehabilitation to achieve better post-operative patient-reported outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2288165580,"Leishmania, the causative agent of vector-borne diseases, known as leishmaniases, is an obligate intracellular parasite within mammalian hosts. The outcome of infection depends largely on the activation status of macrophages, the first line of mammalian defense and the major target cells for parasite replication. Understanding the strategies developed by the parasite to circumvent macrophage defense mechanisms and to survive within those cells help defining novel therapeutic approaches for leishmaniasis. We previously showed the formation of lipid droplets (LDs) in L. major infected macrophages. Here, we provide novel insights on the origin of the formed LDs by determining their cellular distribution and to what extent these high-energy sources are directed to the proximity of Leishmania parasites. We show that the ability of L. major to trigger macrophage LD accumulation is independent of parasite viability and uptake and can also be observed in non-infected cells through paracrine stimuli suggesting that LD formation is from cellular origin. The accumulation of LDs is demonstrated using confocal microscopy and live-cell imagin in parasite-free cytoplasmic region of the host cell, but also promptly recruited to the proximity of Leishmania parasites. Indeed LDs are observed inside parasitophorous vacuole and in parasite cytoplasm suggesting that Leishmania parasites besides producing their own LDs, may take advantage of these high energy sources. Otherwise, these LDs may help cells defending against parasitic infection. These metabolic changes, rising as common features during the last years, occur in host cells infected by a large number of pathogens and seem to play an important role in pathogenesis. Understanding how Leishmania parasites and different pathogens exploit this LD accumulation will help us define the common mechanism used by these different pathogens to manipulate and/or take advantage of this high-energy source."
https://openalex.org/W2271907013,"Introduction The Geriatric Resources for the Assessment and Care of Elders (GRACE) program has been shown to decrease acute care utilization and increase patient self-rated health in low-income seniors at community-based health centers. Aims To describe adaptation of the GRACE model to include adults of all ages (named Care Support) and to evaluate the process and impact of Care Support implementation at an urban academic medical center. Setting 152 high-risk patients (≥5 ED visits or ≥2 hospitalizations in the past 12 months) enrolled from four medical clinics from 4/29/2013 to 5/31/2014. Program Description Patients received a comprehensive in-home assessment by a nurse practitioner/social worker (NP/SW) team, who then met with a larger interdisciplinary team to develop an individualized care plan. In consultation with the primary care team, standardized care protocols were activated to address relevant key issues as needed. Program Evaluation A process evaluation based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research identified key adaptations of the original model, which included streamlining of standardized protocols, augmenting mental health interventions and performing some assessments in the clinic. A summative evaluation found a significant decline in the median number of ED visits (5.5 to 0, p = 0.015) and hospitalizations (5.5 to 0, p<0.001) 6 months before enrollment in Care Support compared to 6 months after enrollment. In addition, the percent of patients reporting better self-rated health increased from 31% at enrollment to 64% at 9 months (p = 0.002). Semi-structured interviews with Care Support team members identified patients with multiple, complex conditions; little community support; and mild anxiety as those who appeared to benefit the most from the program. Discussion It was feasible to implement GRACE/Care Support at an academic medical center by making adaptations based on local needs. Care Support patients experienced significant reductions in acute care utilization and significant improvements in self-rated health."
https://openalex.org/W2256418771,"During chronic infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), bacilli multiplication is constrained within lung granulomas until excessive inflammation destroys the lung. Neutrophils are recruited early and participate in granuloma formation, but excessive neutrophilia exacerbates the tuberculosis disease. Neutrophils thus appear as potential targets for therapeutic interventions, especially in patients for whom no antibiotic treatment is possible. Signals that regulate neutrophil recruitment to the lung during mycobacterial infection need to be better understood. We demonstrated here, in the mouse model, that neutrophils were recruited to the lung in two waves after intranasal infection with virulent Mtb or the live attenuated vaccine strain Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG). A first wave of neutrophils was swiftly recruited, followed by a subsequent adaptive wave that reached the lung together with IFN-γ- and IL-17A-producing T cells. Interestingly, the second neutrophil wave did not participate to mycobacteria control in the lung and established contacts with T cells. The adaptive wave was critically dependent on the expression of IL-17RA, the receptor for IL-17A, expressed in non-hematopoietic cells. In absence of this receptor, curtailed CXCL-1 and 5 production in the lung restrained neutrophil recruitment. CXCL-1 and 5 instillation reconstituted lung neutrophil recruitment in BCG-infected IL17RA-/- mice."

This study investigated the heat, particulate matter (PM), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions in indoor air of commercial kitchen and its association with kidney dysfunctions among kitchen workers. A cross sectional study was conducted on 94 kitchen workers employed at commercial kitchen in Lucknow city, North India. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to collect the personal and occupational history of the kitchen workers. The urine analysis for specific gravity and microalbuminuria was conducted among the study subjects. Indoor air temperature, humidity, wet/ dry bulb temperature and humidex heat stress was monitored during cooking activities at the kitchen. Particulate matter (PM) for 1 and 2.5 microns were monitored in kitchen during working hours using Hazdust. PAHS in indoor air was analysed using UHPLC. Urinary hydroxy-PAHs in kitchen workers were measured using GC/MS-MS. Higher indoor air temperature, relative humidity, PM1 and PM2.5 (p<0.001) was observed in the kitchen due to cooking process. Indoor air PAHs identified are Napthalene, fluorine, acenaphthene, phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene and indeno [1,2,3-cd) pyrene. Concentrations of all PAHs identified in kitchen were above the permissible OSHA norms for indoor air. Specific gravity of urine was significantly higher among the kitchen workers (p<0.001) as compared to the control group. Also, the prevalence of microalbuminuria was higher (p<0.001) among kitchen workers. Urinary PAH metabolites detected among kitchen workers were 1-NAP, 9-HF, 3-HF, 9-PHN and 1-OHP. Continuous heat exposure in kitchens due to cooking can alter kidney functions viz., high specific gravity of urine in kitchen workers. Exposure to PM, VOCs and PAHs in indoor air and presence of urinary PAHs metabolites may lead to inflammation, which can cause microalbuminuria in kitchen workers, as observed in the present study."

https://openalex.org/W2257551672,"Background This study uses a MRI technique, three-dimension pulse continuous arterial spin labeling (3D-PCASL), to measure the patient’s cerebral blood flow (CBF) at the subacute stage of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in order to analyze the relationship between cerebral blood flow and neurocognitive deficits. Objective To provide the relationship between cortical CBF and neuropsychological dysfunction for the subacute MTBI patients. Methods After MTBI, perfusion MR imaging technique (3D-PCASL) measures the CBF of MTBI patients (n = 23) within 1 month and that of normal controls (n = 22) to determine the quantity and location of perfusion defect. The correlation between CBF abnormalities and cognitive deficits was elucidated by combining the results of the neuropsychological tests of the patients. Result We observed a substantial reduction in CBF in the bilateral frontal and left occipital cortex as compared with the normal persons. In addition, there were correlation between post concussive symptoms (including dizziness and simulator sickness) and CBF in the hypoperfused areas. The more severe symptom was correlated with higher CBF in bilateral frontal and left occipital lobes. Conclusion First, this study determined that despite no significant abnormality detected on conventional CT and MRI studies, hypoperfusion was observed in MTBI group using 3D-PCASL technique in subacute stage, which suggested that this approach may increase sensitivity to MTBI. Second, the correlation between CBF and the severity of post concussive symptoms suggested that changes in cerebral hemodynamics may play a role in pathophysiology underlies the symptoms."

Mucorales-specific T cells occur during the course of IM and are involved in the clearance of the infection. We have evaluated the feasibility of detecting Mucorales-specific T cells in hematological patients at risk for IM, and have correlated the detection of such cells with the clinical conditions of the patients.By using an enzyme linked immunospot assay, the presence of Mucorales-specific T cells in peripheral blood (PB) samples has been investigated at three time points during high-dose chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies. Mucorales-specific T cells producing interferon-γ, interleukin-10 and interleukin-4 were analysed in order to detect a correlation between the immune response and the clinical picture. Twenty-one (10.3%) of 204 patients, accounting for 32 (5.3%) of 598 PB samples, tested positive for Mucorales-specific T cells. Two groups could be identified. Group 1, including 15 patients without signs or symptoms of invasive fungal diseases (IFD), showed a predominance of Mucorales-specific T cells producing interferon-gamma. Group 2 included 6 patients with a clinical picture consistent with invasive fungal disease (IFD): 2 cases of proven IM and 4 cases of possible IFD. The proven patients had significantly higher number of Mucorales-specific T cells producing interleukin-10 and interleukin-4 and higher rates of positive samples by using derived diagnostic cut-offs when compared with the 15 patients without IFD.Mucorales-specific T cells can be detected and monitored in patients with hematologic malignancies at risk for IM. Mucorales-specific T cells polarized to the production of T helper type 2 cytokines are associated with proven IM and may be evaluated as a surrogate diagnostic marker for IM."

This study investigated the pathological findings and mortality of small cetaceans with the aim of detecting hazards and monitoring health trends in a high-biodiversity area. Between 2007 and 2012, 218 stranded cetaceans were recorded on the Paraná coast, southern Brazil. Fifty-seven (26.1%) of these animals, including 50 Sotalia guianensis, 2 Pontoporia blainvillei, 2 Stenella frontalis, 1 Stenella longirostris, 1 Tursiops truncatus and 1 Globicephala melas were necropsied and samples were collected for histopathology. Causes of death were determined in 46 of the 57 (80.7%) animals and most (30 or 65.2%) were ascribed to anthropogenic activities, including fisheries bycatch (28/30) and trauma (2/30). The remaining 16 fatalities were considered natural, and attributed to pneumonia (10/16), emaciation (3/16), septicemia (1/16), neonatal pathology (1/16) and choking via food obstruction (1/16). Irrespective of the cause, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, associated with parasitism, lymphadenitis and membranous glomerulonephritis were common findings among all fatalities. These results suggest, that while anthropogenic activities are a leading cause of cetacean strandings in Paraná, underlying pre-existing diseases may contribute towards deaths. Although the studied area is considered a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, complex anthropogenic and natural interactions might be occurring, increasing cetacean susceptibility to hazards. This study may help facilitate developing an effective conservation plan for coastal cetaceans focusing on reducing fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and pollution as mechanisms for ultimately increasing species resilience."
https://openalex.org/W2263939758,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that affects men and women in equal numbers, but some epidemiological studies indicate there may be sex differences in disease progression. One of the early symptoms of HD is disruptions in the circadian timing system, but it is currently unknown whether sex is a factor in these alterations. Since sex differences in HD could provide important insights to understand cellular and molecular mechanism(s) and designing early intervention strategies, we used the bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of HD (BACHD) to examine whether sex differences in circadian behavioral rhythms are detectable in an animal model of the disease. Similar to BACHD males, BACHD females display circadian disruptions at both 3 and 6 months of age; however, deficits to BACHD female mouse activity levels, rhythm precision, and behavioral fragmentation are either delayed or less severe relative to males. These sex differences are associated with a smaller suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in BACHD male mice at age of symptom onset (3 months), but are not associated with sex-specific differences in SCN daytime electrical activity deficits, or peptide expression (arginine vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide) within the SCN. Notably, BACHD females exhibited delayed motor coordination deficits, as measured using rotarod and challenge beam. These findings suggest a sex specific factor plays a role both in non-motor and motor symptom progression for the BACHD mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2254045887,"We previously reported that 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) and its metabolite 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) were up-regulated in pulmonary arterial cells from both pulmonary artery hypertension patients and hypoxic rats and that these factors mediated the progression of pulmonary hypertension (PH) by affecting the proliferation and apoptosis of pulmonary arterial (PA) cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of the remodeling induced by 15-HETE have remained unclear. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 15-LO are both induced by hypoxia, it is possible that ROS are involved in the events of hypoxia-induced 15-LO expression that lead to PH. We employed immunohistochemistry, tube formation assays, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays, and cell cycle analyses to explore the role of ROS in the process of 15-HETE-mediated hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH). We found that exogenous 15-HETE facilitated the generation of ROS and that this effect was mainly localized to mitochondria. In particular, the mitochondrial electron transport chain and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (Nox4) were responsible for the significant 15-HETE-stimulated increase in ROS production. Moreover, ROS induced by 15-HETE stimulated endothelial cell (EC) migration and promoted pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation under hypoxia via the p38 MAPK pathway. These results indicated that 15-HETE-regulated ROS mediated hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling (PVR) via the p38 MAPK pathway."

It is reasonable to assume that C. pneumoniae transports its proteins within host-intracellular organelles during infection, where they may work with host-cell proteome. The current study was performed for the prediction of nuclear targeting protein of C. pneumoniae in the host cell using bioinformatics predictors including ExPASy pI/Mw tool, nuclear localization signal (NLS) mapper, balanced sub cellular localization predictor (BaCeILo), and Hum-mPLoc 2.0. We predicted 47/1112 nuclear-targeting proteins of C. pneumoniae connected with several possible alterations in host replication and transcription during intracellular infection. These nuclear-targeting proteins may direct to competitive interactions of host and C. pneumoniae proteins with the availability of same substrate and may be involved as etiological agents in the growth and development of lung cancer. These novel findings are expected to access in better understanding of lung cancer etiology and identifying molecular targets for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2259121168,"Compensatory growth (CG), an accelerated growth phenomenon which occurs following a period of dietary restriction is exploited worldwide in animal production systems as a method to lower feed costs. However the molecular mechanisms regulated CG expression remain to be elucidated fully. This study aimed to uncover the underlying biology regulating CG in cattle, through an examination of skeletal muscle transcriptional profiles utilising next generation mRNA sequencing technology. Twenty Holstein Friesian bulls were fed either a restricted diet for 125 days, with a target growth rate of 0.6 kg/day (Period 1), following which they were allowed feed ad libitum for a further 55 days (Period 2) or fed ad libitum for the entirety of the trial. M. longissimus dorsi biopsies were harvested from all bulls on days 120 and 15 of periods 1 and 2 respectively and RNAseq analysis was performed. During re-alimentation in Period 2, previously restricted animals displayed CG, growing at 1.8 times the rate of the ad libitum control animals. Compensating animals were also more feed efficient during re-alimentation and compensated for 48% of their previous dietary restriction. 1,430 and 940 genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed (Benjamini Hochberg adjusted P < 0.1) in periods 1 and 2 respectively. Additionally, 2,237 genes were differentially expressed in animals undergoing CG relative to dietary restriction. Dietary restriction in Period 1 was associated with altered expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and energy production. CG expression in Period 2 occurred in association with greater expression of genes involved in cellular function and organisation. This study highlights some of the molecular mechanisms regulating CG in cattle. Differentially expressed genes identified are potential candidate genes for the identification of biomarkers for CG and feed efficiency, which may be incorporated into future breeding programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2281897400,"Synaptobrevin II (sybII) is a vesicular soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein that is essential for neurotransmitter release, and thus its correct trafficking to synaptic vesicles (SVs) is critical to render them fusion competent. The SV protein synaptophysin binds to sybII and facilitates its retrieval to SVs during endocytosis. Synaptophysin and sybII are the two most abundant proteins on SVs, being present in a 1:2 ratio. Synaptophysin and sybII are proposed to form a large multimeric complex, and the copy number of the proteins in this complex is also in a 1:2 ratio. We investigated the importance of this ratio between these proteins for the localisation and trafficking of sybII in central neurons. SybII was overexpressed in mouse hippocampal neurons at either 1.6 or 2.15–2.35-fold over endogenous protein levels, in the absence or presence of varying levels of synaptophysin. In the absence of exogenous synaptophysin, exogenous sybII was dispersed along the axon, trapped on the plasma membrane and retrieved slowly during endocytosis. Co-expression of exogenous synaptophysin rescued all of these defects. Importantly, the expression of synaptophysin at nerve terminals in a 1:2 ratio with sybII was sufficient to fully rescue normal sybII trafficking. These results demonstrate that the balance between synaptophysin and sybII levels is critical for the correct targeting of sybII to SVs and suggests that small alterations in synaptophysin levels might affect the localisation of sybII and subsequent presynaptic performance."
https://openalex.org/W2258060237,"The pathogenesis of fibromyalgia (FM) has not been clearly elucidated, but central sensitization, which plays an important role in the development of neuropathic pain, is considered to be the main mechanism. The cutaneous silent period (CSP), which is a spinal reflex mediated by A-delta cutaneous afferents, is useful for the evaluation of sensorimotor integration at the spinal and supraspinal levels. To understand the pathophysiology of FM, we compared CSP patterns between patients with FM and normal healthy subjects. Twenty-four patients with FM diagnosed in accordance with the 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification system and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were recruited. The CSP was measured from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Demographic data, number of tender points, and visual analog scale and FM impact questionnaire scores were collected. The measured CSP and clinical parameters of the patient and control groups were compared. In addition, possible correlations between the CSP parameters and the other clinical characteristics were analyzed. Mean CSP latencies did not differ between patients (55.50 ± 10.97 ms) and healthy controls (60.23 ± 11.87 ms; p = 0.158), although the mean CSP duration was significantly longer in patients (73.75 ± 15.67 ms) than in controls (63.50 ± 14.05 ms; p = 0.021). CSP variables did not correlate with any clinical variables. The significantly longer CSP duration in FM patients suggests central dysregulation at the spinal and supraspinal levels, rather than peripheral small fiber dysfunction."

Lampreys constitute excellent models to study the colonization of freshwater systems, as they commonly appear in pairs of closely related species of anadromous versus freshwater resident adults, thus having the ability to colonize new habitats, through the anadromous species, and establish freshwater resident derivates. We used 10 microsatellite loci to investigate the spatial structure, patterns of gene flow and migration routes of Lampetra populations in Europe. We sampled 11 populations including the migratory L. fluviatilis and four resident species, L. planeri, L. alavariensis, L. auremensis and L. lusitanica, the last three endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. In this southern glacial refugium almost all sampled populations represent a distinct genetic cluster, showing high levels of allopatric differentiation, reflecting long periods of isolation. As result of their more recent common ancestor, populations from northern Europe are less divergent among them, they are represented by fewer genetic clusters, and there is evidence of strong recent gene flow among populations. These previously glaciated areas from northern Europe may have been colonized from lampreys expanding out of the Iberian refugia. The pair L. fluviatilis/L. planeri is apparently at different stages of speciation in different locations, showing evidences of high reproductive isolation in the southern refugium, and low differentiation in the north."
https://openalex.org/W2270357178,"Accumulation of Aluminium (Al) at concentrations far above 1,000 mg kg-1 in aboveground plant tissues of Arbor aluminosa (Symplocos) species is the main reason why traditional Indonesian weavers rely on their leaves and bark as a mordant for dyeing textile. Recently, Symplocos species have become a flagship species for the conservation efforts of weaving communities due to their traditionally non-sustainable sampling and increasing demand for Symplocos plant material. Here we investigated Symplocos odoratissima, S. ophirensis and S. ambangensis at three montane rainforest sites in Central Sulawesi to measure Al levels in different tissues and organs. The highest Al concentrations were found in old leaves (24,180 ± 7,236 mg·kg-1 dry weight, mean ± SD), while young leaves had significantly lower Al levels (20,708 ± 7,025 mg·kg-1). Al accumulation was also lower in bark and wood tissue of the trunk (17,231 ± 8,356 mg·kg-1 and 5,181 ± 2,032 mg·kg-1, respectively). Two Al excluding species (Syzigium sp. and Lithocarpus sp.) contained only high Al levels in their roots. Moreover, no difference was found in soil pH (4.7 ± 0.61) and nutrient (K, Ca, Fe, Mg) availability at different soil levels and within or outside the crown of Symplocos trees, except for the upper soil layer. Furthermore, a positive and significant correlation between Al and Ca concentrations was found at the whole plant level for Symplocos, and at the leaf level for S. ophirensis and S. ambangensis, suggesting a potential role of Ca in Al uptake and/or detoxification within the plant. Our results provide evidence for strong Al accumulation in Symplocos species and illustrate that both Al accumulation and exclusion represent two co-occurring strategies of montane rainforest plants for dealing with Al toxicity. Indonesian weavers should be encouraged to harvest old leaves, which have the most efficient mordant capacity due to high Al concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2410423566,"Advanced hemodynamic monitoring is a critical component of treatment in clinical situations where aggressive yet guided hemodynamic interventions are required in order to stabilize the patient and optimize outcomes. While there are many tools at a physician's disposal to monitor patients in a hospital setting, the reality is that none of these tools allow hi-fidelity assessment or continuous monitoring towards early detection of hemodynamic instability. We present an advanced automated analytical system which would act as a continuous monitoring and early warning mechanism that can indicate pending decompensation before traditional metrics can identify any clinical abnormality. This system computes novel features or bio-markers from both heart rate variability (HRV) as well as the morphology of the electrocardiogram (ECG). To compare their effectiveness, these features are compared with the standard HRV based bio-markers which are commonly used for hemodynamic assessment. This study utilized a unique database containing ECG waveforms from healthy volunteer subjects who underwent simulated hypovolemia under controlled experimental settings. A support vector machine was utilized to develop a model which predicts the stability or instability of the subjects. Results showed that the proposed novel set of features outperforms the traditional HRV features in predicting hemodynamic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2268701371,"Introduction Like many developing countries, Serbia is facing a growing burden of chronic diseases. Within such public health issue, multi-morbidity requires a special attention. Aims This study investigated the prevalence of multi-morbidity in the Serbia population and assessed the co-occurrence of chronic diseases by age and gender. Methods We analyzed data from the 2013 National Health Survey, which included 13,103 individuals ≥ 20 years old. Multi-morbidity patterns were identified by exploratory factor analysis of data on self-reported chronic diseases, as well as data on measured body weight and height. The analysis was stratified by age and gender. Results Multi-morbidity was present in nearly one-third of respondents (26.9%) and existed in all age groups, with the highest prevalence among individuals aged 65 years and older (47.2% of men and 65.0% of women). Six patterns of multi-morbidity were identified: non-communicable, cardio-metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascular, aggregate, and mechanical/mental/metabolic. The non-communicable pattern was observed in both genders but only in the 20–44 years age group, while the aggregate pattern occurred only in middle-aged men. Cardio-metabolic and respiratory patterns were present in all age groups. Cardiovascular and mechanical/mental/metabolic patterns showed similar presentation in both men and women. Conclusions Multi-morbidity is a common occurrence among adults in Serbia, especially in the elderly. While several patterns may be explained by underlying pathophysiologies, some require further investigation and follow-up. Recognizing the complexity of multi-morbidity in Serbia is of great importance from both clinical and preventive perspectives given that it affects one-third of the population and may require adjustment of the healthcare system to address the needs of affected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2268141598,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative bacterium of Johne’s disease (JD) in ruminants. The control of JD in the dairy industry is challenging, but can be improved with a better understanding of the diversity and distribution of MAP subtypes. Previously established molecular typing techniques used to differentiate MAP have not been sufficiently discriminatory and/or reliable to accurately assess the population structure. In this study, the genetic diversity of 182 MAP isolates representing all Canadian provinces was compared to the known global diversity, using single nucleotide polymorphisms identified through whole genome sequencing. MAP isolates from Canada represented a subset of the known global diversity, as there were global isolates intermingled with Canadian isolates, as well as multiple global subtypes that were not found in Canada. One Type III and six “Bison type” isolates were found in Canada as well as one Type II subtype that represented 86% of all Canadian isolates. Rarefaction estimated larger subtype richness in Québec than in other Canadian provinces using a strict definition of MAP subtypes and lower subtype richness in the Atlantic region using a relaxed definition. Significant phylogeographic clustering was observed at the inter-provincial but not at the intra-provincial level, although most major clades were found in all provinces. The large number of shared subtypes among provinces suggests that cattle movement is a major driver of MAP transmission at the herd level, which is further supported by the lack of spatial clustering on an intra-provincial scale."
https://openalex.org/W2285326560,"In classic Hairy cell leukaemia (HCLc), a single case has thus far been interrogated by whole exome sequencing (WES) in a treatment naive patient, in which BRAF V(600)E was identified as an acquired somatic mutation and confirmed as occurring near-universally in this form of disease by conventional PCR-based cohort screens. It left open however the question whether other genome-wide mutations may also commonly occur at high frequency in presentation HCLc disease. To address this, we have carried out WES of 5 such typical HCLc cases, using highly purified splenic tumour cells paired with autologous T cells for germline. Apart from BRAF V(600)E, no other recurrent somatic mutation was identified in these HCLc exomes, thereby excluding additional acquired mutations as also prevalent at a near-universal frequency in this form of the disease. These data then place mutant BRAF at the centre of the neoplastic drive in HCLc. A comparison of our exome data with emerging genetic findings in HCL indicates that additional somatic mutations may however occur recurrently in smaller subsets of disease. As mutant BRAF alone is insufficient to drive malignant transformation in other histological cancers, it suggests that individual tumours utilise largely differing patterns of genetic somatic mutations to coalesce with BRAF V(600)E to drive pathogenesis of malignant HCLc disease."
https://openalex.org/W2262679001,"Background Low- and middle-income countries are currently facing the massive public health challenge of road traffic injuries. The lack of effective surveillance systems hinders proper assessment of epidemiologic status and intervention priorities. The objective of our study was to estimate the mortality and morbidity attributable to road crashes in Bamako, Mali using the capture-recapture method. Methods During the 1 January, 2012–31 April, 2012 period, we collected data on road traffic crashes from the road accident registers of the police forces of Bamako, Mali on the one hand, and from a register kept by health facilities in the same area. An automatic, then manual matching procedure was performed to find pairs of records related to the same crash victims. The number of victims and the number of fatalities were estimated by the capture-recapture method using the Chapman estimator. Results The health facility and the police registries included 3587 and 1432 records, respectively. The matching procedure identified 603 common records, 31 of which were fatalities. The annual incidence estimate for road victims was 1038 in 100 000 and the annual incidence estimate for road fatalities was 12 in 100 000. Victims from both sources were more likely to be male, in the 15–34 age group, and almost half of all injured road users and two in three fatalities were using motorized two-wheelers. One victim out of five was a pedestrian. Conclusion Our estimates are in line with available literature data from low-income countries. While more cases were reported by health facilities than by police forces, we believe that an effective surveillance system should not be based solely on medical reports as much would be missing as regards the crash circumstances and characteristics."

A homozygous 6.7kbp LILRA3 gene deletion that removes the first seven of its eight exons is predicted to lead to lack of LILRA3 protein, although this has not been experimentally confirmed. Moreover, there are conflicting results with regards to the link between the LILRA3 homozygous genetic deletion and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) in different European populations. The aim of this study was to investigate whether LILRA3 gene deletion is associated with MS susceptibility in a North American cohort of European ancestry and assess if serum LILRA3 protein level is a marker of clinical subtype and/or disease severity in MS. A total of 456 patients with MS and 99 unrelated healthy controls were genotyped for the 6.7kbp LILRA3 gene deletion and levels of LILRA3 protein in sera determined by in-house sandwich ELISA. We showed that LILRA3 gene deletion was not associated with MS susceptibility and did not affect the age of disease onset, clinical subtype or disease severity. However, we discovered for the first time that homozygous LILRA3 gene deletion results in lack of production of LILRA3 protein. Importantly, LILRA3 protein level was significantly increased in sera of patients with MS when compared with control subjects, particularly in more severe type primary progressive MS. Multiple regression analysis showed that LILRA3 level in serum was one of the strongest independent markers of disease severity in MS, which potentially can be used as a diagnostic marker."

Healthy and diseased engineered cartilage from human chondrocytes (cultured in agar gels) were integrated with human bone marrow stem cell (HBMSC)-derived cartilaginous engineered matrix with and without HA, and evaluated after 28 days of growth. HBMSCs were seeded within photopolymerizable poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels. In addition, we also conducted a preliminary in vivo evaluation of cartilage repair in rabbit knee chondral defects treated with subchondral bone microfracture and cell-free PEGDA with and without HA. Under in vitro conditions, the interfacial shear strength between tissue engineered cartilage derived from HBMSCs and osteoarthritic chondrocytes was significantly higher (p < 0.05) when HA nanoparticles were incorporated within the HBMSC culture system. Histological evidence confirmed a distinct spatial transition zone, rich in calcium phosphate deposits. Assessment of explanted rabbit knees by histology demonstrated that cellularity within the repair tissues that had filled the defects were of significantly higher number (p < 0.05) when HA was used. HA nanoparticles play an important role in treating chondral defects when osteoarthritis is a co-morbidity. We speculate that the calcified layer formation at the interface in the osteoarthritic environment in the presence of HA is likely to have attributed to higher interfacial strength found in vitro. From an in vivo standpoint, the presence of HA promoted cellularity in the tissues that subsequently filled the chondral defects. This higher presence of cells can be considered important in the context of accelerating long-term cartilage remodeling. We conclude that HA nanoparticles play an important role in engineered to native cartilage integration and cellular processes."

They play a crucial role in modulating genetic expression of their targets, which makes them integral components of transcriptional regulatory networks. As sponges (phylum Porifera) are commonly considered the most basal metazoan, the in-depth capture of miRNAs from these organisms provides additional clues to the evolution of miRNA families in metazoans. Here, we identified the core proteins involved in the biogenesis of miRNAs, and obtained evidence for bona fide miRNA sequences for two marine sponges Stylissa carteri and Xestospongia testudinaria (11 and 19 respectively). Our analysis identified several miRNAs that are conserved amongst demosponges, and revealed that all of the novel miRNAs identified in these two species are specific to the class Demospongiae."
https://openalex.org/W2473883462,"Introduction There is high variability amongst physicians’ assessments of appropriate ICU admissions, which may be based on potential assessments of benefit. We aimed to examine whether opinions over benefit of ICU admissions of critically ill medical inpatients differed based on physician specialty, namely intensivists and internists. Materials and Methods We carried out an anonymous, web-based questionnaire survey containing 5 typical ICU cases to all ICU physicians regardless of their base specialty as well as to all internists in 3 large teaching hospitals. For each case, we asked the participants to determine if the patient was an appropriate ICU admission and to assess different parameters (e.g. baseline function, likelihood of survival to ICU discharge, etc.). Agreement was measured using kappa values. Results 21 intensivists and 22 internists filled out the survey (response rate = 87.5% and 35% respectively). Predictions of likelihood of survival to ICU admission, hospital discharge and return to baseline were not significantly different between the two groups. However, agreement between individuals within each group was only slight to fair (kappa range = 0.09–0.22). There was no statistically significant difference in predicting ICU survival and prediction of survival to hospital discharge between both groups. The accuracy with which physicians predicted actual outcomes ranged between 35% and 100% and did not significantly differ between the two groups. A greater proportion of internists favoured non resuscitative measures (24.6% of intensivists and 46.9% internists [p = 0.002]). Conclusion In a case-based survey, physician specialty base did not affect assessments of ICU admission benefit or accuracy in outcome prediction, but resulted in a statistically significant difference in level of care assignments. Of note, significant disagreement amongst individuals in each group was found."

Previous research advocates different approaches of how to introduce principles to foster the transfer of knowledge about formal principles. One approach suggests teaching a generic formalism of the principles. Another approach suggests presenting (at least) two concrete cases instantiating the principle. A third approach suggests presenting a generic formalism accompanied by a case. As yet, though, empirical results regarding the transfer potential of these approaches are mixed and difficult to integrate as the three approaches have rarely been tested competitively. Furthermore, the approaches have been evaluated in relation to different control conditions, and they have been assessed using varying transfer measures. In the present experiment, we introduced undergraduates to the formal principles of propositional logic with the aim to systematically compare the transfer potential of the different approaches in relation to each other and to a common control condition by using various learning and transfer tasks. Results indicate that all approaches supported successful learning and transfer of the principles, but also caused systematic differences in the magnitude of transfer. Results indicate that the combination of a generic formalism with a case was surprisingly unsuccessful while learners who compared two cases outperformed the control condition. We discuss how the simultaneous assessment of the different approaches allows to more precisely capture the underlying learning mechanisms and to advance theory on how these mechanisms contribute to transfer performance."
https://openalex.org/W2255468460,"HIV patients have an increased risk to develop sepsis and HIV infection affects several components of the immune system involved in sepsis pathogenesis. We hypothesized that HIV infection might aggrevate the aberrant immune response during sepsis, so we aimed to determine the impact of HIV infection on the genomic host response to sepsis. We compared whole blood leukocyte gene expression profiles among sepsis patients with or without HIV co-infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) and validated our findings in a cohort of patients admitted to the same ICUs in a different time frame. To examine the influence of HIV infection per se, we also determined the expression of genes of interest in a cohort of asymptomatic HIV patients. We identified a predominantly common host response in sepsis patients with or without HIV co-infection. HIV positive sepsis patients in both ICU cohorts showed overexpression of genes involved in granzyme signaling (GZMA, GZMB), cytotoxic T-cell signaling (CD8A, CD8B) and T-cell inhibitory signaling (LAG3), compared to HIV negative patients. Enhanced expression of CD8A, CD8B and LAG3 was also unmasked in asymptomatic HIV patients. Plasma levels of granzymes in sepsis patients were largely below detection limit, without differences according to HIV status. These results demonstrate that sepsis is characterized by a massive common response with few differences between HIV positive and HIV negative sepsis patients. Observed differences in granzyme signaling, cytotoxic T-cell signaling and T-cell inhibitory signaling appear to be changes commonly observed in asymptomatic HIV patients which persist during sepsis."

Previous study indicated that aquareovirus NS80 is able to form inclusion bodies, and also can retain viral proteins within its inclusions. To better understand how NS80 performed in viral replication and assembly, the functional regions of NS80 associated with other viral proteins in aquareovirus replication were investigated in this study. Deletion mutational analysis and rotavirus NSP5-based protein association platform were used to detect association regions. Immunofluorescence images indicated that different N-terminal regions of NS80 could associate with viral proteins VP1, VP4, VP6 and NS38. Further co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction between VP1, VP4, VP6 or NS38 with different regions covering the N-terminal amino acid (aa, 1–471) of NS80, respectively. Moreover, removal of NS80 N-terminal sequences required for interaction with proteins VP1, VP4, VP6 or NS38 not only prevented the capacity of NS80 to support viral replication in NS80 shRNA-based replication complementation assays, but also inhibited the expression of aquareovirus proteins, suggesting that N-terminal regions of NS80 are necessary for viral replication. These results provided a foundational basis for further understanding the role of NS80 in viral replication and assembly during aquareovirus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2271586176,"The omnipresent need for optimisation requires constant improvements of companies' business processes (BPs). Minimising the risk of inappropriate BP being implemented is usually performed by simulating the newly developed BP under various initial conditions and ""what-if"" scenarios. An effectual business process simulations software (BPSS) is a prerequisite for accurate analysis of an BP. Characterisation of an BPSS tool is a challenging task due to the complex selection criteria that includes quality of visual aspects, simulation capabilities, statistical facilities, quality reporting etc. Under such circumstances, making an optimal decision is challenging. Therefore, various decision support models are employed aiding the BPSS tool selection. The currently established decision support models are either proprietary or comprise only a limited subset of criteria, which affects their accuracy. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a new hierarchical decision support model for ranking of BPSS based on their technical characteristics by employing DEX and qualitative to quantitative (QQ) methodology. Consequently, the decision expert feeds the required information in a systematic and user friendly manner. There are three significant contributions of the proposed approach. Firstly, the proposed hierarchical model is easily extendible for adding new criteria in the hierarchical structure. Secondly, a fully operational decision support system (DSS) tool that implements the proposed hierarchical model is presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical model is assessed by comparing the resulting rankings of BPSS with respect to currently available results."
https://openalex.org/W2252743444,"Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is receiving substantial attention for its sensitivity to functional abnormality in the brain networks of people with psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, because of the variety of rs-fMRI processing methods, the necessity of rs-fMRI quality assurance is increasing. Conventionally, the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) is generally adopted for quality examination, but the tSNR does not guarantee reliable functional connectivity (FC) outcomes. Theoretically, intrinsic FC is supposed to reflect the spontaneous synchronization of neuronal basis, rather than that from thermal noise or non-neuronal physiological noise. Therefore, we proposed a new quality-assurance index for rs-fMRI to estimate the physiological contributions in spontaneous oscillations (PICSO). The PICSO index was designed as a voxel-wise measure for facilitating practical applications to all existing rs-fMRI data sets on the basis of two assumptions: Gaussian distributions in temporal fluctuations and ultra-slow changes of neural-based physiological fluctuations. To thoroughly validate the sensitivity of the proposed PICSO index to FC, we calibrated the preprocessing steps according to phantom data and verified the relationship between the PICSO and factors that are considered to affect FC in healthy participants (n = 12). Our results demonstrated that FC showed a significantly positive correlation with the PICSO. Moreover, for generating robust FC outcomes, directly acquiring data at a relatively large voxel size was more effective than performing smoothness on high-resolution data sets. In conclusion, compared with tSNR, the PICSO index is more sensitive to the resulting FC, providing a practical quality-assurance indicator for all existing rs-fMRI data sets."

Methods A Markov model was created to compare seven prophylaxis strategies: 1) primary prophylaxis (PP) with nivestim (biosimilar filgrastim) throughout all cycles of chemotherapy; 2) PP with nivestim during the first two cycles of chemotherapy; 3) secondary prophylaxis (SP) with nivestim; 4) PP with pegfilgrastim throughout all cycles of chemotherapy; 5) PP with pegfilgrastim during the first two cycles of chemotherapy; 6) SP with pegfilgrastim; and 7) no prophylaxis (NP). The perspective of a hospital was taken and cost-effectiveness was expressed as the cost per episode of FN avoided over six cycles of chemotherapy. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results Strategies 3, 6, and 7 were dominated in the base case analysis by strategy 5. The costs associated with strategies 2, 5, 1, and 4 were US$3,813, US$4,056, US$4,545, and US$5,331, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for strategy 5 vs. strategy 2, strategy 1 vs. strategy 5, and strategy 4 vs. strategy 1 were US$13,532, US$22,565, and US$30,452, respectively, per episode of FN avoided. Strategy 2 has the highest probability to be cost-effective (ranged from 48% to 60%) when the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold is lower than US$10,000 per FN episode prevented. Conclusion In Singapore, routine PP with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (nivestim or pegfilgrastim) is cost-effective for reducing the risk of FN in patients receiving R-CHOP."
https://openalex.org/W2261150688,"Evolutionary arms races between pathogens and their hosts may be manifested as selection for rapid evolutionary change of key genes, and are sometimes detectable through sequence-level analyses. In the case of protein-coding genes, such analyses frequently predict that specific codons are under positive selection. However, detecting positive selection can be non-trivial, and false positive predictions are a common concern in such analyses. It is therefore helpful to place such predictions within a structural and functional context. Here, we focus on the p19 protein from tombusviruses. P19 is a homodimer that sequesters siRNAs, thereby preventing the host RNAi machinery from shutting down viral infection. Sequence analysis of the p19 gene is complicated by the fact that it is constrained at the sequence level by overprinting of a viral movement protein gene. Using homology modeling, in silico mutation and molecular dynamics simulations, we assess how non-synonymous changes to two residues involved in forming the dimer interface-one invariant, and one predicted to be under positive selection-impact molecular function. Interestingly, we find that both observed variation and potential variation (where a non-synonymous change to p19 would be synonymous for the overprinted movement protein) does not significantly impact protein structure or RNA binding. Consequently, while several methods identify residues at the dimer interface as being under positive selection, MD results suggest they are functionally indistinguishable from a site that is free to vary. Our analyses serve as a caveat to using sequence-level analyses in isolation to detect and assess positive selection, and emphasize the importance of also accounting for how non-synonymous changes impact structure and function."

Several risk factors of PAD have been observed in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, we hypothesize that the incidence of PAD is higher in the schizophrenia population than in the general population. Methods The patients in this population-based cohort study were selected from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database on the basis of the claims data from 2000 to 2011. We compared the incidence of PAD between schizophrenia and nonschizophrenia cohorts. Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed for analyzing the risk of PAD after adjustment for sex, age, and comorbidities. Results The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for PAD in the schizophrenia cohort was 1.26-fold higher than that in the nonschizophrenia cohort. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia using atypical antipsychotics exhibited a high adjusted HR for PAD. Conclusion Compared with the general population, the risk of PAD is higher among patients with schizophrenia. Early diagnosis and intervention can mitigate complications resulting from cardiovascular diseases and lower mortality."

We have investigated whether such complement inhibitor binding occurs after vaccination with native outer membrane vesicles (nOMVs), and limits immunogenicity of such vaccines. To this end, nOMVs reactogenic lipopolysaccharide was detoxified by deletion of the lpxl1 gene (nOMVlpxl1). nOMVs unable to bind human complement factor H (hfH) were generated by additional deletions of the genes encoding factor H binding protein (fHbp) and neisserial surface protein A (NspA) (nOMVdis). Antibody responses elicited in mice with nOMVdis were compared to those elicited with nOMVlpxl1 in the presence of hfH. Results demonstrate that the administration of human fH to mice immunized with fHbp containing OMVlpxl1 decreased immunogenicity against fHbp (but not against the OMV as a whole). The majority of the OMV-induced bactericidal immune response (OMVlpxl1 or OMVdis) was versus PorA. Despite a considerable reduction of hfH binding to nOMVdis, and the absence of the vaccine antigen fHbp, immunogenicity in mice was not different from nOMVlpxl1, in the absence or presence of hfH (serum bactericidal titers of 1:64 vs 1:128 after one dose in the nOMVdis and nOMVlpxl1–immunized groups respectively). Therefore, partial inhibition of fH binding did not enhance immunity in this model."
