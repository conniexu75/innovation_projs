Sustainable use of renewable resources requires strategies for converting complex and recalcitrant biomolecules into streams of chemicals with extraordinary efficiency. Liao et al. developed a biorefinery concept in which wood is eventually fully converted into useful chemicals: phenol, propylene, pulp amenable to ethanol production, and phenolic oligomers that can be incorporated into ink production (see the Perspective by Zhang). A life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis highlight the efficiency of the process and reveal the potential for such biorefinery strategies to contribute to sustainable chemicals markets.

Berdugo et al. show that increasing aridity promotes thresholds on the structure and functioning of drylands (see the Perspective by Hirota and Oliveira). Their database includes 20 variables summarizing multiple aspects and levels of ecological organization. They found evidence for a series of abrupt ecological events occurring sequentially in three phases, culminating with a shift to low-cover ecosystems that are nutrient- and species-poor at high aridity values. They estimate that more than 20% of land surface will cross at least one of the thresholds by 2100, which can potentially lead to widespread land degradation and desertification worldwide.

However, heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction are prone to deactivation through unwanted carbon deposition (coking) and loss of surface area of adsorbed metal nanoparticles through agglomeration (sintering). Y. Song et al. used highly crystalline fumed magnesium oxide to support molybdenumdoped nickel nanoparticle catalysts (see the Perspective by Chen and Xu). On heating, the nanoparticles migrated on the oxide surface to step edges to form larger, highly stable nanoparticles. This process also passivated sites for coking on the oxide to produce a catalyst with high activity and longevity at 800°C. Science , this issue p. 777 ; see also p. 737"
https://openalex.org/W3005621022,"Summary Functional MRI and electrophysiology studies suggest that consciousness depends on large-scale thalamocortical and corticocortical interactions. However, it is unclear how neurons in different cortical layers and circuits contribute. We simultaneously recorded from central lateral thalamus (CL) and across layers of the frontoparietal cortex in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We found that neurons in thalamus and deep cortical layers are most sensitive to changes in consciousness level, consistent across different anesthetic agents and sleep. Deep-layer activity is sustained by interactions with CL. Consciousness also depends on deep-layer neurons providing feedback to superficial layers (not to deep layers), suggesting that long-range feedback and intracolumnar signaling are important. To show causality, we stimulated CL in anesthetized macaques and effectively restored arousal and wake-like neural processing. This effect was location and frequency specific. Our findings suggest layer-specific thalamocortical correlates of consciousness and inform how targeted deep brain stimulation can alleviate disorders of consciousness."

Some soft ionic conductors have been made in the form of flexible, stretchable, and transparent devices, but leaks from these materials is a concern. Kim et al. demonstrate ionic elastomeric diodes and transistors that harness ionic double layers to rectify and switch ionic currents (see the Perspective by Gao and Lee). This is achieved without trapped liquids by fixing the anions or cations to an elastomer network while the other species of ions remain mobile. Science , this issue p. 773 ; see also p. 735"

However, Ray et al. found that in animals lacking BMAL1, peripheral tissues synchronized with a brief pulse of the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone appear to retain a 24-hour pacemaker that sustains rhythmic gene expression, protein abundance, and protein phosphorylation in excised liver cells and fibroblasts (see the Perspective by Brown and Sato). These oscillations persisted in the absence of cues from changes in light or temperature. The results raise intriguing questions about the possible nature of the oscillator that maintains the observed rhythms. Science , this issue p. 800 ; see also p. 740"

In turn, plant genomes encode genes that determine species-specific recognition of these effectors by a process known collectively as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). By examining a range of strains of the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae that infect the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , Laflamme et al. generated a P. syringae Type III Effector Compendium (PsyTEC) and in turn identified the genes responsible for ETI in Arabidopsis. This pan-genome analysis revealed that relatively few A. thaliana genes are responsible for recognizing the majority of P. syringae effectors. These results provide insight into why most pathogenic microbes only infect specific plant species. Science , this issue p. 763"
https://openalex.org/W3006557963,"A critical driver of the ocean carbon cycle is the downward flux of sinking organic particles, which acts to lower the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. This downward flux is reduced by more than 70% in the mesopelagic zone (100 to 1000 meters of depth), but this loss cannot be fully accounted for by current measurements. For decades, it has been hypothesized that the missing loss could be explained by the fragmentation of large aggregates into small particles, although data to test this hypothesis have been lacking. In this work, using robotic observations, we quantified total mesopelagic fragmentation during 34 high-flux events across multiple ocean regions and found that fragmentation accounted for 49 ± 22% of the observed flux loss. Therefore, fragmentation may be the primary process controlling the sequestration of sinking organic carbon."

Mary et al. studied survivors of the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks who developed posttraumatic stress disorder and those who did not (see the Perspective by Ersche). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, they investigated the neural networks underlying the control and suppression of memory retrieval. The results suggest that the characteristic symptoms of the disorder are not related to the memory itself but to its maladaptive control. These results offer new insights into the development of post-traumatic stress disorder and potential avenues for treatment. Science , this issue p. eaay8477 ; see also p. 734"

This decline has been called out as a potential catastrophe for amphibian species. What has been less explored are the impacts of amphibian declines on other members of their ecological communities. Using survey data collected over 13 years, Zipkin et al. looked at diversity and body condition of a tropical snake community after amphibians were decimated by chytridiomycosis. They found that the snake community was less diverse and most species were in decline, except for a few “winning” species. Science , this issue p. 814"
https://openalex.org/W3107996366,"Symmetries crucially underlie the classification of topological phases of matter. Most materials, both natural as well as architectured, possess crystalline symmetries. Recent theoretical works unveiled that these crystalline symmetries can stabilize fragile Bloch bands that challenge our very notion of topology: while answering to the most basic definition of topology, one can trivialize these bands through the addition of trivial Bloch bands. Here, we fully characterize the symmetry properties of the response of an acoustic metamaterial to establish the fragile nature of the low-lying Bloch bands. Additionally, we present a spectral signature in the form of spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions."

In this system, Nagaoka et al. identified the gene Zglp1 as a necessary and sufficient factor for conferring the oogenic fate to sexually undetermined germ cells. As a downstream effector of bone morphogenetic protein signaling, conserved transcriptional regulator ZGLP1 activates the oogenic program repressed by Polycomb activities, whereas retinoic acid signaling assists the maturation of such activation and also the repression of the primordial germ cell program. This study thus refines our understanding of mammalian oogenic fate determination. Science , this issue p. eaaw4115"

https://openalex.org/W2964983417,"The ground state of charge neutral graphene under perpendicular magnetic field was predicted to be a quantum Hall topological insulator with a ferromagnetic order and spin-filtered, helical edge channels. In most experiments, however, an otherwise insulating state is observed and is accounted for by lattice-scale interactions that promote a broken-symmetry state with gapped bulk and edge excitations. We tuned the ground state of the graphene zeroth Landau level to the topological phase via a suitable screening of the Coulomb interaction with a SrTiO$_3$ high-$k$ dielectric substrate. We observed robust helical edge transport emerging at a magnetic field as low as 1 tesla and withstanding temperatures up to 110 kelvins over micron-long distances. This new and versatile graphene platform opens new avenues for spintronics and topological quantum computation."

We study its surface composition using data collected by the New Horizons spacecraft. Methanol ice is present along with organic material, which may have formed through radiation of simple molecules. Water ice was not detected. This composition indicates hydrogenation of carbon monoxide-rich ice and/ or energetic processing of methane condensed on water ice grains in the cold, outer edge of the early Solar System. There are only small regional variations in color and spectra across the surface, suggesting Arrokoth formed from a homogeneous or well-mixed reservoir of solids. Microwave thermal emission from the winter night side is consistent with a mean brightness temperature of 29$\pm$5 K."
https://openalex.org/W3006276127,"Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) responds poorly to checkpoint blockade, such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1. Galectin-9, a β-galactoside-binding lectin, promotes immune suppression through T-cell inhibition, and programming of tolerogenic macrophages. Of all cancers tested, PDAC showed the highest expression of LGALS9 (galectin-9) mRNA. We analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens from 83 patients with PDAC stained for galectin-9. Using flow cytometry, we determined galectin-9 expression on immune cells from tumor and matched blood samples from 12 patients with resectable PDAC. Furthermore, we analyzed galectin-9 serum levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using serum samples from 70 patients with PDAC, from 36 individuals with benign pancreatic disease, and from 28 healthy controls. Galectin-9 was highly expressed in human PDAC compared with normal pancreas and present on both tumor and immune cells. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially CD3 + T cells, showed upregulation of galectin-9 compared with immune cells from matched blood. Blood γδ T cells from PDAC patients had higher galectin-9 expression than γδ T cells from healthy individuals. Galectin-9 polarized macrophages toward a protumoral M2 phenotype leading to suppressed T-cell cytokine secretion. Furthermore, serum concentration of galectin-9 was able to discriminate PDAC from benign pancreatic disease and healthy individuals, and was prognostic for stage IV patients. Galectin-9 is a new biomarker for the detection of PDAC."

https://openalex.org/W3006082865,"Current theories suggest that an error-driven learning process updates trial-by-trial to facilitate motor adaptation. How this process interacts with motor cortical preparatory activity—which current models suggest plays a critical role in movement initiation—remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the role of motor preparation during visuomotor adaptation. We found that preparation time was inversely correlated to variance of errors on current trials and mean error on subsequent trials. We also found causal evidence that intracortical microstimulation during motor preparation was sufficient to disrupt learning. Surprisingly, stimulation did not affect current trials, but instead disrupted the update computation of a learning process, thereby affecting subsequent trials. This is consistent with a Bayesian estimation framework where the motor system reduces its learning rate by virtue of lowering error sensitivity when faced with uncertainty. This interaction between motor preparation and the error-driven learning system may facilitate new probes into mechanisms underlying trial-by-trial adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3006058239,"The ability to create and investigate composite fermionic phases opens new avenues for the investigation of strongly correlated quantum matter. We report the experimental observation of a series of quantized conductance steps within strongly interacting electron waveguides formed at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. The waveguide conductance follows a characteristic sequence within Pascal's triangle: $(1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...)\cdot e^2/h$, where $e$ is the electron charge and $h$ is the Planck constant. The robustness of these steps with respect to magnetic field and gate voltage indicate the formation of a new family of degenerate quantum liquids formed from bound states of $n = 2, 3, 4, ...$ electrons. These experiments could provide solid-state analogues for a wide range of composite fermionic phases ranging from neutron stars to solid-state materials to quark-gluon plasmas."
https://openalex.org/W3006138011,"Objectives Despite the growing pieces of evidence linking hyperuricemia with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, the relationship between dyslipidemia and serum uric acid has not yet been established. This study aimed to investigate the association between individual components of dyslipidemia and serum uric acid by using the nationally representative Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2016–2017. Methods A total of 8,722 participants (age ≥ 19 years) without missing values were analyzed for this study. Serum uric acid levels according to the presence of individual dyslipidemia components were calculated using multivariable-adjusted general linear models (GLM). Odds ratios of individual dyslipidemia components to hyperuricemia were calculated using unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 1,061 participants were identified as having hyperuricemia, with a prevalence of 12.2%. Multivariable-adjusted GLM demonstrated a significant trend between individual dyslipidemia components and serum uric acid levels (P < 0.05). A positive association between the numbers of dyslipidemia components and the increments of serum uric acid levels was also observed (P < 0.001). In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of all dyslipidemia components to hyperuricemia were shown to be statistically significant (P < 0.05). When further adjusted for the combined components themselves, each 10 mg/dL increments of total cholesterol (OR 1.053; 95% CI 1.028–1.079), triglycerides (OR 1.017; 95% CI 1.009–1.026) and HDL-C (OR 0.804; 95% CI 0.729–0.887), retained significant correlation with hyperuricemia. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the dyslipidemia components of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-C levels are positively associated with serum uric acid levels, whereas serum HDL-C levels are inversely related. Further complementary studies regarding other lipid parameters are needed to confirm the accurate association between dyslipidemia and serum uric acid levels."
https://openalex.org/W3005708697,"Unveiling the mechanism of action of a drug is key to understand the benefits and adverse reactions of a medication in an organism. However, in complex diseases such as heart diseases there is not a unique mechanism of action but a wide range of different responses depending on the patient. Exploring this collection of mechanisms is one of the clues for a future personalized medicine. The Therapeutic Performance Mapping System (TPMS) is a Systems Biology approach that generates multiple models of the mechanism of action of a drug. Each molecular mechanism generated could be associated to particular individuals, here defined as prototype-patients, hence the generation of models using TPMS technology may be used for detecting adverse effects to specific patients. TPMS operates by (1) modelling the responses in humans with an accurate description of a protein network and (2) applying a Multilayer Perceptron-like and sampling strategy to find all plausible solutions. In the present study, TPMS is applied to explore the diversity of mechanisms of action of the drug combination sacubitril/valsartan. We use TPMS to generate a wide range of models explaining the relationship between sacubitril/valsartan and heart failure (the indication), as well as evaluating their association with macular degeneration (a potential adverse effect). Among the models generated, we identify a set of mechanisms of action associated to a better response in terms of heart failure treatment, which could also be associated to macular degeneration development. Finally, a set of 30 potential biomarkers are proposed to identify mechanisms (or prototype-patients) more prone of suffering macular degeneration when presenting good heart failure response. All prototype-patients models generated are completely theoretical and therefore they do not necessarily involve clinical effects in real patients.

https://openalex.org/W3006395403,"This research aimed to propose a newly-mixed control chart called the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average—Moving Average Chart (EWMA-MA) to detect the mean change in a process underlying symmetric and asymmetric distributions. The performance of the proposed control chart are compared with Shewhart, MA, EWMA, MA-EWMA and EWMA-MA control charts by using average run length (ARL), standard deviation of run length (SDRL), and median run length (MRL) as the criteria for measuring efficiency which evaluated by using Monte Carlo simulation (MC), Moreover, the proposed control chart will be applied to real data. The results of performance comparison showed that the presented control charts performed better detection than the Shewhart, MA, and EWMA charts. However, the results of detection tended to be slower than those for the MA-EWMA chart. The value of ARL1 for the mixed control chart depends on the parameters of the statistics for such control chart. The EWMA-MA chart is a variable following λ and the MA-EWMA chart is varied according to w. From applying the proposed control chart to the data for flow in the Nile River and data of the real GDP growth (%) in the Lebanese economy, it was found to be in accordance with the research results."
https://openalex.org/W3005854341,"NOTCH receptor signaling plays a pivotal role in liver homeostasis and hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the role of NOTCH pathway mutations and the NOTCH target gene HES5 in liver tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing of 54 human HCC specimens and compared the prevalence of NOTCH pathway component mutations with the TCGA-LIHC cohort (N = 364). In addition, we functionally characterized the NOTCH target HES5 and the patient-derived HES5-R31G mutation in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model applying different oncogenic backgrounds, to dissect the role of HES5 in different tumor subgroups in vivo. We identified nonsynonymous mutations in 14 immediate NOTCH pathway genes affecting 24.1% and 16.8% of HCC patients in the two independent cohorts, respectively. Among these, the HES5-R31G mutation was predicted in silico to have high biological relevance. Functional analyses in cell culture showed that HES5 reduced cell migration and clonogenicity. Further analyses revealed that the patient-derived HES5-R31G mutant protein was non-functional due to loss of DNA binding and greatly reduced nuclear localization. Furthermore, HES5 exhibited a negative feedback loop by directly inhibiting the NOTCH target HES1 and downregulated the pro-proliferative MYC targets ODC1 and LDHA. Interestingly, HES5 inhibited MYC-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas it promoted AKT-dependent liver tumor formation and stem cell features in a murine model. Thus, NOTCH pathway component mutations are commonly observed in HCC. Furthermore, the NOTCH target gene HES5 has both pro- and anti-tumorigenic functions in liver cancer proposing a driver gene dependency and it promotes tumorigenesis with its interaction partner AKT."
https://openalex.org/W3006601480,"Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) can evoke cardioprotection following ischemia/reperfusion and this may depend on the anesthetic used. We tested whether 1) extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from humans undergoing RIPC protect cardiomyoblasts against hypoxia-induced apoptosis and 2) this effect is altered by cardiomyoblast exposure to isoflurane or propofol. EVs were isolated before and 60 min after RIPC or Sham from ten patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery with isoflurane anesthesia and quantified by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. Following EV-treatment for 6 hours under exposure of isoflurane or propofol, rat H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were cultured for 18 hours in normoxic or hypoxic atmospheres. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Serum nanoparticle concentrations in patients had increased sixty minutes after RIPC compared to Sham (2.5x1011±4.9x1010 nanoparticles/ml; Sham: 1.2x1011±2.0x1010; p = 0.04). Hypoxia increased apoptosis of H9c2 cells (hypoxia: 8.4%±0.6; normoxia: 2.5%±0.1; p<0.0001). RIPC-EVs decreased H9c2 cell apoptosis compared to control (apoptotic ratio: 0.83; p = 0.0429) while Sham-EVs showed no protection (apoptotic ratio: 0.97). Prior isoflurane exposure in vitro even increased protection (RIPC-EVs/control, apoptotic ratio: 0.79; p = 0.0035; Sham-EVs/control, apoptotic ratio:1.04) while propofol (50μM) abrogated protection by RIPC-EVs (RIPC-EVs/control, Apoptotic ratio: 1.01; Sham-EVs/control, apoptotic ratio: 0.94; p = 0.602). Thus, EVs isolated from patients undergoing RIPC under isoflurane anesthesia protect H9c2 cardiomyoblasts against hypoxia-evoked apoptosis and this effect is abrogated by propofol. This supports a role of human RIPC-generated EVs in cardioprotection and underlines propofol as a possible confounder in RIPC-signaling mediated by EVs."

When the intramembrane cholesterol level becomes sufficient, cholesterol binds to SCAP luminal loop 1 to promote its dissociation from luminal loop 7. This dissociation alters SCAP's conformation and blocks access to the COPII vesicle, thereby inhibiting SREBP2 activation in the Golgi (7Zhang Y. Lee K.M. Kinch L.N. Clark L. Grishin N.V.

Intriguingly, we noticed a conserved sequence between SCAP and the RNF5-interacting domain of STING (Fig. S1B) (14Zhong B. Zhang L. Lei C. Li Y. Mao A.P. Yang Y. Wang Y.Y. Zhang X.L. Shu H.B. The ubiquitin ligase RNF5 regulates antiviral responses by mediating degradation of the adaptor protein MITA.Immunity. 2009; 30 (19285439): 397-40710.1016/j.immuni.2009.01.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), which prompted us to examine the interaction between RNF5 and SCAP. To determine whether RNF5 is associated with SCAP, we performed anti-RNF5 immunoprecipitation (IP) using human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and HuH-7. We found that SCAP was co-precipitated with RNF5 in both HuH-7 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, interactions between HA-SCAP and Myc-RNF5, HA-SCAP and FLAG-RNF5, and FLAG-SCAP and Myc-RNF5 were confirmed by anti-HA, anti-FLAG, and anti-Myc IP experiments, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D; Fig. S1C). These results demonstrate a clear interaction between RNF5 and SCAP. We noticed that Insig1 was quite easily detected in HuH-7 but nearly undetectable in HepG2 cells, whereas Insig2 was highly expressed in HepG2 but nearly undetectable in HuH-7 cells (Fig. S1D). Because RNF5-SCAP interaction was found in both cell lines, it is suggested that either both Insigs play a complementary role in RNF5-SCAP interaction or Insigs are not involved. To address this, we performed IP experiments using an Insig-deficient Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell line, SRD-15 (22Lee P.C. Sever N. Debose-Boyd R.A. Isolation of sterol-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells with genetic deficiencies in both Insig-1 and Insig-2.J. Biol.

We found that Myc-SCAP was co-precipitated with FLAG-RNF5 even in the absence of Insigs (Fig. 1E). This indicates that the RNF5-SCAP interaction is independent of Insigs. To define the subcellular localization of the RNF5-SCAP complex, we conducted cell fractionation by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation. We found that, as described in previous studies (12Younger J.M. Chen L. Ren H.Y. Rosser M.F. Turnbull E.L. Fan C.Y. Patterson C. Cyr D.M. Sequential quality-control checkpoints triage misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.Cell. 2006; 26 (16901789): 571-58210.1016/j.cell.2006.06.041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 14Zhong B.

Sterol-dependent ER-to-Golgi movement plays a key role in SCAP function; however, whether RNF5 can also be transported to the Golgi is unknown. To address this, we performed cell fractionation experiments on HuH-7 cells cultured in sterol-depleted or sterol-loaded medium. We found that, when cells were cultured in sterol-depleted medium, SCAP was detected predominantly in the Golgi fractions, whereas RNF5 remained in the ER fractions (Fig. 1G). To further validate the RNF5-SCAP interaction in the ER, we next performed immunofluorescence staining using antibodies to ER markers (KDEL or calnexin) and to Golgi markers (GM130 or Golgin-97) on HeLa, HEK293, or HuH-7 cells co-transfected with EGFP-SCAP and mCherry-RNF5. We found that when HeLa cells were cultured in complete medium supplemented with 10% FBS, both SCAP and RNF5 co-localized predominantly with an ER marker (KDEL), not with a Golgi marker (GM130) (Fig. 1, H and I). Similarly, in HuH-7 and HEK293 cells cultured in complete medium, RNF5 and a majority of SCAP were found in the ER (Fig. S2). On the other hand, incubating cells in cholesterol-depleted medium caused translocation of SCAP, but not RNF5, to the Golgi (Fig. S2F), which is consistent with our fractionation experiments (Fig. 1G). These findings indicate that RNF5 interacted with SCAP on the ER membrane but was not co-transported with SCAP to the Golgi when cellular sterol level becomes insufficient. To investigate the function of RNF5, we performed siRNA knockdown (KD) experiments in HuH-7 cells. First, we examined whether RNF5 KD rescued proteasomal degradation of SCAP degradation induced by Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG treatment (8Kuan Y.C. Hashidume T. Shibata T. Uchida K. Shimizu M. Inoue J. Sato R. Heat shock protein 90 modulates lipid homeostasis by regulating the stability and function of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and SREBP cleavage-activating protein.J. Biol.

However, we found that although MG132 rescued SCAP from 17-AAG–induced degradation (Fig. S3A), RNF5 KD had no effect on the SCAP protein level (Fig. S3B). This result suggests that RNF5 is not involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of SCAP. This finding is similar to that in a previous report showing that RNF145, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitinated SCAP to inhibit SREBP2 rather than inducing SCAP degradation (23Zhang L. Rajbhandari P. Priest C. Sandhu J. Wu X. Temel R. Castrillo A. de Aguiar Vallim T.Q. Sallam T. Tontonoz P. Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis through RNF145-dependent ubiquitination of SCAP.eLife. 2017; 6 (29068315): e2876610.7554/eLife.28766Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that RNF5 KD decreased the matured form of SREBP2, whereas the overexpression of RNF5 had the opposite effect (Fig. 2A). We also examined another three different RNF5 siRNAs and found that RNF5 KD decreased the amount of matured SREBP2 (Fig. 2B). Notably, when the cells were treated with 25-hydroxylcholesterol (25-HC), a strong inhibitor of SREBP processing, RNF5 KD no longer reduced the protein level of matured SREBP2 (Fig. 2B). In addition, to rule out the influence of SREBP self-regulation, we showed that RNF5 KD decreased the matured form of overexpressed His-tagged SREBP2 whose transcription was controlled by a cytomegalovirus promoter (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that RNF5 positively regulates SREBP2 activation. We then examined the effect of RNF5 KD on SREBP2-target gene expression. We found that the mRNA levels of HMGCS, HMGCR, and SQS were significantly down-regulated by RNF5 KD (Fig. 2D). The protein level of HMGCR as well as acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, an SREBP1 target gene was also drastically reduced by RNF5 KD, whereas the protein level of fatty acid synthase was less affected by RNF5 KD (Fig. 2E). Although 25-HC treatment also led to the proteasomal degradation of HMGCR (24Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Accelerated degradation of HMG CoA reductase mediated by binding of insig-1 to its sterol-sensing domain.Mol.

To determine the physiological outcome of RNF5 KD, we measured the total cellular cholesterol content of HuH-7 cells. We found that total cholesterol in the cells was significantly decreased by about 20% in RNF5 KD cells (Fig. 2F). Moreover, using [14C] radioisotope-labeled acetic acid, we quantified the amount of de novo synthesized cholesterol in HuH-7 cells. De novo cholesterol synthesis was reduced by more than 60% in RNF5 KD cells, whereas treatment of 25-HC, a strong inhibitor of SREBP processing and an HMGCR degrader, led to even more significant suppression of cholesterol synthesis (Fig. 2G). To understand how RNF5 affects SREBP2 activation by interacting with SCAP, we first examined whether RNF5 mediated the ubiquitination of SCAP. Cells of the SCAP-deficient CHO cell line SRD13A (6Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Failure to cleave sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) causes cholesterol auxotrophy in Chinese hamster ovary cells with genetic absence of SREBP cleavage-activating protein.J. Biol.

We found an RNF5-dependent increase of polyubiquitinated SCAP (Fig. 3A). This polyubiquitination was not observed when a C42S mutant RNF5 that had lost its E3 activity (14Zhong B. Zhang L. Lei C. Li Y. Mao A.P. Yang Y. Wang Y.Y. Zhang X.L. Shu H.B. The ubiquitin ligase RNF5 regulates antiviral responses by mediating degradation of the adaptor protein MITA.Immunity. 2009; 30 (19285439): 397-40710.1016/j.immuni.2009.01.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) was transfected (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that RNF5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the polyubiquitination of SCAP. It has been reported that RNF5 induced the Lys-48–linked polyubiquitination of STING, leading to its degradation (14Zhong B. Zhang L. Lei C. Li Y. Mao A.P. Yang Y. Wang Y.Y. Zhang X.L. Shu H.B. The ubiquitin ligase RNF5 regulates antiviral responses by mediating degradation of the adaptor protein MITA.Immunity. 2009; 30 (19285439): 397-40710.1016/j.immuni.2009.01.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AMFR/gp78 induced the Lys-27–linked polyubiquitination of STING to activate downstream signaling (18Wang Q. Liu X. Cui Y. Tang Y. Chen W. Li S. Yu H. Pan Y. Wang C. The E3 ubiquitin ligase AMFR and INSIG1 bridge the activation of TBK1 kinase by modifying the adaptor STING.Immunity. 2014; 41 (25526307): 919-93310.1016/j.immuni.2014.11.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It was essential to determine which kind of polyubiquitination was induced by RNF5 on SCAP. To this end, we generated seven HA-ubiquitin plasmids that carried an arginine mutation at lysine residue Lys-6, Lys-11, Lys-27, Lys-29, Lys-33, Lys-48, or Lys-63 to perform SCAP ubiquitination experiments. We found that RNF5 failed to induce the polyubiquitination of SCAP when Lys-29 of ubiquitin was mutated (Fig. 3C). This indicates that Lys-29 was crucial for RNF5-induced SCAP polyubiquitination, whereas other lysine residues were dispensable. To confirm this finding, we generated two other HA-ubiquitin mutant plasmids, one with all of the lysines mutated to arginine (Lys-0) and the other with all but the Lys-29 lysine residue mutated to arginine (Lys-29). We found that RNF5 induced Lys-29–ubiquitin to form a polyubiquitin chain on SCAP, whereas no polyubiquitination was observed with Lys-0–ubiquitin (Fig. 3D). Taking these findings together, we revealed that RNF5 mediated the Lys-29–linked polyubiquitination of SCAP. Next, we began to identify the site where RNF5-induced polyubiquitination occurred. There are 18 cytosolic lysine residues in human SCAP that were possible ubiquitination sites (Fig. S4A). We generated 14 SCAP mutants that carried an arginine mutation at one or two lysine residues located in the cytosolic loops or the N-terminal or C-terminal cytosolic domains of SCAP. We found that arginine mutation at Lys-305 located in cytosolic loop 2 of SCAP drastically impaired RNF5-induced polyubiquitination, whereas mutations of Lys-310 and Lys-312 in the same loop had no effect (Fig. 4A). Mutation of lysine in cytosolic loop 4 and loop 6 did not affect the RNF5-induced polyubiquitination of SCAP. Arginine mutation at the Lys-10 lysine residue located in the N-terminal cytosolic domain and other lysine residues located in the C-terminal cytosolic domain had no influence on RNF5-induced polyubiquitination of SCAP (Fig. S4B). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Lys-305 lysine residue is essential for the RNF5-mediated polyubiquitination of SCAP. Because lysine Lys-305 is located in loop 2 flanked by transmembrane domains TM2 and TM3 (Fig. S4A), we examined whether RNF5 binds to nearby regions of loop 2. We generated full-length, TM1–6, TM1–3, TM1–2, and TM4–C-terminal truncated versions of FLAG-SCAP (Fig. 4B) to study their binding to RNF5 by anti-FLAG IP. We found that RNF5 was co-precipitated with full-length SCAP as well as TM1–6, TM1–3, and TM1–2 of SCAP (Fig. 4C, full-length (FL) and no. 1–3), but not with TM4-C-terminal of SCAP (Fig. 4C, no. 4). We also noticed that the amino acid sequence of SCAP TM2–3 shares 58% similarity with RNF5-binding domain of STING (Fig. 4D). Taking these findings together, we revealed that RNF5 binds to a region near loop 2 and ubiquitinates Lys-305 of SCAP. To study the relationship between RNF5-induced SCAP polyubiquitination and RNF5-mediated SREB2 activation, we transfected WT or K305R mutant SCAP into SCAP-deficient SRD-13A cells and examined the effect on SREBP activation. We found that the expression levels of WT and K305R SCAP were quite comparable and they had similar abilities to stabilize precursor SREBPs (Fig. 5A). Intriguingly, judging from the amount of N-terminal matured form of SREBPs, although WT SCAP rescued SREBP activation, K305R mutation of SCAP drastically impaired SREBP activation (Fig. 5A). To determine the physiological outcome of K305R mutation in SCAP, we generated a SCAP-knockout (KO) HEK293 cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system following a previously published method (26Shao W. Machamer C.E. Espenshade P.J. Fatostatin blocks ER exit of SCAP but inhibits cell growth in a SCAP-independent manner.J. Lipid Res. 2016; 57 (2732479): 1564-157310.1194/jlr.M069583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SCAP was undetectable in the SCAP-KO HEK293 cell line, and the protein level of SREBP was drastically reduced (Fig. S5A), which led to 30–50% down-regulation of SREBP target genes compared with that in a control cell line that expressed Cas9 (Fig. S5B). We named the SCAP-KO and Cas9 control HEK293 cell lines KY6 and Cas9, respectively. When we transfected matured SREBP2, or WT or K305R mutant SCAP into KY6 cells, we found that exogenous SREBP2 and WT SCAP, but not K305R-mutant SCAP, restored SREBP target gene expression to a level comparable with that of Cas9 cells (Fig. 5B). These experiments demonstrate that Lys-305 polyubiquitination of SCAP is crucial for SREBP2 activation. SREBP activation is tightly regulated by the interaction between cholesterol and SCAP. When the cholesterol level in the ER membrane rises, cholesterol binds to luminal loop (L1) of SCAP, causing the dissociation of L1 from L7. The separation of L1 and L7 results in a conformational change that hides the ER exit signal “MELADL” sequence and allows Insig binding of SCAP; both actions lead to ER retention of SCAP-SREBP complex and obstruction of SREBP processing (27Brown M.S. Radhakrishnan A. Goldstein J.L. Retrospective on cholesterol homeostasis: The central role of Scap.Annu. Rev.

We noticed that Lys-305 is located at the junction of TM2 and loop2 and hypothesized that the ubiquitination of Lys-305 helped SCAP to assume an L1-L7–bound conformation. To test this assumption, we took advantage of an experimental system developed by the Brown and Goldstein laboratory (7Zhang Y. Lee K.M. Kinch L.N. Clark L. Grishin N.V. Rosenbaum D.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Radhakrishnan A. Direct demonstration that loop1 of Scap binds to loop7: A crucial event in cholesterol homeostasis.J. Biol.

SRD-13A cells were transfected with FLAG-L1 and Myc-L7, and L1-L7 binding was assessed by anti-Myc IP. We observed L1-L7 interaction as expected (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–4). Intriguingly, co-transfection of RNF5 dose-dependently enhanced L1-L7 binding (Fig. 6A, lanes 4–6). This finding supports our hypothesis, so we went on and examined whether ubiquitination was involved in the regulation of L1-L7"

In recent years, in vitro amplification assays have been developed that can detect CWD prion seeding activity in tissues, excreta, and body fluids of affected cervids. These methods potentially offer earlier and more facile detection of CWD, both pre- and post-mortem. Here we provide a longitudinal profile of CWD infection progression, as assessed by both real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and IHC on serial biopsies of mucosal lymphoid tissues of white-tailed deer orally exposed to low doses of CWD prions. We report that detection of CWD infection by RT-QuIC preceded that by IHC in both tonsil and recto-anal lymphoid tissue (RAMALT) in 14 of 19 deer (74%). Of the 322 biopsy samples collected in post-exposure longitudinal monitoring, positive RT-QuIC results were obtained for 146 samples, 91 of which (62%) were concurrently also IHC-positive. The lower frequency of IHC positivity was manifest most in the earlier post-exposure periods and in biopsies in which lymphoid follicles were not detected. For all deer in which RT-QuIC seeding activity was detected in a tonsil or RAMALT biopsy, PrPCWD was subsequently or concurrently detected by IHC. Overall, this study (a) provides a longitudinal profile of CWD infection in deer after low yet infectious oral prion exposure; (b) illustrates the value of RT-QuIC for sensitive detection of CWD; and (c) demonstrates an ultimate high degree of correlation between RT-QuIC and IHC positivity as CWD infection progresses."
https://openalex.org/W3006007721,"Epigenetic mechanisms are known to regulate gene expression during chondrogenesis. In this study, we have characterized the epigenome during the in vitro differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into chondrocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to assess a range of N-terminal posttranscriptional modifications (marks) to histone H3 lysines (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3) in both hMSCs and differentiated chondrocytes. Chromatin states were characterized using histone ChIP-seq and cis-regulatory elements were identified in chondrocytes. Chondrocyte enhancers were associated with chondrogenesis-related gene ontology (GO) terms. In silico analysis and integration of DNA methylation data with chondrogenesis chromatin states revealed that enhancers marked by histone marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were de-methylated during in vitro chondrogenesis. Similarity analysis between hMSC and chondrocyte chromatin states defined in this study with epigenomes of cell-types defined by the Roadmap Epigenomics project revealed that enhancers are more distinct between cell-types compared to other chromatin states. Motif analysis revealed that the transcription factor SOX9 is enriched in chondrocyte enhancers. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that chondrocyte enhancers characterized in this study exhibited enhancer activity which may be modulated by DNA methylation and SOX9 overexpression. Altogether, these integrated data illustrate the cross-talk between different epigenetic mechanisms during chondrocyte differentiation."

In addition to their industrial relevance, understanding the molecular mechanism of GH45-catalyzed hydrolysis is of fundamental importance because of their structural similarity to cell wall–modifying enzymes such as bacterial lytic transglycosylases (LTs) and expansins present in bacteria, plants, and fungi. Our understanding of the catalytic itinerary of GH45s has been incomplete because a crystal structure with substrate spanning the −1 to +1 subsites is currently lacking. Here we constructed and validated a putative Michaelis complex in silico and used it to elucidate the hydrolytic mechanism in a GH45, Cel45A from the fungus Humicola insolens, via unbiased simulation approaches. These molecular simulations revealed that the solvent-exposed active-site architecture results in lack of coordination for the hydroxymethyl group of the substrate at the −1 subsite. This lack of coordination imparted mobility to the hydroxymethyl group and enabled a crucial hydrogen bond with the catalytic acid during and after the reaction. This suggests the possibility of a nonhydrolytic reaction mechanism when the catalytic base aspartic acid is missing, as is the case in some LTs (murein transglycosylase A) and expansins.

Biochemical experiments on HiCel45A revealed that HiCel45A hydrolyzes glycosidic bonds in cellulo-oligomers via a one-step inverting mechanism. Point mutations to three candidate aspartic acid residues (D121A, D10A, and D114A) at the putative active site implicated Asp-121 (proton donor) and Asp-10 (catalytic base) as indispensable catalytic residues for hydrolytic activity in HiCel45A (5Davies G.J.

Cocrystallization of HiCel45A with cellohexaose yielded a structure with two cellotriose molecules occupying subsites −4 to −2 and +1 to +3. However, no sugar occupancy was observed at the −1 subsite in this structure (Fig. 1A) nor in any published structure of a member of subfamily A (5Davies G.J. Tolley S.P. Henrissat B. Hjort C.

Given that the enzyme hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond between the −1 and +1 binding sites, the absence of the substrate at the −1 subsite leaves a gap in our understanding of the GH45 catalytic itinerary.

Although catalytic activity in most cellulases (including GH45s) is mediated by a proton donor and a base (usually an aspartate or glutamate dyad (19Davies G. Henrissat B.

As illustrated in Fig. 1B, MltA and expansins share the conserved HFD domain (20Sampedro J. Cosgrove D.J.

Given the catalytic machinery of HiCel45A for conventional hydrolysis, its well-characterized biochemistry, and its active-site similarity (conserved HFD domain) with GH45 subfamily C, we posit that mechanistic details of GH45A hydrolysis will lead us to insights into plausible modes of catalysis where the base aspartate is mutated, which could also be widely applicable to other cell wall–modifying proteins with a similar active-site architecture. Although crystal structures provide static pictures of long-lived states, molecular simulations provide the requisite spatiotemporal resolution necessary for elucidating atomistic and dynamic details of reaction mechanisms. Though many simulation techniques applied to chemical reactions require a priori specification of the reaction coordinate (RC), which quantifies dynamic progress from reactant to product, transition path sampling (TPS) produces an unbiased ensemble of trajectories (23Peters B. Reaction coordinates and mechanistic hypothesis tests.Annu. Rev. Phys.

These studies enabled key insights into the RC, free energy barriers for the reactions, sugar puckering itineraries, and rate-limiting steps in these important cellobiohydrolases. In this study, we employ TPS to elucidate the hydrolysis mechanism in the inverting endoglucanase HiCel45A. We begin by constructing and validating a Michaelis complex (MC) in silico. Subsequent quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) TPS simulations result in determination of the RC for hydrolysis by WT HiCel45A. In addition, insights gained from the WT hydrolysis mechanism form the basis for an LT-like nonhydrolytic mechanism for the HiCel45A D10N mutant, where the catalytic base aspartic acid is mutated to asparagine. Computed free energy barriers demonstrate the feasibility of the nonhydrolytic mechanism which could serve as a critical segue to understanding mechanistic action in LTs and expansins. The MC in HiCel45A has not yet been structurally characterized. To construct a model MC for HiCel45A, we began with the crystal structure featuring two cellotriose molecules occupying subsites −4 to −2 and +1 to +3 (PDB code 4ENG) and connected these via the sugar occupying the −1 site from another inverting GH, Thermobifida fusca Cel6A (TfCel6A, PDB code 4AVO) (26Wu M.

Unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were analyzed for simultaneous satisfaction of all three criteria, starting from the constructed HiCel45A MC, and each frame was categorized as catalytically competent (all above criteria met) or not competent for catalysis (any one or more criteria not met). Of the five independent MD runs, one simulation demonstrated catalytically competent conformations 54.5% of the time. There, the catalytically competent conformations were stable over tens to hundreds of picoseconds, timescales beyond what would be required for a single hydrolytic event (Fig. S3). This result provides sufficient confidence in the stability of the putative MC for more detailed studies of the hydrolysis reaction mechanism. Further analysis of the equilibrium MD simulations reveals that the hydroxymethyl group of the substrate ring at the −1 position is not coordinated by specific direct interactions with the protein, although a hydrogen bond with an active site water is observed (˜14% occupancy over 100 ns simulation). This differs from TfCel6A, where the oxygen atom on the hydroxymethyl group of the substrate ring bound at the −1 subsite in GH6 coordinates closely with an active-site tyrosine to maintain its puckered conformation in the MC (29Larsson A.M.

Crystal structure of Thermobifida fusca endoglucanase Cel6A in complex with substrate and inhibitor: the role of tyrosine Y73 in substrate ring distortion.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (16185060): 12915-1292210.1021/bi0506730Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This has implications in the reaction mechanism in the absence of the catalytic base, as described in subsequent sections. The important enzyme–substrate interactions observed from MD simulations involve Asp-178, Asp-10, Asn-179, Glu-48, and Trp-18 (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4). The catalytically competent configurations from the simulations described above enabled investigation of the HiCel45A hydrolysis reaction mechanism using QM/MM MD simulations. Fig. 3A depicts snapshots of the reactant, transition state, and product configurations of the system, accompanied by chemical structures depicting the bonds being broken and formed. Note the strained conformation of the substrate ring bound at the −1 subsite in the reactant and transition state conformations and the development of a strong interaction between the hydrogen atom on O6 and the deprotonating oxygen on Asp-121. Movie S1 depicts one of these trajectories. The ensemble of reactive and unreactive trajectories was systematically analyzed to determine the optimal RC. LM analysis determined the optimal RC to include two differences in distances: the difference between the length of the forming and breaking bonds involving the acidic proton and the difference between the length of the forming and breaking bonds involving the anomeric carbon (Fig. 3A and Section S2.2). This RC was validated using the pB histogram test (30Peters B. Using the histogram test to quantify reaction coordinate error.J. Chem. Phys. 2006; 125 (17199332): 24110110.1063/1.2409924Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). In GH enzymes, ring puckering at the active site is an important feature of the catalytic itinerary. Although the 1.5-ps trajectories are long enough to capture bond-breaking phenomena, observations of pucker transitions in the reactant and product basins require longer simulation times. Hence, starting from the ends of a successful reactive trajectory, we also conducted 500-ps QM/MM simulations to evaluate this behavior for the substrate at the −1 subsite pre- and post-reaction (Fig. 3B). The substrate in the reactant state starts near the 2SO region (θcremer-pople (31Cremer D. Pople J.A. General definition of ring puckering coordinates.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 1354-135810.1021/ja00839a011Crossref Scopus (6714) Google Scholar) ˜ 90°) plot and then immediately shifts to the 4C1 (θcremer-pople ˜ 10°) chair state, with the hydroxymethyl and 2, 3, and 4 hydroxyls in equatorial positions. In the product state, the substrate ring at the −1 subsite again starts in the vicinity of the 2SO region and explores various pucker states (θcremer-pople ˜ 90°) before transitioning to the less common 1C4 (θcremer-pople ˜ 180°) state with axial substituents. The elucidation of an optimal RC sets the stage for free energy calculations along the inverting hydrolysis mechanism. During free energy calculations, the sugar pucker in the reactant windows (RC < −1.3) was restrained to 2SO, as this is in analogy with the pucker state observed in GH6, which exhibits similar catalytic machinery (25Mayes H.B. Knott B.C. Crowley M.F. Broadbelt L.J. Ståhlberg J. Beckham G.T. Who's on base? Revealing the catalytic mechanism of inverting family 6 glycoside hydrolases.Chem.

Likewise, product windows (RC > 0.7) were restrained to 1C4, as we observed this to be the stable conformation in the product basin. The resulting free energy profile revealed a slightly endergonic 3.8 ± 1.9 kcal/mol reaction with a barrier of 23.55 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. Analysis of unbiased reactive trajectories reveals that the reaction can be described to occur in two stages: transfer of the proton from Asp-121, accompanied by breakage of the glycosidic bond, and splitting of the water molecule and the nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon, accompanied by transfer of the proton to the base Asp-10 (Fig. 3D). Specifically, in the reactant basin, the hydroxymethyl group of the −1 sugar is not directly coordinated to any active-site residues. Distance analysis between the hydroxymethyl group of the substrate bound at the −1 subsite and the Asp-121 oxygens from 16 reactive trajectories is presented in Fig. 4. As the reaction proceeds, Asp-121 becomes increasingly electronegative. This result, coupled with the proximity and lack of coordination of the hydroxymethyl group, enables close coordination of the C6 hydroxyl hydrogen with the Asp-121 oxygen as indicated by the average distances ˜2 Å in the product state. Hydrogen bond analysis for the 500-ps unrestrained QM/MM MD of the product also reveals the presence of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxymethyl proton and Asp-121 oxygen in 58% of the frames. The active sites of GH45 subfamilies A, B, and C share with MltA and expansins the conserved catalytic acid, but of these, only GH45 subfamilies A and B exhibit the catalytic base at the equivalent position of Asp-10 in HiCel45A. The coordination of the hydroxymethyl proton with the catalytic acid Asp-121 in our simulations of the hydrolysis mechanism in WT HiCel45A suggests the possibility of Asp-121 acting as both acid and base for the reaction in the absence of the WT catalytic base Asp-10. Although experimental characterization of the HiCel45A D10N mutant revealed no hydrolytic activity (5Davies G.J. Tolley S.P. Henrissat B. Hjort C. Schulein M. Structures of oligosaccharide-bound forms of the endoglucanase V from Humicola insolens at 1.9 Å resolution.Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (8519779): 16210-1622010.1021/bi00049a037Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), this does not preclude other catalytic activity in the HiCel45A D10N mutant, similar to MltA or expansins.

In Australia, a high prevalence of vancomycin resistance has been reported in E. faecium in the last decade.In this study, we determined the phylogenetic relationship and genetic characteristics of E. faecium collected from hospitalized patients with blood stream infections throughout Australia from 2015 to 2017 using high throughput molecular techniques.Using single nucleotide polymorphism based phylogenetic inference, three distinct clusters of isolates were observed with additional sub-clustering. One cluster harboured mostly non-CC17 isolates while two clusters were dominant for the vanA and vanB operons.The gradual increase in dominance of the respective van operon was observed in both the vanA and vanB dominant clusters suggesting a strain-van operon affinity. The high prevalence of the van operon within isolates of a particular sub-cluster was linked to an increased number of isolates and 30-day all-cause mortality. Different dominant sub-clusters were observed in each region of Australia. Findings from this study can be used to put future surveillance data into a broader perspective including the detection of novel E. faecium strains in Australia as well as the dissemination and evolution of each strain."

Given the uniqueness of the one-child policy in China, this study examined the existence of the RAE in elite Chinese male and female soccer players generally and relative to their playing position on the field. Results showed a clear and obvious RAE for all age groups (U20 male, U18 male, adult female and U18 female) with the observed birthdate distributions for each age group significantly different from expected distributions (p<0.05). Additionally, we noticed a differential RAE according to the players’ position on the field as reflected in different effect sizes. In male players, the RAE was significantly greater in Defenders (DF) and Goalkeepers (GK) compared to Midfielders (MF) and Forwards (FW) (VDF = 0.266>VGK = 0.215>VMF = 0.178>VFW = 0.175). In female players, GKs had a larger RAE (VGK = 0.184>0.17, VDF = 0.143, VMF = 0.127, VFW = 0.116). To reduce the negative consequences associated with RAEs throughout player development systems, potential solutions are discussed."

Allelic and genotypic frequencies of these SNPs deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P < 0.05). SNP1 genotype GG, SNP2 genotype CT and SNP3 genotype AT showed significantly (P <0.05) larger body measurement and improved carcass quality traits. Haplotype H1 (GCA) showed significantly (p<0.01) higher transcriptional activity (51.44%) followed by H4 (ATT) (34.13%) in bovine preadipocytes. The diplotypes HI-H3 (GG-CC-AT), H1-H2 (GG-CT-AT) and H3-H4 (GA-CT-TT) showed significant (P<0.01) associations with body measurement and improved carcass quality traits. Analysis of the relative mRNA expression level of the TORC2 gene in different tissues within two different age groups revealed a significant increase (P<0.01) in liver, small intestine, muscle and fat tissues with growth from calf stage to adult stage. We can conclude that variants mapped within TORC2 can be used in marker-assisted selection for carcass quality and body measurement traits in breed improvement programs of Qinchuan cattle."
https://openalex.org/W3005828485,"This paper introduces distributional regression also known as generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) as a modeling framework for analyzing treatment effects beyond the mean. In contrast to mean regression models, GAMLSS relate each distributional parameter to covariates. Therefore, they can be used to model the treatment effect not only on the mean but on the whole conditional distribution. Since they encompass a wide range of different distributions, GAMLSS provide a flexible framework for modeling non-normal outcomes in which additionally nonlinear and spatial effects can easily be incorporated. We elaborate on the combination of GAMLSS with program evaluation methods including randomized controlled trials, panel data techniques, difference in differences, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity design. We provide practical guidance on the usage of GAMLSS by reanalyzing data from the Mexican Progresa program. Contrary to expectations, no significant effects of a cash transfer on the conditional consumption inequality level between treatment and control group are found."

In this report, we analyzed TFR2-deficient mice in the presence or absence of iron overload to distinguish between the effects caused by a high iron load and those caused by loss of TFR2 function. Analysis of bone marrow from TFR2-deficient mice revealed a reduction in the early burst-forming unit–erythroid and an expansion of late-stage erythroblasts that was independent of iron overload. Spleens of TFR2-deficient mice displayed an increase in colony-forming unit–erythroid progenitors and in all erythroblast populations regardless of iron overload. This expansion of the erythroid compartment coincided with increased erythroferrone (ERFE) expression and serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels. Rescue of hepatic TFR2 expression normalized hepcidin expression and the total cell count of the bone marrow and spleen, but it had no effect on erythroid progenitor frequency. On the basis of these results, we propose a model of TFR2’s function in murine erythropoiesis, indicating that deficiency in this receptor is associated with increased erythroid development and expression of EPO and ERFE in extrahepatic tissues independent of TFR’s role in the liver.

https://openalex.org/W3006012737,"Adipose tissue development begins in utero and is a key target of developmental programming. Here the influence of nutritionally-mediated prenatal growth-restriction on perirenal adipose tissue (PAT) gene expression and adipocyte phenotype in late fetal life was investigated in both sexes in an ovine model. Likewise circulating leptin concentrations and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and glycerol responses to glucose challenge were determined in relation to offspring adiposity at key stages from birth to mid-adult life. In both studies’ singleton-bearing adolescent sheep were fed control or high nutrient intakes to induce normal or growth-restricted pregnancies, respectively. Fetal growth-restriction at day 130 of gestation (32% lighter) was characterised by greater body-weight-specific PAT mass and higher PAT expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARɤ), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and uncoupling protein 1. Independent of prenatal growth, females had a greater body-weight-specific PAT mass, more multilocular adipocytes, higher leptin and lower insulin-like growth factor 1 mRNA than males. Growth-restricted offspring of both sexes (42% lighter at birth) were characterised by higher plasma NEFA concentrations across the life-course (post-fasting and after glucose challenge at 7, 32, 60, 85 and 106 weeks of age) consistent with reduced adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. Circulating plasma leptin correlated with body fat percentage (females>males) and restricted compared with normal females had more body fat and increased abundance of PPARɤ, HSL, leptin and adiponectin mRNA in PAT at necropsy (109 weeks). Therefore, prenatal nutrient supply and sex both influence adipose tissue development with consequences for lipid metabolism and body composition persisting throughout the life-course."
https://openalex.org/W3005993270,"Liver regeneration after injury requires fine-tune regulation of connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf). It also involves dynamic expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (Hnf)4α, Yes-associated protein (Yap), and transforming growth factor (Tgf)-β. The upstream inducers of Ctgf, such as Yap, etc, are well-known. However, the negative regulator of Ctgf remains unclear. Here, we investigated the Hnf4α regulation of Ctgf post-various types of liver injury. Both wild-type animals and animals contained siRNA-mediated Hnf4α knockdown and Cre-mediated Ctgf conditional deletion were used. We observed that Ctgf induction was associated with Hnf4α decline, nuclear Yap accumulation, and Tgf-β upregulation during early stage of liver regeneration. The Ctgf promoter contained an Hnf4α binding sequence that overlapped with the cis-regulatory element for Yap and Tgf-β. Ctgf loss attenuated inflammation, hepatocyte proliferation, and collagen synthesis, whereas Hnf4α knockdown enhanced Ctgf induction and liver fibrogenesis. These findings provided a new mechanism about fine-tuned regulation of Ctgf through Hnf4α antagonism of Yap and Tgf-β activities to balance regenerative and fibrotic signals."

It has been found that WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2 (WISP-2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) are involved in cell apoptosis. In this study, we performed the straight-leg swaddling DDH rat model and we found that cartilage degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis were remarkably increased in DDH rats in vivo. Moreover, we found that WISP-2 was upregulated in hip acetabular cartilage of DDH rats compared to control rats. Next, the effects of WISP-2 on chondrocyte apoptosis and its possible underlying mechanism were examined in vitro. The lentivirus-mediated gain- and loss-of-function experiments of WISP-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) for cell viability and apoptosis were performed in primary rat chondrocytes. The results showed that the overexpression of WISP-2 induced chondrocyte apoptosis, and knockdown of WISP-2 could suppress the chondrocyte apoptosis induced by advanced glycation end products (AGE). Additionally, WISP-2 could negatively regulate the expression of PPARγ in chondrocytes. Moreover, the knockdown of PPARγ promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and overexpression of PPARγ abated the increased apoptosis and decreased cell viability of chondrocytes induced by WISP-2. This study demonstrated that WISP-2 might contribute to chondrocyte apoptosis of hip acetabular cartilage through regulating PPARγ expression and activation, which may play an important role in the development of DDH."

To understand the consequences of mismeasurement, as well as the broader importance of microbial biomass abundance as a direct driver of ecological phenomena, greater quantitative understanding of the role of microbial biomass abundance in environmental processes is needed. Using microcosms, we manipulated the initial biomass of numerous microbial communities across a 100-fold range and measured effects on CO2 production during plant litter decomposition. We found that the effects of initial biomass abundance on CO2 production was largely attenuated within a week, while the effects of community type remained significant over the course of the experiment. Overall, our results suggest that initial microbial biomass abundance in litter decomposition within an ecosystem is a weak driver of long-term C cycling dynamics."

Total 109 significant associations for eight kernel-related traits were detected under a mix linear model, generating 54 unique SNP markers distributed on 13 of 14 chromosomes. Of which, 19 marker-trait associations were identified in two or more environments, including one stable and pleiotropic SNP BE500291_5_A_37 on chromosome 5A correlated with six kernel traits. Although most of our SNP loci were overlapped with the previously known kernel weight QTLs, several novel loci for kernel traits in durum were reported. Correlation analysis implied that the moderate climatic variables during growth and development of durum are needed for the large grain size and high grain weight. Combined with our previous studies, we found that chromosome 5A might play an important role in durum growth and development."

We analyzed data from the third and fourth Korean Working Conditions Survey (KWCS) conducted by the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency in 2011 and 2014. We performed chi-square tests to compare the different baseline and occupational characteristics and mental health status according to occupational dust exposure levels. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for mental health symptoms (fatigue, depression or anxiety, and insomnia or sleep disturbance) were calculated using adjusted multiple logistic regression models. A total of 78,512 participants (43,979 in men, 34,533 in women) were included in this study. Among them, 6,013 (7.7%) and 2,625 (3.3%) reported “moderate” and “severe” dust exposure, respectively. Among those who answered “yes” to depression or anxiety, fatigue, insomnia or sleep disturbance, 50 (4.6%), 961 (4.8%), and 123 (5.9%), respectively, demonstrated “severe” occupational dust exposure. Compared to “low” levels of dust exposure, “moderate” and “severe” exposure increased the risk of depression and anxiety (OR = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.88–1.36; OR = 1.16, 95%CI: 0.87–1.58, per exposure respectively); however, this was not statistically significant. For fatigue, significance was observed for “moderate” 1.54 (1.46–1.64) and “severe” 1.65 (1.52–1.80) exposure levels. “Severe” levels increased the risk of insomnia or sleep disturbance (OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.25–1.85). These results suggest that the “dust annoyance” concept of mental health, which may be explained by a neurocognitive mechanism, is plausible. Occupational “dust annoyance” has been linked to workers’ mental health status, particularly in terms of fatigue and sleep disturbance; a dose-response relationship has been observed. Workers should be protected against dust to support their health and productivity."
https://openalex.org/W3005854773,"In this study, we investigate differences in tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes between urban and rural India and estimate their impact on epidemiological outcomes such as TB incidence, prevalence and mortality using a mathematical model of TB transmission dynamics. Publicly available district-level treatment outcomes data for new and previously treated TB cases was analyzed in conjunction with census data providing the proportion of urban population in each district to determine the effect of urbanity/rurality on treatment outcomes. Districts were grouped in clusters based on the proportion of urban population in each district, wherein the clusters were identified by applying machine learning methods. Regression analyses revealed that average treatment success rates among both new and previously treated cases decline with increase in the proportion of urban population in a district cluster, with substantially sharper declines in treatment success rates with degree of urbanity observed for previously treated cases. The impact of differences in treatment outcomes on epidemiological outcomes was estimated using a dynamic transmission model developed for this purpose. For example, the cluster with highest treatment success rates is projected to have an average of 3.2% fewer deaths per 100,000 population in comparison with the national average across 2019–24, and the cluster with the lowest treatment success rates has an average of 4.5% more deaths per 100,000 in comparison with the national average.

https://openalex.org/W3006136126,"Background Prior to vaccine introduction in 2006, rotavirus was the leading cause of severe diarrhea in children under five years of age in the U.S. Vaccination of infants has led to major reductions in disease burden, a shift in the seasonal peak and the emergence of a biennial pattern of disease. However, rotavirus vaccine coverage has remained relatively low (70-75%) compared to other infant immunizations in the U.S. Part of the reason for this lower coverage is that children whose care is provided by family practitioners (FP) have considerably lower probability of being vaccinated compared to those seen be pediatricians (PE). We used a dynamic transmission model to assess the impact of improving rotavirus vaccine coverage by FP and/or PE on rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) incidence and seasonal patterns. Methods A deterministic age-structured dynamic model with susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments (SIRS model) was used to simulate rotavirus transmission and vaccination. We estimated the reduction of RVGE cases by 2 doses of rotavirus vaccine with three vaccination scenarios: (Status Quo: 85% coverage by pediatricians and 45% coverage by family practitioners; Improved FP: 85% coverage by pediatricians and family practitioners; Improved FP+PE: 95% coverage by pediatricians and family practitioners). In addition, we tested the sensitivity of the model to the assumption of random mixing patterns between children visiting pediatricians and children visiting family practitioners. Results In this model, higher vaccine coverage provided by family practitioners and pediatricians leads to lower incidence of severe RVGE cases (23% averted in Improved FP and 57% averted in Improved FP+PE compared to Status Quo) including indirect effects. One critical impact of higher total vaccine coverage is the effect on rotavirus epidemic patterns in the U.S.; the biennial rotavirus epidemic patterns shifted to reduced annual epidemic patterns. Additionally, assortative mixing patterns in children visiting pediatricians and family practitioners amplify the impact of increasing vaccine coverage. Conclusion Other high-income countries that introduced vaccine have not experienced biennial patterns, like the U.S. Our results suggest that increasing overall vaccine coverage to 85% among infants would lead to an overall reduction in incidence with annual epidemic patterns."

Blood samples were collected from 31 (15 male and 16 female) free-ranging copperheads and 34 (20 male and 14 female) free-ranging ratsnakes at the beginning and end of restraint. Restraint was performed for morphometric measurements, sex determination, and identification via placement of intracelomic passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and marking of ventral scutes with a handheld electrocautery unit. Blood gas analytes were measured at the beginning of restraint and compared to analytes measured at the end to evaluate for changes secondary to handling. Total restraint time prior to the first blood sampling was 1.4 ± 0.4 mins (mean ± SD) and 1.0 ± 0.2 mins (mean ± SD) and restraint time prior to second blood sampling was 12.5 ± 2.4 mins (mean ± SD) and 13.5 ± 3.4 mins (mean ± SD) for copperheads and ratsnakes, respectively. Blood lactate concentrations at the beginning of restraint were similar for both species. Lactate concentrations increased significantly and pH decreased significantly for both species at the end of restraint when compared to the beginning of restraint. Furthermore, lactate concentrations at the end of restraint were significantly elevated in ratsnakes compared to copperheads. This study provides guidelines for interpretation of venous hematology, plasma biochemistry, and blood gas values for free-ranging copperheads and ratsnakes in central North Carolina and demonstrates the physiological response to venous blood gas analytes secondary to capture and restraint."
https://openalex.org/W3006124708,"Main objective To prospectively assess the cost-consequence of a standardized diagnostic strategy as to compared to an open one for the etiological diagnosis of uveitis. Design This was a prospective, non-inferiority, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Methods We included all consecutive patients with uveitis who had visited at least one of the Departments of Ophthalmology. In the standardized group, patients had a minimal work-up regardless of the type of uveitis (including evaluation of the CBC, ESR, C-reactive protein, tuberculin skin test, syphilis serology and chest X-ray). Depending on ophthalmological findings, further investigations could be performed. In the open strategy, ophthalmologists were free to order any kind of investigation. The main outcome was the mean cost per patient of each strategy. Results 903 uveitis patients were included from January, 2010 to May, 2013. The mean cost per patient of the standardized strategy was 182.97 euros [CI 95% (173.14; 192.80)], and the mean cost per patient of the open strategy was 251.75 euros [CI 95% (229.24; 274.25)]. Therefore, the mean cost per patient of the standardized strategy was significantly lower than the mean cost per patient of the open strategy (p<0.001). There were significantly fewer visits (p<0.001), fewer radiological procedures (p<0.004) and fewer laboratory investigations (p<0.001) in the standardized group. Conclusion A standardized strategy is a cost-saving approach for the etiological diagnosis of uveitis."

Despite the benefits of sports participation, a substantial proportion of adolescents fail to meet Canadian guidelines regarding physical activity. In this regard, it is relevant to understand the mechanisms underlying the adoption of various active behaviours. This study aims to identify the predisposing, enabling and reinforcing factors that potentially influence 4 categories of active behaviours using the Youth Physical Activity Promotion model (YPAP). Data was drawn from 416 male adolescent hockey players (Mage = 15.4; SD = 2) who completed a pre-validated questionnaire. Structural equation modeling and interaction analyses were performed to explain the contribution of each determinant. Findings reveal that there are different behavioural patterns based on the type of activity. The interaction between attitudes and environmental factors was a key predictor for each type of behaviour. Perceived competence was associated with more recreational activities, whereas the support of parents and coaches determined involvement in ice hockey. This study refined our understanding of physical activity participation among adolescents already involved in organized sports and emphasized the importance of considering multiple factors surrounding their environment. Several practical recommendations are made to improve young athletes' predisposition to practice physical activity in an organized sports setting."

Children aged from 3 to 7 years with refractive amblyopia (Landolt C equivalent < 0.8) were recruited. All participants were followed for at least 6 months after full correction of the refraction error by spectacles. The HOAs were measured using iDesign before and after cycloplegia at first visit and at 3-month intervals. Then correlation between BCVA recovery after treatment for 6 months and HOAs was determined.We analyzed 24 eyes of 12 children (mean age, 4.5 years). Baseline mean BCVA was logarithm of minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) 0.335 (Landolt C equivalent 0.46), which improved to logMAR 0.193 (Landolt C equivalent 0.64) after treatment with full-correction spectacles for 6 months. The amblyopic eye BCVA recovery was negatively correlated with tetrafoil with/without cycloplegia (P = 0.006 and 0.022, respectively) and trefoil with cycloplegia (P = 0.049).trefoil and tetrafoil measured with iDesign negatively correlates with the BCVA recovery speed of refractive amblyopic eyes after spectacles treatment in this pilot study. The current study results may aid in further investigation for diagnosis and treatment of refractory refractive and idiopathic amblyopia."
https://openalex.org/W3005536975,"I waited until my Ph.D. committee had left the room to break down. I sank into a chair, head in hands, as my committee meeting form sat unsigned on the lectern. I had just failed my dissertation proposal defense—a poor start to my fourth year of grad school. My committee members had told me that my experiments were too small-scale, my ideas not deep enough. I realize now that they were pushing me because they believed in me. They told me as much. But in that moment, I could not hear anything positive. All I could hear was the voice in my head telling me that I'd failed.



> “My new approach … has given me a resilience that I wish I had earlier in my Ph.D.” 

The setback sapped me of all motivation. For the next 4 months, I lacked focus at work. I no longer double-checked that I was fully prepared before starting a lab protocol, and I had trouble finding the energy to even think about re-writing my proposal.

I was surprised at my unraveling. I had passed my qualifying exam without issue; I had thought I was a successful graduate student. Surely, I was more resilient than to let one failure demoralize me. When I shared my struggle with colleagues, they assured me that a loss of motivation was normal at this stage in grad school, even without any major setbacks. One senior grad student called it “the dreaded fourth-year slump.” But normal or not, I wanted to understand why I felt that way.

My colleagues were right about one thing: The outcome of my proposal defense wasn't the only cause of my slump. After some thought, it dawned on me that I had been putting undue pressure on myself throughout grad school. To believe I was making good progress, I needed external validation—an award, positive results, or praise from professors I respected. When I didn't get those things at every opportunity, I felt I was not on the right track.

That mindset became a hindrance during my third year, because I didn't have much new to show for my efforts in the lab. I spent time repeating experiments as I started to mold my findings into a publishable format, and I attempted a few long-shot experiments that failed. I received fewer compliments on my work, and that made me feel as though I was progressing slowly compared with earlier in my Ph.D. program. To make matters worse, I compared myself to my peers, and when awards went to others, I wilted.

In the weeks leading up to my proposal defense, I suffered from anxiety because I feared that my committee would see the shortcomings that I perceived in myself. Lacking confidence in my work, I proposed experiments that were doable but not exactly paradigm-shifting. And when I didn't pass, the failure confirmed my self-doubts. Eventually, as my loss of confidence became a bigger problem, I knew that I had to do something about it.

I decided that I needed to set healthier standards for myself. I did not have control over how much praise I received or how many new data I generated. The only thing I had control over, I realized, was the effort I put forth. So, I started to regularly check in with myself and ask, “Am I doing my best?” If the answer was yes, then I could be proud. If the answer was no, then it was within my power to turn things around.

I went into my second proposal defense with a much more positive mindset—along with grander experiments in my proposal—and passed 5 months after my first attempt. I've also used the approach to change my focus during the day-to-day grind of benchwork. Now, instead of fixating on whether my experiments generate exciting data that others will compliment, I focus on thoroughly planning and meticulously executing my lab protocols. I also avoid comparing my research progress to that of my peers; their journey is theirs alone.

I'm pleased to report that my new approach has helped me regain confidence in myself—and my work—and I'm more productive as a result. It has given me a resilience that I wish I had earlier in my Ph.D. I hope that I can help other students realize that external validation is not always guaranteed, and if they are doing their best, that is good enough."
