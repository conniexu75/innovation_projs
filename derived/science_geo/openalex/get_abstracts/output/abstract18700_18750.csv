https://openalex.org/W2035562653,"Signaling through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) results both in rapid increases in tyrosine phosphorylation on a number of proteins and in the activation of the phosphatidylinositol pathway. It is not clear how stimulation of the TCR leads to these signaling events. Mutants of the Jurkat T cell line have been previously isolated that fail to show increases in calcium following receptor stimulation. Analysis of one of these mutants, JCaM1, which is defective in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation, revealed a defect in the expression of functional lck tyrosine kinase. The lack of lck activity was caused in part by a splicing defect. Expression of the lck cDNA in JCaM1 restores the ability of the cell to respond to TCR stimulation. These results indicate that lck is required for normal signal transduction through the TCR."
https://openalex.org/W2104831013,"Classical neurotransmitters are transported into synaptic vesicles so that their release can be regulated by neural activity. In addition, the vesicular transport of biogenic amines modulates susceptibility to N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the active metabolite of the neurotoxin N-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine that produces a model of Parkinson's disease. Taking advantage of selection in MPP+, we have used gene transfer followed by plasmid rescue to identify a cDNA clone that encodes a vesicular amine transporter. The sequence predicts a novel mammalian protein with 12 transmembrane domains and homology to a class of bacterial drug resistance transporters. We have detected messenger RNA transcripts for this transporter only in the adrenal gland. Monoamine cell populations in the brain stem express a distinct but highly related protein."
https://openalex.org/W2021170422,"A human cDNA was cloned that encodes a DNA-binding protein (SATB1) that is expressed predominantly in thymus and binds selectively to the nuclear matrix/scaffold-associating DNAs (MARs/SARs). Missing nucleoside experiments showed that SATB1 selectively binds in a special AT-rich sequence context where one strand consists of mixed A's, T's, and C's, excluding G's (ATC sequences). When this feature is destroyed by mutation, SATB1 binding is greatly reduced even if the direct contact sequence remains intact. Conjunctional SATB1-binding sequences become stably unpaired in supercoiled DNA. Specific mutations that diminish the unwinding potential greatly reduce SATB1 binding. However, SATB1 does not bind single-stranded DNA. Chemical interference assays show that SATB1 binds along the minor groove with very little contact with the bases. This suggests that SATB1 recognizes the ATC sequence indirectly through the altered sugar-phosphate backbone structure present in the double-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1982810916,"A point mutation in the POU-specific portion of the human gene that encodes the tissue-specific POU-domain transcription factor, Pit-1, results in hypopituitarism, with deficiencies of growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. In two unrelated Dutch families, a mutation in Pit-1 that altered an alanine in the first putative Î± helix of the POU-specific domain to proline was observed. This mutation generated a protein capable of binding to DNA response elements but unable to effectively activate its known target genes, growth hormone and prolactin. The phenotype of the affected individuals suggests that the mutant Pit-1 protein is competent to initiate other programs of gene activation required for normal proliferation of somatotrope, lactotrope, and thyrotrope cell types. Thus, a mutation in the POU-specific domain of Pit-1 has a selective effect on a subset of Pit-1 target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2032856364,Anergy is a mechanism of T lymphocyte tolerance induced by antigen receptor stimulation in the absence of co-stimulation. Anergic T cells were shown to have a defect in antigen-induced transcription of the interleukin-2 gene. Analysis of the promoter indicated that the transcription factor AP-1 and its corresponding cis element were specifically down-regulated. Exposure of anergic T cells to interleukin-2 restored both antigen responsiveness and activity of the AP-1 element.
https://openalex.org/W1984143972,"Cells with distinct developmental histories can respond differentially to identical signals, suggesting that signals are interpreted in a fashion that reflects a cell's identity. How this might occur is suggested by the observation that proteins of the homeodomain family, including a newly identified human protein, enhance the DNA-binding activity of serum response factor, a protein required for the induction of genes by growth and differentiation factors. Interaction with proteins of the serum response factor family may allow homeodomain proteins to specify the transcriptional response to inductive signals. Moreover, because the ability to enhance the binding of serum response factor to DNA resides within the homeodomain but is independent of homeodomain DNA-binding activity, this additional activity of the homeodomain may account for some of the specificity of action of homeodomain proteins in development."
https://openalex.org/W1578555077,"Nitric oxide and nitric oxide-generating agents like 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) stimulate the mono-ADP-ribosylation of a cytosolic, 39-kDa protein in various tissues. This protein was purified from human platelet cytosol by conventional and fast protein liquid chromatography techniques. N-terminal sequence analysis identified the isolated protein as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Nitric oxide stimulates the auto-ADP-ribosylation of GAPDH in a time and concentration-dependent manner with maximal effects after about 60 min. Associated with ADP-ribosylation is a loss of enzymatic activity. NAD(+)-free enzyme is not inhibited by SIN-1, indicating the absolute requirement of NAD+ as the substrate of the ADP-ribosylation reaction. Inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH may be relevant as a cytotoxic effect of NO complementary to its inhibitory actions on iron-sulfur enzymes like aconitase and electron transport proteins of the respiratory chain."
https://openalex.org/W2072293838,"Each abdominal hemisegment in the Drosophila embryo contains a stereotyped array of 30 muscles, each specifically innervated by one or a few motoneurons. We screened 11,000 enhancer trap lines, isolated several expressing beta-galactosidase in small subsets of muscle fibers prior to innervation, and identified two of these as inserts in connectin and Toll, members of the leucine-rich repeat gene family. Connectin contains a signal sequence, ten leucine-rich repeats, and a putative phosphatidylinositol membrane linkage; in S2 cells, connectin can mediate homophilic cell adhesion. Connectin is expressed on the surface of eight muscles, the motoneurons that innervate them, and several glial cells along the pathways leading to them. During synapse formation, the protein localizes to synaptic sites; afterward, it largely disappears. Thus, connectin is a novel cell adhesion molecule whose expression suggests a role in target recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2130594082,"This report describes the structure of the mRNA, the protein product, and the growth-regulating activity of one of the growth arrest-specific genes, gas1. From the predicted amino acid sequence, in vitro translation of gas1 mRNA, and immunofluorescence of cells in culture, it appears that the gas1 protein is an integral plasma membrane protein whose expression is linked to growth arrest. When gas1 is overexpressed from a constitutive promoter in quiescent cells, the serum-induced transition from the G0 to the S phase of the cell cycle is inhibited without affecting the normal early serum response. Ectopic expression of the gas1 gene by microinjection in normal and transformed NIH 3T3 cell lines with the notable exception of SV40-transformed 3T3 cells leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. Thus, gas1 appears to be one component of a negative circuit that governs growth suppression. Its effect is, however, abolished in SV40-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1541051315,"Activation of the NADPH oxidase of phagocytes in the cell-free system requires the association of several cytosolic components with membrane-bound cytochrome b. In this study we were able to fully reconstitute NADPH oxidase activity in the cell-free system with three recombinant proteins: p67-phox, p47-phox, p21rac1, and pure cytochrome b-245. Activity was dependent upon the concentration of the proteins, with maximal activity observed with roughly equimolar ratios of the cytochrome b and p67-phox (133 and 163 mol/s/mol, respectively) and concentrations of the other two proteins approximately 1 order of magnitude greater. No activity was observed in the absence of any one of these components. In addition, activation was dependent upon p21rac1 being preloaded with GTP, the cytochrome b being reconstituted with lipid, and the presence of FAD during activation. Half-maximal activity was observed at a concentration of NADPH of approximately 50 microM. These findings confirm our recent description of the membrane-bound cytochrome b as a FAD-containing flavocytochrome b containing the NADPH binding site, and implicate the three cytosolic proteins in its activation."
https://openalex.org/W2068089675,"Loss-of-function mutations in the yan gene result in the differentiation of supernumerary photoreceptors in the Drosophila eye. The yan gene encodes a protein with an ETS DNA-binding domain that accumulates in the nuclei of undifferentiated cells during the early stages of eye development. Our data suggest that yan functions as a cell-autonomous negative regulator of photoreceptor development; in the presumptive R7 and cone cells, yan appears to act antagonistically to the proneural signal mediated by sevenless and Ras1."
https://openalex.org/W1973439201,"Complementary DNA clones from the pink-eyed dilution (p) locus of mouse chromosome 7 were isolated from murine melanoma and melanocyte libraries. The transcript from this gene is missing or altered in six independent mutant alleles of the p locus, suggesting that disruption of this gene results in the hypopigmentation phenotype that defines mutant p alleles. Characterization of the human homolog revealed that it is localized to human chromosome 15 at q11.2-q12, a region associated with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, suggesting that altered expression of this gene may be responsible for the hypopigmentation phenotype exhibited by certain individuals with these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2030852504,"The strengths of electrostatic interactions in biological molecules are difficult to calculate or predict because they occur in complicated, inhomogeneous environments. The electric field at the amino terminus of an Î± helix in water has been determined by measuring the shift in the absorption band for a covalently attached, neutral probe molecule with an electric dipole moment difference between the ground and excited electronic states (an internal Stark effect). The field at the interface between the helix and the solvent is found to be an order of magnitude stronger than expected from the dielectric properties of bulk water. Furthermore, although the total electric dipole moment of the helix increases with length, the electric field at the amino terminus does not."
https://openalex.org/W2077884141,"Centromeres of mammalian and other complex eukaryotic chromosomes are dominated by one or more classes of satellite DNA. To test the hypothesis that alpha-satellite DNA, the major centromeric satellite of primate chromosomes, is involved in centromere structure and/or function, human alpha-satellite DNA was introduced into African green monkey (AGM) cells. Centromere protein binding was apparent at the sites of integrated human alpha-satellite DNA. In the presence of an AGM centromere on the same chromosome, human alpha-satellite was associated with bridges between the separating sets of chromatids at anaphase and an increased number of lagging chromosomes at metaphase, both features consistent with the integrated alpha-satellite disrupting normal chromosome segregation. These experiments suggest that alpha-satellite DNA provides the primary sequence information for centromere protein binding and for at least some functional aspect(s) of a mammalian centromere, playing a role either in kinetochore formation or in sister chromatid apposition."
https://openalex.org/W2012879673,"SH2 regions are protein motifs capable of binding target protein sequences that contain a phosphotyrosine. The solution structure of the abl SH2 product, a protein of 109 residues and 12.1 kd, has been determined by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It is a compact spherical domain with a pair of three-stranded antiparallel Î² sheets and a C-terminal Î± helix enclosing the hydrophobic core. Three arginines project from a short N-terminal Î± helix and one Î² sheet into the putative phosphotyrosine-binding site, which lies on a face distal from the termini. Comparison with other SH2 sequences supports a common global fold and mode of phosphotyrosine binding for this family."

https://openalex.org/W1998765173,"The FadR protein of E. coli activates transcription of the fabA gene, a key enzyme of fatty acid synthesis. We report that FadR binds to a DNA sequence positioned at â40 relative to the start site of the FadR-regulated fabA transcript (the location favored by positive activators). This binding was found to be specifically antagonized by long chain acyl-CoAs. The chain length specificity of the disassociation of the FadR-DNA complex by acyl-CoAs observed in vitro reflects that seen in the repression of fabA transcription observed upon addition of fatty acids to bacterial cultures. Acyl-CoA antagonism of FadR-DNA interactions is readily reversible. These data indicate that repression of fabA transcription by fatty acids is the first reported example of a repression system mediated by positive control."
https://openalex.org/W1639005451,"Agents that mobilize sequestered intracellular Ca2+, including ionophore A23187, EGTA, thapsigargin, and Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 (where Cbz is benzyloxycarbonyl), or mild reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol, disrupt early protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), inhibit translational initiation, and trigger the induction of GRP78, an ER resident protein. Inhibition of translational initiation in response to acute treatment (15-30 min) of intact GH3 pituitary cells with each of these agents was accompanied by an average 5-fold increase in the amount of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 alpha and a 50% reduction in eIF-2B activity. With continued exposure to A23187 (3 h) rates of amino acid incorporation partially recovered, eIF-2 alpha became dephosphorylated, and the inhibition of eIF-2B activity was abolished. These chronic effects were blocked by actinomycin D. Accumulating evidence that the ER may regulate rates of translational initiation through a signaling system altering the activity of eIF-2 is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1493698397,"In primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes the level of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase steady-state mRNA markedly decreased by 72 h. However, the addition of L-thyroxine (T4) and dexamethasone synergistically returned cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase steady-state mRNA levels near to that of cholestyramine-fed animals. The maximal responses to T4 and dexamethasone in serum-free medium were at 1.0 and 0.1 microM, respectively. The addition of T4 in combination with dexamethasone resulted in an 11-fold increase in transcriptional activity of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene as compared to no addition controls. The specific activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in microsomes prepared from cultures treated with dexamethasone and T4 were 1.56 +/- 1.17 nmol/h/mg protein which is similar to that of intact liver (1.70 +/- 0.062 nmol/h/mg protein), but lower than cholestyramine-fed animals. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was not detectable (less than 0.020 nmol/h/mg protein) at 72 h in cultures without the addition of both dexamethasone and T4. In the presence of optimal concentrations of dexamethasone and T4, glucagon (0.2 microM), or dibutyryl cAMP (50 microM) decreased (90%) cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA within 6 h. Transcriptional activity decreased (62%) in 6 h following the addition of glucagon (0.2 microM) to the culture medium. The results reported in this paper suggest an important role for multiple hormones in the regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2029099397,"Interactions between similar but not identical (homeologous) DNA sequences play an important biological role in the evolution of genes and genomes. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of genetic recombination, we have studied inter- and intramolecular homeologous recombination in S. cerevisiae during transformation. We found that homeologous DNAs recombine efficiently. Hybrid sequences were obtained between two mammalian cytochrome P450 cDNAs, sharing 73% identity, and between the yeast ARG4 gene and its human homeologous cDNA, sharing 52% identity. Sequencing data showed that the preferred recombination events are those corresponding to the overall alignment of the DNA sequences and that the junctions are within stretches of identity of variable length (2-21 nt). We suggest that these events occur by a conventional homologous recombination mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2078274249,"Computer simulations of the supercoiling of DNA, largely limited to stochastic search techniques, can offer important information to complement analytical models and experimental data. Through association of an energy function, minimum-energy supercoiled conformations, fluctuations about these states, and interconversions among forms may be sought. In theory, the observation of such large-scale conformational changes is possible, but modeling and numerical considerations limit the picture obtained in practice. A new computational approach is reported that combines an idealized elastic energy model, a compact B-spline representation of circular duplex DNA, and deterministic minimization and molecular dynamics algorithms. A trefoil knotting result, made possible by a large time-step dynamics scheme, is described. The simulated strand passage supports and details a supercoiled-directed knotting mechanism. This process may be associated with collective bending and twisting motions involved in supercoiling propagation and interwound branching. The results also demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the Langevin/implicit-Euler dynamics scheme for studying biomolecular folding and reactions over biologically interesting time scales."
https://openalex.org/W1479942921,"Intact cells and cell-free systems were employed to characterize phospholipase D (PLD) activity in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In cells prelabeled with [3H]glycerol, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) elicited phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis by PLD, as shown by the prolonged formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol (PEt) and an accompanying decrease in [3H]PC. In contrast, bradykinin elicited rapid formation of [3H]PEt (approximately 1 min) accompanied by a decrease in [3H]phosphatidylinositol (PI). When the agonists were administered simultaneously, [3H]PEt formation was biphasic. In cells prelabeled with [3H] choline, at times less than 1 min, bradykinin failed to induce significant change in [3H]choline release. Bradykinin-induced formation of [3H]PEt in the [3H]glycerol-labeled cells was strictly dependent on extracellular Ca2+, whereas TPA-induced formation of [3H]PEt did not require extracellular Ca2+. Cell-free assays for PLD were used to assess the enzyme location, substrate specificity, and cofactor requirements. The PC-PLD activity (PEt formation) against [3H]stearoyl-PC was primarily localized in the 440 x g pellet (membrane- and nuclear-associated), preferred PC as a substrate, required detergent, and was not influenced by Ca2+ at low concentrations but was inhibited by Ca2+ in excess of 0.5 mM. The PI-PLD activity against [3H]stearoyl-PI was found largely in the 100,000 x g supernatant (cytosol), was strictly Ca(2+)-dependent, and did not require detergent. From these data, we conclude that MDCK cells contain two PLD subtypes: 1) a membrane-associated, PC-selective enzyme that responds to TPA resulting in prolonged hydrolysis of PC (the PC-PLD is Ca(2+)-independent, but requires detergent); 2) a cytosolic, PI-selective enzyme that responds rapidly but transiently to bradykinin (the PI-PLD requires Ca2+ but not detergent)."
https://openalex.org/W1530704664,"DnaA protein (the initiator protein) binds and clusters at the four DnaA boxes of the Escherichia coli chromosomal origin (oriC) to promote the strand opening for DNA replication. DnaA protein activity depends on the tight binding of ATP; the ADP form of DnaA protein, generated by hydrolysis of the bound ATP, is inactive. Rejuvenation of ADP-DnaA protein, by replacement with ATP, is catalyzed by acidic phospholipids in a highly fluid bilayer. We find that interaction of DnaA protein with oriC DNA is needed to stabilize DnaA protein during this rejuvenation process. Whereas DnaA protein bound to oriC DNA responds to phospholipids, free DnaA protein is inactivated by phospholipids and then fails to bind oriC. Furthermore, oriC DNA facilitates the high affinity binding of ATP to DnaA protein during treatment with phospholipids. A significant portion of the DnaA protein associated with oriC DNA can be replaced by the ADP form of the protein, suggesting that all of the DnaA protein bound to oriC DNA need not be rejuvenated between rounds of replication."
https://openalex.org/W2077603372,"A pseudo--half-knot can be formed by binding an oligonucleotide asymmetrically to an RNA hairpin loop. This binding motif was used to target the human immunodeficiency virus TAR element, an important viral RNA structure that is the receptor for Tat, the major viral transactivator protein. Oligonucleotides complementary to different halves of the TAR structure bound with greater affinity than molecules designed to bind symmetrically around the hairpin. The pseudo--half-knot--forming oligonucleotides altered the TAR structure so that specific recognition and binding of a Tat-derived peptide was disrupted. This general binding motif may be used to disrupt the structure of regulatory RNA hairpins."
https://openalex.org/W2055323371,"We cloned the GCD5 gene of S. cerevisiae and found it to be identical to KRS1, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS). The mutation gcd5-1 changes a conserved residue in the putative lysine-binding domain of LysRS. This leads to a defect in lysine binding and, consequently, to reduced charging of tRNALys. Mutant gcd5-1 cells compensate for the defect in LysRS by increasing GCN4 expression at the translational level. GCN4 protein in turn stimulates transcription of GCD5, leading to increased LysRS activity. We propose an autoregulatory model in which uncharged tRNALys stimulates the protein kinase GCN2, a translational activator of GCN4, and thereby increases transcription of GCD5 and other genes regulated by GCN4."
https://openalex.org/W2087324955,"Joint refinement of macromolecules against crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) observations is presented as a way of combining experimental information from the two methods. The model of interleukin-1 beta derived by the joint x-ray and NMR refinement is shown to be consistent with the experimental observations of both methods and to have crystallographic R value and geometrical parameters that are of the same quality as or better than those of models obtained by conventional crystallographic studies. The few NMR observations that are violated by the model serve as an indicator for genuine differences between the crystal and solution structures. The joint x-ray-NMR refinement can resolve structural ambiguities encountered in studies of multidomain proteins, in which low- to medium-resolution diffraction data can be complemented by higher resolution NMR data obtained for the individual domains."

https://openalex.org/W1584829433,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediates a variety of cellular responses in most eukaryotic cells. Many of these responses are cytoplasmic, whereas others appear to require nuclear localization of the catalytic subunit. In order to understand further the molecular basis for subcellular localization of the catalytic subunit, the effect of the heat stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) was investigated. The subcellular localization of the catalytic (C) subunit was determined both in the presence and absence of PKI, by microinjecting fluorescently labeled C subunit into single living cells. When injected alone, a significant fraction of the dissociated C subunit localized to the nucleus. When coin-injected with an excess of PKI, little of the C subunit localized to the nucleus, suggesting that accumulation of catalytic subunit in the nucleus requires either enzymatic activity or a nuclear localization signal. Inactivation of the catalytic subunit in vitro by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide did not prevent localization in the nucleus, indicating that enzymatic activity was not a prerequisite for nuclear localization. In an effort to search for a specific signal that might mediate nuclear localization, a complex of the catalytic subunit with a 20-residue inhibitory peptide derived from PKI (PKI(5-24)) was microinjected. In contrast to intact PKI, the peptide was not sufficient to block nuclear accumulation. In the presence of PKI(5-24), the C subunit localized to the nucleus in a fashion analogous to that of dissociated, active C subunit despite evidence of no catalytic activity in situ. Thus, nuclear localization of the C subunit appears to be independent of enzymatic activity but most likely dependent upon a signal. The signal is apparently masked by both the regulatory subunit and PKI but not by the inhibitory peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2074281406,"In the past year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has filed patent applications on more than 2750 partial complementary DNA sequences of unknown function. The rationale for the filings--that patent protection may be necessary to ensure that private firms are willing to invest in developing related products--rests on two premises: first, that NIH may obtain patent rights that will offer effective product monopolies to licensee firms, and second, that unless NIH obtains these rights now, firms will be unable to obtain a comparable degree of exclusivity by other means, such as by obtaining patents on their own subsequent innovations. Neither premise is clearly wrong, although both are subject to doubt in view of statements from industry representatives that the NIH patenting strategy will deter rather than promote product development."
https://openalex.org/W299258999,"Tumor-promoting phorbol esters or calcium-mobilizing receptor ligands stimulate phosphatidylcholine breakdown and in many cells this is accompanied by phospholipase D (PLD) activation. We tested whether or not a direct relationship exists between these two phenomena. Pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were stimulated with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate or with the calcium-mobilizing receptor ligand bradykinin in media containing 1% ethanol. The fatty acid composition of the molecular species of phosphatidylethanol (PEt), a product of PLD activation, formed in stimulated cells was compared with the molecular species of endogenous phospholipids isolated from unstimulated PC12 cells. PEt was isolated and analyzed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) in the negative ion mode. Fatty acid composition and headgroup structure of the major PEt molecular ions were confirmed by linked scan analysis. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol were isolated from unstimulated cells and converted into phosphatidic acids using PLD. Mass spectra of the respective phosphatidic acids were obtained by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry as described above. The molecular species of PEt formed in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate- and bradykinin-stimulated PC12 cell were identical to those of phosphatidylcholine isolated from untreated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487035530,"To study intramitochondrial phospholipid flow, radiolabeled phosphatidylserine was introduced into isolated rat liver mitochondria from donor vesicles through the action of a nonspecific lipid transfer protein. Imported phosphatidylserine was rapidly decarboxylated to phosphatidylethanolamine. Both the imported phosphatidylserine and the formed phosphatidylethanolamine were confined to the outer membrane. The enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase was shown to be located exclusively in the inner membrane. It was not enriched in isolated contact site fractions. 1,4-Dinitrophenol caused an inhibition of the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. This inhibition was not due to the uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation itself, but possibly due to a decrease in the number of contact sites. This suggests that phosphatidylserine flows from the outer membrane to the inner membrane through contact sites between inner and outer membrane to become decarboxylated and that the formed phosphatidylethanolamine flows directly back to the outer membrane, without mixing with inner membrane phosphatidylethanolamine."

https://openalex.org/W1599614856,"Two different types of macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF) were found, one with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa and the other greater than 200 kDa. The high molecular mass M-CSF was identified as a proteoglycan carrying chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan and was designated as the proteoglycan form of M-CSF (PG-M-CSF). In this study, we compared the biological activity of the 85-kDa M-CSF and PG-M-CSF and examined the binding properties of these two M-CSF to certain extracellular matrix proteins, i.e. types I-V collagen and fibronectin, using a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PG-M-CSF was capable of supporting the formation of murine macrophage colonies, and pretreatment of PG-M-CSF with chondroitinase AC, which degrades chondroitin sulfate, did not alter its colony-stimulating activity. The specific activity of PG-M-CSF was similar to that of the 85-kDa M-CSF. The 85-kDa M-CSF had no apparent affinity for the extracellular matrix proteins examined, whereas PG-M-CSF had an appreciable binding capacity to type V collagen, but did not bind to types I, II, III, and IV collagen or to fibronectin. Pretreatment of PG-M-CSF with chondroitinase AC completely abolished the binding of the species to type V collagen. Addition of exogenous chondroitin sulfate inhibited the binding of PG-M-CSF to type V collagen in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicated that the interaction between PG-M-CSF and type V collagen was mediated by the chondroitin sulfate chain of PG-M-CSF. PG-M-CSF bound to type V collagen could stimulate the proliferation of bone marrow macrophages, indicating that the matrix protein-bound PG-M-CSF retained its biological activity. This interaction between PG-M-CSF and type V collagen implies that the role of PG-M-CSF may be distinct from that of 85-kDa M-CSF."

https://openalex.org/W1969527404,This article provides a historical perspective for the patenting of gene sequences and describes the fundamentals and evolution of patent law. It summarizes federal technology transfer law and policy and assesses the impacts of patenting on academic research. The patentability of gene sequences is then considered along with potential impacts that published sequence data may have on obtaining patent protection for downstream products. Industry's position on gene patenting is summarized and perspectives from the emerging public record on these issues are presented. The article discussing points at which the filing of patent applications and the licensing of patents may be appropriate. It concludes that technology transfer policies for genome research must be adopted carefully so that they remain viable in a time of rapid technological change.

https://openalex.org/W1493980809,"The cytotoxic activities of restrictocin with aminoterminal extensions and specific mutations were investigated using in vivo and in vitro systems. Genes were constructed from the cDNA clone of restrictocin which encode: the native form of restrictocin (including the leader sequence); Met-prorestrictocin, in which a codon for methionine was placed before a putative pro region; Met-mature restrictocin, with a methionine codon prior to the mature form of restrictocin; and three mutated forms of Met-mature restrictocin, E95G, E115G/H136L, and H136L. These constructions were placed under the control of the GAL1 promoter and were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transformants were killed, and a new RNA band formed when any of these genes except those containing the H136L mutation were expressed. Restrictocin protein was detected by immunoblot only in cells expressing the native form of restrictocin and the forms containing the H136L mutation. Native restrictocin, Met-prorestrictocin, and Met-mature restrictocin mRNA were translated in an in vitro system resulting in proteins of the expected molecular weight and inactivation of the translation system. Restrictocin was not inactivated by the presence of the leader sequence and the putative prosequence. Amino acid His136 is putatively in the active site of restrictocin by analogy to ribonuclease U2 and the elimination of toxic effects in the S. cerevisiae expression and in vitro translation systems."

We have used a filter binding assay to analyze the interaction between purified trp repressor and a synthetic 43-base pair DNA fragment containing the natural trp promoter-operator region. In equilibrium binding experiments, the KD of high affinity binding of trp repressor to this DNA fragment was determined to be 2 x 10(-10) M. Low affinity binding was observed at repressor concentrations above 10 nM. In kinetic experiments with various input ratios of repressor to operator, trp repressor-operator complexes dissociated with equivalent, first-order kinetics. Instantaneous reduction of the tryptophan concentration resulted in increased rates of complex dissociation, indicating that loss of one or both tryptophan molecules from the repressor-operator complex destabilizes the complex. A heterodimeric repressor with a single tryptophan binding site was constructed and its affinity for operator was compared with that of ligand free aporepressor and tryptophan saturated repressor. The heterodimeric repressor had a 20-25-fold higher affinity for operator than did the aporepressor, and it had a 20-25-fold lower affinity for operator than did the tryptophan-saturated repressor."

In the infected H9 cells, a 37% increase of dCTP pool and a 34% increase of dATP were observed, and no alteration of dTTP and dGTP was observed, compared with the uninfected H9 cells. A marked decrease of ARA-CTP generation was observed in the infected H9 cells after 3-h incubation with 0.1-10 microM ARA-C. The level of deoxycytidine kinase activity with ARA-C as substrate was similar in both the infected and the uninfected cells; however, a 37-fold increase of cytidine deaminase activity was observed in the infected H9 cells. These results indicate that the induction of cytidine deaminase activity by HIV-1(IIIB) infection conferred ARA-C resistance to H9 cells. This conclusion was supported by the observation that a marked reversal of ARA-C resistance in the infected H9 cells occurred after treatment with the inhibitor of cytidine deaminase, 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine. The understanding of these cellular alterations in drug sensitivity may facilitate the development of effective therapeutic strategies against HIV-1-infected cells."
