https://openalex.org/W2150380575,"The WNK1 and WNK4 genes have been found to be mutated in some patients with hyperkalemia and hypertension caused by pseudohypoaldosteronism type II. The clue to the pathophysiology of pseudohypoaldosteronism type II was its striking therapeutic response to thiazide diuretics, which are known to block the sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC). Although this suggests a role for WNK1 in hypertension, the precise molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we have shown that WNK1 phosphorylates and regulates the STE20-related kinases, Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress response 1 (OSR1). WNK1 was observed to phosphorylate the evolutionary conserved serine residue located outside the kinase domains of SPAK and OSR1, and mutation of the OSR1 serine residue caused enhanced OSR1 kinase activity. In addition, hypotonic stress was shown to activate SPAK and OSR1 and induce phosphorylation of the conserved OSR1 serine residue, suggesting that WNK1 may be an activator of the SPAK and OSR1 kinases. Moreover, SPAK and OSR1 were found to directly phosphorylate the N-terminal regulatory regions of cation-chloride-coupled cotransporters including NKCC1, NKCC2, and NCC. Phosphorylation of NCC was induced by hypotonic stress in cells. These results suggested that WNK1 and SPAK/OSR1 mediate the hypotonic stress signaling pathway to the transporters and may provide insights into the mechanisms by which WNK1 regulates ion balance."
https://openalex.org/W2012671266,"Defining the protein factors that directly recognize post-translational, covalent histone modifications is essential toward understanding the impact of these chromatin “marks” on gene regulation. In the current study, we identify human CHD1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, as a factor that directly and selectively recognizes histone H3 methylated on lysine 4. In vitro binding studies identified that CHD1 recognizes di- and trimethyl H3K4 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼5 μm, whereas monomethyl H3K4 binds CHD1 with a 3-fold lower affinity. Surprisingly, human CHD1 binds to methylated H3K4 in a manner that requires both of its tandem chromodomains. In vitro analyses demonstrate that unlike human CHD1, yeast Chd1 does not bind methylated H3K4. Our findings indicate that yeast and human CHD1 have diverged in their ability to discriminate covalently modified histones and link histone modification-recognition and non-covalent chromatin remodeling activities within a single human protein.

In the nucleus of cells, chromatin represents the physiological state of DNA, where it is associated with histone and non-histone proteins. Nucleosomes are the repeating unit of chromatin and are comprised of two copies each of the four histone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, wrapped by 147 base pairs of DNA. Histones are subject to a variety of post-translational, covalent modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (1Vaquero A. Loyola A. Reinberg D. Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2003; 2003: RE4Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In particular, global changes in histone methylation and acetylation are directly associated with cancer and, more importantly, may serve as a predictive indicator of clinical outcome (2Seligson D.B. Horvath S. Shi T. Yu H. Tze S. Grunstein M. Kurdistani S.K. Nature. 2005; 435: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of enzymes that catalyze histone lysine methylation are altered in various types of cancer and include enzymes that catalyze methylation on histone H3 lysine 4, such as MLL and SMYD3 (3Ayton P.M. Cleary M.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5695-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 4Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, lysine 4 trimethylation on histone H3 (H3K4me3) is tightly associated to the 5′ end of active genes (5Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 6Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S. Bailey D.K. Huebert D.J. McMahon S. Karlsson E.K. Kulbokas III, E.J. Gingeras T.R. Schreiber S.L. Lander E.S. Cell. 2005; 120: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). However, the functional and mechanistic significance of H3K4me3 is poorly understood. Generally, silent genes correspond with methylation at H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20, whereas active genes correspond with methylation at H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 (7Sims III, R.J. Nishioka K. Reinberg D. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 8Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The chromodomain is a protein motif that specifically recognizes methylated lysine residues within histones. The chromodomain-containing proteins HP1 and Pc recognize methylated lysines that correspond with silent genes, specifically H3K9 and H3K27, respectively. It was recently reported that the yeast chromodomain protein Chd1 binds directly to dimethyl H3K4 (H3K4me2) (9Pray-Grant M.G. Daniel J.A. Schieltz D. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Yeast and human CHD1 encode two chromodomains in tandem, although binding of yeast Chd1 to H3K4me2 was observed to occur only through its second chromodomain (9Pray-Grant M.G. Daniel J.A. Schieltz D. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, previous studies in yeast showed that the Chd1 double chromodomain does not bind to methylated H3K4 (10Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bernstein B.E. Karabetsou N. Morillon A. Weise C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). CHD1 is an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor that also functions as a chromatin assembly factor in vitro (11Tran H.G. Steger D.J. Iyer V.R. Johnson A.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Lusser A. Urwin D.L. Kadonaga J.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). CHD1 associates with active loci and is suspected to function during elongation, as deletion of CHD1 causes hyper-resistance to a 6-azauracil phenotype (13Woodage T. Basrai M.A. Baxevanis A.D. Hieter P. Collins F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11472-11477Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CHD1 displays physical and genetic interactions with numerous elongation factors (14Kelley D.E. Stokes D.G. Perry R.P. Chromosoma. 1999; 108: 10-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Krogan N.J. Kim M. Ahn S.H. Zhong G. Kobor M.S. Cagney G. Emili A. Shilatifard A. Buratowski S. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell.

Here, we report the specific and direct binding of human CHD1 to methylated H3K4. Human CHD1 was found to require both of its tandem chromodomains to interact with H3K4me3. Comparative analyses between yeast and human CHD1 using the crystal structures of chromodomain-methyl lysine interactions (18Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 19Nielsen P.R. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Callaghan J. Bannister A. Kouzarides T. Murzin A.G. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) predict that yeast Chd1 will not recognize methyl H3K4. Indeed, in vitro binding analyses demonstrate that yeast Chd1 fails to bind methylated H3K4. Thus, only the human CHD1 protein links covalent histone modifications with chromatin remodeling. Our results also suggest that yeast and higher organisms have diverged in their recognition and readout of modified histone tails. In Vitro Peptide Binding—Peptide-coupled resins were generated using SulfoLink coupling gel (Pierce). Histone peptides were synthesized by Global Peptide Services. CHD1 derived from HeLa nuclear extract was incubated with H3K4me0 or H3K4me3 peptide columns for 2 h at 4 °C, washed extensively (60 column volumes of 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and eluted with low pH buffer (100 mm glycine, pH 3.0). Various peptide-conjugated beads were incubated with yeast extracts expressing PtA-tagged Chd1 or Gcn5 and analyzed as described previously (10Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bernstein B.E. Karabetsou N. Morillon A. Weise C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). 10 μgof recombinant protein was incubated with various peptide columns for 2 h at 4 °C, washed extensively, and eluted with low pH buffer. Protein Expression, Western Blotting, and Silver Staining—The region encompassing the tandem chromodomains of human CHD1 was amplified by PCR using a HeLa cDNA library (BD Biosciences) and cloned into pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Biosciences). Point mutants of CHD1 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The tandem chromodomains of yeast Chd1 in pET11a was kindly provided by S. Khorasanizadeh. Proteins were expressed in bacteria (BL21, Novagen) and purified using standard procedures. The SANT domain of human SNF2h, and the human CHD1 fragments CD1 and CD2, were kindly provided by Rui-Ming Xu (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Western blotting was performed using standard techniques with antibodies against GST 2The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferase6AU6-azauracil. (Amersham Biosciences), PAP (Dako), and CHD1 (kind gift of Dr. R. P. Perry) (20Stokes D.G. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2745-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Silver staining was performed using standard molecular biology methods. glutathione S-transferase 6-azauracil. Fluorimetric Titration Assays—Fluorimetric peptide titration experiments were performed using a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorimeter (Spex Instruments) as described (21Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), using 25 mm NaCl and 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0. A constant amount of protein was used during peptide titrations (100 nm). Excitation was performed at 295 nm, and the emission was detected at 340 nm. Fluorescence values were corrected for sample dilution and resulting data were fit to Equation 1,Fc=fE×[P]Kd+[P]+fb(Eq. 1) where Fc is observed fluorescence, fE is the fluorescence change, fb is the background fluorescence, [P] is peptide concentration, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the peptide-protein complex. Functional Analysis of Yeast Chd1—BY4741 wild type and isogenic chd1::Kan mutant and CHD1-PtA yeast strains were grown in YPD (1% yeast, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) to OD = 0.6, subjected to serial dilutions, and “spotted” onto complete minimal medium (SDC) containing either 0, 750, or 1000 μg/ml 6AU. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C before imaged. Protein Alignment—Structural comparisons between various chromodomain-containing proteins were performed using the ClustalW (align.genome.jp/) and Boxshade (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html) programs. In an effort to determine the functional consequences of H3K4me3 in active transcription, we sought to identify factors in HeLa nuclear extracts that selectively bind this post-translational histone modification. Toward this end, we generated an affinity column using a peptide encompassing the first eight residues of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 4. A number of proteins implicated in transcription post-initiation processes were identified to bind H3K4me3 by a mixture of mass spectrometry and Western blot analyses (data not shown). As reported previously, SNF2h derived from nuclear extracts was observed to selectively recognize H3K4me3 but not the unmodified peptide (data not shown) (10Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bernstein B.E. Karabetsou N. Morillon A. Weise C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition to SNF2h, we identified the chromatin-remodeling protein CHD1 as an H3K4me3 binding factor. The association of CHD1 with H3K4me3 was specific, as no association with the unmodified peptide was observed (Fig. 1A). A highly purified fraction of CHD1 also retained the ability to bind H3K4me3 (data not shown). CHD1 encodes a number of conserved domains, including two tandem chromodomains (Fig. 1B). As the chromodomain has been demonstrated to selectively recognize methylated lysine residues, we hypothesized that CHD1 binds directly to H3K4me3 via its chromodomains. To test for direct binding, we subcloned the two chromodomains of human CHD1 into a GST expression vector (Fig. 1B). In vitro binding studies identified that human CHD1 binds directly and selectively to H3K4me3 (Fig. 1C). This binding was specific, as GST did not bind to H3K4me3 (Fig. 1C), and CHD1 failed to recognize H3K9me2 and H4K20me1 (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the SANT domain of SNF2h, a putative histone tail-presenting motif (22Boyer L.A. Latek R.R. Peterson C.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), also failed to recognize H3K4me3 (Fig. 1D). To more quantitatively assess the binding of H3K4me3 to CHD1, we performed fluorimetric binding equilibrium titrations using the intrinsic fluorescence of CHD1. A constant amount of CHD1 protein was titrated with an increasing concentration of H3 peptides. Upon titration of the H3K4me3 peptide, we observed an increase in fluorescence of CHD1 (Fig. 2A). Titration of the H3K4me0 peptide or buffer alone yielded no change in CHD1 fluorescence, suggesting no interaction between CHD1 and the unmodified H3 tail (Fig. 2A). Titration of an unrelated trimethylated H1K26me3 peptide (residues 20–37 of human H1b) had no effect on CHD1 fluorescence (data not shown). The calculated dissociation constants for CHD1 binding to H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 peptides were ∼5 μm, while the H3K4me1 peptide was 3-fold less (∼15 μm) (Fig. 2, B and C). During the course of our studies, it was reported that yeast Chd1 binds directly to H3K4me2 (9Pray-Grant M.G. Daniel J.A. Schieltz D. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), although previous in vitro binding studies with yeast Chd1 contradict these results (10Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bernstein B.E. Karabetsou N. Morillon A. Weise C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a fragment of yeast Chd1 only containing the second chromodomain was observed to bind methyl H3K4 based on peptide pull-down experiments (9Pray-Grant M.G. Daniel J.A. Schieltz D. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the authors suggested that the second chromodomain of Chd1 defines a new subclass of methyl binding motifs (KWxxLxY) (9Pray-Grant M.G. Daniel J.A. Schieltz D. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This motif is precisely conserved within the second chromodomain in human CHD1 (Fig. 3); thus, we tested the H3K4me3 binding ability of the individually expressed chromodomains of human CHD1. In contrast to the previously reported findings, we did not observe H3K4me3 association with either of the separately expressed chromodomains from CHD1 (Fig. 4A). Next, we generated point mutations at conserved aromatic residues within the first (CD1) and second (CD2) chromodomains of human CHD1. These residues are important for HP1 recognition of the methyl-lysine within H3K9me2 (18Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 19Nielsen P.R. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Callaghan J. Bannister A. Kouzarides T. Murzin A.G. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) (Figs. 3 and 4B). Surprisingly, when a single aromatic residue in either CD1 or CD2 was mutated, CHD1 failed to bind to H3K4me3 (Fig. 4B). Mutant CHD1 binding to H3K4me3 was also analyzed by fluorimetric titrations. Although the wild type protein bound H3K4me3 as described previously, neither the mutant-CD1 nor mutant-CD2 proteins interacted with the H3K4me3 peptide (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these results are in stark contrast to those reported for yeast Chd1 and suggest that human CHD1 requires both chromodomains to interact with methylated H3K4.FIGURE 4Human but not yeast CHD1 binds to methylated H3K4 via its tandem chromodomains.

Khorasanizadeh, personal communication. Importantly, comparison of the chromodomain structure of HP1 (18Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 19Nielsen P.R. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Callaghan J. Bannister A. Kouzarides T. Murzin A.G. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) with yeast and human CHD1 indicates that the first chromodomain (CD1) of yeast Chd1 lacks an important aromatic residue essential for methyl-lysine binding by HP1 and human CHD1 (Fig. 3). In the description of yeast Chd1-H3K4me2 binding, a His to Tyr mutation within the first chromodomain restored a putative KWxxLxY motif that facilitated binding of the yeast CD1 to H3K4me2 (9Pray-Grant M.G. Daniel J.A. Schieltz D. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, purple residues). The crystal structure of human CHD1 bound to methyl-H3K4 does not support these findings and clearly demonstrates the requirement of a KWxxW motif. These collective findings predict that yeast Chd1 lacks the structural determinants to bind methyl-H3K4. To directly test this prediction, the methyl-H3K4 binding ability of yeast Chd1 was analyzed. Yeast extracts expressing full-length tagged Chd1 or Gcn5 were incubated with peptide-coupled beads. While Gcn5 was observed to bind to each H3 tail regardless of its modification state, Chd1 failed to bind any of the H3-tail peptides, including methylated H3K4 (Fig. 4D). To test whether the tagged Chd1 used in Fig. 4D is functional in vivo, we utilized a CHD1 deletion strain that displays resistance to 6-azauracil, a phenotype indicative of deficiencies in transcript elongation (13Woodage T. Basrai M.A. Baxevanis A.D. Hieter P. Collins F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11472-11477Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Indeed, Chd1-PtA complemented this mutation in a manner identical to the wild type protein (Fig. 4E). Moreover, a fragment of yeast Chd1 encompassing its tandem chromodomains was analyzed for direct binding to methylated H3K4. Human CHD1 strongly recognized H3K4me2 peptides, while in contrast, yeast Chd1 failed to bind this methyl peptide under identical conditions (Fig. 4F). Fluorimetric titration experiments failed to detect any interaction between yeast Chd1 and mono-, di-, or trimethyl H3K4 peptides, although human CHD1 recognized these methyl peptides under identical conditions (Figs. 2 and 4G). Our results clearly indicate that contrary to human CHD1, yeast Chd1 does not bind methyl-H3K4. Our results are also supported by genetic studies, which demonstrate that yeast Chd1 localization on active genes is unaffected by deletion of Set1, the enzyme that catalyzes H3K4 methylation. 4J. Mellor, personal communication. Based on the requirement of the KWxxW motif, it is unlikely that CHD3 or CHD4 bind to methylated lysine residues (Fig. 3). Consistent with this notion, previous studies identified a preference of the NuRD complex, which contains CHD3 and CHD4, for the unmodified H3 tail (23Nishioka K. Chuikov S. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 24Zegerman P. Canas B. Pappin D. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11621-11624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Why does human CHD1 bind to methyl-H3K4 but yeast Chd1 does not? Illuminating the functional role of the human CHD1/methyl-H3K4 interaction will likely provide some answers, although the differences in the size and architecture of human genes compared with yeast may be a clue. Human genes are far larger and more complex than those found in yeast, and the binding of human CHD1 to methyl H3K4 might provide additional stability in its association, and the association of its interaction partners, with active genes.

Here we show that liquid flow through a membrane composed of an array of aligned carbon nanotubes is four to five orders of magnitude faster than would be predicted from conventional fluid-flow theory. This high fluid velocity results from an almost frictionless interface at the carbon-nanotube wall.

In this regard, AMPK-PGC-1alpha signaling mediates several adaptations to endurance training, while up-regulation of the Akt-TSC2-mTOR pathway may underlie increased protein synthesis after resistance exercise. We determined the effect of prior training history on signaling responses in seven strength-trained and six endurance-trained males who undertook 1 h cycling at 70% VO2peak or eight sets of five maximal repetitions of isokinetic leg extensions. Muscle biopsies were taken at rest, immediately and 3 h postexercise. AMPK phosphorylation increased after cycling in strength-trained (54%; P<0.05) but not endurance-trained subjects. Conversely, AMPK was elevated after resistance exercise in endurance- (114%; P<0.05), but not strength-trained subjects. Akt phosphorylation increased in endurance- (50%; P<0.05), but not strength-trained subjects after cycling but was unchanged in either group after resistance exercise. TSC2 phosphorylation was decreased (47%; P<0.05) in endurance-trained subjects following resistance exercise, but cycling had little effect on the phosphorylation state of this protein in either group. p70S6K phosphorylation increased in endurance- (118%; P<0.05), but not strength-trained subjects after resistance exercise, but was similar to rest in both groups after cycling. Similarly, phosphorylation of S6 protein, a substrate for p70 S6K, was increased immediately following resistance exercise in endurance- (129%; P<0.05), but not strength-trained subjects. In conclusion, a degree of ""response plasticity"" is conserved at opposite ends of the endurance-hypertrophic adaptation continuum. Moreover, prior training attenuates the exercise specific signaling responses involved in single mode adaptations to training."
https://openalex.org/W1974590591,"Covalent histone modifications and the incorporation of histone variants bring about changes in chromatin structure that in turn alter gene expression. Interest in non-allelic histone variants has been renewed, in part because of recent work on H3 (and other) histone variants. However, only in mammals do three non-centromeric H3 variants (H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3) exist. Here, we show that mammalian cell lines can be separated into two different groups based on their expression of H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 at both mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, the ratio of these variants changes slightly during neuronal differentiation of murine ES cells. This difference in H3 variant expression between cell lines could not be explained by changes in growth rate, cell cycle stages, or chromosomal ploidy, but rather suggests other possibilities, such as changes in H3 variant incorporation during differentiation and tissue- or species-specific H3 variant expression. Moreover, quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of human H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 showed modification differences between these three H3 variants, suggesting that they may have different biological functions. Specifically, H3.3 contains marks associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas H3.2, in contrast, contains mostly silencing modifications that have been associated with facultative heterochromatin. Interestingly, H3.1 is enriched in both active and repressive marks, although the latter marks are different from those observed in H3.2. Although the biological significance as to why mammalian cells differentially employ three highly similar H3 variants remains unclear, our results underscore potential functional differences between them and reinforce the general view that H3.1 and H3.2 in mammalian cells should not be treated as equivalent proteins. Covalent histone modifications and the incorporation of histone variants bring about changes in chromatin structure that in turn alter gene expression. Interest in non-allelic histone variants has been renewed, in part because of recent work on H3 (and other) histone variants. However, only in mammals do three non-centromeric H3 variants (H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3) exist. Here, we show that mammalian cell lines can be separated into two different groups based on their expression of H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 at both mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, the ratio of these variants changes slightly during neuronal differentiation of murine ES cells.

Eukaryotic organisms depend on complex and highly regulated mechanisms to activate or silence genes in response to a variety of stimuli, including environmental changes, cell cycle regulators, and developmental cues. An increasing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms involving chromatin remodeling alter the accessibility of proteins, such as transcription factors, to the DNA template. The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core particle, which consists of DNA in close association with an octameric unit of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). However, in some instances, specialized histone variants are found in place of the canonical histones, enabling the encoding of epigenetic information through defined or “specialized” nucleosome arrays (reviewed in Ref. 1Hake S.B. Xiao A. Allis C.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Histones are subject to a diverse array of covalent modifications that occur mostly at the N- and C-terminal tail domains. The histone “code” hypothesis (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6533) Google Scholar, 3Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2003; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) has been put forward to explain the seemingly complex nature of the reported patterns of histone modifications. Formally, this hypothesis states that a specific histone modification, or combination of modifications, can affect distinct downstream cellular events by altering the structure of chromatin and/or generating a binding platform for effector proteins, which specifically recognize the modification(s) and initiate events that lead to gene transcription or silencing. Expanding the scope of this code, a large number of variant histones has been identified, including some that are unique to vertebrates and some that are highly conserved among all eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 4Malik H.S. Henikoff S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 882-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, characterization of Drosophila and Arabidopsis histones by mass spectrometry (MS) revealed enrichment of modifications associated with transcriptional activity, such as methylation of lysine 4 (Lys4) and Lys79 and acetylation of Lys14, Lys18, and Lys23, in H3.3 compared with H3.2 (7McKittrick E.

These results suggest that, at least in plant and Drosophila cells, H3.2 and its variant H3.3 play different roles in remodeling chromatin, in part by altering covalent histone modification patterns associated with transcriptional silencing and activation. replication-dependent reverse phase-HPLC mass spectrometry replication-independent human embryonic kidney 293 fluorescence-activated cell sorter phosphate-buffered saline Triton-acid-urea retinoic acid. replication-dependent reverse phase-HPLC mass spectrometry replication-independent human embryonic kidney 293 fluorescence-activated cell sorter phosphate-buffered saline Triton-acid-urea retinoic acid. Unlike Drosophila, which contains only two different histone H3 molecules, mammalian cells contain three non-centromeric H3 variants: H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3, which differ only in a few amino acids (see supplemental Fig. 1, A). The function of these three mammalian H3s, especially H3.1 and H3.2, is poorly understood. In this report, we investigate the expression patterns and post-translational modifications associated with these three mammalian H3 variants. Analyses of multiple mammalian cell lines revealed that they can be divided into two groups based upon the relative amounts of the individual H3 variants in chromatin. Although the functional significance of this grouping remains unclear, cellular differentiation appears to alter these ratios in at least one ES cell line in a modest, but reproducible, fashion. We also show that these cell line-specific differences in H3 variant expression do not originate from changes in growth rate, cell cycle stages, or chromosomal ploidy. Possible mechanisms are discussed. Additionally, the different human H3 variants were subjected to quantitative tandem MS analyses. As expected from studies in Drosophila (7McKittrick E. Gafken P.R. Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), transcriptionally active marks are associated with H3.3; those often associated with gene silencing, e.g. Lys27 di- and trimethylation, are found on H3.2. Surprisingly, H3.1 is enriched both with modifications that are largely associated with gene silencing, e.g. Lys9 dimethylation, as well as those linked to gene activation, e.g. Lys14 acetylation. These data reinforce the general view that alterations in the covalent modification patterns associated with histone variants provide additional regulatory options for epigenomic “indexing” of biological processes, many of which remain unclear. As well, our data lend support to a poorly appreciated notion that H3.1 and H3.2 variants, while highly similar at the level of the primary sequence, differing in only one amino acid position (Cys96 in H3.1 versus Ser96 in H3.2; see supplemental Fig. 1, A), are not equivalent at the level of post-translational modifications. Thus, our studies underscore the potential need for caution when interpreting H3-related studies in mammalian models. Cell Lines and Culture—All mammalian cell lines, with the exception of mouse LF2 cells were grown in Iscove's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell lines used in this study are described under supplemental material and methods. Cell Synchronization—HeLa cells were grown to 70% confluency and treated with 3 mm thymidine for 15 h. Thymidine containing medium was removed, cells washed once with fresh thymidine-free medium and grown for 9 h in regular medium. This process was repeated and then, after release from the double thymidine block, cells were harvested from individual plates every 2 h by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and split into three samples to prepare for cell cycle analysis by FACS and isolation of RNA and histones (see below). Preparation of Histones—Nuclei and histones were isolated as described earlier (9Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Kauer M. Baker S.P. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6344-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Cell nuclei were isolated by hypotonic lysis in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Pelleted nuclei were acid-extracted using 0.4 n sulfuric acid, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in water. Reverse Phase HPLC (RP-HPLC)—Separation of mammalian core histones by RP-HPLC was done as described (9Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Kauer M. Baker S.P. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6344-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, acid-extracted histones were separated by RP-HPLC on a C8 column (220 by 4.6 mm Aquapore RP-300, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a linear ascending gradient of 35–60% solvent B (solvent A: 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B: 90% acetonitrile) over 75 min at 1.0 ml/min on a Beckman Coulter System Gold 126 Pump Module and 166/168 Detector. Under these conditions histones H3 split into two peaks. The H3-containing fractions were dried under vacuum and stored at -80 °C. RP-HPLC fractions were resuspended in water, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and control-stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The identified fractions were then subjected to MS analysis. Two-dimensional Triton-Acid-Urea (TAU) Gels—Total histones were dried under vacuum and resuspended in loading buffer (6 m urea, 0.02% (w/v) pyronin Y, 5% (v/v) acetic acid, 12.5 mg/ml protamin sulfate). Samples were separated on TAU mini-gels (15% PAGE, 6 m urea, 5% acetic acid, 0.37% Triton X-100; 300 V in 5% acetic acid for 1.5 h). Lanes containing the samples were cut out, adjusted in 0.125 m Tris, pH 6.6, and the TAU gel slice was assembled on top of a 15% SDS-PAGE mini-gel. After the run, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and destained with 5% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid overnight. The gels were scanned and quantified using Image Gauge software (Science Lab), with the subtraction of background staining. Growth Rate Analysis—1 × 105 cells (HeLa and HEK293) were grown in 6-well plates, and every 24 h samples were collected and counted, with exclusion of dead cells (staining with Trypan Blue). Half of the cells were discarded to avoid contact inhibition of the cells as they become too confluent, fresh medium was added, and the cells were allowed to grow for another 24 h before the next sample was collected. With this method, we could measure the doubling time of HeLa and HEK293 cells while still maintaining them at normal confluency (i.e. the same confluency at which we grow them for all other experiments). Cell numbers were calculated to present the cell growth over days of both cell lines. HeLa and HEK293 cells were seeded as duplicates, and this experiment was performed twice. Cell Cycle Analysis by FACS—1 × 106 cells were collected, washed with PBS, and fixed overnight at -20 °C in 70% ethanol, diluted in PBS. The next day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS containing RNase A (10 μg/ml), followed by the addition of propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) and another incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACSort instrument (BD Immunocytometry Systems) with the exclusion of doublets. Analysis of the results was performed with CellQuest software (BD Bioscience). Immunoblots—Acid-extracted histones were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE mini-gels and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred onto poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes (Millipore), and stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to ensure proper protein transfer. After incubation with primary antibody (anti-H3 S28P: 1:1000 (Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-H3: 1:10000; Abcam)) and addition of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), membranes were incubated with ECL-Plus substrate (Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were detected by exposure to x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences). Sample Preparation of Histone H3 Variants for MS—Purified histone H3 protein from pooled RP-HPLC fractions were derivatized by treatment with propionyl anhydride reagent (8Johnson L. Mollah S. Garcia B.A. Muratore T.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Jacobsen S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6511-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The reagent was created using 75 μl of MeOH and 25 μl of propionic anhydride (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI). Equal volumes of reagent and each H3 variant were mixed and allowed to react at 51 °C for 15 min. Propionylated histone H3s were then digested with trypsin (Promega) at a substrate/enzyme ratio of 20:1 for 5 h at 37°C after dilution of the sample with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer solution (pH 8). The reaction was quenched by the addition of concentrated acetic acid and freezing. A second round of propionylation was then performed to propionylate the newly created peptide N termini. Mass Spectrometry—Propionylated histone digest mixtures were loaded onto capillary precolumns (360 μm outer diameter × 75 μm inner diameter, Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) packed with irregular C18 resin (5–20 μm, YMC Inc., Wilmington, NC) and washed with 0.1% acetic acid for 10 min. Precolumns were connected with Teflon tubing to analytical columns (360 μm outer diameter × 50 μm inner diameter, Polymicro Technologies) packed with regular C18 resin (5 μm, YMC Inc.) structured with an integrated electrospray tip as previously described (10Martin S.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Marto J.A. Anal Chem. 2000; 72: 4266-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by nanoflow HPLC-μ-electrospray ionization on a linear quadrupole ion trap-Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (LTQ-FT-ICR) mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). The gradient used on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC solvent delivery system (Palo Alto, CA) consisted of 0–40% B in 60 min, 45–100% B in 15 min (A, 0.1% acetic acid, B, 70% acetonitrile in 0.1% acetic acid) or other similar gradients. The LTQ-FT mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode with the 10 most abundant ions being isolated and fragmented in the linear ion trap. All MS/MS spectra were manually interpreted. Stable Isotope Labeling for Relative Quantitative Analysis—For a differential expression comparison of histone post-translational modifications from the three H3 variants, stable isotope labeling based on conversion of peptide carboxylic groups to their corresponding methyl esters was used (11Syka J.E. Marto J.A. Bai D.L. Horning S. Senko M.W. Schwartz J.C. Ueberheide B. Garcia B. Busby S. Muratore T. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). First, all samples were dried to dryness by lyophilization. Aliquots of solutions from propionylated histone peptides from H3.1, H3.2, or H3.3 were converted to d0-methyl esters by reconstituting the lyophilized sample in 100 μl of 2 m d0-methanol/HCl, or converted to d3-ethyl esters by reconstituting the lyophilized sample in 100 μlof2 m d4-methanol/HCl. Reaction mixtures were allowed to stand for 1 h at room temperature. Methyl ester solvent was removed from each sample by lyophilization, and the procedures were repeated using a second 100-μl aliquot of methyl ester reagents. Solvent was then removed again by lyophilization, and samples were dissolved in 20 μl of 0.1% acetic acid. Aliquots of each solution were then equally mixed for comparative analysis by MS. Quantitative PCR—Total RNA isolation was performed using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Single-stranded cDNA was generated with the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR green dye according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). HeLa cDNA was used to generate a standard curve from which the amount of cDNA amplified in each sample was determined as indicated. mRNA levels were normalized to H3.2 mRNA expression. All oligos were synthesized by Sigma, and the sequences of the primer pairs for quantitative PCR used in this study are listed under supplemental material and methods. Only mammalian cells contain three different non-centromeric H3 variants: RD H3.1 and H3.2 variants versus a single RI H3.3. Other organisms contain only one type of H3, H3.3 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), or two, H3.2 and H3.3 (e.g. Arabidopsis, Xenopus, and Drosophila) (supplemental Fig. 1A, top). The three mammalian H3 variants are almost identical in their amino acids sequence (see supplemental Fig. 1, A, bottom). H3.1 and H3.2 have only a single amino acid difference (amino acid 96, cysteine/serine, respectively; gray box), whereas H3.1 and H3.3 differ in five amino acids (amino acid 31, alanine/serine; amino acid 87, serine/alanine; amino acid 89, valine/isoleucine; amino acid 90, methionine/glycine; amino acid 96, cysteine/serine, respectively). Because there are no available antibodies that distinguish the three mammalian H3 variants, the investigation of endogenous expression of these variants is restricted largely to chromatographic and electrophoretic separations (7McKittrick E. Gafken P.R. Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 9Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Kauer M. Baker S.P. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6344-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17157-17161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to test whether the different mammalian H3 variants are present in similar abundance in different cell types, we first turned to a chromatographic method. Acid-extracted total histones from different mammalian cell lines were resolved by RP-HPLC; two distinctive H3 peaks were typically observed (supplemental Fig. 1, A). Based on the H3 RP-HPLC profiles, we were able to separate mammalian cell lines into two groups (A and B) based on their peak height (absorbance) and peak area differences. Interestingly, members of group A show an absorbance that is higher for peak 2 than peak 1; a reverse relationship is evident for group B (i.e. an absorbance that is higher for peak 1 than peak 2 (supplemental Fig. 1, C). To gain further insight into the protein compositions of the two RP-HPLC peaks, MS was employed (supplemental Fig. 2). Our MS analyses demonstrate that the first fractions of peak 1 contain H3.2, and the later “shoulder” fractions contain H3.3; peak 2, in contrast, contains almost entirely H3.1 variant (supplemental Fig. 2 and supplemental Tables 1–3). To confirm the observed cell type-specific H3 differences and to additionally identify the expression levels of each H3 variant in the different cell lines examined, we separated acid-extracted histones on two-dimensional TAU gels (Fig. 1A) and visualized the histones by staining with Coomassie Blue. Three of the histone spots also stained with H3 specific antibodies (data not shown). To determine the identity of the variant in each of the three H3 spots, each protein sample was digested in gel and the resulting peptides were then characterized by tandem MS as described above (data not shown and Fig. 1A). Two-dimensional TAU gels were then employed to examine the distribution of H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 in six different mammalian cell lines, three from each of the group A and B categories (Fig. 1B). We find that cell lines from group A are enriched in H3.1 and those in group B are enriched in H3.3. Next, we quantified the proportion of protein in each of the different H3 spots using Image Gauge software (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, while the proportion of H3.2 (dark gray bars) did not change dramatically between the two different groups, cell lines from group A were enriched in H3.1 (light gray bars). In contrast, cell lines from group B contained less or equal proportions of H3.1 compared with H3.3 protein (black bars). Furthermore, as seen before by RP-HPLC analysis (supplemental Fig. 1), several modest changes in H3 variant composition were observed in murine ES cells (LF2) that were treated with retinoic acid (RA) to induce neuronal differentiation (Fig. 1C, see LF2 columns). First, an immediate increase in H3.3 and a corresponding drop in H3.1 occurred during the first 6 days of treatment, whereas H3.2 levels remained largely the same. However, by day 10 post-RA treatment, when the majority of the ES cells have taken on a neuronal phenotype, the levels of H3.2 increased marginally and the levels of H3.3 dropped slightly, whereas the levels of H3.1 remained about the same. These results confirm and extend the observations made by RP-HPLC (supplemental Fig. 1, C). Because all cell lines from group A are derived from cancer cells, we wondered whether the high level of H3.1 expression arises from differences in chromosomal ploidy. Therefore, we used RP-HPLC to separate histones from mouse embryonic fibroblast cells where the chromosomal status was either diploid (P-CUT MEF) or tetraploid (10T1/2). Results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1D. Both of these cell lines had equal peak area ratios in RP-HPLC analysis and were assigned to group B because the observed ratio of peak areas (peak 1/peak 2) was 3. We then separated the H3 variants by two-dimensional TAU gels and found that the levels of H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 were very similar between diploid (P-CUT MEF) and tetraploid (10T1/2) cell lines (Fig. 1E). H3.3 was the most highly expressed variant in both cell lines, followed by H3.1 and then H3.2. These results suggest that ploidy is not responsible for the different expression levels observed for H3 variant proteins. However, because differences in the peak 1/peak 2 ratio were observed in human (group A) versus mouse (group B) species (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1), we cannot rule out the formal possibility that variable copy numbers of the H3.1 and H3.2 genes might contribute, at least in part, to some of the differences in H3 variant expression profiles. Another explanation for the above observations is that cells from embryonic origin contain high levels of H3.3, and cells derived from adult tissue have more H3.1. Because H3.1 and H3.2 are expressed only in S-phase whereas H3.3 is expressed and incorporated into chromatin independent of the cell cycle (5Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), we next wondered whether the observed differences in H3 variant expression arise from differences in growth rates and/or time spent in S-phase. Therefore, we tested a representative cell line from group A and B (HeLa and HEK293, respectively) in growth assays and cell cycle analyses. While somewhat variable, these cells showed a similar growth curve (Fig. 2A), and similar numbers of cells in S-phase by FACS analysis (Fig. 2B). It is also important to note that the growth rates of cell lines within a single group was very different, e.g. within group A, HT-29 grew extremely slowly, whereas Raji cells grew extremely fast (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the observed differences in the proportions of the three H3 variant proteins between groups A and B are not likely explained by the RD expression of H3.1 and H3.2 alone. We wondered whether differences in the proportion of H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 between group A and B cells originated from differences in steady state levels of mRNA expression. To address this possibility, we performed quantitative analyses of mRNA expression levels of five human cell lines used in this study. We could not include other cell lines from group B in this study, because these are of mouse origin and differ in their nucleotide sequence from human H3 variant genes. Fig. 2, C and D show the mRNA expression levels of one H3.2, nine different H3.1, and both H3.3A and H3.3B genes normalized to 18 S rRNA expression. Because we do not know if the 18 S rRNA expression level is the same in all human cell lines examined, we also normalized our data to H3.2 mRNA expression because the proportion of H3.2 protein did not change as drastically between groups A and B compared with H3.1 and H3.3 protein (supplemental Fig. 3). Because it is still possible that different cell lines express different amounts of 18 S rRNA, these results should be viewed with caution. Nonetheless, we observed a similar pattern in H3 variant gene expression when normalized to 18S rRNA expression (Fig. 2, C and D) as when normalized to H3.2 gene expression (supplemental Fig. 3). Interestingly, H3.1 genes of the five different human cell lines were expressed at relative low level and did not exhibit dramatic differences in their expression, with the exception of CEM cells, which seem to express H3.1C. On the other hand, HEK293 cells, which belong to group B, showed a reproducible increase in the expression level of H3.3A (almost 2-fold compared with other human cell lines from group A). The lack of significant differences in growth rates from HEK293 and HeLa cells together with the mRNA expression data suggest that the differences in H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 protein expression that we observed by both RP-HPLC and two-dimensional TAU gel analyses might originate at the transcriptional level and are independent of growth rates. Because we observed slight differences in the proportions of cells in G1 or G2/M between HeLa and HEK293 cells, we wondered if cell cycle phases could account for the observed differences in H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 proportions between HeLa and HEK293 cell lines. We therefore performed a detailed analysis of H3 variant expression on both mRNA and protein levels during G1, S, and G2/M phases in HeLa cells. The results from one of two independently conducted, highly reproducible experiments are shown in Fig. 3. HeLa cells were synchronized in G1 by a double thymidine block and released from this block to continue through different cell cycle phases. Every 2 h, cells were harvested and samples prepared for cell cycle analysis by FACS, mRNA isolation, and cDNA generation or acid-extraction of histones. Fig. 3A shows the cell cycle profile of these cells analyzed by FACS, and quantitative analysis of the amount of cells in each cell phase is depicted in Fig. 3B. The majority of asynchronously growing cells was found to be in G1 (∼75%), but also cells in S and G2/M phase were observed. Treatment of HeLa cells with Nocodazole led to an arrest in G2/M (∼50%). ∼75% of cells were found to be i"

These drastic defects were selectively rescued by additional deletion of NCAM, demonstrating that they originate from a gain of NCAM functions because of polySia deficiency. The data presented in this study reveal that the essential role of polySia resides in the control and coordination of NCAM interactions during mouse brain development.

Moreover, this first demonstration in vivo that a highly specific glycan structure is more important than the glycoconjugate as a whole provides a novel view on the relevance of protein glycosylation for the complex process of building the vertebrate brain. The cellular glycosylation machinery is a most impressive example of how cells enhance structural and functional complexity by use of only limited parts (<10%) of the genome. Glycans conjugated to lipids and proteins form the glycocalyx, the outer rim and prominent communication structure of animal cells (1Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 2Haltiwanger R.S. Lowe J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Their paramount importance is emphasized by the growing group of congenital disorders of glycosylation, which manifest as severe multisystemic diseases including neuropathological symptoms (3Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Poly-α2,8-linked sialic acid (polySia) 3The abbreviations used are: polySiapolysialic acidNCAMneural cell adhesion moleculeANOVAanalysis of variancePpostnatal day (e.g. P1).3The abbreviations used are: polySiapolysialic acidNCAMneural cell adhesion moleculeANOVAanalysis of variancePpostnatal day (e.g. P1). is a unique glycan added to the neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM, and is known to exert an important influence on the development and function of the nervous system (4Rutishauser U.

The intriguing role assigned to polySia in promoting neurogenesis, migration, axon outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity has been explained predominantly by a negative regulation of cell-cell interactions due to the stereochemical properties of the large polyanion (shown schematically in Fig. 1A) (4Rutishauser U.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31745-31751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recent x-ray and neutron reflectivity data as well as direct force measurements confirm that an increased intermembrane repulsion in the presence of polySia overcomes homophilic NCAM binding and attenuates cadherin-dependent adhesion (8Johnson C.P. Fragneto G. Konovalov O. Dubosclard V. Legrand J.F. Leckband D.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Rutishauser U. Leckband D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). On the other hand, polySia is known to exert highly specific functions. For instance, NCAM trans-interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans involved in the formation and remodeling of hippocampal synapses depend on the presence of polySia (10Storms S.D. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27124-27129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Dityatev A. Dityateva G. Sytnyk V. Delling M. Toni N. Nikonenko I. Muller D. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9372-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Finally, competition experiments carried out with exogenously added polySia indicate that the carbohydrate polymer mediates autonomous, NCAM-independent functions. These concern the development of commissural axons in zebrafish (12Marx M. Rutishauser U. Bastmeyer M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 4949-4958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the strengthening of neuronal responses to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (13Vutskits L. Djebbara-Hannas Z.

NCAM deficiency is accompanied by the loss of polySia (15Cremer H. Lange R. Christoph A. Plomann M. Vopper G. Roes J. Brown R. Baldwin S. Kraemer P. Scheff S. Barthels D. Rajewsky K. Willie W.

Dickmanns A. Mühlenhoff M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Ficner R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Combined, these findings led to the conclusion that polySia and not NCAM is the missing factor (18Ono K. Tomasiewicz H. Magnuson T. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1994; 13: 595-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 19Becker C.G. Artola A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Decker T. Welzl H. Schachner M. J. Neurosci.

Processes that can be disrupted by endo-N-acetylneuraminidase treatment are: (i) tangential migration of subventricular zone-derived neuroblasts along the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb (18Ono K. Tomasiewicz H. Magnuson T. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1994; 13: 595-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar); (ii) lamination of the mossy fiber tract (22Seki T. Rutishauser U. J.

Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); and (v) generation of the circadian locomotor rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (21Shen H. Watanabe M. Tomasiewicz H. Rutishauser U. Magnuson T. Glass J.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5221-5229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of polySia is the result of two polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia-II and ST8Sia-IV (23Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Angata K. Fukuda M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The two enzymes are highly conserved, but their time- and tissue-specific expression is independently regulated. ST8Sia-II is the dominating enzyme in the embryonic and early postnatal mouse, whereas ST8Sia-IV prevails in the adult (25Hildebrandt H. Becker C. Mürau M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Rahmann H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Ong E. Nakayama J. Angata K. Reyes L. Katsuyama T. Arai Y. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The genetic ablation of St8sia-IV, therefore, generated mice in which the polySia synthesis was not significantly altered during development but almost completely absent in the adult (27Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, depletion of St8sia-II generated animals with ongoing polySia synthesis in the adult brain (28Angata K. Long J.M. Bukalo O. Lee W. Dityatev A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Schachner M. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32603-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Both strains were born at Mendelian frequency, were fertile, and did not show gross anatomical abnormalities. Although distinct deficits have been identified in histological, electrophysiological, and behavioral analyses (27Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Angata K. Long J.M. Bukalo O. Lee W. Dityatev A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Schachner M. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32603-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the data available today strongly suggest that each gene partially compensates for the absence of the other. Information on the individual roles of NCAM and polySia during ontogeny is completely unavailable. Here we describe the phenotype of mice expressing normal NCAM levels in the absence of polySia, as obtained by simultaneous ablation of St8sia-II and St8sia-IV. The absence of polySia confers a lethal phenotype with specific defects of major brain fiber tracts. Phenotypic alterations that occurred in addition to those observed in NCAM-knock-out mice were completely reversed in triple knock-out animals lacking NCAM in addition to both polysialyltransferase genes. Collectively, our data demonstrate that polySia is essential in steering NCAM functions during development of the nervous system. Mice—All protocols for animal use were in compliance with German law and approved by the animal welfare commission of the Universität Hohenheim. St8sia-II and St8sia-IV single knock-out strains, which have been backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice for at least six generations, were intercrossed to obtain double heterozygous St8sia-II+/– St8sia-IV+/– animals. To generate all different allelic combinations St8sia-II+/– St8sia-IV+/– were backcrossed to St8sia-II+/+ St8sia-IV–/– or St8sia-II–/– St8sia-IV+/+, respectively, and resulting St8sia-II+/– St8sia-IV–/– mice were bred with St8sia-II–/– St8sia-IV+/–. Wild-type mice were obtained from crosses between St8siaII+/+ St8siaIV+/– or between St8siaII+/– St8siaIV+/+. Triple knock-out mice deficient in NCAM and polysialyltransferase between intercrosses genes were obtained by St8sia-II+/– St8sia-IV–/– and Ncam–/– mice and subsequent backcrosses. All offspring were born in the expected Mendelian ratios. Genotyping was performed by PCR using the following primers: NCAM1 (5′-CTGCCTCAGATAGTGACCCAGTGC-3′), NCAM2 (5′-CGGAGAACCTGCGTGCAATCCATC-3′), and NCAM3 (5′-TTGGAGGCAGGGAGCTGACCACAT-3′) to amplify Ncam; SWB8 (5′-ATGTCTGGAAAGGAATGGATGTCT-3′), SWF13 (5′-AACGCTTTACCAACTGTGCTATCT-3′), and SWB14 (5′-TTGGGGTCTTGTGGTAAATCAGTC-3′) to amplify St8sia-II; LW13 (5'-CTCAGTTCTGGCTATTTCTTTTGT-3′), LW4 (5′-GAGCTCACAACGACTCTCCGAGC-3′), and LW18 (5′-ACCGCGAGGCGGTTTTCTCCGGC-3′) to amplify St8sia-IV. Western Blot Analysis—Total brain isolated from mice on postnatal day 1 was homogenized in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 70 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2% Triton X-100). Detergent extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and one aliquot was treated with 20 ng μl–1 endoneuraminidase (17Stummeyer K. Dickmanns A. Mühlenhoff M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Ficner R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) for 45 min on ice. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (40 μg total protein per lane) and electroblotted on nitrocellulose transfer membranes. Equal loading and protein transfer were controlled by Ponceau S staining. After the dye was removed (washing in water), immunostaining was carried out using anti-polySia antibody 735 or anti-NCAM antibody KD11 in a concentration of 2.5 μg ml–1. Bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Tissue Preparation, Histology, and Immunohistochemistry—P0–P4 postnatal mice were anesthetized by hypothermia and killed by rapid decapitation. Brains were removed and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde for several days before dissection. Older mice were deeply anesthetized with 20 ml/kg 1.5% ketamine, 0.2% xylazine in normal saline (0.9% NaCl) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde before brains were removed and postfixed overnight. Brains were embedded in 4% agar-agar (Roth) and cut into 50-μm serial sections using a vibrating microtome. Unstained free-floating vibratome sections were examined with a stereomicroscope (Zeiss SV 11) under modified dark field illumination. For standard histological examination, sections were air dried onto Superfrost Plus slides (Menzel Gläser), dehydrated and stained with cresyl violet/thionine (Nissl stain). Immunofluorescence staining of free-floating vibratome sections was performed with polyclonal rabbit anti-calbindin (Swant) and AlexaFluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Micrographs were archived digitally using AxioVision version 3.1 software (Zeiss). Morphometric Measurements—Area and length measurements were performed on digital images using NIH ImageJ. To address the dimensions of the anterior commissure, the anterior and posterior limbs were followed on coronal serial sections, and diameters were measured perpendicular to their trajectory at the level of midline crossing (if applicable) to jointly assess both limbs, and directly rostral or caudal of the branching point for separate measurements of the anterior and posterior limbs, respectively. The rostrocaudal extent of the internal capsule was calculated as the product of the number of coronal sections on which the internal capsule was present multiplied by the thickness of the sections (50 μm). The cross-sectional areas of the corticospinal and mammillothalamic tracts were measured as illustrated in the respective figures (see “Results”), and for each animal the mean values of the left and right tracts were calculated. DiI Tracing—DiI (Molecular Probes) was applied on fixed brains cut in coronal orientation from rostral up to the desired level. Crystals of DiI were placed unilaterally on the pars externa of the anterior olfactory nucleus to mark the anterior commissure or on the medullary pyramids to label the corticospinal tract of the hindbrain. After incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 weeks at 37 °C, 100-μm vibratome sections were cut in horizontal or coronal planes and examined with a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica MZ FLIII). Statistics—Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism software. For comparisons of more than two groups, one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test as a post-test (two-tailed) was applied. Chi-square tests were used to assess frequency distributions or to compare actual with expected frequencies. Polysialyltransferase-deficient Mice Exhibit a Lethal Phenotype—Mice with single inactivation of the polysialyltransferase genes, St8sia-II (II–/–) (28Angata K. Long J.M. Bukalo O. Lee W. Dityatev A.

Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were cross-bred. Offspring from double-heterozygous animals (II+/–IV+/–; F6 backcross on C57BL/6J mice) were further intercrossed and yielded all expected genotypes including mice doubly deficient for the polysialyltransferases (II–/–IV–/–). Western blot analysis was used to display the expression of polySia (Fig. 1B, upper panel) and NCAM (Fig. 1B, lower panel) in brain homogenates of postnatal day 1 (P1) pups. Mice of all genotypes except II–/–IV–/– retained polySia-immunoreactivity. The complete absence of polySia in II–/–IV–/– animals excluded the existence of a third polysialyltransferase that could modify NCAM. Consistent with the high expression level of ST8Sia-II in perinatal animals (24Angata K. Fukuda M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Hildebrandt H.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the absence of ST8Sia-II (Fig. 1B, II–/–IV+/+ and II–/–IV+/–) lowers the polySia content more drastically than the absence of ST8Sia-IV (Fig. 1B, II+/+IV–/– and II+/–IV–/–). NCAM protein expression, in contrast, is not affected by the lack of polySia synthesis. The two major NCAM isoforms expressed at P1, NCAM-180 and –140 (29He H.T. Finne J. Goridis C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2489-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), are present at similar level in all genotypes (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Polysialyltransferase double-null offspring (II–/–IV–/–) were born overtly normal and at a Mendelian frequency (Fig. 1, C and E). However, during the first weeks of postnatal development, animals failed to thrive (Fig. 1, D and F), whereas littermates of all other genotypes including animals with only one functional polysialyltransferase allele (II–/–IV+/– or II+/–IV–/–) showed growth in the range of the wild type. After 3 weeks of age, about 50% of the II–/–IV–/– animals died, and less than 20% survived >4 weeks (Fig. 1E). Along with the growth retardation, polysialyltransferase double mutants appeared increasingly cachectic and revealed severe deficits in simple tests of motor coordination, strength, and balance. For example, II–/–IV–/– animals were unable to hang upside down on a standard wire cage lid or to balance on a horizontal pole. Apart from cachexia, with reduced mass of fatty tissue and limb muscles, histological screens of other hematoxylin-eosin-stained tissue sections (heart, lung, stomach, pancreas, gut, liver, spleen, and kidney) did not show obvious abnormalities. In contrast to the dramatically affected development of polysialyltransferase-deficient mice, N–/– offspring derived from N+/– × N+/– crossings had physically normal development, with only a slight reduction of body weight (Fig. 1G), and matched the expected Mendelian distribution at the age of 4 weeks (n = 27, 54, 24 for N+/+, N+/–, and N–/–; p > 0.8, chi-square test).

Shared defects concern: (i) small olfactory bulbs (Fig. 2, see also Fig. 4B); (ii) a massive accumulation of cells in the proximal part of the rostral migratory stream (Fig. 2D); and (iii) the defasciculation and aberrant lamination of the mossy fiber tract (Fig. 3). Beyond that, II–/–IV–/– mice have unique defects including postnatal growth retardation and precocious death, and as will be demonstrated below (Figs. 4, 5, 6), they exhibit massive hydrocephalus and abnormalities of major brain fiber tracts.FIGURE 4Formation of hydrocephalus in II–/–IV–/– mice.

Recent evidence suggests that an emerging class of enzymes containing a conserved patatin domain are centrally important players in lipid degradation. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a major triglyceride lipase of the adipose triglyceride lipase/Brummer family, Tgl4, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Elimination of Tgl4 in a tgl3 background led to fat yeast, rendering growing cells unable to degrade triglycerides. Tgl4 and Tgl3 lipases localized to lipid droplets, independent of each other. Serine 315 in the GXSXG lipase active site consensus sequence of the patatin domain of Tgl4 is essential for catalytic activity. Mouse adipose triglyceride lipase (which also contains a patatin domain but is otherwise highly divergent in primary structure from any yeast protein) localized to lipid droplets when expressed in yeast, and significantly restored triglyceride breakdown in tgl4 mutants in vivo. Our data identify yeast Tgl4 as a functional ortholog of mammalian adipose triglyceride lipase.

First, they represent a most efficient way to store energy in the form of fatty acids (FA). Second, diglycerides (DG) liberated from TG by cleavage of a single fatty acyl ester bond, may serve as precursors for re-esterification to membrane phospholipids. Third, TG synthesis may also function as a sink to remove excess free fatty acids from the cellular milieu, in order to prevent FA-induced lipotoxicity. Because TG precursors or degradation products, such as phosphatidic acid or DG species, are also potential second messengers involved in multiple signaling processes, both TG synthesis and breakdown obviously require a stringent spatial and temporal control (1Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Fueled by the epidemic dimensions of lipid-associated disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (2Flier J.S. Cell. 2003; 116: 337-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 3Friedman J.M.

Ser. 2000; 894 (and 1-253): i-xiiPubMed Google Scholar), numerous research strategies are focused toward understanding the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms that regulate uptake, synthesis, deposition, and mobilization of lipids, in the context of energy homeostasis (5Bell C.G.

Because of the complexity of the problem, major input in this endeavor comes from the use of model systems, including mice, flies (Drosophila), worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) or yeast. triglyceride adipose triglyceride lipase hormone-sensitive lipase monoglyceride lipase diglyceride endoplasmic reticulum steryl esters fatty acid glutathione S-transferase triglyceride lipase lipid droplets green fluorescent protein. triglyceride adipose triglyceride lipase hormone-sensitive lipase monoglyceride lipase diglyceride endoplasmic reticulum steryl esters fatty acid glutathione S-transferase triglyceride lipase lipid droplets green fluorescent protein. In yeast, mobilization of fat depots occurs as a consequence of at least three different metabolic stimuli: in stationary phase, upon nutrient depletion, fatty acids are released from TG depots rather slowly and are subjected to peroxisomal β-oxidation, providing the metabolic energy for cellular maintenance (8Hiltunen J.K. Mursula A.M. Rottensteiner H. Wierenga R.K. Kastaniotis A.J. Gurvitz A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 35-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Alternatively, lipid depots are degraded very rapidly in cells that exit starvation conditions, e.g. from the stationary phase, and enter a vegetative growth cycle upon supplementation with carbohydrates (9Gray J.V. Petsko G.A. Johnston G.C. Ringe D. Singer R.A. Werner-Washburne M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Because peroxisomes are repressed under these conditions, storage lipid compounds including steryl esters (SE) and TG may rather be utilized for membrane lipid synthesis to support rapid initiation of cellular growth and division (10Trotter P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11van Roermund C.W. Waterham H.R. Ijlst L. Wanders R.J. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2003; 60: 1838-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Lipolysis is essential also in the absence of cellular growth in diploid cells undergoing meiosis and sporulation. For instance, phospholipase D (Spo14) (12Honigberg S.M. Conicella C. Espositio R.E. Genetics. 1992; 130: 703-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or steryl ester hydrolase Tgl1 (13Jandrositz A.

Acta. 2005; 1735: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) are important for remodeling the lipid content for nuclear membrane and pro-spore membrane formation, and the respective homozygous diploid mutants are unable to sporulate. Obviously, exposure to different nutritional conditions requires the activity of multiple lipases to rapidly adjust cellular lipid pools. In mammalian cells, invertebrates, as well as in plants and fungi, including baker's yeast, triglycerides and steryl esters are packaged into lipid droplets (LD) (14Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), which are “organelles” consisting of neutral fat surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer (15Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In yeast, LD are believed to form by budding from the endoplasmic reticulum, which also harbors most of the enzymes required for sterol synthesis and esterification, and TG formation (16Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Natter K. Leitner P. Faschinger A. Wolinski H. McCraith S. Fields S. Kohlwein S.D.

Yeast. 2005; 22: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Enzymes involved in TG and SE synthesis are remarkably conserved. The (re) acylation of diglyceride to triglyceride is carried out by two different enzymes in yeast, Dga1, which is an ortholog of mammalian DGAT2 (acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase) (19Cases S.

Yeast Lro1 is about 27% homologous to mammalian lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase, LCAT (23Dahlqvist A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Lro1 and Dga1 account for the majority of the yeast TG synthesis capacity, with some minor contribution also by Are1, the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-related enzyme, preferentially catalyzing steryl ester synthesis. Elimination of LRO1, DGA1, and ARE1 genes altogether renders yeast cells incapable of any detectable TG synthesis. The recent discovery of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) as the major lipase acting on TG in mouse adipocytes (Ref. 25Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar; also termed desnutrin, Ref. 26Villena J.A. Roy S. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47066-47075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) supports the notion that our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling TG homeostasis in the cell is incomplete. ATGL operates in conjunction with hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which was found to preferentially function as a diglyceride hydrolase (27Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Monoglyceride lipase (MGL) catalyzes the final step in complete TG breakdown to free fatty acids and glycerol. Both enzymes, ATGL and HSL, act in concert to ensure efficient TG hydrolysis without DG accumulation, in adipocytes. Interestingly, ATGL contains a patatin domain (Pfam01734), originally identified in patatin, the major protein of potato tubers (28Shewry P.R. Ann. Bot. (Lond). 2003; 91: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which displays esterolytic and phospholipase activity. Patatin lacks a typical catalytic triad, characteristic for most lipases identified so far (29Brady L. Brzozowski A.M. Derewenda Z.S. Dodson E. Dodson G. Tolley S. Turkenburg J.P. Christiansen L.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and, instead, contains a catalytic diad, consisting of serine and aspartate residues, as deduced from its crystal structure (33Rydel T.J. Williams J.M. Krieger E. Moshiri F. Stallings W.C. Brown S.M. Pershing J.C. Purcell J.P. Alibhai M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6696-6708Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Although the primary sequence of the patatin domain is only poorly conserved, multiple proteins harboring this domain appear as an emerging class of enzymes in all types of eukaryotic cells, for most of which, however, a specific function has not been unveiled yet (35Zechner R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Very recently the Drosophila ortholog of ATGL, Brummer lipase (encoded by bmm) was identified in a genome-wide screen for genes that are nutritionally regulated. Brummer localizes to lipid droplets, and fly embryos lacking both maternal or zygotic Brummer activity are inviable, demonstrating an essential function of this enzyme in flies (36Gronke S. Mildner A. Fellert S. Tennagels N. Petry S. Muller G. Jackle H. Kuhnlein R.P. Cell. Metabolism. 2005; 1: 323-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Whereas enzymes involved in TG synthesis in yeast appear both structurally and functionally conserved to mammalian cells, the level of sequence conservation for TG-degrading enzymes is less pronounced. Although the recently characterized Tgl1 protein of yeast displays more than 30% sequence identity to mammalian acid lipases, it may function as a steryl ester hydrolase rather than a TG lipase in vivo (13Jandrositz A. Petschnigg J. Zimmermann R. Natter K. Scholze H. Hermetter A. Kohlwein S.D. Leber R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1735: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Koffel R. Tiwari R. Falquet L. Schneiter R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1655-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The only yeast TG lipase identified so far, Tgl3 (38Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23317-23323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), lacks any significant structural homology to known lipases in higher eukaryotes. However, a detailed computational analysis unveiled to us the presence of a patatin domain (Pfam01734) in Tgl3, characteristic also for mammalian ATGL (25Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) and Brummer lipase in Drosophila (36Gronke S. Mildner A. Fellert S. Tennagels N. Petry S. Muller G. Jackle H. Kuhnlein R.P. Cell. Metabolism. 2005; 1: 323-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A second yeast patatin domain-containing protein encoded by reading frame YML059c is a functional ortholog of the mammalian neuropathy target esterase, NTE. Nte1 functions in yeast as an intracellular phospholipase B, involved in deacylation of phosphatidylcholine (39Murray J.P. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8544-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Zaccheo O. Dinsdale D. Meacock P.A. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24024-24033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The observation that two patatin domain-containing proteins encode lipolytic enzymes in yeast prompted us to investigate patatin domain-containing yeast reading frames YKR089c and YOR081c, which are 55% homologous to each other but of unknown function. Here we provide evidence that gene YKR089c indeed encodes a major triglyceride lipase in yeast, which is a functional ortholog of mammalian ATGL, and hence suggest the name TGL4. Strains and Media—Yeast strains used in this study were wild-type BY4742 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0), tgl4 deletion mutant, YCK1156 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 YKR089c::KanMX4), tgl3 mutant, YCK1157 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 YMR313c::kanMX4), tgl4 tgl3 double mutant, YCK1158 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 YKR089c::kanMX4 YMR313c::kanMX4) and a tgl4 tgl3 dga1 lro1 quadruple deletion strain, YCK1159 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met2Δ0 ura3Δ0 YKR089c::KanMX4 YMR313c::KanMX4 YOR245c::KanMX4 YNR008w::KanMX4). The single mutant and the wild-type strains were received from Euroscarf. The double and quadruple mutants were constructed by standard genetic crosses and tetrad dissection, and verified by colony PCR, using gene deletion specific primers (41Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). A yeast strain expressing a full-length chromosomally integrated TGL4-GFP (green fluorescent protein) hybrid was obtained from Invitrogen (42Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). Strain ELO3-GFP, harboring a chromosomally integrated GFP was described previously (43Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.-S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Yeast strains episomally expressing GST-TGL3 and GST-TGL4 were kindly provided by M. Snyder (Yale University). E. coli TOP10F′ ([proAB, laqIq, lacZDM15, Tn10(Tetr)], mcrAΔ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC), phi80ΔlacZM15, ΔlacX74, deoR, recA1, araΔ139D(ara, leu), 7697galU, galK, λ-rps(streptomycinr), endA1, nupG) was used for plasmid amplification and purification. Standard YPD medium contained 1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% glucose (Merck), 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco); minimal medium with 2% galactose (Sigma), or 2% raffinose (Acros Organics) as the carbon sources, contained 0.67% Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco), supplemented with the respective amino acids and bases. Yeast transformants carrying expression plasmids were grown in uracil-free minimal medium. Sporulation medium contained 0.25% yeast extract, 1% potassium acetate, and 0.1% glucose. Ampicillin-resistant E. coli transformants were selected in LBA medium (1% Bacto-tryptone (Difco), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), 0.5% NaCl, 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Amresco)). Geneticin resistance was analyzed on YPD plates containing 200 mg/liter geneticin (G418, Calbiochem). For in vivo TG mobilization experiments, cerulenin (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 10 mg/liter. Expression of GST-ATGL under control of the CUP1 promoter was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm CuSO4 to the medium. Expression of GFP fusions under control of the MET25 promoter was induced in the absence of methionine in the medium. Cloning of the YKR089c/TGL4 Gene into an Expression Vector under Control of the GAL1/10 Promoter—For galactose-regulatable expression in yeast, reading frame YKR089c/TGL4 was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from the wild-type strain BY4742 as the template, with primers 5′-ATCCCCAGCTGATGCATCATCATCATCATCATCATAGCAGCAAAATATCAGATC-3′ and 5′-GCCCGGGATCCTTTTCTTATTGAGTAAAACTGG-3′, introducing a His6 tag at the 5′-end of the reading frame. The amplified fragment was cleaved with PvuII and BamHI and inserted into the respective sites of the expression plasmid, pYES2 (Invitrogen), harboring the URA3 yeast selection marker. All PCR reactions were performed under standard conditions using a proofreading Pwo-DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Putative Serine Active Site—For construction of TGL4-S315G, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using primers, 5′-GGTAGCGGTGCTGGTGCAAT-3′ and 5′-GCACCAGCACCGCTACCACT-3′ to convert the serine 315 coding AGT to GGT (glycine, underlined). The mutated gene was amplified and inserted into the pYES2-plasmid, as described above, and sequenced. Cloning and Expression of Murine ATGL under Control of the CUP1 Promoter in Yeast—For overexpression of GST-ATGL under the control of a yeast CUP1 promoter, murine ATGL was amplified using plasmid pcDNA4/HisMax-ATGL (25Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R.

Construction of TGL3-GFP, TGL4-GFP, and ATGL-GFP Episomal Fusions for Expression in Yeast—For localization studies, reading frames YKR089c/TGL4 and TGL3 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pUG35 vectors, harboring a MET25 promoter and the GFP reading frame 3′ to the multiple cloning site (44Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Yeast wild-type BY4742 genomic DNA was used as the template, and primers 5′-ACGTTACTAGTATGAGCAGCAAAATATCAGATCTTACATC-3′ and 5′-ACGTTGTCGGACTTGAGTAAAACTGGTGGTGTTTTG-3′ for YKR089c/TGL4 amplification, and primers 5′-ACGTAACTAGTATGAAGGAAACGGCGCAGGAATA-3′ and 5′-ACGTAGTCGACCCTACTCCGTCTTGCTCTTATTATGTCGTC-3′ for TGL3 amplification, respectively. The fragments were cleaved with SpeI and SalI and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pUG35, to yield C-terminal GFP fusions. The mouse ATGL reading frame was amplified using pcDNA4/HisMAX-ATGL as the template (25Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) and the same primers as described above, cleaved with BglII, and inserted into the BamHI site of pUG36, for N-terminal GFP fusion (44Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Construction of a Chromosomal FAA4-GFP Fusion—To monitor the kinetics of lipid droplet mobilization in yeast by means of fluorescence microscopy, the major LD protein Faa4 was tagged with GFP. A chromosomally integrated FAA4-GFP fusion was constructed by amplifying the GFP-KanMX6 cassette from plasmid pFA6a-GFP (S65T)-KanMX6 (45Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) with primers, 5′-TCTAGCGGCTGTCAAGCCAGATGTGGAAAGAGTTTATAAAGAAAACACTAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCACTG-3′ and 5′-GATTGATATGGTTGTTTTCGGTGCATGTTTGATTACTAAAAGTTGGGGCATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′. The fragment was transformed into competent yeast BY4742 wild-type cells, and recombinant cells harboring the fragment chromosomally integrated by homologous recombination were selected on YPD plates containing 200 mg/liter geneticin. Correct integration of the GFP cDNA was verified by colony PCR. Lipid Analyses—For total lipid analyses, yeast cells were broken with glass beads in a Merckenschlager homogenizer (B. Braun Biotech International) under CO2 cooling, and lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v) (46Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol.

Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by applying samples onto silica gel plates (Merck) with an automated sampler (Camag Automatic TLC Sampler 4). Total lipids were separated either by using light petroleum/diethyl ether/acetic acid (32:8:0.4, per vol) as the solvent for triglyceride detection, or by using chloroform/acetone/acetic acid (96:4:1, per vol) as the solvent for diglyceride detection. Lipids were visualized on TLC plates by carbonization after dipping plates into 3.2% H2SO4 and 0.5% MnCl2, followed by heating at 120 °C for 30 min. Lipids were quantified by densitometric scanning at 450 nm (Camag TLC scanner 3), using triolein as the standard. Analysis of Triglyceride Degradation in Vivo—To analyze the degradation of triglycerides in vivo, cells were grown for 42 h in minimal medium with 2% galactose (inducing conditions) as the sole carbon source. The main cultures were inoculated to an A600 nm = 2 in 2% galactose medium, supplemented with 10 mg/liter cerulenin from ethanolic stock solutions. Control cells were incubated with the same amount of ethanol (final concentration <1%), without cerulenin. At times indicated, 15-ml aliquots were withdrawn and cells harvested by centrifugation. After washing with distilled H20, cells were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further processing. For lipid extraction and analysis, the frozen pellets were resuspended in chloroform/methanol, disintegrated by vigorous shaking with glass beads in a Merckenschlager homogenizer under CO2 cooling and further processed as described above. Analysis of Triglyceride and Diglyceride Lipase Activity in Vitro—For determination of lipase activities in vitro, strain YCK1159, which is devoid of endogenous TG synthesis and degradation was transformed with plasmids harboring TGL3 or TGL4 reading frames under control of the GAL1/10 promoter, or the empty vector. After induction for 6 h in the presence of 2% galactose, enzyme extracts were prepared by homogenization of cells with glass beads under CO2 cooling and two centrifugation steps at 1000 × g to remove glass beads and unbroken cells. The triglyceride substrate was prepared as follows: 200,000 cpm of [3H]triolein (19.5 Ci/mmol) were dried under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in 75 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and sonicated for 4 min on ice (Virsonic; 475 watts at 100% output). 25 μl of defatted bovine serum albumin (20 mg/ml) were added. Diglyceride substrate was prepared as follows: 660,000 cpm of [3H]diolein (10.5 Ci/mmol) were dried under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in 75 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and 25 μl of 2.5% defatted bovine serum albumin. Cell homogenates (up to 400 μg of total protein) were added to 100 μl of prewarmed substrate solution (30 °C); after brief mixing, 100 μl were immediately withdrawn and extracted with 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). 100-μl aliquots of the incubation mixture were withdrawn after 15, 30, and 45 min of incubation at 30 °C, and extracted with 400 μl of chloroform/methanol for 1 h. The organic phase was removed, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Lipids were separated by TLC using light petroleum/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:2, per vol) as the solvent. Bands were visualized with iodine vapor and triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, and free fatty acids were scraped off the plate. The radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For measuring DG activity in vitro, 100 μl of substrate (∼660,000 cpm) were incubated with cell homogenates (100 μg of protein) in a water bath at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped after 1 h by the addition of 3.25 ml of methanol/chloroform/heptane (10:9:7, per vol) and 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium carbonate, 0.1 m boric acid, pH 10.5. After a centrifugation step (800 × g, 15 min), the radioactivity in 1 ml of the aqueous phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Microscopy—For localization studies, TGL3-GFP-, TGL4-GFP-, and mATGL-GFP-expressing cells were harvested after 12 h of growth in YPD or selective minimal medium, respectively, prior to microscopic inspection. To determine the localization of Tgl4-GFP hybrid proteins in tgl3 deletion strains and vice versa, mutants were transformed with episomal pUG35 plasmids harboring the TGL4-GFP and TGL3-GFP fusion genes under control of the MET25 promoter. Expression was induced on medium lacking methionine. GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and detected in the range between 500 and 525 nm, on a Leica SP2 confocal microscope with spectral detection. Lipid droplets were co-stained with the hydrophobic dye Nile Red (47Kohlwein S.D. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 511-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 48Greenspan P. Mayer E.P.

This setup minimized fluorescence bleed-through of the GFP signal into the Nile Red detection channel, and avoided most of the red-shifted Nile Red fluorescence because of incorporation into membraneous structures (48Greenspan P.

https://openalex.org/W1984769882,"Engrailed-2 (En-2), a homeodomain transcription factor, is expressed in a caudal-to-rostral gradient in the developing midbrain, where it has an instructive role in patterning the optic tectum--the target of topographic retinal input. In addition to its well-known role in regulating gene expression through its DNA-binding domain, En-2 may also have a role in cell-cell communication, as suggested by the presence of other domains involved in nuclear export, secretion and internalization. Consistent with this possibility, here we report that an external gradient of En-2 protein strongly repels growth cones of Xenopus axons originating from the temporal retina and, conversely, attracts nasal axons. Fluorescently tagged En-2 accumulates inside growth cones within minutes of exposure, and a mutant form of the protein that cannot enter cells fails to elicit axon turning. Once internalized, En-2 stimulates the rapid phosphorylation of proteins involved in translation initiation and triggers the local synthesis of new proteins. Furthermore, the turning responses of both nasal and temporal growth cones in the presence of En-2 are blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. The differential guidance of nasal and temporal axons reported here suggests that En-2 may participate directly in topographic map formation in the vertebrate visual system."
https://openalex.org/W2001259227,"Although it is widely accepted that most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres, concrete proof has proved elusive. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), an extremely compact radio source at the centre of our Galaxy, is the best candidate for proof, because it is the closest. Previous very-long-baseline interferometry observations (at 7 mm wavelength) reported that Sgr A* is approximately 2 astronomical units (au) in size, but this is still larger than the 'shadow' (a remarkably dim inner region encircled by a bright ring) that should arise from general relativistic effects near the event horizon of the black hole. Moreover, the measured size is wavelength dependent. Here we report a radio image of Sgr A* at a wavelength of 3.5 mm, demonstrating that its size is approximately 1 au. When combined with the lower limit on its mass, the lower limit on the mass density is 6.5 x 10(21)M(o) pc(-3) (where M(o) is the solar mass), which provides strong evidence that Sgr A* is a supermassive black hole. The power-law relationship between wavelength and intrinsic size (size proportional, variantwavelength(1.09)) explicitly rules out explanations other than those emission models with stratified structure, which predict a smaller emitting region observed at a shorter radio wavelength."

https://openalex.org/W1970078607,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) promotes the destruction of target proteins by attaching to them a ubiquitin chain that is recognized by the 26S proteasome. The UPS influences most cellular processes, and its targets include transcriptional activators that are primary determinants of gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that non-proteolytic functions of the UPS might stimulate transcriptional activity. Here we show that the proteolysis of some transcriptional activators by the UPS can stimulate their function. We focused on the role of UPS-dependent proteolysis in the function of inducible transcriptional activators in yeast, and found that inhibition of the proteasome reduced transcription of the targets of the activators Gcn4, Gal4 and Ino2/4. In addition, mutations in SCF(Cdc4), the ubiquitin ligase for Gcn4 (ref. 5), or mutations in ubiquitin that prevent degradation, also impaired the transcription of Gcn4 targets. These transcriptional defects were manifested despite the enhanced abundance of Gcn4 on cognate promoters. Proteasome inhibition also decreased the association of RNA polymerase II with Gcn4, Gal4 and Ino2/4 targets, as did mutations in SCF(Cdc4) for Gcn4 targets. Expression of a stable phospho-site mutant of Gcn4 (ref. 7) or disruption of the kinases that target Gcn4 for turnover alleviated the sensitivity of Gcn4 activity to defects in the UPS."

Two recent developments have stressed the importance of pol γ. Mutations in the catalytic subunit of human pol γ cause mitochondrial disorders (6Graziewicz M.A. Longley M.J. Bienstock R.J. Zeviani M.

The processivity and substrate binding properties of pol γA are enhanced by complex formation with the accessory subunit (2Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the presence of the accessory subunit has been shown to decrease the fidelity of DNA synthesis by the catalytic subunit because it increases the ability of the enzyme to extend a mismatched primer (10Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Initial characterizations of pol γ suggested that the enzyme forms a heterodimer containing one copy of each subunit. However, when we solved the crystal structure of mouse pol γB, it became apparent that this accessory factor is itself a homodimer with remarkable structural similarity to prokaryotic tRNA synthetases (Protein Data Bank code 1G5H (11Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)). We considered it to be very unlikely that this dimerization is a crystal packing artifact, especially because we were able to show that wild-type pol γB sedimented more rapidly than a deletion derivative lacking a major portion of the dimerization interface (11Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The incorporation of pol γB in the pol γ holoenzyme appears to be a relatively recent event in evolutionary terms. The protein has not been reported in yeast, where pol γ was first cloned as a product of the mip1 gene (12Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20552-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and efforts to find evidence for it have been unsuccessful (13Lucas P. Lasserre J.-P. Plissonneau J. Castroviejo M. Mitochondrion. 2004; 4: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Drosophila pol γ differs from the enzyme in vertebrates as it is reported to contain only one subunit each of pol γA and pol γB (14Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Olson M. Wang Y. Elder R. Kaguni L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28932-28937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), because the amino acids required for dimerization of human pol γB are absent in the Drosophila ortholog. Thus, pol γ provides an interesting example of a eukaryotic DNA polymerase with variable quaternary structure. A number of publications have speculated on the possibility that pol γAor pol γB alone may have roles in mtDNA replication or repair independent of the other subunit (5Johnson A. Tsai Y. Graves S. Johnson K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have undertaken the studies described here to examine the stoichiometry and association kinetics for human pol γB by using a range of different methods. Our studies represent the first extensive investigation of the interaction between subunits of human pol γ and show that the native enzyme is a heterotrimer that contains one molecule of the catalytic subunit and two molecules of the processivity factor. The tight binding we observe between the two subunits suggests that the free subunits do not exist in vivo and that individual subunits do not play important roles in mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. Purification of Proteins—His-tagged recombinant exo- pol γA was purified from Sf9 cells infected with the pVL1393 baculovirus engineered to express exo- pol γA as described by Longley et al. (18Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in suspension culture in JRH Excell 420 culture medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum and 100 IU penicillin plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 5-Liter batches of cells were harvested on the 4th day of infection yielding ∼40 g of cells. Cells were lysed by sonication in 150 ml of Buffer I (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) with 0.3 m KCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysate was centrifuged at 96,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was treated with 0.04% polyethyleneimine and centrifuged for 30 min at 96,000 × g to remove the DNA. The lysate was adjusted to contain 60 mm imidazole and 5 mm MgCl2 and loaded onto Ni-IDA HisTrap resin (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer II (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) with 0.2 m KCl and 50 mm imidazole. After washing with 10 column volumes of Buffer II, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (0.05-1 m) in Buffer II with 0.1 m KCl. Fractions of the eluate containing pol γA were diluted with Buffer I to adjust the conductivity to below 0.1 m KCl. The enzyme was applied to a 1.0-ml HR 5/5 Mono S column equilibrated in Buffer I with 0.08 m KCl. After washing with 5 column volumes, the protein was eluted with a 15-column volume linear gradients of 0.08 to 0.7 m KCl in Buffer I. Fractions containing peak absorbance at 280 nm were loaded onto a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer I containing 0.3 m KCl. The exo- pol γA eluted from this column at 62 ml. All chromatographic steps were performed at 4 °C. The enzyme was concentrated to 1 mg/ml using a 100,000 Mr Vivaspin ultrafiltration device. The yield of the protein was about 0.7 mg/liter culture. The His-tagged recombinant pol γB and pol γBΔI4 mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 RIL codon+ cells (Novagen) transfected with plasmid pET22b+ constructs as described by Carrodeguas et al. (11Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). When proteins were prepared without a His tag, the construct was modified by introducing a stop codon at the NotI restriction site of the pET22b+ vector. Pellets from 2 liters of bacterial culture expressing pol γB were suspended in 40 ml of Buffer I with 0.3 m KCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, and cells were broken in a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was treated with 0.14% polyethyleneimine and centrifuged under the same conditions to remove the DNA. The lysate was adjusted to contain 50 mm imidazole and 5 mm MgCl2, and the protein was purified by nickel affinity, cation exchange, and gel filtration chromatography as described for pol γA above. The enzyme was concentrated to 8 mg/ml using a 30,000 Mr Centricon ultrafiltration device. The yields of pol γB and pol γBΔI4 proteins were about 2 and 8 mg/liter culture, respectively. Reconstituted pol γ holoenzyme was prepared by mixing 1 volume of Sf9 lysate containing His-tagged exo- pol γA and 0.7 volume E. coli lysate containing recombinant pol γB without a His tag. The relative volumes used for this reconstitution varied somewhat from one preparation to another based on the specific protein concentrations of the lysates as assessed by SDS-PAGE. The lysates were mixed for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotator and adjusted to contain 60 mm imidazole and 5 mm MgCl2. The holoenzyme was purified and concentrated using the same protocol as for pol γA. The extinction coefficients used to quantify protein were determined following Gill and von Hippel (19Gill S. von Hippel P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The ϵ280 for pol γA was 243,790 A280/m and that used for both WT pol γB and pol γBΔI4 was 71,940 A280/m, because the deletion did not remove any residues that contribute to A280. The absorbance measurements were routinely made on native protein preparations and were blanked against the dialysate used in preparing the protein. Controls indicated that absorbances at 280 nm were identical within 3% when the proteins were denatured with guanidine hydrochloride. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted using a Beckman XL-I Optima analytical ultracentrifuge and a Ti-60a rotor. Six-channel, charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces with quartz windows were filled with 100 μl of sample (in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) at protein concentrations between 1.88 and 5.64 μm. Absorbance profiles were acquired at 280 nm. Sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed at 4 °C, using three different speeds (15,000, 18,000, and 22,000 rpm for wild-type pol γB and 20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 rpm for pol γBΔI4). The data were analyzed by two programs, Heteroanalysis (National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Facility at the University of Connecticut) and the XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (Beckman), and consistent results were obtained. Solvent density was calculated as 1.026 (Sednterp software (20Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar)), and the partial specific volumes of protein were approximated from their amino acid compositions (0.7299 for wild-type pol γB and 0.7283 for pol γBΔI4) (Sednterp). Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to analyze binding kinetics was performed on a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C. pol γA was immobilized on a Sensor Chip S CM5 using the amine coupling kit (Biacore AB) in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, with immobilization levels of 1400 resonance units (RU). Analytes (WT pol γB and pol γBΔI4) were injected at concentrations ranging from 0 to 320 nm over the sensor chip with immobilized pol γA for 3 min followed by 8 min of dissociation and 10 s of regeneration using 3 mm NaOH, 1 mm KCl. Mass transfer and linked reaction experiments were performed. The kinetics of pol γB and pol γBΔI4 interaction with immobilized pol γA was evaluated using alternative predefined models in the BIAevaluation 4.1 software (Biacore AB). A model was judged appropriate if it fit to every experiment with χ2 <1.5. The conformational change model assumes a two-state reaction, where analyte B binds to ligand A followed by a conformational change of the complex AB to AB*. The overall dissociation constant KD is calculated from the rate constants as follows: KD = 1/(ka1/ka2 × (1 + ka2/kd2)). For stoichiometry determinations, a sensor Chip S CM5 with immobilization levels of pol γA at 600 RU was used. Analytes (pol γB and pol γBΔI4) were injected at increasing concentrations (from 50 to 500 nm) over immobilized pol γA for 5 min followed by 8 min of dissociation and 10 s of regeneration using 3 mm NaOH, 1 mm KCl. When the saturated concentration was achieved, Rmax values for pol γB (420 RU) pol γBΔI4 (217 RU) were measured, and the stoichiometry was calculated based on the equation: Sn = (Mr(pol γA)/Mr(pol γB)) × Rmax/RL, where RL is the resonance signal at a given ligand concentration. The affinity of the enzymes for DNA was investigated using the streptavidin-coated sensor chip (SA chip; Biacore). A solution (2 nm) of a 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide (5′-BioTEG) 26:45-mer (Qiagen) in HBS-EP BIAcore buffer was used to yield an increase of 10 RU (1 min) on flow cell 1 and 150 RU (10 min) on flow cell 2. Two other flow cells without an oligonucleotide were used as reference cells. After immobilization, running buffer with low salt was used (30 mm KCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). To compare the affinity of enzymes for DNA at different salt concentrations, 50 nm analytes (pol γA, pol γAB2, and pol γABΔI4) in buffers with different ionic strengths (30-200 mm for KCl and 1-40 mm for MgCl2) were injected over immobilized oligonucleotide for 8 min followed by 30 s of regeneration using 1 m KCl. In experiments with varied MgCl2 concentration, 30 mm KCl was used. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed with a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal) at 25 °C with a mixing speed of 302 rpm. The WT pol γB (160 μm) or pol γBΔI4 (130 μm) proteins were titrated as 5-μl injections (first injection 2 μl) into the sample cell containing 7.2 μm exo- pol γA. Samples were prepared by dialyzing all interacting components extensively against a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The heats of dilution of both proteins with buffer were determined and subtracted prior to analysis. Data were analyzed using the ORIGIN software supplied with the instrument according to the one- and two-binding sites models. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Native gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were conducted as described (11Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using the 26:45-mer primer-template labeled on the 5′ end of the 45-mer (16Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), except that the assays were conducted as challenge assays to assess the stability of the DNA-protein complexes. Binding reactions were assembled in 30 μl containing 4 nm labeled primer-template, 4 nm pol γA, and where indicated, 8 nm pol γB or pol γBΔI4 (both forms of pol γB calculated as a monomer). Binding reactions continued for 10 min. At this time 4 μl were removed as a binding control, and 3 μl of 200 nm cold 26:45-mer were added as a competitor to bind any protein that dissociated from the labeled complex. A second 4-μl sample was removed within 10 s after the competitor was mixed into the reaction and was considered a 0.2-min time point during the time series. The binding control and 0.2-min sample were loaded directly into the lanes of a running native gel. Additional 4-μl samples were removed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and in some cases 32 min after addition of the competitor. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried onto Whatman DE81 paper and exposed to a PhosphorImager to quantify the radioactivity of bound and free DNA. DNA Polymerase Assays—DNA polymerase assays were performed as described (2Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.2 pmol of pol γA and varied amounts of pol γBor pol γBΔI4 in 30-μl reactions using either 120 μg/ml activated calf thymus DNA or 10 μg/ml poly(dA)-oligo(dT) as template. The standard polymerase reaction buffer was 50 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Where indicated, reactions contained 140 mm KCl. Primer-extension processivity experiments were performed as described by Carrodeguas et al. (2Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the legend of Fig. 9. High Level Expression of Both Subunits of Human pol γ and Reconstitution of the Holoenzyme—We and others have been unable to express pol γA in bacteria in an intact form. To obtain quantities of recombinant enzyme sufficient for biophysical studies, we expressed the protein in insect cells from a baculovirus construct. Although it is possible to express the holoenzyme entirely in insect cells by co-expressing the A and B subunits, we chose to express the B subunit in bacteria using the T7 system. This permits us to test the activity of a number of pol γB variants without making an independent baculovirus construct for each protein of interest. In this study, we compared the binding of wild-type pol γB to a deletion derivative that we refer to as pol γBΔI4. This derivative, which contains a glycine residue in place of residues 147-178 of pol γB, was first reported by Carrodeguas et al. (11Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to test the role of the four-helix bundle observed in the mouse pol γB crystal structure in dimerization of the accessory factor. This derivative has some ability to bind to primer-templates along with pol γA but has little ability to stimulate activity of the catalytic subunit. Thus, we set out to compare the association of wild-type pol γB and pol γBΔI4 to pol γA in this study. Mixing a lysate of insect cells containing His-tagged pol γA with a lysate of bacterial cells expressing nontagged pol γB permits association of the subunits and purification of pol γ holoenzyme by using a three-step procedure. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” this procedure consists of affinity chromatography on a Ni-IDA (His-trap®) resin followed by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. In a typical preparation beginning with 21 g of SF9 cells expressing pol γA and 15 g of BL21 cells expressing pol γB, we obtained a final yield of ∼4.5 mg of pol γ holoenzyme. pol γA is prepared similarly without the addition of pol γB. These procedures have provided a sufficient quantity of enzyme for the biophysical studies of the association of the polymerase subunits reported here. The purity of typical proteins is shown in Fig. 1. It is apparent that the amount of the small subunit bound to pol γA is diminished by approximately half when the reconstitution is performed with pol γBΔI4 rather than with wild-type pol γB. We previously compared the sedimentation properties of pol γB and pol γBΔI4 by using velocity sedimentation in glycerol gradients using a preparative ultracentrifuge (11Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this paper, we characterized these proteins in more detail by using equilibrium ultracentrifugation as shown in Fig. 2. For wild-type pol γB, sedimentation equilibrium distributions were fit to a single species. When the molar mass was treated as the unknown parameter in the global analysis, an average molecular mass of 105,747 Da was obtained (compared with the expected molecular mass of 106,916 Da for dimeric pol γB). Attempts to fit the data to a self-association model failed to yield better results. This is consistent with other data suggesting that the wild-type protein is a tightly bound homodimer with effectively no monomer present under these conditions. We estimated that the pol γB dimer association is characterized by a KD somewhat tighter than 0.1 nm. In contrast, analysis of data for the I4 mutant was complex. When the data were analyzed using a single-component model the apparent molecular mass calculated by the software was 70 kDa, a value intermediate between a monomer and a dimer. Moreover, the residuals indicated that the single-component model was a poor fit to the data (data not shown). A better fit was obtained using a self-association model for a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The fitted monomer molecular mass was 48,370 Da, and the dissociation constant (KD) was 5.8 μm. The fact that pol γBΔI4 retains a weak ability to dimerize is consistent with the inference drawn from the crystal structure of mouse pol γB. In this model, we estimated that domain 2, which is deleted in pol γBΔI4, contributes 2675 Å2 to the total dimerization interface of 6850 Å2. Thus, it is reasonable that pol γBΔI4 retains a weak ability to dimerize at high protein concentrations but behaves as a monomer at protein concentrations significantly below the KD value, as in most in vivo or in vitro reactions involving pol γ. Because the final step in our purification is a high resolution gel filtration step, we applied this as an analytical method to study the stoichiometry of the holoenzyme. Fig. 3 shows the results of a titration in which known molar quantities of pol γA and pol γB, as determined using the calculated extinction coefficients, were applied to a 60-cm Amersham Biosciences Superdex 200 gel filtration column. The elution profiles of free pol γA and pol γB are shown in the background of each panel. All added pol γB was bound to pol γA until saturation was reached at a 1:2 molar ratio of A to B. As the quantity of pol γB was further increased, a peak of excess free pol γB was apparent. This is consistent with the crystallographic finding that pol γB is a dimer. A similar binding titration performed with pol γA and pol γBΔI4 showed saturation at a ratio of 1:1 (data not shown). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Confirms the 1:2 Stoichiometry of A and B Subunits and Estimates the Affinity of the Interaction—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure the enthalpy of holoenzyme formation, stoichiometry of the complex, and the dissociation constant. The ionic strength of the reaction buffer was chosen based on dynamic light scattering data, which demonstrated that aggregation was minimal under these conditions (data not shown). ITC was performed in parallel with both wild-type pol γB and pol γBΔI4 (Fig. 4). KD values for complexes of native pol γB and pol γBΔI4 subunits with pol γA (Table 1) were similar and within experimental error. A 2-fold difference in stoichiometry of the complexes formed by WT pol γB or the pol γBΔI4 mutant in binding to pol γA was observed, which is a logical consequence of the proposed monomeric nature of the I4 mutant. These results, along with our size exclusion chromatography data (Fig. 3), confirm that the stoichiometry of the complex between pol γA and WT pol γB is 1:2. Interaction of pol γA with the pol γB dimer is characterized as an exothermic process with ΔH of -6.4 kcal/mol and a KD of ∼0.15 μm. Association of pol γA with the monomeric pol γBΔI4 mutant protein is nearly as tight as it is with the wild-type protein. Because this experiment was performed under stoichiometric binding conditions, i.e. with a pol γA concentration (7 μm) in excess of the KD value, we considered that this experiment overestimates the KD for the interaction between the subunits.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for pol γB and or pol γBΔI4 binding to exo- pol γANaN indicates stoichiometry of bindingKDΔG0bΔG0 estimated from titration curve using MicroCal software (experiments were performed at 25 °C)ΔH0–TΔS0μmcal/molWT pol γB1.97 (0.011)cThe errors shown in parentheses are the means ± S.D.0.15 (0.014)–9305–6373 (52.5)–2932polγBΔI41.06 (0.062)cThe errors shown in parentheses are the means ± S.D.0.14 (0.014)–9344–8522 (75.0)–822a N indicates stoichiometry of bindingb ΔG0 estimated from titration curve using MicroCal software (experiments were performed at 25 °C)c The errors shown in parentheses are the means ± S.D. Open table in a new tab Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of the pol γA-pol γB Interaction—SPR analysis was employed to study the interaction of pol γA with either pol γB or pol γBΔI4 in real time. pol γA was injected onto the activated sensor chip surface to immobilize the protein to the carboxymethyl-activated dextran to the extent of 1400 resonance units (RU), corresponding to ∼1.4 ng/mm2 of covalently linked protein. According to mass transfer tests, the influence of diffusion on binding of pol γB to pol γA was negligible in our experimental conditions. Baseline drifts because of covalent linkage ruptures between the immobilized pol γA and the dextran matrix were also minimal for at least 10 consecutive ligand injections. Typical association and dissociation curves characterizing the interaction of pol γB with pol γA are shown in Fig. 5A. Association and dissociation rate constants were obtained using curve fitting as implemented in the BIAevaluation software version 3.0. Because standard Langmuir kinetics modeling resulted in a poor fit (χ2 >20), a two-state reaction model was used, which led to considerably better results. Kinetic and equilibrium constants obtained as well as fitting details are summarized in Table 2. Similar experiments with the I4 mutant, which is unable to form a dimer at these low protein concentrations, demonstrated similar association and dissociation kinetics (Fig. 5B). The overall dissociation constant for the wild-type protein is 27 nm. The association between pol γBΔI4 and pol γA is weaker by approximately a factor of 2. These measurements are comparable with the apparent KD of 35 nm for the pol γB-pol γA interaction estimated from polymerase stimulation kineti"

We report here that receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase-κ (RPTP-κ) dephosphorylates EGFR and thereby regulates its function in human keratinocytes. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in intact primary human keratinocytes and cell-free membrane preparations. Five highly expressed RPTPs (RPTP-β, δ, κ, μ, and ξ) were functionally analyzed in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-based expression system. Full-length human EGFR expressed in CHO cells, which lack endogenous EGFR, displayed high basal (i.e. in the absence of ligand) tyrosine phosphorylation. Co-expression of RPTP-κ, but not other RPTPs, specifically reduced basal EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. RPTP-κ also reduced epidermal growth factor-dependent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO cells. Purified RPTP-κ preferentially dephosphorylated EGFR tyrosines 1068 and 1173 in vitro. Overexpression of wild-type or catalytically inactive RPTP-κ reduced or enhanced, respectively, basal and EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in human keratinocytes. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RPTP-κ increased basal and EGF-stimulated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and augmented downstream Erk activation in human keratinocytes. RPTP-κ levels increased in keratinocytes as cells reached confluency, and overexpression of RPTP-κ in subconfluent keratinocytes reduced keratinocyte proliferation. Taken together, the above data indicate that RPTP-κ is a key regulator of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and function in human keratinocytes.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification that modulates a variety of protein functions, including protein stability, protein-protein interaction, enzymatic activity, etc. Regulated reversible protein phosphorylation plays key roles in signal transduction pathways controlling many fundamental cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, motility, metabolism, cytoskeletal organization, development, and cell-cell interactions (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar, 2Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by two classes of counteracting enzymes, namely protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs 2The abbreviations used are: PTKprotein-tyrosine kinasePTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseEGFepidermal growth factorEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorRPTP-κreceptor type protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-κRPTKreceptor protein tyrosine-kinaseRPTPreceptor type PTPsCHOChinese hamster ovaryTGF-βtransforming growth factor-βGSTglutathione S-transferase., EC 2.7.1.112) and protein-tyrosine-phosphatases (PTPs, EC 3.1.3.48). The number of genes in the human genome that encode active PTPs and active PTKs has recently been estimated to be very similar (3Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottin N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A.

Del Vecchio R. Tonks N. Moller N. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence indicates that, depending on the particular pathway, protein tyrosine dephosphorylation can be of equal or greater importance than protein tyrosine phosphorylation for the regulation of cellular function (5Fischer E. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). protein-tyrosine kinase protein-tyrosine phosphatase epidermal growth factor epidermal growth factor receptor receptor type protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-κ receptor protein tyrosine-kinase receptor type PTPs Chinese hamster ovary transforming growth factor-β glutathione S-transferase. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB1) belongs to the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK) superfamily. It is composed of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain possessing PTK activity. Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR stabilizes homodimerization and heterodimerization with other ErbB members, which promotes trans tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular C-terminal domain. EGFR activation is synonymous with increased phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within its intracellular C-terminal domain. These phosphorylated tyrosines function as docking sites for a variety of signaling molecules that regulate membrane-proximal steps of signal transduction cascades that ultimately bring about cellular responses to EGFR ligands (6Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that EGFR not only participates in cognate ligand-induced signal transduction pathways but also plays important roles in diverse signal transduction pathways initiated by G protein-coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, integrins, ion channels, and stress responses (7Prenzel N. Fischer O. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocrine-Related Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 8Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Aberrant regulation of EGFR has been shown to promote multiple tumorigenic processes by stimulating proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis (10Huang S. Harai P. Invest New Drugs. 1999; 17: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). EGFR and/or its ligands have a critical role in most common human epithelial cancers and many different types of solid tumors (11Salomon D. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar). The central role of EGFR in diverse signal transduction pathways dictates that its tyrosine phosphorylation must be strictly regulated. One potential mechanism for such regulation is through PTP-catalyzed dephosphorylation. The subfamily of “classical,” strictly tyrosine-specific PTPs contains 38 members, 21 of which are transmembrane receptor types and 17 of which are intracellular, non-receptor types (4Andersen J. Jansen P. Echwald S. Mortensen O. Fukada T. Del Vecchio R. Tonks N. Moller N. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). All classical PTPs contain a signature motif (HVCXXXXXR(S/T)) within a catalytic domain of 250 amino acid residues (12Walton K. Dixon J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The cysteine residue in the PTP signature motif is absolutely required for catalytic activity (13Guan K. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor-type PTPs (RPTPs) are integral membrane proteins composed of extracellular adhesion molecule-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain containing one or two catalytic domains. Reduced phosphorylation of EGFR has been associated with several different PTP activities (14Flint A. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 15Tiganis T. Bennett A. Ravichandran K. Tonks N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tenev T.

Using an expression strategy in EGFR-lacking Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, we have identified RPTP-κ as a specific EGFR PTP. We have further demonstrated that RPTP-κ regulates both basal and ligand-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and function. Materials—Adult human primary keratinocytes were obtained from Cascade Biologics Inc. (Portland, OR). CHO cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). EGFR, Erk, and RPTP-β antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PD169540 was generously provided by Dr. David Fry from Pfizer (Ann Arbor, MI). Phospho-EGFR (pY-1068 and pY-992) and phospho-Erk antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Phospho-EGFR (pY-1173) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY). RPTP-μ antibody was purchased from Exalpha Biologicals, Inc. (Watertown, MA). Cell Culture—Adult human primary keratinocytes were expanded in modified MCDB153 medium (EpiLife, Cascade Biologics, Inc.). CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium with 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Preparation of Keratinocyte Membranes and EGFR Activation Assay— Human keratinocytes were washed twice with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 with 10 mm NaCl) supplemented with 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Membranes were extracted with 0.5 m NaCl to remove loosely associated proteins. Membrane suspension was then supplemented with 100 μm ATP, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol and 30 mm MgCl2. Incubation with EGF or phosphatase inhibitors was performed at room temperature. SDS sample buffer was added to stop the reactions. EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot using phospho-EGFR (pY-1068) antibody. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates—Human primary keratinocytes or CHO cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the culture plates in WCE buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) supplemented with 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Following 10 min of incubation at 4 °C, cell homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were collected and used as whole cell lysates. Protein Phosphatase Assay—Phosphatase assay buffer (100 μl) containing 5 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 100 g/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA was mixed with cell membrane extracts (50 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 96-well microtiter plates. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 13% K2HPO4 (15 μl). Hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was measured spectrophotometrically (405 nm) using a microtiter plate reader (Titertek Multiskan MCC/340, EFLAB, Finland). Generation of RPTP-κ Polyclonal Antibody—A peptide with a unique sequence derived from the intracellular domain (RGHNESKADCLD-MDP KAPQH) with predicted high probability of surface exposure and high antigenic index was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into New Zealand White rabbits (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX). After two booster injections, anti-RPTP-κ antibody was affinity-purified from hyperimmune serum. The antibody was tested for its performance in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation. In Vitro Dephosphorylation of Purified EGFR—Purified full-length EGFR was purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). EGFR was tyrosine-phosphorylated according to the manufacturer's protocol and used as substrate for the RPTP-κ intracellular region GST fusion protein. Dephosphorylation reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample loading buffer, and the level of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was measured by Western analysis probed with phospho-EGFR antibody. Western Analysis Detection and Quantitation—Western blots were developed and quantified using an enhanced chemifluorescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive fluorescent protein bands were detected by the STORM phosphor-imaging device using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Sample loads, antibody concentration, and incubation times were adjusted to yield fluorescent signals within the linear range of detection. Transient Transfection of CHO Cells—Mammalian expression vectors for EGFR (pRK5 EGFR) and RPTP (pShuttle RPTP) coding sequences were transiently transfected into CHO cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Expression of EGFR and RPTP mRNA and protein was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (7700 Taqman Sequence Detector, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and Western analysis, respectively, 24 h after transfection. Association of EGFR with Wild-type and Trapping Mutant RPTP-κ— Full-length EGFR and His6-tagged full-length wild-type or trapping mutant (D1051A) RPTP-κ were co-transfected into CHO cells. One day after transfection, the cells were treated with 50 ng/ml EGF for 10 min at 37 °C and subsequently lysed in TGH buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100), and RPTP-κ protein complexes were purified using Dynabeads TALON (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) and analyzed by Western blot. Adeno-X Expression Vector Construction and Adenovirus Production— Wild-type and catalytically inactive (2C/S) human RPTP-κ expression vectors were generated using the Adeno-X expression system (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). To facilitate detection of expressed RPTP-κ, a polyhistidine (His6) tag was inserted into the C terminus of RPTP-κ. HEK293 cells were used for adenovirus production and purification. Generation of RPTP-κ-GST Fusion Protein—cDNA encoding the intracellular region of human RPTP-κ (RPTP-κ-IC, corresponding to residues 754–1414) was cloned into the XhoI (5′) and NotI (3′) site of GST fusion protein expression vector pGEX-6P-3. GST-RPTP-κ-IC fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified by GST affinity column according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Purity was at least 90%, as judged by SDS-PAGE. siRNA Silencing of RPTP-κ in Primary Human Keratinocytes—A unique 21-mer RNA sequence derived from RPTP-κ coding sequence (5′-AAG GTT TGC CGC TTC CTT CAG-3′) was designed using Oligoengine software (Seattle, WA). Control siRNA contained a random sequence without homology to any known human gene. Double-stranded siRNA was synthesized by Xeragon Inc, (Valencia, CA). The synthetic siRNA was transfected into primary human keratinocytes using Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofactor (Cologne, Germany). Expression of RPTP-κ in primary keratinocytes increased with cell confluency (see Fig. 10A). To achieve the maximal knockdown effect, siRNA-transfected keratinocytes were cultured to confluency for analysis. Inhibition of Protein-Tyrosine-Phosphatase Activity Is Associated with Increased EGFR Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Primary Human Keratinocytes—Treatment of intact primary adult human keratinocytes with two nonspecific PTP inhibitors, H2O2 and pervanadate, caused substantial and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 1A). The magnitude of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was similar to that induced by EGF (20 ng/ml) (Fig. 1A). For these, an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine 1068 in EGFR was used. This approach allowed us to detect phosphorylated EGFR in lysates without the need for immunoprecipitation prior to Western blotting. The finding that PTP inhibitors cause accumulation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation suggests the potential importance of PTP activity in the regulation of EGFR function. This potential importance was further investigated in cell-free, EGFR-enriched membrane fractions from human keratinocytes. Treatment of membranes in the presence of Mg2+/ATP with PTP inhibitors hydrogen peroxide, pervanadate, or orthovanadate significantly induced phosphorylation of EGFR tyrosine residue 1068 (Fig. 1B). The magnitude of tyrosine 1068 phosphorylation following treatment with either PTP inhibitor was 3–5-fold greater than treatment of membranes with EGF (20 ng/ml). As expected, treatment of keratinocyte membranes with hydrogen peroxide, pervanadate, or orthovanadate (but not EGF) inhibited endogenous membrane-associated PTP activity (Fig. 1C). These data suggest the possible involvement of an integral membrane RPTP activity in the regulation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Profile of RPTPs in EGFR-expressing Human Keratinocytes—To investigate the above possibility, we first assessed which of 21 known RPTPs in the human genome are expressed in human keratinocytes. Specific PCR primers for each of the 21 human RPTPs were designed and tested for specificity using cloned cDNAs as templates. Each of the 21 PCR products generated from cloned templates was authenticated by DNA sequencing. RT-PCR was used to detect mRNA expression of each of the 21 RPTPs in adult human keratinocytes and adult human skin. RT-PCR reactions for 13 RPTPs yielded products of the expected size (data not shown). Each product was cloned and verified by DNA sequencing. RPTPs β, δ, κ, μ, and ζ were predominantly expressed and therefore chosen for further study. Dephosphorylation of EGFR by RPTP-κ Transiently Expressed in CHO Cells—To determine whether any of the five candidate RPTPs is able to regulate EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, we employed a transient transfection system using CHO cells, which do not express EGFR. Transient transfection of CHO cells with EGFR expression vector alone resulted in a high level of basal (i.e. in the absence of ligand) EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Treatment of EGFR-expressing CHO cells with EGF modestly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 2A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in CHO cells was completely blocked by treatment of cells with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD169540, demonstrating that tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in CHO cells was due to intrinsic EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (data not shown). To examine the ability of the RPTPs to dephosphorylate EGFR, cDNAs encoding human RPTP-β,-δ,-κ,-μ, and -ζ were co-expressed with EGFR in CHO cells. To verify that each RPTP was expressed, we determined their mRNA levels using real-time RT-PCR. In vector control-transfected CHO cells, no mRNA for any of the five RPTPs was detectable. In RPTP-transfected CHO cells, the mRNA level of each of the five RPTPs was readily detectable and similar (Fig. 2B). We also determined that transfection resulted in detectable RPTP-β,-κ, and -μ protein expression (we could not obtain useful antibodies for RPTP-δ and -ζ) (Fig. 2C). Importantly, only RPTP-κ (but not RPTP-β,-δ,-κ,-μ, and -ζ) was able to significantly reduce constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in CHO cells (Fig. 3A). In addition to the reduction of constitutive EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, expression of RPTP-κ reduced EGF-stimulated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that RPTP-κ is capable of reducing EGFR intrinsic tyrosine kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation when co-expressed in CHO cells. RPTP-κ Directly Dephosphorylates EGFR in Vitro—To determine whether RPTP-κ can directly dephosphorylate EGFR, we constructed, expressed, and purified catalytically active human RPTP-κ intracellular region GST fusion protein (GST-RPTP-κ-IC). GST-RPTP-κ-IC was incubated with autophosphorylated purified full-length human EGFR, and the rate of tyrosine dephosphorylation was monitored by Western analysis using antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine residues 1068, 992, and 1173. RPTP-κ rapidly dephosphorylated EGFR tyrosine 1068 and 1173 (Fig. 4). EGFR tyrosine 992 was dephosphorylated at a substantially slower rate than tyrosine 1068 (Fig. 4). In subsequent experiments, tyrosine phosphorylation at residue 1068 was chosen to monitor EGFR dephosphorylation by RPTP-κ. Association of Substrate-trapping Mutant RPTP-κ and EGFR in Intact Cells—To further investigate dephosphorylation of EGFR by RPTP-κ, we performed substrate-trapping studies. Mutation of an aspartic acid (Asp-1051 for RPTP-κ), which is conserved in the active site of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, to alanine prevents completion of phosphate ester hydrolysis and therefore causes the formation of a stable enzyme-substrate complex (14Flint A. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). We co-expressed full-length human EGFR with His-tagged full-length wild-type or D1051A mutant RPTP-κ in CHO cells. Following expression, RPTP-κ was captured on nickel-coated beads and analyzed for its association with EGFR by Western analysis. Although wild-type RPTP-κ catalyzes the dephosphorylation of EGFR in vitro (Fig. 4), it does not appear to form a stable complex with EGFR, as expected, when co-expressed in cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, D1051A RPTP-κ does form a stable complex with EGFR, which can be readily detected by Western analysis (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that EGFR is a substrate for RPTP-κ in intact cells. Dephosphorylation of Endogenous EGFR by RPTP-κ in Primary Human Keratinocytes—We next examined the effect of RPTP-κ on tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous EGFR in primary human keratinocytes. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of RPTP-κ in primary human keratinocytes significantly reduced EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine 1068 phosphorylation (Fig. 6). Expression of catalytically inactive 2C/S-RPTP-κ, with cysteine to serine mutation in both PTP catalytic domains, increased both basal and EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine 1068 phosphorylation (Fig. 6). This increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation likely reflects dominant negative activity of catalytically inactive 2C/S-RPTP-κ (12Walton K. Dixon J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 13Guan K. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation observed with expression of RPTP-κ was specific, because adenovirus-mediated overexpression of RPTP-μ, which is most structurally related to RPTP-κ, did not reduce EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in human keratinocytes (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Co-expression of RPTP-μ with EGFR does not alter EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in human keratinocytes.

The RPTP-κ protein level was reduced by 70% (Fig. 8B). Reduction of endogenous RPTP-κ by siRNA increased EGFR basal tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9A). In addition, reduction of endogenous RPTP-κ by siRNA significantly potentiated EGF-stimulated EGFR tyrosine 1068 phosphorylation (Fig. 9B).FIGURE 9siRNA-mediated knockdown of RPTP-κ increases basal and potentiates EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and Erk activation in human keratinocytes.

Because reduction of endogenous RPTP-κ potentiates basal and EGF-induced EGFR activation, we investigated the effect of RPTP-κ knockdown on Erk activation. siRNA-mediated RPTP-κ knockdown resulted in a 2-fold increase of basal phosphorylation of p44 and p42 Erk, in primary human keratinocytes (Fig. 9C). Similarly, RPTP-κ knockdown resulted in a further 2-fold increase of EGF-induced phosphorylation of Erk (Fig. 9C). RPTP-κ Inhibits Keratinocyte Growth—In culture, growth of human keratinocytes slows and eventually stops as the cells reach confluency. Because keratinocyte growth is EGFR-dependent (19Piepkorn M. Lo C. Plowman G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Hashimoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Dermatol. 1992; 19: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we examined RPTP-κ expression as a function of culture confluency. We found that RPTP-κ mRNA expression was relatively low in subconfluent keratinocytes and increased markedly when keratinocytes became confluent (Fig. 10A). These data indicate that increased expression of RPTP-κ is associated with reduced keratinocyte growth. To examine whether the level of RPTP-κ can influence keratinocyte growth, RPTP-κ was overexpressed in subconfluent keratinocyte cultures with low endogenous RPTP-κ and the rate of proliferation determined. Both empty and RPTP-κ adenovirus-treated keratinocytes displayed slow growth during the first two days after treatment, which is typical for human keratinocyte seeded at low density. Empty adenovirus-treated keratinocytes exhibited accelerated growth during days three and four post-treatment, reaching 80–90% confluency at day four (Fig. 10B). In contrast, RPTP-κ adenovirus-treated keratinocytes showed no significant proliferation during days three and four post-treatment (Fig. 10B). During the course of the experiment, keratinocyte viability, determined by trypan blue exclusion, was >95% for both empty and RPTP-κ adenovirus-treated keratinocytes. We demonstrated that RPTP-κ directly dephosphorylates EGFR in vitro and increased RPTP-κ expression reduces basal and ligand-stimulated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas reduced RPTP-κ expression increases EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Regulation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation is complex and occurs at multiple levels, including ligand activation, internalization, recycling, biosynthesis, and dephosphorylation (21Wiley H. Herbst J. Walsh B. Lauffenburger D. Rosenfeld M. Gill G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Several different PTPs have been demonstrated to reduce EGFR phosphorylation at various stages following ligand activation (14Flint A. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4069-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, however, RPTP-κ is unique among RPTPs in its ability to regulate both basal (i.e. in the absence of exogenous ligand) and ligand-activated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, RPTP-κ is unique in its ability to regulate downstream EGFR function, including Erk activation and cellular proliferation. Human keratinocytes were found to express 13 of 21 known RPTPs. We tested the five most abundantly expressed RPTPs for their ability to reduce basal EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Among the five RPTPs tested, only RPTP-κ was able to significantly reduce basal EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. It is possible that other RPTPs, which we did not study, act in concert with RPTP-κ to reduce EGFR phosphorylation. We found that RPTP-κ preferentially dephosphorylated tyrosines 1068 and 1173, compared with tyrosine 992. This observation further supports the concept that EGFR is acted upon by multiple RPTPs. In this regard, both RPTP LAR, and RPTP-σ have been shown to reduce EGFR phosphorylation (18Pestana E. Tenev T. Gross S. Stoyanov B. Ogata M. Böhmer F.-D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4069-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Kulas D. Goldstein B. Mooney R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 748-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, whether either RPTP acts directly on EGFR, or which phosphotyrosine residue(s) either RPTP affects remains to be determined. Human keratinocytes, similar to many other cell types in culture, cease proliferation in response to cell-cell contacts. Although the detailed mechanism of contact inhibition remains elusive, interactions among adhesion molecules on the surface of adjoining cells plays a pivotal role. The extracellular domains of many RPTPs contain adhesion molecule-like sequences, leading to the proposal that RPTP functions may be regulated, at least in part, by cell-cell contacts (24Östman A. Yang Q. Tonks N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In fact, RPTP-κ and RPTP-μ have been shown to possess adhesion properties that can mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix communication (25Brady-Kalnay S. Flint A. Tonks N. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Gebbink M. Zondag G. Wubbolts R. Beijersbergen R. van Etten I. Moolenaar W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, membrane-associated PTP activity is increased up to 10-fold in contacted-inhibited cells and harvested at high density, compared with proliferating cells at low density, whereas tumor cells, which are not subjected to contact-inhibition, do not show density-dependent increase in membrane-associated PTP activity (27Pallen C. Tong P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6996-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Gaits F. Li R. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RPTP-μ, RPTP-β, and DEP-1 have been shown to be up-regulated as a function of increased cell density in culture (24Östman A. Yang Q. Tonks N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 28Gaits F. Li R. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J. Chap H. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated that RPTP-κ levels also increase as a function of confluence in cultured human keratinocytes. This finding is consistent with the reported increased expression of RPTP-κ with increased confluence in SK-BR-3 human mammary carcinoma cells (30Fuchs M. Müller T. Lerch M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16712-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In human keratinocytes, overexpression or reduced expression of RPTP-κ decreased or elevated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, respectively. These changes in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation were mirrored by alterations in the level of Erk activation. Thus, RPTP-κ appears to regulate a key downstream EGFR effector through regulation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Erk is a critical mediator of keratinocyte proliferation and survival (31Kansra S. Stoll S. Johnson J. Elder J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4299-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of increased RPTP-κ levels to reduce Erk activation is expected to reduce keratinocyte growth. Indeed, we found that raising the level of RPTP-κ in subconfluent keratinocytes resulted in near complete inhibition of growth. Under these conditions, increased expression of RPTP-κ did not alter the level of EGFR. These data suggest that the ratio of RPTP-κ to EGFR, rather than the absolute level of either RPTP-κ or EGFR, is an important determinant of EGFR functionality. A number of epithelial tumors are characterized by hyperactivation of EGFR. Hyperactivation can result from EGFR mutation or overexpression. However, our data suggest that reduced expression of RPTP-κ also allows hyperactivation of EGFR in the absence of any alteration of EGFR itself. Whether reduced expression of RPTP-κ occurs in any human epithelial cancers is currently under investigation. RPTP LAR and RPTP DEP-1 have been shown to regulate insulin receptor and hepatocyte growth factor receptor signaling, respectively (32Mooney R. Kulas D. Bleyle L. Novak J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Palka H. Park M. Tonks N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). DEP-1 has also been reported to be involved in dephosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor in a site-specific manner (34Kovalenko M. Denner K. Sandström J. Persson C. Gross S. Jandt E. Vilella R. Böhmer F.-D. Östman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16219-16226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Given that RPTP-κ dephosphorylates EGFR, raises the possibility that regulation of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) by RPTPs may be a widespread mechanism of control. If so, further elucidation of which RPTPs act on which RPTKs may lead to important new insights into RPTP function and RPTK regulation. The possibility that a single RPTP may regulate more than one RPTK provides the possibility for a novel mechanism of cross-talk among seemingly distinct receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Whether or not RPTP-κ dephosphorylates other RPTKs in addition to EGFR must await further investigation. An additional mechanism by which RPTP-κ participates in cross-talk between distinct receptor-mediated signaling pathways has recently been described (35Wang S. Wu F. Shin I. Qu S. Arteaga C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4703-4715Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor complex possesses intrinsic serine threonine kinase activity, which phosphorylates and thereby activates transcription factors Smad2/3. Smad2/3 mediate many cellular responses to TGF-β (36Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). TGF-β is a powerful inhibitor of epithelial cell growth and has previously been reported to induce RPTP-κ in association with growth inhibition in the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line (37Yang Y. Gil M. Byun S. Choi I. Pyun K. Ha H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, TGF-β induction of RPTP-κ has been demonstrated to reduce ligand activation of EGFR and participate in TGF-β-dependent growth reduction in breast cancer cell lines (35Wang S. Wu F. Shin I. Qu S. Arteaga C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4703-4715Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, RPTP-κ emerges as a critical regulator of epithelial cell growth by setting the balance between the proliferative EGFR and anti-proliferative TGF-β pathways. Of note is that TGF-β responsiveness is lost in many epithelial cancers (38Bachman K. Park B. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2005; 1: 49-54Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 39Muraoka-Cook R. Dumont N. Arteaga C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 937s-943sPubMed Google Scholar). This loss may reduce tonic growth inhibition exerted by TGF-β-induced RPTP-κ on EGFR-mediated growth and thereby shift the balance toward more rapid growth in transformed cells. It will be of interest to determine RPTP-κ levels in epithelial tumors, which have lost TGF-β responsiveness.

Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a cell wall lipoglycan. LAMs have been considered modulins because of their capacity to manipulate the host immune system. To date, three families of LAMs have been described (14Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).

The mannose-capped LAMs (Man-LAMs) are found in pathogenic species including M. tuberculosis (14Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositol-capped LAMs have been isolated from non-pathogenic species such as Mycobacterium smegmatis. Phosphoinositol-capped LAMs activate macrophages in a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-dependent manner by activating NF-κB-dependent pathways (21Means T.K. Liews E. Yoshimura A. Wang S. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mycobacterial Man-LAMs on the other hand, modulate the immune response by dampening IL-12 production in macrophages and dendritic cells (22Knutson K. Hmama Z. Herrera-Velit P. Rochford R. Reiner N.E.

Dis. 2000; 182: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The emerging consensus is that Man-LAM contributes to the capacity of M. tuberculosis to survive inside macrophages by mediating immunosuppressive effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that lipomannans induce IL-12 production (26Dao D.N. Kremer L. Guerardel Y. Molano A. Jacobs Jr., H.R. Porcelli S.A. Briken V. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2067-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) in a TLR-dependent manner and may also inhibit IL-12 production in a TLR-independent manner (27Quesniaux V.J. Nicolle D.M.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 4425-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ratio of lipomannans to Man-LAM may govern the capacity of the organism to circumvent IL-12 production. The anti-inflammatory effects of Man-LAM have been attributed to their binding to the mannose receptor (23Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) or to DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing nonintegrin (28Geijtenbeek T.B. Van Vliet J. Koppel E.A.

Stimulation through TLRs by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as LPS triggers production of various cytokines, including IL-12, which is crucial for induction of Th1 responses (10Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar, 31Moser M. Murphy K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The resultant inflammatory response is essential for the eradication of infectious microorganisms. However, excessive and prolonged activation of innate immunity is harmful to the host. To prevent such an undesirable outcome, the innate immune system has dampening mechanisms to prevent continued inflammatory signaling in response to repeated challenge by pathogenic stimuli. Dampening of the proinflammatory response may occur by multiple processes, which often lead to limited activation of NF-κB. Four different IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) have been identified. IRAK-M is devoid of kinase activity and is restricted to monocytes/macrophages. It negatively regulates TLR signaling (32Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A.

Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 is another inducible negative regulator of TLR signaling, although its induction occurs only through TLR4 (34Kinjyo I. Hanada T. Inagaki-Ohara K. Mori H. Aki D.

Additional safety systems to control the magnitude of NF-κB activation involve phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which negatively regulates TLR signaling and likely functions at the early stages of encounter to pathogens (36Fukao T.

In this study, we have demonstrated that Man-LAM from M. tuberculosis suppresses LPS-induced IL-12 p40 protein production, mRNA expression, and promoter activity in murine RAW264.7 macrophages by inhibiting LPS-induced IRAK-TRAF6 interaction, IκB-α phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of c-Rel and p50. Silencing of Irak-M by RNA interference supports our view that Man-LAM dampens IL-12 p40 production through an IRAK-M-mediated pathway. Whereas the inhibitory effect of Man-LAM on IL-12 production is widely acknowledged, the mechanism has remained obscure. Our studies provide mechanistic insight into how a mycobacterial modulin functions to dampen TLR signaling. Reagents—Anti-IRAK-M, anti-β-actin, anti-FLAG antibody, anti-FLAG-agarose, cycloheximide, and Escherichia coli LPS were from Sigma. Anti-TRAF6 and anti-IRAK1 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-phospho-IκB-α antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA. Cell Culture—The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from the National Center for Cell Science, Pune, India, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine and antibiotics. Mycobacterial Lipids—Endotoxin free Man-LAM from M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and phosphoinositol-capped LAM were kindly provided by Dr. John Belisle, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO. Lipids were dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in pyrogen-free water and diluted with medium before each experiment. Plasmid Constructs—4× NF-κB-luc containing four NF-κB sites in tandem fused to the luciferase reporter gene, was a gift from Dr. A. Brent Carter of the University of Iowa. Murine IL-12 p40 promoter (–350 to +55) was a gift from Prof. Stephen Smale, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 100 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using the Titanium One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Clontech). 363 bp of Irak-M mRNA and 417 bp of IL-12 p40 mRNA were amplified by using the primer pairs 5′-TCTTCAGGTGTCCTTCTCCACTGT-3′(sense) and 5′-CCTCTTCTCCATTGGCTTGCTCCCAT-3′(antisense) for Irak-M, and 5′-GGAGACCCTGCCCATTGAACT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAACGTTGCATCCTAGGATCG-3′ (antisense) for IL-12 p40. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) was amplified using the primers 5′-CCATCAATGACCCCTTCATTGACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAGGCCATGCCAGTGAGCTTCC-3′ (antisense) to generate a 604-bp product. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in TBS-Tween 20 (1%, v/v) (TBST) with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Following three washes of 5 min each with TBST, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:1,000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes with TBST, the blots were developed by chemiluminescence using the phototope-horseradish peroxidase Western Detection Kit (Cell Signaling Technology) and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-AR5). Luciferase Reporter Assays—RAW264.7 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid constructs using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells after treatment were lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, centrifuged, and the supernatant assayed for luciferase activity. Results were normalized for transfection efficiencies by assay of β-galactosidase activity. Enzyme-linked Immunoassay for IL-12 p40—6 × 104 RAW264.7 cells (plated in each well of a 96-well plate) were either left untreated or treated with Man-LAM for 16 h. Man-LAM was then removed and cells were incubated in fresh medium without or with LPS for a further 24 h. The conditioned medium was removed and assayed for IL-12 p40 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the murine IL-12 p40 assay kit (BD Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation of TRAF6 and IRAK1—RAW264.7 cells transfected with FLAG-TRAF6 were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 280 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Pefabloc, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g in a Microfuge and incubated with 2 μg of anti-FLAG-agarose overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Immunoprecipitates were washed, denatured in SDS gel denaturing buffer, proteins were separated electrophoretically, transferred on to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-IRAK1 antibody. Western Blotting for Phospho-IκB-α—RAW264.7 cells after treatment were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 12 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Pefabloc, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates after clarification were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred on to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotted with phospho-IκB-α-specific antibody. When required, blots were reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody to confirm equal loading in all lanes. Generation and Transfection of Small Interfering RNA Constructs for Irak-M—A vector-based system was used to knock down Irak-M by RNA interference using the pSuppressor Neo vector (Imgenex Corporation). The target sequences for murine Irak-M were 5′-TGTCCCAAGTATTCCAGTA-3′ (S1) and 5′-GTCCTACTGTGATCAGTTT-3′ (S2). Cloning was carried out between the SalI and XbaI sites of the vector. All constructs were verified by sequencing. RNA interference expression vectors or control vector (containing a scrambled sequence from Imgenex that did not show significant sequence homology to rat, mouse or human gene sequences) were transfected into RAW264.7 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). NF-κB Assay—Nuclear extracts from cells were prepared using the TransFactor extraction kit (Clontech). After centrifugation for 5 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, supernatants were assayed for the presence of c-Rel and p50. An equal amount of nuclear lysate was added to incubation wells precoated with the DNA-binding consensus sequence. The presence of translocated NF-κB c-Rel or p50 subunit was then assessed by using the Mercury TransFactor kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plates were read at 655 nm. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance between groups was evaluated by Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at the level of p < 0.05. Man-LAM Inhibits LPS-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA Expression and Protein Release in RAW 264.7 Cells—To determine whether Man-LAM affects IL-12 p40 expression and release in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, cells were pretreated with Man-LAM, followed by challenge with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 4 (for mRNA expression) or 24 h (for IL-12 release). Pretreatment of cells with Man-LAM inhibited LPS-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA induction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A) as assessed by RT-PCR. Pretreatment of cells with Man-LAM also resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-12 p40 release (Fig. 1C), in harmony with previous reports (23Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositol-capped LAM did not inhibit either LPS-induced IL-12 protein release or IL-12 p40 mRNA expression (data not shown). The effect of Man-LAM on LPS-induced IL-12 release could be abrogated when cells were pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide followed by treatment with Man-LAM (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of Man-LAM was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Inhibition of LPS-induced IL-12 p40 Induction by Man-LAM Is Independent of IL-10—IL-10 is a potent inhibitor of IL-12 gene expression and protein production (38Aste-Amezaga M. Ma X. Sartori A. Trinchieri G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5936-5944PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether the inhibitory effect of Man-LAM on IL-12 p40 production was because of IL-10-dependent effects, induction of IL-10 mRNA was analyzed. As a positive control, IL-10 mRNA expression was observed by RT-PCR in RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS at concentrations of 5 and 10 μg/ml (Fig. 1B), in accordance with the observations of Brightbill et al. (39Brightbill H.D. Plevy S.E. Modlin R.L. Smale S.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1940-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, Man-LAM (at concentrations up to 10 μg/ml) did not induce IL-10 release in RAW264.7 macrophages in agreement with previous reports (40Dahl K.E. Shiratsuchi H. Hamilton B.D. Ellner J.J. Toossi Z. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 399-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, when RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with Man-LAM in the presence of neutralizing antibody to IL-10, no effect was observed on the ability of Man-LAM to suppress LPS-induced IL-10 production (Fig. 1D). We therefore concluded that down-regulation of LPS-induced IL-12 production by Man-LAM is not dependent on IL-10-mediated effects. Man-LAM Inhibits LPS-induced IL-12 p40 Promoter Activity—To analyze the molecular mechanisms of inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene expression by Man-LAM, the ability of Man-LAM to modulate LPS-induced IL-12 p40 promoter-driven luciferase gene expression was determined. Cells were transfected with an IL-12 p40 promoter (–350 to +55)-luciferase construct, pretreated with Man-LAM for 16 h and then stimulated with LPS for 16 h. Man-LAM inhibited LPS-induced IL-12 promoter activity by ∼50% (Fig. 1E), suggesting that Man-LAM attenuated LPS-induced activation of the IL-12 promoter. LPS-induced cytokine gene expression in macrophages is the result of signaling through TLR4, a member of the family of pattern recognition receptors. NF-κB is a target of TLR signaling (41Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 42Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 43Anderson K.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway commonly involves MyD88-dependent IRAK activation (44Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 4301-4306Crossref Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 45Swantek J.L. Tsen M.F. Cobb M.H. Thomas J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4301-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), its phosphorylation and association with TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) leading to IκB kinase activation, IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation, culminating in release of NF-κB facilitating its translocation to the nucleus. NF-κB binding to the IL-12 promoter synergizes with the binding of other transcription factors to activate the IL-12 promoter (12Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We asked the question whether Man-LAM inhibits NF-κB activation. Cells were transfected with a multimerized NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid to study the effect of Man-LAM on LPS-induced NF-κB-driven luciferase gene expression. Pretreatment of cells with Man-LAM prior to stimulation with LPS led to a consistent reduction in luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 1F), lending support to the view that the inhibitory effect of Man-LAM is likely exerted at the level of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Inhibition of DNA Binding of Rel Family Proteins by Man-LAM—LPS stimulates the translocation of p50/c-Rel heterodimers to the nucleus in RAW264.7 macrophages (47Kollet J.I. Petro T.M. Mol. Immunol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar) with c-Rel being essential for activation of the p40 gene (48Schlesinger L.S. Hull S.R. Kaufman T.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4070-4079PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that Man-LAM inhibits LPS-induced IκB-α phosphorylation, we asked the question whether Man-LAM inhibits nuclear translocation and consequent DNA binding of the Rel family of proteins. Nuclear extracts from cells left untreated or pretreated with Man-LAM followed by challenge with LPS were tested for binding to consensus NF-κB sequences. Binding of c-Rel and p50 was expectedly inhibited in cells pretreated with Man-LAM (Fig. 1G). On the other hand, Man-LAM did not influence LPS-induced c-Fos translocation into the nucleus, suggesting that the effect of Man-LAM was specific for Rel family members. Man-LAM Inhibits IκB-α Phosphorylation in LPS-treated RAW264.7 Cells—In view of the fact that TLR signaling leads to the phosphorylation of IκB-α, prior to its degradation and the release of IκB-α-sequestered NF-κB, we assessed the effect of Man-LAM on LPS-induced IκB-α phosphorylation. LPS-induced IκB-α phosphorylation was found to be significantly reduced in cells pretreated with Man-LAM (Fig. 2A), supporting the view that Man-LAM inhibits TLR signaling resulting in decreased IκB-α phosphorylation. Man-LAM Attenuates the Interaction of IRAK with TRAF6—In the classical pathway of TLR4 signal transduction, the adaptor molecule MyD88 is recruited to the cytoplasmic tail of TLR4 following activation with LPS, followed by recruitment of IRAK. IRAK is then phosphorylated, and leaves the TLR4-MyD88 complex prior to its interaction with TRAF6, a downstream transducer that finally leads to IκB kinase activation, IκB-α phosphorylation, its degradation, and release of NF-κB facilitating its translocation to the nucleus. Considering that Man-LAM was capable of inhibiting LPS-induced IκB-α phosphorylation, we explored the possibility of Man-LAM inhibiting an upstream event along the cascade. The interaction of IRAK and TRAF6 was tested after transfecting cells with FLAG-TRAF6. Transfected RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with Man-LAM prior to challenge with LPS. After treatment, proteins were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody-bound agarose, and immunoblotted with IRAK antibody. The physical interaction between IRAK and TRAF6 was abrogated in cells pretreated with Man-LAM (Fig. 2B). No band corresponding to IRAK was obtained when immunoprecipitation was performed with Protein A/G-agarose only. This result argued in favor of a specific interaction between IRAK and TRAF6 that could be inhibited by Man-LAM. Man-LAM Induces Irak-M Expression—Because Man-LAM inhibited the IRAK-TRAF6 interaction, we searched for possible involvement of negative modulators of this interaction in Man-LAM-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activation. IRAK-M is a negative modulator of TLR4 signaling that is restricted to monocytes and macrophages (32Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A.

The TRs are nuclear receptors (NR), part of a superfamily whose members function as hormone-activated transcription factors (3Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The majority of thyroid hormone responses are induced by regulation of transcription by the thyroid hormone T3 (4Harvey C.B. Williams G.R. Thyroid. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Two genes, THRA and THRB encode the two protein isoforms TRα and TRβ, which yield four distinct subtypes by alternative splicing (5Williams G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8329-8342Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Several functional domains of TRs have been identified: a ligand-independent transactivation domain (AF-1) on the amino terminus, a central DNA binding domain, a ligand binding domain (LBD), and a carboxyl-terminal ligand dependent activation function (AF-2) (6Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6043) Google Scholar). TR binds specific sequences of DNA in the 5′-flanking regions of T3-responsive genes, known as thyroid response elements, most often as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (7Xu J.M. Li Q.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Both unliganded and liganded TRs can bind thyroid response elements and regulate genes under their control. The unliganded TR complex can recruit a nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) or a silencing mediator of retinoic acid to silence basal transcription (8Hu X. Lazar M.A. Trends Endorinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 6-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the presence of T3, TRs undergo a conformational change with the result that the composition of the coregulator complex can change with strong effects on transcriptional regulation. Several coactivator proteins have been identified (9Moore J.M.R Guy R.K. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 475-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The best studied group of coactivators is the p160 or steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) proteins (7Xu J.M. Li Q.T. Mol.

The coregulators mentioned have in common that they have variable numbers of highly conserved LXXLL motifs; termed NR-boxes, in their nuclear receptor interacting domain (NID). The NR boxes are both necessary and sufficient for the interaction between CoR and TR. The coactivator binding site of TR LBD is formed by 16 residues from four helices (H3, H4, H5, and H12) (23Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Scanning surface mutagenesis revealed that only six residues (Val284, Lys288, Ile302, Lys306, Leu454, and Glu457) are crucial for coactivator binding (24Feng W.J. Ribeiro R.C.J Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This feature makes the AF-2 domain an ideal target for inhibitor development. Several inhibitors of this interaction have been reported. The first reported inhibitors were macrolactam-constrained SRC2 NR box peptides (25Geistlinger T.R. Guy R.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1525-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A combinatorial approach discovered novel α-helical proteomimetics that could selectively inhibit the interaction between coactivators and TR or the estrogen receptor (ER), with selectivity between ER isoforms ERα and ERβ (26Geistlinger T.R. Guy R.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6852-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A similar approach, using disulfide bridges to constrain peptides, resulted in selective ERα coactivator inhibitor with a Kd of 25 nm (27Leduc A.M. Trent J.O. Wittliff J.L. Bramlett K.S. Briggs S.L. Chirgadze N.Y. Wang Y. Burris T.P. Spatola A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11273-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28Galande A.K. Bramlett K.S. Burris T.P. Wittliff J.L. Spatola A.F. J. Peptide Res. 2004; 63: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A report identifying a small molecule capable of inhibiting the interaction of a NR and its coactivator was published recently (29Rodriguez A.L. Tamrazi A. Collins M.L. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These pyrimidine-based scaffolds showed affinities between 30 and 50 μm but did not inhibit NR signaling in cell culture or in vivo models. To date, none of these inhibitors may be used to regulate NR signaling in cellular systems. All functional TR modulators known today are analogs of the T3 itself (30Dietrich S.W. Bolger M.B.

The first functional T3 antagonist was NH-3, which inhibits thyroid hormone function in both cell culture and whole animal-based assays (41Wagner R.L. Huber B.R. Shiau A.K. Kelly A. Lima S.T.C Scanlan T.S. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 398-410Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). High throughput screening (HTS) together with computational screening and fragment discovery are current methods for discovering lead compounds for manipulation of protein function. Although such methods have been applied to discovery of small molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions (42Arkin M.R. Wells J.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar), only a limited number of successes have been reported (43Berg T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2462-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 44Toogood P.L. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1543-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). One of the most robust and sensitive HTS methods for studying protein-protein interactions is the competitive fluorescence polarization assay (45Roehrl M.H.A Wang J.Y. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16056-16066Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Herein, we present the first HTS using an in vitro fluorescence polarization assay to measure the ability of small molecules to inhibit the interaction between the TRβ LBD and its coactivator, SRC2. This screen revealed a number of hits for inhibitors of the TR-CoR interaction. One particular class of compounds has been examined carefully, and its mechanism of inhibition has been investigated. The resulting lead compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of both the TR-CoR interaction in vitro and thyroid hormone signaling in cellular systems. They have potential both as drug candidates and useful biochemical tools for study of the role of the interaction of TR and its coregulators. Labeled Peptides—Peptide SRC2-2 (CLKEKHKILHRLLQDSSSPV) labeled with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (Molecular Probes) was kindly provided by Jamie M. R. Moore (probe) (17Moore J.M.R Galicia S.J.

Geistlinger (26Geistlinger T.R. Guy R.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6852-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Vector—hTRβ LBD (His6 T209-D461) was cloned into the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites downstream of the hexahistidine tag of the expression vector pET DUET-1 (Novagen). The replacement of C309 for A in the hTRβ LBD construct was performed with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of both constructs was verified by DNA sequencing (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Hayward, CA). Protein Expression and Purification—hTRβ LBD (His6; residues T209-D461) was expressed in BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) (10 × 1L culture) at 20 °C, 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside added at A600 = 0.6 (17Moore J.M.R Galicia S.J.

When the A600 reached 4, cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 ml of buffer/1 liter of culture (20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 0.025% Tween 20, 0.10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg of lysozyme, pH 7.5), incubated for 30 min on ice, and then sonicated for 3 × 3 min on ice. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was loaded onto Talon resin (20 ml, Clontech). Protein was eluted with 500 mm imidazole (3 × 5 ml) plus ligand (3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (Sigma)). Protein purity (>90%) was assessed by SDS-PAGE and high pressure size exclusion chromatography, and protein concentration was measured by the Bradford protein assay. The protein was dialyzed overnight against assay buffer (3 × 4 liters, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). The protein functionality was determined by a direct binding assay of SRC2-2 (see Fig. 3A) giving a Kd for SRC2-2 of 0.44 μm, agreeing with prior results. hTRα LBD (His6; residues Glu148-Val410) was expressed using the same procedure as hTRβ with the exception that 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at A600 = 1.2. Unliganded protein was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. Purity assessment and buffer exchange were carried out as described. The functionality was determined in a direct binding assay (see Fig. 3A) giving a Kd for SRC2-2 of 0.17 μm, agreeing with prior results. hTRβ LBD C309A (His6; residues Thr209-Asp461) was expressed in BL21 cells (Stratagene) at 18-20 °C by using the pET DUET1-hTRβ LBD (41Wagner R.L. Huber B.R. Shiau A.K. Kelly A. Lima S.T.C Scanlan T.S. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 398-410Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). General procedures were as described above. The functionality was determined in a direct binding assay (see Fig. 3A) giving a Kd for SRC2-2 of 0.17 μm. Direct Binding Assay—The protein was serially diluted from 70 to 0.002 μm in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing 1 μm ligand T3 in 96-well plates (17Moore J.M.R Galicia S.J.

Then 10 μlof diluted protein was added to 10 μl of labeled SRC2-2 (20 nm) in 384-well plates yielding final protein concentrations of 35-0.001 μm and 10 nm fluorescent peptide concentration. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Binding was then measured using fluorescence polarization (excitation λ 485 nm, emission λ 530 nm) on an Analyst AD plate reader (Molecular Devices). Two independent experiments, each in quadruplicate, were carried out for each state. Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Il), and the Kd values were obtained by fitting data to the following equation (y = min + (max - min)/1 + (x/Kd)Hill slope). Screening Procedure—The small molecule screen was carried out at the Bay Area Screening Center (BASC) at the California Institute for Quantitative Biology (QB3). A library comprised of 138,000 compounds (ChemRX, 28,000; ChemDiv, 53,000; ChemBridge, 24,000; SPECS, 31,000; Microsource, 2,000) was screened in 384-well format. The complete composition of this library is available from the BASC website (ucsf.edu/basc). First, 384-well dilutions plates (costar 3702) were prepared by addition of 34 μl of dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5.9% Me2SO) to each well by using a WellMate (Matrix) followed by addition of 6 μl compound solutions (1 mm compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)) using a Multimek (Beckman) equipped with a 96-channel head and mixing by subsequent aspiration and dispensing. Second, 5 μl from the dilution plates were transferred to 384-well assay plates (Costar 3710) using a Multimek followed by the addition of 24 μl of protein mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μm TRβ LBD, 1 μm T3, 0.025 μm labeled SRC2-2 using a WellMate. The final concentration of compound was 30 μm with 4% Me2SO content. Each plate was monitored by the addition of a positive control 3 and negative control 11. After an incubation time of 2 h the binding was measured using fluorescence polarization (excitation λ 485 nm, emission λ 530 nm) on an Analyst AD plate reader (Molecular Devices). Additionally the fluorescence intensity was measured. All data relevant to the project (plate and compound information, screening data, annotation info, etc.) was deposited directly into a mySQL data base (v. 4.1.7). Data were manipulated and analyzed using protocols written in Pipeline Pilot 4.5.1 (Scitegic, Inc). Our protocols automated the process of joining experimental data to compound information, flagging suspicious plates based on low Z-factors, extracting compounds with statistically significant activity, and annotating hits with additional information (i.e. chemical similarity to known bioactive compounds, known genotoxic/cytotoxic molecules, or available compounds, and profiles from ADME models). Dose-response Experiments—The small molecules were serially diluted from 1000 to 4.88 μm in Me2SO into a 96-well plate (Costar 3365). 10 μl of each concentration was transferred into 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) and mixed by subsequent aspiration and dispensing. Then 10 μl of diluted compound was added to 10 μl of protein mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 μm TRβ LBD, 2 μm T3, 0.02 μm labeled SRC2-2 in 384-well plates yielding final compound concentration of 50-0.024 μm. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 3 h. Binding was then measured using fluorescence polarization (excitation λ 485 nm, emission λ 530 nm) on an Analyst AD (Molecular Devices). Two independent experiments, in quadruplicate, were carried out for each compound. Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.0, and the Kd values were obtained by fitting data to the following equation (y = min + (max - min)/1 + (x/Kd)Hill slope). Thyroid Hormone Competition Binding Assay—Full-length hTRβ was produced using a TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription translation system (Promega). Competition assays for binding of unlabeled T3 and L1 were performed using 1 nm [125I]T3 in gel filtration binding assay as described (46Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Lau K.H. West B.L. Protein Express. Purif. 1995; 6: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Binding Assay with L8 and L9—TRβ or TRβ C309A (5 μm) and T3 (20 μm) were incubated in binding buffer (100 μm) with different concentrations L8 and L9, respectively. After 3 h at room temperature an aliquot of 20 μm was treated with a denaturing buffer (10 μm), boiled for 2 min, and separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by a fluorescence spectrometer. Pull-down Assays—GST fusions to the thyroid hormone receptor (full-length) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Cultures were grown to A600 1.2-1.5 at 22 °C and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h. The cultures were centrifuged (1000 × g), and bacterial pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 80 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors and sonicated. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 × g). The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed as previously described. Protein preparations were stored at -20 °C in 20% glycerol until use. [35S]methionine-labeled SRC2 was produced by using coupled in vitro transcription-translation (TnT kit, Promega). The binding reactions were carried out on ice in a volume of 150 μl composed of 137.5 μl of protein-binding buffer along with 10 μl of GST-bead slurry corresponding to 3 μg of fusion protein, 1 μl of in vitro translated protein, and 1.5 μl of ligand or vehicle. The protein-binding buffer composed of 20 μl of A-150 (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm, MgCl2, 1% glycerol) and 2 μl each of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitor mixture (Novagen) was freshly prepared. The mix was incubated at 4 °C with gentle agitation; the beads were pelleted, washed four times with protein-binding buffer containing no bovine serum albumin, and dried under vacuum for 20 min. The sample was taken up in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Transient Transfection Assays—Human bone osteosarcoma epithelial cells (U2OS) cells (Cell Culture Facility, UCSF) were grown to ∼80% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/H-21, 4.5 g/liter glucose medium containing 10% newborn calf serum (heat-inactivated), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells (∼1.5 × 106) were collected and resuspended in 0.5 ml of electroporation buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% glucose, 10 mg/ml bioprene). 5 μg of a TR expression vector (full-length hTRβ-CMV) and 1.5 μg of a reporter plasmid contained a synthetic TR response element (DR-4) containing two copies of a direct repeat spaced by four nucleotides (AGGTCAcaggAGGTCA) cloned immediately upstream of a minimal (-32/+45) thymidine kinase promoter linked to luciferase coding sequence (35Chiellini G.

Cells were electroporated using a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 350 V and 960 microfarads, pooled in growth medium (DME H-21 with 10% charcoal-treated, hormone-stripped, newborn bovine serum), and plated in 96-well dishes. After a 3-h incubation compounds were added to the cell culture medium as Me2SO solutions so as to yield a final Me2SO concentration of 1%. After additional 18 h of incubation, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega dual luciferase kit (Promega) and an Analyst AD (Molecular Devices). Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.0, and the IC values were obtained by fitting data to the following equation (y = min + (max - min)/1 + (x/Kd)Hill slope). The high-throughput screen was carried out using a 384-well plate format. A total of 300 compounds as single points together with quadruple positive and quadruple negative controls were dispensed in each 384-well plate followed by the addition of TRβ LBD and the labeled SRC2-2 peptide. The SRC2-2 peptide was utilized because it had the tightest binding (0.44 μm) of all the NR box peptides investigated (17Moore J.M.R Galicia S.J. McReynolds A.C. Nguyen N.H. Scanlan T.S. Guy R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After incubation for 2 h the fluorescence polarization and fluorescence intensity was measured. From the 138,000 compounds screened 27 hit compounds inhibited the interaction between TRβ LBD and the SRC2-2 coactivator peptide with at least 50% efficacy at a concentration of 30 μm and had a fluorescence intensity variation of less then 10%. The structures of these hits, along with the percent inhibitions at 30 μm are shown in Fig. 1. The molecules are divided into six groups depending on their chemical properties. Group A represents electrophilic molecules with a medium sized alkyl substituent. Based on our results at least two of them are irreversible inhibitors of the TR-CoA interaction. All hits shown in Fig. 1 were evaluated by performing a dose to the response of inhibition study over a range of compound concentrations of 0.024-30 μm to allow the calculation of the IC50 values. Only two compounds (Fig. 2B, L1 and L2) had IC50 values less than 10 μm (C, entries 1 and 2), with a clear saturation at a higher concentration (A). These were designated validated hits. The remaining compounds were all sufficiently weak in potency to call their validity into question. This represent"

We therefore examined the role of Rho-kinase in the development of insulin resistance in Zucker obese rats. In skeletal muscles and aortic tissues of Zucker obese rats, activation of RhoA/Rho-kinase was observed. Long-term Rho-kinase inhibition by 4 wk treatment with fasudil (a Rho-kinase inhibitor) not only reduced blood pressure but corrected glucose and lipid metabolism, with improvement in serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and insulin signaling in skeletal muscles. Direct visualization of skeletal muscle arterioles with an intravital CCD videomicroscope demonstrated that both acetylcholine- and sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilations were blunted, which were restored by the fasudil treatment. Furthermore, both fasudil and Y-27632 prevented the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by insulin and/or tumor necrosis factor-alpha in skeletal muscle cells. Collectively, Rho-kinase is responsible for the impairment of insulin signaling and may constitute a critical mediator linking between metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities in insulin resistance."

This physiological effect is likely to be due to proton leakage at the cytoplasmic membrane. The results point to mechanistic incompatibilities of the Tat system with unfolded proteins such as RR-PhoA.

Klösgen R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the Sec translocation apparatus, which cannot translocate fully folded proteins (2Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Tat system of Escherichia coli consists of three membrane-integral components, termed TatA, TatB, and TatC, which are encoded in one operon (3Palmer T. Berks B.C. Microbiology. 2003; 49: 547-556Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A second TatA homolog, TatE, can functionally substitute for TatA and is encoded by a monocistronic gene (3Palmer T. Berks B.C. Microbiology. 2003; 49: 547-556Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). TatA(E) and TatB show sequence homology and are predicted to contain a N-terminal membrane anchor, whereas TatC is a polytopic membrane protein with six transmembrane domains (4Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5Behrendt J. Standar K. Lindenstrauss U. Brüser T. FEMS Microbiol.

In E. coli, TatC appears to form a complex with TatB and TatA (7de Leeuw E. Granjon T. Porcelli I. Alami M. Carr S.B. Müller M. Sargent F. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Mol.

Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In analogy to the thylakoidal TatABC system, it seems that after substrate binding to a TatBC core complex, additional TatA is recruited in the presence of a ΔpH to form an active translocon, and translocation is accomplished (9Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Müller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Tat substrates are usually recognized by their N-terminal signal sequence, as it contains the eponymous twin-arginine motif, [S/T]-R-R-X-F-L-K, which is highly important for the translocon recognition (11Buchanan G. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Palmer T. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 177: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The arginines are strictly conserved in all known E. coli Tat substrates.In E. coli, it has been shown that unfolded proteins are not translocated by the Tat system (12Sanders C. Wethkamp N. Lill H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This observation is important, as it gives an explanation for the coexistence of two distinct general protein translocons in the same membrane, the Sec and the Tat system, which are adapted to unfolded and folded proteins, respectively. The selectivity for the folded state is best documented with Tat signal sequence fused Sec substrates, such as c-type cytochromes or alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) (12Sanders C. Wethkamp N. Lill H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). PhoA normally cannot fold properly in the cytoplasm due to a necessity of disulfide formation, and it was observed that Tat signal sequence fused PhoA was not translocated by the Tat system (13DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Importantly, Tat-dependent translocation could be achieved if cytoplasmic disulfide formation was allowed, a folding prerequisite for PhoA. Based on these results, a general quality control step was proposed (13DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14Brüser T. Sanders C. Microbiol. Res. 2003; 158: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It was considered that the translocon itself may fulfill this function (13DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), but so far, no general quality control apparatus has been found at the translocon. However, Tat signal sequence binding chaperones are known to optimize proper folding prior to targeting of specific cofactor containing Tat substrates, and this can be important for the formation of an active enzyme, as has been shown for E. coli hydrogenase-2 (15Jack R.L. Buchanan G. Dubini A. Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3962-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).We used in this study a Tat signal sequence/PhoA fusion protein to address the question whether there exists a general selection for folded proteins at the Tat translocon. We show with unfolded PhoA for the first time in a bacterial system a direct and RR-specific substrate binding to the Tat translocon in vivo. The data indicate that TatB and TatC do not possess an intrinsic quality control for this binding event. Physiological data are presented, which strongly suggest that the Tat system attempts to translocate PhoA, which can become harmful for the cells. Therefore, albeit the translocon itself does not reject unfolded Tat substrates such as RR-PhoA, the folded state of Tat substrates is a very important criterion for successful translocation.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and Growth Conditions—E. coli MC4100 (16Casadaban M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), with pBAD vectors, its arabinose-resistant derivative (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was studied. E. coli XL1-Blue Mrf′ Kan (Stratagene) was used for cloning, and E. coli CC118 was used for PhoA activity determinations (18Lee E. Manoil C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28822-28828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bacteria were grown aerobically at 37 °C on LB medium (1% tryptone, 1% NaCl, 0.5% yeast extract) in the presence of the appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline). For anaerobic growth, cells were grown on LB medium supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 0.4% nitrate. TMAO was added to 1.1% for induction of torA expression.Plasmids and Genetic Methods—For the fusion of the complete signal sequence of the Tat substrate HiPIP to PhoA, a BamHI restriction site was introduced into hip at codon 7 of the mature domain using QuikChange™ mutagenesis (Stratagene) with the primer pair hip-BamHI-F (5′-CGC CAA TGC CGT GGA TCC GGA CGA TGC GAC CG-3′) and hip-BamHI-R (5′-CGG TCG CAT CGT CCG GAT CCA CGG CAT TGG CG-3′), and pEXH5-tac as a template. pEXH5-tac is a tac-promoter derivative of the pET22b+ (Novagen)-based pEXH5 (19Brüser T. Deutzmann R. Dahl C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), produced by cloning of the XbaI/HindIII hip-containing fragment of pEXH5 into the XbaI/HindIII digested pTB-DG (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). phoA was BamHI/HindIII excised from pTFD342 (20Kumagai H. Fujiwara T. Matsubara H. Saeki K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5509-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and cloned into the corresponding sites of pEXH5-tac, resulting in pEX-hipSP-phoA-tac. With this vector as a template, hipSP-phoA was amplified using the primer pair hipSP-phoA-NcoI-F (5′-TAT ACC CAT GGC CGA TAA GCC AAT CAG CAA G-3′) and hipSP-phoA-XbaI-R (5′-CTC ATT CTA GAC AGC TTA TCA TCG ATA AGC-3′), and cloned into the arabinose-regulated expression vector pBAD22 (21Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3905) Google Scholar), resulting in pBAD-hipSP-phoA. The RR > KK signal sequence mutation was introduced by QuikChange™ mutagenesis using the primer pair hip-KK-F (5′-C GAT AAG CCA ATC AGC AAG AGC AAG AAA GAC GCT GTC AAA GTG ATG-3′) and hip-KK-R (5′-CAT CAC TTT GAC AGC GTC TTT CTT GCT CTT GCT GAT TGG CTT ATC G-3′) with pEXH5-tac as a template, followed by the same cloning steps as described above, resulting in pEX-hipSP-KK-phoA-tac and pBAD-hipSP-KK-phoA. To express RR-phoA or KK-phoA under control of PrhaBAD, the NdeI/HindIII fragment of pEX-hipSP-phoA-tac was cloned into the corresponding sites of pJOE2702, which allows a rhamnose-regulated expression (22Volff J.-N. Eichenseer C. Viell P. Piendl W. Altenbuchner J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1037-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), resulting in pJOE-hipSP-phoA and pJOE-hipSP-KK-phoA.For coexpression of tatABC, the compatible low copy vector pABS-tatABC was used (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which expresses tatABC under control of the tatA promoter and which confers chloramphenicol resistance. In the indicated cases, the pRK-tatABC system, which confers tetracycline resistance, was used for comparison as an alternative tatABC expression system (23Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For expression of wild type phoA, phoA was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers phoA-NdeI-F (5′-GGA GAA AAT CAT ATG AAA CAA AGC ACT ATT GCA-3′) and phoA-HindIII-R (5′-GTT TTA AGC TTG AGC GTA TGC GCC CGT GAT CTG-3′), the fragment was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into the corresponding sites of pEXH5-tac, resulting in pEX-phoA-tac. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Biochemical Methods—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar), and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) was conducted with 5–14.5% gradient gels according to Schägger and von Jagow (25Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). Proteins were semidry blotted on nitrocellulose (Laemmli gels) or polyvinylidene fluoride (BN gels) and developed using the ECL system. Antibodies were used against PhoA (Rockland), HiPIP (18Lee E. Manoil C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28822-28828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TatA, TatB (both donations from Tim Yahr, Iowa City, IA), or TatC (donation of Matthias Müller, Freiburg, Germany). For BN-PAGE analyses, membranes were prepared under thiol-reducing conditions with buffer containing 20% sucrose, 50 mm Bis-Tris HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol by French pressure cell passage (55 MPa), low (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and high speed (130,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) centrifugation, and used at a protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml for solubilization with 0.5% digitonin in the same buffer. Protein estimations were carried out according to the Lowry method (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Periplasm, membranes, and cytoplasm were fractionated as described previously (19Brüser T. Deutzmann R. Dahl C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Inverted vesicles (INV) were prepared by a French press passage of the cells at 55 MPa in INV buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA), followed by a low speed centrifugation to remove cell debris, an ultracentrifugation to sediment the membranes, and resuspension of the INV to an A280 nm of 10 in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2. Fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out using the spectrofluorometer SFM25 (Kontron Instruments, Eching, Germany). The assays contained in a total volume of 2 ml of 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 5mm MgCl2, 30 mm creatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, 2 μm acridine orange, and 500 μg/ml INV protein. The pH gradient formation was initiated by addition of 1.25 mm ATP; the assay was terminated by addition of 100 μm carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Acridine orange fluorescence was followed by excitation at 494 nm and emission detection at 540 nm.Periplasmic PhoA activity was assayed with whole cells by the method of Brickman and Beckwith (27Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The sensitivity to SDS was quantified as described previously (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The activity of TorA in the periplasmic fraction was visualized as described by Silvestro et al. (28Silvestro A. Pommier J. Pascal M.C. Giordano G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe Tat system is capable of translocating folded proteins, such as cofactor-containing or even oligomeric enzymes (4Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For some reason, the Tat system does not translocate unfolded proteins, such as apoforms of c-type cytochromes or reduced alkaline phosphatase, when such proteins are N-terminally fused to Tat signal sequences (12Sanders C. Wethkamp N. Lill H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).We addressed this question and examined the targeting of a RR-PhoA construct, which contains the structurally well studied signal sequence of the Tat substrate HiPIP (23Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Kipping M. Lilie H. Lindenstrauss U. Andreesen J.R. Griesinger C. Carlomagno T. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As a control we used KK-PhoA, which has the two consecutive arginines of the twin-arginine-motif substituted by two lysines. Such a substitution has been shown earlier to completely block Tat-dependent translocation of HiPIP in E. coli (23Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A, the RR-PhoA and KK-PhoA signal sequences are shown and compared with that of the native Sec substrate PhoA. Note that in addition to their twin-arginine motif, Tat signal sequences are in average longer than Sec signal sequences, especially due to an extended polar n-region at their N terminus.In initial experiments, we tested whether or not our RR-PhoA fusion protein was translocated by the Tat system. The phoA-mutant strain CC118 was used for all determinations of PhoA activity. We compared the activities with natural PhoA, RR-PhoA, KK-PhoA, or the empty vector control (Fig. 1B). While PhoA with its own Sec signal sequence gave a high PhoA activity, the Tat signal sequence fused PhoA resulted in a reduction to about 6% of that activity. This low activity was not Tat-dependent, as a RR > KK exchange within the twin-arginine motif had no significant effect. The Tat independence of the activity suggests that some RR-PhoA or KK-PhoA is translocated via the Sec pathway. Such a minor Sec-dependent translocation is not unusual and has already been observed earlier for several other Tat signal sequences when fused to PhoA (13DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The leakage of Tat signal fusions of Sec substrates via the Sec pathway is believed to be caused by Sec determinants on the mature domain, which can override the Tat determinants on the signal sequence (30Cristóbal S. de Gier J.-W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As the data indicated that the Tat signal sequence of HiPIP did not allow a Tat-dependent translocation of PhoA, the construct was used in the following to study the Tat system incompatibility of PhoA.A Twin-arginine-specific Effect of RR-PhoA at Wild Type as Well as at Increased Tat Levels—When we compared the growth of strains expressing either RR-phoA or KK-phoA from an arabinose-inducible promoter in a wild-type tat background, the induction of RR-phoA caused a growth inhibition which was significantly higher than with KK-phoA (Fig. 2A). As the KK-phoA control indicated any possible negative effect which could be caused by the expression system, the significantly reduced growth of the strain expressing RR-phoA clearly reflected a toxic effect that was solely due to the presence of the twin-arginine motif in the signal sequence. This finding was intriguing, as it strongly pointed to a Tat system interaction of the unfolded RR-PhoA.FIGURE 2The presence of RR-PhoA affects growth at wild type and at higher abundant Tat levels. A, growth curves of E. coli MC4100 with pBAD-hipSP-phoA (solid lines) or pBAD-hipSP-KK-phoA (dotted lines), either without (thin lines) or with (thick lines) arabinose induction (0.5%). The Δ indicates the difference between the induction effects of RR-PhoA and KK-PhoA. B, growth curves of E. coli MC4100 with pBAD22 (empty vector control (thin line)), pBAD-hipSP-phoA (thick line), or pBAD-hipSP-KK-phoA (dotted line), in the presence of pABS-tatABC, and thus of higher TatABC levels. Induction of pBAD expressions was with 0.5% arabinose at the time point indicated by an arrow. Standard deviations are indicated and are based on three parallel independent cultures. Again, the Δ indicates the difference between the induction effects of RR-PhoA and KK-PhoA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RR-PhoA obviously harmed the cells at wild type Tat levels, and thus we wondered whether this effect would be larger when the Tat system was higher abundant. This was indeed the case. When we increased the abundance of the Tat translocon about 20-fold by tatA-promoter-dependent coexpression of tatABC from a low copy vector (= tatABC+), we observed a strong inhibition of growth upon induction of RR-phoA expression (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the KK-phoA-expressing strain grew normally, as did the empty vector control strain. As the growth inhibition was clearly dependent on the presence of the RR-motif in the signal sequence and as the effect was strongly enhanced when the Tat translocon was more abundant, it was very likely that the effect was due to a direct RR-PhoA interaction with the Tat translocon. This was interesting in the light of the fact that PhoA neither can fold properly in the reducing cytoplasm nor can it be translocated by the Tat system. Importantly, the number of living cells did not decrease during the growth arrest, as the number of colony-forming units per 1 OD600 nm remained constant (2.5 × 108 colony-forming units/ml).The growth inhibition lasted for about 8 h. Thereafter, the cultures recovered to normal growth, which was enabled by a drastic decrease of the plasmid copy number, resulting in low TatABC and RR-PhoA levels (Fig. 3). Retransformed plasmids from such suppressor strains showed a normal copy number, indicating that the decrease of the copy numbers was not due to mutations on the plasmids (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that RR-PhoA was targeted to the Tat translocon by an usual Tat substrate binding pathway. This targeting had negative physiological effects and thus led to a growth arrest.FIGURE 3The RR-PhoA effect is suppressed by a decrease of the plasmid copy number. A, the growth arrest is suppressed during prolonged growth. The growth of a strain carrying pBAD-hipSP-phoA in MC4100 with pABS-tatABC was measured. Induction of pBAD-expressions was with 0.5% arabinose at the time point indicated by an arrow. Standard deviations are indicated and are based on three parallel independent cultures. Note that after 10 h the cultures recover from their growth arrest. B, detection of TatA (at 18 kDa), TatB (at 30 kDa), TatC (at 28 kDa), and PhoA (upper band at 55 kDa) by specific antisera (Western blot after SDS-PAGE) and of NcoI-restricted plasmids (ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel). The strains contain pABS-tatABC, which in all lanes gives rise to the upper band at 7142 bp, and in addition the following vectors: pBAD22 (vector control without insert, 4542-bp fragment), pBAD-hipSP-phoA (RR-PhoA, 5119-bp fragment), or pBAD-hipSP-KK-phoA (KK-PhoA, 5119-bp fragment). The suppressor strain is labeled “RR-PhoA supp.” Note that the suppressor strain has significantly reduced levels of TatA, TatB, TatC, and RR-PhoA as a result from a plasmid copy number decrease.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RR-PhoA Targeting Affects the Trans-membrane Proton Gradient—One possible explanation for the growth retardation was a proton leakage, which could be caused by stable RR-PhoA/Tat system interactions, such as some dead-end assembly of the Tat system around RR-PhoA or alternatively a release of unfolded PhoA into the membrane. This was tested with inverted membrane vesicles (INV), which build up a proton gradient when ATP is added, as the reversible ATP synthase pumps protons into the vesicles under these conditions. This proton gradient can be conveniently measured by acridine orange fluorescence quenching (31Lee H.C. Forte J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 508: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The proton gradient formation with INV from the RR-PhoA-containing growth-inhibited strain was compared with the gradient formation with INV from a strain with KK-PhoA or with INV from a strain without recombinant Tat substrates. As shown in Fig. 4A, the proton gradient was significantly reduced with INV from the RR-PhoA-containing strain when compared with the gradient formed with INV from the KK-PhoA-containing strain or the strain carrying the empty vector. As calculated from the step-like increase of fluorescence upon addition of the uncoupler CCCP, the fluorescence quenching with vesicles from the RR-PhoA-containing strain was below 50% of the control values (Fig. 4B). The membrane protein pattern was identical in all three strains and the amount of Tat system was the same in vesicles from RR-PhoA or KK-PhoA-containing strains, as can be seen in the detection of TatA by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). Together, the results suggest that the expression of RR-phoA affects membrane permeability.FIGURE 4Membrane stability is affected by RR-PhoA. A, fluorescence quenching shows that RR-PhoA-containing membranes as prepared from MC4100 with pABS-tatABC and pBAD-hipSP-phoA build up a diminished proton gradient. ATP-induced proton gradient formation is followed by quenching of acridine orange fluorescence. CCCP addition abolishes the proton gradient. Membranes were used from a vector-only control strain (thin line), a RR-PhoA strain (thick line), and a KK-PhoA strain (dotted lane). For experimental details, see “Materials and Methods.” B, comparison of the fluorescence quenching results. The extent of fluorescence quenching was measured at the CCCP addition step. The results are from three independent assays and include their standard deviations. C, comparison of membrane proteins in samples used for fluorescence quenching. Upper part, equal amounts of membrane proteins (10 μg) were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and Coomassie-stained. Lower part, detection of TatA after Western blotting demonstrates equal amounts of Tat system in the respective membrane fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Direct Binding of RR-PhoA to the Tat Translocon—To obtain a more direct evidence for an interaction of RR-PhoA with the Tat translocon, we used the BN-PAGE method, which has been applied successfully with the plant thylakoid Tat apparatus to show Tat substrate-Tat translocon interactions (32Berghöfer J. Klösgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). BN-PAGE has been established recently as a useful tool also for the analysis of Tat complexes of bacteria. So far, no bacterial Tat substrate-Tat translocon complex could be demonstrated by BN-PAGE, but a stable TatABC complex has been detected (8Oates J. Barrett C.M. Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).In our analyses, TatA formed a ladder (Fig. 5A), which was already observed recently by the group of Colin Robinson (8Oates J. Barrett C.M. Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and TatB and TatC comigrated at about 440 and 580 kDa, indicating TatBC complexes of these sizes (Fig. 4, B and C). The 440-kDa TatBC complex, which most likely corresponds to the 370 kDa complex observed previously (8Oates J. Barrett C.M. Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was so abundant that it was detectable with anti-TatB serum even at wild type levels without tatABC overexpression, which gives also an idea about the relative expression level achieved with pABS-tatABC (see left lanes in Fig. 5B). In addition to the 440 kDa TatBC complex, we detected TatB and TatC in a band at about 580 kDa. This 580-kDa TatBC complex was always present in lower amounts than the 440-kDa complex. Further bands were observed below 440 kDa, which most likely reflected some complex dissociation upon solubilization, and some material did not enter the gels, possibly due to some aggregation after solubilization. No distinct TatA signal could be attributed to a TatBC-containing complex (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5RR-PhoA interacts directly with a TatBC complex. A–D, detection of TatA, TatB, TatC, and PhoA in solubilized membranes of MC4100 with wild type levels of Tat systems (wt) or increased levels due to the presence of pABS-tatABC (tatABC+). Furthermore, the strains carry either pBAD-hipSP-phoA (RR-PhoA) or pBAD-hipSP-KK-phoA (KK-PhoA). BN-PAGE gels were blotted and developed with specific antibodies against the respective proteins as described under “Materials and Methods.” Markers are the ferritin dimer (880 kDa), ferritin monomer (440 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa).

https://openalex.org/W1964292925,"Fgfr4 has been shown to be important for appropriate muscle development in chick limb buds; however, Fgfr4 null mice show no phenotype. Here, we show that staged induction of muscle regeneration in Fgfr4 null mice becomes highly abnormal at the time point when Fgfr4 is normally expressed. By 7 days of regeneration, differentiation of myotubes became poorly coordinated and delayed by both histology and embryonic myosin heavy chain staining. By 14 days much of the muscle was replaced by fat and calcifications. To begin to dissect the molecular pathways involving Fgfr4, we queried the promoter sequences for transcriptional factor binding sites and tested candidate regulators in a 27-time point regeneration series. The Fgfr4 promoter region contained a Tead protein binding site (M-CAT 5′-CATTCCT-3′), and Tead2 showed induction during regeneration commensurate with Fgfr4 regulation. Co-transfection of Tead2 and Fgfr4 promoter reporter constructs into C2C12 myotubes showed Tead2 to activate Fgfr4, and mutation of the M-CAT motif in the Fgfr4 promoter abolished these effects. Immunostaining for Tead2 showed timed expression in myotube nuclei consistent with the mRNA data. Query of the expression timing and genomic sequences of Tead2 suggested direct regulation by MyoD, and consistent with this, MyoD directly bound to two strong E-boxes in the first intron of Tead2 by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, co-transfection of MyoD and Tead2 intron reporter constructs into 10T1/2 cells activated reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. This activation was greatly reduced when the two E-boxes were mutated. Our data suggest a novel MyoD-Tead2-Fgfr4 pathway important for effective muscle regeneration.

Consistent with an important role for FGFR4 in muscle development, previous studies have shown that inhibition of FGFR4 leads to the arrest of muscle progenitor differentiation in chick embryo, with reduced expression of Myf5, MyoD, and embryonic myosin heavy chain and dramatic loss of limb muscles (18Marics I. Padilla F. Guillemot J.F. Scaal M. Marcelle C. Development. 2002; 129: 4559-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect is independent of myoblast proliferation (18Marics I. Padilla F. Guillemot J.F. Scaal M. Marcelle C. Development. 2002; 129: 4559-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 is shown as one of the factors to control the transcription of FGFR4 in skeletal muscle cells (19Yu S.J. Zheng L. Ladanyi M. Asa S.L. Ezzat S. Clin.

Despite the well documented importance of Fgfr4 in muscle development in the chick, Fgfr4 null mice develop normally, with no evident muscle defects (21Weinstein M. Xu X. Ohyama K. Deng C.X. Development. 1998; 125: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only phenotype shown to date for Fgfr4 null mice is increased liver injury and fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride and increased cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis (22Yu C.

Biol. 2003; 326: 1049-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we had observed that Fgfr4 was strongly yet transiently induced at a key day-3 time point post-injection in muscle regeneration. This time point is commensurate with the myoblast-myotube transition, where proliferating myoblasts leave the cell cycle, fuse with neighboring cells, and terminally differentiate into multi-nucleated myotubes. We hypothesized that Fgfr4 may be required for effective muscle regeneration and tested this using staged degeneration/regeneration in Fgfr4 null mice. Regeneration in Fgfr4 was highly abnormal, with poorly differentiated myotubes at day 7 and extensive replacement of muscle by fat and calcifications by day 14. We then built a transcriptional pathway upstream of Fgfr4. We show that one of the TEA domain transcriptional factors, Tead2, is induced at day 3 during regeneration, whereupon it regulates the Fgfr4 promoter through the M-CAT motif (CATTCCT). Moreover, we show that MyoD directly binds to and activates the Tead2 first intron. Thus, our data define a MyoD-Tead2-Fgfr4 pathway important for effective muscle regeneration. Staged Muscle Regeneration and Expression Profiling—Fgfr4 null mice were originally generated by Dr. Chu-Xia Deng (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health (21Weinstein M. Xu X. Ohyama K. Deng C.X. Development. 1998; 125: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and maintained by Dr. Wallace McKeehan at Texas A&M University. Staged muscle degeneration/regeneration was done in both 8-week-old wild-type and Fgfr4 null mice by intramuscular injection of 100 μlof 10 μm cardiotoxin using a 10-needle manifold, as we have previously described (25Zhao P.

Wang Y. Shneiderman B. Hoffman E.P. C. R. Biol. 2003; 326: 1049-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both gastrocnemii of three mice per time point were injected and studied. Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining—Each muscle was examined histologically in the belly (center) of the gastrocnemius muscle. Cryosections (8 μm) were cut using an IEC Minotome® cryostat, collected on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or used for immunostaining and immunolocalizations. Quantitative Multiplex Fluorescent PCR—Quantitative multiplex fluorescent PCR (QMF-PCR) was done as previously described using a LI-COR DNA analyzer (25Zhao P. Iezzi S. Carver E. Dressman D. Gridley T. Sartorelli V. Hoffman E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30091-30101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Zhou J.H. Hoffman E.P. J. Biol.

Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using oligo(dT) primer (Roche Applied Science) in a 20-μl reaction. 0.5 μl of cDNA was then used for RT-PCR in a 12.5-μl reaction. PCR was done at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 18–20 cycles and then a 72 °C extension for 10 min. Primers used for RT-PCR are Tead2 (NM_011565) forward (5′-ggagtgagcagccagtatgagag-3′) and Tead2 reverse (5′-tacacaaagcgcccgtcctc-3′). Primers for control genes (NIPI-like protein, cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase) are NIPI-like protein (U67328) forward (5′-aacagggaacctatggtggc-3′), reverse (5′-ctgtccacagggtgactgaag-3′), cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (Cmas, AJ006215) forward (5′-gacctagtcttgctccgacctc-3′), and reverse (5′-caggggtgtcttaccagactc-3′). Forward primers were labeled with an infrared fluorescent dye (IRDye 700, LI-COR). PCR products are 135 bp (Tead2), 142 bp (NIPI-like protein), and 128 bp (Cmas). PCR products were quantitated using Gene ImagIR 3.56 (LI-COR). Expression of tested gene was normalized to that of NIPI-like protein (control 1) and Cmas (control 2) by using the formula (test/control 1 + test/control 2)/2. Real Time RT-PCR—Real time RT-PCR was done using ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system. Tead2 and Cmas primers are the same as these used in QMF-PCR. Primers for Vgl2 (NM_153786.1) are forward (5′-tcggtctggctgggtggtacag-3′) and reverse (5′-ccattcatcctagccacacaccg-3′). 0.5 μl of cDNA was used for RT-PCR in a 25-μl reaction with SYBR® green fluorescence labeling. PCR was done at 95 °C for 15 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles followed by a dissociation step to check the specificity of the products. Antibody Production, Western Blotting, and Immunostaining—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were produced against Tead2 using a single peptide showing no homology with other Tead family members (WTGSEEGSEEGTGGS). Immune sera were affinity-purified using the peptide. Antibody is available from the authors by request. Whole protein extraction from muscles was quantitated with Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 10 μg of proteins for each sample were loaded onto NuPAGE® Novex Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with Tead2 antibodies for 2 h and then with horseradish peroxidase-bovine-anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) for 1 h. Samples were detected with ECL Western-blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. Immunostaining was done as previously described (28Chen Y.W. Zhao P. Borup R. Hoffman E.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1321-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). R-phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 monoclonal antibodies (1:40 dilution) were purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Rat anti-mouse laminin α2 monoclonal antibodies (1:50 dilution) were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibodies against embryonic myosin heavy chain were obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. Secondary antibodies Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution), and Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:100 dilution) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Quantitation of anti-CD16/CD32 fluorescence was done using Image-Pro® Plus imaging software (Media Cybernetics). Muscle areas were measured using ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Fluorescence was normalized to the area of each muscle. Mineral Analysis—Injected muscles were cryo-sectioned and either stained by the von Kossa technique to demonstrate the presence of phosphate containing mineral or placed on barium fluoride spectroscopic windows and analyzed by Fourier transform infrared imaging (29Mendelsohn R. Paschalis E.P. Boskey A.L. J. Biomed. Opt. 1999; 4: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Spotlight Imaging system. The spatial resolution was ∼7 μm. Individual spectra were extracted from the images where mineral was visible (based on the increased intensity of the phosphate band at 900–1200 wave numbers) and compared with spectra of bone. PCR Amplification of the Fgfr4 Promoter, Tead2 First Intron, Subcloning, and Mutagenesis—A 226-bp Fgfr4 genomic region containing the M-CAT site was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA isolated from C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An MluI site was added to the forward primers, and an XhoI site was added to the reverse primers. Primer sequences are- forward (5′-cagtacgcgtaacgactgagactgggcgatcc-3′) and reverse (5′-tagtctcgagacactcacccgcccggagctc-3′). After PCR amplification, the Fgfr4 genomic products were first subcloned into pCR-II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then digested with MluI and XhoI. The Fgfr4-restricted fragments were subcloned in the pGL2 luciferase reporter vectors pGL2-Basic and pGL2-Promoter (Promega) digested with MluI and XhoI. Six consecutive point mutations were introduced in the M-CAT site (CATTCCT to CCGGAAA) of the FGFR4 promoter using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Both the wild-type sequence and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the Fgfr4 constructs. A 213-bp Tead2 first intron region containing two E-boxes was amplified from C2C12 cell genomic DNA. A KpnI site was added to the forward primers, and an XhoI site was added to the reverse primers. Primer sequences are 5′-tcagggtaccatgcccccttttgctgtgtcg-3′ (forward) and 5′-agtcctcgagagtgcctgaggctgtgtttgg-3′ (reverse). PCR products were digested with KpnI and XhoI and subcloned into pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega). Point mutations were introduced in the E-boxes (CAGCTGCTGCCCTTCTCTGAGCACCTG to CAGCGACTGCCCTTCTCTGAGTCCCTG) using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Both wild-type and mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells, Transfections, and Luciferase Assay—C2C12 skeletal muscle cells (ATCC) were cultured in growth medium (GM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). To induce differentiation, cells were switched to differentiation medium (DM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum and 1× insulin, transferrin, and selenium) 24 h after transfection and cultured for an additional 48 h. C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts (ATCC) were cultured in GM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were switched to DM and allowed to differentiate for 48 h. The pcDNA-mETF expression vector encoding mouse Tead2 was kindly provided by Dr. Hiroaki Ohkubo (Kumamoto University, Japan) (30Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), and luciferase activity was assayed with luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) on the microtiter luminescence detection system (MLX, Dynex, and Centro LB 9600, Berthold). Luciferase assays were done in triplicate points and repeated three times. Transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfection of green fluorescent protein. Gel Shift Assay—Twenty-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing potential MyoD binding sites in the first intron of Tead2 gene were used for MyoD gel shift assay. The sequences on the plus strand are Tead2 E1 (5′-tctccagcagctgctgccct 3′) and Tead2 E2 (5′-ctctgagcacctgttctttc-3′). A 21-bp MyoD binding probe from muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter (Geneka Biotech) was used as a control. The oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and purified with MicroSpin™ G25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Gel shift assay was done using a MyoD gel shift kit (Geneka Biotech). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) from C2C12 cells were incubated with binding buffer for 20 min at 4 °C and then incubated with 5 ng of labeled oligonucleotide probes for an additional 20 min at 4 °C. For the competition test, 100 times more of unlabeled wild-type or mutant MCK probes (500 ng) were added to each reaction. The reaction mixture was subjected to 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 90 V for 2.5 h. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—Murine myoblasts (C2C12) were cultured in 15-cm plates in 10% fetal bovine serum to 75% confluency. To induce differentiation, serum was withdrawn, and cells were allowed to differentiate for 2 days. Cells were fixed with 1% of formaldehyde to cross-link protein and DNA. Cells were then harvested, and chromatin was extracted. Chromatin was sonicated to 200–600-bp fragments. Chromatin fragments were precleared with protein A (Invitrogen) and then incubated with MyoD antibodies (M318X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Chromatin bound by antibodies was then precipitated with protein A, washed as described previously (25Zhao P. Iezzi S. Carver E. Dressman D. Gridley T. Sartorelli V. Hoffman E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30091-30101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and eluted with 50 mm NaHCO3 and 1% SDS. Protein and DNA cross-linking was reversed by incubating at 67 °C in 0.3 m NaCl for 5 h. DNA was then ethanol-precipitated, digested with proteinase K, and extracted with phenol/chloroform. Primers were designed to amplify candidate promoter sequences and were: Tead2 forward (5′-ttgtccctggatctctctgtccc-3′ and reverse (5′-atggggttgaagccacctgacc-3′); Gapdh forward (5′-cagcatagagcaggtggaccatg-3′) and reverse (5′-tcagcccactctccagaagc-3′); Rapsn (receptor-associated protein of the synapse) forward (5′-tcagaagtgtcaaaggggacacc-3′ and reverse (5′-caccctgggaacaaggctggttc-3′. Real time PCR was performed using Stratagene Mx3000P system and ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system. Fgfr4-/- Mice Show Abnormal Muscle Regeneration—To investigate the role of Fgfr4 in muscle regeneration, we induced staged degeneration/regeneration in gastrocnemii muscles in Fgfr4-/- mice and controls using cardiotoxin as we have previously described (17Zhao P. Hoffman E.P. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Zhao P. Iezzi S. Carver E. Dressman D. Gridley T. Sartorelli V. Hoffman E.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 326: 1049-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Six muscles at each time point of 0, 3, 4, 7, and 14 days post-injection were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin for both Fgfr4 null and normal controls, with three muscles in each group selected for more detailed study. The Fgfr4 null mice have an insertion of the NEO gene in exon 6 and have been reported to lack mRNA and protein (21Weinstein M. Xu X. Ohyama K. Deng C.X. Development. 1998; 125: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR was done at day 3 of regeneration in both wild-type and Fgfr4 null muscles, with primer sets to amplify both exons 5–7 and 5–8. Wild-type muscle showed the expected RT-PCR products, whereas the Fgfr4 null muscles showed an absence of these products (data not shown). This confirmed both the loss-of-function mutation of the Fgfr4 strains used and the expression of the Fgfr4 gene at the 3 day time point, as we have previously reported (17Zhao P. Hoffman E.P. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hematoxylin and eosin histopathology showed similar staining patterns in both Fgfr4-/- and controls at days 0, 3, and 4 (data not shown). However, by day 7 there were clear distinctions between Fgfr4 null and wild-type mice by immunostaining with embryonic myosin heavy chain antibodies (Fig. 1). Wild-type muscle showed maturing myofibers of relatively homogeneous size, central nuclei, and moderate staining with embryonic myosin heavy chain. Fgfr4 null mice showed considerable variability in myofiber size, with many small and intensely staining myofibers, suggesting a lag in the timing of regeneration. There were also very small fibers that stained intensely positive for embryonic myosin heavy chain, yet appeared to lack internal nuclei (Fig. 1). By 14 days, wild-type muscle showed characteristic large, closely packed regenerated myofibers with central nuclei (Fig. 2A). Fgfr4 null mice showed a highly variable histopathology, with some areas showing regenerated myofibers of variable size with larger nuclei (Fig. 2B). Other areas showed extensive calcifications by the von Kossa technique (Fig. 2C) and others, adipose tissue (Fig. 2D). Calcifications and adipocytes were not seen in any area of the wild-type regenerated mice. Inflammation, calcification, and fat infiltration were quantified. Inflammation was characterized by staining of muscle sections with phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies against CD16/CD32, which are expressed on a variety of inflammatory cells including natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, mast cells, B lymphocytes, immature thymocytes, and some activated mature T lymphocytes. Fgfr4 null mice showed 2–3 times more CD16/CD32+ cells relative to the total muscle area than wild-type mice (Fig. 2E). Fgfr4 null muscle showed large numbers of calcifications (three representative fields of three Fgfr4 null mouse muscles), with an average of 60 calcified foci per 10× field (Fig. 2F). Fgfr4 null mice also showed 8–30% of the muscle area replaced by adipocytes, whereas no adipocytes were seen in wild-type muscle (Fig. 2G) The calcifications were particularly striking in size and number. Chronic degeneration/regeneration in muscle can lead to foci of calcification, presumably due to poor clearance of macrophages. However, the large number and size of the calcifications suggested that these may be bone-like. To test this, we analyzed the mineral composition of the muscle using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (31Boskey A. Mendelsohn R. J. Biomed. Opt. 2005; 10: 031102Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We compared the infrared spectra from normal murine muscle (Fig. 3A), Fgfr4 null muscle 14 days after injection with cardiotoxin (Fig. 3B), and normal murine bone (Fig. 3C). The mineral peaks at ∼900–1200 cm-1 in the injected Fgfr4-/- muscle are comparable with normal bone, indicating that hydroxyapatite is present. The increased intensity of the mineral relative to the amide I peak in the injected specimen (Fig. 3B) in contrast to the bone demonstrates that the calcifications are not truly bone-like because the ratio of mineral to collagen differs (either less collagen or more mineral) but have similar components. Taken together, these data show that Fgfr4-deficient muscle regenerates abnormally, with poorly timed regeneration after day 4 (myotube formation). Activators of Fgfr4; Identification of Tead as a Candidate—To determine transcriptional activators for Fgfr4 relevant to myogenesis, we obtained mouse Fgfr4 (NM_008011) promoter sequence from Genome Browser (genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) and queried the promoter region (600 bp) and first intron of the Fgfr4 genomic sequence for potential transcriptional factor binding sites using the Transcription Element Search System (TESS, www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess). We identified an M-CAT motif (CATTCCT) 49 bp from the transcription start site of mouse Fgfr4. This M-CAT motif is conserved in human FGFR4. The M-CAT motif has been found in promoters of muscle-specific genes and has been shown to be bound by TEA domain proteins (Tead) proteins. To determine which Tead isoform (gene) was a possible regulator of Fgfr4, we queried our previously reported 27-time point muscle regeneration expression profiling series for all Tead transcripts (17Zhao P. Hoffman E.P. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Zhao P. Iezzi S. Carver E. Dressman D. Gridley T. Sartorelli V. Hoffman E.P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1969992151,"The acquisition of neuronal type-specific morphogenesis is a central feature of neuronal differentiation and has important consequences for region-specific nervous system functions. Here, we report that the cell type-specific cholesterol profile determines the differential modulation of axon and dendrite outgrowths in hippocampal and cerebral cortical neurons in culture. The extent of axon and dendrite outgrowths is greater and the polarity formation occurs earlier in cortical neurons than in hippocampal neurons. The cholesterol concentrations in total homogenate and the lipid rafts from hippocampal neurons are significantly higher than those from cortical neurons. Cholesterol depletion by β-cyclodextrin markedly enhanced the neurite outgrowth and accelerated the establishment of neuronal polarity in hippocampal neurons, which were similarly observed in nontreated cortical neurons, whereas cholesterol loading had no effects. In contrast, both depletion and loading of cholesterol decreased the neurite outgrowths in cortical neurons. The stimulation of neurite outgrowth and polarity formation induced by cholesterol depletion was accompanied by an enhanced localization of Fyn, a Src kinase, in the lipid rafts of hippocampal neurons. A concomitant treatment with β-cyclodextrin and a Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, specifically blocked axon outgrowth but not dendrite outgrowth (both of which were enhanced by β-cyclodextrin) in hippocampal neurons, suggesting that axon outgrowth modulated by cholesterol is induced in a Fyn-dependent manner. These results suggest that cellular cholesterol modulates axon and dendrite outgrowths and neuronal polarization under culture conditions and also that the difference in cholesterol profile between hippocampal and cortical neurons underlies the difference in neurite outgrowth between these two types of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2019002699,"The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor (ERR) α is a downstream effector of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α in the regulation of genes important for mitochondrial oxidative capacity. PGC-1α is also a potent activator of the transcriptional program required for hepatic gluconeogenesis, and in particular of the key gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). We report here that the regulatory sequences of the PEPCK gene harbor a functional ERRα binding site. However, in contrast to the co-stimulating effects of ERRα and PGC-1α on mitochondrial gene expression, ERRα acts as a transcriptional repressor of the PEPCK gene. Suppression of ERRα expression by small interfering RNA leads to reduced binding of ERRα to the endogenous PEPCK gene, and an increase in promoter occupancy by PGC-1α, suggesting that part of the ERRα function at this gene is to antagonize the action of PGC-1α. In agreement with the in vitro studies, animals that lack ERRα show increased expression of gluconeogenic genes, including PEPCK and glycerol kinase, but decreased expression of mitochondrial genes, such as ATP synthase subunit β and cytochrome c-1. Our findings suggest that ERRα has opposing effects on genes important for mitochondrial oxidative capacity and gluconeogenesis.

Importantly, increased expression of PGC-1α in the liver of fed animals is sufficient to inappropriately induce gluconeogenic enzymes and elevate blood glucose levels, a finding that underscores the possible involvement of this coactivator in the elevation of hepatic glucose production in the diabetic state (26Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Whereas a positive role of ERRα in PGC-1α-induced expression of mitochondrial genes has been established, the role of ERRα in the regulation of genes involved in hepatic glucose metabolism, including PGC-1α-stimulated gluconeogenesis, is not clear. ERRα is induced in the liver in response to fasting, but has been proposed to either be a repressor of general PGC-1α transcriptional activity (12Ichida M. Nemoto S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50991-50995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or to have no effect on gluconeogenic enzymes (17Mootha V.K. Handschin C. Arlow D. Xie X.

A. 2004; 101: 6570-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Notably, the PEPCK gene promoter contains a sequence that resembles an ERRE and that overlaps with a site (glucocorticoid accessory factor 3 (gAF3)) critical for the activation of PEPCK transcription by PGC-1α (45Herzog B. Hall R.K. Wang X.L. Waltner-Law M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we address in vitro and in vivo the role of ERRα in the regulation of PEPCK gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that ERRα inhibits PEPCK gene expression, at least in part by restricting the interaction of PGC-1α with the PEPCK promoter. Furthermore, the repressive effect of ERRα is specific for gluconeogenic genes, whereas genes involved in mitochondrial respiratory function are activated by hepatic ERRα. The potential benefits of an ERRα role in reducing hepatic glucose production while increasing oxidative capacity are discussed. Animals—Generation of ERRα null mice in the C57BL/6 background has been described elsewhere (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.A. Richard D. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Mice were housed at 21 °C on a 12-h light-dark cycle and fed ad libitum with a standard diet containing 5% fat (Harland Tekland LM-485, Indianapolis, IN). For gene expression analysis, adult (8–10 weeks) ERRα null females and wild type littermates were fasted for 24 h and then fed for 5 h with standard diet. After the refeeding period, mice were euthanized, and tissues were removed and stored for subsequent analysis. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines for animal care and use of The Scripps Research Institute.

https://openalex.org/W2114705741,"In human erythrocytes, infection by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum or oxidative stress induces a new organic osmolyte and anion permeability. To examine a role for autocrine purinoceptor signaling during this induction process, erythrocytic purinoceptor expression, and ATP release were determined. Furthermore, using pharmacological and genetic approaches the dependence on purinoceptor signaling of osmolyte permeability and Plasmodium development, both in vitro and in vivo, were assessed. Extracellular ATP did not induce an osmolyte permeability in non-infected or non-oxidized erythrocytes. ATP and other purinoceptor agonists increased the induction of osmolyte permeability during infection or oxidation as measured by isosmotic hemolysis and patch-clamp recording. Purinoceptor antagonists and apyrase decreased the induced permeability. The observed pharmacology suggested the involvement of P2Y purinoceptors. Accordingly, human erythrocytes expressed P2Y1 protein. Moreover, P2Y1-deficient mouse erythrocytes exhibited a delayed appearance of the osmolyte permeability during P. berghei infection- or oxidation compared with wild-type erythrocytes. Furthermore, the nonspecific purinoceptor antagonist suramin decreased in vitro growth and DNA/RNA amplification of P. falciparum in human erythrocytes and decreased in vivo growth of P. berghei. P. berghei developed slower in P2Y1-deficient mice in vivo compared with wild-type animals. In conclusion, induction of the osmolyte permeability in Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes involves autocrine purinoceptor signaling."

The pathological hallmarks of AD include extracellular deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP695) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of intracellular bundles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein bound into paired helical filaments (1Selkoe D.J.

Dense-cored plaques are associated with dystrophic neurites and an inflammatory response accompanied by microglial activation. We report here the novel and unexpected discovery of large creatine (Cr) deposits in the hippocampi and cortex of transgenic AD mice and in post-mortem sections of human AD hippocampus. The creatine-phosphocreatine system plays a key role in energy metabolism in tissues such as neurons with high energy demand (9Wyss M. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1107-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Phosphocreatine (PCr), synthesized from Cr and ATP in the mitochondria (site of ATP synthesis), is used to regenerate ATP in the cytosol (site of ATP use) by the mitochondrial and cytosolic isozymes of creatine kinase (CK), respectively, thus helping to maintain ATP homeostasis: Cr + ATP ↔ PCr + ADP + H+. CK is very sensitive to oxidative stress and appears to be one of the specific targets of post-translational oxidative modification in AD brain tissue (10Castegna A. Aksenov M. Aksenova M.

Cultured neurons exposed to Aβ exhibit oxidative stress, including increase in protein carbonyl formation and a decline in CK activity (13Aksenov M.Y. Aksenova M.V. Markesbery W.R. Butterfield D.A.

Neurochem. 2002; 80: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Following our initial identification of Cr deposits in small IR maps of brain tissue from the four 47-week-old and one 21-week-old TgCRND8, we mapped the complete hippocampus in sections from sixteen animals (Tg and non-Tg littermates from two different mouse lines expressing the same double mutant form of APP695) and discovered extensive Cr load in all Tg mice. Large deposits of Cr were also identified in hippocampal sections from post-mortem AD human brain. These deposits are absent or significantly lower in age-matched control mice and in non-demented post-mortem human hippocampus; thus we speculate that their presence is an important and hitherto unsuspected marker of the disease process. Transgenic Mice—In the first study, Tg(K670N/M671L+V717F)8 (C3H/C57) mice and non-transgenic littermates were sacrificed at 21 weeks (three TgCRND8 and five non-Tg) and at 47 weeks (four TgCRND8 and four non-Tg). Following the detection of Cr in the transgenics, an additional 16 mice, aged 34–89 weeks, were examined. This set included six pairs of TgCRND8 and non-Tg littermates, as well as two pairs of Tg(K670N/M671L+V717F)19959 and their non-Tg littermates. This independent Tg19959 line derives from the same transgene construct as TgCRND8 (APP695, K670N/M671L+V717F) and has similar levels of APP holoprotein expression and associated pathology but is maintained on a different genetic background (129SvEv/Tac). All animals were bred at the Center for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases. Tissue Preparation—Animals were killed by cervical dislocation; brains were removed and bisected at the midline. The left half of the brain was covered in OCT medium and frozen on dry ice; the right half was placed in cold 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline for fixation, then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. For general examination of tissue pathology prior to data collection, paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, modified Bielschowsky silver stain, and Congo red. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to tau and ubiquitin was also performed. The animals were treated in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, and the protocols were approved by the University of Toronto and University of Manitoba. For infrared and Raman microspectroscopy, the unfixed, flash-frozen tissues were cryosectioned at 8 μm thickness and mounted on either IR reflective slides (Low-e MirrIR™, Kevley Technologies, Chesterland, OH) or gold-coated silicon chips, fabricated in-house at the Synchrotron Radiation Center. Post-mortem Human Autopsy Tissue—In a pilot study, anonymized samples of hippocampus were acquired prospectively from hospital autopsies at the Health Sciences Center (Winnipeg, Canada) within the scope of the autopsy permission forms and the Autopsy Act. The study was approved by the tissue access committee. Initial assessments (two AD and two non-demented) were made from the available information: age, history of dementia or other neurological disease including seizures, and interval between death and autopsy. After dissection of the temporal lobe to expose the hippocampus, multiple coronal slices (3–4-mm-thick) were obtained by sharp dissection, frozen immediately by immersion of the sealed container in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. The remaining brain was fixed by immersion in 10% buffered formalin for 10–14 days, then samples of the contralateral and remaining ipsilateral hippocampus, lateral frontal cortex, and middle temporal gyrus, as well as other brain regions, were obtained and embedded in paraffin. The sections were stained with the modified Bielschowsky method, and Congo red, to diagnose Alzheimer disease according to the NIA-Reagan criteria (16The National Institute on Aging and Reagan Institute Working Group on Diagnostic Criteria for the Neuropathological Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: S1-S2Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Both the plaque scores and the NFT percentages were considered in this classification. Following identification of acceptable normal and disease cases, frozen hippocampus sections were warmed to about –30 °C, sectioned for microspectroscopy as above, and air-dried. IR Microspectroscopy—All spectra were collected in reflectance mode from 4000–700 cm–1 at 4 cm–1 resolution with Happ-Genzel apodization and saved in log(1/R) format; thus these are raw data without any other postprocessing. Synchrotron data were recorded on a Nicolet Magna 500 FTIR with Nic-Plan IR microscope (Synchrotron Radiation Center, University of Wisconsin) or a Nicolet Magna 860 FTIR with Spectra Tech Continuum IR microscope (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories). Maps were analyzed with OMNIC/Atlμs software (ThermoNicolet). Additional survey maps were acquired on a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR with Bruker Hyperion microscope (in-house) and analyzed with CytoSpec software (17Lasch P. Haensch W. Naumann D. Diem M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1688: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Pixel size in IR maps was 6 × 6 μm2 (National Synchrotron Light Source), 10 × 10 μm2 (Synchrotron Radiation Center), or 20 × 20 μm2 (in-house). IR Spectral Analysis—IR spectroscopy can be used to study protein aggregation, since the position of the amide I band is dependent on the secondary structure of the protein (7Gough K.M. Rak M. Bookatz A. Del Bigio M. Mai S. Westaway D. Vib. Spectrosc. 2005; 38: 133-141Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Gough K.M. Zelinski D. Wiens R. Rak M. Dixon I.M.C Anal.

Plaques were identified by the presence of a low frequency absorption (1635 cm–1) in the amide I band (7Gough K.M. Rak M. Bookatz A. Del Bigio M. Mai S. Westaway D. Vib. Spectrosc. 2005; 38: 133-141Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Reference spectra of pure Cr (Sigma) were recorded in reflectance mode on MirrIR slides. Raman Microspectroscopy—Spectra of the crystalline inclusions in TgCRND8 mouse brain and human AD brain sections, and of pure Cr (Sigma) mounted on gold-coated silicon chips, were recorded with a Renishaw Raman microscope (Saskatchewan Structural Sciences Centre, University of Saskatchewan); illuminated with 5 milliwatts of 785-nm light, at one-micron spatial resolution and 4 cm–1 spectral resolution. Paraffin-embedded sections from the brains of the TgCRND8 mice and non-transgenic littermate controls were first evaluated by histochemistry and immunohistochemistry (data not shown). No neurofibrillary tangles were apparent in either silver-stained or tau-immunostained sections. Subjectively, in the 21- and 47-week-old transgenic mice, plaques were most abundant in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, and hippocampus, slightly less abundant in the striatum and thalamus, and rare in the olfactory bulb, brainstem, and cerebellum. We found plaques in all seven TgCRND8 mice and none in the controls. We discovered spectral anomalies atypical of both normal and plaque tissue in several IR maps of TgCRND8 brain (Fig. 1A). The sharp spectral bands (Fig. 1A, red) indicated a high degree of order in the material, suggesting a crystalline nature. An IR spectral data base search targeted Cr as a candidate; we confirmed this identity by IR spectroscopy of pure Cr (Fig. 1A, green). The spectrum of the crystalline inclusion embedded in the tissue is readily seen to exhibit all the characteristic peaks of pure Cr, superimposed on the spectrum of normal tissue (Fig. 1A, blue). The identity was confirmed by Raman microspectroscopy of crystalline inclusions in human AD and TgCRND8 hippocampus, which are compared with the Raman spectrum of pure Cr in Fig. 1B. Given the specificity of the number, position, and relative intensity of the spectral bands in these samples, no other assignment is possible. Moreover, there is no evidence of the PCr form, as typical phosphate bands are absent. For Cr detection in the IR maps, we used the integrated intensity of the sharp band appearing at 1304 cm–1, since it lies in a region that is relatively free of interfering bands in normal tissue and can be readily identified. For each pixel that tested positive, the entire spectrum was reviewed to confirm that it was a complete match. Subsequent re-examination of all maps revealed some intriguing results. Numerous deposits were identified in the cortex of one of the 21-week-old TgCRND8 mice (Fig. 2, A–C). Cr deposits were discovered in the caudate, cortex, and hippocampus of all four of the 47-week-old TgCRND8 mice. About one-third of these were intimately associated with plaques (Fig. 2, D–I); the remainder occurred as isolated microdeposits (10–20 μm diameter). One crystal was found beside one of the rare dense-cored plaques in the caudate of a 47-week-old TgCRND8. No such deposits were identified in any of the maps from the nine control samples (21 and 47 weeks) or in the other two 21-week-old TgCRND8 animals. To better evaluate this anomalous Cr presence and its association with the transgenic mice, we conducted a second series of studies. These were expanded to include analysis of the entire hippocampal region in six pairs of TgCRND8 and non-Tg littermates and two pairs from a second Tg line, Tg19959 (8Chishti M.A. Yang D. Janus C. Phinney A.L. Horne P. Pearson J. Strome R. Zuker N. Loukides J. French J. Turner S. Lozza G. Grilli M. Kunicki S. Morissette C. Paquette J. Gervais F. Bergeron C. Fraser P.E. Carlson G.A. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21562-21570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The IR signature of Cr was detected in the hippocampus of every Tg mouse, from both lines. No Cr was detected in the young non-transgenic TgCRND8 littermates; a small deposit was identified in three of four controls sacrificed after 15 months. Cr was detected throughout the 34-week-old Tg19959 brain (Fig. 3, A and B), while none could be detected in the non-Tg littermate brain (Fig. 3, C and D). A few pixels (6 of 3724) were positive for Cr in the 38-week-old non-Tg brain. In 72-week-old TgCRND8 mice, one Cr deposit was found spreading across an area of 400 × 60 μm in the stratum radiatum, along with numerous smaller deposits scattered throughout the hippocampus (Fig. 3, E and F). A small deposit of Cr was detected around the CA2 of the 72-week-old (Fig. 3G,H) and 89-week-old non-Tg animals. Finally, we surveyed hippocampal sections from human brain (two AD and two non-demented). The human hippocampus is far larger than the mouse; thus only portions of the brain were surveyed, representative of CA1–4, molecular layer, and dentate gyrus. The IR signature of Cr was detected in sections from all brains, but the occurrence and intensity of the signal were greater in the hippocampus of an advanced AD brain. Representative maps of the CA1 show strong Cr signals detected in 8% of pixels in a CA1 map (Fig. 4, A and B) and only traces in the non-demented (Fig. 4, C and D). Since the intensity of the IR signal is directly proportional to the amount present, we can state with confidence that the amount of Cr present in these AD hippocampus sections was elevated in a manner that was very similar to that found in the Tg mouse model. Creatine is a normal component of brain tissue with an estimated average concentration of 12 μm/g wet weight in mouse brain (21Ipsiroglu O.S. Stromberger C. Ilas J. Hoger H. Muhl A. Stockler-Ipsiroglu S. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 1805-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Cr-PCr system plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, maintaining ATP homeostasis through the enzymatic additional or removal of phosphate (9Wyss M. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1107-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). The fact that the spectra correspond to Cr and not PCr is reasonable, since all PCr would be depleted at death, leaving Cr as the only existing form. While there is no obvious reason for Cr to be deposited in the AD brains, it is important to note that reduced brain metabolism is almost always associated with AD and other forms of dementia (3Blass J. Gibson G.E. Hoyer S. J. Alzheimer Dis. 2002; 4: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CK has been identified as a target of post-translational oxidative modification in AD brain tissue (10Castegna A. Aksenov M. Aksenova M. Thongboonkerd V. Klein J.B. Pierce W.M. Booze R. Markesbery W.R. Butterfield D.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 562-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). As an antioxidant with a crucial role in energy metabolism, Cr has been suggested as a potential therapy for AD (9Wyss M. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1107-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 22Tarnopolsky M.A. Beal F.M. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 561-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 23Wyss M. Schulze A. Neuroscience. 2002; 112: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the analysis of neural cell cultures has shown that Cr concentration in oligodendrocytes and cortical astrocytes is greater than in neurons (24Urenjak J. Williams S.R. Gadian D.G. Noble M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 981-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dringen R. Verleysdonk S. Hamprecht B. Willker W. Leibfritz D. Brand A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The TgCRND8 mouse brain showed an inflammatory response accompanied by microglial activation (8Chishti M.A. Yang D. Janus C. Phinney A.L. Horne P. Pearson J. Strome R. Zuker N. Loukides J. French J. Turner S. Lozza G. Grilli M. Kunicki S. Morissette C. Paquette J. Gervais F. Bergeron C. Fraser P.E. Carlson G.A.

The FTIR detection method employed here is critical to our discovery. These small, soluble deposits would be removed by the repetitive solvent treatments and washes employed in standard staining procedures. Under our protocols, the frozen, unfixed tissue is cryosectioned, and the mounted sections are desiccated in air. Thus, the content of the sample is unaltered in that nothing has been added or taken away (except water). We note that there is no likelihood of contamination: tissues from control and AD brain were processed at the same time. The same result was obtained when sections from Tg and non-Tg mouse brain were mounted on different substrates (MirrIR and gold-coated silicon). We have used animals from two different lines such that the doubly mutant APP695 is maintained on different genetic backgrounds. The only occurrences of Cr in a non-Tg mouse brain were relatively minor deposits, found in the extremely aged animals (89 and 72 weeks, Fig. 3G,H), and traces in the 38-week-old non-Tg19959 littermate brain. This indicates a gradual, age-dependent increase in oxidative stress. The distribution in the human tissue is similar to that in the Tg mouse; it is sometimes associated with a plaque but frequently is widespread randomly across the tissue areas. In magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), the Cr/PCr signal has been used extensively as an internal standard relative to which the concentrations of other components (e.g. N-acetylaspartate, choline, myo-inositol, and glutamate-glutamine complex) have been estimated (26Valenzuela M.J. Sachdev P. Neurology. 2001; 56: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, a quantitative analysis reported elevated levels of Cr in the gray and white matter of elderly and AD patients compared with young controls (27Pfefferbaum A. Adalsteinson E. Spielman D. Sullivan E.V. Lim K.O. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1999; 56: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In vivo (28Stoppe G. Bruhn H. Pouwels P.W.J Hanicke W. Frahm J. Alzheimer Dis. Assoc. Disord. 2000; 14: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and ex vivo (29Mohanakrishnan P. Fowler A.H. Vonsatell J.P. Jolles P.R. Husain M.M. Liem P. Myers L. Komoroski R.A. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 1998; 52: B111-B117Google Scholar) MRS studies pointed out the strong heterogeneity of the elderly subjects and could not conclusively differentiate between AD and aged matched controls based on the Cr content. However, a 1–2 mm elevation of Cr was found in the five most severe AD cases in an in vivo study (30Huang W. Alexander G.E. Chang L. Shetty H.U. Krasuski J.S. Rapoport S.I. Schapiro M.B. Neurology. 2001; 57: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) of 21 AD patients and 17 age-matched controls. Voxels were 2.0 × 2.0 ×2.0 cm3. We have found varying amounts of Cr in the human autopsy samples, but the small sample size precludes any detailed conclusions on its relationship to the disease evolution. Cr is likely an indicator of oxidative stress and thus may be associated with many different conditions in humans. The extensive microdeposits of Cr found in the Tg mice and the small localized deposits found in the hippocampus of our most aged control mice mirror the results from the MRS studies. The spatial resolution of MRS experiments is insufficient to detect the localized nature of the deposits found here; relative concentration estimates are frequently based on the assumption that the average Cr concentration is constant. The striking and unexpected discovery reported here casts doubt on this assumption and bears further detailed investigation. Many other intriguing questions are raised by this discovery, including the form and micro-localization of the Cr in vivo and the possible disease-associated pathways that control this accumulation.

https://openalex.org/W1999650655,"We describe here the use of cysteine substitution mutants in the Alzheimer disease amyloid plaque peptide Aβ-(1-40) to probe amyloid fibril structure and stabilization. In one approach, amyloid fibrils were grown from Cys mutant peptides under reducing conditions and then challenged with an alkylating agent to probe solvent accessibility of different residues in the fibril. In another approach, monomeric Cys mutants, either in the thiol form or modified with iodoacetic acid or methyl iodide, were grown into amyloid fibrils, and the equilibrium position at the end of the amyloid formation reaction was quantified by determining the concentration of monomeric Aβ. The ΔG values of fibril elongation obtained were then compared in order to provide information on the environment of each residue side chain in the fibril. In general, Cys residues in the N and C termini of Aβ-(1-40) were not only accessible to alkylation in the fibril state but also, when modified in the monomeric state, did not greatly impact fibril stability; these observations were consistent with previous indications that these portions of the peptide are not part of the amyloid core. In contrast, residues 16-19 and 31-34 were not only uniformly inaccessible to alkylation in the fibril state, but their modification with the negatively charged carboxymethyl group in monomeric Aβ also destabilized fibril elongation, confirming other data showing that these segments are likely packed into a hydrophobic amyloid core. Residues 20, 30, and 35, flanking these implicated β-sandwich regions, are accessible to alkylation in the fibril indicating a location in solvent exposed structure.

Amyloid fibrils and other non-native protein aggregates are now regarded as an important alternate universe of protein structures formed by normal proteins exposed to conditions of environmental or mutational stress. Fibrils, protofibrils, and other aggregates are associated with a variety of serious human diseases of the brain (1Martin J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and periphery (2Merlini G. Bellotti V. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Aggregate formation has also long been recognized as a major technical problem in the industrial production and use of proteins (3Wetzel R. Goeddel D.V. Meienhofer J. Gross E. The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. 5. Academic Press, New York1983: 1-64Google Scholar, 4Kane J.F. Hartley D.L. Bioprocess. Technol. (N.

The intrinsic tendency of polypeptide polymers to generate off-pathway aggregates can be viewed as a design flaw in the structural biology of the cell. Since up to 50% of newly synthesized protein chains are aggregated and/or misfolded (7Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. Science. 2000; 289: 2117-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that major biochemical pathways have evolved in cells and organisms to manage the misfolding and aggregation processes, as exemplified by the chaperone (8Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar), ubiquitin-proteasome (9Vigouroux S. Briand M. Briand Y. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) systems. In at least a few cases, nature has exploited the ability of polypeptide chains to form amyloid by evolving specific polypeptide sequences and the required cellular machinery for developing functional amyloids, for example as a means of cell attachment (13Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) or gene regulation (14True H.L. Lindquist S.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Given the growing importance of non-native protein aggregates, it is desirable to gain an increased knowledge of their structures and how these structures might differ from those of typical globular proteins. Protein aggregates are not amenable to standard methods of structure determination, however, being too large and heterodisperse for solution phase NMR or x-ray crystallography. The inability of conventional methods to extract many details of aggregate structure has led to a search for alternative approaches. Some of these methods, such as those described here, prove to be derivatives of methods previously used to dissect the structures of globular proteins before structure determination by x-ray crystallography and solution phase NMR became routine. The non-native aggregate most amenable to structural analysis is the amyloid fibril, and the most widely studied amyloid fibrils are those of the Alzheimer plaque peptide Aβ, 2The abbreviations used are: Aβamyloid-βThTthioflavin TTCEPTris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphinePBSphosphate-buffered salinePBSAPBS containing 0.05% sodium azideHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyRP-HPLCreverse-phase-HPLCWTwild typeMSmass spectrometryEMelectron microscopy. 2The abbreviations used are: Aβamyloid-βThTthioflavin TTCEPTris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphinePBSphosphate-buffered salinePBSAPBS containing 0.05% sodium azideHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyRP-HPLCreverse-phase-HPLCWTwild typeMSmass spectrometryEMelectron microscopy. in particular the 1-40 form of the peptide. Like other amyloid fibrils, the Aβ-(1-40) fibril consists of a bundle of protofilaments (15Malinchik S.B. Inouye H. Szumowski K.E. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 537-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Like other amyloid fibrils, Aβ-(1-40) fibrils exhibit a cross-β pattern in x-ray fiber diffraction (15Malinchik S.B. Inouye H. Szumowski K.E. Kirschner D.A. Biophys.

Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although some amyloid fibrils, including fibrils of some Aβ fragments, appear to consist of an anti-parallel β-sheet arrangement (17Petkova A.T. Buntkowsky G. Dyda F. Leapman R.D. Yau W.M. Tycko R.

The problem of structural analysis of amyloid fibrils has been made even more complicated by the revelations of recent years that single amino acid sequences can form multiple conformational forms of amyloid fibrils (31Chien P. DePace A.H. Collins S.R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 424: 948-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S.

Science. 2005; 307: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). The structural bases of these conformational differences remain to be elaborated in full. Interestingly, perhaps the best characterized example of conformational variation is in amyloid fibrils of Aβ-(1-40). Fibrils grown under conditions of stirring (“agitated”) differ from fibrils grown without stirring (“quiescent”), both in their intramolecular architecture and in their EM morphology (33Petkova A.T. Leapman R.D. Guo Z. Yau W.M. Mattson M.P. Tycko R. Science. 2005; 307: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that some differences in published structural data on Aβ-(1-40) fibrils, such as among the studies cited above, can be attributed to real structural differences in the fibrils due to variations in fibril growth conditions. We describe here several uses of cysteine mutants of the Aβ-(1-40) sequence, on the one hand exploiting the unique chemical reactivity of the Cys sulfhydryl group to assess side chain accessibility in the fibril and on the other hand taking advantage of Cys reactivity to create multiple chemical mutants of Aβ-(1-40) that can be assessed for their relative abilities to make fibrils. The data provided new, unique information about the solvent accessibility of various residue positions in Aβ-(1-40) amyloid fibril grown under the physiological conditions of PBS buffer, 37 °C, and the absence of stirring or shaking. The data also provided additional information on the chemical environments within the fibril for the amino acid side chains at most residue positions. The data allowed us to further refine our understanding of amyloid structure in general and of one important conformer type of the Aβ-(1-40) fibril in particular. All the peptides used in this study were purchased from Keck Biotechnology Center at Yale University. WT Aβ-(1-40) (for amino acid sequence, see Fig. 1) was obtained as a pure peptide. Single cysteine replacement mutants of Aβ-(1-40) (for representation of which mutant peptides were obtained, see Fig. 1) were obtained unpurified. The mutant peptides were purified on Bio-Rad RP-HPLC using a semi-preparative C3 column and a water/acetonitrile gradient with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The identity and purity of the final peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry and analytical RP-HPLC on an Agilent 1100 series mass spectrometry detector. Bond breaker TCEP solution (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) was purchased from Pierce. Iodoacetic acid, iodoacetamide, and iodomethane were purchased from Sigma. Covalent Modification of Cys Sulfhydryl Group at the Monomer Level—The side chain sulfhydryl group of Cys in each of the mutant peptides was modified by treating the monomeric peptide with two different alkylating agents. For modification of the side chain, each purified mutant peptide at a concentration of 1-2 mg/ml was incubated in argon-purged 8 m urea buffer at 37 °C with either iodoacetic acid (10 mm; 20 min) or iodomethane (10 mm; 60 min) at pH 8.0. Reaction mixtures were immediately injected onto RP-HPLC and purified. Eluate fractions were pooled based on mass spectrometric analysis. The final purity of each pooled modified peptide was confirmed by analytical HPLC and covalent modification confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Amyloid Fibril Assembly—Fibril formation was carried out on both side chain-modified and -unmodified cysteine mutants. For the side chain-modified mutants, fibril growth was carried out using the standard protocol described (21Kheterpal I. Williams A. Murphy C. Bledsoe B. Wetzel R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 11757-11767Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 34O'Nuallain B. Thakur A.K. Williams A.D. Bhattacharyya A.M. Chen S. Thiagarajan G. Wetzel R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly disaggregated (34O'Nuallain B. Thakur A.K. Williams A.D. Bhattacharyya A.M. Chen S. Thiagarajan G. Wetzel R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chen S. Wetzel R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) peptide was incubated at 37 °C in PBS (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% sodium azide (PBSA) together with a seed consisting of 0.1 weight percentage of sonicated WT Aβ-(1-40) fibrils. For the unmodified cysteine mutants, the protocol was similar except that the PBSA buffer contained 10 mm TCEP plus 1 mm EDTA and was bubbled with argon gas prior to dissolving the freshly disaggregated peptide, to keep the sulfhydryl group of cysteine in the reduced state during fibril assembly. Fibril formation reactions for all mutants were seeded initially with 0.1 weight percentage of sonicated WT Aβ-(1-40) fibrils. (For some mutants, which exhibited a lag time of more than 15 days, we used 1% seed.) For most of the mutants, assembly reactions were carried out at starting concentrations of monomeric peptide of about 50 μm. For those peptides that did not aggregate at 50 μm concentration, a new fibril assembly reaction was initiated at a higher concentration, in the range of 100-200 μm. Progress of the reaction was monitored by ThT measurement of fibrils (36LeVine H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). When the ThT signal reached a plateau value, reaction progress was further monitored by HPLC, as described previously (21Kheterpal I. Williams A. Murphy C. Bledsoe B. Wetzel R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 11757-11767Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 34O'Nuallain B. Thakur A.K. Williams A.D. Bhattacharyya A.M. Chen S. Thiagarajan G. Wetzel R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), to determine the concentration of Aβ-(1-40) at equilibrium, the critical concentration (Cr) (34O'Nuallain B. Thakur A.K. Williams A.D. Bhattacharyya A.M. Chen S. Thiagarajan G. Wetzel R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 37O'Nuallain B. Shivaprasad S. Kheterpal I. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12709-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Equilibrium constants for fibril elongation derived from Cr values were used to calculate free energies using the relationship ΔG = -RTlnKeq. Modification of Sulfhydryl Group of Cys at the Fibril Level—Unmodified Cys mutant fibrils grown under reducing conditions were centrifuged at 85,000 rpm (315,000 × g) for 30 min to remove any soluble peptide. The pellet was then resuspended and incubated in the dark for 1 h with 10 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm Tris buffer at pH 8.0 at room temperature. Fibril products were collected by centrifugation (as above) and washed twice with PBS buffer to remove any dissociated monomer and unreacted alkylating agent. After the last wash, the centrifugation pellet was dissolved in 20% aqueous formic acid, injected on a Zorbax SB-C3 analytical HPLC column linked to an Agilent 1100 electrospray mass spectrometer, and eluted with an acetonitrile-aqueous 0.1% formic acid gradient (formic acid is used instead of the more standard trifluoroacetic acid to improve MS sensitivity). Eluent was passed through a UV detector set at 215 nm and an Agilent 1100 electrospray mass spectrometer. Using A215 peak area(s) for quantitation, Aβ-(1-40) recovery was typically 80% or better based on the amount of Aβ expected for the mass of fibrils used in the experiment (38Shivaprasad S. Wetzel R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For most analyses, the amount of Cys modification was quantified using the MS data. Using the Agilent software, the mass distribution data across the HPLC elution peak(s) corresponding to unmodified, singly modified, and multiply modified Aβ molecules were deconvoluted to generate the relative abundance of each species underneath the peak envelope. These relative abundances were used to calculate percentage of modification. In some cases, the unmodified and modified A215 peaks were sufficiently separated in the HPLC that the relative A215 peak areas could be used to calculate the percentage of modification. Since, however, for many Aβ mutants, the modified and unmodified peaks were not fully separated, it was necessary in these cases to use the deconvoluted MS data to determine the percentage of modification. Although this requires the assumption of equal MS sensitivity for the modified and unmodified peptides, this appears to be a valid assumption since there is good agreement with A215 peak areas in those cases in which analysis by both means is feasible (38Shivaprasad S. Wetzel R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Fibrils grown in PBS were adsorbed onto carbon- and Formvar-coated grids and negatively stained with 0.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. The stained grids after washing of the excess uranyl acetate were examined and photographed on a Hitachi-600 EM. Fig. 1 shows the Aβ-(1-40) sequence (a) and two published models of the Aβ-(1-40) amyloid fibril. The model in b was derived from a combination of scanning proline mutagenesis experiments (26Williams A.D. Portelius E. Kheterpal I. Guo J.T. Cook K.D. Xu Y. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and a threading approach applied to parallel β-helical domains of globular proteins (39Guo J.-T. Wetzel R. Xu Y. Proteins. 2004; 57: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The model in c was derived from solid state NMR measurements (40Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). Both models posit a basic unit of fibril structure in which the Aβ molecule folds into a loop composed of 2-3 elements of extended chain oriented in such a way that the amino acid side chains in these segments project either into the interior of the loop or out of the loop. In both models, the inward-projecting side chains form a densely packed interior (although perhaps not evident from the depiction in Fig. 1b, the interior of the model, like the interiors of all parallel β-helical domains (41Jenkins J. Pickersgill R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 111-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 42Wetzel R. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1031-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), is densely filled with side chain mass). Both models also presume that some of the outward-projecting side chains will also be packed into similar, adjacent elements to build up the lateral packing required to form fibrils from protofilaments. Importantly, neither published model addresses the orientation of these extended chains, that is, whether particular amino acid side chains in these segments are inward- or outward-projecting. Our Cys accessibility studies were designed to address this issue, as well as the environments of other Aβ amino acid side chains in the fibril. We utilized Cys mutants in two ways. First, by growing fibrils from single Cys mutants under reducing conditions, we could use chemical reactivity of the free Cys sulfhydryl group to probe the solvent accessibility of that side chain in the fibril. Second, by modifying peptides at the monomer level, then growing fibrils and assessing the equilibrium positions of the fibril formation reaction, we could determine the compatibility of the modified Cys side chain with the chemical environment within the fibril. Fibril Growth and Characterization—The ability to reliably grow amyloid fibrils from mutant Aβ-(1-40) peptides is a requirement for all the experiments described in this report. All peptides were purified, disaggregated, and subjected to amyloid growth conditions, including seeding with wild type Aβ-(1-40) fibrils, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Typical kinetics results for free Cys mutants, grown in the presence of the non-alkylatable reducing agent TCEP, are displayed in Fig. 2a, which shows a variety of lag times and final ThT levels. Mutants with Cys at positions 20, 21, 25-30, and 38 exhibited fibril formation kinetics similar to wild type. Mutants with Cys at positions 24, 31, 32, and 36 showed longer lag times, whereas those at positions 17, 18, 34, and 35 exhibited unusually low ThT signals. The D23C mutant peptide proved to be highly insoluble and therefore could not be used to grow fibrils. As discussed below, low ThT levels do not necessarily indicate the absence of fibril formation since there are large mutational effects on ThT signals of amyloid fibrils on a weight-normalized basis. The final equilibrium position of each fibril formation reaction was confirmed and quantified by HPLC analysis of the centrifugation supernatant of a reaction aliquot (“Materials and Methods”). The reduced state was confirmed by subsequent HPLC analysis and/or by reactivity with the probe alkylating agent, iodoacetamide. Representative electron micrographs of aggregation products are shown in Fig. 3. In the work described in this report, we set out to make fibrils from 75 different peptides (25 Cys mutants, each in three chemical states at the Cys residue). All except the Cys-23 mutant could be grown into an aggregate from soluble monomeric peptide. The vast majority (88%) of these aggregated products resembled WT amyloid fibrils, with 64% being indistinguishable from WT fibrils and another 24% being very similar. In addition, three of these peptides (L17C, V18C, and K28C) made filamentous aggregates that are particularly short, and another two peptides (G29C and the carboxymethyl-Cys derivative of A21C) produced aggregates that appeared to be a mixture of fibrils and other structures. Representative images of these different classes of structure are shown in Fig. 3. Because of their relatively low ThT responses (see below), we were particularly concerned whether the three short filamentous aggregates (L17C, V18C, and K28C) were actually fibrils or perhaps were protofibrils. The word protofibril was introduced to apply to distinctive intermediate structures that appear transiently in the early stages of Aβ amyloid fibril formation under native conditions (43Harper J.D.

Given the short lengths and low ThT responses, we were concerned that some of the aggregates formed by Cys mutants might be protofibrils with arrested development; this would not be surprising since it is known that certain mutations can extend the stability of Aβ protofibrils (49Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Naslund J. Lannfelt L. Nat.

First, we measured fibril diameters in the EM fields. Amyloid fibrils tend to have diameters in the range of 8-12 nm (16Sunde M. Blake C. Adv."
https://openalex.org/W2160618199,"Transthyretin (TTR) has access to the brain and nerve through the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. To investigate TTR function in nervous system homeostasis, differential gene expression in wild-type (WT) and TTR knockout (KO) mice was assessed. Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), the rate-limiting enzyme in neuropeptide maturation, is overexpressed in the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) of TTR KOs that, consequently, display increased neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels. NPY acts on energy homeostasis by increasing white adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and decreasing thermogenesis; accordingly, we show increased LPL expression and activity in white adipose tissue, PNS, and CNS as well as decreased body temperature in TTR KOs. Associated to increased NPY levels, TTR KOs display increased carbohydrate consumption and preference. In neuronal cells, absence of TTR is related to increased PAM activity, NPY levels and LPL expression, reinforcing that TTR is involved in neuropeptide maturation and that increased NPY correlates with LPL overexpression in the nervous system. Furthermore, we provide molecular insights to the reduced depressive behavior of TTR KOs, as NPY is anti-depressant. Our findings demonstrate that TTR KOs are a model for increased NPY and that TTR plays a role in nervous system physiology."

Despite a high similarity between the primary structures of E3BP and E2, the E3-binding domain of human E3BP is highly specific to human E3, whereas the E1-binding domain of human E2 is highly specific to human E1. In this study, we characterized binding of human E3 to the E3-binding domain of E3BP by x-ray crystallography at 2.6-Å resolution, and we used this structural information to interpret the specificity for selective binding. Two subunits of E3 form a single recognition site for the E3-binding domain of E3BP through their hydrophobic interface.

In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and phosphatase interacting with the complex are responsible for regulation of PDC activity by a reversible phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism that involves covalent modification of E1. PDC plays a key role in regulation of the flux of two-carbon acetyl units from pyruvate through acetyl-CoA into the Krebs cycle, yielding CO2, NADH, and H+. The E1 component catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate and the reductive acetylation of the lipoyl moieties of E2. The E2 component transfers the acetyl group to CoA. The E3 component oxidizes the reduced lipoyl moieties through reduction of NAD+ to NADH, thus preparing the lipoyl moiety for another cycle of catalytic reaction. Along with E3BP, the human E2 component forms the structural core of PDC and provides the binding site for E1 (2Hiromasa Y. Fujisawa T. Aso Y. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

The human E3 component (474 amino acids) of PDC and a component of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and the glycine cleavage system are flavoenzyme oxidoreductases that contain a reactive disulfide bridge and a FAD cofactor that are directly involved in catalysis (27Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Similar to bacterial E3, human E3 associates into tightly bound dimers required for enzymatic activity. In contrast, human E3BP (448 amino acids) is a monomeric but highly segmented structure consisting of three domains, viz. lipoyl (residues 1–80), E3-binding (residues 125–180), and inner (residues 215–448) domains connected by long flexible linkers (8Harris R.A.

Although the three-dimensional structure of human E3BP has not been determined as yet, it has been suggested to be similar to that of the human E2 component (1Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 8Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Wu P. Jeng J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19746-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which is also characterized by independent domains separated by long and flexible linkers. We have determined the structure of human E3 and the E3-binding domain of E3BP to shed light on the molecular mechanism of the association of human E3 with E3BP. We found that overexpressed recombinant human E3BP aggregated into non-homogeneous assemblies, which prevented us from performing detailed crystallographic studies of its binding interactions with E3. Therefore, a construct of the didomain containing the lipoyl and E3-binding domains of E3BP (E3BPdd) without the inner domain was used to allow for mapping of interactions with E3. We have delineated the key contacts and structural elements that contribute to the specificity and stability of the E3·E3BPdd subcomplex and evaluated these results for features that appear to be responsible for the specific association of human E3 with E3BP. 3The portion of this work concerned with the determination of the structure of this subcomplex has been presented previously (Makal, A., Hong, Y.

(2004) Poster presented at the American Crystallographic Meeting, Chicago, IL (July 17–22, 2004), Collected Abstracts, p. 93).3The portion of this work concerned with the determination of the structure of this subcomplex has been presented previously (Makal, A., Hong, Y. S., Potter, R., Vettaikkorumakankauv, A. K., Korotchkina, L. G., Patel, M. S., and Ciszak, E. M. (2004) Poster presented at the American Crystallographic Meeting, Chicago, IL (July 17–22, 2004), Collected Abstracts, p. 93). Construction of Human E3, E3BP, and E3BPdd Expression Vectors—The coding sequence of human E3 (mature form) was subcloned into the pPROEX-1 vector for expression of human E3 protein with a His6 tag at its N terminus and then transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue cells. The coding sequence of human E3BP (mature form) was amplified from pPDHE2/E3BP by PCR with two primers of 5′- and 3′-ends including NcoI preceding the first codon and XhoI following the last codon. The amplified DNA was ligated between the NcoI and XhoI sites of expression vector pET-28b and then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for expression. The expression vector for E3BPdd (amino acids 1–221) was constructed in the same way as that for E3BP. The DNA fragment coding for the His6 tag was added to the 3′-end of the E3BPdd coding sequence, and the complete coding sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting expression vector, pET-28b/E3BPdd, was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for expression. Expression and Purification of the E3·E3BPdd Subcomplex—Purification of E3 was performed as described previously (28Liu T-C. Hong Y.S. Korotchkina L.G. Vettakkorumakankav N.N. Patel M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Purified E3 was then digested with recombinant tobacco etch virus protease to remove the His6 tag at the N terminus of the protein sequence, dialyzed, and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml. For expression of E3BPdd, BL21(DE3) cells were grown in LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6–0.7 units. At this point, the cultures were supplemented with 0.2 mm lipoic acid and 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for overnight growth at 25 °C. Cells were harvested; resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the presence of protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 0.2 mm benzamidine); and incubated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min. The cells were then passed through a French press for disruption, and cell debris was removed. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. The column was washed with buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) and eluted with a linear gradient of 25–250 mm imidazole in buffer A. Fractions containing E3BPdd were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml. The resulting E3BPdd preparation was ∼95% pure as judged by densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following separate purification protocols, E3 and E3BPdd were combined in a 4-fold molar excess over E3BPdd and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Approximately 200 μg of combined E3 and E3BPdd in a 100-μl volume was applied to a size-exclusion chromatography column (Superdex HR-200) and eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. At this time, elution peaks were collected separately and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Only material from the elution peak containing two protein bands corresponding to the E3·E3BPdd subcomplex was concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml before being used in crystallization experiments. Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Crystals were grown from droplets of 2 μl of protein solution at 15 mg/ml and 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 10–20% polyethylene glycol 6000, 200 mm diammonium citrate, and 1 mm sodium azide. Droplets were equilibrated against 0.5 ml of reservoir solution at a temperature of 293 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a 1.1-Å wavelength at beamline X25 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory at a temperature of 100 K from crystals soaked prior to cryocooling in reservoir solution containing additional 15% (v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). Determination of the structure of the E3·E3BPdd subcomplex was achieved by molecular replacement for determination of the structure of E3 and by de novo building of the E3BPdd structure based on the phases obtained from the E3 content. The search model for molecular replacement was a dimer of E3 together with a FAD cofactor constructed from A. vinelandii and yeast E3 structures (Protein Data Bank codes 3LAD and 1JEH) (20Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Sokatch J.R. Betzel C. Hol W.G.J Proteins. 1992; 13: 336-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Toyoda T. Suzuki K. Sekiguchi T. Reed L.J. Takenaka A. J. Biochem.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27327) Google Scholar), which have 49 and 57% sequence identities to the human sequence, respectively. The orientation of the first E3 dimer (polypeptide chains A and B) was found with program AMoRe within the CCP4 program suite (31Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) and subsequently refined with the CNS program (32Brunger A.T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) using a maximum-likelihood simulated annealing protocol with non-crystallographic symmetry restrains. After a first E3 dimer was established, the iterative process of addition and refinement of four E3 dimers using the data from the 50.0 to 3.0-Å resolution range led to an overall R = 41.4% and Rfree = 41.6%. At this point, the total of five E3 dimers provided the phase information sufficient for beginning the determination of the structure of E3BPdd. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), the difference maps generated with the five E3 dimers showed a pattern of two parallel helices located close to the surface of each E3 subunit with three strands in the middle. Initially, the polyalanine model of the E3-binding domain of E3BP (helices α1 and α2) at one of the E3 subunits was refined and sequentially replaced with the complete sequence. Refinement of two E3-binding domains of E3BP (Fig. 1, C and D) at each E3 dimer led to superposition of residues 152–159 of the loop regions of the E3-binding domains of E3BP, large average B-values exceeding 100 Å2 for nearly all residues, and no improvement in the refinement statistics. Instead, the electron density pattern was interpreted as representing two alternative positions of E3BPdd, each of them with half-occupancy. Subsequent model building with the XtalView program (33McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) and cycles of refinement with the CNS program (32Brunger A.T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) led to further improvements of the model and R = 33.4% and Rfree = 35.6%. The average B-factor for the E3-binding domains of E3BP dropped to 36 Å2, a value close to the average B-value for the E3 structures (26 Å2) and reasonable for a small and loosely bound element of the subcomplex structure. Apart from the E3-binding domain of E3BPdd, there was no traceable electron density for the lipoyl domains due to disorder. Therefore, the process of protein structure determination was completed with the elucidation of polypeptide chains (A–J) of five dimers of E3, each of them binding two FAD cofactor molecules, and with the elucidation of nine polypeptide chains (K–O) corresponding to the E3-binding domains of E3BPdd located in two alternative positions in the unit cell in four of five subcomplexes. In four of five E3·E3BPdd subcomplexes, the E3-binding domains of E3BP were refined with 0.5 occupancy factors. The E3-binding domain of E3BP (chain O) bound to chains I and J of the E3 dimer was refined with a partial occupancy of 0.7. The final crystal structure of each E3·E3BPdd subcomplex contains coordinates for two complete E3 subunits (474 amino acids each) and 41 or 42 residues of E3BPdd for a total of 5256 amino acids, 10 FAD cofactor molecules, and 491 water molecules in the unit cell. The final steps of the refinement were conducted using REF-MAC combined with the translation-libration-screw protocol within the CCP4 program suite (31Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar), in which each subunit was assigned a separate anisotropic tensor. The final cycles of refinement resulted in R = 20.8% and Rfree = 27.5%. The Pro453 residues in all E3 molecules were refined in cis-conformation. The side chains of Cys50 in all E3 molecules were refined in two orientations representing the disulfide bridge at only half of the molecules. The break of the disulfide bridge likely resulted from radiation-induced damage to the disulfide bond incurred during the exposure. Analysis of the geometry of subunits with PROCHECK within the CCP4 program (31Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) showed that 86.1% of the residues are in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot, with an additional 13.9% located in additional allowable regions.

The crystalline subcomplex was obtained from the solution containing both proteins at a subunit molar ratio of 2:1, thus corresponding to one E3 dimer/E3BPdd molecule. The same stoichiometry of E3 binding to E3BP was determined previously (2Hiromasa Y. Fujisawa T. Aso Y. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6921-6933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the subcomplex was determined by x-ray crystallography using a combination of molecular replacement for the elucidation of the E3 structure and de novo building of the E3BPdd structure based on the phases obtained from the E3 content. The unit cell was composed of five E3·E3BPdd subcomplexes, each consisting of two subunits of E3 and one E3BPdd. Because no residues in the lipoyl domain of E3BPdd could be located in the electron density maps, we focused this study on the analysis of the E3 component and the E3-binding domain of E3BP of the subcomplex. Fig. 2 shows the structure of one of these subcomplexes (subunits G, H, and N as deposited in the Protein Data Bank (30Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27327) Google Scholar) and Protein Data Bank code 1ZY8). The overall root mean square deviations in the family of subcomplexes are small and range between 0.38 and 0.46 Å for Cα atoms. Overall Structure of Human E3 in the E3·E3BPdd Subcomplex—The biologically active form of E3 is a dimer in which the subunits are associated by a 2-fold symmetry axis.

Kahn R. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2890-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The overall root mean square deviations between the structures of known E3 enzymes (Cα atoms) are in the range of 0.65–1.2 Å2. The major differences are between the human and bacterial structures in the loop regions following the Lys37 and Ala186 using human E3 numbering. In these regions, E3 sequences from A. vinelandii, P. fluorescens, and the glycine cleavage system contain additional inserts of six to eight amino acids that extend the loops on the surface. Like all E3 structures, the human E3 subunit folds into four domains, viz. the FAD-binding domain (residues 1–150), the NAD-binding domain (residues 151–280), the central domain (residues 281–350), and the interface (C-terminal) domain (residues 351–474). The FAD-binding domain interacts with the other three domains; together with the similar NAD-binding domain, the FAD-binding domain comprises nearly two-thirds of the residues, and both present the layered β/α/β-type fold characteristic of nucleotide-binding proteins. Their secondary structures have the characteristic nucleotide-binding motifs consisting of a β-strand, a short linker, and a helix with a glycine-rich amino acid sequence (Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly) (40Wierenga R.K. De Maeyer M.C. Hol W.G.J Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1346-1357Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In human E3, the nucleotide sequence motifs start at residue 13 (Gly13-Ser-Gly15-Pro-Gly-Gly18) in the FAD-binding domain and at residue 186 (Gly186-Ala-Gly188-Val-Ile-Gly191) in the NAD-binding domain. A cavity between the FAD- and NAD-binding domains, which normally hosts the NAD+ substrate, leads straight to the re-side of the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD molecule. When entering the cavity,"

Bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase 1 (EC 6.5.1.3), the founding member of the RNA ligase family (1Silber R. Malathi V.G. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), is a very well studied representative of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, which includes RNA ligases, DNA ligases, and RNA capping enzymes. All members of this family hydrolyze a pyrophosphate bond of a ribonucleotide triphosphate and make a high energy phosphoramidate linking the nucleotide monophosphate with an essential lysine in the active site. This lysine is identified within a conserved motif KX(D/N)G motif (motif I) and is responsible for the formation of the covalent bond to ATP, NAD, or GTP (2Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). DNA ligases and RNA capping enzymes share five amino acid sequence motifs: I, III, IIIa, V, and IV (3Shuman S. Lima C.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Motifs III and IIIa are missing in the Rnl1 sequence (4Wang L.K. Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29454-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but are present in the recently discovered T4 RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) (5Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17601-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rnl2 shares greater sequence homology with DNA ligases and RNA capping enzymes compared with Rnl1. It may suggest that Rnl1 has a more specific role than Rnl2, although the function of Rnl2 still remains unknown. The biological role of Rnl1 involves the countering of a host defense mechanism invoked following phage infection of the bacterial host. The bacterial tRNALys-specific anticodon nuclease (ACNase) is kept latent because of the association of its core protein, PrrC, with the endonuclease EcoprrI, which stabilizes PrrC and masks its activity (7Levitz R. Chapman D. Amitsur M. Green R. Snyder L. Kaufmann G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Upon infection, T4 bacteriophage expresses a T4 Stp peptide (8Chapman D. Morad I. Kaufmann G. Gait M.J. Jorissen L. Snyder L. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which inhibits EcoprrI and activates the latent enzyme. Anticodon nuclease is involved in the 5′ cleavage of the wobble base of tRNALys (9Jiang Y. Meidler R. Amitsur M. Kaufmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This modification of tRNALys acts as a defense mechanism by inhibiting phage protein synthesis and, as a consequence, stops the infection. Bacteriophage T4 has developed a counter-defense mechanism using Rnl1 and polynucleotide kinase (PnK) to repair the break in the tRNA anticodon loop. Thus Rnl1 plays an important in vivo role in the spread of the bacteriophage. It has been shown that if PnK and Rnl1 are not present, viral protein synthesis is blocked by depletion of tRNALys (10Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufmann G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A second biological role for Rnl1 has been reported, the promotion of tail fiber attachment (TFA) 2The abbreviations used are: TFAtail fiber attachmentAMPcPPadenosine 5′-(α,β-methylenetriphosphate)MADmultiple wavelength anomalous dispersion. to the phage baseplate (11Snopek T.J. Wood W.B. Conley M.P. Chen P. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3355-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the absence of Rnl1 the TFA reaction proceeds at a slow rate. Rnl1 can enhance the rate by up to 50-fold (12Wood W.B. Conley M.P. Lyle H.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2437-2445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but does not affect the final yield of attached tail fibers. Ligase and TFA activities may be mechanistically unrelated because the reaction requirement and the response to some inhibitors are different (11Snopek T.J. Wood W.B. Conley M.P. Chen P.

Because RNA is more sensitive to degradation than DNA, it has been proposed that polynucleotidyltransferase ancestors catalyzed RNA repair/recombination and then may have evolved into other nucleotidyl ligases and capping enzymes by acquisition of different C-terminal domains. In the Rnl2 structure, there are no amino acid side-chain contacts with the adenine ring, suggesting that changes occur in the active site to achieve GTP specificity in the case of RNA capping enzymes (13Ho C.K. Wang L.K. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Rnl1 catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the 5′-phosphate and the 3′-hydroxyl termini of single-stranded nucleic acids (14Cranston J.W. Silber R. Malathi V.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7447-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sugino A. Snoper T.J. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1732-1738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rnl1 catalysis involves three steps and requires ATP and divalent metals. In the first step, the α-phosphate moiety of ATP reacts with Lys99 to form a covalent ligase-(lysyl-N)-AMP intermediate plus pyrophosphate. Formation of the (ϵ-amino)-linked adenosine monophosphoramidate is reversible. Secondly, AMP is transferred from the covalent intermediate to a 5′-phosphate RNA end. Finally, the RNA termini are sealed by the attack of the 3′-OH RNA via a phosphodiester bond and liberation of AMP, a process analogous to mRNA splicing (16Kaufmann G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 70-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Abelson J. Trotta C.R. Li H. J. Biol.

The structure highlights the interactions in the active site between AMPcPP, divalent metals, and the two different domains of the protein. Such data will be of value in the further characterization of the catalytic mechanism and in better understanding the role of the divalent metal cofactor in the enzyme reaction. Moreover, the C-terminal domain shows a new protein fold that is likely to play a role in tRNA binding. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of T4 RNA Ligase—The expression plasmid (pNHT4RNAligase) coding for an N-terminal histidine-tagged Rnl1 (MRGSH6GS-Rnl1) and the repressor plasmid (pDM1.1) were both transformed into Rosetta(DE3)pLysS for protein expression. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When the A600 reached 0.7, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl) plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication. The supernatant was clarified by high speed centrifugation and applied to a 5-ml nickel chelating column (Hitrap chelating column, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. T4 RNA ligase was eluted with a 0–500 mm imidazole gradient in buffer A. Ligase-containing fractions were diluted 100-fold in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA (buffer B) applied to a 1-ml anion exchange column (DEAE-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer B, and eluted with a gradient of 0–700 mm NaCl in buffer B plus NaCl. Finally, the protein was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex S200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl. The protein appeared to be monomeric on the elution profile. The peak fractions were concentrated to 14 mg/ml for crystallization. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was expressed using the methionine auxotroph strain B834 and purified using the same protocol. Crystallization and Data Collection—Rnl1 was screened in a total of 2688 droplets set up in 96-well Greiner plates using a Cartesian Technologies pipetting robot (672 standard conditions of Hampton, Wizard, and Emerald kits for the apoform and four different ATP analogues with MgCl2). Crystals of the complex with AMPcPP were observed growing from polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.2 m CaCl2. Selenomethionine-labeled protein did not crystallize unless 5 mm dithiothreitol was added to the reservoir solution. X-ray diffraction data for selenomethionine-labeled T4 RNA ligase-AMPcPP crystals were collected to 2.2Å in-house. Three-wavelength MAD data (peak, remote, and inflection) for selenomethionine-substituted ligase crystals were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility Beamline BM14 to 2.1 Å. Indexing and integration of data images were carried out with HKL2000 (MAD data set) or DENZO (in-house data set), and data were merged using SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). Two related crystal forms, belonging to either the space group P21 or C2, were identified. As the P21 form gave better data quality, we used this for all further studies. The cell dimensions of the P21 form are a = 105.1 Å, b = 39.9Å, c = 108.5Å, and β = 117.3°, with two molecules per asymmetric unit.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar); a total of 20 sites were then located. Automated model building was performed with RESOLVE and Arp/Warp, resulting in 79% of the residues being placed (38% of amino acids assigned). The remainder of the model was built manually using the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The structure was refined in CNS (crystallography NMR software) (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) using simulated annealing and B-factor refinement. Initially, the MAD selenomethionine T4 RNA ligase structure was rebuilt after the initial RESOLVE model and subjected to a few rounds of refinement, but subsequent work used the in-house data set, which, although of slightly lower resolution (2.2Å compared with 2.0Å), was overall of better quality. Phasing and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. tRNAGlu from Escherichia coli (Protein Data Bank ID code1G59) was docked on to the surface of Rnl1 using O. Overall Structure of Rnl1—The refined crystal structure at 2.2 Å resolution (see Table 1 for data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics) showed that the 374 amino acid Rnl1 was organized into a two domain structure. The N-terminal region includes an α helix (α1) followed by an antiparallel β-sheet (β1–β4) (Fig. 1A). Although this sheet is absent in the Rnl2 structure (apart from β4), it may play an important role in the Rnl1-catalyzed reaction because two amino acids of this region are involved in hydrogen bonding in the active site. The remainder of the N-terminal domain is structurally related to the N-terminal domain of the Rnl2 and consists of twisted antiparallel β-sheets flanked by α-helices. Organization of this core region is quite similar to the other members of the Rnl2-like protein family. Although the β-strands containing the nucleotidyltransferase motifs are very well superimposed, the α-helices are positioned more divergently (Fig. 2A). Although Rnl1 shares the same nucleotidyltransferase domain architecture with capping enzymes and DNA ligases, the C-terminal domain structure is very different among members of this family. Capping enzymes or DNA ligase have an OB-fold domain that flanks the nucleotidyltransferase domain, this OB-fold is absent from Rnl1 and Rnl2. The secondary structure of the C-terminal Rnl1 domain consists entirely of α-helices (Fig. 1, A and C). There is a very long α-helix (α-9) of about 30 residues that interacts with a series of four α-helices that lie almost parallel to one another but at an angle of ∼45° to α-9. DALI (26Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) searches did not find any structural fold in the Protein Data Bank similar to this C-terminal domain. BLASTP revealed that some proteins of unknown three-dimensional structure, such as the RnlA RNA ligase from bacteriophage RB69 or from bacteriophage 44RR2.8t, contain domains that share a high sequence identity (61 and 40%, respectively) with this C-terminal region of Rnl1 and thus will have the same protein fold. The TFA activity of Rnl1 may be related to the structural differences between it and other ligases. Although the second role of Rnl1 may have affected the evolution of the protein structure, it is difficult to draw any particular inferences about which structural features promote TFA activity.FIGURE 2Ligand binding to Rnl1.

The Rnl2 residue numbers are written in italics.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATP Binding Site—Analysis of the nucleotide binding site shows that both the N- and C-terminal domains are involved in forming interactions with ATP. The N-terminal domain makes hydrogen bond interactions via the side-chain hydroxyl group of Tyr37 to one phosphoryl oxygen from the γ-phosphate (Fig. 2B). The guanidinium group of Arg54 is linked by three hydrogen bonds to the AMPcPP, by two to the β-γ oxygen, and by one to the ribose 3′-OH. Arg54 and the Gly55 are conserved in all Rnl1-like proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis has indicated that Arg54 is essential for RNA adenylation (step 2) but not for enzyme adenylation or formation of the phosphodiester bond (4Wang L.K. Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29454-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The β-strands of the core region contain most of the residues involved in binding the ATP analogue. Lys75, Lys99 (motif I), Lys119 (motif Ia), Lys240 (motif V), and Lys242 (motif V) interact with the phosphate/phosphonate groups. Whereas Lys99 was found to be the site of adenylation in Rnl1 by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometric analysis (27Thogersen H.C. Morris H.R. Rand K.N. Gait M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in our structure the α-phosphonate is more than 3 Å from the Lys99 Nζ (Fig. 2, B and C). This relative positioning of α-phosphonate and Lys99 is presumably because of the presence of the methylene link in the ATP analogue but may also suggest that some conformational changes have to occur to allow formation of a covalent bond. A similar situation is observed in T7 DNA ligase, the Enterococcus faecalis DNA ligase, and in the Rnl2 structure, where the counterpart of lysine, catalytically equivalent to Lys99, is situated at a distance incompatible with covalent interaction with the phosphate. Moreover, Odell et al. (28Odell M. Malinina L. Sriskanda V. Teplova M. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as well as Shuman and Schwer (3Shuman S. Lima C.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have suggested from the Chlorella virus DNA ligase-adenylate intermediate structure that the nucleotide base conformation change, from syn to anti, accompanies the covalent attachment of the lysine. Indeed, it seems that a noncovalently bound ligand (ATP or NAD) in an RNA or DNA ligase has the nucleotide base in a syn conformation, whereas the conformation is anti if the covalent bond is made. This trend is supported by the Rnl1 structure where the AMPcPP adenine ring is in a syn conformation. It would, however, be difficult to infer whether the conformational change has to occur to permit the covalent bond to form or whether it is a consequence of covalent bond formation. Glu159 is conserved in the Rnl1 family members but is not found in other nucleotidyltransferase sequence motifs. Glu159 interacts with the ribose 2′-OH exactly as does Rnl2 Glu99 (Fig. 2C). No side-chain contacts are made with the adenine ring, but rather main-chain interactions are present via two hydrogen bonds, i.e. one with the main-chain carbonyl of residue Thr98 and one with a water molecule stabilized by Leu179 and Asn180 (main-chain CO and side-chain CO, respectively) (Fig. 2B). Because the adenine ring only makes contacts with the protein main chain in Rnl2 as in Rnl1, it has been proposed that the nucleotidyltransferase ancestor was ATP-dependent and could have evolved into GTP- or NAD-dependent enzymes by acquiring side chains in the active site responsible for ligand specificity (13Ho C.K. Wang L.K. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested, by comparison with the Chlorella virus motif IV Glu161, that Glu227 from motif IV coordinates a divalent cofactor ion (3Shuman S. Lima C.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Wang L.K. Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29454-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In our structure, Glu227 interacts indirectly with Ca2+ via two water molecules. These are the only interactions between the protein and the metal ion, which is coordinated to six water molecules and the AMPcPP α-phosphonate. Interestingly, as the Glu227 carboxyl group is situated 2.6 Å from Lys99 Nζ, this may indicate that the residue plays a role in the correct orientation of the lysine responsible for forming the covalent adenyl intermediate. In the Rnl2 structure, the same interaction is observed between Glu204 and Lys35 (Fig. 2C). There are no hydrogen bond contacts between AMPcPP and the C-terminal region, but there is an interaction between the carbonyl of Gly269 and the Mg2+ ion. The latter ion is also coordinated to the side-chain carboxyl of the conserved Asp272. Asp272 allows the correct placement of metal and thus the correct orientation of the phosphate. Divalent Cation Sites—Using transient optical absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy on T4 Rnl1 and DNA ligases, Cherepanov and de Vries (29Cherepanov A.V. de Vries S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1695-1704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have proposed that nucleotidyltransferase catalysis proceeds via a two-metal ion mechanism. It has been demonstrated that metal ions such as Mg2+ are essential for the joining of nucleic acids by T4 DNA and T4 RNA ligases. These enzymes react via the same mechanism, although DNA ligase shows a higher rate of ATP binding. One reason for this difference is the decreased Kd for Mg2+. Studies on nick sealing by Rnl1 (and also by T4 DNA ligase) have shown that it cannot bind ATP-Mg2 directly, but rather that ATP-Mg binds first and subsequently a second Mg2+ ion. ATP-Mg2 is thus the true substrate in the adenylation reaction (29Cherepanov A.V. de Vries S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1695-1704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reverse reaction (ATP formation) is also possible using Mg-P2O7 as a substrate. The Rnl1 structure shows Ca2+ (temperature factor = 22.1 Å2) coordinated to six water molecules and also interacting with one phosphoryl oxygen of the AMPcPP α-phosphonate (metal ion site A). A Mg2+ (temperature factor = 11.5 Å2) interacting with one phosphoryl oxygen of the β-phosphate is also present (metal ion site B) (Figs. 1B and 2B). Rnl1 only crystallizes in the presence of Ca2+, which can be explained by the presence of two symmetry-related Ca2+ ions at the crystallographic dimer interface. The positive charge of the Ca2+ ions is presumed to allow the interaction between the negatively charged surfaces of two Rnl1 molecules (Fig. 3A). Each of these Ca2+ ions situated at the interface is coordinated to residue side chains belonging to each crystallographic monomer. The presence of a Ca2+ ion is quite surprising in site A. It could be explained by the relatively much higher concentration of CaCl2 compared with MgCl2 (200-fold molar excess). However, a Mg2+ ion is also bound under these conditions at site B, so we can infer that the latter Mg2+ site is more specific and allows only certain types of coordination. Indeed, as mentioned previously, the site A Ca2+ does not directly interact with the ligase but via water molecules interacting with Glu227, Glu159, Lys99, Glu100, and Tyr246 (Fig. 2B). In the Rnl2 structure, Glu204 superimposes with Rnl1 Glu227. However, although the Rnl1 Ca2+ ion is replaced by water, three of the Ca2+-interacting waters are present in Rnl2. From this we conclude that the divalent metal site A is in fact the same in both Rnl1 and -2 and that Glu204 of Rnl2 also interacts via water molecules with Mg2+. Metal site B Mg2+ forms a closer interaction with the AMPcPP β-phosphoryl oxygen l (2.2 Å) than to the γ-phosphate oxygen which is 3.5 Å away. It also forms an interaction with three water molecules and two residues (Gly269 and Asp272), which belong to the Rnl1 C-terminal domain. Ho et al. (13Ho C.K. Wang L.K. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have inferred that the Rnl2 C-terminal domain is specifically required for the second step of the ligation (AMP transfer to the 5′-PO4 RNA) and that the domain is an obstacle to adenosine diphosphate RNA binding or sealing. Because both enzymes share a similar catalytic mechanism and because the Rnl1 C-terminal domain is important in stabilizing metal site B, we suggest that site B Mg2+ also plays a role in the ligation second step, most likely by interacting with the negatively charged RNA backbone. RNA Binding Site—Despite significant efforts screening with a range of ligands including ATP, AMPcPP, or AMP, we were unable to crystallize an RNA-Rnl1 complex. Rnl1 seems to crystallize only with AMPcPP, which, on the basis of the proposed ping-pong mechanism, is incompatible with the presence of RNA in the active site. Analysis of charge distribution on the protein surface gives an indication of a possible site of RNA binding. The majority of the protein surface is negatively charged, apart from the C-terminal domain, which presents positive charges that could interact with the RNA backbone phosphates (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we know that the RNA should be in close proximity to the ATP binding site to enable the AMP transfer from Lys99. Docking studies (Fig. 3B) suggest that RNA binds at the surface of the C-terminal domain, thereby positioning the anticodon loop toward the ATP binding site in the core region. Interestingly, the C-terminal architecture of the parallel α-helices (α-7 and α-10–12) positioned along the α-9 helix matches the tRNA groove architecture. As mentioned earlier, the Rnl1 C-terminal domain is unique among nucleotidyltransferase family members, suggesting that its topology evolved to bind specifically tRNALys in vivo. In the active site, a chloride ion (temperature factor = 17.8 Å2) is positioned 3.1 Å from the ribose 3′-OH and at the same distance from a Ca2+-coordinated water molecule (Fig. 2B). The negative charge of the chloride may mimic the 5′-phosphate of the incoming RNA as proposed for the sulfate ion in the Chlorella virus DNA ligase structure (28Odell M. Malinina L. Sriskanda V. Teplova M. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Odell M. Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nikolov D.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The chloride ion is situated above the AMP moiety on the active site face, which is accessible to RNA, and is sterically compatible with the position of a nucleic acid phosphate. Wang et al. (4Wang L.K. Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29454-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have reported the specific function of Arg54 and Lys119 in the RNA adenylation reaction. In our structure, Arg54 is 3.5 Å from the chloride ion and would be even closer to a phosphoryl oxygen if a phosphate occupied the same site. Thus, we suggest that Arg54 stabilizes and orientates the RNA phosphate by hydrogen bonding in the second step of the reaction. However, as mentioned above, Arg54 is also involved in the first step of the reaction, stabilizing the ribose 3′-OH and the γ-phosphate, although it has been shown that its mutation to alanine partial activity is retained in the first steps, whereas activity was abolished in the second step of the reaction (4Wang L.K. Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29454-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This raises the question of why such a seemingly important residue is not conserved in other nucleotidyltransferases. By superimposing the structures of Rnl1 and Rnl2, we observed that the position of the guanidinium group of Arg54 is quite close to corresponding group of the Rnl2, Arg55 (Fig. 2C). Arg55 is conserved in Rnl2-like proteins and is essential for catalysis. Interestingly, the chloride ion is replaced in the Rnl2 structure by a water molecule 2.6 Å from Arg55. Thus we postulate that Arg54, which is conserved in Rnl1-like proteins and belongs to a domain not present in Rnl2, plays the same role as the conserved Arg55, i.e. that of orientating the RNA phosphate in the active site. Lys119 has been shown to be as important for the second catalysis step as Arg54, because mutation of either residue interferes with adenylation of RNA (4Wang L.K. Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29454-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the Rnl1 structure does not directly indicate its role, we nevertheless suggest that Lys119, based on its placement at the entrance of the active site and the position of the chloride ion, may interact with RNA. Lys119 may interact with a 3′-hydroxyl ribose group, for example, and thus could be involved in the 5′-P RNA recognition. Although we have to keep in mind that AMPcPP might not bind as exactly as ATP because of its methylene group, and that Lys99 has to be deprotonated to make a covalent bond, nevertheless the Rnl1 structure still provides information about nucleotide binding prior to the adenylation reaction. The structure also provides clues about the ligation second step. We suggest, as in the case of the Chlorella virus DNA ligase, that the chloride ion mimics the 5′-P-RNA. We also suggest that Arg54, essential for the second step reaction, catalytically corresponds to the conserved Arg55 of Rnl2. Because all five nucleotidyltransferase motifs are present in Rnl2, it has been proposed that Rnl2 is homologous to the nucleotidyltransferase family ancestor (5Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); thus we infer that acquisition of the additional N-terminal residues, and especially Arg54, was an adaptation for Rnl1 to replace the missing Rnl2 Arg55. Moreover, the structure confirms the presence of two divalent metal ions in the active site and shows the essential interacting residues. Both metals interact with the ATP analogue and water molecules, but the site B metal also interacts with two residues of the Rnl1 C-terminal domain. The latter domain is a completely new protein fold, which presents a structure and a surface charge profile compatible with tRNA binding. The work reported here has thus provided structural information for a complete RNA 3′-5′ RNA ligase.

It associates with Dfp1/Him1 to form an active complex equivalent to the Cdc7-Dbf4 protein kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Swi1 and Swi3 are subunits of the replication fork protection complex in S. pombe that is homologous to the Tof1-Csm3 complex in S. cerevisiae. The fork protection complex helps to preserve the integrity of stalled replication forks and is important for activation of the checkpoint protein kinase Cds1 in response to fork arrest.

Hsk1 and Dfp1/Him1 both co-immunoprecipitate with Swi1. Swi1 is required for growth of a temperature-sensitive hsk1 (hsk1ts) mutant at its semi-permissive temperature. Hsk1ts cells accumulate Rad22 (Rad52 homologue) DNA repair foci at the permissive temperature, as previously observed in swi1Δ cells, indicating that abnormal single-stranded DNA regions form near the replication fork in hsk1ts cells. hsk1ts cells were also unable to properly delay S-phase progression in the presence of a DNA alkylating agent and were partially defective in mating type switching.

These data suggest that Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 and Swi1-Swi3 complexes have interrelated roles in stabilization of arrested replication forks. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Hsk1 kinase (the fission yeast CDC7 homologue) forms a complex with Dfp1/Him1 (the fission yeast DBF4 homologue) and regulates the initiation of DNA replication (1Masai H.

Dfp1/Him1 was also genetically identified as a radiation-sensitive rad35 mutant. Mutations in the N-terminal conserved domain of Dfp1/Him1 render cells sensitive to a variety of genotoxic agents, including hydroxyurea (HU), a compound that stalls replication forks (5Ogino K.

The C-terminal domain of Dfp1/Him1 (Dbf4-motif-c), which is required for full activation of Hsk1, is also conserved and proposed to play an important role in the response to DNA damage in S-phase (6Fung A.D. Ou J. Bueler S. Brown G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4477-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both Hsk1 and Dfp1/Him1 are hyper-phosphorylated in response to HU treatment in a manner dependent on the checkpoint kinase Cds1 (4Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that cds1Δ partially suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth of hsk1–1312 cells, suggesting that Cds1 may negatively regulate Hsk1 (7Snaith H.A. Brown G.W.

On the other hand, we previously reported that HU-mediated activation of Cds1 is substantially impaired in a hsk1–89 mutant grown at its permissive temperature (8Takeda T. Ogino K. Tatebayashi K.

Recent studies have identified a group of proteins that are required for activation of replication checkpoint in fission yeast. Mrc1, a mediator of the replication checkpoint, is essential for Cds1 activation in a Rad3-dependent manner (9Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F.

Swi1, a Tof1/Tim1-related protein, which is required for a programmed fork-pausing event necessary for mating type switching (11Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), is also known to be required for proficient activation of Cds1 (12Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Swi1, Tof1 (the budding yeast homologue of Swi1), and budding yeast Mrc1 are localized at the replication fork and are thought to be components of the replication machinery (12Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8342-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, Swi1, together with Swi3, is proposed to form a replication fork protection complex (FPC) that is required for stabilization of forks in a configuration that is recognized by replication checkpoint sensors (14Noguchi E. Noguchi C. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8342-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Swi1 genetically and physically interacts with Hsk1. Hsk1 appears to be required for proper arrest of the replication fork and its stabilization in conjunction with Swi1. General Techniques—Methods for genetic and biochemical analyses of fission yeast have been described previously (15Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar, 16Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, extracts from ∼107 cells were made by the “boiling method” as described previously (3Takeda T. Ogino K. Matsui E. Cho M.K. Kumagai H. Miyake T. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5535-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells expressing Swi1–3FLAG and/or Dfp1–13myc at their own genomic loci were grown to 1 × 107 cells/ml in 50 ml of yeast extract-supplemented (YES) medium. Cells were collected and washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 2 ml of SP buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 0.1 m KPO4 (pH 6.5), and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Spheroplasts were prepared by adding 0.5 ml of SP buffer containing 2 mg/ml zymolyase-100T, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. The spheroplasts were pelleted, washed twice with SP buffer, and resuspended in 1.4 ml of IP buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm sorbitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitors (number 8215; Sigma) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell extracts were prepared by sonication followed by centrifugation (10 min at 7,300 × g). Immunoprecipitations were performed in cell extracts with anti-FLAG M2 affinity-agarose (Sigma) and mixed for 80 min at 4 °C. The immunoadsorbents were recovered by centrifugation (1 min at 800 × g) and washed four times with 0.7 ml of IP buffer. The samples were eluted into 50 μl of SDS loading buffer. Antibodies—Mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), mouse anti-cMyc (A-14) monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Hsk1 antibody (22Masai H. Miyake T. Arai K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3094-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and rabbit anti-Cdc19 antibody were used to detect Swi1–3FLAG, Dfp1–13myc, Hsk1, and Cdc19, respectively. Rabbit anti-Cdc19 antibody was developed against the histidine-tagged recombinant full-length Cdc19 protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Strains and Plasmids—The following strains were used for this study: YM71 (h–), NI741 (h– ade6-M216), KO147 (h– hsk1–89:ura4+), EN3182 (h– swi1::kan), EN3381 (h– swi1–3FLAG:kan), EN3404 (h– dfp1–13myc:kan), MS330 (h– dfp1–13myc:kan swi1–3FLAG:kan), MS331 (h– dfp1–13myc:kan swi1–3FLAG:kan), MS332 (h– dfp1–13myc:kan swi1–3FLAG:kan hsk1–89:ura4+), NI453 (h– cds1::ura4+), NI464 (h– ade6 hsk1–89:ura4+ cds1::ura4+), NI391 (h– ade6 chk1::ura4+), MS320 (h+ hsk1–89:ura4+ chk1::ura4+), Y393 (h90), Y400 (h90 swi1::kan), NI278 (h90 hsk1–89:ura4+), EN3222 (h– rad22-YFP:kan), MS360 (h– rad22-YFP:kan), MS361 (h– rad22-YFP:kan hsk1–89:ura4+), MS363 (h+ rad22-YFP:kan swi1::kan), and MS364 (h+ rad22-YFP:kan swi1::kan hsk1–89:ura4+). All the strains are leu1–32 and ura4-D18. pE132 is a pREP1 derivative expressing Swi1–2HA-6His. pREP41-hsk1c3 is a pREP41 derivative expressing Hsk1 (22Masai H. Miyake T. Arai K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3094-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the yeast two-hybrid assays, pGAD424 and pAS404 vectors were used in conjugation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain Y190. Assays for Mating Type Switching—Mating type switching assays were performed as previously described (24Grewal S.I. Klar A.J. Genetics. 1997; 146: 1221-1238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). h90 strains were plated on sporulation medium and incubated for 7 days at 25 or 28.5 °C. Plates were exposed to iodine vapors. Colonies that have efficient mating type switching stain darkly with iodine vapors, whereas inefficient strains show mottled staining. Physical and Genetic Interactions Involving Swi1 and Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1—To better understand how the Swi1-Swi3 complex participates in replication fork stabilization, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to detect proteins that associate with full-length Swi1. This screen identified a cDNA clone that encoded the 88–545 region of the 545-amino acid Dfp1/Him1 protein and several cDNA clones that encoded potential interacting proteins (Fig. 1A). This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 1B, 13myc-tagged Dfp1/Him1 co-immunoprecipitated with Swi1–3FLAG. Hsk1 was also detected in the FLAG immunoprecipitate of Swi1. By comparison to the immunoblot signals detected with whole cell extracts, we estimated that ∼3% of these proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated, indicating that the complexes are unstable and/or transient in vivo. We also observed co-immunoprecipitation of Cdc19 (MCM2) and Swi1 protein (Fig. 1C), suggesting a possibility that Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1, MCM, and Swi1 are a part of a larger complex present at a replication fork. Interaction of MCM with FPC or with Mrc1 was previously reported in other species (23Nedelcheva M.N. Roguev A. Dolapchiev L.B. Shevchenko A. Taskov H.B. Shevchenko A. Stewart A.F. Stoynov S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We also explored genetic interactions between swi1Δ and hsk1ts mutations. For these studies we used hsk1–89, which is a well characterized temperature-sensitive mutation of the hsk1+ gene. Cells harboring this mutation are viable at 25 and 37 °C but unviable at 30 °C (Fig. 2, A and B). However, the growth rate at 37 °C is slow compared with that at 25 °C, indicating that the function of Hsk1 protein encoded by hsk1–89 is partially compromised at 37 °C (Fig. 2A). Indeed, we have previously reported that hsk1–89 cells have an abnormal nuclear morphology at 37 °C. The kinase activity of Hsk1–89 protein is severely compromised but can be activated to some extent in the presence of Dfp1/Him1 subunit in vitro. In vivo, the temperature-sensitive growth of hsk1–89 can be partially suppressed by overexpression of Dfp1/Him1 protein (8Takeda T. Ogino K. Tatebayashi K. Ikeda H. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the hsk1–89,swi1Δ double mutant was viable at 25 °C, but at 37 °C it showed a severe growth reduction compared with the single mutants (Fig. 2C). This synthetic growth defect would suggest that efficient growth of hsk1–89 mutant at 37 °C requires Swi1 function. Requirement of Swi1 for Survival of hsk1–89 Is Independent of Chk1—Because Swi1 interacts both physically and genetically with Hsk1 and both Swi1 and Hsk1 are required for proficient activation of the Cds1 kinase in response to replication fork arrest (8Takeda T. Ogino K. Tatebayashi K. Ikeda H. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we examined genetic interactions of hsk1–89 with checkpoint mutations. The cds1Δ mutation very weakly suppressed the growth defect of hsk1–89 at 30 °C, a finding consistent with studies of the hsk1–1312 allele (7Snaith H.A. Brown G.W. Forsburg S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7922-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and cds1Δ,hsk1–89 cells grew as efficiently as hsk1–89 cells at 37 °C (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the hsk1–89,chk1Δ double mutant displayed synthetic lethality at 37 °C (Fig. 3A). This growth defect was more severe than that of hsk1–89,swi1Δ cells (Fig. 3B). A similar genetic interaction was reported for chk1Δ and hsk1–1312 mutations (7Snaith H.A. Brown G.W. Forsburg S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7922-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is likely that hsk1–89 cells at 37 °C sustain spontaneous DNA damage that must repaired, thereby invoking a requirement for the Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint. Indeed, we have detected an increased amount of the hyperphosphorylated, activated form of Chk1 in hsk1–89 cells at 37 °C. 3S. Matsumoto and H. Masai, unpublished data. The similar genetic interactions involving swi1Δ or chk1Δ with hsk1–89 led us to compare the morphology of hsk1–89,swi1Δ and hsk1–89,chk1Δ cells shifted to 37 °C for 6 h. As expected, hsk1–89,chk1Δ cells appeared to be short in their cell length and frequently showed the cut phenotype (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, hsk1–89,swi1Δ cells were much longer and rarely showed the cut phenotype. In hsk1–89,chk1Δ cells, cells with reduced DNA content (<1C genome content) gradually accumulated after the temperature shift to 37 °C (Fig. 4B). However, hsk1–89,swi1Δ cells did not show an accumulation of cells with less than 1C DNA content, but they did display an increase of 1C cells, indicative of a defect in DNA replication initiation (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that Swi1 is required for the growth of hsk1–89 cells at 37 °C in a manner independent of Chk1. Indeed, Chk1 activation is still observed in a hsk1–89,swi1Δ double mutant (data not shown), indicating that Chk1 activation does not require Swi1. We attempted to isolate the hsk1–89,swi1Δ,chk1Δ triple mutant to examine the effect of chk1Δ on the phenotype of hsk1–89,swi1Δ at 37 °C and found that the hsk1–89,swi1Δ,chk1Δ triple mutant is lethal. This result further supports the idea that Swi1 and Chk1 are independently required for the growth of hsk1–89 mutant at 37 °C. Formation of Rad22 DNA Repair Foci in hsk1–89 Cells—The synthetic growth defect and frequent appearance of the cut phenotype in hsk1–89,chk1Δ cells indicated that hsk1–89 cells experience spontaneous DNA damage that triggers a Chk1-dependent mitotic checkpoint, as previously demonstrated in swi1Δ cells (12Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We investigated this possibility by analyzing the localization of Rad22-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein (17Du L.-L. Nakamura T. Moser B.A. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6150-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fission yeast Rad22 (also known as Rad22A) is a homologue of budding yeast Rad52 and forms nuclear foci at double-strand breaks and some other sites that have exposed single-stranded DNA segments (18Ostermann K. Lorentz A. Schmidt H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5940-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A large increase in spontaneous Rad22-YFP foci was reported in swi1Δ cells (12Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the numbers of the cells carrying spontaneous Rad22-YFP nuclear foci was obviously increased in hsk1–89 cells relative to wild-type. The effect was similar to that observed in swi1Δ cells, indicating that hsk1–89 cells experience spontaneous DNA damage or other abnormal DNA structures that are bound by Rad22. It is possible that replication forks are not stabilized in hsk1–89 cells, generating single-stranded DNA segments due to abortive fork unwinding, as was reported for the tof1Δ mutant in budding yeast (13Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). At 25 and 30 °C, the efficiency of Rad22 foci formation was not greatly increased in a swi1Δ,hsk1–89 double mutant, although some additive effects of swi1Δ and hsk1–89 mutations on Rad22 foci formation were observed at 37 °C (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that Swi1 and Hsk1 proteins largely work in the same pathway for suppression of spontaneous DNA damages during cell proliferation. Synergistic Interaction between hsk1–89 and swi1Δ in Survival of Genotoxic Agents—The genetic interactions involving Swi1 and Hsk1 were investigated in more detail by analyzing the response of mutant strains to HU, a compound that causes replication fork arrest by depletion of deoxyribonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 6A, the hsk1–89 mutant was only weakly HU sensitive at its permissive temperature of 25 °C. The swi1Δ mutant was more sensitive to HU than the hsk1–89 mutant and was less sensitive to HU than cds1Δ. Again, there was a synergistic interaction between hsk1–89 and swi1Δ in HU sensitivity. The hsk1–89,swi1Δ mutant was more sensitive to HU than either single mutant (Fig. 6A), suggesting that Hsk1 and Swi1 may act in distinct pathways of HU resistance. A synergistic interaction was also observed between hsk1–89 and swi1Δ in sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Both hsk1–89 and swi1Δ cells were sensitive to MMS, but the hsk1–89,swi1Δ double mutant was more sensitive to MMS than either single mutant or the chk1Δ mutant (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that Hsk1 and Swi1 act in distinct pathways in MMS resistance even though these proteins can associate in a complex. Taken together, our finding suggests that Swi1 has both Hsk1-dependent and -independent functions in the survival of MMS treatment. Overexpression of Swi1 Impedes the Growth of hsk1–89 Cells—Because the growth of the hsk1–89 mutant at 37 °C is highly dependent on the function of Swi1, we examined whether overexpression of Swi1 can suppress the growth defect of hsk1–89 at the non-permissive temperature of 30 °C. The swi1+ gene was placed under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 7, overexpression of Swi1 could not suppress the growth defect of the hsk1–89 mutant at 30 °C. On the contrary, at 37 °C, the hsk1–89 mutant bearing an nmt1-swi1+ plasmid could not form colonies when Swi1 was overexpressed in medium that lacked thiamine. Even in the presence of thiamine, which permits leaky expression of Swi1 from the nmt1 promoter, we observed very poor growth in the hsk1–89 background mutant at 37 °C. This acute sensitivity of hsk1–89 cells to even moderate overexpression of Swi1 is interesting in view of the genetic and physical interactions involving Swi1, Hsk1-Dbf1/Him1, and MCM (23Nedelcheva M.N. Roguev A. Dolapchiev L.B. Shevchenko A. Taskov H.B. Shevchenko A. Stewart A.F. Stoynov S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The overexpressed Swi1 protein may interfere with the MCM helicase activity, presumably located at the replication fork for continuous unwinding of the duplex DNA. The increased sensitivity of hsk1–89 to overexpression of Swi1 may reflect the attenuated MCM helicase in the mutant cells, because Hsk1 kinase is likely to play a crucial role in activating the MCM helicase at the replication fork (1Masai H. Arai K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). MMS-induced Slowing of S-phase Requires Hsk1—These results were consistent with the suggestion that Hsk1 is required for the proper arrest of replication forks, an event that also requires the Swi1-Swi3 complex. We examined this idea by measuring DNA replication in hsk1–89 cells exposed to the DNA-damaging agent MMS. Because hsk1–89 cells are not acutely sensitive to HU at 25 °C, we synchronized both wild-type and hsk1–89 cells in early S by HU and then released them into the cell cycle in medium without HU. We added 0.015% MMS or mock treated and used flow cytometry to monitor S-phase progression. In the absence of MMS, wild-type cells completed S-phase within 1 h after release (Fig. 8). In the presence of MMS, the rate of DNA replication was significantly slowed in wild-type, and most cells were still in S-phase at 2 h after release and S-phase was not completed even at 3 h. In hsk1–89 cells, S-phase progression was completed within 2 h after release in the absence of MMS. In the presence of MMS, the delay was very subtle; S-phase was nearly completed in 2 h and was completed by 3 h (Fig. 8). Thus, these results indicate that fork progression in the presence of DNA damage is accelerated in hsk1–89, suggesting that Hsk1 is required for the stable arrest of DNA replication forks and intra-S-phase checkpoint. It was previously reported that Swi1 is required for slowing of S-phase in response to DNA damages (21Sommariva E. Pellny T.K. Karahan N. Kumar S. Huberman J.A. Dalgaard J.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2770-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and we confirmed this result by analyzing S-phase progression in release from HU arrest in the presence of MMS (supplemental Fig. S1). We then analyzed S-phase progression in hsk1–89,swi1Δ double mutant in the presence and absence of MMS. The rate of S-phase progression was significantly reduced in hsk1–89,swi1Δ cells even in the absence of MMS (requiring 4 h for completion). In the presence of MMS, unexpectedly, S-phase was slowed down in the double mutant (supplemental Fig. S1), requiring 5 h for completion. It is possible that hsk1–89,swi1Δ cells suffer excessive DNA damage in MMS, resulting in widespread physical impediment of replication forks. Mating Type Switching Is Partially Impaired in hsk1–89 Cells—Swi1-Swi3 complex is required for the programmed fork-pausing events that lead to mating type switching in fission yeast (11Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To further explore the relationship between Swi1 and Hsk1, we attempted to determine whether mating type switching requires Hsk1. Switching-proficient strains mate and form spores that can be stained with iodine vapors. Heterothallic h– strains do not mate and remain unstained. Switching-defective swi1Δ cells switch mating type at a very low frequency and produced dark lines or patches where rare events of mating-switch had occurred. In contrast, the wild-type and hsk1–89 colonies produced uniformly intense iodine staining at 25 °C, suggesting that the hsk1–89 mutant is switching proficient at its permissive temperature of 25 °C (Fig. 9A). At a semi-permissive temperature of 28.5 °C, colonies of h90 hsk1–89 were still stained fairly dark by iodine, but dark lines or patches were observed, albeit at a frequency lower than in swi1Δ cells (Fig. 9B), suggesting that mating type switching is partially abrogated in hsk1–89 cells. This result suggests that Hsk1 is involved in the programmed fork-pausing event necessary for mating type switching, further supporting the notion that Hsk1 is required for the stable arrest of DNA replication forks. Both Hsk1 and FPC Are Required for Cds1 Activation after Fork Arrest—Fission yeast Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 kinase plays an essential role in initiation and progression of S-phase (7Snaith H.A. Brown G.W. Forsburg S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7922-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Takeda T. Ogino K. Tatebayashi K. Ikeda H. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been shown that budding yeast Cdc7 kinase is required throughout S-phase for activation of each replication origin (20Bousset K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 15: 480-490Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Recent studies of Swi1 in fission yeast and Tof1 in budding yeast have shown that they are components of the replisome and are needed to stabilize stalled forks caused by inadequate supplies of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) (12Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Swi1 forms a replication FPC with a 181-amino acid protein, Swi3, and Swi1-Swi3 FPC plays a crucial role in stabilization of arrested forks (14Noguchi E. Noguchi C. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8342-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Swi1 is required for proficient activation of the replication checkpoint kinase Cds1 in response to fork arrest, suggesting that Swi1-mediated fork stabilization is required for Cds1 activation. We previously reported that Cds1 activation in response to fork arrest is significantly impaired in hsk1ts cells (8Takeda T. Ogino K. Tatebayashi K. Ikeda H. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), leading us to speculate that Swi1 and Hsk1 may be involved in a common pathway leading to activation of Cds1 kinase after fork arrest. Interaction of Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 and Swi1 May Facilitate Stabilization of Arrested Replication Forks—We have discovered that Swi1 interacts with Dfp1/Him1 and Hsk1, suggesting a possibility that Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 may facilitate stabilization of arrested replication forks in conjunction with Swi1-Swi3 FPC. This possibility was supported by the following findings. 1) Rad22-YFP foci, which are constitutively observed in swi1Δ cells, accumulated in hsk1–89 cells even at its permissive temperature (Fig. 5), suggesting the accumulation of single-stranded DNA regions. This may be caused by destabilization of spontaneously arrested replication forks, as is the case for swi1Δ and tof1Δ (12Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). 2) Progression of DNA replication forks is not properly slowed down by alkylating DNA damages in hsk1–89 cells (Fig. 8), consistent with the notion that Hsk1 functions for the temporal arrest of moving replication forks. 3) Mating type switching is partially impaired in hsk1–89 cells (Fig. 9). While we were preparing this report, Sommariva et al. (21Sommariva E. Pellny T.K. Karahan N. Kumar S. Huberman J.A. Dalgaard J.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2770-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that Hsk1 and the Swi1-Swi3 complex function in the same pathway in checkpoint responses to alkylating reagents. Our finding of physical and genetic interactions between swi1Δ and hsk1–89 extends their observations and strongly indicates that there is functional interplay between Hsk1 and the Swi1-Swi3 fork protection complex for responses to arrested replication forks. However, unlike their studies, we have found that mutations in the swi1 and hsk1 genes display additive or synergistic interactions in MMS and HU survival assays (Fig. 6). The reason(s) for these discrepancies are unknown. They might be attributable to the properties of different hsk1 alleles or experimental protocols, but our data clearly indicate that Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 and Swi1-Swi3 complexes have both interdependent and independent roles in the response to replication fork arrest. Swi1-Hsk1 Interaction May Play Roles Both in Initiation and in Responses to Replication Fork Block—Swi1 is critically important for the survival of hsk1–89 cells at their semi-permissive temperature of 37 °C (Fig. 2C). Although Swi1 is required for proficient activation of Cds1 kinase (12Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), Cds1 function is not required for the viability of hsk1–89 cells at 37 °C (Fig. 3). On the contrary, cds1Δ partially suppresses the growth defect of hsk1–89 cells at 30 °C (Fig. 3), as was reported previously for hsk1–1312 (7Snaith H.A. Brown G.W. Forsburg S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7922-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although Cds1 activation is significantly impaired in hsk1–89 (8Takeda T. Ogino K. Tatebayashi K. Ikeda H. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), Chk1 is constitutively activated in hsk1–89 cells (data not shown), presumably functioning for repression of M-phase progression. In fact, hsk1–89,chk1Δ cells incubated at 37 °C for 6 h were short, and many cells exhibited a cut phenotype (Fig. 4A). The growth defect of hsk1–89,chk1Δ cells was more severe than that of hsk1–89,swi1Δ cells (Fig. 3). Snaith et al. (7Snaith H.A. Brown G.W. Forsburg S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7922-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) previously reported the synthetic lethality of chk1Δ with hsk1–1312. They also reported that Chk1 is constitutively activated in hsk1–1312 cells. On the other hand, we observed that hsk1–89,swi1Δ cells were elongated with very few cut cells at 37 °C (Fig. 4A) and showed accumulation of cells with unreplicated DNA (Fig. 2D). Thus, the requirement for Swi1 in hsk1–89 cells is not dependent on Chk1, but Swi1 may assist Hsk1 for S-phase functions. Swi1 might activate Hsk1 by recruiting Dfp1/Him1 for initiation of DNA replication or facilitate the phosphorylation of its critical target. Because we did not detect a decrease of Hsk1 kinase activity in the extract from swi1Δ cells (data not shown), it is more likely that Swi1 stimulates Hsk1-mediated phosphorylation of its target proteins, such as the subunits of the MCM complex. Indeed, a defect in entry into S-phase was reported in swi1Δ and swi3Δ cells released from a cdc10-mediated G1 arrest (21Sommariva E. Pellny T.K. Karahan N. Kumar S. Huberman J.A. Dalgaard J.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2770-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interaction of MCM with FPC or with Mrc1 was reported (23Nedelcheva M.N. Roguev A. Dolapchiev L.B. Shevchenko A. Taskov H.B. Shevchenko A. Stewart A.F. Stoynov S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and we also observed coimmunoprecipitation of MCM subunits with Swi1 and Hsk1 (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Thus, Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 may not only facilitate initiation of DNA replication through interaction with Swi1 but may also help maintain the integrity of the replication forks during the course of DNA replication through physical interactions with the replication fork machinery and with the FPC. These interactions may facilitate fork stabilization upon encounter of a fork block by inhibiting abortive unwinding of DNA. Although we did not detect apparent mobility shift of Swi1 protein on SDS-PAGE before or after HU treatment (supplemental Fig. S2), further works will be needed to determine whether Swi1 or other FPC components are targets of Hsk1 in a process that stabilizes replication forks.

Ca2+ acts as a secondary messenger in eukaryotic cells. One of the key proteins that mediate Ca2+ signals is calmodulin (CaM) 2The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinCaMBDcalmodulin-binding domainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinNTANi2+-nitrilotriacetic acidPMCAplasma membrane Ca2+-ATPaseACAautoinhibited Ca2+-ATPasebis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. a small, ubiquitous, and highly conserved protein found in all eukaryotes (1Snedden W.A.

Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Upon Ca2+ binding, CaM changes conformation, which enables CaM to bind to and regulate a wide array of target enzymes. The interaction between CaM and the CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) of the target enzyme is mainly hydrophobic in which two bulky hydrophobic residues in the CaMBD, the so-called anchor points, are especially important to anchor the protein to CaM. In addition, the complex is stabilized by electrostatic interactions between negatively charged glutamates in CaM and basic residues in the CaMBD (3Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 4Chin D. Means A.R.

No consensus CaMBD exists for proteins that are targets of CaM, but CaMBDs typically have a hydrophobic and basic nature consisting of 15-30 amino acid residues that have a tendency to form an α-helix. Based on the position of the two hydrophobic anchor points, the majority of Ca2+-dependent CaMBDs is divided into three classes, namely 1-10, 1-14, and 1-16 (6Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F.

The P2B Ca2+-ATPases including PMCAs (plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases) from animals and ACAs (autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPases) from plants are autoinhibitory proteins regulated by CaM. The regulatory region consisting of a CaMBD and an autoinhibitory domain is located in the C terminus in animals and N terminus in plants (9Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Membr.

These two domains are likely to be at least partly overlapping in both plant and mammalian Ca2+-ATPases, as has been shown for the human PMCA4b (isoform 4, splice variant b) (11Enyedi A. Vorherr T.

In ACA2, a mutagenic study has identified 11 residues in the N-terminal CaMBD of ACA2 that, when substituted, cause pump deregulation (17Curran A.C. Hwang I. Corbin J. Martinez S. Rayle D. Sze H. Harper J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30301-30308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, even though residues important for both autoinhibition and CaM binding in CaM-regulated autoinhibitory enzymes have been identified, little is still known on how autoinhibition is released by CaM. In the present study, the mechanism behind CaM activation of an autoinhibited enzyme has been studied using the P2B plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase ACA8 from Arabidopsis (18Bonza M.C. Morandini P. Luoni L. Geisler M. Palmgren M.G. De Michelis M.I. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1495-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Both the autoinhibitory domain and the CaMBD have recently been localized to the N terminus of ACA8 (14Luoni L. Meneghelli S. Bonza M.C. De Michelis M.I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Bonza M.C. Morandini P. Luoni L. Geisler M. Palmgren M.G. De Michelis M.I. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1495-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Bonza M.C. Luoni L. De Michelis M.I. Planta. 2004; 218: 814-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The CaMBD in ACA8 has been suggested to be localized between residues Ile-41 and Leu-66 (18Bonza M.C. Morandini P. Luoni L. Geisler M. Palmgren M.G. De Michelis M.I. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1495-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Geisler M. Axelsen K.B. Harper J.F. Palmgren M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 52-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Alignment of this amino acid stretch with other known CaMBDs (Fig. 1) indicates that ACA8 contains a CaM-binding motif belonging to the 1-14 class, in which the two hydrophobic residues, Trp-47 and Phe-60, could function as anchor points for CaM binding, or a 1-18 CaM binding motif like PMCA4b (21Penheiter A.R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Caride A.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2009-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with Trp-47 and Leu-64 as anchor points. Therefore, amino acid residues in the stretch from Arg-43 to Lys-68, comprising the putative CaMBD, were analyzed for their role in autoinhibition and/or CaM binding. It is demonstrated that residues involved in recognition of CaM and pump autoinhibition are separated in a helical wheel presentation of the CaMBD. This allows us to present a simple model for the mechanism by which CaM activates this autoinhibited Ca2+ pump. Plasmid Constructs—Site-directed mutagenesis of ACA8 was performed by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) to produce mutant genes encoding the individual alanine substitutions aca8R43A throughout to aca8L54A. In the case of Ala-50, Ala-51, and Ala-56, these residues were substituted with Ser. Three nucleic acid substitutions, G156A, G216C, and A217C, were introduced as silent mutations in the coding sequence of ACA8 to generate unique sites for the restriction enzymes SpeI and XmaI, respectively. This allowed for introduction of mutations by a cassette mutagenesis strategy to generate mutant genes encoding aca8N55A and aca8S57A throughout to aca8K68A. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Wild type ACA8 and mutants were inserted into the yeast expression vector, pYES2 (Invitrogen), under control of a galactose inducible promoter. For localization purposes, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to the 3′ ends of ACA8, Δ74-aca8, and aca8W47A in the pYES2 vector just in front of the stop codon of the genes. Δ74-aca8 does not encode the first 74 amino acid residues of the regulatory N terminus (19Bonza M.C. Luoni L. De Michelis M.I. Planta. 2004; 218: 814-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To produce recombinant N-terminal domain that could later be purified by NTA affinity chromatography, the coding sequences for the N termini (amino acid residue 1-143) of wild type and mutants of ACA8 were inserted into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET15b (Novagen) in this way fusing a (His)6 tag to the N terminus of the peptide. Yeast Strains, Transformation, and Growth Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain K616 (MATa pmr1::HIS3 pmc1::TRP1 cnb1::LEU2, ade2, ura3) (23Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) was used for expression of ACA8, Δ74-aca8, and the generated mutants. Yeast cells were transformed using a lithium acetate/single-stranded DNA/polyethylene glycol (PEG) method (24Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Johnston J.A. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: Practical Approaches. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 121-134Google Scholar). Likewise, the yeast strain K601 (MATa, leu2, his3, ade2, trp1, ura3) was transformed with the empty pYES2 vector. The transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy by plating on yeast medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose (Glc), 2% (w/v) bacto-agar, 50 mm succinic acid, pH 5.5, 0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 40 μg/ml adenine, 30 μg/ml of the amino acids His, Leu, and Trp, and 10 mm CaCl2. Complementation of the Yeast Mutant K616—Complementation tests were performed as previously described (25Schiøtt M. Romanowsky S.M. Bækgaard L. Jakobsen M.K. Palmgren M.G. Harper J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9502-9507Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Localization of GFP Fusion Proteins in Yeast Cells—Ura+ yeast colonies from transformation of K616 with the GFP fusion proteins of ACA8, Δ74-aca8, and aca8W47A, were inoculated in 2% (w/v) galactose (Gal), 50 mm succinic acid, pH 5.5, 0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 40 μg/ml adenine, and 10 mm CaCl2 for 3 h at 30°C. The cells were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in H2O. Three μl of a 1:1 mixture of yeast cells of A600 = 1 and 0.5% agarose were mounted on a polylysinecoated microscope slide (Teflon-printed multiwell slide). Fluorescence was measured with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2/MP; Leica Microsystems, Bernsheim, Germany) with GFP filter setting, excited at 488 nm, and emission recorded at 500-540 nm. Isolation of Yeast Membranes—Plant pumps were expressed in yeast grown in 1% (w/v) bacto-yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bacto-peptone, 2% (w/v) Gal, 40 μg/ml adenine, and 10 mm CaCl2, for 24 h at 30 °C. Microsomes were harvested as described (26Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberián G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The expression level of the Ca2+ pumps in microsomes (40 μg) was analyzed by Western blotting using a specific antibody against the N terminus of ACA8 (18Bonza M.C. Morandini P. Luoni L. Geisler M. Palmgren M.G. De Michelis M.I. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1495-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ATPase Assay—ATPase activity was determined as described (27Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). Five μg of membrane proteins from K616 expressing wild type or mutant ACA8 were assayed for 30 min at 30 °C in the following four buffers: 50 mm KNO3, 5 mm NaN3, 0.25 mm sodium molybdate, 5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 40 mm bis-Tris-Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml Brij 58, 1 μm A23187, 3 mm MgSO4, 3 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, with and without 20 μg/ml bovine brain CaM (1.2 μm; Sigma) and with and without CaCl2 to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 20 μm. Free Ca2+ concentrations were estimated by the program WEBMAXCLITE version 1.15 (28Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Activities without Ca2+ were subtracted from those with Ca2+ to give the Ca2+-ATPase activity. Addition of CaM in the absence of Ca2+ did not result in any change in ATP hydrolytic activity. Fusion Protein Purification—Vectors expressing fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) by standard procedures. Fusion proteins were purified from inclusion bodies on NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and renaturated while bound to the affinity matrix by a procedure from Amersham Biosciences (product code 18-1134-37) with the following modifications. The pellet was disrupted by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer. All buffers included 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol instead of 2-mercaptoethanol. Finally, fusion proteins were eluted with 150-200 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0. Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). If not indicated otherwise, γ-globulin was used as a protein standard. CaM Overlay Assays—Two μg of purified N termini were subjected to CaM overlay assays as described previously (25Schiøtt M. Romanowsky S.M. Bækgaard L. Jakobsen M.K. Palmgren M.G. Harper J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9502-9507Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As a protein control, 2 μg of the purified N termini were examined by Western blotting using Penta-His antibody (Qiagen). Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was achieved with a BIAcoreX optical biosensor instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using a NTA sensor chip (NTA bound to a solid support). Surface plasmon resonance buffers were as follows: (i) regeneration buffer: 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.35 m EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20, pH 7.4; (ii) immobilization buffer: 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant 20, pH 7.4; (iii) nickel buffer: 500 μm NiCl2 in immobilization buffer; (iv) eluent buffer: 1 mm EGTA, 40 mm bis-Tris-Hepes, pH 7, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ammonium molybdate, 5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mg/ml Brij 58, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm inosine 5′-triphosphate, and CaCl2 to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 1 μm. All reactions were done at 25 °C. The sensor chip contains two flow cells that are run in parallel of which one provides background corrections for nonspecific binding of CaM. After extensive washing with regeneration buffer followed by immobilization buffer, the NTA surface was saturated with Ni2+ by loading nickel buffer into the two flow cells (1-min pulse at 5 μl/min). The (His)6-tagged N termini were injected into one of the flow cells in immobilization buffer (20-min pulse at 5 μl/min) until a resonance response unit of 250-270 was obtained. The buffer was changed to eluent buffer and a concentration range (60-600 nm) of bovine brain CaM (Sigma) in eluent buffer was injected into both flow cells (80 s pulse at 75 μl/min). After the dissociation phase, the NTA chip was regenerated by injection of regeneration buffer (1-min pulse at 5 μl/min for 3 times). The data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore AB) and kinetic analyses of primary sensorgrams were carried our by global fitting using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Identification of Deregulated Ca2+ Pumps by Functional Complementation of a Yeast Mutant—In a number of autoinhibited proteins, such as CaM-activated pumps and kinases, the binding site for the activating protein overlaps with the autoinhibitory region of the molecule. To understand the mechanism of enzyme activation, a detailed characterization and comparison of residues involved in protein-protein interaction and autoinhibition is a prerequisite. Such an analysis has to our knowledge not been carried out for any autoinhibited protein activated by CaM. To investigate the relationship between autoinhibitory and CaM binding residues in a CaM-activated Ca2+ pump we focused on ACA8, an Arabidopsis plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase with a CaM-binding site at its N terminus (18Bonza M.C. Morandini P. Luoni L. Geisler M. Palmgren M.G. De Michelis M.I. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1495-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). First, a series of ACA8 mutants carrying amino acid substitutions in the presumed N-terminal CaMBD (Fig. 1) were studied for their ability to functionally complement a yeast strain (K616; Ref. 23Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) devoid of PMR1 and PMC1, the two Ca2+-ATPases present in this organism. It has previously been shown that a plant P2B Ca2+-ATPase is not able to complement pmr1 and pmc1, unless the pump molecule is deregulated either by removal of the regulatory N terminus (12Harper J.F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30301-30308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutant ACA8 pumps carrying Ala substitutions at six amino acid positions (Trp-47, Arg-48, Leu-52, Asn-55, Arg-58, and Phe-60) were able to support growth of K616 under calcium stress conditions (Fig. 2), indicating that mutations of these residues result in pumps that can functionally replace yeast Ca2+-ATPases. Localization of Plant Ca2+-ATPases in Transgenic Yeast Cells—Yeast Ca2+ pumps PMC1 and PMR1 are localized to internal membranes (23Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, improved ability of ACA8 mutants to complement for pmc1 and pmr1 could have resulted from re-localization of the heterologous protein within the yeast cells. Indeed, whereas ACA8 is known to be expressed in the plasma membrane of plant cells (18Bonza M.C. Morandini P. Luoni L. Geisler M. Palmgren M.G. De Michelis M.I. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1495-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), Bonza et al. (19Bonza M.C. Luoni L. De Michelis M.I. Planta. 2004; 218: 814-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) showed that Δ74-aca8 expressed in yeast is enriched in a fraction containing membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. To localize the recombinant plant proteins in transgenic yeast cells, ACA8 and two mutants, Δ74-aca8 and aca8W47A, were equipped with a GFP tag and expressed in yeast. Addition of the GFP tag to ACA8, Δ74-aca8, and aca8W47A resulted in pumps that supported growth of K616 to the same degree as non-tagged versions (results not shown). GFP fluorescence in transgenic yeast cells was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 3). For all three pumps, fluorescence was intense in the periphery of cells and around the nucleus, indicating localization at the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The pattern of GFP fluorescence was identical for all three plant pumps indicating that targeting of recombinant plant Ca2+-ATPase was not affected by the mutations. Measurements of Ca2+ Pump Activity —Increased ability of mutant plant Ca2+-ATPases to complement their yeast counterparts could be the result of differential expression. However, this possibility could be ruled out as all the pumps were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4B). Alternatively, improved complementation could be related to increased specific activity of mutant pumps. To test this possibility, the ATP hydrolytic activity in yeast microsomal membranes expressing ACA8 and derived mutants were analyzed in the presence and absence of CaM. Hardly any ATP hydrolytic activity could be measured for wild type ACA8 in Ca2+ buffer without CaM (v = 11 ± 1.1 nmol of Pi/min/mg of membrane protein; Table 1), whereas addition of CaM resulted in increased activity of the pump by ∼20-fold (v = 210 ± 11.3 nmol of Pi/min/mg of membrane protein; Table 1). N-terminal truncated ATPase (Δ74-aca8) had high basal activity that could not be stimulated further by CaM (Table 1), as has been shown for other P2B pumps illustrating that truncation of the N terminus releases autoinhibition of pump activity.TABLE 1Ca2+- and Ca2+/CaM-dependent ATPase activity of ACA8 wild type and mutantsCa2+aEach value with corresponding S.E. is from three independent experiments performed in duplicateCa2+/CaMaEach value with corresponding S.E. is from three independent experiments performed in duplicatenmol Pi/min/mg membrane proteinnmol Pi/min/mg membrane proteinACA811.10 ± 1.09210.07 ± 11.27Δ74199.81 ± 24.64227.06 ± 15.08R43A6.33 ± 3.65177.72 ± 9.84L44A14.58 ± 4.56141.31 ± 6.92Q45A4.23 ± 4.46227.70 ± 19.17Q46A7.18 ± 3.91256.80 ± 9.60W47A66.56 ± 14.76121.63 ± 11.90R48A75.03 ± 2.87116.17 ± 10.11K49A5.18 ± 2.42163.44 ± 26.44A50S10.22 ± 0.98138.84 ± 4.84A51S8.16 ± 3.28123.56 ± 7.67L52A51.90 ± 4.5696.76 ± 4.55V53A13.00 ± 2.21169.64 ± 8.45L54A30.33 ± 3.53107.17 ± 5.43N55A52.48 ± 10.1476.40 ± 2.83A56S4.68 ± 1.81140.70 ± 12.48S57A1.83 ± 3.47115.95 ± 5.77R58A47.58 ± 6.0146.34 ± 12.45R59A28.77 ± 5.21205.95 ± 13.67F60A95.28 ± 1.52119.43 ± 11.24R61A27.27 ± 4.84219.43 ± 25.77Y62A66.47 ± 6.42187.66 ± 13.62T63A11.64 ± 3.64174.47 ± 21.35L64A9.99 ± 1.09208.58 ± 6.66D65A14.67 ± 1.62143.39 ± 1.91L66A45.23 ± 6.19136.88 ± 5.32K67A4.59 ± 1.89144.31 ± 3.90K68A9.92 ± 2.56167.96 ± 6.69a Each value with corresponding S.E. is from three independent experiments performed in duplicate Open table in a new tab Six mutants, W47A, R48A, L52A, N55A, R58A, and F60A showed increased activity in Ca2+ buffer without CaM compared with wild type (v = 48-95 nmol of Pi/min/mg of membrane protein, Table 1). The activity of these mutants in Ca2+ buffer was between 50 and 100% of the activity in the Ca2+/CaM buffer (Fig. 4A). The deregulated mutants were all able to functionally complement yeast pmc1 and pmr1 (Fig. 2). In addition to these six mutants, three mutants, L54A, Y62A, and L66A, also showed an increased activity in Ca2+-buffer (v = 30-66 nmol of Pi/min/mg of membrane protein; Table 1) corresponding to 28-35% of the CaM-stimulated activity. None of these three mutants, although, were able to functionally complement the yeast Ca2+-ATP-ases. This would indicate that a certain activity threshold is required for complementation of pmc1 and pmr1 to occur. CaM Overlay Assays to Detect CaM Binding to Mutated ACA8 N Termini—After having identified residues in the putative CaMBD of importance for pump autoinhibition, we decided to map in detail residues of importance for CaM binding. For this purpose the N-terminal region of ACA8 comprising residues 1 to 143, as well as variants carrying single amino acid substitutions at every position in the stretch comprising Arg-43 and Lys-68, were expressed in E. coli as (His)6-tagged proteins. CaM binding was next examined by CaM overlay assays to purified, immobilized fusion proteins (Fig. 5). Binding to CaM was severely reduced in the case of four mutants (W47A, R48A, A56S, and F60A). Furthermore, eight mutants (A51S, V53A, L54A, R58A, R61A, L64A, K67A, and K68A) showed reduced binding of CaM compared with wild type. In all cases CaM binding was Ca2+ dependent, as interaction with peptide was never observed in the absence of Ca2+ (results not shown). Binding Kinetics of CaM to Wild Type and Mutants of ACA8—Overlay assays suggested that the number of residues involved in binding of CaM (12 residues) was significantly higher than the number of residues involved in autoinhibition (6 residues). To confirm this finding and to analyze the observed protein-protein interactions in more detail, binding of CaM to the recombinant N termini of ACA8 was further analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. This gave us the association rate (ka) and dissociation rate (kd) for CaM binding to ACA8 N termini, and then the binding affinity (Kd) could be estimated as the ratio between the kinetic constants of the dissociation and association reaction. Although binding kinetics were slightly altered for most mutants, four mutants, W47A, R48A, A56S, and F60A, showed a severely reduced CaM binding by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. In fact, it was not possible to estimate kinetic and equilibrium parameters for W47A and F60A, as the signal was too low, even at the highest CaM concentration tested (Fig. 6), whereas mutants R48A and A56S both exhibited a strongly reduced affinity for CaM (Kd ≥ 150 nm) compared with wild type ACA8 (Kd = 26 nm) (Table 2). The reduced binding observed by surface plasmon spectroscopy was well in agreement with our results from the CaM overlay assays (Fig. 5).TABLE 2Binding kinetics of bovine brain CaM to N termini of wild type and mutant ACA8 measured by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopyKdaEach value with corresponding S.E. is the average of at least three binding curvesKaaEach value with corresponding S.E. is the average of at least three binding curveskdaEach value with corresponding S.E. is the average of at least three binding curvesnm× 105 M–1 s–1× 10–3 s–1ACA826.4 ± 0.201.08 ± 0.0072.85 ± 0.003R43A17.8 ± 0.191.53 ± 0.0152.52 ± 0.001L44A46.4 ± 0.591.13 ± 0.0145.26 ± 0.002Q45A29.4 ± 0.341.15 ± 0.0133.37 ± 0.011Q46A13.3 ± 0.721.80 ± 0.0972.4 ± 0.012W47AbKinetic constants could not be determined because of low signal---R48A158.0 ± 4.101.00 ± 0.02515.8 ± 0.129K49A13.8 ± 0.372.06 ± 0.0542.85 ± 0.010A50S21.9 ± 1.021.28 ± 0.0212.79 ± 0.121A51S45.0 ± 0.801.30 ± 0.0235.68 ± 0.023L52A34.6 ± 0.551.21 ± 0.0174.18 ± 0.028V53A65.1 ± 1.171.63 ± 0.02710.6 ± 0.073L54A51.3 ± 0.631.20 ± 0.0146.16 ± 0.025N55A23.8 ± 0.331.05 ± 0.0142.50 ± 0.007A56S268.0 ± 7.921.12 ± 0.02730.1 ± 0.507S57A12.1 ± 0.211.35 ± 0.0231.63 ± 0.008R58A57.8 ± 0.821.13 ± 0.0156.55 ± 0.029R59A35.2 ± 0.601.08 ± 0.0173.81 ± 0.024F60AbKinetic constants could not be determined because of low signalR61A49.9 ± 1.091.18 ± 0.0255.84 ± 0.036Y62A20.8 ± 0.271.19 ± 0.0152.48 ± 0.010T63A16.5 ± 0.201.32 ± 0.0152.18 ± 0.007L64A79.5 ± 2.951.20 ± 0.0429.50 ± 0.125D65A21.4 ±"
https://openalex.org/W2155643508,"Proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts of small intrapulmonary arteries (FBPA) has been disclosed as an early event in the development of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale in response to hypoxia. We investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) in human FBPA exposed to hypoxia. Primary cultures of FBPA displayed a strong mitogenic response to 24 h hypoxia, whereas the rate of apoptosis was significantly suppressed. In addition, the migration of FBPA was strongly increased under hypoxic conditions but not the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin. Hypoxia induced a marked up-regulation (protein level) of both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, alongside with nuclear translocation of these transcription factors. Specific inhibition of either HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha was achieved by RNA interference technology, as proven by HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha mRNA and protein analysis and expression analysis of HIF downstream target genes. With the use of this approach, the hypoxia-induced proliferative response of the FBPA was found to be solely HIF-2alpha dependent, whereas the migratory response was significantly reduced by both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha interference. In conclusion, HIF up-regulation is essential for hypoxic cellular responses in human pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts such as proliferation and migration, mimicking the pulmonary hypertensive phenotype in vivo. Differential HIF subtype dependency was noted, with HIF-2alpha playing a predominant role, which may offer future intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2040563318,"The role of the C-domain of the ϵ subunit of ATP synthase was investigated by fusing either the 20-kDa flavodoxin (Fd) or the 5-kDa chitin binding domain (CBD) to the N termini of both full-length ϵ and a truncation mutant ϵ88-stop. All mutant ϵ proteins were stable in cells and supported F1F0 assembly. Cells expressing the Fd-ϵ or Fd-ϵ88-stop mutants were unable to grow on acetate minimal medium, indicating their inability to carry out oxidative phosphorylation because of steric blockage of rotation. The other forms of ϵ supported growth on acetate. Membrane vesicles containing Fd-ϵ showed 23% of the wild type ATPase activity but no proton pumping, suggesting that the ATP synthase is intrinsically partially uncoupled. Vesicles containing CBD-ϵ were indistinguishable from the wild type in ATPase activity and proton pumping, indicating that the N-terminal fusions alone do not promote uncoupling. Fd-ϵ88-stop caused higher rates of uncoupled ATP hydrolysis than Fd-ϵ, and ϵ88-stop showed an increased rate of membrane-bound ATP hydrolysis but decreased proton pumping relative to the wild type. Both results demonstrate the role of the C-domain in coupling. Analysis of the wild type and ϵ88-stop mutant membrane ATPase activities at concentrations of ATP from 50 μm to 8 mm showed no significant dependence of the ratio of bound/released ATPase activity on ATP concentration.

These results support the hypothesis that the main function of the C-domain in the Escherichia coli ϵ subunit is to reduce uncoupled ATPase activity, rather than to regulate coupled activity. ATP synthase is the enzyme responsible for the formation of ATP during oxidative phosphorylation. This enzyme, found on the inner membranes of mitochondria and bacteria, and on the thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts, uses the energy stored in a transmembrane proton gradient to produce ATP from the precursors ADP and Pi. The enzyme can be subdivided into two sectors. In Escherichia coli, the F1 sector is composed of 5 different polypeptides with a stoichiometry of α3β3γδϵ, and houses the three catalytic nucleotide binding sites. The F0 sector forms a proton-specific pore and is comprised of three different integral membrane proteins, showing a stoichiometry of ab2c10. During ATP synthesis, protons move through the F0 pore and drive the rotation of the c10γϵ oligomer. Movement of this “rotor” drives the sequential conformational changes in α3β3 that promote both the binding of substrates, ADP and Pi, and the formation and release of ATP as predicted by the binding change mechanism of Paul Boyer (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). The two b subunits, combined with the δ subunit, form a peripheral stalk that connects the F1 and F0 sectors, preventing their rotation relative to each other. In E. coli, ATP synthase is reversible and under anaerobic conditions can act as an ATP-driven proton pump energizing the inner membrane to power membrane transporters and the flagellar motor.

Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), have been seen in crystal structures. The N-domain is located in essentially the same position in both conformations, but in the up conformation the helices of the C-domain are extended and partially wrap around γ to make contact with α3β3, whereas in the down conformation the two α-helices fold on themselves and lie next to the N-domain on top of the c10 oligomer. It has been recently suggested (8Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ϵ subunit was suggested to adopt the down conformation when ATP is high, allowing ATP synthase to catalyze either hydrolysis or synthesis of ATP.Previously, we have provided in vivo evidence for rotation by fusing proteins of various size to the C terminus of ϵ (20Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition to stopping rotation, the larger fusion proteins also generated an uncoupled ATPase activity that was sensitive to inhibition by DCCD, 3The abbreviations used are: DCCDdicyclohexylcarbodiimideCBDchitin binding domainFCCPp-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazoneFdflavodoxinPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoride.3The abbreviations used are: DCCDdicyclohexylcarbodiimideCBDchitin binding domainFCCPp-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazoneFdflavodoxinPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoride. implying that it required movement of the rotor. Because the full 360° rotation of the rotor is blocked by the fusion protein, any such movement must be in a partial, reciprocating fashion. We hypothesized that the C-domain of ϵ serves a coupling function in ATP synthase, keeping the enzyme efficient by preventing rotation in the wrong direction during ATP hydrolysis. Blocking the proper interactions of the C-domain with α3β3 by addition of the fusion protein would block this function and allow the rotor to slip backwards. Based on these findings, we suggested that ϵ is involved in keeping the ATP synthase efficient by preventing uncoupled ATP hydrolysis.To test this hypothesis, and to test for intrinsic uncoupling in ATP synthase, we have separated the effect of blocking rotation from the uncoupling effect of C-terminal modifications by creating a series of N-terminal fusion proteins, C-terminal truncations, and a combination of the two. Fusion of a large 20-kDa protein to the N terminus of ϵ blocked rotation and inhibited ATP hydrolysis, but did not eliminate ATPase activity. The residual ATPase activity of this “rotation-blocked” enzyme was doubled if the C-domain was truncated. Truncation of the C-domain of normal ϵ resulted in an increased rate of ATP hydrolysis but a decreased rate of proton pumping, again indicating the generation of uncoupled activity. These results support our hypothesis that the C-domain functions to reduce uncoupled ATP hydrolysis. The mechanism for the generation of the uncoupled activity is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral Methods—Recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All plasmid sequences produced by PCR and primed synthesis were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Membrane protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane preparation, assays of ATP hydrolysis, ATP-dependent proton pumping assays, and growth assays were performed as described by Cipriano et al. (20Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ATPase assays performed under different concentrations of ATP were performed with the following modifications: The hydrolysis reaction was started by the addition of 0.3 ml of reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 2.5 mm PEP, 0.2 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, and either 8 mm ATP/4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP/2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP/0.25 mm MgCl2, or 0.05 mm ATP/0.025 mm MgCl2. Aurovertin D was prepared as described previously (23Dunn S.D. Zadorozny V.D. Tozer R.G. Orr L.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purified ϵ subunit was expressed from plasmid pES2 (24Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and purified as described (20Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed essentially as described by Cipriano et al. (20Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using PVDF membranes and probed with antibodies raised against the α, β, and ϵ subunits. Because the N-terminal domain of ϵ by itself washes off of the PVDF membranes, a modified procedure for blotting the ϵ mutants was devised where 20 μg of membrane protein were blotted and then fixed to the membrane prior to the blocking step by soaking in transfer buffer containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The monoclonal antibody raised against α (α-II) (25Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Dunn S. Gogol E.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Drs. Robert Aggeler and Rod Capaldi of the University of Oregon, and the monoclonal antibody raised against b (b-10–6 D1) was kindly provided by Drs. Gabriele Deckers-Hebestreit and Karlheinz Altendorf of Universität Osnabrück. The anti ϵ (ϵ-1) monoclonal antibody has been previously described (26Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem.

Final plasmids containing the appropriate ϵ mutants in the entire unc operon encoding ATP synthase were transformed and expressed in the unc deletion strain DK8 (28Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Construction of C-terminal ϵ Truncations—Plasmid pDC1 (20Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), containing the uncC gene encoding ϵA137H with an AvrII site immediately following the stop codon, was the starting point for construction of the C-terminal ϵ deletions. Products of 3 PCR reactions using pDC1 as the template, the M13R universal primer as the 5′-primer, and primers 1, 2, or 3 (see Fig. 1B for primer sequences) as the 3′-primer, were cut with XmaI and AvrII and inserted into pDC1 cut with the same enzymes to make pDC41 (wild type), pDC42 (ϵ88-stop), and pDC43 (ϵ108-stop), respectively. pDC41, pDC42, and pDC43 were then cut with PsyI and AvrII, and the small fragments isolated and ligated into the 8830 bp PsyI/AvrII fragment of pSD135 (20Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to produce pDC44, pDC45, and pDC46, respectively. These plasmids contain all genes encoding ATP synthase with wild-type ϵ (pDC44), ϵ88-stop (pDC45), and ϵ108-stop (pDC46).Construction of an N-terminal ϵ Fusion Cloning Vector—Plasmid pSD15 containing the 1182-bp PstI fragment of the unc operon cloned into the PstI site of pUC8 (29Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3770) Google Scholar) was the starting point for construction of the N-terminal ϵ fusions. To facilitate the construction, the single BamHI restriction site and one of two AatII sites were removed. The single BamHI site in pUC8 sequence was removed by digestion with BamHI, blunting the 5′ overhangs with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and religating to produce pDC39. The AatII site in pUC8 sequence was removed by partial digestion with AatII, isolation of singly cut linear plasmid by gel purification, treatment with T4 DNA polymerase to remove the 3′ overhangs, and ligation of the blunted ends. Transformants for which the AatII site within pUC8 vector sequence had been removed were screened by restriction mapping to identify pDC62. Two partially overlapping oligonucleotides (primers 4 and 5) were annealed and made double-stranded by treatment with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, digested with AatII, and inserted into the single AatII site in pDC62 to make pDC40. To facilitate future cloning steps the AvrII site just after the stop codon of the ϵ gene was moved into pDC40. The 465-bp BsaBI/HindIII fragment of pDC41 was inserted into pDC40 using those sites to produce pDC47. The sequence of pDC47 corresponding to the N terminus of ϵ is shown in detail in Fig. 1A.Construction of N-terminal ϵ Fusions—PCR reactions using either primers 6 and 7 or else primers 8 and 9 were used to amplify DNA fragments carrying the CBD from the Bacillus circulans chitinase A1 (chiA1, Swiss-Prot P20533) and the E. coli flavodoxin (fldA, Swiss-Prot P23243) using plasmid pTYB1 (New England Biolabs) and E. coli chromosomal DNA as templates, respectively. Insertion of the PCR products into pDC47 using KpnI and BamHI yielded plasmids pDC48 and pDC49, which contain the N-terminal CBD-ϵ and flavodoxin-ϵ (Fd-ϵ) fusions, respectively. These mutants were then moved into the unc operon on plasmid pSD135 using the EagI and AvrII sites to produce pDC52 (CBD-ϵ) and pDC53 (Fd-ϵ).Construction of N-terminal Fusion/C-terminal Deletion ϵ Double Mutants—The deletion mutant ϵ88-stop was fused with the N-terminal fusions as follows: The 312-bp HindIII/BsaBI fragment of pDC42 was moved into pDC48 and pDC49, which had been cut with the same enzymes to produce pDC50 (CBD-ϵ88-stop) and pDC51 (flavodoxin-ϵ88-stop), respectively. These mutants were then moved into the unc operon on plasmid pSD135 using the EagI and AvrII sites to produce pDC54 (CBD-ϵ88-stop) and pDC55 (flavodoxin-ϵ88-stop).RESULTSConstruction of N-terminal ϵ Fusions and C-terminal ϵ Truncations—To investigate the effect of physically blocking rotation in ATP synthase and the role of the C-domain in energy coupling, a series of N-terminal fusion proteins were constructed both in the presence and absence of the C-domain. The strategy was: 1) to block rotation of the rotor with the N-terminal fusions while leaving the C terminus intact, allowing us to ask how tightly ATP hydrolysis is coupled to rotation; 2) to remove the C-domain from this rotation-blocked ATP synthase to study the uncoupling effect of a C-terminal truncation in the absence of rotation, and 3) to test the uncoupling effect of C-terminal ϵ truncations in rotation-allowed ATP synthase. Based on previous results with the small C-terminal ϵ fusion protein (20Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the removal of the ϵ C-domain should result in increased rates of DCCD-sensitive ATP hydrolysis that are uncoupled from proton pumping.The N-terminal fusions were designed to avoid or minimize effects on the translation of the mRNA, the folding of the ϵ polypeptide, or the assembly of ATP synthase (Fig. 1, A and B). Because translation efficiency depends on nucleotide sequences both upstream and downstream of the start codon, no changes were made in either the upstream region or the sequence encoding the first 10 amino acid residues of ϵ. A doubled-stranded oligonucleotide prepared from primers 4 and 5 (Fig. 1B) was cloned into the AatII site. This oligonucleotide included KpnI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites for subsequent insertion of the fusions, a sequence encoding a 13-residue linker designed to form an α-helical segment bounded by flexible Gly-Ser hinges and a repeat of the sequence encoding the natural ϵ residues from Ala-1 to those residues encoded within the AatII site itself. The N-terminal methionine of ϵ is normally removed (30Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The repeat of the N-terminal sequence provided the residues of the first strand of the flattened β-barrel of the N-domain with the normal downstream context. The construct (Figs. 1A and 2A) can be viewed as encoding the mature ϵ polypeptide preceded by a leader that provided normal levels of translation initiation, sites for N-terminal fusions, and the flexible linker.FIGURE 2Schematic representation of the ϵ mutants created for this study. A, the general structure of all N-terminal ϵ fusions created. The fused proteins were inserted into the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites fusing the proteins between a 9-residue leader sequence and a 13-residue flexible linker.

This is a schematic representation showing the overall structure of the mutants and is not necessarily drawn to scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ϵ mutants constructed for this study are illustrated in Fig. 2B. Either the 20-kDa E. coli flavodoxin or the 5-kDa CBD from the B. circulans chitinase A1 protein were inserted as N-terminal fusions. Truncations of ϵ after residue Gln-87 or Ser-107 were also constructed, removing the entire C-domain or just the C-terminal helix, respectively. N-terminal fusions were constructed for ϵ88-stop. These forms of ϵ were expressed from the unc operon in a derivative of plasmid pACWU1.2 (31Kuo P.H. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in the unc-deficient strain DK8 (28Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Growth Characteristics of N-terminal Fusions/C-terminal Truncations—To address the ability of these mutant ϵ subunits to provide normal ϵ function in vivo, transformants of DK8 (28Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying plasmids expressing F1F0 were tested for the ability to grow on agar plates containing acetate as the sole carbon and energy source (Table 1). Growth on acetate tests for the function of ATP synthase because no substrate level phosphorylation is possible, and the cells rely solely on oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Fusion of the relatively small CBD to the N terminus of ϵ had no effect on the essential function of ϵ, because cells bearing this mutation gave rise to colonies of the same size as the wild type. Cells bearing the C-terminal truncations of either normal ϵ or CBD-ϵ also grew. However, the larger flavodoxin-ϵ and flavodoxin-ϵ88-stop mutants did not grow on acetate indicating that the larger N-terminal fusion blocks the normal function of ATP synthase. We interpret this as the prevention of full 360° rotation because of steric restraints imposed on the rotor by the proximity of the b2 stator.TABLE 1Growth properties of ϵ-fusion strains All cells were grown at 37 °C using M9 minimal medium and the appropriate carbon source. Acetate growth tests were performed using agar plates containing 0.2% sodium acetate. Growth was assessed after incubation for 3 days.

To address these concerns membrane vesicles were prepared and Western blots performed probing with antibodies raised against the α, ϵ, and b subunits (Fig. 3). There was a low but detectable level of α in membranes prepared from the Δϵ strain likely attributed to a small amount of F1 that was trapped in the pellet during the preparation. Membranes prepared from strains carrying the various ϵ deletions and fusions all had a relatively normal amount of α in the membranes indicating that the ϵ mutants do not interfere with the proper assembly of F1F0.FIGURE 3Effect of ϵ mutation on F1F0 assembly and ϵ stability. Samples of membrane protein (2 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Western blotting to PVDF membranes. Blots were probed with 125I-labeled antibodies raised against α (A), b (B), and ϵ (C). Anti-ϵ blots failed to show ϵ88-stop unless 20 μg of protein were blotted and fixed to the membrane by soaking in transfer buffer with 0.5% glutaraldehyde before the blocking step.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ϵ88-stop construct was washed off the PVDF membranes using our standard blotting procedure (32Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To correct for this the blot was fixed prior to the blocking step by soaking in transfer buffer containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min. This allowed us to detect the ϵ88-stop construct, although it could not be quantified. With this limitation, there was no detectable degradation of the ϵ fusion proteins (even when blots were overexposed) indicating that the fusion proteins were stable (Fig. 3C).Analysis of ATPase Activity of Membrane-bound F1F0—To further analyze the effect of the N-terminal fusions and C-terminal truncations, the membranes described above were assayed for ATPase activity (Table 2). As noted previously with this expression system (20Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), there is significant variability in the amount of F1F0 present in different membrane preparations. This was true not only for preparations from cells with different plasmids but also for different preparations from the same plasmid/strain. For this reason, membranes were assayed for the ATPase activity of both membrane-bound F1F0 and for the activity of F1 after dissociation from F0 and ϵ, the latter providing a measure of the amount of ATP synthase present in the membranes. The membrane-bound ATPase activities were then normalized to the activity of soluble F1 released from these preparations, and expressed as the fraction of units bound per unit released, a unitless ratio that we call normalized activity. This treatment of the data gave reproducible results independent of the level of F1F0 in different preparations from the same strain. Previously we have shown that membrane-bound F1F0 typically shows a normalized activity of ∼0.4 (20Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here the membrane-bound wild-type ATP synthase showed a normalized activity of 0.44 and was 85% inhibited by treatment with the F0-specific inhibitor, DCCD (Table 2). It should be noted that in all cases DCCD treatment showed less than 12% inhibition of the released activity (data not shown), indicating the specific labeling of F0 and not F1. The fusion of the 5-kDa CBD to the N terminus of ϵ had no effect on either the normalized hydrolysis activity (0.42), or the DCCD sensitivity (83%), of the membrane-bound enzyme implying that the N-terminal modification itself had no effect on expression of ϵ or assembly of the ATP synthase.TABLE 2ATPase activity of membrane vesicles Membranes were suspended to 2 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl in the presence or absence of 50 μm DCCD, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2087650777,"The role of antizyme (AZ) and glycosaminoglycans in polyamine uptake by mammalian cells and mitochondria was examined using NIH3T3 and FM3A cells and rat liver mitochondria. AZ is synthesized as two isoforms (29 and 24.5 kDa) due to the existence of two initiation codon AUGs in the AZ mRNA. Most AZ existed as the 24.5-kDa form translatable from the second AUG, but a portion of the 29-kDa AZ from the first AUG was associated with mitochondria because of the presence of a mitochondrial targeting signal between the first and the second methionine. The predominance of the 24.5-kDa isoform was mainly due to the presence of spermidine and a favorable sequence context (Kozak sequence) at the second initiation codon AUG. Spermine uptake by NIH3T3 cells was inhibited by both 29- and 24.5-kDa AZs, but uptake by rat liver mitochondria was not influenced by either form of AZ. Because spermine uptake by mitochondria caused a release of cytochrome c, an enhancer of apoptosis, we looked for inhibitors of mitochondrial spermine uptake other than AZ. Cations such as Na+, K+, and Mg2+ were inhibitors of the mitochondrial uptake. It has been reported that heparan sulfate on glypican-1 plays important roles in spermine uptake by human embryonic lung fibroblasts. Heparin, but not heparan sulfate, slightly inhibited spermine uptake by FM3A cells in the absence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ but had no effect under physiological conditions in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+.

The cellular content of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), which play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, is regulated by biosynthesis, degradation, and transport (1Cohen S.S.

However, UGA4 was a putrescine/γ-aminobutyric acid cotransporter, and GAP1 was a cotransporter of putrescine and spermidine with amino acids. Most recently, genes encoding polyamine-specific transporters were identified in yeast (AGP2) and Leishmania major (LmPOT1) (16Aouida M. Leduc A. Poulin R. Ramotar D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24267-24276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Hasne M.-P. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15188-15194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells there is no report of the molecular identification of a polyamine transporter. It has been reported that glypican-1 is a vehicle for polyamine uptake (18Belting M. Mani K. Jönsson M. Cheng F. Sandgren S. Jonsson S. Ding K. Delcros J.-G. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47181-47189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is thought that polyamines first bind to heparan sulfate on glypican-1 and then they are taken into cells through endocytosis. However, Poulin and co-workers (19Soulet D. Gagnon B. Rivest S. Audette M. Poulin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49355-49366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), using a polyamine conjugated to a fluorescent dye, proposed that polyamines are imported first by a plasma membrane carrier and then sequestered into preexisting polyamine-sequestering vesicles.

Then a second PCR was performed using the initial PCR products as template and 5′-AflAZ and 3′-XbaAZ as primers. The PCR product was digested with AflII and XbaI and inserted into the same site of pTracer-CMV. To prepare a pTracer-AZΔT205ΔAUG1 and pTracer-AZΔT205 Non-Kozak, PCR was performed using pGEM-AZΔT205 as template and 5′-ATACTTAAGCCTTGGTGAAATCCT-3′ (5′-AflAZ/A1T) and 5′-ATACTTAAGCCATGCCGCTTCTTA-3′ (3′-AflAZ/A1T) and 5′-TAGGTACCGGATGGTGAAATCCT-3′ (5′-Kpn-nKAZ) and 3′-XbaAZ as primers. PCR products were digested with AflII or KpnI plus XbaI and inserted into the same site of pTracer-CMV. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence determination using a Seq 4 × 4 personal sequencing system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—ODC-overproducing cells (EXOD-1) of mouse mammary carcinoma FM3A cells were obtained as described previously (33Kameji T. Hayashi S. Hoshino K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and FM3A and EXOD-1 cells were cultured in ES medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 50 units/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (WI-38, RCB0704) were purchased from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured in minimum essential medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.) supplemented with 50 units/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.) supplemented with 50 units/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. NIH3T3 cells (2.5 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of several kinds of pTracer-AZΔT205 or vector pTracer-CMV using LIPOFECT AMINE PLUS kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were cultured for 18 h after transfection. Spermine Transport Assay—NIH3T3, FM3A, or human embryonic lung WI-38 cells (3 × 106) in 1 ml of NaCl buffer (135 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.2) (34Kakinuma Y. Hoshino K. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and then the uptake assay was started by the addition of [14C]spermine at a final concentration of 10 μm (740 MBq/mmol). After incubation at 30 °C for 4, 8, or 12 min, cells (3 × 106) were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mm spermine. Washed cells were lysed with 0.6 ml of Renilla luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega), and a 0.5-ml aliquot was used for the measurement of radioactivity by a liquid scintillation counter. The uptake rate was linear during the incubation time. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated as follows. Rat liver (1 g) was minced and then homogenized with 9 ml of mannitol buffer containing 5mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.22 m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA. After the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min, mitochondria were obtained by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondria were suspended again with mannitol buffer and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min. The precipitate was suspended with 2.67 ml of sucrose buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.2 m sucrose, 5 mm succinate, 2 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 1.25 μm rotenone, an inhibitor of respiration of endogenous substrate, and used for the assay of spermine uptake. Mitochondria solution was preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min, and the uptake assay was started by the addition of 0.03 ml of [14C]spermine at a final concentration of 100 μm (92.5 MBq/mmol). After incubation at 25 °C for 5, 10, or 20 min, mitochondria were recovered by loading 0.8 ml of the reaction mixture over 0.5 ml of lauryl bromide and centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min. After the mitochondria were solubilized by 1% SDS, [14C]spermine incorporated into mitochondria was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. The uptake rate was linear during the incubation time. Western Blotting of AZ and Cytochrome c—For isolation of mitochondria and the cytoplasmic fraction from NIH3T3 cells, cells (3 × 107) were homogenized with 9 volumes of buffer A containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm FUT-175 (6-amino-2-naphthyl-4-guanidinobenzoate), a protease inhibitor (35Fujii S. Hitomi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 661: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). FUT-175 was kindly supplied by Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan. Freezing and thawing were repeated four times. After the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, mitochondria were obtained by centrifugation at 33,000 × g for 7 min. The cytoplasmic fraction was then obtained by centrifugation at 78,000 × g for 100 min. For Western blotting, 20 μg of protein was separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred on to Immobilon transfer membrane (Millipore), and AZ was detected using an antibody against AZ followed by ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against AZ was kindly supplied by Dr. S. Matsufuji, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was measured by Western blotting of cytochrome c using the supernatant of the reaction mixture for the assay for spermine uptake obtained by centrifugation at 33,000 × g for 7 min. Monoclonal antibody against mouse cytochrome c was obtained from R & D Systems, Inc. The level of AZ and cytochrome c was quantified by a LAS-1000 plus luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Film). Assay for ODC—NIH3T3 cells (2 × 107) were suspended in 0.8 ml of buffer B containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 μm FUT-175. Cells were frozen, thawed, and homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant, thus, obtained was dialyzed against buffer B and used for ODC assay. The assay was performed as described previously (36Kakinuma Y. Sakamaki Y. Ito K. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In Vitro AZ Synthesis and Measurement of Its Stability—AZ mRNA was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase using EcoRI-digested pGEM-AZΔT205. The reaction mixture for AZ synthesis (0.02 ml) contained 30 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.6, 10 μm hemin, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1.0 mm ATP, 0.4 mm GTP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 3 μg of creatine kinase, 0.015 A260 units of AZ mRNA, 0.4 MBq of [35S]methionine with 1 μm methionine, 30 μm concentrations each of the 19 other common amino acids, 0.2 mm spermidine, various concentrations of MgCl2 shown in Fig. 2B, and 10 μl of Sephadex G-25-filtered rabbit reticulocyte lysate (0.85 mg of protein) (37Ogasawara T. Ito K. Igarashi K. J. Biochem. 1989; 105: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After incubation at 33 °C for 60 min, 5 μl of 20 mm methionine and 75 μl of the buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS were added to the reaction mixture. The amount of [35S]methionine-labeled AZ synthesized was determined by SDS/PAGE after immunoprecipitation according to the method of Philipson et al. (38Philipson L. Andersson P. Olshevsky U. Weinberg R. Baltimore D. Gesteland R. Cell. 1978; 13: 189-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) using an antibody against AZ and PANSORBIN cells (Calbiochem). Radioactivity of labeled AZ was quantified using a Fujix BAS 2000II imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). Degradation of AZ was measured according to the method of Mamroud-Kidron et al. (39Mamroud-Kidron E. Omer-Itsicovich M. Bercovich Z. Tobias K.E. Rom E. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (0.14 ml) contained 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.05 μg/ml creatine kinase, 1 μm cycloheximide, 20 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (37Ogasawara T. Ito K. Igarashi K. J. Biochem. 1989; 105: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled AZ synthesized as described above in the presence of 0.2 mm spermidine and 1.25 mm MgCl2. At the designated time a remaining [35S]methionine-labeled AZ in a 25-μl aliquot was measured as described above. Measurement of Polyamines—Polyamine contents in NIH3T3, FM3A, and human embryonic lung WI-38 cells were determined as described previously (40Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Hamasaki H. Miura A. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Matsuzaki S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Polyamines in the supernatant were measured by using a TOSOH HPLC system (Tosoh, Tokyo). The precipitate was used to determine the protein content (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans and Analysis of Disaccharides in Heparan Sulfate in NIH3T3, FM3A, and Human Embryonic Lung WI-38 Cells— Heparin (HP; average Mr 16,000) and heparan sulfate (HS; average Mr 15,000) from porcine intestinal mucosa were purchased from Celsus. NIH3T3, FM3A, and human embryonic lung WI-38 cells were lyophilized to dryness. Approximately 2 mg of lyophilized sample of whole cells was homogenized with 1.0 ml of acetone. The precipitate obtained by centrifugation was homogenized again with acetone and centrifuged. After the precipitate was kept in 1.0 ml of 0.5% SDS, 0.1 m NaOH, and 0.8% NaBH4 for 16 h at room temperature with constant stirring, 200 μl of 1 m sodium acetate and 300 μl of 1 m HCl were added. The solution was filtered, and 200 μl of 1 m HCl was added to the filtrate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 7 ml of ethanol was added to the supernatant and chilled for 2 h at 0°C, and the crude glycosaminoglycan fraction was collected by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in 0.3 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and the solution was applied to an Ultrafree-MC DEAE membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl and filtrated. The fractions eluted with 1.0 m NaCl in the same buffer were collected, desalted with Biomax-5 (Millipore), evaporated, and resuspended in 12 μl of water for heparin lyase digestion. Then 5 μl of 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 7.0, with 10 mm calcium acetate and 15 μl of heparin lyase mixture (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) consisting of heparin lyase I (1 mIU), heparin lyase II (1 mIU), and heparin lyase III (heparitinase) (1 mIU) were added to a 5-μl portion of sample. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and an 8-μl aliquot was used for the analysis by HPLC. Unsaturated disaccharides produced enzymatically from HS were determined by a reversed phase ion-pair chromatography with sensitive and specific post-column detection (42Toyoda H. Yamamoto H. Ogino N. Toida T. Imanari T. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 830: 197-201Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A gradient was applied at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min on Senshu Pak Docosil (4.6 × 150 mm; Senshu Scientific, Tokyo, Japan) at 55 °C. The eluents used were as follows: A, H2O; B, 0.2 m sodium chloride; C, 10 mm tetra-n-butylammonium hydrogen sulfate; D, 50% acetonitrile. The gradient program was as follows: 0–10 min, 1–4% eluent B; 10–11 min, 4–15% eluent B; 11–20 min, 15–25% eluent B; 20–22 min, 25–53% eluent B; 22–29 min, 53% eluent B. The proportions of eluent C and D were constant at 12 and 17%, respectively. To the effluent were added aqueous 0.5% (w/v) 2-cyanoacetamide solution and 0.25 m NaOH at the same flow rate of 0.35 ml/min by using a double plunger pump. The mixture passed through a reaction coil (diameter, 0.5 mm; length, 10 m) set in a temperature controlled bath at 125 °C and a following cooling coil (diameter, 0.25 mm; length, 3 m). The effluent was monitored fluorometrically (excitation, 346 nm; emission, 410 nm). The following standard unsaturated disaccharides from HS were purchased from Sigma: 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hexenepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔUA-GlcNAc), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔUA-GlcNS), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-threo-hexenepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose (ΔUA-GlcNAc6S), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔUA2S-GlcNAc), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose (ΔUA-GlcNS6S), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔUA2S-GlcNS), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose (ΔUA2S-GlcNAc6S), and 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose (ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S). Expression of 29- and 24.5-kDa AZs—It has been reported that two kinds of AZ (29 and 24.5 kDa) are synthesized from a single AZ mRNA containing two initiation codons (Fig. 1A) (30Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). AZ could not be detected by Western blotting in most of normal cells because it is present at only very low levels; therefore, so it was studied using ODC-overproducing EXOD-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, 24.5-kDa AZ was the predominant species in EXOD-1 cells. One reason for this is that only the second, not the first initiation, codon AUG has an optimal Kozak sequence (31Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). To study the function of both the 29- and 24.5 kDa isoforms, the nucleotide sequence around the first initiation codon was changed to an optimal Kozak sequence, and the levels of the two AZs in NIH3T3 cells were evaluated after transient transfection of the modified AZ gene. In parallel, the level of expression of AZ in NIH3T3 cells transfected with AZ containing only one initiation codon AUG (AZΔAUG1 and AZΔAUG2) (Fig. 1A) was also evaluated. There is a mitochondrial targeting signal between the two initiation codon AUGs, and it is suggested that some 29-kDa AZ is located in mitochondria (43Mitchell J.L. Judd G.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, the two AZs were measured in the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions. In untransfected NIH3T3 cells, the level of AZs could not be detected (Fig. 1B). Thus, only expression of AZ by transient transfection could be observed in NIH3T3 cells. If an optimal Kozak sequence was introduced around the first initiation codon AUG, expression of 29 kDa AZ was higher than that of 24.5 kDa AZ, and a portion of 29-kDa AZ, but not 24.5-kDa AZ, was associated with mitochondria (Fig. 1B). This was also the case when 29-kDa AZ encoded by AZΔAUG2 mRNA was expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Because the amount of protein in mitochondria was about 4% of the cytoplasmic protein, ∼4–10% of 29-kDa AZ was located in mitochondria. This is similar to the percentage of 29-kDa AZ located on mitochondria, as determined in another study using immunofluorescence microscopy (44Gondre S. Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Mitochondrion. 2003; 2: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When 24.5-kDa AZ encoded by AZΔAUG1 mRNA was expressed in NIH3T3 cells, it was mainly located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). Next, it was investigated whether 24.5-kDa AZ is the main AZ in NIH3T3 cells as in the case of ODC-overproducing EXOD-1 cells (Fig. 1B). When the nucleotide sequence around the first initiation codon was returned to the original suboptimal Kozak sequence (Fig. 1A), 24.5-kDa AZ was the main AZ form synthesized (Fig. 2A). Spermidine was also strongly involved in the preferential recognition of the second initiation codon AUG. When AZ was synthesized from AZΔT205 mRNA having a Kozak sequence around the first AUG using a rabbit reticulocyte polyamine-free lysate, 0.2 mm spermidine together with 1.25 mm MgCl2 (close to the physiological concentration of Mg2+) enhanced the synthesis of 24.5-kDa AZ (Fig. 2B). If AZ synthesis was studied in the presence of Mg2+ but not spermidine, preferential synthesis of 29-kDa AZ was observed (data not shown). Another factor that influences the predominant presence of 24.5-kDa AZ is thought to be its stability relative to the 29-kDa AZ (45Mitchell J.L. Judd G.G. Leyser A. Choe C. Biochem.

As shown in Fig. 2C, 24.5-kDa AZ was far more stable than 29-kDa AZ. Our results indicate that the predominance of 24.5-kDa AZ is due to the preferential synthesis of 24.5-kDa AZ and its greater stability compared with 29-kDa AZ.

https://openalex.org/W1995067668,"Steroid auto-regulation of the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) 1A promoter in lymphoblast cells resides largely in two DNA elements (footprints 11 and 12). We show here that c-Myb and c-Ets family members (Ets-1/2, PU.1, and Spi-B) control hGR 1A promoter regulation in T- and B-lymphoblast cells. Two T-lymphoblast lines, CEM-C7 and Jurkat, contain high levels of c-Myb and low levels of PU.1, whereas the opposite is true in IM-9 B-lymphoblasts. In Jurkat cells, overexpression of c-Ets-1, c-Ets-2, or PU.1 effectively represses dexamethasone-mediated up-regulation of an hGR 1A promoter-luciferase reporter gene, as do dominant negative c-Myb (c-Myb DNA-binding domain) or Ets proteins (Ets-2 DNA-binding domain). Overexpression of c-Myb in IM-9 cells confers hormone-dependent up-regulation to the hGR 1A promoter reporter gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that hormone treatment causes the recruitment of hGR and c-Myb to the hGR 1A promoter in CEM-C7 cells, whereas hGR and PU.1 are recruited to this promoter in IM-9 cells. These observations suggest that the specific transcription factor that binds to footprint 12, when hGR binds to the adjacent footprint 11, determines the direction of hGR 1A promoter auto-regulation. This leads to a ""molecular switch"" model for auto-regulation of the hGR 1A promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1996995584,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are key events during embryonic development and cancer progression. It has been proposed that Src plays a major role in some EMT models, as shown by the overexpression of viral Src (v-Src) in epithelial cells. It is clear that Src family kinases can regulate the integrity of both adherens junctions and focal adhesions; however, their significance in EMT, especially in the physiological context, remains to be elucidated. Here we showed that Src is activated in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-mediated EMT in mammary epithelial cells and that the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1, prevents EMT. However, neither a more specific Src family kinase inhibitor, SU6656, nor a dominant-negative Src inhibited TGF-β1-mediated EMT, leading us to speculate that Src activation is not an essential component of TGF-β1-mediated EMT. Unexpectedly, PP1 prevented Smad2/3 activation by TGF-β1, whereas SU6656 did not. Most interestingly, an in vitro kinase assay showed that PP1 strongly inhibited the TGF-β receptor type I, and to a lesser extent, the TGF-β receptor type II. Taken together, our data indicated that PP1 interferes with TGF-β1-mediated EMT not by inhibiting Src family kinases but by inhibiting the Smad pathway via a direct inhibition of TGF-β receptor kinase activity.

EMTs play crucial roles both in embryonic development and in cancer progression (1Gotzmann J. Mikula M. Eger A. Schulte-Hermann R. Foisner R. Beug H. Mikulits W. Mutat.

A number of in vitro model systems have been developed to study EMT, and many cellular changes that accompany EMT have been described, including actin reorganization, dissolution of cell-cell junctions, induction of focal adhesions, and increased cell motility (5Boyer B.

The model system we have used previously in our laboratory and continue to use for these studies is the mouse mammary epithelial cell line, NMuMG, which undergoes EMT in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (7Maeda M.

In particular, TGF-β signaling plays a dual role in cancer progression. It functions as a growth suppressor in normal epithelial cells, and thus, TGF-β receptors are considered to be tumor suppressors. However, in some tumor cells, TGF-β has a tumor-promoting effect, which contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis. This tumor-promoting effect of TGF-β signaling is thought to be related to its ability to induce EMT (11Akhurst R.J. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S44-S51PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 12Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 13Wakefield L.M.

There is evidence that TGF-β induces EMT via the Smad pathway in injury-induced EMT in lens epithelium and in NMuMG cells (15Itoh S. Thorikay M. Kowanetz M. Moustakas A. Itoh F.

However, this latter finding is controversial since Bhowmick et al. (18Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) suggested that TGF-β-mediated EMT is independent of the Smad pathway. Indeed, several non-Smad pathways, including those involving Rho, Ras, Type 2 protein serine/threonine phosphatase, and TGF-β-activated kinase 1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (TAK1/MEKK1), have been reported to be downstream of TGF-β receptors (19Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). TGF-β-mediated EMT is one of the best-studied in vitro models of EMT and thus has been used in many studies focusing on defining the mechanisms that mediate the phenotypic changes associated with EMT. Thus, far, several downstream pathways, including RhoA (18Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1155-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), have been implicated in TGF-β-mediated EMT. One characteristic event in TGF-β-mediated EMT is the formation of focal adhesions, where various tyrosine kinases and their substrates reside. One such kinase is the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src, a mediator of signal transduction that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration (27Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 114-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 28Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 29Frame M.C. Fincham V.J.

It has been shown that c-Src is involved in the turnover of focal adhesions and also in disruption of adherens junctions (32Fincham V.J. Frame M.C.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Furthermore, v-Src and an active mutant of c-Src induce EMT in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and KMC12C colon cancer cells, respectively (36Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F.

Given the discrepancies in the literature, the role Src plays in TGF-β-mediated EMT has yet to be elucidated, and even whether its activation is necessary for EMT remains unclear. Here we used the NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cell model system to rule out a central role for Src activity in TGF-β1-mediated EMT.

Extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). In some experiments, SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) was used for extraction followed by sonication, and the protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described (43Johnson K.R. Lewis J.E. Li D. Wahl J. Soler A.P. Knudsen K.A. Wheelock M.J. Exp.

Cells were examined on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope (Göttingen, Germany) equipped with an ORCA-ER digital camera (Hamamatsu, Houston, TX). Images were collected and processed using OpenLab software from Improvision Inc. (Boston, MA). In Vitro Protein Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays were done essentially as described (50Eyers P.A.

The carboxyl-terminal fragments (nucleotides 449–1519 of TGF-β type I receptor and nucleotides 880–2007 of the TGF-β type II receptor) were amplified by PCR, subcloned into the TOPO TA cloning system, and moved into pGST-Parallel-1 vector (52Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of the carboxyl-terminal residues of TGF-β receptor type I and type II for expression in Escherichia coli. PCR products were sequenced and shown to encode the wild type amino acid sequence. Logarithmically growing E. coli (JM109; Promega, Madison, WI) transformed with pGST-parallel recombinants were incubated with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 15 h at 23 °C. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with glutathione-agarose and gently shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), the GST fusion proteins were eluted with wash buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. The kinase reactions for TGF-β type I and type II receptors were carried out in 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (MP Biomedicals, Irvine CA), 2 pmol of TGF-β type I or type II receptor protein, and serial concentrations of PP1 at 30 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the reaction mixture was mixed with SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The 32P signals corresponding to autophosphorylated TGF-β receptors were analyzed by autoradiography, and the inhibitory effects of PP1 were measured as a decrease in autophosphorylation of the receptors. Autoradiographic films were quantified by densitometry using Adobe® PhotoShop® histogram. The Src Inhibitor PP1 Prevents TGF-β1-mediated EMT in NMuMG/E9 Cells—In this study, we used NMuMG/E9 cells, which are a clone of the NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cell line. The E9 clone was established in our laboratory and has a highly epithelial morphology (7Maeda M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation level of a known autophosphorylation site in the activation loop of mouse c-Src (Tyr-418, using the initiating methionine as amino acid 1) is correlated with its enzymatic activity (53Hunter T. Cell. 1987; 49: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Analysis using anti-phospho-specific antibody (p418Y of c-Src) demonstrated that phosphorylation of c-Src at Tyr-418 was elevated by TGF-β1 treatment in NMuMG/E9 cells, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by 10 μm Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor PP1 (Fig. 1, A and B). The total c-Src level was slightly elevated upon TGF-β1 treatment. The increase is likely regulated at the post-transcriptional level since no increase in c-Src mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in TGF-β1-treated NMuMG/E9 cells (Fig. 1D). Immunostaining using anti-phospho-specific antibody (p418Y of c-Src) showed that activated c-Src was translocated to newly formed focal adhesions in TGF-β1-treated NMuMG/E9 cells, where it co-localized with paxillin, a marker of focal adhesions (Fig. 1C). These data indicated that c-Src was activated by TGF-β1 in NMuMG/E9 cells. To investigate the significance of Src activation in TGF-β1-mediated EMT in NMuMG/E9 cells, we asked whether the SFK inhibitor PP1 would prevent not only Src activation but also EMT itself in NMuMG/E9 cells. In a previous report (54Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 50 nm PP1 failed to prevent EMT in TGF-β1-treated NMuMG cells. We confirmed this finding by showing that in our system, 1 μm PP1 did not show any effect on the cells (data not shown). However, 10 μm PP1 did significantly inhibit EMT in our system. We have previously shown that TGF-β1 treatment of NMuMG/E9 cells induced expression of N-cadherin, Snail, and SIP1 mRNA (7Maeda M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Here we show that PP1 pretreatment inhibited the induction of each of these genes (Fig. 1D). In addition, TGF-β1 treatment induced formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions and dissolution of cell-cell junctions in NMuMG/E9 cells, and these effects were also abrogated by 10 μm PP1 (Fig. 2). Moreover, at the protein level, PP1 inhibited the induction of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and fibronectin and the reduction of the epithelial marker ZO-1 (see Figs. 4 and 6).FIGURE 4SU6656 did not interfere with TGF-β1 induced EMT. A, NMuMG/E9 cells pretreated with Me2SO (DMSO)(a and b), 10 μm PP1 (c and d), or 10 μm SU6656 (e and f) were incubated with (b, d, and f) or without (a, c, and e) TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 1 day and observed by phase contrast microscopy. Photographs of living cells were taken using a ×10 dry objective; bar = 50 μm. B, TNE extracts of these cells were immunoblotted for phospho FAK (p FAK), total FAK, phospho Src (Tyr-418) (p c-SrC (418Y)), total Src, N-cadherin, fibronectin, and GAPDH. C, immunoblots were quantified and normalized to GAPDH from three independent experiments and graphed showing the standard deviation. SU6656 prevented Src activation, and thus phosphorylation of FAK by Src, but failed to interfere with induction of N-cadherin and fibronectin or with the morphological changes occurring in response to TGF-β1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Inhibition of c-Abl did not interfere with TGF-β1-mediated EMT.

To confirm that c-Src functioned in the cellular context of TGF-β1-mediated EMT, we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation level of known c-Src substrates, including FAK, paxillin, and p120 catenin, in the absence or presence of PP1 pretreatment. Tyr-397 of FAK is a major autophosphorylation site that provides a docking site for the SH2 domain of Src family kinases (55Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 56Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Tyr-577 of FAK, which is located in the kinase domain, is phosphorylated by Src (57Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the elevation of FAK protein level by TGF-β1, immunoblots using phospho-specific antibodies revealed that TGF-β1 treatment significantly raised the phosphorylation level on Tyr-577 and slightly raised the phosphorylation level on Tyr-397 (Fig. 3, A and B). PP1 treatment strongly inhibited phosphorylation of Tyr-577, which is a consensus Src phosphorylation site. However, phosphorylation at Tyr-397, which is an autophosphorylation site rather than a Src site, was not significantly changed (Fig. 3, A and B). When the Src substrate, paxillin, is phosphorylated, it migrates more slowly on SDS-PAGE; thus, we can get an indication of the phosphorylation status of paxillin from immunoblots of total cell lysates. Phosphorylation of paxillin was up-regulated in the presence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 3C, arrow), and this was diminished by PP1 (Fig. 3C, left panel). To confirm that paxillin was phosphorylated on tyrosine, we immunoprecipitated cell extracts with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) and blotted back with anti-paxillin (Fig. 3C, right panel). Indeed, PP1 inhibited phosphorylation of paxillin. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies against p120 catenin, another Src substrate, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) showed that p120 catenin was also tyrosine phosphorylated by TGF-β1 treatment of NMuMG/E9 cells and that PP1 also inhibited its phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). Thus, the results shown in Fig. 3 clearly demonstrate that TGF-β1 treatment induced c-Src activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of known c-Src substrates and that PP1 treatment interfered with phosphorylation of each of these substrates. These data point out: 1) that c-Src is activated when NMuMG/E9 cells undergo EMT in response to TGF-β1; 2) that a number of known Src substrates that are thought to be involved in the biological changes cells undergo during EMT are phosphorylated in response to TGF-β1-induced EMT in NMuMG/E9 cells; and 3) that the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1, inhibits TGF-β1-induced EMT and inhibits phosphorylation of the relevant Src kinase substrates. More Specific Src Inhibitors Do Not Interfere with TGF-β1-mediated EMT—The above data suggested that Src activation was necessary for TGF-β1-mediated EMT in NMuMG/E9 cells. However, some recent reports have shown that PP1 is not entirely specific for Src family kinases and is able to inhibit other kinases such as c-Abl and platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor (PDGFRβ) (58Tatton L.

The ActVB component is a NADH:flavin oxidoreductase that provides a reduced FMN to the second component, ActVA the proper monooxygenase. In this work, we demonstrate that the ActVA-ActVB system catalyzes the aromatic monohydroxylation of dihydrokalafungin by molecular oxygen. In the presence of reduced FMN and molecular oxygen, the ActVA active site accommodates and stabilizes an electrophilic flavin FMN-OOH hydroperoxide intermediate species as the oxidant. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that the quinone form of dihydrokalafungin is not oxidized by the ActVA-ActVB system, whereas the corresponding hydroquinone is an excellent substrate. The enantiomer of dihydrokalafungin, nanaomycin A, as well as the enantiomer of kalafungin, nanaomycin D, are also substrates in their hydroquinone forms.

There is general agreement that the reaction proceeds through an oxidation of the flavin by molecular oxygen to generate a flavin hydroperoxide intermediate (21Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Valentine J.S. Foote C.S. Greenberg A. Liebman J.F. Active Oxygen in Biochemistry. Blackie Academic and Professional, Glasgow, Scotland, UK1995: 37-83Crossref Google Scholar). This is followed by transfer of a single oxygen atom from the electrophilic peroxide to the substrate, generating the oxidized product of the reaction (21Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Valentine J.S. Foote C.S. Greenberg A. Liebman J.F. Active Oxygen in Biochemistry. Blackie Academic and Professional, Glasgow, Scotland, UK1995: 37-83Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore in this two-component system, NAD(P)H oxidation and the hydroxylation reaction are catalyzed by separate polypeptides. In all cases, with the exception of luciferase (22Jeffers C.E. Nichols J.C. Tu S.-C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), there is no evidence for an interaction between the two components and a channeling mechanism allowing the flavin to travel from one protein to another within a protein complex. Accordingly, in most cases, the oxidoreductase component can be replaced by other flavin reductases, including the non-homologous ones from other organisms (4Kirchner U. Westphal A.H.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7509-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The flavin transfer process from the oxidoreductase to the oxygenase is thus simply under thermodynamic control (5Louie T.M. Xie X.S. Xum L.

Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that the DHK substrate appears to be utilized in its hydroquinone form and the only product formed is hydroxylated DHK. Although this enzyme system (or at least ActVB) was originally proposed to be involved in the dimerization to form actinorhodin (23Cole S.P. Rudd B.A. Hopwood D.A. Chang C.J. Floss H.G. J. Antibiot.

Anaerobic experiments were performed at 18 °C in a Jacomex glove box equipped with a UV-visible cell coupled to an Uvikon XL spectrophotometer by optical fibers (Photonetics system). All the solutions were incubated anaerobically for 2 h before the beginning of each experiment. Deoxygenated stock solutions (500 μm) of FMN (ϵ445 nm = 12.5 mm–1 cm–1), NNM-A, NNM-D, and DHK were anaerobically photoreduced in the presence of 0.5 μm deazaflavin and 10 mm EDTA by irradiation for 30 min using a commercial slide projector placed at a distance of 3 cm. The reduced solutions were used within 1 day. With Reduced Pyronaphthoquinone Substrates—10 μm FMNred was first mixed in the anaerobic glove box with 10 μm reduced pyronaphthoquinone and 50 μm ActVA into a 100-μl air-tight spectrophotometric cuvette. The oxidation was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of pure oxygen-saturated water (1 mm O2) with a Hamilton syringe. The reaction was followed by UV-visible spectroscopy. At the end of the reaction, the mixture was immediately analyzed by HPLC-MS as described below. With Oxidized Pyronaphthoquinone Substrates—Various amounts of pure oxygen-saturated water (1 mm O2) were added to an air-tight microvial (150 μl) containing 100 μm oxidized pyronaphthoquinone (final concentration) to a final volume of 100 μl. Oxygen final concentrations ranging between 28 and 90 μm were obtained with this procedure. In the anaerobic glove box, 10 μl of this mixture was injected with a Hamilton syringe into an air-tight spectrophotometric cuvette containing 100 μl of 10–20 μm FMNred and 50 μm ActVA solution. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically. At the end of the reaction, the mixture was analyzed and quantified by HPLC as described below. In the Absence of Pyronaphthoquinone Substrate—Under aerobic conditions, ActVB (155 nm) was added to a mixture containing 200 μm NADH, 46 or 80 μm FMN, 0 to 104 μm ActVA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically at 25 °C. In the Presence of Oxidized Pyronaphthoquinone Substrate—Under aerobic conditions, ActVB (155 nm) was added to a mixture containing 200 μm NADH, 4 μm FMN, 36 μm oxidized pyronaphthoquinone substrate (DHK or NNM-A), 0 to 180 μm ActVA in a 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer. The reaction was followed by UV-visible spectrophotometry at 25 °C. The appearance of the hydroxylated product was monitored at 520 nm and also analyzed by HPLC-MS as described below. Similar experiments were performed with successive additions of NADH (200 μm) to obtain a total hydroxylation of the pyronaphthoquinone substrates. The steady-state kinetic parameters of the nanaomycin A reductase activity of ActVB were determined in the anaerobic glove box at 18 °C, by monitoring the quinone reduction at 423 nm (ϵ423 nm = 4.0 mm–1 cm–1). Under standard conditions, the reaction mixture contained 200 μm NADH, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and various amounts of NNM-A, in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of an ActVB solution containing 34 nm FMN (final concentration). Initial velocities were determined from the early linear part of the reaction progress curves and plotted as a function of NNM-A concentrations. Data were fitted according to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm of Kaleidagraph®. 10 μm FMNred was mixed in an anaerobic glove box with 28 μm ActVA and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer at 18 °C. A deoxygenated DHKox solution was then added rapidly with a Hamilton syringe to a final concentration of 10 μm and the reaction was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. HPLC analyses were performed with a 1100 Agilent chromatographic system coupled to a diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer. An aliquot fraction (100 μl) of the reaction mixture was diluted two times with an aqueous solution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to being loaded onto a C18 column (previously equilibrated with 65% of ultrapure water and 35% of acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Elution was conducted with a 35–100% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) linear gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/min during 10 min and monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry between 250 and 900 nm. Pyronaphthoquinone substrates and hydroxylated products were then quantified from the integration of the HPLC peak monitored at 423 and 520 nm, respectively. HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry analyses were performed with a 1100 Agilent chromatographic system coupled to an API 3000 triple quadripolar apparatus (Applied Biosystem/SCIEX) equipped with a turbo ionspray electrospray source used in the negative mode. Samples were loaded onto a 2 × 150-mm octadecylsilyl silica gel (5 μm particle size) column (Uptisphere, Interchim Montluçon, France) previously equilibrated with 65% ultrapure water containing 2 mm ammonium formate and 35% acetonitrile. Elution was carried out with a 35–100% acetonitrile linear gradient in 2 mm ammonium formate as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 200 μl/min during 10 min. Mass analyses were performed in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. For this purpose, fragments corresponding to the decarboxylated ([M–44–H]) pseudomolecular ions were quantified. The transitions corresponding to pyronaphthoquinone, hydroxylated pyronaphthoquinone, and actinorhodin were monitored simultaneously with a dwell time set at 650 ms for each compound. The ActVA-ActVB System in the Absence of Pyronaphthoquinone Substrates: Evidence for a Flavin Hydroperoxide Intermediate under Steady-state Conditions—In the experiments described below, the complete flavin reductase (ActVB)-monooxygenase (ActVA) system was investigated in the absence of pyronaphthoquinone substrates under aerobic ([O2] = 200 μm) steady-state conditions. An excess of ActVA with regard to both ActVB and FMN was used to ensure that the reduced flavins (FMNred) produced by the action of ActVB/NADH were fully trapped within ActVA polypeptide chains (in agreement with the previously determined Kd values for FMNred with regard to ActVA and ActVB, 0.39 and 6.60 μm, respectively (20Valton J. Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Nivière V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44362-44369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, the FMN concentration was such that the ActVB enzyme was saturated (Km value for FMNox = 1 μm (6Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Nivière V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). The reaction could be monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy because both NADH and FMN are characterized by specific light absorption bands in the 300–500-nm region. NADH (200 μm) oxidation was monitored at 340 nm, whereas FMNox reduction was followed at 445 nm. The results are shown in Fig. 1. During the first step of the aerobic incubation, we observed an oxidation of NADH (decrease of the intensity of the 340-nm band) that stopped (plateau of the intensity at 340 nm) after ∼100 s, when all NADH was consumed (Fig. 1A). During the first 100 s, FMNox was transformed (decrease of the intensity at 445 nm) almost quantitatively into a species whose concentration remained constant (plateau at 445 nm) as long as NADH was present in solution (Fig. 1A). During this steady-state, FMN was mostly in a state displaying a single absorption band at 370 nm in the UV-visible spectrum (the slight absorption above 450 nm corresponds to the residual FMNox form), characteristic for a flavin-hydroperoxide species (21Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Valentine J.S. Foote C.S. Greenberg A. Liebman J.F. Active Oxygen in Biochemistry. Blackie Academic and Professional, Glasgow, Scotland, UK1995: 37-83Crossref Google Scholar), FMN-OOH (Fig. 1B, squares). After the 100-s reaction, when all NADH was oxidized, the flavin was slowly and totally converted back to FMNox, as shown from the increase of the intensity of the 445-nm absorption band (Fig. 1, A and B). From Fig. 1A, a first-order rate constant of k = 0.84 min–1 was determined for the decomposition of the FMN-OOH species. This process (100–359-s reaction time) occurred without any absorbing intermediate species, because spectral changes involved three isosbestic points at 333, 365, and 399 nm (Fig. 1B). Note that the first spectrum at 76 s does not share all these isosbestic points because it also contains absorption at 340 nm because of residual NADH. This experiment showed that, in the absence of substrate and under the reductive pressure of NADH, the intermediate FMN-OOH is present in aerobiosis under large steady-state concentrations and is thus spectrophotometrically observable. The same type of experiment was carried out with various concentrations of ActVA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the steady-state level of FMN-OOH, reflected by the plateau of the optical density at 445 nm (reaction time 50–100 s), increased with increased ActVA concentration. The amount of FMNox converted to FMN-OOH was determined from the A at 445 nm using the difference between its value at the end of the reaction (t > 350 s) and its value at the plateau (t = 50 s), assuming negligible contribution of the FMN-OOH species at this wavelength. It should be noted that in these conditions free FMNred does not accumulate because it is immediately oxidized by excess O2. Plotting this value as a function of ActVA concentration generates a straight line, indicating that FMN-OOH accumulation is directly proportional to the ActVA concentration. The slope in Fig. 2B gives the amount of FMN-OOH formed per ActVA molecule. The results demonstrated that under the experimental conditions used here, one molecule of FMN-OOH was formed per dimer of ActVA, at the steady state. The ActVA-ActVB System in the Presence of Pyronaphthoquinone Substrates: a Monooxygenation Reaction—The substrate of the enzyme system is presumed to be DHK (Schemes 1 and 2). However, enzymatic oxidation of DHK has not been shown in vitro. When DHK (36 μm) was incubated aerobically with the ActVA-ActVB system in the presence of 4 μm FMN and 200 μm NADH in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, a product was formed at the expense of DHK, as shown by HPLC. No product could be obtained in the absence of ActVA (data not shown). Fig. 3A shows the chromatogram detected at the end of the reaction when all NADH has been oxidized (100 s). DHK is eluted at 7.4 min and the product at 7.7 min. The spectrum of the product is shown in Fig. 3B (triangles). The absorption band enjoys a large bathochromic shift with regard to that of DHK, from 423 to 507 nm, and is significantly different from that of actinorhodin. The ϵ values have been estimated as described below. Analysis of the new compound by LC-MS demonstrated that its mass differed from that of DHK by only one oxygen atom (m/z = 317 Da instead of 301 Da for DHK). This result showed that the product of the reaction in vitro was not actinorhodin (m/z = 633 Da), but rather a monooxygenated derivative of DHK, named DHK-OH in the following.FIGURE 3ActVA-ActVB hydroxylase activity: identification of the hydroxylated product by HPLC-MS and UV-visible spectroscopy. 4 μm FMNox was aerobically incubated with 50 μm ActVA, 155 nm ActVB, 36 μm DHK, 200 μm NADH in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, at 25 °C. A, the reaction mixture was analyzed after 100 s by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring mode set up to analyze DHK and DHK-OH mass in a negative mode.

The ϵ values of the latter were determined from the steady-state experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the experiment of Fig. 3, using 200 μm NADH, DHK (36 μm initial concentration) was only partially converted to DHK-OH, as monitored by HPLC. We thus carried out several reaction runs by repeated additions of 200 μm NADH and oxygen until all the DHK was oxidized to product. From one run to the following the spectrum did not change in shape and the area of the peak corresponding to DHK-OH increased by about the same extent to reach a plateau when all DHK was oxidized. Assuming that the only oxidation product under these conditions was DHK-OH and that conversion of DHK to DHK-OH was quantitative, one thus could determine the extinction coefficient for DHK-OH at 507 nm, with a value of 4.4 mm–1 cm–1 (as compared with 0.27 mm–1 cm–1 for DHK). This extinction coefficient of the band at 520 nm for DHK-OH was comparable with that of the band at 423 nm for DHK. This was also observed for quinone analogs such as 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, which display visible spectra remarkably similar to those of DHK and DHK-OH, respectively (26Khan M.S. Khan Z.H. Spectrochimica Acta Part A Mol. Spectrosc. 2005; 61: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was clear that the reaction yield, calculated as the amount of DHK-OH divided by the amount of consumed NADH (200 μm) during the first run, was low. This yield increased with increased ActVA concentration but leveled off at about 10% with the highest concentrations (Fig. 4). The dependence of the yield on FMN concentration was also studied and showed that the optimal concentration of FMN was 4 μm, using 37 μm ActVA (data not shown). The same complete study, involving product characterization (UV-visible spectroscopy and mass spectrometry) and calculation of reaction yields, was carried out with NNM-A as a substrate (data not shown). NNM-A is the enantiomer of DHK (Scheme 2). As for DHK, only one monooxygenated product was obtained. Fig. 4 shows the dependence of the yield of NNM-A oxygenation upon ActVA concentration, demonstrating that it is a poorer substrate. Taken together, these results indicated a very inefficient coupling of ActVB (flavin reduction) and ActVA (monooxygenation) activities. A possible source of uncoupling was the unproductive reaction of free FMNred with molecular oxygen during flavin transfer from ActVB to ActVA. However, as a large excess of ActVA was used in our experiments to ensure fast and complete binding of FMNred, this factor is unlikely to be a significant contribution to the uncoupling. Another possible source of uncoupling was identified as described below. Quinone Reductase Activity of the ActVA-ActVB System—Reduced flavins are excellent reducing agents with regard to a variety of electron acceptors such as oxygen, ferric complexes, and also quinones (27Gaudu P. Touati D. Nivière V. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8182-8188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. J. Biol.

We thus suspected the quinone compounds (DHK and NNM-A) used as substrates of the ActVA-ActVB system to be reduced by the FMNred generated by ActVB. Indeed, free FMNred, obtained through ActVB flavin reductase activity or through anaerobic irradiation in the presence of deazaflavin, was shown to quantitatively reduce NNM-A, as shown from the intensity of the final band at 353 nm, characteristic of its hydroquinone form (data not shown). We also investigated the quinone reductase activity of an ActVB preparation containing a tightly bound FMN (29Filisetti L. Valton J. Fontecave M. Nivière V. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2817-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in the absence of free flavin. To avoid competition with molecular oxygen, all the experiments were carried out within an anaerobic glove box. When 200 μm NADH was incubated with ActVB containing 34 nm FMN bound, in Tris buffer, pH 7.6, no oxidation of NADH could be detected. Addition of a quinone substrate such as NNM-A in this medium resulted in its fast reduction by NADH, as shown by the decrease of the intensity of the 423 nm absorption band characteristic for the quinone. Fig. 5A shows the initial and final UV-visible spectrum in an experiment with NADH (200 μm) in excess with regard to the quinone (130 μm). At the end of the reaction, there is no more quinone as shown from the lack of the band at 423 nm. The absorption band at around 350 nm is a mixture of a band at 340 nm (residual NADH) and a new band at 353 nm, characteristic of the corresponding NNM-A hydroquinone (30Tanaka H. Minami-Kakinuma S.

Nuclear translocation of NF-κB is regulated from the cytoplasm by IκB kinase-β (IKKβ), which earmarks inhibitors of NF-κB for polyubiquination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Activation of IKKβ is contingent upon signal-induced phosphorylation of its T loop at Ser-177/Ser-181. T loop phosphorylation also renders IKKβ a substrate for monoubiquitination in cells exposed to chronic activating cues, such as the Tax oncoprotein or sustained signaling through proinflammatory cytokine receptors. Here we provide evidence that the T loop-proximal residue Lys-163 in IKKβ serves as a major site for signal-induced monoubiquitination with significant regulatory potential. Conservative replacement of Lys-163 with Arg yielded a monoubiquitination-defective mutant of IKKβ that retains kinase activity in Tax-expressing cells but is impaired for activation mediated by chronic signaling from the type 1 receptor for tumor necrosis factor-α. Phosphopeptide mapping experiments revealed that the Lys-163 → Arg mutation also interferes with proper in vivo but not in vitro phosphorylation of cytokine-responsive serine residues located in the distal C-terminal region of IKKβ. Taken together, these data indicate that chronic phosphorylation of IKKβ at Ser-177/Ser-181 leads to monoubiquitin attachment at nearby Lys-163, which in turn modulates the phosphorylation status of IKKβ at select C-terminal serines. This mechanism for post-translational cross-talk may play an important role in the control of IKKβ signaling during chronic inflammation.

Initiation of the genetic programs for inflammation and immunity is mediated in part by the inducible transcription factor NF-κB (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasmic compartment by virtue of its association with the labile inhibitor IκBα or other structurally related proteins (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Biological inducers of NF-κB include proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), 4The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factor-αIKKIκB kinaseTNF-R1TNF receptor type 1UbubiquitinHAhemagglutininNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPVDFpolyvinylidine difluorideUDubiquitination-defectivePPphosphopeptidesRIPreceptor-interacting proteinMAPmitogen-activated protein. the lipopolysaccharide component of Gram-negative bacteria, and the Tax oncoprotein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (3Sun S.C.

Cellular stimulation with these agents leads to activation of a multicomponent kinase called IKK, which phosphorylates IκBα at Ser-32/Ser-36 (6Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). In turn, the phosphorylated Ser-32/Ser-36 motif docks with a specific ubiquitin (Ub)-protein ligase complex, resulting in Ub conjugation at nearby Lys-21/Lys-22 (7Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitinated IκBα is then degraded by the 26 S proteosome, enabling NF-κB to translocate to its nuclear site of action (6Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

The capacity of IKK to integrate a wide spectrum of activating cues has evoked significant interest in its structure, function, and signal-dependent regulation (8Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). The IKK holoenzyme is composed of α and β catalytic subunits, both of which contain kinase, leucine zipper, and helix-loop-helix domains (9Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). IKKβ is primarily responsible for phosphorylation of IκBα in vivo, whereas IKKα targets distinct cellular substrates in an alternative pathway for NF-κB induction (10Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). Activation of IKKβ by TNF, Tax, and other inducers of NF-κB is triggered by phosphorylation of this kinase at Ser-177/Ser-181 (11Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 12Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These phosphoacceptors lie in a region of the catalytic domain that shares homology with the regulatory T loop sequences found in mitogen-activated protein kinases and their upstream activators (11Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of IKKβ (amino acids 670-705) harbors a second set of TNF-inducible phosphoacceptors whose precise function remains unclear relative to Ser-177/Ser-181 (11Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Prior studies suggest that modification of the T loop and C-terminal phosphoacceptors is mediated by IKKβ itself (11Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 13Tang E.D. Inohara N. Wang C.Y. Nunez G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38566-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Signal-induced phosphorylation and activation of IKKβ are critically dependent upon its association with a noncatalytic subunit termed IKKγ/Nemo (9Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Activated IKKβ also phosphorylates IKKγ, which may serve to amplify IKK signaling (12Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M.

More recent studies indicate that IKKβ and IKKγ are substrates not only for phosphorylation but also for ubiquitination, although to different extents. Specifically, IKKγ is polyubiquitinated during the cellular response to microbial products, proinflammatory cytokines, antigen receptor agonists, and genotoxic stress (16Burns K.A. Martinon F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1040-R1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This modification is dependent on the C-terminal zinc finger domain of IKKγ, a frequent target for mutations that can impair NF-κB signaling and cause human immunodeficiency disease (17Tang E.D. Wang C.-Y. Xiong Y. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37297-37305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18Courtois G. Smahi A. Israel A. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast to IKKγ, IKKβ is conjugated to a single Ub unit under conditions of chronic stimulation via the Tax oncoprotein or the type 1 receptor for TNF (TNF-R1) (19Carter R.S. Pennington K.N.

Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 286: 149-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitin attachment is contingent upon T loop phosphorylation at Ser-177/Ser-181 and disrupted in cells expressing YopJ, a Ub-like protein protease that interferes with IKK/NF-κB signaling (19Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48903-48906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the underlying targeting mechanism and regulatory potential of IKKβ monoubiquitination remain unknown. In this study, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that chronic phosphorylation of IKKβ at Ser-177/Ser-181 leads to ligation of monoubiquitin at the T loop-proximal residue Lys-163. Replacement of Lys-163 with Arg yields a ubiquitination-defective mutant that is resistant to chronic activation mediated by TNF-R1. This functional defect is not apparent in cells expressing the Tax oncoprotein, suggesting an agonist-specific requirement for monoubiquitination. We also provide evidence that monoubiquitin attachment at Lys-163 regulates the in vivo phosphorylation status of IKKβ at select TNF-responsive serines located in its C-terminal region (amino acids 670-705) (11Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Comparative studies of in vivo versus in vitro phosphorylated IKKβ suggest that the Ub-dependent serines are targeted by a kinase other than IKKβ itself. Taken together, our findings indicate that IKKβ is regulated by a novel mechanism involving post-translational cross-talk between monoubiquitination and phosphorylation. This mechanism may play an important role in the acquisition of a deregulated IKKβ phenotype during chronic inflammation (21Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar).

For in vitro autophosphorylation of IKKβ, IKKβ immunocomplexes were washed extensively with ELB containing 2 m urea to remove associated proteins and were incubated in GST-IκB substrate-deficient reaction mixtures containing [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) and 2.5 μm ATP. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and analyzed by sequential autoradiography and immunoblotting. Metabolic Radiolabeling and Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping—At 36 h post-transfection, cells were labeled for 6 h with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml; ICN) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech). IKK immunocomplexes were prepared from cytoplasmic extracts using anti-FLAG antibodies coupled to agarose beads. Immunocomplexes were washed with ELB containing 2 m urea and then with RIPA buffer. Phosphoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. Membrane sections containing radiolabeled IKKβ were excised, digested in situ with 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK)-treated chymotrypsin, and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping as described (15Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19642-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Differential Ubiquitination of IKKβ and IKKγ—In prior transfection studies, we found that Tax-induced monoubiquitination of IKKβ is contingent upon the presence of the regulatory subunit IKKγ (19Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48903-48906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the relevant Ub-conjugating machinery can recognize and modify IKKβ within the context of a higher order complex containing IKKγ. To test this model, we determined whether Ub-conjugated forms of IKKβ are associated with IKKγ. For these studies, epitope-tagged versions of the two IKK subunits were coexpressed with Tax in mammalian cells and then immunoprecipitated with epitope-specific antibodies. Resultant complexes were dissociated with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and fractionated by nickel-chelate affinity (Ni-NTA) chromatography to capture His-tagged IKKβ (19Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48903-48906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Ni-NTA eluates were probed on immunoblots (Fig. 1A) for their content of ubiquitinated and phosphorylated IKKβ (top and middle panels, respectively). Both of these species were readily detected in Ni-NTA eluates derived from IKKβ, IKKγ, or Tax immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Parallel fractionation studies with extracts from Tax-deficient cells confirmed the signal-dependent nature of each modification (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 3, and 5). We conclude that IKKγ-bound forms of IKKβ are targeted for monoubiquitination. Emerging studies indicate that IKKγ is polyubiquitinated during the cellular response to TNF, antigen receptor signaling, or genotoxic stress (16Burns K.A. Martinon F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1040-R1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Given our findings that IKKγ-bound forms of IKKβ acquire a different Ub signature (Fig. 1A), we next investigated whether IKKγ is conjugated to polyubiquitin or monoubiquitin in Tax-expressing cells. For these studies, extracts from transfected populations were treated with N-ethylmaleimide to disrupt IKKβ-IKKγ complexes, and then each subunit was isolated by immunoprecipitation (19Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48903-48906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Resultant immunocomplexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and probed for Ub content on immunoblots. As shown in Fig. 1B, Tax stimulated monoubiquitination of IKKβ (lanes 1 and 2), whereas IKKγ was polyubiquitinated in the same cellular background (lanes 3 and 4). In keeping with prior studies of TNF-treated cells (17Tang E.D. Wang C.-Y. Xiong Y. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37297-37305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), removal of the C-terminal zinc finger motif in IKKγ blocked Tax-induced polyubiquitination (data not shown). Thus, ectopically expressed IKKβ and IKKγ are differentially modified with Ub in the presence of Tax, underscoring the subunit-specific nature of the monoubiquitination pathway under investigation. To determine whether these distinct patterns of subunit modification are recapitulated at physiologic substrate levels, we next monitored Tax-induced ubiquitination of endogenous rather than ectopic IKK. As detected on immunoblots with antibodies to the Ub tag (Fig. 1C, top panels), the endogenous pool of IKKβ complexes contained a major immunoreactive species of ∼105 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular size of monoubiquitinated IKKβ (lane 4). Parallel studies with control cells lacking either tagged Ub or Tax confirmed the signal-dependent nature of this modification (Fig. 1C, lanes 1-3). In keeping with the results shown in Fig. 1B, endogenous IKKγ was polyubiquitinated in Tax-expressing cells (Fig. 1C, lane 8). Changes in the ubiquitination pattern could not be attributed to Tax-mediated stabilization or degradation of either IKK subunit (Fig. 1C, lower panels). These data provide direct biochemical evidence for differential ubiquitination of IKKβ versus IKKγ at the endogenous protein level. Lys-163 Is the Primary Ub Acceptor Site in IKKβ—Protein ubiquitination is mediated by the sequential action of at least three enzymes (termed E1, E2, and E3) that together catalyze the activation and ligation of Ub to susceptible lysine residues in a substrate (22Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A prerequisite for understanding the mechanism and functional consequences of IKKβ monoubiquitination is to identify the relevant Tax-responsive acceptor site(s). In this regard, recent structural studies indicate that the spacing between a substrate's inducible phosphorylation motif and its Ub acceptor site is a key determinant of ubiquitination efficiency (23Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In what may be a related observation, we have found that Tax-induced phosphorylation of T loop residues Ser-177/Ser-181 in IKKβ is a prerequisite for its monoubiquitination (19Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48903-48906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These mechanistic results raised the possibility that IKKβ is monoubiquitinated at a Lys residue positioned relatively close to the T loop phosphoacceptors. To identify candidate Ub acceptors, site-directed mutagenesis was used to engineer Arg replacements at each of the 11 Lys residues in the N-terminal kinase domain of IKKβ (Fig. 2A). We then programmed Tax-deficient cells with these IKKβ mutants and monitored their in vivo ubiquitination status by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, all of the kinase constructs were comparably expressed (lower panel). With the notable exception of mutant K171R (Lys-171 → Arg), which was constitutively monoubiquitinated, none of the Lys → Arg mutants of IKKβ were appreciably modified with Ub in Tax-deficient cells (Fig. 2B, top panel). The K171R mutant was also constitutively phosphorylated at T loop residues Ser-177/Ser-181 (data not shown), consistent with our prior studies indicating that the two modifications are linked (19Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48903-48906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were conducted with Tax-expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, Tax induced monoubiquitination of wild type IKKβ (top panel, lane 1), whereas mutants of IKKβ containing Lys → Arg replacements at positions 44, 147, 163, or 238 were significantly impaired for Ub attachment (top panel, lanes 3, 5, 6, and 10). The observed defects in monoubiquitination could not be attributed to Tax-induced changes in IKKβ protein expression (Fig. 2C, middle panel) or varying levels of Tax expression (lower panel). Moreover, mutations that simultaneously disrupted all of the Lys residues located within the leucine zipper, the helix-loop-helix, or the intervening regions of IKKβ were without effect, thus confirming specificity (Fig. 2D). These in vivo findings suggested that the kinase domain of IKKβ contains one or more Ub acceptor sites in addition to its phosphoacceptors at Ser-177/Ser-181. Alternatively, we reasoned that some of the Lys → Arg mutations might inhibit ubiquitination by perturbing the structural and/or functional integrity of the IKKβ kinase domain. To address this possibility, we investigated whether any of the Lys → Arg replacements disrupted the catalytic function of IKKβ.SE, a constitutively active version of IKKβ containing Glu phosphomimetics at Ser-177/Ser-181 (11Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 15Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19642-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For these studies, the IKKβ.SE constructs were produced in 293T cells and then monitored for their capacity to phosphorylate a recombinant IκB substrate in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2E (top panel), IKKβ.SE displayed significant IκB kinase activity as compared with a control construct containing Ala substitutions at Ser-177/Ser-181 (lanes 1 and 2). Introduction of Arg at positions 44, 147, or 238 completely abolished the activity of IKKβ.SE (lanes 3, 4, and 6). In sharp contrast, IκB kinase activity was fully retained following replacement of Lys-163 with Arg (lane 5). Taken together with Fig. 2C, we conclude that the K44R, K147R, and K238R mutations inhibit ubiquitination by perturbing the structural and/or functional integrity of the IKKβ kinase domain, whereas the K163R mutation selectively removes the Ub attachment site. Consistent with this interpretation, subsequent studies confirmed that removal of Lys-163 from IKKβ.SE blocks Ub attachment in vivo (see Fig. 5A). Tax and Proinflammatory Receptors Converge on the Same Ub Acceptor—Similar to the Tax oncoprotein, chronic cellular stimulation through TNF-R1 leads to monoubiquitination of IKKβ (19Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48903-48906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Tax activates the IKK complex via a direct binding mechanism (24Chu Z.-L. DiDonato J.A. Hawiger J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNF-R1 acts indirectly on IKK via intermediate adaptors, such as RIP, which recruit the kinase to the cytoplasmic tail of TNF-R1 (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 5Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). Given these divergent mechanisms of action, we reasoned that Tax and TNF-R1 might target distinct Ub acceptors in IKKβ. To explore this possibility, we transfected 293T cells with expression vectors for IKKβ, IKKγ, and either TNF-R1 or Tax. We then monitored in vivo ubiquitination of IKKβ under each stimulatory condition. As expected, neither wild type IKKβ nor the K163R mutant was monoubiquitinated in the absence of chronic cellular stimulation (Fig. 3, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). In keeping with results shown in Fig. 2C, coexpression with Tax led to persistent monoubiquitination of wild type IKKβ, whereas the K163R mutant was defective for this modification (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Despite the distinct mechanism by which TNF-R1 activates IKK signaling, the pattern of IKKβ subunit ubiquitination induced by TNF-R1 was indistinguishable from that obtained with Tax-expressing cells (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Immunoblotting experiments confirmed that Tax, TNF-R1, and IKK substrate targets were efficiently expressed (Fig. 3, lower panels). These biochemical data suggest that monoubiquitination at Lys-163 is a common post-translational modification step in the mechanism of Tax and TNF-R1 action on IKKβ. Functional Consequences of IKKβ Monoubiquitination—Both Tax and TNF-R1 stimulate the catalytic activity of IKKβ via a mechanism involving phosphorylation of its T loop at Ser-177/Ser-181 (11Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 12Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

In turn, activated IKKβ phosphorylates a set of distinct protein substrates, including the associated regulatory subunit IKKγ and cytoplasmic inhibitors of NF-κB such as IκBα (6Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y.

In QEDH these are Cys105 and Cys106 (16Keitel T. Diehl A. Knaute T. Stezowski J.J. Höhne W. Görisch H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been proposed for the oxidation of alcohols in quinoprotein dehydrogenases, both of which begin with the PQQ in an oxidized state. Initially, an addition/elimination mechanism was proposed, a suggestion that is now considered unlikely; rather, a hydride transfer mechanism is preferred (19Oubrie A. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H.

Nucleophilic attack of the hydride from the substrate to the C-5 position of PQQ then occurs. Subsequently, the PQQ enolizes to form the quinol.

Bruice T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11881-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Duine J.A. Frank J. De Beer R. Arch Biochem.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Oubrie A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although a deprotonated radical was recently postulated (33Sato A. Takagi K. Kano K. Kato N. Duine J.A. Ikeda T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the protonation states is crucial if the ET and proton transfer pathways in both reoxidation steps are to be understood, because depending on the protonation states of the initial and final molecules, the reaction is either simple ET or must be accompanied by the release of a proton. Furthermore, apart from the driving force and the reorganization energy, according to ET theory (34Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7801) Google Scholar), the rate of ET is dependent on the electronic coupling between the donor (PQQ) and acceptor (heme). Therefore, a full understanding of ET kinetics in quinoproteins will only be possible with knowledge of both the spatial and electronic structures of the ET partners (35Davidson V.L. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 428: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The latter may be provided by electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) via determination of hyperfine couplings (hfcs) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations (36Büttner T. Geier J. Frison G. Harmer J. Calle C. Schweiger A. Schonberg H. Grützmacher H. Science. 2005; 307: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These methods enable us to establish that the PQQ radical is deprotonated when bound in QEDH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the light of this finding, we present here a revised reaction cycle for PQQ-dependent dehydrogenases. Enzyme Isolation—The apoform of QEDH enzyme was heterologously over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described earlier for holoQEDH (37Rupp M. Görisch H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Kay C.W.M. Mennenga B. Görisch H. Bittl R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the Holoform of QEDH—The formation of an enzymatically active holoenzyme in either protiated or deuteriated buffer was achieved as described previously (39Mutzel A. Görisch H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 1721-1726Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Before reconstitution, the enzyme was transferred to the appropriate buffer (protiated or deuteriated) by ultrafiltration using Centricon filters with a 30-kDa cut-off (Millipore, Billerica, MA). PQQ (Sigma) was dissolved in the same buffer. In a previous study we observed that following reconstitution or isolation of the native enzyme, substrate is often bound (40Kay C.W.M. Mennenga B. Görisch H. Bittl R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 7974-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, following reconstitution the preparations were washed by repeated ultrafiltration cycles in freshly prepared alcohol-free protiated or deuteriated buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2). Finally, the samples were concentrated to a subunit concentration of 300 μm. EPR Sample Preparation—The enzyme preparations were transferred into 3-mm (inner diameter) quartz tubes for X-band (9 GHz) EPR and 0.7-mm (inner diameter) quartz tubes for W-band (94 GHz) EPR. EPR Instrumentation—X-band continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded using a pulsed EPR spectrometer (Bruker Elexsys E580) equipped with an EPR resonator (SHQEW0401) cooled by a helium cryostat (Oxford ESR 910). X-band-pulsed ENDOR spectra were recorded using the same spectrometer together with a DICE-ENDOR accessory including a radiofrequency amplifier (Amplifier Research 250A250A) and a dielectric ring ENDOR resonator (Bruker EN4118X-MD-4-W1), which was immersed in a helium gas flow cryostat (Oxford CF-935). For Davies-type ENDOR, a microwave pulse sequence π-t-π/2-τ-π using 64- and 128-ns π/2 and π pulses, respectively, and a radiofrequency pulse of 10 μs duration, starting 1 μs after the first microwave pulse, were used. The separation times t and τ between the microwave pulses were selected to be 13 μs and 500 ns, respectively. W-band-pulsed ENDOR spectra were recorded using a pulsed EPR spectrometer (Bruker Elexsys E680) equipped with a DICE-ENDOR accessory including a radiofrequency amplifier (Amplifier Research 250A250A) and an ENDOR resonator (Bruker Teraflex EN600–1021H), which was immersed in a helium gas flow cryostat (Oxford). For Davies-type ENDOR, a microwave pulse sequence π-t-π/2-τ-π using 120- and 240-ns π/2 and π pulses, respectively, and an RF pulse of 20 μs duration, starting 1 μs after the first microwave pulse, were used. The separation times t and τ between the microwave pulses were selected to be 25 μs and 600 ns, respectively. All experiments were performed at 80 K. The pulse patterns were repeated with a frequency of 200 Hz so as to avoid saturation effects due to long relaxation times. Note that as no modulation was used, the ENDOR spectra are in absorption. To increase signal-to-noise and to aid interpretation and discussion, the ENDOR spectra have been symmetrized with respect to the nuclear Zeeman frequency. They are displayed on an hfc axis centered at the nuclear Zeeman frequency. Computations—DFT was used to calculate the geometric and electronic structure of PQQ in several oxidation and protonation states. Geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory, as implemented in the program package Gaussian 03 (41Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R.

For closed shell and radical species, restricted and unrestricted calculations, respectively, were performed. Single point calculations of isotropic and dipolar hfcs were carried out on the optimized geometries. Graphical representations of molecular orbitals and electron spin density surfaces were achieved using the Molden program package (42Schaftenaar G. Noordik J.H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2000; 14: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar) followed by rendering with POV-Ray™. EPR—The X-band cw-EPR spectrum of the PQQ radical bound in QEDH is shown in Fig. 2 (continuous line). The spectrum shows a slightly asymmetric line shape centered at giso = 2.0043 and a peak-to-peak line width of 0.5 millitesla and is similar to that observed in MDH (3Duine J.A. Frank J. Westerling J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 43de Beer R. van Ormondt D. van Ast M.A. Banen R. Duine J.A. Frank J. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 70: 4491-4495Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Westerling J. Frank J. Duine J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), s-GDH (33Sato A. Takagi K. Kano K. Kato N. Duine J.A. Ikeda T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and QH-EDH (45de Jong G.A. Geerlof A. Stoorvogel J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Typical of all of the EPR spectra is the shoulder at low field and the ease of microwave saturation. When the enzyme was reconstituted in deuteriated buffer, the peak-to-peak line width was reduced only slightly, but the shoulders decreased in relative intensity (Fig. 2, dotted line). The narrow line width of both spectra and the absence of dramatic changes when comparing the two samples are qualitative evidence that the exchangeable protons have only small hfcs. Hence, to garner more specific details about the protonation state of the PQQ radical, we have turned to the higher resolution of ENDOR. ENDOR—X-band-pulsed ENDOR spectra of the PQQ radical bound in QEDH and reconstituted in protiated buffer and deuteriated buffer are displayed in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. The ENDOR spectra are centered at the nuclear Zeeman frequency (νH = 14.75 MHz), and in the weak coupling limit, which is the case here, each set of equivalent protons gives rise to a pair of tensorial patterns, whereby the splitting is equal to the hfc component (Fig. 3A). To aid comparison, the spectra have been normalized so that the outer shoulder and peak (in the range of νH ± 6 to 10 MHz), which appear to be almost unaffected by changes in the buffer, have the same intensity. The spectrum from QEDH reconstituted in protiated buffer exhibits a very rich and well resolved hyperfine structure with hfcs in the range of 0 to 10 MHz. When the enzyme was reconstituted in deuteriated buffer, there was a dramatic reduction in intensity in the middle part of the spectrum. The difference between the spectra recorded in deuteriated buffer and protiated buffer is shown in Fig. 3C. The difference spectrum gives us a high degree of confidence that the exchangeable protons have hfcs in the range of 0 to 5 MHz, one of which is expected to be the proton at N-1. The protonation states of the three carboxylic acid groups of PQQ when bound in quinoproteins are not known, although in solution at pH 7 it is expected that they would be deprotonated (33Sato A. Takagi K. Kano K. Kato N. Duine J.A. Ikeda T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 46Kano K. Mori K. Uno B. Kubota T. Ikeda T. Senda M. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1990; 24: 193-201Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, even if they were protonated, such protons always have negligible hfcs. The only other positions in the cofactor that could have exchangeable protons with significant hfcs are at O-4 and O-5. Other contributions can arise from exchangeable protons such as water molecules, in the binding pocket, and nearby amino acids such as Arg344. The spectrum from the sample reconstituted in deuteriated buffer (Fig. 3B) should contain only nonexchangeable protons, of which the PQQ cofactor has two, at C-3 and C-8. Indeed, outside of the matrix region (>2 MHz), two tensorial patterns are discernable. One has rhombic symmetry and components at 9.6 and 6.2 MHz, whereas the third and smallest component is smaller and hidden. The second has a narrow and intense component at 4.0 MHz, which implies axial symmetry, although the other component cannot be positively identified. The matrix region (<2 MHz) shows an intense signal and some structure, but it cannot be easily interpreted. We expect that it is due in part to the β-protons on the cysteine residues forming a disulfide bridge that is in van der Waals contact with the PQQ cofactor. To gain a more complete understanding of the spectrum containing only nonexchangeable protons, we performed pulsed ENDOR experiments at W-band. The improved spectral resolution provided by the increased Zeeman interaction allows us to measure ENDOR spectra with orientation selection. Fig. 4 shows the X-band ENDOR spectrum (A) together with the W-band spectra (B, C, and D) of the same sample recorded at magnetic field positions in the W-band EPR spectrum at which principal values of the g-tensor are on resonance. The W-band EPR spectrum and principal values of the g-tensor have been published previously and are not repeated here (40Kay C.W.M. Mennenga B. Görisch H. Bittl R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 7974-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The advantage of W-band ENDOR over conventional X-band ENDOR is immediately apparent. The powder-type X-band spectrum is separated into three more simple spectra. The most straightforward ENDOR spectrum to interpret is that with the magnetic field parallel to gz (Fig. 4D). Given that the PQQ cofactor is approximately planar, an assumption that all x-ray data and quantum mechanical calculations support, then as in all quinoids, gz is expected to be perpendicular to the molecular frame. Hence, only molecules with their planes perpendicular to the external magnetic field are on resonance at this position. Therefore, only the component of the hfc tensor that is perpendicular to the molecular plane is detected. For the C-3 and C-8 α-protons of PQQ, this is the middle hfc component, and indeed, the spectrum recorded at gz shows two intense transitions, with hfcs Azz of 6.2 and 4.0 MHz, which are also observed at X-band. The spectrum recorded at gy (Fig. 4C) also shows two distinct, albeit broader transitions: a large hfc with a maximum at 9.6 MHz and a smaller hfc of 4.1 MHz. Again, these can be associated directly with the equivalent transitions in the X-band spectrum. In the spectrum taken at gx (Fig. 4B), all large hfcs have vanished and only a single pair of lines with a hfc of 2.6 MHz is observed outside the intense matrix region. On the flanks of the matrix region is another pair of lines with a hfc of 1.6 MHz. Taking all this information together, we obtain, for two nonexchangeable protons, one symmetric rhombic tensor with components Axx = 2.6 MHz, Ayy = 9.6 MHz, Azz = 6.2 MHz and one almost axial tensor with components Axx = 1.6 MHz, Ayy = 4.1 MHz, Azz = 4.0 MHz. The experimental values are collected in Table 1. In previous Q-band ENDOR studies on MDH, the two quite similar Azz components were determined: Azz,1 = 6.6 MHz and Azz,2 = 4.1 MHz in Rhodopseudomonas acidophila (47de Beer R. Duine J.A. Frank J. Large P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 622: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and Azz,1 = 6.3 MHz and Azz,2 = 3.7 MHz in Hyphomicrobium X (43de Beer R. van Ormondt D. van Ast M.A. Banen R. Duine J.A. Frank J. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 70: 4491-4495Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The comparison shows that the electronic structure of the PQQ radical in MDH and QEDH is quite similar, so that we expect that the results obtained here should be generally applicable to this class of enzymes.TABLE 1Comparison of experimental and calculated proton hfcs for the PQQ radical bound in QEDHProtonExperimental values for QEDH from P. aeruginosaCalculated valuesAnion radical Ca2+PQQ4·¯Neutral radical Ca2+PQQ(4)H3·¯Neutral radical Ca2+PQQ(5)H3·¯N-1 A1<5-4.88-3.21-1.50 A2<5-4.13-1.800.34 A3<50.243.170.99C-3 Ayy(-)4.1-3.62-1.35-24.12 Azz(-)4.0-3.550.92-18.10 Axx(-)1.6-1.011.99-5.18O-4 A1-3.17 A2-2.08 A31.55O-5 A1-1.68 A2-0.73 A30.60C-8 Ayy(-)9.6-11.11-5.35-1.07 Azz(-)6.2-7.06-3.78-0.15 Axx(-)2.6-1.63-0.731.10 Open table in a new tab Quantum Mechanical Calculations—To assign the hfcs we carried out DFT calculations on the PQQ radical. The ground state oxidized PQQ was taken as PQQ3– with all three carboxyl groups deprotonated in line with spectroelectrochemical studies (33Sato A. Takagi K. Kano K. Kato N. Duine J.A. Ikeda T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 46Kano K. Mori K. Uno B. Kubota T. Ikeda T. Senda M. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1990; 24: 193-201Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), an approach that has been included in recent quantum chemical calculations (48Jongejan A. Jongejan J.A. Hagen W.R. J. Comput. Chem. 2001; 22: 1732-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 49Reddy S.Y. Bruice T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15887-15892Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hence, formally the one-electron reduced PQQ radical has the structure PQQ4·¯. Previous quantum mechanical calculations have shown that the binding of Ca2+ has very little effect on the geometry of PQQ (30Zheng Y.-J. Bruice T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11881-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as it is present in all quinoproteins, it was also included here giving Ca2+PQQ4·¯ as the anion radical form. The literature portrays two possible neutral radical forms, Ca2+PQQH3·¯ with the PQQ protonated at either O-4, Ca2+PQQ(4)H3·¯, or O-5, Ca2+PQQ(5)H3·¯ (see Fig. 1). We take the anion and neutral nomenclature from the flavin literature. The predicted hfc parameters for the protons are collected in Table 1. All three structures converged, and apart from the carboxylic group at C-9, which was slightly twisted to form a better hydrogen bond with the proton at N-1, the geometries were approximately planar, in agreement with previous work (30Zheng Y.-J. Bruice T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11881-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 48Jongejan A. Jongejan J.A. Hagen W.R. J. Comput. Chem. 2001; 22: 1732-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, it is not our purpose here to discuss all the details of the structures; rather we have concentrated on comparing the experimental and theoretical hfcs. Ca2+PQQ(4)H3·¯ and Ca2+PQQ(5)H3·¯ are structural isomers, and therefore we can compare their energies directly. The total energy of Ca2+PQQ(5)H3·¯ is 71 kJ mol–1 more unfavorable than Ca2+PQQ(4)H3·¯. The coordinate bond from O-H to Ca2+ is clearly weaker than that from O– to Ca2+. The hfcs of Ca2+PQQ(4)H3·¯ are all small, whereas Ca2+PQQ(5)H3·¯ has one very large hfc for the proton at C-3. The hfcs of neither isomer match the experimental data. The calculations for Ca2+PQQ4·¯ predict two medium-sized hfcs for the nonexchangeable protons. The tensor of the proton bound at C-8 is larger and has a rhombic shape, whereas that at C-3 is smaller and axial. The magnitudes and symmetries match the experimental data rather well (see Table 1). Furthermore, the hfc tensor components for the proton at N-1 are all under 5 MHz, which is what we expected from the H2O/D2O buffer exchange experiments. Similar results were obtained from calculations in which all three carboxylic acid groups were protonated (not shown). The good agreement between theory and experiment establishes that the PQQ radical in QEDH is deprotonated at O-4 and O-5, as was recently suggested for the PQQ radical in s-GDH (33Sato A. Takagi K. Kano K. Kato N. Duine J.A. Ikeda T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To summarize, we have shown that the PQQ radical in QEDH is well described by a Ca2+PQQ4·¯ complex and now will consider the implications of this result for the reaction mechanism (Fig. 5). Panel I (Fig. 5) shows the molecular structures that are active or potentially active in each step, and panel II shows the molecular orbitals of these species. The oxidation of the radical species (Fig. 5E) Ca2+PQQ4·¯ to the oxidized species (Fig. 5A) Ca2+PQQ3– is a simple ET to cytochrome. The singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) for the Ca2+PQQ4·¯ complex derived from DFT calculations is presented in Fig. 5E, panel II. It has a highly localized electron density concentrated on the central ring with a maximum at C-5 and appears designed to have optimal overlap with the orbitals of the sulfur of the nearby Cys106 (4 Å above C-5), thus promoting electron transfer to the electron acceptor via the disulfide bridge. We optimized the structure of the oxidized species, Ca2+PQQ3–, and have displayed the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in Fig. 5A, panel II. The loss of one electron in comparison with the radical species has only a small effect on the electronic structure. The minor changes to the orbital imply that there will be only minimal electronic reorganization accompanying the ET, thus enhancing the rate. Furthermore, the LUMO of the oxidized PQQ has the proper form, maximum electron density at C-5, to act as hydride acceptor during alcohol oxidation. Following this reaction, reduced PQQ is formed. The protonation state of this species when bound in the protein is not known, although it is usually depicted as the quinol, PQQH2, protonated at both O-4 and O-5. Nevertheless, there does not seem to be any reason why the two protons liberated during the oxidation of ethanol should not be immediately released (see Fig. 1). This is particularly true for the proton abstracted from the alcohol by the amino acid base, Asp or Glu, which does not have to be transferred to the PQQ. On the other hand, the intermediate PQQ species formed by hydride addition to C-5 does provide a proton that could relocate to O-4 by enolization. Indeed, Arg344, which is located close to O-4 and O-5, provides a positive charge that could balance a negatively charged reduced PQQ. For comparison, a negatively charged reduced form is common in flavoproteins, i.e. FADH–. This reasoning led us to perform DFT calculations on the possible protonation states of the reduced species shown in Fig. 5: protonated at both O-4 and O-5, Ca2+PQQH3–2 (B); singly protonated at O-4 or O-5, Ca2+PQQH4– (C); deprotonated, Ca2+PQQ5– (D). The step to form the radical Ca2+PQQ4·¯ (Fig. 5E) depends on the nature of the reduced species. The simplest reaction would be a straightforward ET from Ca2+PQQ5– to cytochrome. If we start out from Ca2+PQQH4–, then the ET must be accompanied by the loss of a proton, and from Ca2+PQQH23- by the loss of two protons. We have optimized the geometry of the deprotonated reduced species, Ca2+PQQ5–, and display the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in Fig. 5D. The addition of one electron to the radical species has some effect on the orbital with a markedly reduced electron density on N-1 and C-3. Nevertheless, it still has a high electron density at C-5 close to the cysteinyl sulfur for optimal orbital overlap and efficient ET to cytochrome, and thus this structure is a good candidate for the reduced species. ET concomitant with proton release to generate the Ca2+PQQ4·¯ radical from the reduced Ca2+PQQH4– is certainly possible, but again it is important to know the electron density distribution in the HOMO. Hence, we have optimized the geometries of the two isomers. As in the radical, the protonation of O-5 appears to be very unfavorable, and the species protonated at O-4 is 84 kJ mol–1 more stable. The HOMO of this species is displayed in Fig. 5C. Its electron density distribution is also quite similar to that of the radical Ca2+PQQ4·¯ (Fig. 5E), with good overlap with the disulfide bridge, and therefore this structure is also a good candidate for the reduced species. Given the high energetic cost of protonating the reduced species at O-5, it seems implausible that a doubly protonated Ca2+PQQH23- (Fig. 5B) would be an active intermediate. Furthermore, formation of the Ca2+PQQ4·¯ radical from Ca2+PQQH23- by ET accompanied by the loss of two protons also appears unlikely, but as it is the standard structure given in the literature we also considered this possibility. We have optimized the structure and display the HOMO in Fig. 5B, panel II. The protonation of O-5 has a dramatic effect, in that the HOMO now has almost no electron density on the central ring; rather, this is concentrated on the carboxylic group at C-2. The orbital overlap with the disulfide bridge is now very much lower, so that a reduced species with this structure would not be expected to be a good electron donor via the disulfide bridge pathway. Furthermore, the electronic reorganization following ET is now significant, which can only diminish the rate. The clear finding is that in the reduced species O-5 is not protonated. Rather, this species is either deprotonated (Fig. 5D) or, in concurrence with one review article (21Duine J.A. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 1999; 88: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and our chemical intuition, is singly protonated at O-4 (Fig. 5C). We favor the latter proposition, not only because this species is less highly charged but also because, in this case, the two protons liberated during the reaction cycle are released sequentially and not simultaneously. The first proton is released by the Asp or Glu during alcohol oxidation. This negates the need for the complex schemes often introduced to bring the proton abstracted by the amino acid base onto the PQQ. The second proton is released during the first step of PQQ reoxidation. The advantage of this scheme is that the proton flux produced by the enzyme is distributed over both halves of the reaction cycle. Conclusions—hfcs calculated with DFT for a deprotonated radical complexed with a calcium ion, formally Ca2+PQQ4·¯ (Fig. 5E), are in good agreement with the experimental values. This agreement led us to present a model for the SOMO of the radical species that has highest electron densities at O-4, C-5, and O-5 on the central ring. This result is a beautiful example of the theory of orbital steering (50Mesecar A.D. Stoddard B.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1997; 277: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), as this orbital in its guises as SOMO (in the radical form) and LUMO (in oxidized form) has optimal spatial form to function in twin roles, as acceptor for a hydride transfer from substrate and as electron donor with good overlap with the orbitals of the disulfide bridge, thus promoting ET to cytochrome and reoxidation of the PQQ. Hence, these results support the proposed hydride transfer mechanism and an ET pathway via the disulfide bridge. For the reduced PQQ, energetics and the character of the HOMO clearly indicate that O-5 is deprotonated. We suggest that reduced PQQ is singly protonated at O-4 (Fig. 5C), although a doubly deprotonated species (Fig. 5D) cannot be entirely excluded. Although the EPR spectrum of the PQQ radical bound in MDH was first observed many years ago (3Duine J.A. Frank J. Westerling J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), its nature has only now been correctly determined, and in the meantime the wrong structure has been used as a basis for mechanistic discussions. The actual structure of the PQQ radical bound in a quinoprotein and our suggestion for the structure of the reduced PQQ species provide a corrected reaction scheme in which electron and proton transfer pathways may be examined meaningfully. We hope that this contribution will encourage the use of the appropriate spectroscopic and theoretical techniques alongside x-ray crystallography to elucidate reaction mechanisms in full. The results are a salutary reminder that although protons are not usually observed in x-ray structures, they should not be neglected, as together with electrons, they are the moving parts of the enzymatic machine."
https://openalex.org/W2009141115,"We describe two homologues of the mammalian divalent metal transporter (DMT1) for Schistosoma mansoni, a pathogenic intravascular parasite of humans. Schistosomes have a high nutritional and metabolic demand for iron. Nucleotide sequences of the parasite homologues, designated SmDMT1A and -B, are identical in all but the 5′-regions. The predicted amino acid sequences share at least 60% identity with DMT1 (=Nramp2) of humans, mice, and rats, and at least 55% identity with Nramp1 from mice, humans and Caenorhabditis elegans. SmDMT1A is expressed in differentiating eggs, miracidia, cercariae, schistosomula, and adults, whereas SmDMT1B is expressed in all but the miracidium and occurs at lower levels than SmDMT1A in differentiating eggs and cercariae. An iron-responsive element, present at the 3′-untranslated region of many DMT1 molecules, is not present in schistosome mRNAs studied here. A Western blot analysis of adult worm preparations using a homologous rabbit serum raised against a schistosome DMT1 peptide and a heterologous serum raised against mammalian DMT1, revealed a band approximating 115 kDa. By immunofluorescence microscopy, the schistosome DMT1s localize primarily to the tegument. Iron uptake assays demonstrated that SmDMT1s were able to rescue yeast growth in ferrous iron-transport deficient yeast (fet3fet4). The results suggest that schistosomes express molecules for ferrous iron transport in their tegument, suggesting trans-tegumental transport as one means of iron acquisition for these parasites.

Schistosomes are platyhelminth parasites of humans, responsible for significant disease in many tropical countries. Adult schistosomes inhabit the portal blood system of their hosts, where they feed extensively on the hemoglobin from host erythrocytes as the primary protein source. Female schistosomes have been recorded to imbibe up to 330,000 erythrocytes/h, equivalent to a daily intake of 0.88 μl of blood, whereas males imbibe only 39,000 cells/h (1Lawrence J. J. Parasitol. 1973; 59: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes are digested within the gastrodermis by a series of extracellular cytolytic and specific proteolytic enzymes that catabolize hemoglobin to dipeptides or free amino acids for absorption by the gastrodermal syncytium (1Lawrence J. J. Parasitol. 1973; 59: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 2Brindley P.J. Kalinna B.H. Wong J.Y. Bogitsh B.J. King L.T. Smyth D.J. Verity C.K. Abbenante G. Brinkworth R.I. Fairlie D.P.

Parasitol. 1986; 61: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin is a rich source of amino acids, but heme, its catabolic by product, is potentially toxic to the parasites and is polymerized into hematin prior to egestion. The heme-bound iron, which accounts for much of the iron present in schistosome tissues, is thus egested from the body of the worms without absorption into somatic tissues. Iron is a trace element, essential in a wide variety of metabolic activities including immunological resistance, oxidative metabolism, and biomineralization (4Aisen P. Enns C. Wessling-Resnick M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 940-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 5Crichton R.R. Charloteaux-Wauters M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 485-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A surplus of iron in organisms has potentially lethal effects (6Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar), because the element can induce the formation of toxic hydroxyl radicals that damage lipid membranes, proteins, and DNA (7Frazer D. Anderson G.

Drug. Metab. Rev. 1988; 19: 283-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Schistosome tissues are iron-rich, and much of this abundance can be attributed to heme and heme polymers present in the gastrodermal lumen as by-products of hemoglobin digestion. In addition to this gut store, female schistosomes express a vitelline cell-specific ferritin molecule, which presumably provides iron for embryogenesis (10Dietzel J. Hirzmann J. Presis D. Symmons P. Kunz W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In mammals, ferrous ions are absorbed across the intestinal brush border by a divalent metal transporter (DMT1), 4The abbreviations used are: DMT, divalent metal transporter; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; IRE, iron-responsive element; UTR, untranslated region. 4The abbreviations used are: DMT, divalent metal transporter; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; IRE, iron-responsive element; UTR, untranslated region. a member of the highly conserved Nramp (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) family (11Mims M.P. Prchal J.T. Hematology. 2005; 10: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nramp proteins have a wide range of functions in eukaryotes but are primarily involved in trans-membrane transport of divalent metals. DMT1 is an integral membrane transporter containing 10–12 transmembrane domains (7Frazer D. Anderson G. Hematology. 2001; 6: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 11Mims M.P. Prchal J.T. Hematology. 2005; 10: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and can accept a broad range of transition metal ions, among which Fe2+ is transported with high affinity (11Mims M.P. Prchal J.T. Hematology. 2005; 10: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that because schistosomes have large tissue stores of iron (13Schussler P. Potters E. Winnen R. Bottke W. Kunz W. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and live in an iron-rich environment, it was probable that the parasites have pathways for iron acquisition from the bloodstream. Moreover, because Nramp proteins are ubiquitous and highly conserved, we reasoned that a DMT1 homologue is present in these parasites. This paper describes the identification and preliminary characterization of two schistosome DMT1 molecules from Schistosoma mansoni. Parasites—Adult S. mansoni (Puerto Rican strain, both sexes) worms were perfused from BALB/c mice 7–10 weeks after subcutaneous challenge with cercariae and washed thoroughly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Schistosome eggs were isolated from mouse livers (14Dalton J.P. Day S.R. Drew A.C. Brindley P.J. Parasitology. 1997; 115: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and miracidia were hatched in non-chlorinated water from finely diced mouse livers. Cercariae, collected from infected Biomphalaria glabrata snails, were kindly provided by Dr. Fred Lewis (Biomedical Research Institute, Rockville, MD). Degenerate PCR—Degenerate primers were designed from consensus regions identified by alignment of Caenorhabditis elegans (NM_076730), Mus musculus (L33415), Drosophila melanogaster (AY058543), and Homo sapiens (AF046997) DMT1 nucleotide sequences. A nested PCR strategy was employed to amplify schistosome cDNA. The first reaction used a previously constructed S. mansoni adult λ-ZAP cDNA library as template and degenerate primers P23F 5′-ATGWSCATWGCSTAYYTRGAYCCHGGHAAYAT and P1274R 5′-AGDBCSVRWGCARBCARVCA in conditions specified for use with Amplitaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The second PCR was performed using 1 μl of PCR product as template and the nested degenerate primers P250F 5′-GCYGWDCCRATRACYTCYKGCAT and P600R 5′-GACTTRACYAARGCDGAATGCA. PCR parameters were as follows: 95 °C of denaturation for 1 min, 50–65 °C of primer annealing for 1 min (melting temperature dependant on primers pairs used), 72 °C of primer extension for 3 min, and cycle for 30 cycles. A final extension of 7 min was performed at 72 °C before storing the samples at 4 °C. PCR products were gel extracted using the QIA-quick® gel extraction and purification kit and cloned into TOPO TA cloning vector pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), and the DNA insert was sequenced. Sequences were compared with those in the GenBank (nr) and dbEST databases using the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Blast program. Gene-specific primers were designed from the resultant sequence and full-length SmDMT1-A and -B sequences were obtained using cDNA generated by the GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen). Molecular Phylogeny—To demonstrate the similarities among related Nramp sequences from a diversity of organisms, a phylogenetic tree was constructed from inferred amino acid sequences. A variety of vertebrate Nramp1 and Nramp2 sequences were selected for inclusion, as well as sequences from several invertebrates (NCBI accession numbers are listed in Fig. 1B). No full-length Nramp sequences are available from any species of parasitic or free-living platyhelminth, other than S. mansoni. However, the trace archive at NCBI contains data from a whole genome shotgun sequencing project for the free-living triclad planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. This archive was searched, using as the query nucleotide sequences from the most conserved portions of the Nramp genes of S. mansoni. Several exons of the triclad homolog were thus identified. By extending the search in 5′- and 3′-directions, most of the triclad gene was eventually obtained. The entire genomic sequence for the gene was not obtained because of the presence of very long introns. ClustalW (15Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar) was used to align the sequences. Only sites for which data were available for S. mediterranea (374 sites) were included in the analyses. All sites in which an alignment gap occurred in any sequence were omitted from the analysis. Trees were constructed in MEGAv3.0 (16Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief. Bioinf. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10625) Google Scholar) using the minimum evolution method. The substitution model for the tree shown in Fig. 1B was the JTT model. Uniform rates among sites were assumed. The dataset was bootstrapped 1000 times, and resulting values shown on branches of the tree. The tree is midpoint-rooted. Stage-specific Expression of SmDMT1-A and -B—Expression of SmDMT1-A and -B (S. mansoni divalent metal transporter 1 A and B) transcripts in key life cycle stages (male and female adult worms, eggs, cercariae, and miracidia) of the parasite was determined by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from each of the life cycle stages of the parasite using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Single stranded cDNA was generated by priming 1 μg of total RNA with 500 ng of oligo(dt)12–18 random primers (Boehringer, Mannheim) with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Control reactions (without the addition of reverse transcriptase) were included to monitor for contamination with genomic DNA and primers targeting a 291-bp region of the S. mansoni gene encoding triosephosphate isomerase were used to amplify constitutively expressed positive control cDNA (17Hooker C. Brindley P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Specific forward primers for SmDMT1A (5′-ATGCATGTCTGTTTAGATGGAGAGGAAAACGAGGGCAG′) and SmDMT1B (5′-CCACCCTATCGTAATAACATCTTCAGATCATATATATTG) were used with the same reverse primer (5′-CAAAATAGTAATAAGTACACCAGCCCATAA) to amplify 555-bp and 435-bp target fragments, respectively. PCRs were performed on single stranded cDNA as follows: hot start at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min; 55 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min. The products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Antisera—A rabbit antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide (CTREGKIPVR) corresponding to a region of the fourth extracellular loop of schistosome DMT1 (see Fig. 2) and synthesized as a KLH-fusion protein (Sigma Genosys). Prior to use, anti-KLH antibodies were removed from the serum by affinity purification. For this, the serum was passed through KLH-loaded HiTrap-NHS columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sera were tested prior to use for cross-reactivity by PAGE and Western blot analysis (data not shown). A heterologous rabbit antiserum, raised against a 15-amino-acid peptide corresponding to amino acids 230–243 between transmembrane regions 5 and 6 of the rat DMT1 molecule (18Trinder D. Oates P.S. Thomas C. Sadleir J. Morgan E.H. Gut. 2000; 46: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was also used for Western blot analysis and immunolocalization. A membrane extract of adult S. mansoni worms was prepared using the cellular labeling and immunoprecipitation kit (Roche Applied Science), according to manufacturer's instruction. Whole parasite extract was prepared by solubilization of worms as described previously (19Smith A.M. Dalton J.P. Clough K.A. Kilbane C.L. Harrop S.A. Hole N. Brindley P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and denaturation by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min in SDS reducing buffer (Bio-Rad). As a positive control for Western blotting using the heterologous serum, a mouse small intestine extract was added to SDS glycine sample buffer but not denatured. Adult parasite extracts, mouse intestine, and KLH protein (Sigma) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with primary sera diluted at 1:50,000 for SmDMT1-KLH antiserum, 1:5000 for KLH-depleted serum, and 1:1000 for the heterologous serum. Preimmune rabbit sera at equivalent dilutions were used as negative controls. In addition, KLH-reactive fraction of the SmDMT1 sera was used as the control. After incubation with primary sera, the nitrocellulose membranes were washed in 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, Bio-Rad) to detect bound antibodies. For immunofluorescence, unfixed adult S. mansoni worms were snap-frozen in Cryomatrix (ThermoShandon) for cryostat sectioning. All incubations used 2% skim milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline as incubation buffer. Cryosections were incubated with SmDMT1 serum (1:20) or with the heterologous antiserum diluted (1:100 in incubation buffer) followed by goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Cy3 fluorophore (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) (1:500 in incubation buffer). Negative controls were as described for Western blotting (above). Sections were examined and photographed using a Leica DM IRB fluorescence microscope equipped with a Leica DC 500 digital camera. Functional Expression of Schistosome DMT1 cDNAs in Yeast—Both S. mansoni DMT1 sequences were cloned into the NotI site of pFL61 vector (gift of Dr. D. Day, University of Western Australia). The ferrous iron transport-deficient yeast strain DEY1453 (fet3fet4) (20Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) was transformed using lithium acetate-mediated transformation and selected for growth on SD media containing 20 mg ml-1 glucose and appropriate autotrophic requirements and supplemented with FeCl3 to promote growth of yeast (21Kaiser B.N. Moreau S. Castelli J. Thomson R. Lambert A. Bogliolo S. Puppo A. Day D.A. Plant J. 2003; 35: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Complementation experiments were performed following methods of Eide and colleagues (22Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As positive control, Arabidopsis thaliana ferrous iron transporter (AtIRT1), a member of the Nramp family (23Vert G. Grotz N. Dedaldechamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), known from previous yeast complementation assays to be an efficient Fe2+ transporter (21Kaiser B.N. Moreau S. Castelli J. Thomson R. Lambert A. Bogliolo S. Puppo A. Day D.A. Plant J. 2003; 35: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), was used. As negative control, yeast was transformed with empty pFL61 vector. Identification of Two Isoforms of SmDMT1—Degenerate primers were designed from conserved regions of DMT1 amino acid sequences from C. elegans, M. musculus, H. sapiens, and D. melanogaster and used to amplify DNA from an adult S. mansoni cDNA library. Complete sequence data were obtained from the amplification of 5′- and 3′-ends of S. mansoni adult RACE cDNA. SmDMT1-A is a 2249-bp cDNA containing an open reading frame of 583 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 64,130 Da, and SmDMT1-B is a 2084-bp cDNA with a predicted open reading frame of 543 amino acids predicted to encode a 59,730-Da protein. Both cDNAs are identical except for variant N-terminal regions (Fig. 1). The variant region in SmDMT1A consists of 239 bp of unique DNA that is predicted to encode 54 amino acids before the shared sequence begins. The variant region of SmDMT1B is considerably shorter and consists of 81 bp of unique DNA that is predicted to encode 14 amino acids before the shared sequence. In Silico Analysis of SmDMT1—Sequences were compared with those in the GenBank™ and dbEST databases using the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Blast program. The SmDMT1 amino acid sequence shows homology to the Nramp family of functionally related proteins. The members of this family are divalent cation transporters and are defined by a conserved hydrophobic core of 10–12 transmembrane domains. SmDMT1 (excluding the variant 5′-regions) shows strong identity with Nramp2 molecules from human (P49281) 63%, mouse (P49282) 63%, rat (O54902) 63% and D. melanogaster (P49283) 58% (Fig. 2). Identity is also shared with Nramp1 from human (P49279) 61%, mouse (P41251) 59%, and C. elegans (Q21434) 54% with identity to the yeast SMF1 (P38925) and SMF2 (P38778) proteins and manganese transport proteins from bacteria at 30% (figure not shown). Based on sequence comparison and hydropathy plots, SmDMT1 is predicted to contain 12 transmembrane spanning regions, which is characteristic of this family of proteins. In mammals, the biosynthetic rates for both transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferritin are regulated by iron. A highly conserved iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5′-untranslated portion of the ferritin mRNA and the 3′-UTR of mammalian TfR1/mRNA mediates iron-dependent post-transcriptional control of their expression. The IRE functions by forming a specific stem-loop structure that interacts with a transacting factor in an iron-dependent fashion. This element has been reported in the 3′-UTR of human DMT1 sequences (12Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar, 24Lee P.L. Gelbart T. West C. Halloran C. Beutler E. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and follows the 9-nucleotide consensus sequence of 5′-CNNNNNCAGUGN-3′ (25Hentze M.W. Caughman S.W. Casey J.L. Koeller D.M. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The two schistosome transcripts include a conserved polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) 22 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A)+ tail indicating that the full 3′-UTR has been obtained. Analysis of the 3′-UTR of both SmDMT1 revealed a sequence of 5′-AAAUAAACAGUGN-3′. This shared schistosome sequence was identical in all respects to the IRE consensus sequence except for an adenine that replaces the upstream cytosine, that forms the so-named “C” bulge of the consensus IRE. Because the IRE is absolutely conserved (25Hentze M.W. Caughman S.W. Casey J.L. Koeller D.M. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the schistosome sequence is unlikely to function as a regulatory element. In addition, a program designed to analyze sequences for regulatory RNA elements (50Bengert P. Dandekar T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3441-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), including IRE sequence motifs, also failed to recognize any IREs in the 3′ UTR of SmDMT1. All sequences chosen for inclusion in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B) fall into the “archetype” Nramp group (16Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief. Bioinf. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10625) Google Scholar, 26Robledo J.A.F. Courville P. Cellier M.F.M. Vasta G.R. J. Parasitol. 2004; 90: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The flatworm genes clearly fall within this group. The clusters at the top of the tree are vertebrate Nramp1 and Nramp2. Sequences from invertebrates (and plants, yeast, and slime mold) were all very different from each other and from those of vertebrates. Outside the vertebrate clade, almost all bootstrap values were very low indicating poor support for any of the groupings observed (apart from Nramps from the two plant species). An Nramp from the free-living flatworm S. mediterranea fell closest to that of the bivalve mollusk in the tree presented here, but analyses using other models of substitution sometimes provided weak support for a sister group relationship with S. mansoni. Therefore, despite belonging to the same phylum, S. mediterranea and S. mansoni do not resemble one another closely in the sequence of the Nramp gene. Neither has the schistosome sequence converged on the vertebrate sequences, thereby providing little support for a postulate of molecular mimicry by the parasite in the case of Nramp. Stage-specific Expression of SmDMT1-A and -B—RT-PCR amplification of the SmDMT1-A and -B mRNA from different life cycle stages of S. mansoni showed that SmDMT1-A is transcribed in all the stages evaluated. SmDMT1-B is transcribed in comparable amounts in adult male and female worms, to a much lesser extent in cercariae and egg, and is not expressed in the miracidial stage (Fig. 3). PAGE and Western Blotting—Western blot analysis of adult S. mansoni using an antiserum directed against the SmDMT1-KLH fusion peptide recognized a number of bands (Fig. 4A). After KLH-directed antibodies were removed from the serum, the depleted serum recognized a single band of ∼115 kDa (Fig. 4A). An antiserum directed against rat DMT1 also revealed a single diffuse band, representing a protein or aggregate in S. mansoni adult worms at ∼115 kDa in size (Fig. 4B). This latter serum was also used to probe mouse small intestine extract, as was a preimmune serum (Fig. 4B). No bands were identified using the preimmune rabbit serum against mouse small intestine, but the anti-rat DMT1 serum identified a smear spanning 85–90 kDa (Fig. 1A). Mouse DMT1 has been reported to range from 65 to 116 kDa (18Trinder D. Oates P.S. Thomas C. Sadleir J. Morgan E.H. Gut. 2000; 46: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 27Roth J.A.

Blood. 1999; 93: 4406-4417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our results are consistent with these observations. Immunolocalization—Immunofluorescence labeling of adult worm sections with an anti-SmDMT1-KLH fusion protein, the same antiserum from which KLH immunoreactivity had been depleted (anti-SmDMT1), and a heterologous serum raised against rat-DMT1 gave strong positive labeling for the distal cytoplasm of the tegument (Fig. 5, A, B, D, and E). None of these reagents displayed positive immunoreactivity for the gastrodermis of the parasite. The anti-SmDMT1-KLH serum gave a strong positive reaction over the tegument and parenchyma and labeled internal ducts of the parasites (Fig. 5E). Many cross-reactive molecules occur in the parenchyma and excretory ducts of schistosomes but, significantly, not the tegument of adult worms (30Thors C. Linder E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 31Robijn M.L. Wuhrer M. Kornelis D. Deelder A.M. Geyer R. Hokke C.H. Parasitology. 2005; 130: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The KLH-depleted anti-SmDMT1 serum retained positive immunoreactivity for the tegument (Fig. 5D). No reaction was detected in sections labeled with preimmune sera (Fig. 5, C and F) or when primary antiserum was omitted (data not shown). Functional Expression in Yeast—To test whether SmDMT1A and -B could transport Fe2+, these molecules and ArIrt1 were cloned into pFL61 and transformed into DEY1453 iron transport mutant yeast. This strain grows poorly on media with low iron concentrations because high (fet3) and low (fet4) affinity Fe2+ transport has been disrupted (22Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast transformed with ArIrt1 and SmDMT1A and -B grew better than yeast that contained the empty cloning vector (Fig. 6A) on media either lacking or supplemented with 2 μm FeCl3. In liquid SD medium, supplemented with 20 μm FeCl3, cells transformed with ArIrt1 and SmDMT1A routinely entered the exponential growth phase earlier than empty vector or SmDMT1B (Fig. 6B). Despite the slower growth of yeast transformed with SmDMT1B, the cells still entered exponential growth earlier than control cells. We have shown that homologues of the mammalian DMT1 proteins, which are involved in iron uptake in mammalian cells, also occur in schistosomes. Iron uptake assays demonstrated that SmDMT1s were able to rescue yeast growth in ferrous iron-transport deficient yeast (fet3fet4). This is the first description of a DMT1 homologue in a hematophagous helminth parasite. One EST with homology to the 3′-end of SmDMT1 has also been deposited in the Schistosoma japonicum data base (32Hu W. Yan Q. Shen D.K. Liu F. Zhu Z.D. Song H.D. Xu X.R. Wang Z.J. Rong Y.P. Zeng L.C.

Genet. 2003; 35: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The Nramp family of proteins is highly conserved and is expressed in many species, and it is therefore not surprising that members also occur in platyhelminths. Schistosomes have a high demand for iron and are known to bind host transferrin at their surface (33Clemens L.E. Basch P.F. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Female parasites express a ferritin in vitelline cells presumably as a iron store for embryogenesis (13Schussler P. Potters E. Winnen R. Bottke W. Kunz W. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34WoldeMussie E. Bennett J.L. J. Parasitol. 1982; 68: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although much remains to be resolved about iron transport, storage, and utilization in schistosomes, the data of Clemens and Basch (33Clemens L.E. Basch P.F. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and those presented here suggest two surface-linked pathways for iron absorption, a transferrin-dependent and transferrin-independent pathway. Two S. mansoni DMT1 genes were identified in this study. The two sequences differed only in the N-terminal regions and had different expression profiles throughout the life cycle. SmDMT1A was expressed in all stages examined, whereas SmDMT1B expression appeared stronge"

Activated Abl phosphorylates tyrosine 221 of c-CrkII (Crk; Crk-Y221-P), which prevents Crk from binding to the docking protein p130CAS (CAS). Disruption of CAS-Crk binding blocks downstream effectors of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion assembly, inhibits cell migration, and disrupts survival signals leading to apoptosis. Here we show that inhibition of the 26 S proteasome and ubiquitination facilitates Abl-mediated Crk-Y221-P, leading to disassembly of CAS-Crk complexes in cells. Surprisingly, inhibition of these molecular interactions does not perturb cell migration but rather specifically induces apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that attachment to an extracellular matrix plays a key role in regulating the apoptotic machinery through caspase-mediated cleavage of Abl and Crk-Y221-P. Our findings indicate that regulated protein degradation by the proteasome specifically controls cell death through regulation of Abl-mediated Crk Tyr221 phosphorylation and assembly of the CAS-Crk signaling scaffold.

Our findings indicate that regulated protein degradation by the proteasome specifically controls cell death through regulation of Abl-mediated Crk Tyr221 phosphorylation and assembly of the CAS-Crk signaling scaffold. The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is the primary system for extralysosomal protein degradation. The 26 S proteasome is a large 2.4-MDa multicatalytic protease unit present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells (1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 2Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It consists of a 20 S core catalytic complex arranged as a cylinder capped at both ends by the 19 S regulatory subunits, which provide specificity to proteasome function. Ubiquitin is an abundant 76-amino acid polypeptide that is covalently attached to a target protein at lysine residues through a sequence of enzymatic reactions involving a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and ubiquitin ligase. Proteins targeted for degradation are polyubiquitinated by the addition of multiple ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues in the previous ubiquitin tag. The proteolytic fate of a given protein is a complex process that is tightly regulated by an intricate balance of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases that control tagging of proteins with ubiquitin and targeting to the 26 S proteasome. Regulated protein degradation through the ubiquitin system is necessary for maintaining normal cellular function. This regulation includes eliminating aberrant proteins as well maintaining the proper levels of transcriptional and cell cycle regulatory proteins, activated kinases, and signal transduction molecules. Indeed, numerous important cellular proteins involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis have been found to undergo ubiquitination and processing by the 26 S proteasome, including p53, Bcl-2, cyclins A, D, and E, and β-catenin. In recent years, protein ubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome has gained appreciation not only as a physiological regulator of normal cell function but also as a potential antineoplastic target of cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases (3Adams J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The proteasome inhibitors lactacystin, MG132, and bortezomib have been shown to have efficacy against various human tumor cells, and clinical trials are in progress with these agents or derivatives of these compounds (3Adams J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Although the anti-cancer effects are not fully elucidated, they typically involve growth arrest of cells and induction of apoptosis due to cellular stress. Cancerous cells are more susceptible than normal cells to these inhibitors because of the burden placed on the proteasome due to the increased metabolic rate of proliferating tumor cells (3Adams J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that deregulated proteolysis of several tumor suppressors and oncoproteins, such as p53 and BCR-Abl, is associated with neoplastic proliferation, tumor progression, and poor patient prognosis. Although the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway has been linked to key cellular functions, the mechanisms that regulate degradation of targeted proteins in normal and transformed cells are largely unknown. Numerous ubiquitinated proteins remain to be deciphered and assigned a cellular function, including cell-adhesive and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins that contribute to malignancy and cancer progression. We have previously shown that the molecular coupling of the adaptor protein c-CrkII (Crk) 4The abbreviations and trivial name used are: Crk, cCrkII; Abl, c-Abl (Abelson family tyrosine kinase); Abl-TM, Abl triple mutant; Abl-WT, Abl wild type; CAS, p130CAS (Crkassociated substrate); Crk-Y221-P, Crk phosphorylated at tyrosine 221; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase; TSA, trichostatin A; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; MG132, benzyloxycarbonyl-LLL. 4The abbreviations and trivial name used are: Crk, cCrkII; Abl, c-Abl (Abelson family tyrosine kinase); Abl-TM, Abl triple mutant; Abl-WT, Abl wild type; CAS, p130CAS (Crkassociated substrate); Crk-Y221-P, Crk phosphorylated at tyrosine 221; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase; TSA, trichostatin A; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; MG132, benzyloxycarbonyl-LLL. to the docking protein p130CAS (Crk-associated substrate (CAS)) serves as a switch that induces cell migration and suppresses apoptosis in invasive cells (4Chodniewicz D.

The formation of this molecular scaffold operates downstream of integrin and growth factor receptors in numerous cell types in vitro and in vivo (4Chodniewicz D. Klemke R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Chodniewicz D. Klemke R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 301: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, Abl and its related partner Arg (Abl-related gene product) have emerged as key negative regulators of CAS-Crk coupling in migratory and apoptotic cells (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When Abl phosphorylates Crk on tyrosine 221, it induces an intramolecular folding that binds the Crk Src homology 2 domain to the phosphorylated Tyr221 in its C-terminal region. This intramolecular binding prevents the binding of Crk to phosphotyrosine residues present in the substrate domain of CAS, leading to decreased cell movement and induction of cell death (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Chodniewicz D. Klemke R.L. Exp.

Here we investigate the role of ubiquitination and protein degradation in regulating the Abl/CAS/Crk pathway that controls cell migration and survival. Deregulation of the proteasome promotes Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Crk, disassembly of CAS-Crk complexes, and cell death. Reagents—Expression vectors for ubiquitin were provided by Dr. Ron Kopito (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Crk plasmids have been described previously (6Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). HA-tagged Abl was constructed as previously reported (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Abl wild type and Abl-TM were constructed as previously described (11Barila D. Rufini A. Condo I. Ventura N. Dorey K. Superti-Furga G. Testi R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2790-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Me2SO, l-α-lysophosphatdic acid), and trichostatin A (TSA) were purchased from Sigma. Lactacystin, benzyloxycarbonyl-LLL (MG132), cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, and caspase inhibitor I (benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethylketone) were provided by Cal-biochem. Human fibronectin, antibodies to CAS (for immunoblot), Crk, and paxillin were from BD Biosciences. PDGF-BB was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. STI-571 (Gleevac) was obtained from Novartis (La Jolla, CA). Antibodies to FAK, CAS (for immunoprecipitation), and c-Myc (9E10) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Phosphospecific antibodies to paxillin phosphorylated at Tyr31 and FAK phosphorylated at Tyr397 were obtained from BIOSOURCE. Antibodies to Crk-Y221-P and cleaved PARP (Asp214) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Ubiquitin antibody was from Chemicon. HA-tagged antibody was from Roche Applied Science, and Abl antibody was from Sigma. Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. Tony Hunter (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). COS-7 cells were from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell lines used were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-products), 200 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma), and 100 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma). Suspension assays were performed using ultralow attachment 10-cm dishes from Corning, or a thin layer of agar was applied to prevent cell attachment. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transfection experiments, 100-mm dishes of cells 60–80% confluent were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 20 μl of Lipofectamine was preincubated with 3.5 μg of the appropriate plasmid DNA in 1 ml of transfection medium for 30 min. The volume was brought to 6 ml and layered over cells for 6–8 h at 37 °C. Cells were used for the appropriate assays within 48 h subsequent to serum starvation overnight. Immunoprecipitations and Western blots were performed as previously described (10Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Abl Null Cells—c-Abl expression in Abl null cells (A. E. Kolesky, Yale University) was induced through retroviral mediated gene transfer using Bosc cell-generated retrovirus as previously described (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To generate cells expressing Abl-WT and Abl-TM, Abl null cells were infected with retroviral vectors using the LIN XE packaging cell line (Dr. Peiqing Sun, The Scripps Research Institute) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Adhesion and Migration Assays—Migration and adhesion assays were performed as described previously (10Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Briefly, Boyden chambers containing polycarbonate membranes (tissue culture-treated, 6.5-mm diameter, 10-μm thickness, 8-μm pores, Transwell®; Costar Corp. (Cambridge, MA) or Chemicon Inc.) were coated on the bottom (haptotaxis) with human fibronectin for 2 h at 37°C. Serum-starved cells were allowed to migrate 3–5 h and then stained with crystal violet (Sigma). In some cases, migratory cells transfected with Crk constructs were co-transfected along with the reporter vector pCMV SPORT β-galactosidase (Invitrogen). Developing was completed using X-gal (Promega) as a substrate according to the manufacturer's recommendation and as previously described (10Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). For cell adhesion assays, an aliquot of cells used in the migration experiments were allowed to attach for the indicated times to fibronectin (10 mg/ml)-coated cell culture wells at 37 °C and stained with crystal violet or X-gal reagent. Following migration, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet, or transfected cells were fixed in β-galactosidase fixative and stained using X-gal according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To assess cellular adhesion/migration, the cells were directly counted or the stain eluted with 10% acetic acid and measured in an ELISA plate reader (A560). Apoptosis Assays—Cell apoptosis was determined by evaluating nuclear morphology and cell fragmentation as previously described with minor modifications (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved overnight and then treated with the appropriate apoptotic agent or the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571, as indicated in the figure legend (Fig. 7), either on culture dishes coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin or culture dishes coated with a thin layer of agar to prevent cell adhesion (suspension conditions). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), permeabilized with 10% SDS, and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma) to visualize nuclear morphology. The number of cells with condensed chromatin or fragmented nuclei were scored per microscopic field using a Leica DMIRE 2 microscope and SimplePCI Software program version 5.2 from Compix Inc. Imaging Systems. Percentage of apoptosis was determined by counting the number of apoptotic nuclei per field of at least five fields. All of the graphs (Figs. 4, 5, and 7) show the mean results of three experiments. In some cases, an aliquot of cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot for the cleaved, activated form of PARP (85 kDa) or stained with anti-terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nick end labeling antibodies (Roche Applied Science) and examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as an indicator of apoptosis.FIGURE 4Blocking protein degradation by the 26 S proteasome does not affect CAS-Crk or PDGF-BB-induced cell migration or adhesion to the ECM. COS-7 or NIH 3T3 cells in culture were treated for 6 h with either 10 μg/ml MG132 (A) or 10 μm lactacystin (+) or Me2SO (DMSO)(–)(B) and then examined for their ability to migrate for 3 h in a haptotaxis assay (A and B) or attach to fibronectin-coated dishes for the indicated times in the continued presence of the compounds (C and D). E, NIH 3T3 cells were treated in culture with 10 μm lactacystin (+) or Me2SO (–) for 6 h then examined for chemotaxis toward 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB (+) or buffer only (–) for 3 h or allowed to attach to fibronectin-coated dishes for 60 min in the continued presence of the compound (F). Shown is haptotaxis cell migration (G) or adhesion of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged ubiquitin (+) or the empty vector (–)(H). Cells were allowed to migrate for 3 h or attach to fibronectin-coated dishes for 60 min. An aliquot of the cells was lysed and subjected to Western blot with anti-Myc antibodies to reveal Myc-tagged ubiquitinated proteins (myc-Ub) in transfected cells (G, inset). The number of transfected migratory or adherent cells was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each bar or point represents the mean ± S.E. of cells in triplicate migration/adhesion chambers of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome induces apoptosis through Abl-mediated disruption of Crk signaling. A, embryonic fibroblast cells with and without Abl kinases as described in the legend to Fig. 3A were treated with 10 μg/ml MG132 or Me2SO (DMSO) for either 8 or 24 h. The percentage of cells with apoptotic nuclei were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Crk or the empty vector (mock) and then 48 h later were treated with 10 μg/ml MG132 or 25 μm cisplatin for 24 h and examined for the percentage of apoptotic cells. The number of apoptotic cells is relative to Me2SO-treated control cells and is represented as the percentage of control cells. C, COS-7 cells transfected as in B were treated with 10 μm lactacystin, 25 μm cisplatin, or a similar amount of vehicle (Me2SO) for 6 h and then allowed to migrate in a haptotaxis assay toward fibronectin for 3 h in the continued presence of the compounds. The number of migratory cells was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each bar or point represents the mean ± S.E. of cells in triplicate migration chambers of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of Protein Degradation by the 26 S Proteasome Induces Crk-Y221-P and Disassembly of CAS-Crk Complexes—To determine whether Crk-Y221-P is regulated by ubiquitination and protein degradation, cells were treated for various times with MG132 or lactacystin, which block 26 S proteasome function through distinct mechanisms. Lactacystin is a natural, microbial product that acts as a pseudosubstrate that becomes covalently attached to hydroxyl groups on the active site threonine of β subunits (12Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). MG132 is a highly potent substrate analogue that inhibits the chymotryptic activity of the 26 S proteasome (13Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). As expected, both compounds inhibited proteasome function as indicated by the accumulation of high molecular weight, polyubiquitinated proteins in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Importantly, cells treated with these inhibitors show a strong increase in the level of HSP70 (14Kim D. Kim S.H. Li G.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This specialized protein can easily be visualized using Ponceau stain prior to Western blotting of whole cell lysates (data not shown). Also associated with the inhibition of the 26 S proteasome was a reduction in Crk mobility in SDS-PAGE, which is due to phosphorylation of Crk at tyrosine 221, as previously reported (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Kain K.H. Klemke R.L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In cultured cells treated with proteasome inhibitors, Crk phosphorylation was first evident 4–6 h after treatment and appeared to maximize between 8 and 12 h (Fig. 1, A and B). There were no notable changes in the steady state levels of Crk, and no high molecular weight forms indicative of polyubiquitination were evident. Furthermore, we did not detect changes in the phosphorylation or protein levels of FAK, paxillin, or CAS in cultured cells or cells removed from the dishes and allowed to reattach to fibronectin coated dishes for various times (Fig. 1, C and D). It is also possible to inhibit proteasome function through overexpression of free ubiquitin in cells (16Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36852-36858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Increased availability of unincorporated ubiquitin increases the level of total ubiquitinated proteins. The increased demand of ubiquitinated proteins to be processed leads to a reduction in proteasome function. Transient transfection of ubiquitin led to increased accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and increased Crk phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome did not globally alter protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cells (data not shown), nor did it alter other focal adhesion proteins, including tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of FAK and paxillin in response to cell adhesion to the ECM (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, the increase in Crk Tyr221 phosphorylation in response to inhibition of the 26 S proteasome was associated with a 50% decrease in CAS-Crk coupling (Fig. 2C). Thus, inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation specifically facilitates Crk-Y221-P and decreases CAS-Crk coupling. It is noteworthy that the total level of focal adhesion proteins was not significantly altered, suggesting that regulated protein degradation through the 26 S proteasome is not the major mechanism used to control steady-state levels of Crk, FAK, CAS, or paxillin (Figs. 1 and 2). However, our findings do not exclude the possibility that they are ubiquitinated/deubiquinated under specific conditions or in other cell types. Abl Tyrosine Kinase Is Necessary for Crk-Y221-P Induced by Inhibition of the 26 S Proteasome—Our previous findings show that Abl and Arg are the primary tyrosine kinases responsible for Crk-Y221-P in cells (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Kain K.H. Klemke R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16185-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Endogenous Abl serves as a negative feedback mechanism that controls cell migration through phosphorylation of Crk Tyr221, leading to inhibition of CAS-Crk coupling in cells. Abl is responsible for CrkY221-P in MG132- and lactacystin-treated cells, since mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells deficient in Abl and Arg (Abl null) did not show Crk-Y221-P in response to these compounds, whereas wild type MEFs or Abl-null cells reconstituted with Abl did (Fig. 3, A and B). Also, embryonic fibroblast cells isolated from mice deficient in Abl, but not Arg (abl–/–arg+/+), showed increased Crk-Y221-P in response to treatment with lactacystin (Fig. 3C). Thus, Abl and/or Arg can facilitate Crk-Y221-P in MEF cells treated with lactacystin. Furthermore, treatment of COS-7 (data not shown), MEF, and MDA-435 cells with the Abl and Arg kinase inhibitor STI-571 prevented Crk-Y221-P induced by MG132, indicating that Abl/Arg kinase activity is necessary for this process (Fig. 7, A and B). Again, inhibition of the proteasome did not alter paxillin phosphorylation (Fig. 3A) or global phosphorylation of proteins as indicated by Western blotting of whole cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that Abl/Arg are necessary for Crk-Y221-P in response to inhibition of the proteasome. Inhibition of the 26 S Proteasome Does Not Affect CAS-Crk-mediated Cell Migration—We next wanted to determine whether the uncoupling of Crk from CAS in response to proteasome inhibition altered cell attachment and migration on the ECM. Surprisingly, it did not alter cell adhesion or basal haptotaxis migration of NIH 3T3 or COS-7 cells, nor did it affect haptotaxis migration induced by overexpression of Crk. We have previously shown this overexpression induces strong migration in numerous cell types (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Kain K.H. Klemke R.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A–C). Overexpression of Crk also did not affect chemotaxis migration induced by PDGF-BB (Fig. 4, E and F). Similar findings were obtained with cells in which the 26 S proteasome function was inhibited by overexpression of free ubiquitin (Fig. 4, G and H). Together, these findings indicate that perturbation of protein degradation by the proteasome does not impact cell adhesion or migration on the ECM, nor does it impact the activity of FAK and paxillin, which regulate these processes (Figs. 1 and 2). Inhibition of the 26 S Proteasome Induces Cell Apoptosis through Abl-mediated Disruption of Crk Signaling—Although regulated protein degradation by the proteasome does not appear to be necessary for cell attachment or migration mediated through an Abl/CAS/Crk pathway, it may play a distinct role in the regulation of survival mechanisms controlled by this pathway (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Abl and CrkY221-P are involved in apoptosis induced by inhibition of the proteasome, we examined cell death in wild type, Abl null cells, and Abl null cells reconstituted with Abl after treatment with MG132 or lactacystin for either 8 or 24 h. We did not observe any significant differences in apoptosis in cells treated for 8 h with the proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 5A). However, after 24 h, Abl null cells showed significantly less apoptosis in response to MG132 and lactacystin compared with Abl null cells reconstituted with Abl and wild type MEFs (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, cells overexpressing Crk showed decreased apoptosis in response to inhibition of the proteasome, indicating that Crk plays an important role in the death response (Fig. 5B). Our previous work demonstrates that overexpression of Crk promotes increased CAS-Crk assembly, resulting in increased cell migration and survival as well as increased cancer cell metastasis in animal models (5Kain K.H. Gooch S. Klemke R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells overexpressing Crk and treated with the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin, which activates Abl (19Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.

As expected, treatment of cells with either cisplatin or proteasome inhibitors for 8 h did not alter cell migration, since these pathways are distinct from apoptotic regulation pathways (Fig. 5C). These findings indicate that Abl and Crk contribute to apoptosis induced by inhibition of the proteasome. Cell Adhesion to the ECM Regulates Abl-mediated Crk-Y221-P and Apoptosis in Response to Inhibition of the 26 S Proteasome—The context of the ECM and formation of integrin contacts can determine whether a cell responds to a given apoptotic signal such as DNA damage (22Truong T.

For example, in some cell types, detachment from the ECM promotes caspase-mediated apoptosis or anoikis death (23Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A.

The identity of LRBP was later established as mevalonate kinase (MVK). The present study examined if LRBP binding to LHR mRNA impairs translation. A full-length FLAG-tagged rat LHR mRNA was synthesized and translated in vitro. The translation product was immunoprecipitated and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The addition of LRBP inhibited LHR mRNA translation. This inhibitory effect was reversed by an excess of wild type (wt) LBS. To determine whether this reversal of the inhibitory effect of LRBP was indeed due to the sequestration of LRBP by the wtLBS, a translation reaction was performed in the presence of mutated LBS in which all the cytidine in the wtLBS was mutated to uridine. This mutation of LBS has been shown to render it incapable of interacting with LRBP. Unlike wtLBS, the mutated LBS was unable to reverse the inhibitory effect of LRBP on LHR mRNA translation. The addition of mevalonate, which has been shown to compete for LHR mRNA binding to LRBP, also reduced the extent of translation inhibition by LRBP. Endogenous association of LHR mRNA with MVK was assessed by immunoprecipitation of the ribonucleoprotein complex with MVK antibody followed by reverse transcription-PCR of the RNA associated with the immune complex. Amplification of LHR mRNA, if any, associated with the immunoprecipitate obtained from ovarian ribonucleoprotein complex with gene-specific primers confirmed the association of LHR mRNA with MVK.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) belongs to the rhodopsin/β2-adrenergic receptor subfamily A of G-protein-coupled receptors (2McFarland K. Sprengel R. Phillips H. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K.

Rev. 2002; 23: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In the ovary interaction of LH with LHR leads to increased production of cAMP, which in turn stimulates steroidogenesis and other specialized functions of the ovary such as ovulation (1Dufau M.L.

Steril. 1974; 25: 732-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The expression of LHR on the cell surface varies during different stages of the ovarian cycle, thereby regulating the actions of LH. In rat ovarian granulosa and luteal cells, the expression of LHR is greatly decreased by the endogenous preovulatory LH surge or by the administration of a pharmacological dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a placental counterpart of LH (5Lapolt P.

Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the decline in cell surface expression of ovarian LHR seen after hCG administration is paralleled by a specific, transient loss of all four LHR mRNA transcripts (10Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have shown that this transient loss of LHR mRNA does not result from decreased transcription but occurs post-transcriptionally with a 3-fold decrease in mRNA half-life (8Lu D. Peegel H. Mosier S. Menon K.M.J Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Further studies have shown that a specific LH receptor mRNA-binding protein (LRBP), identified in the ovarian cytosolic fraction, plays a regulatory role in the expression of LHR mRNA by binding to a polypyrimidine-rich, bi-partite sequence in the coding region of LHR mRNA (10Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). LRBP exhibits characteristics of a functional mRNA-binding protein with respect to expression in target cells, induction of its expression in the ovary when LHR mRNA levels are down-regulated, and also by demonstration of its ability to increase the degradation of LHR mRNA in an in vitro decay system (10Kash J.C.

Subsequent studies led to the purification and identification of this trans-acting factor as mevalonate kinase (MVK) (12Nair A.K. Menon K.M.J J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14937-14944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In vivo studies showed an increase in mevalonate kinase expression in rat corpus luteum before ligand-induced loss of LHR mRNA, consistent with its role as an endogenous regulator of LHR mRNA expression (14Wang L. Menon K.M.J Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the mRNA binding characteristics of this protein revealed specificity for sequences in the LHR mRNA coding region, the present studies were undertaken to examine if binding of LRBP to the coding region of LHR mRNA impairs translation. The results presented here show that in a cell-free in vitro translation system, LRBP binds to the coding region of LHR mRNA, and the resulting ribonucleoprotein complex prevents LHR mRNA translation. This was further supported by the fact that immunoprecipitation of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex from ovarian homogenate showed the association of LH receptor mRNA with mevalonate kinase in vivo during hCG-induced LH receptor down-regulation in the ovary.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin was purchased from Calbiochem. Highly purified human chorionic gonadotropin (CR 127) was a gift from the Center for Population Research (NICHD, National Institutes of Health) through the National Hormone and pituitary Program. [α-32P]UTP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Redivue l-[35S]methionine (in vitro translation grade) was from Amersham Biosciences. mMessage mMachine T7 Ultra was a product of Ambion (Austin, TX). EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets and Quick spin columns (G-50-Sephadex) for radiolabeled RNA purification were obtained from Roche Applied Science. RNasin and Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate system were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Macro-Prep high S support column was from Bio-Rad. Centriplus YM-10, Centricon YM-10, and Microcon YM-10 were products of Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel and dl-mevalonic acid lactone were purchased from Sigma. BCA reagent was from Pierce. Enlightning (rapid autoradiography enhancer) reagent was a product of PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Animals and Tissues—Pseudopregnancy was induced in 21-day-old Sprague-Dawley female rats by subcutaneous injection of 50 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin followed by 25 IU of hCG 56 h later. The day of hCG injection was taken as day 0. LH receptor down-regulation was induced by the injection of 50 IU of hCG on the fifth day of pseudopregnancy. Ovaries were collected 6 and 12 h after hCG injection and were processed immediately for immunoprecipitation of RNP complex and LRBP purification.Purification of LRBP—LRBP from rat ovary was purified as described previously (12Nair A.K. Menon K.M.J J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14937-14944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Partial purification of LRBP was performed by homogenizing rat ovaries in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm KCl and protease inhibitor mixture at 4 °C. The cytoplasmic proteins were collected by centrifuging the homogenate at 105,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic proteins (S100 fraction) was collected and applied to a strong cation exchange column (Macro-Prep High S Support) equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with buffer A containing 50 mm KCl until the absorbance at 280 nm was less than 0.02. The partially purified LRBP was then eluted with buffer A containing 150 mm KCl and desalted to 50 mm KCl using Centricon YM-10 microconcentrators. The protein concentration was determined by BCA. The final purification was performed by separating the partially purified LRBP on SDS-PAGE and eluting the LRBP from the gel and renaturing as described before (12Nair A.K. Menon K.M.J J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14937-14944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, partially purified LRBP preparation was treated with SDS sample buffer at 37 °C for 10 min and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under a constant voltage of 150 V. The gel strip containing the LRBP was cut with a razor blade and placed in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The gel piece was then homogenized in elution-renaturation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) with a Teflon pestle and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5–10 min at 4 °C to sediment the residual polyacrylamide. The supernatant containing the LRBP was collected, buffer-exchanged with buffer A containing 50 mm KCl to remove TritonX-100, and concentrated using Microcon centrifugal filter device.Templates for in Vitro Transcription—The pCMV4 vector containing 2.1-kilobase rat LHR cDNA (15Bradbury F. Kawate N. Foster C. Menon K.M.J J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5921-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was used to generate the full-length rat LHR cDNA containing T7 promoter at the 5′ end and FLAG tag at the 3′ end. The oligonucleotide primers used for PCR were synthesized by Invitrogen, and their sequences were as follows: sense primer, 5′-GCATGCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATGGGGCGGCGAGTCCCAG-3′ (underlined sequences represent the T7 RNA polymerase promoter); antisense primer, 5′-CTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTGAGTTAACGCTCTCGGTGG-3′ (underlined sequences represent the FLAG tag). The cDNAs for generating the wild type and the mutant LRBP binding site (LBS) of LHR mRNA were chemically synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′ ends. The pBluescript SK vector containing the human β-actin (GenBank™ accession number M77874) was purchased from ATCC and digested with BssHII to obtain the β-actin cDNA with T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′ end and T3 RNA polymerase promoter at the 3′ end.In Vitro Transcription—Unlabeled and α-32P-labeled RNAs were in vitro transcribed from cDNA templates using Ambion in vitro transcription kits. The full-length capped and FLAG-tagged rat LHR mRNA and human β-actin mRNA were synthesized using mMessage mMachine T7 Ultra kit. The wild type and mutant LBSs were synthesized using the MAXIscript kit. The radiolabeled LHR mRNA was prepared using 60 μCi of [α-32P]UTP in the reaction mixture. After transcription, the RNAs were treated with RNase-free DNase 1 and extracted with nuclease-free water-saturated phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50: 49:1). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Quick spin columns (G-50 Sephadex). The RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol at –20 °C. The precipitated RNA was washed 3 times with 75% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in nuclease-free water. Both radiolabeled and unlabeled RNAs were quantitated spectrophotometrically at 260 nm.In Vitro Translation—In vitro translation reactions (25-μl reaction volume) were performed using a Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate system as described by the manufacturer. Proteins synthesized in vitro were labeled with [35S]methionine and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (BioRad mini gel) according to the method of Laemmli. The gel was fixed in 40% methanol (v/v) and 10% acetic acid (v/v) for 20 min and then incubated in Enlightning reagent for another 30 min. The gel was then dried under vacuum for 20 min at 80 °C and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation—FLAG-tagged in vitro translated rat LH receptor was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel. 25 μl of the in vitro translation reaction mixture was diluted to 500 μl with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). Anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel was washed 3 times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and added to the diluted translation reaction mixture (40 μl of gel suspension per 500 μl of diluted translation reaction mixture) and incubated overnight in an end-over-end shaker at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged for 5 s at 10,600 × g at room temperature, and supernatant was removed. The beads were washed 3 times with wash buffer, and 30 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. The beads with sample buffer were heated at 65 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at 10,600 × g for 5–10 s, and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was then applied onto a 10% SDS-PAGE.mRNA Decay Coupled to in Vitro Translation—In vitro translation of LHR mRNA was performed with 200 ng of α-32P-labeled LHR mRNA (100,000 cpm/reaction) using rabbit reticulocyte lysate system as described above in the presence or absence of LRBP. The in vitro translation reaction was stopped at 0, 20, and 40 min by adding 475 μl of high salt cleaning buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% SDS, and 400 mm NaCl) (16Fritz D.T. Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: RE1-R13Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) to 25 μl of reaction mixture. Yeast tRNA (10 μg) was added per reaction to allow quantitative recovery of LHR mRNA during precipitation. The remaining RNA in the reaction mixture was extracted with an equal volume of nuclease-free water-saturated phenol and chloroform (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62982) Google Scholar). The RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of isopropanol as described before (12Nair A.K. Menon K.M.J J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14937-14944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The precipitated RNA was washed 3 times with 75% ethanol and dried to remove any residual ethanol. The RNA was then resuspended in 10 μl of RNA loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 8 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol) and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea mini gel (Bio-Rad) (16Fritz D.T. Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: RE1-R13Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The gel was then dried and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation of RNP Complex—Immunoprecipitation of RNP complex was performed as described by Chu et al. (18Chu E. Schmitz J.C. Ju J. Copur S.M. Haynes S.R. RNA-Protein Interaction Protocols. 118. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 265-274Google Scholar). This technique is based on the immunoprecipitation procedure developed by Lerner and Steitz (19Lerner M.R. Steitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5495-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Rat ovaries were homogenized in NET-2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) containing RNasin (100 units/0.5 ml of buffer) and protease inhibitor. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C Supernatant was collected, and 1–1.5 mg of protein/ml of the extract was precleared with 300 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C in an end-over-end shaker and centrifuged at the end of the incubation period to remove the protein A-agarose beads. The cleared supernatant was then incubated with antibody for mevalonate kinase (12Nair A.K. Menon K.M.J J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14937-14944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) along with 50 μg of yeast tRNA and RNasin (100 units/0.5 ml) for 1 h at 4°C. Pre-immune rabbit IgG and high density lipoprotein-binding protein (HBP) antibody were used as negative controls. Protein A-agarose beads were then added at the end of the 1-h period and incubated further for another 30 min. The protein A-agarose immune complex was collected by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C The beads were washed 5 times with 400 μl of NET-2 buffer. After the final wash 400 μl of NET-2 buffer was added, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to phenolchloroform extraction to isolate the nucleic acids associated with the immune complex. The extract was then incubated with 10 units of RNase-free DNase 1 at 37 °C for 15 min followed by phenol-chloroform extraction again to isolate the RNA remaining in the extract. The RNA was then precipitated in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen by isopropanol at –20 °C The RNA was washed 2 times with 80% ethanol and dissolved in 15 μl of nuclease-free water.RT-PCR of Precipitated RNA—Full-length rat LH receptor DNA was synthesized by RT-PCR using Invitrogen SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (40 cycles of PCR). Five μl of the immunoprecipitated RNA was used for the amplification with the oligonucleotide primers synthesized by Invitrogen. Their sequences were as follows: sense primer, 5′-GCATGCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATGGGGCGGCGAGTCCCAG-3′ (underlined sequences represent the T7 RNA polymerase promoter); antisense primer, 5′-CTAGTGAGTTAACGCTCTCGGTGG-3′.Analysis of the Amplified DNA Sequence—RT-PCR products were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and the DNA bands were isolated by QIAquick gel extraction kit. The purified DNA was subjected to PCR (40 cycles) using Invitrogen PCR Platinum SuperMix for amplifying the first nearly 300 nt of rat LH receptor cDNA. The sequences of primers used were as follows: sense primer, 5′-GCATGCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATGGGGCGGCGAGTCCCAG-3′ (underlined sequences represent the T7 RNA polymerase promoter); antisense primer, 5′-CCTTTCCAGGGAATCACTC-3′. The amplified DNA products were isolated after separation on a 0.8% agarose gel, and the purified products were subjected to PstI nuclease digestion. The digested DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.RESULTSIn Vitro Translation of FLAG-tagged Rat LHR mRNA—A FLAG sequence was introduced at the 3′ end of rat LH receptor cDNA, and the corresponding mRNA was transcribed for the in vitro translation and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the translated protein as described under “Materials and Methods.” To examine if the FLAG-tagged rat LH receptor mRNA could be translated in vitro, varying concentrations of FLAG-tagged LH receptor mRNA were used in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system using 15 μCi of [35S]methionine in a 25-μl reaction volume. The reaction was performed for 90 min at 30 °C The translation product was then immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to autoradiography. The autoradiogram (Fig. 1a) revealed a single prominent band at about 63 kDa, and the intensity of this band increased with increasing mRNA concentrations from 50 to 200 ng in the translation reaction. A negative control reaction, performed with no RNA added to the translation reaction, yielded no protein band. The expected size of the non-glycosylated rat LH receptor is about 62 kDa (20Keinanen K.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the FLAG epitope introduced contained 8 amino acids, the size of the non-glycosylated LH receptor was expected to be about 63 kDa. To further confirm that the band seen on the autoradiogram was indeed LHR protein and not a nonspecific translation product, in vitro translation was performed with LHR mRNA with and without FLAG tag at the 3′ end. LHR protein was then immunoprecipitated from the reaction mixtures, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then subjected to autoradiography. The results presented in Fig. 2b show that the LHR protein band was visible only in the translated products of FLAG-tagged LHR mRNA (lane 3). No LHR protein-specific band (lane 1 and 2) was seen when translation products were immunoprecipitated from reaction mixtures either containing no RNA or non-FLAG-tagged LHR mRNA.FIGURE 2Translation of LHR mRNA in vitro; effect of LRBP. 200 ng of FLAG-tagged rat LHR mRNA was in vitro translated using 15 μCi of [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of partially purified rat LRBP from the ovary or fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) at different concentrations (2.5 and 5.0 μg). The translated LHR protein was immunoprecipitated, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and developed for autoradiogram. b, 200 ng of FLAG-tagged rat LHR mRNA was in vitro translated using 15 μCi of [35S]methionine in the absence and presence of purified rat LRBP at different concentrations (1, 2, and 3 μg). The translated LHR protein was immunoprecipitated and processed for developing autoradiogram. c, 1 μg of capped FLAG-tagged rat LHR mRNA was in vitro translated in a 125-μl reaction system containing 5 μg of purified LRBP. 25-μl aliquots were withdrawn at 20, 30, 40, and 60 min of reaction and were processed for immunoprecipitation of LHR protein and autoradiogram. A control reaction was performed in the absence of purified LRBP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of LRBP on the Translation of LHR mRNA in Vitro—We have previously shown that LRBP specifically binds to the coding region of LH receptor mRNA (10Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To examine if binding of LRBP to LH receptor mRNA in the coding region has any effect on the translation of the mRNA, in vitro translation of LH receptor mRNA was performed in the absence and presence of LRBP at different concentrations for 90 min, and the resulting translated LHR protein was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then subjected to autoradiography. The results (Fig. 2a) show that the LRBP caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the translation of LHR mRNA. Inclusion of an irrelevant protein, bovine serum albumin, did not have any effect on the synthesis of LH receptor protein. The translation reaction of LHR mRNA was also conducted in the presence of varying concentrations of gel-purified rat LRBP. The resulting LHR protein was analyzed as described above, and the results are shown in the Fig. 2b. The results clearly showed an inhibition of translation of LHR mRNA by as low as one μg of gel-purified rat LRBP and produced almost complete inhibition at the 2-μg level. A time-course of in vitro translation of LHR mRNA was then performed in the absence or presence of 1 μg of gel-purified rat LRBP. The results (Fig. 2c) showed translation inhibition by LRBP at all time intervals starting at 20 min of translation reaction when compared with the respective control reactions. It should be noted that there was a slight increase in the translation of LH receptor mRNA with increase in incubation time, which is due to continued translation of LH receptor mRNA with the progress in incubation time.To examine if this inhibition of LHR mRNA translation by LRBP was specific to LHR mRNA, human β-actin mRNA was in vitro translated in the presence of rat LRBP, and the resulting translation products were examined by SDS-PAGE, as described above. As shown in Fig. 3, there was no change in β-actin protein synthesis in the presence of LRBP, thus indicating that the inhibitory effect of LRBP was specific to the translation of LHR mRNA.FIGURE 3In vitro translation of β-actin mRNA; effect of LRBP. β-Actin mRNA (200 ng) was translated in vitro by Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate system using 15 μCi of [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of 5.0μg of partially purified rat LRBP from the ovary. A5-μl aliquot from a 25-μl reaction system was analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was fixed, incubated in Enlightning reagent, dried, and exposed to x-ray film.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of LRBP on the Translation of Rat LHR mRNA in the Presence of wtLBS and mLBS—We have previously shown that LRBP binds to a bipartite, polypyrimidine-rich sequence in the coding region of rat LHR mRNA, and all the cytidine residues in this region are required for the binding of LRBP (11Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This 40-nt (188–228) region of the rat LHR mRNA was designated as the LBS.To further examine if the translation inhibition caused by LRBP was indeed due to the binding of LRBP to the LHR mRNA, in vitro translation reactions were performed in the presence of wild type LRBP binding site (wtLBS) or mutated (all the cytidines mutated to uridines) LRBP binding site (mLBS) of rat LHR mRNA (11Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in molar excess to the full-length rat LHR mRNA. The resulting translation products were then immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described above. The results (Fig. 4) clearly indicate that the LRBP caused an inhibition of LHR mRNA translation (lanes 3 and 4) when compared with translation reactions performed in the absence of LRBP (lanes 1 and 2). The inhibition in translation produced by LRBP was decreased by the inclusion of wtLBS in the reaction in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 5, 6 and 7). The addition of mLBS, which does not bind to LRBP (11Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), did not cause any change in the inhibition of translation of LHR mRNA produced by LRBP (lanes 8–10). These data indicate that the translation inhibition caused by LRBP was due to the binding of LRBP to the LHR mRNA.FIGURE 4In vitro translation of LH receptor mRNA; effect of wtLBS and"
https://openalex.org/W2083860715,"Apoptosis is a key mechanism in spermatogenesis, and in testis, most gonocytes degenerate at fetal and postnatal ages to select a cell subset committed to become germ stem cells. The aim of the present study is to investigate mechanisms controlling the massive apoptosis of fetal gonocytes. We evaluated the expression and function of c-Flip, an apoptosis inhibitor known to interfere with the proapoptotic Fas-signaling pathway in a variety of cell types, but never investigated in fetal testis. Expression of c-Flip long isoform (c-FlipL) within fetal testis was localized in gonocytes at 16.5 and 18.5 days post coitum (dpc), both at the mRNA and protein level, while it was weakly expressed or undetectable at earlier stages. Moreover, Fas protein was found in fetal testes at 13.5, 16.5, and 18.5 dpc. Testes at 18.5 dpc, expressing high levels of c-FlipL, were resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis while they became highly sensitive when c-FlipL was inhibited by antisense c-Flip oligos. In addition, there was an inverse relation between gonocyte spontaneous apoptosis sensitivity and c-FlipL levels. Furthermore, caspase-10 activity was inversely related with c-FlipL expression, suggesting that caspase-10 might be a target of c-FlipL. These data represent the first evidence demonstrating c-Flip expression in fetal testes and its role in protecting gonocytes from Fas-dependent apoptosis."
