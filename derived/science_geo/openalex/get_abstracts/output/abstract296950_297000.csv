https://openalex.org/W2018635133,"High-precision measurements of total solar irradiance, made by the active cavity radiometer irradiance monitor on the Solar Maximum Mission satellite, show the irradiance to have been variable throughout the first 153 days of observations. The corrected data resolve orbit-to-orbit variations with uncertainties as small as 0.001 percent. Irradiance fluctuations are typical of a band-limited noise spectrum with high-frequency cutoff near 0.15 day–1; their amplitudes about the mean value of 1368.31 watts per square meter approach ± 0.05 percent. Two large decreases in irradiance of up to 0.2 percent lasting about 1 week are highly correlated with the development of sunspot groups. The magnitude and time scale of the irradiance variability suggest that considerable energy storage occurs within the convection zone in solar active regions."
https://openalex.org/W1974824726,"Laboratory experiments performed on a monogamous estrildid, the zebra finch (Poephila guttata), indicate that sex ratio of offspring is affected by non-genetic markers (colored plastic leg bands) that vary in attractiveness to birds. Results suggest that natural selection favors individuals that produce offspring of the sex of the more attractive parent within a breeding pair."
https://openalex.org/W1979287332,"The apparent microbial conversion of acetate to methane ranges seasonally from 0.7 to 88 micromoles per liter of whole wet sediment per hour in the top 5 centimeters of methane-producing sediments underlying sulfate-reducing sediments in Cape Lookout Bight, North Carolina. The associated methane flux across the sediment-water interface into overlying waters exhibits the same seasonal pattern. Significant methane production from acetate is observed only in sulfate-depleted sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2065540600,"The gas vacuoles seen in several species of blue-green algae under the light microscope are shown by electron microscopy to correspond to packed arrays of cylindrical, electron-transparent vesicles. Single vesicles average 75 millimicrons in diameter, range from 0.2 micron to 1.0 micron in length, have conical ends, and are bounded by a single membrane 2 millimicrons wide. The reversible disappearance of gas vacuoles induced by sudden application of pressure is accompanied by a reversible collapse of the individual gas vesicles."

Short-term exposure or continuous exposure to low concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons caused no increase in mortality or changes in development rate, and increased megalopal weight was characteristic of such groups. This phenomenon, termed ""hormesis,"" is probably a generalized aspect of environmental stress etiology but has seldom been reported as such."
https://openalex.org/W2009270552,"The sensitivities of several woody and herbaceous species to single acute exposures to cobalt-60 gamma rays have been determined. Within each group the sensitivity of each species is largely determined by its average interphase chromosome volume (interphase nuclear volume divided by chromosome number) of shoot apical meristem cells. On the basis of the calculated amounts of energy absorbed (in kiloelectron volts) per interphase chromosome at an exposure necessary to produce a given biological effect, woody species were approximately twice as sensitive as herbaceous species."
https://openalex.org/W2073396520,"Single, isolated cells of tobacco divided and grew to form small colonies of over 50 cells in microcultures with a medium containing fresh liquid coconut milk, but in the absence of neighboring cells or nurse tissue. Subsequently, the mass of cells obtained from the single cell, when transferred to agar coconut milk medium, established itself as a clone of callus tissue. Some of these single-cell clones showed differentiation of many tracheid-like cells and shoots with small leaves."
https://openalex.org/W1973443621,"Studies with the light and electron microscope reveal that at least five different types of spermatozoa are produced during spermatogenesis in the arrhenotokous hymenopteran. Dahlbominus fusciupennis (Zett. Eulophidae). Two of the types differ from the others in length, one type lacks a continuous spiral helix in the head piece, and two differ from the others in the direction of the helical coil. Few of the first three types reach the female sperm-storage organ. All the spermatozoa of the last two types that do reach the storage organ have heads with either dextral or sinistral helices extending from the apex of the head to the beginning of the tail piece. The mitochondrial filaments of the tail are also spirally coiled around the central axial filament, but only in a dextral direction. It is suggested that the coiling dimorphism may be related to fertilization of the egg and may thus affect the sex ratio."

Several cases are documented in which sulfate particulates, formed from emissions in the Midwest and Northeast, traveled to the Gulf of Mexico and, in some cases, returned to their source regions."

Thus, the three types of endogenous hormones thought to originate in the seeds and to stimulate directly fruit growth can be supplied by plant parts other than seeds."
https://openalex.org/W2028897652,"A metallic phase of gallium antimonide, obtained by quenching at approximately 120 kilobars to 77°K and then releasing pressure, is a superconductor. The transition temperature depends on the annealing conditions; for samples annealed at 250°C under pressure before quenching, it is 4.24° ± 0.10°K, and Hc2 (the critical field) equals 2640 gauss at 3.50°K. This temperature is higher than the 2.1°K reported for metallic indium antimonide."
https://openalex.org/W2064731209,"The viscosities of liquid sodium and potassium were estimated up to the critical temperatures according to the method recently described for mercury. The critical absolute viscosity of sodium is 0.072 centipoise and that of potassium 0.055 centipoise, the estimated precision being plus or minus 0.01 centipoise. The critical absolute viscosities of metals are higher than those of covalent or homopolar substances of van der Waals type."

https://openalex.org/W1975402784,"During the three decades that have passed, medical science has ascended to a high plateau of achievement. The climb has involved several pathways; among them: (1) the physiological approach toward disease as experiments which nature performs on organisms, (2) the more intelligent interpretation of the functional reactions of the body in disease in accordance with latest discoveries in physiology, (3) the supplementation of observable phenomena through use of laboratory instruments, (4) the assumption of active investigation both on patients and experimental animals by clinicians themselves, (5) the shuttling of problems between clinical and experimental laboratories and (6) correlated research in clinical and physiological departments."

https://openalex.org/W4253253652,"In the report ""Mutagenicity of fly ash particles in Paramecium"" by J. Smith-Sonneborn et al. (9 Jan., p. 180), Tables 1 and 2 are printed incorrectly. Significance lines are missing from both tables and ""uninduced"" should read ""induced"" in the sixth, eighth, and ninth entries of the first column in Table 1. The tables are reprinted below as they should have appeared. Table 1. Mutagenic effect of fly ash and heat-treated fly ash in Paramecium. Values not connected by the same line are significantly different from each other (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, alpha = .05). The data from six experiments were pooled since the control values for autogamous progeny were not significantly different. Cerophyl is the ryegrass extract used for cultivation of Paramecium. Induced S-9 is the Ames liver microsome fraction from rats receiving Arochlor 1254 (polychlorinated biphenyl) to activate the enzymes for conversion of promutagens to mutagenic form; uninduced S-9 is from rats receiving corn oil only (the vehicle for the Arochlor). Glass beads (1 to 3 ,microm) suspended in either induced or uninduced S-9 were used as a negative control for nonnutritive particles. Kaolinite was also used in one experiment, and the results were the same as those for the glass beads. Benzo[a]pyrene was the positive control for mutagenicity requiring induced S-9. The initial concentration of suspended fly ash was 535 ,microg/ml. The average number of affected progeny from treated parent cells was 20 percent higher than the average number of affected control progeny. Since one mutation would theoretically yield only 4 affected progeny in 16 autogamous progeny from a treated parent cell (6), the percentages, though low, reflect significant damage. [See table in the PDF file] Table 2. Mutagenicity of heat-treated fly ash extracted with HCl or DMSO. Values not connected by the same line are significantly different from each other (pairwise comparisons of proportions, P < .05). The concentration of fly ash particles suspended in uninduced S-9 was 1068 ,ug/ml. The higher than usual value for mutagenicity in the controls can be attributed to the considerable age of the clone used here [micronuclear damage increases with age (12)].
