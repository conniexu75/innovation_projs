https://openalex.org/W2013545053,"The mouse heavy chain immunoglobulin gene contains a tissue-specific enhancer. The enhancer and flanking sequences were studied in vivo by carrying out dimethyl sulfate protection experiments on living cells, in combination with genomic sequencing. Relative to reactions on naked DNA, there are changes (protections and enhancements) in the reactivity of guanine residues to dimethyl sulfate within the enhancer sequence in myeloma, B, and early B cells, whereas virtually no alterations appear in cells of non-B lineage. Most of the affected residues are in four clusters, in sequences homologous to the octamer 5′CAGGTGGC 3′ (C, cytosine; A, adenine; G. guanine; T, thymine). The alterations in the pattern of G reactivity are consistent with the tissue-specific binding of molecules to the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer."

https://openalex.org/W2002554363,"cDNA clones originating from the engrailed gene of Drosophila have been isolated from recombinant phage libraries that were made using poly(A)+ RNA extracted from early embryos. The DNA sequence of one of these clones includes a homeo box, a 180 bp sequence present in several other Drosophila genes important in formation of body pattern during development. The homeo boxes found in the other Drosophila genes, as well as in cognate sequences from a wide range of segmented animals, including higher vertebrates, are highly conserved. By contrast, the homeo box within the engrailed gene diverges substantially and, unlike the other homeo boxes, is interrupted by an intervening sequence. The engrailed homeo box is located near the 3' end of a 1700 bp open reading frame. If translated, this sequence would produce a protein of unusual composition. We also show that a neighboring gene has a large region with strong homology to engrailed, and that it also contains a homeo box."
https://openalex.org/W1508175871,"The intracellularly trappable fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin-2 was used to measure free cytosolic Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, in the two highly dedifferentiated tumor cell lines, Ehrlich and Yoshida ascites carcinomas. It was found that these carcinoma cells can trap quin-2 similarly to normal cells, but [Ca2+]i was apparently significantly lower than in any normal cell tested previously with this method. By using a new lipid-soluble heavy metal chelator TPEN (N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine), which crosses artificial and natural membranes, it was found that endogenous heavy metals are responsible for partially quenching quin-2 fluorescence trapped inside the cells. Although the quenching of intracellular quin-2 fluorescence is quantitatively more relevant in these ascites carcinomas, TPEN was effective also in normal cells like lymphocytes and granulocytes. Both in the normal and especially in the malignant cell lines [Ca2+]i can be grossly underestimated at low intracellular quin-2 concentrations. Endogenous heavy metal quenching is thus a potential source of artifact when [Ca2+]i is measured with quin-2. When corrected for quin-2 fluorescence quenching by intracellular heavy metals, [Ca2+]i and basic regulatory mechanisms of [Ca2+]i homeostasis in Ehrlich and Yoshida carcinomas are similar to those of nontransformed cells."

https://openalex.org/W2063475293,"The engrailed locus plays a unique and critical role in organizing the segmented body plan of Drosophila. Embryos lacking engrailed function die with fused, abnormal segments. Adult mosaics with patches of engrailed cells similarly suffer defects in all of their segments, but only with mutant cells that are in the posterior developmental compartment of each segment. The non-uniform requirement for engrailed function reflects the position-dependent expression of the engrailed locus and we demonstrate it here unambiguously by directly visualizing engrailed transcripts in frozen sections of embryos and larvae and in whole imaginal discs. These results demonstrate that developmental compartments subdivide the embryonic insect segments. In these and in the compartments of the later developmental stages the engrailed locus is expressed in the posterior but not the anterior compartments. With its role in controlling the developmental pathway of the posterior compartment cells, the engrailed locus may be an example of a binary developmental switch."

https://openalex.org/W1969669223,"We present the initial characterization of a novel family of genes that rearrange in T cells, but do not encode either of the defined (α/β) subunits of the clonespecific heterodimer of the T cell receptor. The family comprises at least three variable (V) gene segments, three constant (C) gene segments, and three junction (J) gene segments. In a cloned cytolytic T lymphocyte, 2C, one of each of these fragments has productively rearranged to yield an expressed VJC transcription unit, which shows no evidence for somatic mutation. Short sequences similar to those implicated in immunoglobulin gene and T cell receptor β chain gene rearrangement flank the V and J segments of this family. The linkage of two of the three V gene segments has been determined: the segments lie approximately 2.5 kb apart, and are arranged head-to-head. The inverted arrangement may cast light upon the mechanisms utilized by lymphocytes for gene rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1526016286,"The uptake of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated apolipoprotein A-I and cholesterol esters was estimated in 16 tissues of the rat using rat HDL doubly labeled with nondegradable tracers; covalently attached 125I-tyramine-cellobiose traced apo-A-I, and [3H]cholesteryl linoleyl ether traced cholesterol esters. Both labels remained associated with the HDL fraction in the plasma, adequately traced their unlabeled counterparts, and were well trapped at their sites of uptake. Cholesteryl ether was taken up at a greater fractional rate than apo-A-I by adrenal, ovary, and liver: 7-fold, 4-fold, and 2-fold greater, respectively. The rates of uptake of cholesteryl ether and apo-A-I were about equal in the other tissues (except kidney). The disproportionate uptake of HDL cholesteryl ether relative to HDL apo-A-I was also observed in primary cultures of rat adrenal cells and hepatocytes. Uptake of both moieties in both cell types showed saturability. Both the absolute rate of uptake of [3H]cholesteryl ether and the ratio of ether uptake to apo-A-I uptake were greater in adrenal cells than in hepatocytes, consonant with the in vivo observations. Very similar results were obtained using HDL biologically labeled with [3H]cholesterol esters. The disproportionate uptake of [3H]cholesteryl ether was not significantly decreased by depletion of apo-E from the HDL nor by reductive methylation of the apo-E to block its recognition by receptors. However, apo-A-I uptake was decreased, suggesting that apo-E mediates the uptake of particles containing apo-A-I but does not contribute to the disproportionate uptake of [3H]cholesteryl ether."
https://openalex.org/W2014549199,"The chicken immunoglobulin lambda locus contains a single C lambda gene with a unique J lambda element, 1.9 kb upstream. The same V lambda gene (V lambda 1) is rearranged in most cells of the Bursa of Fabricius. This V lambda 1 gene is located, in germ-line configuration, 1.7 kb upstream from J lambda and in the same transcriptional orientation. Eight to twelve variable genes of the same set are found adjacent to the V lambda 1 gene, indicating that V-gene amplification did occur. Three of these genes were sequenced and proved to be pseudogenes, one of them having an inverted polarity. Data suggesting extensive somatic diversification of the V lambda 1 sequence are reported, including the possible use of nonfunctional V elements in a somatic gene-conversion-like process."
https://openalex.org/W2026323020,"The achaete-scute gene complex (AS-C), involved in differentiation of the sensory chaetes of D. melanogaster, and the yellow locus have been cloned. The yellow locus is the most distal and is followed, proximally, by the achaete and the scute loci. In the scute locus (75 kb), three transcription units separated by long stretches of DNA give rise to poly(A)+ RNAs of 1.6, 1.2, and 1.6 kb. Most DNA lesions associated with scute mutations map within the presumably untranscribed DNA. Their mutant phenotypes are stronger the closer the lesions are to the structural gene of one transcript (T4 RNA). Genetic and developmental data suggest that only this RNA is fundamental for the scute function. Its transcription might be perturbed by far removed DNA lesions. A second transcript is probably implicated in the lethal of scute embryonic function, while the third transcript is unnecessary for the differentiation of most macrochaetes. Two additional polyadenylated RNAs are transcribed from the achaete (1.1 kb) and yellow (1.9 kb) loci."
https://openalex.org/W1971285426,"Enhancer sequences are regulatory regions that greatly increase transcription of certain eukaryotic genes. An immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene segment is moved from a region lacking enhancer activity to a position adjacent to the known heavy-chain enhancer early in B-cell maturation. In lymphoid cells, the heavy-chain and SV40 enhancers bind a common factor essential for enhancer function. In contrast, fibroblast cells contain a functionally distinct factor that is used by the SV40 but not by the heavy-chain enhancer. The existence of different factors in these cells may explain the previously described lymphoid cell specificity of the heavy-chain enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W2052692052,"The transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, p60src, was shown to be acylated at its amino terminus with the long-chain fatty acid myristic acid by isolation of a tryptic peptide with the following structure: myristylglycylserylseryllysine. The occurrence of this unusual posttranslational modification in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase and in several transforming protein kinases of mammalian retroviruses suggests that myristylation of the amino terminal glycyl residue may be critical for the function of certain proteins related to cell transformation and growth control."
https://openalex.org/W1576019602,"The effect of dolichols, polyprenols, dolichol esterified with fatty acids, and dolichyl phosphate on the structure and fluidity of model membranes was studied using 31P NMR, small-angle x-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. These studies suggest that dolichol and dolichol derivatives destabilize unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine containing bilayer structures and promote hexagonal II phase formation; high concentrations of dolichol induce lipid structures characterized by isotropic 31P NMR and particulate fracture faces; dolichol, contrary to cholesterol, has no effect on the thermotropic behavior of membranes consisting of phosphatidylcholine, while dolichyl-P incorporation abolishes the transition from the gel to liquid crystalline phase in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; both dolichol and dolichyl-P increase the fatty acid fluidity in phosphatidylethanolamine mixtures; the effect of dolichol on bilayer structure and fluidity is more pronounced with increasing number of isoprene residues; dolichol esters are only soluble to a limited extent in the bilayer and segregates into domains at low concentrations; the results are consistent with a localization of dolichyl-P in which the phosphate group is oriented to the water interphase. The induction of hexagonal II phase by dolichyl-P may elicit the transmembrane movement of glycosylated lipid intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2019436085,"Isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium and alpha-tocopherol succinate with three different toxic chemicals; namely, adriamycin in combination with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, ethyl methanesulfonate, and the calcium ionophore A23187. In the absence of extracellular calcium these three compounds were far more toxic to the cells than in its presence. The addition of vitamin E to calcium-free medium, however, protected hepatocytes against toxic injury, whereas cells incubated in medium containing calcium were not protected. Hepatocyte viability during each toxic insult correlated well with the cellular alpha-tocopherol content but not with the presence or absence of extracellular calcium. These results suggest that cellular alpha-tocopherol maintains the viability of the cell during a toxic insult and that the presence or absence of vitamin E in the incubation medium probably explains the conflicting reports on the role of extracellular calcium in toxic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1541482973,"Human C1-inhibitor (C1-Inh) forms an equimolar complex with complement proteinase C1s that is resistant to dissociation by sodium dodecyl sulfate. The formation of this stable complex results in the cleavage of a peptide bond near the carboxyl terminus of the inhibitor and, whereas the bulk of C1-Inh remains covalently bound to the light chain of C1s, the postcomplex inhibitor peptide can be isolated under denaturing conditions. We have sequenced the amino-terminal region of this peptide and deduced that it represents the carboxyl-terminal side of the reactive site of C1-Inh. Limited proteolysis of C1-Inh by Crotalus atrox protease results in an active derivative lacking an amino-terminal peptide of 36 residues. Further proteolysis of this derivative with Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase inactivates the inhibitor and a peptide is released. The amino-terminal sequence of this peptide overlaps with that of the postcomplex peptide and indicates that the residue imparting primary specificity to the inhibitor is arginine."
https://openalex.org/W1998298704,"Two independent methods were used to identify the mouse chromosomes on which are located two families of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like genes that are rearranged and expressed in T lymphocytes. The genes coding for the alpha subunit of T-cell receptors are on chromosome 14 and the gamma genes, whose function is yet to be determined, are on chromosome 13. Since genes for the T-cell receptor beta chain were previously shown to be on mouse chromosome 6, all three of the Ig-like multigene families expressed and rearranged in T cells are located on different chromosomes, just as are the B-cell multigene families for the Ig heavy chain, and the Ig kappa and lambda light chains. The findings do not support earlier contentions that genes for T-cell receptors are linked to the Ig heavy chain locus (mouse chromosome 12) or to the major histocompatibility complex (mouse chromosome 17)."
https://openalex.org/W1543528031,"[3H]PAF (platelet activating factor or 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC) is converted to 1-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC and 1-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC by rabbit platelets (GPC is sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). The deacetylation reaction does not involve the transfer of the acetate of PAF to any other lipid class and added exogenous lyso-PAF readily mixes with the cellular pool of the [3H]lyso-PAF intermediate formed from [3H]PAF. [3H]1-Alkyl-2-acyl-GPC produced during the inactivation of [3H]PAF contained primarily the tetraenoic acyl species (approximately 80% of the 3H in this fraction). The source of the arachidonic acid used for the reacylation of the lyso-PAF intermediate is the diacyl species, phosphatidylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W1541248284,"The oxidation of aminopyrine to an aminopyrine cation radical was investigated using a solubilized microsomal preparation or prostaglandin H synthase purified from ram seminal vesicles. Aminopyrine was oxidized to an aminopyrine cation radical in the presence of arachidonic acid, hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide or 15-hydroperoxyarachidonic acid. Highly purified prostaglandin H synthase, which processes both cyclo-oxygenase and hydroperoxidase activity, oxidized aminopyrine to the free radical. Purified prostaglandin H synthase reconstituted with Mn2+ protoporphyrin IX, which processes only cyclo-oxygenase activity, did not catalyze the formation of the aminopyrine free radical. Aminopyrine stimulated the reduction of 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid to 15-hydroxy-5,8,11-13-eicosatetraenoic acid. Approximately 1 molecule of 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid was reduced for every 2 molecules of aminopyrine free radical formed, giving a stoichiometry of 1:2. The decay of the aminopyrine radical obeyed second-order kinetics. These results support the proposed mechanism in which aminopyrine is oxidized by prostaglandin H synthase hydroperoxidase to the aminopyrine free radical, which then disproportionates to the iminium cation. The iminium cation is further hydrolyzed to the demethylated amine and formaldehyde. Glutathione reduced the aminopyrine radical to aminopyrine with the concomitant oxidation of GSH to its thiyl radical as detected by ESR of the glutathione thiyl radical adduct."
https://openalex.org/W1600820011,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates prolactin (PRL) gene expression in GH3 cells in a Ca2+-dependent manner (White, B. A., and Bancroft, F. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4618-4622). The present report shows that the phenothiazine, calmidazolium (compound R 24571), blocks the ability of EGF plus Ca2+ to increase levels of PRL mRNA. Calmidazolium inhibition of this response is dose dependent in the range of 0.05-1.00 microM. Total inhibition of the response was consistently obtained at a level of calmidazolium (0.5 microM) that had no effect on total cytoplasmic RNA synthesis, total cytoplasmic protein synthesis, cell viability, or extent of EGF plus Ca2+-induced cell aggregation. The drug inhibited the increase in PRL mRNA when given immediately before or 48 h after treatment with EGF plus Ca2+. Another calmodulin inhibitor, W13, similarly blocked the ability of EGF plus Ca2+ to stimulate PRL mRNA, whereas the less active analog, W12, had little effect. These results implicate Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulin in the mechanism of action of EGF in GH3 cells, and, therefore, provide further evidence for a role of intracellular Ca2+ in the regulation of the expression of a specific eukaryotic gene, the PRL gene."
https://openalex.org/W2050908220,"We have developed an in vivo RNA splicing assay for the self-splicing rRNA intron of Tetrahymena thermophila using E. coli as the host. A DNA fragment containing the intron sequence has been cloned into M13mp83 so that expression of the beta-galactosidase alpha-fragment is dependent upon intron excision from the mRNA precursor. Plaque phenotypes correlate well with levels of excised intron RNA. Point mutations were made by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in conserved sequences P, Q, and S. All showed reduced splicing, agreeing with mitochondrial genetic data for S and providing the first direct evidence that P and Q are functionally important. The results support the hypothesis that base-pairing of R with S and P with Q is important for intron structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2118321673,"The activity of an ethanolamine and serine base exchange enzyme of rat brain microsomes was copurified to near homogeneity. The purification sequence involved detergent solubilization, Sepharose 4B column chromatography, phenyl-Sepharose 4B column chromatography, glycerol gradient sedimentation, and agarose-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions. The ratio of the ethanolamine and serine base exchange activities remained almost constant during purification, and both enzyme activities were enriched 25-fold over the initial microsomal suspension. The final enzyme preparation which contained both enzyme activities showed a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, having an apparent molecular mass of about 100 kDa. Serine inhibited the ethanolamine incorporation by this preparation and ethanolamine inhibited the serine incorporation. The competitive nature of this inhibition was apparent from Lineweaver-Burk plots, suggesting that the enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of both ethanolamine and serine into their corresponding phospholipids. The Km and Ki values for ethanolamine were quite similar, being 0.02 and 0.025 mM, respectively. The Km and Ki values for serine were also quite similar being 0.11 and 0.12 mM, respectively. The pH optimum was the same at 7.0 with both substrates. The optimum Ca2+ concentration was 8 mM for serine incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W1593690817,"Sulfonylureas potentiate the insulin-induced stimulation of glucose transport in adipocytes. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this potentiation, effects of a long-term (48-h) incubation with glyburide (2 micrograms/ml) on the relative sizes of the plasma membrane, the microsome, and the total membrane pools of the glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding were studied for basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes. The drug treatment potentiated an insulin-induced stimulation of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose flux by 31 to 45%, with little effect on the basal flux. The same drug treatment increased the plasma membrane pool size of the glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding in the insulin-stimulated adipocytes with a concomitant decrease in the microsomal pool size. This effect was minimal, if any, in basal adipocytes. The drug treatment did not affect the total glucose-sensitive, cytochalasin B binding capacity of adipocyte membranes. These results indicate that the drug treatment increases the insulin-induced recruitment of the glucose carrier from the microsome to the plasma membrane by 27-31%. It is concluded that potentiation of the insulin-induced stimulation of the hexose transport by sulfonylureas is mainly due to a potentiation of the insulin-induced recruitment of the glucose carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1517980505,"A nondisruptive technique developed by Bellomo et al. (Bellomo, G., Jewell, S. A., Thor, H., and Orrenius, S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 6842-6846) has been used to examine the distribution of calcium ions between mitochondrial and extramitochondrial compartments in the perfused rat liver. The amount of calcium released by the uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol from the mitochondrial compartment was 19 +/- 2 nmol X g-1, wet weight, which is equivalent to a total calcium concentration of 3.5 X 10(-4) M in the mitochondria and is by several orders of magnitude smaller than the concentration thought to be present in these organelles. The amount of calcium released from the liver in the presence of the divalent cation ionophore A 23187 was 96 +/- 7 nmol X g-1, wet weight, which is of the same order of magnitude as the amount released by the calcium-dependent hormone vasopressin (97 +/- 11 nmol X g-1, wet weight). Experiments with different sequential combinations of hormone with uncoupler or ionophore reveal that in the perfused liver, in contrast to isolated hepatocytes or isolated mitochondria, the amount of calcium attributable to the mitochondria is too small to account for the calcium released during hormonal stimulation. Consequently extramitochondrial calcium stores are the main source of cellular calcium mobilized under this condition. In addition these findings imply that in the liver several mitochondrial enzymes, e.g. alpha-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, can be effectively regulated by calcium and that the role of mitochondria in buffering the cytosolic free calcium in vivo has to be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W1508017329,"Procollagen N-proteinase, the enzyme which cleaves the NH2-terminal propeptides from type I procollagen, was purified over 15,000-fold from extracts of chick embryos by chromatography on columns of DEAE-cellulose, concanavalin A-agarose, heparin-agarose, pN-collagen-agarose, and a filtration gel. The purified enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 320,000 as estimated by gel filtration and a pH optimum for activity of 7.4 to 9.0. The enzyme was inhibited by metal chelators and the thiol reagent dithiothreitol. Addition of calcium was required for maximal activity under the standard assay conditions, and the presence of calcium decreased thermal inactivation at 37 degrees C. The purified enzyme cleaved a homotrimer of pro-alpha 1(I) chains, an observation which indicated that the presence of pro-alpha 2(I) chain is not essential for the enzymic cleavage of NH2-terminal propeptides. Previous observations suggesting that the enzyme requires a substrate with a native conformation were explored further by reacting the enzyme with type I procollagen at different temperatures. Type I procollagen from chick embryo fibroblasts became resistant to cleavage at about 43 degrees C. Type I procollagen from human skin fibroblasts, which was previously shown to have a slightly lower thermal stability than chick embryo type I procollagen, became resistant to cleavage at temperatures that were about 2 degrees C lower. The results suggested that the enzyme is a sensitive probe for the three-dimensional structure of the NH2-terminal region of the procollagen molecule and that it requires the protein substrate to be triple helical."
https://openalex.org/W2010672315,Eleven mangabey monkeys inoculated with Mycobacterium leprae developed lepromatous-type leprosy. Nine of the mangabeys were inoculated with M. leprae isolated from a mangabey with naturally acquired lepromatous leprosy. Immune function was depressed in some of these animals after dissemination of the disease. Two mangabeys developed lepromatous leprosy after inoculation with human M. leprae passaged in an armadillo. Three rhesus and three African green monkeys inoculated with mangabey-derived M. leprae also developed lepromatous leprosy. Mangabeys may be the first reported nonhuman primate model for the study of leprosy. Rhesus and African green monkeys may also prove to be reproducibly susceptible to the disease.
https://openalex.org/W1484094378,"MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells infected with the NWS strain of influenza virus incorporate 35SO4 into complex types of oligosaccharides of the N-linked glycoproteins. On the other hand, when these virus-infected MDCK cells are incubated in the presence of swainsonine, an inhibitor of the processing mannosidase II, approximately 40-80% of the total [35S]glycopeptides were of the hybrid types of structures. Thus, these sulfated, hybrid types of glycopeptides were completely susceptible to digestion by endoglucosaminidase H, whereas the sulfated glycopeptides from infected cells incubated without swainsonine were completely resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. When virus-infected MDCK cells were incubated in the presence of castanospermine, an inhibitor of the processing glucosidase I, the N-linked glycopeptides contained mostly oligosaccharide chains of the Glc3Man7-9GlcNAc2 types of structures, and these oligosaccharides were devoid of sulfate. Structural analysis of these abnormally processed oligosaccharides produced in the presence of swainsonine or castanospermine indicated that they differed principally in the processing of one oligosaccharide branch as indicated by the structures shown below. They also differed in that only the swainsonine-induced structures were sulfated. These data indicate that removal of glucose units and perhaps other processing steps are necessary before sulfate residues can be added. (Formula: see text)."
https://openalex.org/W1491858567,"Ovaries of immature, intact rats were dispersed by collagenase-DNase treatment and cultured in serum-free medium (ovarian cell culture). The hormonal responsiveness of the ovarian cell was compared to that exhibited by pure granulosa cells isolated via needle puncturing. Surprisingly, despite the fact that the majority of the cultured cells should have been comprised of granulosa type, no follicle-stimulating hormone-inducible progesterone or 20 alpha-OH-progesterone (20 alpha-OH-P) could be detected by radioimmunoassay, as typically occurs in cultures of pure granulosa cells. Therefore, in order to unravel the cause for the different responsiveness between the granulosa and the ovarian cell, we applied thin-layer chromatography analysis to follow the metabolic fate of added radioactive pregnenolone to intact monolayers in culture. Such TLC analysis revealed that, after priming with follicle-stimulating hormone, added [3H]pregnenolone was converted to progesterone which was rapidly reduced and finally accumulated as 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol(pregnanediol). In addition to pregnanediol, a second class of steroid hormones accumulated in the coculture medium, namely androsterone and 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha,17 alpha,20 alpha-triol (pregnanetriol). These latter two were specific products of the ovarian coculture, indicating the presence of theca-interstitial cells bearing 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. Pregnanediol, rather than progesterone, was found to be the progestin precursor for androgen formation. We thus conclude that due to exchange of steroid metabolites between the cocultured cell types, the final steroid products are different by far from the expected contributions of each individually cultured cell type. Moreover, these findings reveal an additional aspect of the two-cell theory, suggesting a granulosa-thecal concerted metabolism of progestin steroids, rather than exchange of aromatizable androgens."
https://openalex.org/W1618696361,"A rainbow trout serum protein that is cross-reactive with the third complement component of rainbow trout (C3-1) was purified to homogeneity and its structural and functional properties compared with those of C3-1. This protein (termed C3-related protein: C3-2) bears a close structural resemblance to C3-1, although C3-2 apparently shows no hemolytic activity. Like C3-1, C3-2 consists of two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains (128,000 alpha and 72,000 beta) and retains the unique thiol ester site in the alpha-chain. C3-2 shares some antigenicity with C3-1, but it also displays distinctive antigenic determinants of its own. Comparison of tryptic peptide maps revealed that about 20% of the peptides was specific to either C3-1 or C3-2, and about 80% of the peptides were common to both proteins. Amino acid compositions of the alpha- and beta-chains of C3-2 were similar to those of C3-1. Furthermore, amino acid sequence analysis of the NH2 termini of the alpha- and beta-chains of C3-2 revealed a high degree of homology with those of C3-1, 24 of 26 residues in the alpha-chain and all 20 in the beta-chain of C3-2 were identical with those found in C3-1. Both C3-1 and C3-2 were detected in all the adult rainbow trout tested and in first generation offspring randomly bred from them."
https://openalex.org/W1578758927,"Abstract We have shown that arachidonic acid stimulates 45Ca2+ efflux from prelabeled rat pituitary mammotropic (GH3) cells resuspended in Ca2+-free medium (Kolesnick, R. N., Mussachio, I., Thaw, C., and Gershengorn, M. C. (1984) Am. J. Physiol. 246, E458-E462). In this study, we further characterize the effects of arachidonic acid on Ca2+ homeostasis in GH3 cells and demonstrate its antagonism of changes induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). At below 5 microM, arachidonic acid stimulated intracellular for extracellular Ca2+ exchange without affecting cell Ca2+ content. Above 5 microM, arachidonic acid decreased membrane-bound Ca2+, as monitored by chlortetracycline, and decreased total cell 45Ca2+ content by depleting nonmitochondrial and mitochondrial pools. However, arachidonic acid did not elevate cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Arachidonic acid inhibited TRH-induced 45Ca2+ efflux, loss of membrane-bound Ca2+, mobilization of nonmitochondrial Ca2+, and elevation of [Ca2+]i. Arachidonic acid also lowered elevated [Ca2+]i caused by release of mitochondrial Ca2+ with an uncoupler or by influx of extracellular Ca2+ stimulated with K+ depolarization. Hence, arachidonic acid stimulates Ca2+ extrusion from and depletes Ca2+ stores within GH3 cells. We suggest that arachidonic acid may be an important regulator of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis which may inhibit TRH-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1578085124,"Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated to divide by human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were used to investigate cell cycle-dependent changes in arachidonic acid, stearic acid, and glycerol metabolism. PDGF at 12 ng/ml stimulated incorporation of labeled arachidonic and stearic acid into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol within 60 min. With similar kinetics PDGF stimulated glycerol incorporation into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol indicating early growth factor-dependent stimulation of de novo phosphatidylinositol synthesis. This early effect of PDGF was specific for the phosphatidylinositol synthesis pathway since no comparable changes were noted in other glycerolipids. After a lag of 4-6 h, PDGF strongly stimulated arachidonic acid incorporation into triacylglycerol: at 6 h, arachidonate radioactivity in triacylglycerol exceeded that in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. This effect of PDGF was not associated with de novo triacylglycerol synthesis since no increase in the rate of glycerol incorporation into this lipid was noted. Finally, PDGF stimulated incorporation of glycerol into all major phospholipids and triacylglycerol during S-phase. These results disclose three novel effects of PDGF on glycerolipid metabolism in Swiss 3T3 cells: 1) early selective activation of the phosphatidylinositol synthesis pathway; 2) delayed strong stimulation of arachidonic acid incorporation into triacylglycerol; and 3) late induction of de novo phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol synthesis. These PDGF effects are likely to play important roles in phosphatidylinositol metabolism, membrane biosynthesis, and fatty acid turnover in rapidly growing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555734377,"Diploid human infant skin fibroblasts cultured from normal infants and Gaucher disease infants, with genetically defective lysosomal glucosylceramide:beta-glucohydrolase activity, had a full range of homologous glycosphingolipids from the simplest (glucosylceramide) to higher neutral derivatives (lactosyl-, trihexosyl- and tetrahexosylceramide) and anionic sialo derivatives (gangliosides) (sialosyllactosyl-, disialosyllactosyl-, sialosylgangliotriaosyl-, and mono- and disialosylgangliotetraosylceramide). Although excessive storage of glucosylceramide in histiocytes is pathognomonic for Gaucher disease, we found that Gaucher disease fibroblasts contained 1.23 +/- 0.08 nmol of glucosylceramide/mg cell protein; normal infant cells, 1.11 +/- 0.48. When we aged infantile Gaucher disease fibroblasts for 20 days beyond their confluency state, we found no increased accumulation of glucosylceramide, but a 1.5-2-fold increase in trihexosylceramide, sialosylgangliotetraosylceramide, and disialosyllactosylceramide. Gaucher disease fibroblasts took up and could not degrade but, instead, effectively converted pulse-chase 3-O-[3H]glucosylceramide supplied in the growth medium in liposomes into higher glycosphingolipids, especially the plasma membrane ganglioside, sialosyllactosylceramide. When grown with extracellular particulate [3H]glucosylceramide, infantile Gaucher fibroblasts localized it and higher labeled homologues in the plasma membrane; glucosylceramide did not accumulate in the lysosomes. These findings indicate that fibroblasts that are genetically deficient in lysosomal glucosylceramide:beta-glucosidase avoid pathological lysosomal accumulation by relegating undegradable glucosylceramide to an anabolic compartment where glucosylceramide is converted into more highly glycosylated glycosphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1550836509,"Abstract Ca2+-dependent phospholipases A require Ca2+ concentrations in the millimolar range for optimal activity toward artificial substrates. Because Ca2+-dependent phospholipases A2 degrade the phospholipids of Escherichia coli, treated with the membrane-active antibiotic polymixin B equally well with and without added Ca2+ (Weiss, J., Beckerdite-Quagliata, S., and Elsbach, P. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11010-11014), we have examined the possibility that intramembrane Ca2+ can provide the Ca2+ needed for phospholipase action. We studied the effect of Ca2+ depletion on the hydrolysis of the phospholipids of polymixin B-killed E. coli by 1) added pig pancreas phospholipase A2 in E. coli S17 (a phospholipase A-lacking mutant) and 2) endogenous Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A1 in the parent strain E. coli S15. Transfer of E. coli from nutrient broth (Ca2+ concentration approximately 3 X 10(-5) M) to Ca2+-depleted medium (Ca2+ concentration less than 10(-6)M) reduced polymixin B-induced hydrolysis by 50-75%, in parallel with a reduction of bacterial Ca2+ from 19.6 +/- 2.8 to 3.9 +/- 0.6 nmol (mean +/- standard error) per 3 X 10(10) bacteria. The bacterial Ca2+ content was repleted and the sensitivity of the bacterial phospholipids to hydrolysis by both exogenous phospholipase A2 (E. coli S17) and endogenous phospholipase A (E. coli S15) was restored by adding Ca2+ back to the suspensions. Complete restoration occurred at low Ca2+ levels in the reaction mixture (3 X 10(-5) - 10(-4) M) and required time, suggesting that hydrolysis was restored because bacterial Ca2+ stores were gradually replenished and not because extracellular Ca2+ concentrations were raised to levels that were still at least 10X lower than needed for optimal phospholipase A activity. This conclusion is supported by the finding that Ca2+ depletion or addition caused respectively decreased and increased release of lipopolysaccharides by EGTA (ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid), suggesting that the bacterial Ca2+ pool bound to lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane shrinks or expands depending on extracellular Ca2+ levels. Thus, the cationic membrane-disruptive polymixin B, thought to compete with Mg2+ and Ca2+ for the same anionic sites on lipopolysaccharides, may liberate the Ca2+ near where the phospholipids are exposed to phospholipase."
https://openalex.org/W1564892135,"Abstract The gene for Bacillus cereus 569/H beta-lactamase I, penPC, has recently been cloned and sequenced (Mezes, P. S. F., Yang, Y. Q., Hussain, M., and Lampen, J. O. (1983) FEBS Lett. 161, 195-200). A typical prokaryotic signal peptide but with no lipoprotein modification site, as present in the Bacillus licheniformis 749/C beta-lactamase, was indicated by the DNA sequence for this secretory protein. We have here purified the beta-lactamase I products found in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis carrying penPC and have determined the first 20 NH2-terminal amino acids of each of the forms. Processing of the beta-lactamase I in E. coli occurs at a single site which is characteristic for cleavage by a signal peptidase. B. subtilis secreted two distinct products to the culture medium which were both smaller than the single product formed in E. coli. Sequencing of [35S]Met-labeled pre-beta-lactamase I from phenylethyl alcohol-treated cells of B. cereus 569/H indicated that UUG is being utilized as the initiation codon for penPC. The same result was obtained for the pre-beta-lactamase I from similarly treated cells of the closely related B. cereus 5/B strain."
https://openalex.org/W1595558935,"Bacillus subtilis sigma 28-specific promoters (P28) are utilized by a minor form of B. subtilis RNA polymerase (sigma 28RNA polymerase) and not by the predominant RNA polymerases of B. subtilis (sigma 43 RNA polymerase) or Escherichia coli (sigma 70 RNA polymerase). However B. subtilis P28 are effective promoters in E. coli. This transcription depends on the E. coli htpR+ gene. Similarly, the E. coli rpoD heat shock promoter which is under control of htpR is used in vitro by B. subtilis sigma 28 RNA polymerase. These observations are explained by the fact that E. coli htpR is a minor sigma factor (sigma 32) which shares an overlapping promoter specificity with B. subtilis sigma 28 RNA polymerase. Hence control of bacterial regulons by minor sigma factors is not restricted to Bacilli, or bacteria that carry out a complex differentiation process, but is probably a general, regulatory mechanism in prokaryotes. Transcription from B. subtilis P28 in E. coli does not depend on a heat shock. This suggests that the sequences that control E. coli sigma 32 action are separate from those that control the heat shock regulon. Hence the action of polymerases controlled by minor sigma factors in both B. subtilis and E. coli appears to be controlled by a separate set of regulatory factors."
https://openalex.org/W1500055799,"Use was made of the asialoglycoprotein receptor system in a perfused rat liver in order to study lysosomal degradation and subsequent metabolism of radioactive derivatives of asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin and asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. A trace of N-acetyl-D-[6-3H]galactosamine-labeled asialo-ovine submaxillary (4 micrograms) was completely taken up by the tissue in less than 20 min. After 3 h 24% of the radioactivity from the mucin reappeared on newly synthesized serum glycoproteins that were secreted into the perfusate. [6-3H] Galactose asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was also rapidly cleared by the liver; however, after 3 h greater than 60% of the radioactivity derived from this sugar labeled glycoprotein was secreted back into the perfusate as [3H]glucose. Rat livers perfused with 0.15 mM beta-D-galactopyranosylmethyl-p-nitrophenyltriazene lost 90% of their beta-D-galactosidase activity within 1 h while other representative glycosidases showed no change as followed by hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylglycosides. Livers pretreated with this triazene compound metabolized [3H]GalNAc asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin normally but were unable to process [3H]Gal asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein as evidenced by a complete inhibition of [3H]glucose release following addition of the latter substrate. Metabolism of N-acetyl[14C]glucosamine asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was similarly inhibited by 70%. 125I-labeled asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein catabolism was not affected by the chemically induced beta-D-galactosidase deficiency. Subcellular fractionation of inhibitor-treated livers accumulating radioactive carbohydrate showed the majority of the label was associated with a fraction enriched in lysosomes. Analysis of the trapped radioactivity by high resolution Bio-Gel P-4 chromatography revealed nearly intact oligosaccharides minus only the reducing N-acetylglucosamine of the chitobiose core. Direct comparison of these sugar chains with those isolated from human and canine GM1 gangliosidosis liver by silicic acid thin layer chromatography showed those isolated from rat liver to be identical to the major subset of oligosaccharides found in the human disease. In similar experiments in which the galactosyl triazene was replaced by swainsonine, an alpha-D-mannosidase inhibitor, catabolism of [14C]GlcNAc asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein resulted in the accumulation of a single oligosaccharide of the structure. Man3[14C]GlcNAc1. These results demonstrate an endo-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase is active in rat liver lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1518564255,"The metabolism of columbinic acid by various fatty acid oxidizing enzyme systems was studied. A cyclooxygenase product, 9-hydroxy-(5E,10E,12Z)-octadecatrienoic acid, was formed nearly quantitatively by ram seminal vesicle microsomes and in small amounts by washed human platelets. The major lipoxygenase product from washed human platelets, soybean lipoxygenase, and neonatal rat epidermal homogenate was 13-hydroxy-(5E,9Z,11E)-octadecatrienoic acid, although lesser quantities of other isomers differing in the double bond configurations were also identified by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Topical application of the major lipoxygenase product to paws of essential fatty acid-deficient rats resulted in nearly as complete resolution of the scaly dermatitis as did the application of columbinic acid itself; the cyclooxygenase product was not at all effective."
https://openalex.org/W1566991372,"Previous studies suggested that rabbit liver microsomes contain cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase(s) with low affinity for (omega-1)-hydroxylation and high affinity for omega-hydroxylation of prostaglandins (Theoharides, A. D., and Kupfer, D. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2168-2175). The current investigation describes the isolation from livers of untreated rabbits of a cytochrome P-450 catalyzing, with regioselectivity, the omega-hydroxylation of prostaglandins E1 and E2. The isolation of the enzyme involved enrichment of the omega-hydroxylase activity by polyethylene glycol 8000 fractionation, followed by ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Based on Mr of 59,000-60,000 from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the isolated enzyme is referred to as P-450 form 7. This P-450 exhibits a low spin spectrum (lambda max = 417 nm) and a difference spectrum of the CO-reduced complex versus reduced (lambda max = 451 nm). For catalytic activity, the P-450 form 7 was reconstituted with NADPH-P-450 reductase, cytochrome b5, and lipid. There was no activity in the absence of the reductase, and deletion of cytochrome b5 yielded a minimal amount of product (heme could not substitute for cytochrome b5), demonstrating an absolute requirement for these components."
https://openalex.org/W1678712701,"6-Fluoropyridoxal phosphate (6-FPLP) has been synthesized. Its properties were studied, and it was used, along with 6-fluoropyridoxal (6-FPAL), to reconstitute apophosphorylase b. Kinetic studies of the resulting enzymes showed that phosphorylases reconstituted with 6-FPLP and 6-FPAL have characteristics similar to those of native and pyridoxal enzymes, respectively, except that the former two enzymes have lower Vmax values. 19F NMR and UV spectra of 6-FPLP phosphorylase showed that the coenzyme forms a neutral enolimine Schiff base. Because the UV and fluorescence spectra of 6-FPLP phosphorylase are comparable to those obtained with native phosphorylase, it further confirms the postulate that pyridoxal phosphate forms a neutral enolimine Schiff base in phosphorylase. The results suggest that the 3-OH group is protonated and the pyridine nitrogen unprotonated in both 6-FPLP phosphorylase and native enzyme. 19F NMR study of 6-FPLP- and 6-FPAL-reconstituted phosphorylases in the inactive and active states indicates that the protein structure near the coenzyme binding site undergoes certain changes when these enzymes are activated by the substrates and AMP. The comparison of the properties of 6-FPLP-reconstituted and native phosphorylases implies that the ring nitrogen of the coenzyme PLP in phosphorylase may interact with the protein during catalysis, and this interaction is important for efficient catalysis by phosphorylase."
https://openalex.org/W1500386244,"Abstract When the enzymatically generated intermediate 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate (II) was used as a substrate with fresh enzyme, 70% reacted to produce 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA). When a reaction mixture of enzyme plus [1-32P]ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) was quenched in the steady state with the tightly bound inhibitor 2-carboxyarabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate, 30% of the enzyme-bound species was released as 3PGA and 70% as RuBP. The major source for this partition was the ternary substrates Michaelis complex. The level of carboxylated intermediate in the steady state was determined to be 8% of active sites under the conditions of substrate saturation. No burst was seen in the appearance of product when 6.5 eq of [1-32P]RuBP was mixed with enzyme plus saturating CO2 and the reaction followed in the steady state. From these data plus the steady-state Vmax and Km of RuBP it is possible to derive the five bulk rate constants represented in the scheme ECO2 + RuBP in equilibrium ERuBPCO2 in equilibrium E X II----E + 2(3PGA)."

All the complexes, prepared by the sodium cholate dialysis method, were found to be very similar in size, lipid/apolipoprotein stoichiometry, and apolipoprotein spectral properties to the small discoidal complexes without any dihexadecyl PC, described previously (Jonas, A., and Matz, C.E. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 6867-6872; Jonas, A., and McHugh, H. T. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 794, 361-372). The kinetic results presented in the form of double reciprocal plots of initial velocity against bulk PC or interfacial PC concentration were linear according to the Verger et al. kinetic model (Verger, R., Mieras, M. C. E., and de Haas, G. H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4023-4034) for an initial enzyme binding via an interfacial recognition site followed by interfacial substrate binding and catalysis, in the presence of a competitive interfacial inhibitor. The results indicate, furthermore, that the affinity of the active site for the substrate and inhibitor is quite similar."
https://openalex.org/W1602321799,"The structure of the human T lymphocyte surface antigen T8 (Leu 2) has been explored utilizing limited proteolysis on viable cells and cellular lysates. The positions of the cleavage sites of trypsin and papain were placed relative to the single CNBr cleavage point. Additional data allowed the location of the amino and carboxyl termini relative to the enzymatic and chemical cleavage sites. This information, together with earlier evidence concerning the position of a membrane binding site, allowed the construction of a model illustrating the vectorial orientation of the molecule on the cell. Within this model, the approximate positions of disulfide linkages were indicated based on the results of nonreduced/reduced two-dimensional sodium sulfide-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Carbohydrate moieties were localized using cleavage with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, a reagent which cleaves both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides. Finally, the implications of the proteolysis experiments in relation to the function of T8 were discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1547248550,"Hydrophobic glass beads with well characterized physical properties were used as a model system to study at the amphiphilic interface the properties of apolipoproteins A-I and A-II from human serum high density lipoproteins. In this study, spherical glass beads with known diameter were coated covalently with a film of silicone to varying surface density. The decrease in surface tension induced by coating was directly related to the increase in silicone film density and likely to the hydrophobicity of the glass surface. The adsorption of apo-A-I and apo-A-II to the hydrophobic glass bead surface was determined by following the decrease of 1) the radioactivity of preparations of 125I-iodinated proteins from the solution, 2) the UV absorbance of the solution at 206 nm, and 3) the fluorescence emitted by the complex formed between free protein and Fluram II in solution. All of the three measurements gave identical results. Both proteins adsorbed rapidly and reversibly to the hydrophobic glass surface. The adsorption isotherms followed the Langmuir equation with apo-A-II showing a higher surface affinity; delta Gaff = RT ln Kd has a value of -9.1 kcal/mol and -10.5 kcal/mol for apo A-I and apo A-II, respectively. The addition of canine serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) to the above system caused a rapid desorption of apolipoproteins from the beads into the aqueous phase and adsorption onto the HDL surface with no detectable structural changes of this lipoprotein. The results indicate that apo-A-I and apo-A-II can reversibly be adsorbed at a solid hydrophobic surface and that these apoproteins are capable of moving into a HDL particle if added to the system via a solution phase. The data suggest that the rate limiting aspect of the desorption-adsorption processes is the concentration of the apoproteins in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1507409900,"The relationship between the density of adducts on the DNA of monkey kidney cells caused by benzo[a] pyrene diol epoxide (BaP-DE) and the amount of cytotoxicity and DNA synthesis inhibition was examined. Above 1.7 microM, BaP-DE was maximally cytotoxic; whereas, at concentrations below 0.8 microM, colony-forming efficiency was the same as controls even though DNA adducts and DNA synthesis inhibition could be seen at these lower concentrations. Adduct analysis showed a linear relationship between DNA binding and applied BaP-DE concentration with no evidence of parental strand nicking over the concentrations at which adducts were measured. Analysis of nascent DNA synthesis following BaP-DE treatment showed that premature arrest of strand elongation and inhibition of DNA segment maturation were both factors contributing to the decreased level of DNA synthesis caused by BaP-DE. Above 1.7 mM, BaP-DE arrested strand elongation at subreplicon sizes which correlated with the average interadduct distances estimated from DNA binding studies. Lower, nontoxic concentrations permitted the completion of replicons, but inhibited the maturation of these nascent segments. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle distributions of cells after BaP-DE treatment at concentrations which inhibited proper maturation of newly synthesized DNA showed that cells did progress through the G2 phase of the cell cycle and did divide with fragmented newly synthesized DNA. The results of these studies suggest that growth-dependent toxicity is not simply proportional to template adduct level but rather that major toxicity results when adduct levels exceed one/strand/replicon due to the inability of the replication apparatus to complete genome segments containing multiple adducts with replicons."

https://openalex.org/W1511837323,"Pyridoxal(5')diphospho(1)-alpha-D-glucose has been tested as an inhibitor of native glycogen phosphorylases a and b. Its inhibition patterns with respect to substrate, glucose 1-phosphate, and activator, adenosine monophosphate, show it to be a potent (Ki = 40 microM) R-state inhibitor of phosphorylase b, mimicking the binding of glucose-1-phosphate, and, as predicted for an R-state inhibitor, its binding to AMP-activated phosphorylase a is even tighter (Ki = 10 microM). Moreover, it is demonstrated that its binding does not involve covalent imine formation from the pyridoxal aldehyde to an active-site lysine residue. It thus represents the tightest binding R-state inhibitor reported to date, and a 31P NMR study of the effects of binding of this inhibitor upon 31P resonances for the coenzyme phosphate and that of the nucleotide activator is presented. Results obtained are essentially identical to those obtained previously using glucose cyclic 1,2-phosphate, corroborating the previous conclusions. A rationale for the tightness of the binding is presented, as are other possible uses of this compound in studies on glycogen phosphorylase and other similar enzymes."
