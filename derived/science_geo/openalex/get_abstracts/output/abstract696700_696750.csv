https://openalex.org/W4285006295,"Abstract Epigenomic profiling has enabled large-scale identification of regulatory elements, yet we still lack a systematic mapping from any sequence or variant to regulatory activities. We address this challenge with Sei, a framework for integrating human genetics data with sequence information to discover the regulatory basis of traits and diseases. Sei learns a vocabulary of regulatory activities, called sequence classes, using a deep learning model that predicts 21,907 chromatin profiles across &gt;1,300 cell lines and tissues. Sequence classes provide a global classification and quantification of sequence and variant effects based on diverse regulatory activities, such as cell type-specific enhancer functions. These predictions are supported by tissue-specific expression, expression quantitative trait loci and evolutionary constraint data. Furthermore, sequence classes enable characterization of the tissue-specific, regulatory architecture of complex traits and generate mechanistic hypotheses for individual regulatory pathogenic mutations. We provide Sei as a resource to elucidate the regulatory basis of human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4285013803,"Vertebrate genomes organize into topologically associating domains, delimited by boundaries that insulate regulatory elements from nontarget genes. However, how boundary function is established is not well understood. Here, we combine genome-wide analyses and transgenic mouse assays to dissect the regulatory logic of clustered-CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) boundaries in vivo, interrogating their function at multiple levels: chromatin interactions, transcription and phenotypes. Individual CTCF binding site (CBS) deletions revealed that the characteristics of specific sites can outweigh other factors such as CBS number and orientation. Combined deletions demonstrated that CBSs cooperate redundantly and provide boundary robustness. We show that divergent CBS signatures are not strictly required for effective insulation and that chromatin loops formed by nonconvergently oriented sites could be mediated by a loop interference mechanism. Further, we observe that insulation strength constitutes a quantitative modulator of gene expression and phenotypes. Our results highlight the modular nature of boundaries and their control over developmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W4285006522,"Waddington’s epigenetic landscape is a metaphor frequently used to illustrate cell differentiation. Recent advances in single-cell genomics are altering our understanding of the Waddington landscape, yet the molecular mechanisms of cell-fate decisions remain poorly understood. We constructed a cell landscape of mouse lineage differentiation during development at the single-cell level and described both lineage-common and lineage-specific regulatory programs during cell-type maturation. We also found lineage-common regulatory programs that are broadly active during the development of invertebrates and vertebrates. In particular, we identified Xbp1 as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cell-fate determinations across different species. We demonstrated that Xbp1 transcriptional regulation is important for the stabilization of the gene-regulatory networks for a wide range of mouse cell types. Our results offer genetic and molecular insights into cellular gene-regulatory programs and will serve as a basis for further advancing the understanding of cell-fate decisions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of seven mouse developmental stages identifies lineage-specific and shared regulatory programs controlling cell-fate decisions. Cross-species analysis associates differentiation potency with ribosomal protein gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W4285015066,"Gene regulatory networks ensure that important genes are expressed at precise levels. When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors—IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4—in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles about the structure of human gene regulatory networks. Pooled loss-of-function CRISPR screens in primary human T cells identify upstream regulators of IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4. Individual knockouts of 24 regulators of IL2RA define a central network enriched for genes associated with immune-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3168222962,"Electron dynamics in water are of fundamental importance for a broad range of phenomena1-3, but their real-time study faces numerous conceptual and methodological challenges4-6. Here we introduce attosecond size-resolved cluster spectroscopy and build up a molecular-level understanding of the attosecond electron dynamics in water. We measure the effect that the addition of single water molecules has on the photoionization time delays7-9 of water clusters. We find a continuous increase of the delay for clusters containing up to four to five molecules and little change towards larger clusters. We show that these delays are proportional to the spatial extension of the created electron hole, which first increases with cluster size and then partially localizes through the onset of structural disorder that is characteristic of large clusters and bulk liquid water. These results indicate a previously unknown sensitivity of photoionization delays to electron-hole delocalization and indicate a direct link between electronic structure and attosecond photoionization dynamics. Our results offer new perspectives for studying electron-hole delocalization and its attosecond dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4285013480,"Abstract Compelling evidence shows that cancer persister cells represent a major limit to the long-term efficacy of targeted therapies. However, the phenotype and population dynamics of cancer persister cells remain unclear. We developed a quantitative framework to study persisters by combining experimental characterization and mathematical modeling. We found that, in colorectal cancer, a fraction of persisters slowly replicates. Clinically approved targeted therapies induce a switch to drug-tolerant persisters and a temporary 7- to 50-fold increase of their mutation rate, thus increasing the number of persister-derived resistant cells. These findings reveal that treatment may influence persistence and mutability in cancer cells and pinpoint inhibition of error-prone DNA polymerases as a strategy to restrict tumor recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4285006497,"Mapping chromatin loops from noisy Hi-C heatmaps remains a major challenge. Here we present DeepLoop, which performs rigorous bias correction followed by deep-learning-based signal enhancement for robust chromatin interaction mapping from low-depth Hi-C data. DeepLoop enables loop-resolution, single-cell Hi-C analysis. It also achieves a cross-platform convergence between different Hi-C protocols and micrococcal nuclease (micro-C). DeepLoop allowed us to map the genetic and epigenetic determinants of allele-specific chromatin interactions in the human genome. We nominate new loci with allele-specific interactions governed by imprinting or allelic DNA methylation. We also discovered that, in the inactivated X chromosome (Xi), local loops at the DXZ4 'megadomain' boundary escape X-inactivation but the FIRRE 'superloop' locus does not. Importantly, DeepLoop can pinpoint heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms and large structure variants that cause allelic chromatin loops, many of which rewire enhancers with transcription consequences. Taken together, DeepLoop expands the use of Hi-C to provide loop-resolution insights into the genetics of the three-dimensional genome."
https://openalex.org/W4285079062,"This study was designed to understand the molecular mechanisms of azole resistance in Candida tropicalis using genetic and bioinformatics approaches. Thirty-two azole-resistant and 10 azole-susceptible (S) clinical isolates of C . tropicalis were subjected to mutation analysis of the azole target genes including ERG11 . Inducible expression analysis of 17 other genes potentially associated with azole resistance was also evaluated. Homology modeling and molecular docking analysis were performed to study the effect of amino acid alterations in mediating azole resistance. Of the 32 resistant isolates, 12 (37.5%) showed A395T and C461T mutations in the ERG11 gene. The mean overexpression of CDR1 , CDR3 , TAC1 , ERG1 , ERG2 , ERG3 , ERG11 , UPC2 , and MKC1 in resistant isolates without mutation (R-WTM) was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than those with mutation (R-WM) and the sensitive isolates (3.2–11 vs. 0.2–2.5 and 0.3–2.2 folds, respectively). Although the R-WTM and R-WM had higher (p&lt;0.05) CDR2 and MRR1 expression compared to S isolates, noticeable variation was not seen among the other genes. Protein homology modelling and molecular docking revealed that the mutations in the ERG11 gene were responsible for structural alteration and low binding efficiency between ERG11p and ligands. Isolates with ERG11 mutations also presented A220C in ERG1 and together T503C, G751A mutations in UPC2 . Nonsynonymous mutations in the ERG11 gene and coordinated overexpression of various genes including different transporters, ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, transcription factors, and stress-responsive genes are associated with azole resistance in clinical isolates of C . tropicalis ."
https://openalex.org/W4285078780,"Objective Theological beliefs play an important role in cultural norms and could impact women’s prenatal and postpartum decisions in South Asia, which has a high burden of disease in children and pregnant women. The aim of this study is to identify any associations religion may have in affecting a woman’s decision-making ability, and how that in turn affects maternal and child health, at a group level in multiple South Asian countries. Study design Cross-sectional study utilizing secondary data analysis. Methods We used Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) between 2014 and 2018 in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. Not every country’s survey asked about religion, so we imputed these results based on Census data. We assessed maternal and child health through a composite coverage index (CCI), which accounts for family planning, attendance of a skilled attendant at birth, antenatal care, BCG vaccinations, 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, measles vaccine, oral rehydration therapy, and seeking care if the child has pneumonia. The relationship between religion, women’s empowerment, and CCI was assessed through linear regression models. Results The sample included 57,972 mothers who had children aged 12–23 months. CCI is observed to be affected by family income, in addition to religion and country. CCI was higher in Hindus (2.8%, 95% CI: 2.4%, 3.1%) and Buddhists (2.0%, 95% CI: 1.2%, 2.9%) than Muslims. Mother’s age, education, income, decision-making autonomy, and attitude towards beatings were all related to CCI. In a model stratified by religion, age, education, and income were significant predictors of CCI for both Muslims and non-Muslims, but were more impactful among Muslims. Conclusion Though multiple imputation had to be used to fill in gaps in religion data, this study demonstrates that maternal and child health outcomes continue to be a concern in South Asia, especially for Muslim women. Given the importance of religious beliefs, utilizing a simple indicator, such as the CCI could be helpful for monitoring these outcomes and provides a tangible first step for communities to address gaps in care resulting from disparities in maternal empowerment."
https://openalex.org/W4285079087,"Pain and depression are complex disorders that frequently co-occur, resulting in diminished quality of life. The habenula is an epithalamic structure considered to play a pivotal role in the neurocircuitry of both pain and depression. The habenula can be divided into two major areas, the lateral and medial habenula, that can be further subdivided, resulting in 6 main subregions. Here, we investigated habenula activation patterns in a rat model of neuropathic pain with accompanying depressive-like behaviour. Wistar rats received active surgery for the development of neuropathic pain (chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve; CCI), sham surgery (surgical control), or no surgery (behavioural control). All animals were evaluated for mechanical nociceptive threshold using the paw pressure test and depressive-like behaviour using the forced swimming test, followed by evaluation of the immunoreactivity to cFos—a marker of neuronal activity—in the habenula and subregions. The Open Field Test was used to evaluate locomotor activity. Animals with peripheral neuropathy (CCI) showed decreased mechanical nociceptive threshold and increased depressive-like behaviour compared to control groups. The CCI group presented decreased cFos immunoreactivity in the total habenula, total lateral habenula and lateral habenula subregions, compared to controls. No difference was found in cFos immunoreactivity in the total medial habenula, however when evaluating the subregions of the medial habenula, we observed distinct activation patterns, with increase cFos immunoreactivity in the superior subregion and decrease in the central subregion. Taken together, our data suggest an involvement of the habenula in neuropathic pain and accompanying depressive-like behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W4285079374,"According to recent figures from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), since 2006, commercial banks’ non-performing loans (NPLs) have significantly risen. To this end, the primary objective of this research is to explore the impact of NPLs on the operational efficiency of commercial banks in Pakistan. NPLs were incorporated as bad output in the efficiency estimation of 24 CBs for the period 2006–2017. This study employs the data envelopment analysis (DEA) Super-SBM with the undesirable output for the efficiency evaluation of CBs. To test the robustness of our results, we used two different input-output bundles (model A and model B). The findings show a significant difference exists between the results estimated with and without undesirable output. Furthermore, the results of super-efficiency estimation rank the most efficient CB for the study period and distinguish it from other efficient DMUs. Models A and B show that foreign banks are always more efficient than domestic banks, while private CBs have higher efficiency scores than public CBs in domestic banking. In addition, the big five CBs show mixed findings, as in model A, they were more efficient than other domestic CBs, while in model B were less efficient. In the second stage of the empirical study, we use the system GMM to examine the impact of NPLs, bank size, and net interest margin on CBs efficiency. We discovered that NPLs have a negative and significant effect on banking efficiency, whereas bank size and net interest margin positively affect the efficiency of commercial banks in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W4285090708,"The COVID-19 pandemic was severely aggravated in Brazil due to its politicization by the country's federal government. However, the impact of diffuse political forces on the fatality of an epidemic is notoriously difficult to quantify. Here we introduce a method to measure this effect in the Brazilian case, based on the inhomogeneous distribution throughout the national territory of political support for the federal government. This political support is quantified by the voting rates in the last general election in Brazil. This data is correlated with the fatality rates by COVID-19 in each Brazilian state as the number of deaths grows over time. We show that the correlation between fatality rate and political support grows as the government's misinformation campaign is developed. This led to the dominance of such political factor for the pandemic impact in Brazil in 2021. Once this dominance is established, this correlation allows for an estimation of the total number of deaths due to political influence as 350±70 thousand up to the end of 2021, corresponding to (57±11)% of the total number of deaths."
https://openalex.org/W4285020711,"Although both the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and optically measured erythrocyte aggregation parameters are affected by the hematocrit, this interaction is not considered by the method used to estimate ESR that considers aggregation parameters. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the ESR obtained by the Westergren method and that obtained with an aggregation parameter, namely, the aggregation index (AI) of multiple hematocrit values and fibrinogen-spiked samples with an analysis time of 5–60 s, and attempted to develop a rapid and accurate ESR estimation method. The AIs obtained from 5- and 10-s optical measurements with a fixed hematocrit were highly correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation velocity. Furthermore, the rate of the AI increase with an increasing hematocrit was not significantly affected by the fibrinogen concentration at these measurement times. On the basis of these results, we defined the hematocrit-corrected aggregation index (HAI). The exponential function of the HAI obtained from the 5-s measurement agreed well with the sedimentation velocity calculated to eliminate the effect of hindered settling, and the HAI and hematocrit could be used to calculate the time constant of the sedimentation curve with a linear regression equation. The ESR value at 1 h was calculated based on the modified Stokes’ law and the HAI obtained from the 5-s measurement and showed an excellent correlation ( R = 0.966) with the ESR value obtained by the Westergren method over a wide range of hematocrit and fibrinogen concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W4284974624,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major phospho-Ser/Thr phosphatase and a key regulator of cellular signal transduction pathways. While PP2A dysfunction has been linked to human cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), PP2A regulation remains relatively poorly understood. It has been reported that the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) is inactivated by a single phosphorylation at the Tyr307 residue by tyrosine kinases such as v-Src. However, multiple mass spectrometry studies have revealed the existence of other putative PP2Ac phosphorylation sites in response to activation of Src and Fyn, two major Src family kinases (SFKs). Here, using PP2Ac phosphomutants and novel phosphosite-specific PP2Ac antibodies, we show that cellular pools of PP2Ac are instead phosphorylated on both Tyr127 and Tyr284 upon Src activation, and on Tyr284 following Fyn activation. We found these phosphorylation events enhanced the interaction of PP2Ac with SFKs. In addition, we reveal SFK-mediated phosphorylation of PP2Ac at Y284 promotes dissociation of the regulatory Bα subunit, altering PP2A substrate specificity; the phosphodeficient Y127/284F and Y284F PP2Ac mutants prevented SFK-mediated phosphorylation of Tau at the CP13 (pSer202) epitope, a pathological hallmark of AD, and SFK-dependent activation of ERK, a major growth regulatory kinase upregulated in many cancers. Our findings demonstrate a novel PP2A regulatory mechanism that challenges the existing dogma on the inhibition of PP2A catalytic activity by Tyr307 phosphorylation. We propose dysregulation of SFK signaling in cancer and AD can lead to alterations in PP2A phosphorylation and subsequent deregulation of key PP2A substrates, including ERK and Tau."
https://openalex.org/W4285078783,"The design and evaluation of national HIV programs often rely on aggregated national data, which may obscure localized HIV epidemics. In Ethiopia, even though the national adult HIV prevalence has decreased, little information is available about local areas and subpopulations. To inform HIV prevention efforts for specific populations, we identified geographic locations and drivers of HIV transmission. We used data from adults aged 15-64 years who participated in the Ethiopian Population-based HIV Impact Assessment survey (October 2017-April 2018). Location-related information for the survey clusters was obtained from the 2007 Ethiopia population census. Spatial autocorrelation of HIV prevalence data were analyzed via a Global Moran's I test. Geographically weighted regression analysis was used to show the relationship of covariates. The finding indicated that uncircumcised men in certain hotspot towns and divorced or widowed individuals in hotspot woredas/towns might have contributed to the average increase in HIV prevalence in the hotspot areas. Hotspot analysis findings indicated that, localized, context-specific intervention efforts tailored to at-risk populations, such as divorced or widowed women or uncircumcised men, could decrease HIV transmission and prevalence in urban Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4285078890,"Cyp2a12-/-Cyp2c70-/- double knockout (DKO) mice have a human-like hydrophobic bile acid (BA) composition and show reduced fertility and liver injury. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a hydrophilic and cytoprotective BA used to treat various liver injuries in humans. This study investigated the effects of orally administered UDCA on fertility and liver injury in DKO mice. UDCA treatment prevented abnormal delivery (miscarriage and preterm birth) in pregnant DKO mice, presumably by increasing the hydrophilicity of serum BAs. UDCA also prevented liver damage in six-week-old DKO mice, however liver injury emerged in UDCA-treated 20-week-old female, but not male, DKO mice. In 20-week-old male UDCA-treated DKO mice, conjugated plus unconjugated UDCA proportions in serum, liver, and bile were 71, 64, and 71% of the total BAs, respectively. In contrast, conjugated plus unconjugated UDCA proportions in serum, liver, and bile of females were 56, 34, and 58% of the total BAs, respectively. The UDCA proportion was considerably low in female liver only and was compensated by highly hydrophobic lithocholic acid (LCA). Therefore, UDCA treatment markedly reduced the BA hydrophobicity index in the male liver but not in females. This appears to be why UDCA treatment causes liver injury in 20-week-old female mice. To explore the cause of LCA accumulation in the female liver, we evaluated the hepatic activity of CYP3A11 and SULT2A1, which metabolize LCAs to more hydrophilic BAs. However, there was no evidence to suggest that either enzyme activity was lower in females than in males. As female mice have a larger BA pool than males, excessive loading of LCAs on the hepatic bile salt export pump (BSEP) may be the reason for the hepatic accumulation of LCAs in female DKO mice with prolonged UDCA treatment. Our results suggest that the improvement of BA hydrophobicity in DKO mice by UDCA administration is sex-, age-, and organ-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W4285079158,"There is an increasing demand in developing new, effective, and affordable anti-cancer against colon and rectal. In this study, our aim is to identify the potential anthraquinone compounds from the root bark of Morinda citrifolia to be tested in vitro against colorectal cancer cell lines. Eight potential anthraquinone compounds were successfully isolated, purified and tested for both in-silico and in-vitro analyses. Based on the in-silico prediction, two anthraquinones, morindone and rubiadin, exhibit a comparable binding affinity towards multitargets of β-catenin, MDM2-p53 and KRAS. Subsequently, we constructed a 2D interaction analysis based on the above results and it suggests that the predicted anthraquinones from Morinda citrifolia offer an attractive starting point for potential antiproliferative agents against colorectal cancer. In vitro analyses further indicated that morindone and damnacanthal have significant cytotoxicity effect and selectivity activity against colorectal cancer cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W4285078908,"People with pre-existing chronic diseases are more likely to acquire COVID-19 infections, which can be fatal, and die from COVID-19 illness. COVID-19 vaccination will benefit those at a higher risk of developing complications and dying from the disease. This study aimed to determine chronic patients' willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and the factors that influence their willingness.An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 adult chronic patients in the University of Gondar specialized hospital outpatient departments. The participants were chosen using systematic random sampling methods with an interval of 5. Face-to-face interviews were used to collect data from eligible respondents. Epi-data version 4.6 and SPSS version 25 were used for the data entry data analysis. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between the dependent and independent factors. An odds ratio with 95 percent confidence intervals and a P-value was used to determine the association's strength and statistical significance.Out of 401 respondents, 219 (54.6%) with [95% CI (49.7-59.5%)] of study participants were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. Being a healthcare worker (AOR = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.24-6.96), Lost family members or friends due to COVID-19 (AOR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.21-5.00), good knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.37-4.33), favorable attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = .8.56 95% CI: 4.76-15.38), perceived suitability of the COVID-19 infection (AOR = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.62-5.33) and perceived benefit of the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.08-3.31), were found to be a significant association with the willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among chronic patients.This study confirms that around 55% of adult chronic patients were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Providing health education for chronic patients to emphasize the knowledge and attitude of the COVID-19 vaccine and raise patients' perceived risk of COVID-19 and the benefit of the COVID-19 vaccine could be recommended to improve their willingness to COVID-19 vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4285093174,"While previous research using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) suggest that cerebellum (CB) influences the neuroplastic response of primary motor cortex (M1), the role of different indirect (I) wave inputs in M1 mediating this interaction remains unclear. The aim of this study was therefore to assess how CB influences neuroplasticity of early and late I-wave circuits. 22 young adults (22 ± 2.7 years) participated in 3 sessions in which I-wave periodicity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTMS) was applied over M1 during concurrent application of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over CB (tDCS CB ). In each session, iTMS either targeted early I-waves (1.5 ms interval; iTMS 1 . 5 ), late I-waves (4.5 ms interval; iTMS 4 . 5 ), or had no effect (variable interval; iTMS Sham ). Changes due to the intervention were examined with motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude using TMS protocols measuring corticospinal excitability (MEP 1mV ) and the strength of CB-M1 connections (CBI). In addition, we indexed I-wave activity using short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) and low-intensity single-pulse TMS applied with posterior-anterior (MEP PA ) and anterior-posterior (MEP AP ) current directions. Following both active iTMS sessions, there was no change in MEP 1mV , CBI or SICF (all P &gt; 0.05), suggesting that tDCS CB broadly disrupted the excitatory response that is normally seen following iTMS. However, although MEP AP also failed to facilitate after the intervention ( P &gt; 0.05), MEP PA potentiated following both active iTMS sessions (both P &lt; 0.05). This differential response between current directions could indicate a selective effect of CB on AP-sensitive circuits."

https://openalex.org/W4285078862,"To investigate self-reported cold sensitivity and functional disability after a repaired major nerve trunk injury in the upper extremity.We identified 735 individuals with a major nerve trunk injury in the upper extremity, surgically treated with direct nerve repair or reconstructed with nerve autografts, in the Swedish national quality registry for hand surgery (HAKIR). Patient-reported symptoms, including cold sensitivity, and perceived disability were collected using two questionnaires (HQ-8 and QuickDASH) preoperatively, and at three and 12 months postoperatively.We included 281 individuals, who had responded the questionnaires, where 197 (70%) were men (median age 34 [interquartile range 25-52] years) and 84 (30%) were women (median age 41 [25-55]). Cold sensitivity (scored 0-100) was the most prominent symptom 12 months postoperatively after an injured and repaired/reconstructed median (p<0.001) or ulnar (p<0.001) nerve, while individuals with a radial nerve injury showed milder symptoms. Concomitant injuries did not affect cold sensitivity scores. Individuals with ulnar nerve injuries scored higher in stiffness (p = 0.019), weakness (p<0.001) and ability to perform daily activities (p = 0.003) at 12 months postoperatively than median nerve injuries. Individuals with a median, ulnar or radial nerve injury with severe (>70) cold sensitivity had 25, 37 and 30 points higher QuickDASH scores, respectively (p<0.001), at 12 months postoperatively than individuals with mild (<30) cold sensitivity. There were no differences in QuickDASH score or cold sensitivity score at 12 months postoperatively between direct nerve repair or nerve reconstruction with nerve autografts. Neither age, nor sex, affected QuickDASH score at 12 months postoperatively.Cold sensitivity after surgery for a major nerve trunk injury in the upper extremity can be substantial with impaired ability to perform daily activities, where an ulnar nerve injury may have a worse outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4285078868,"Although the continental slope and abyss comprise the largest habitat on earth, the absence of documented fish sounds from deep waters is striking. Fishes with sexually dimorphic muscles attached to their swim bladders suggests that sounds are likely used in male courtship on the upper, mid and lower continental slope. To investigate the effects of environmental extremes on fish sound production, the acoustic behavior of a driven bubble is examined. This study is also relevant to target strength of sonar returns from fish and hearing in auditory specialist fishes. A bubble is a classic, if imperfect, model for swim bladder behavior since the swim-bladder wall is an anisotropic viscoelastic structure responsible for rapid damping. Acoustic properties of bubbles-including far-field resonant frequency, damping factor, and quality factor-are calculated in warm and cold surface conditions and in cold deep-water (depths 1000 m, 2000 m, and 3500 m) conditions using parameters for oxygen and nitrogen, the dominant gases in swim bladders. The far-field resonant frequency and damping factor of a bubble increase with depth, and the scattering cross-section and quality factor decrease with depth. These acoustic properties scale with undamped oscillation frequency of the bubble and do not vary significantly due to gas type or temperature. Bubbles in the deep-water environments are much less efficient radiators of sound than bubbles near the surface because the far-field radiated power for the same excitation decreases with depth. A bubble at depth 3500 m has a 25 dB loss in radiated sound power compared to the same-radius bubble at the surface. This reduction of radiation efficiency in deep water likely contributes to the absence of fish sound recordings in those environments."

This study examined the association between individuals' perception of the psychological burden related to the pandemic and addictive SMU.A cross-sectional study was conducted between February and May 2021 in two national contexts, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates. Data were gathered from a sample of 1322 participants drawn from a university population who completed measures of psychological burden related to COVID-19, anxious affect, and addictive SMU. Preliminary analyses of the potential association between the study variables were conducted using bivariate correlations followed by a pre-specified mediation model.At a correlational level, all three study variables were positively associated with each other (r values ranged from .18 to .50 and all p values were < .05). A further mediation analysis confirmed that the total effect of psychological burden on addictive SMU was significant (β = .654, SE = .033, 95% CI .589-.720), and this relationship remained significant with inclusion of the mediator. Significant mediation was evident across the total sample as well as within each country-specific subsample.These results provide insight into the factors that contribute to the development of addictive SMU in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings are discussed in relation to the emotion regulation function that SMU might play for individuals in the midst of emotional distress."
https://openalex.org/W4285079036,"COVID-19 has had a substantial national impact in South Korea, causing negative psychological responses including sleep-related problems. Literature indicates sleep problems among the general population have been reported to be as high as around 35.7% during the first 8 months of COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on sleep problems among the general population using relative search volume (RSV) data, and whether there are any differences by age and time periods spanning before and during the pandemic. RSV data was collected from the most commonly used search engine in South Korea, NAVER. Search terms were grouped into 4 categories: insomnia, other sleep disorders, sleeping pills, and sleeping pill side effects. Time points were divided into 4 periods, each 7 months long: 7 months before COVID-19 (T0), first confirmed COVID-19 case to 7 months after (T1), 7 to 14 months (T2), and 14 to 21 months (T3). A 2x4 factorial Analysis of Variance was conducted to investigate main effects and interactions between age and time periods. Main effects and interaction effects of age and time periods were significant for all search term groups. For all search terms, both age groups showed dramatic increase from T0 to T1. In age group 60 or above, RSV continued to increase for other sleep disorders and sleeping pill. Insomnia and sleeping pill side effects showed decreasing trend at T3. In general, sudden increase in RSV after occurrence of COVID-19 followed by slow decline were observed. However, for age group 60 or above, RSV values of other sleep disorders and sleeping pills continued to increase, suggesting slower recovery of psychological impact with increasing age. Overall, the results underscore the importance of implementing preventive measures for monitoring sleep problems during the pandemic, especially in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W4285079053,"Background In February 2021, the spread of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the Lombardy Region, Italy caused concerns about school-aged children as a source of contagion, leading local authorities to adopt an extraordinary school closure measure. This generated a debate about the usefulness of such an intervention in light of the trade-off between its related benefits and costs (e.g. delays in educational attainment, impact on children and families’ psycho-physical well-being). This article analyses the epidemiological impact of the school closure intervention in the Milan metropolitan area. Methods Data from the Agency for Health Protection of the Metropolitan City of Milan allowed analysing the trend of contagion in different age classes before and after the intervention, adopting an interrupted times series design, providing a quasi-experimental counterfactual scenario. Segmented Poisson regression models of daily incident cases were performed separately for the 3–11-year-old, the 12–19-year-old, and the 20+-year-old age groups, examining the change in the contagion curves after the intervention, adjusting for time-varying confounders. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression were used to assess the equality of survival curves in the three age groups before and after the intervention. Results Net of time-varying confounders, the intervention produced a daily reduction of the risk of contagion by 4% in those aged 3–11 and 12–19 (IRR = 0·96) and by 3% in those aged 20 or more (IRR = 0·97). More importantly, there were differences in the temporal order of contagion decrease between the age groups, with the epidemic curve lowering first in the school-aged children directly affected by the intervention, and only subsequently in the adult population, which presumably indirectly benefitted from the reduction of contagion among children. Conclusion Though it was not possible to completely discern the effect of school closures from concurrent policy measures, a substantial decrease in the contagion curves was clearly detected after the intervention. The extent to which the slowdown of infections counterbalanced the social costs of the policy remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W4285079069,"The contribution of Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) infection to intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and the antibiotic therapy has evoked several controversies in recent years. While some microbiology studies report bacterial disc infection within IDD patients, others attribute the positive results to contamination during prolonged cultures. In addition to the clinical controversy, little was known about the mechanism of C. acnes-caused Modic changes (MCs) if C. acnes was the pathogenic factor.This study aimed to investigate the inflammatory mechanism of MCs induced by different phylotypes of C. acnes in patients with IDD.Specimens from sixty patients undergoing microdiscectomy for disc herniation were included, C. acnes were identified by anaerobic culture, followed by biochemical and PCR-based methods. The identified species of C. acnes were respectively inoculated into the intervertebral discs of rabbits. MRI and histological change were observed. Additionally, we detected MMP expression in the rabbit model using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).Of the 60 cases, 18 (30%) specimens were positive for C. acnes, and we identified 4 of 6 defined phylogroups: IA, IB, II and III. The rabbits that received Type IB or II strains of C. acnes showed significantly decreased T1WI and higher T2WI at eighth weeks, while strain III C. acnes resulted in hypointense signals on both T1WI and T2WI. Histological examination results showed that all of the three types of C. acnes could cause disc degeneration and endplates rupture. Moreover, endplate degeneration induced by type IB or II strains of C. acnes is related with MMP13 expression. Meanwhile, strain III C. acnes might upregulated the level of MMP3.This study suggested that C. acnes is widespread in herniated disc tissues. Different types of C. acnes could induce different MCs by increasing MMP expression."

Enhanced air connectivity of an airport has been found to have a positive and significant impact on the competitiveness and attractiveness of the airport and the regional economy in which the airport is located. However, the drivers behind route development programs and their performance are not always clear; this has been less explored in the literature. In this paper, a dynamic performance management approach is taken to build a modeling framework in which key drivers affecting route development performance and strategic resources affecting key drivers are identified. Route-level planning is used in an empirical study to demonstrate the dynamic mechanism of airport route development initiatives and performance measurements. The proposed framework can not only provide performance monitoring, but also suggest suitable indicators to evaluate the performance for policymakers in future airport route development."
https://openalex.org/W4285079022,"Effective and adequate anesthesia is conducive to better restrain for pigs during surgical or diagnostic procedures This study aimed to evaluate cardiorespiratory and anesthetic effects of ketamine-midazolam-xylazine-sufentanil or tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine as general anesthetics in miniature pigs. In phase 1, one of the combinations was administered intramuscularly to miniature pigs. The KMXS protocol combined 10 mg kg-1 ketamine, 0.5 mg kg-1 midazolam, and 2 mg kg-1 xylazine with 2 μg kg-1 sufentanil. The TZX protocol combined 2.2 mg kg-1 tiletamine, 2.2 mg kg-1 zolazepam, and 1.4 mg kg-1 xylazine. After treatment, the mean arterial pressure, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral hemoglobin oxygen saturation, rectal temperature, and anesthesia quality were recorded. In phase 2, the feasibility of KMXS and TZX as general anesthetics were evaluated for pig castration. In phase 1, both drug combinations provided smooth induction with similar anesthetic effects. The KMXS protocol provided moderate anesthesia for 60-70 minutes in pigs, while the TZX protocol provided 30-45 minutes. In phase 2, castration was completed smoothly in all pigs with little fluctuation in physiological variables. The KMXS protocol is better for medium-term anesthesia, while the TZX protocol is preferable for short-term anesthesia in pigs."
https://openalex.org/W4285079118,"Severe bacterial infections are important causes of hospitalization and loss of health worldwide. In this study we aim to characterize the total burden, recurrence and severity of bacterial infections in the general population during a 22-year period.We investigated hospitalizations due to bacterial infection from eight different foci in the prospective population-based Trøndelag Health Study (the HUNT Study), where all inhabitants aged ≥ 20 in a Norwegian county were invited to participate. Enrollment was between 1995 and 1997, and between 2006 and 2008, and follow-up ended in February 2017. All hospitalizations, positive blood cultures, emigrations and deaths in the follow-up period were captured through registry linkage.A total of 79,393 (69.5% and 54.1% of the invited population) people were included, of which 42,237 (53%) were women and mean age was 48.5 years. There were 37,298 hospitalizations due to infection, affecting 15,496 (22% of all included) individuals. The median time of follow-up was 20 years (25th percentile 9.5-75th percentile 20.8). Pneumonia and urinary tract infections were the two dominating foci with incidence rates of 639 and 550 per 100,000 per year, respectively, and with increasing incidence with age. The proportion of recurring admissions ranged from 10.0% (central nervous system) to 30.0% (pneumonia), whilst the proportion with a positive blood culture ranged from 4.7% (skin- and soft tissue infection) to 40.9% (central nervous system). The 30-day mortality varied between 3.2% (skin- and soft tissue infection) and 20.8% (endocarditis).In this population-based cohort, we observed a great variation in the incidence, positive blood culture rate, recurrence and mortality between common infectious diseases. These results may help guide policy to reduce the infectious disease burden in the population."

However, little is known about the content of gender stereotypes about people of different ages (e.g., do gender stereotypes about 1-year-olds differ from those about older individuals?). In our pre-registered study, 4,598 adults rated either the typicality of characteristics (to assess descriptive stereotypes), or the desirability of characteristics (to assess prescriptive and proscriptive stereotypes) for targets who differed in gender and age. Between-subjects, we manipulated target gender (boy/man vs. girl/woman) and target age (1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, or 35). From this, we generated a normed list of descriptive, prescriptive, and proscriptive gender-stereotyped characteristics about people across the early developmental timespan. We make this archive, as well as our raw data, available to other researchers. We also present preliminary findings, demonstrating that some characteristics are consistently ungendered (e.g., challenges authority), others are gender-stereotypic across the early developmental timespan (e.g., males from age 1 to 35 tend to be dirty), and still others change over development (e.g., girls should be submissive, but only around age 10). Implications for gender stereotyping theory-as well as targets of gender stereotyping, across the lifespan-are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4285079341,"The objective of this study was to structure a proposal for an instrument to measure the mistreatment level of women during childbirth, through item response theory, based on the birth experience of postpartum women. A cross-sectional study was conducted, with the inclusion of 287 women who did not suffer complications during childbirth, randomly selected from two maternity hospitals in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul-Brazil, in 2016. Approximately 30 days after delivery, the women answered questions in a face-to-face interview about their birth experience (practices and interventions applied) and were inquired about their perception of having suffered disrespect, mistreatment or humiliation by health professionals. The set of practices was included in the item response theory model to design the instrument. Of the 36 items included in the model, 21 dealt with practices applied exclusively to women who went into labor, therefore two instruments were developed. The instrument including all women, containing 09 items, identified 23.7% prevalence of mistreatment to women during childbirth, while the instrument for women going into labor included 11 items and identified 22% prevalence. The items with the highest discrimination were: not having had a companion during labor (2.05; and 1.26), not feeling welcome (1.81; and 1.58), and not feeling safe (1.59; and 1.70), for all women and for those who went into labor, respectively. For those who went into labor, the items, did not have a companion during labor (1.22; PE 0.88) and did not feel comfortable asking questions and participating in decisions (1.20; PE 0.43) also showed greater discrimination. In contrast, when directly questioned, only 12.5% of women said they had experienced disrespect or mistreatment, suggesting that harmful practices are often not recognized as violent. Standardizing the measurement of mistreatment of women during childbirth can create more accurate estimates of its prevalence and contribute to the proposal of strategies to eliminate obstetric violence."
https://openalex.org/W4285079458,"We aimed to directly compare women’s pregnancy to postpartum outcomes and experiences across the major maternity models of care offered in Queensland, Australia. We conducted secondary analyses of self-reported data collected in 2012 from a state-wide sample of women who had recently given birth in Queensland (response rate = 30.4%). Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of outcomes and experiences associated with three models (GP Shared Care, Public Midwifery Continuity Care, Private Obstetric Care) compared with Standard Public Care, adjusting for relevant maternal characteristics and clinical covariates. Of 2,802 women, 18.2% received Standard Public Care, 21.7% received GP Shared Care, 12.9% received Public Midwifery Continuity Care, and 47.1% received Private Obstetric Care. There were minimal differences for women in GP Shared Care. Women in Public Midwifery Continuity Care were less likely to have a scheduled caesarean and more likely to have an unassisted vaginal birth, experience freedom of mobility during labour and informed consent processes for inducing labour, vaginal examinations, fetal monitoring and receiving Syntocinon to birth their placenta, and report highest quality interpersonal care. They had fewer vaginal examinations, lower odds of perineal trauma requiring sutures and anxiety after birth, shorter postpartum hospital stays, and higher odds of a home postpartum care visit. Women in Private Obstetric Care were more likely to have their labour induced, a scheduled caesarean birth, experience informed consent processes for caesarean, and report highest quality interpersonal care, but less likely to experience unassisted vaginal birth and informed consent for Syntocinon to birth their placenta. There is an urgent need to communicate variations between maternity models across the range of outcome and experiential measures that are important to women; build more rigorous comparative evidence for Private Midwifery Care; and prioritise experiential and out-of-pocket cost comparisons in further research to enable woman-centred informed decision-making."

https://openalex.org/W4285017848,"Shaping one owns actions by observing others’ actions is driven by the deep-rooted mechanism of perception-action coupling. It typically occurs automatically, expressed as for example the unintentional synchronization of reaction times in interactive games. Theories on perception-action coupling highlight its benefits such as the joint coordination of actions to cooperatively perform tasks properly, the learning of novel actions from others, and the bonding with likable others. However, such functional aspects and how they shape perception-action coupling have never been compared quantitatively. Here we tested a total of hundred-fifteen participants that played a stimulus-response task while, in parallel, they observed videos of agents that played the exact same task several milliseconds in advance. We compared to what degree the reaction times of actions of agents, who varied their behavior in terms of functionality and likability in preceding prisoner dilemma games and quizzes, shape the reaction times of human test participants. To manipulate functionality and likability, we varied the predictability of cooperative behavior and correctness of actions of agents, respectively, resulting in likable (cooperative), dislikable (uncooperative), functional (correct actions), and dysfunctional (incorrect actions) agents. The results of three experiments showed that the participants’ reaction times correlated most with the reaction times of agents that expressed functional behavior. However, the likability of agents had no effects on reaction time correlations. These findings suggest that, at least in the current computer task, participants are more likely to adopt the timing of actions from people that perform correct actions than from people that they like."
https://openalex.org/W4285078775,"In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the epidemiological transition is characterized by an increased burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the persistent challenge of infectious diseases. The transmission of tuberculosis, one of the leading infectious diseases, can be halted through active screening of risk groups and early case findings. Studies have reported comorbidities between tuberculosis (TB) and NCDs, which necessitates the development of an integrated disease management model. This scoping review discusses the possibilities and problems of integration in managing TB and NCDs, with a particular emphasis on diabetic mellitus (DM) and hypertension screening and control. We will conduct this review following Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping review. We will use key terms related to integrated management, i.e., screening, diagnosis, treatment, and care, of TB, DM, and hypertension in PubMed, Scopus Database, and ScienceDirect for research published from January 2005 to July 2021. This review will also consider grey literature, including unpublished literature and international disease management guidelines on TB, DM, and hypertension from WHO or other health professional organization. We will export the search results to citation manager software (EndNote). We will remove duplicates and apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify the set of papers for the review. After screening the titles and abstract, two authors will independently review the full text of selected studies and extract the data. We will synthesize all selected studies qualitatively and the results will be discussed with the experts. The results will be used as the basis of the development of a guideline for integrated TB, DM, and hypertension management."
https://openalex.org/W4285078799,"Background In 2012, the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation launched the Choosing Wisely campaign to reduce unnecessary care. However, it is unclear how much emergency physicians in Taiwan understand about Choosing Wisely. The purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitude, and behaviour of emergency physicians in Taiwan regarding Choosing Wisely and its related factors; the intention was to identify the baseline knowledge on the basis of which to promote Choosing Wisely in Taiwan. Methods This was a cross-sectional study including emergency physicians in Taiwan as research subjects who answered online questionnaires. A 42-item questionnaire was designed according to the Knowledge, Attitude, and Behaviour model (KAB). The questionnaire linkages were delivered to emergency physicians through social media (eg., Line, Facebook) and received assistance from different hospital directors. A total of 162 valid questionnaires were collected. Data analyses include t-test, analysis of variance, chi-square test, Pearson’s correlation, and multivariate linear regression model. Results The study determined that although only 38.9% of emergency physicians had heard of Choosing Wisely, the mean correct rate of knowledge score among emergency physicians was 70.1%. Attitude and the behaviour related to Choosing Wisely were positively associated, which means that the more positive the attitude towards Choosing Wisely is, the more positive the behaviour towards Choosing Wisely is. In multiple linear regression analyses, having served as a supervisor, belonging to divisions of health insurance service, and having heard of Choosing Wisely ( P &lt; 0.05) positively affect the knowledge of Choosing Wisely, but age presented a negative association. Conclusion This study found that physicians’ knowledge does not influence their attitudes and behaviours, which may be related to barriers of practicing Choosing Wisely activities. To effectively promote Choosing Wisely campaign, it is recommended to focus on the significant factors associated with emergency physicians’ perceptions regarding knowledge, attitude, and behavior of Choosing Wisely. Based on these factors, appropriate practice guidelines for Choosing Wisely can be formulated and promoted."
https://openalex.org/W4285078805,"Objective We used SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and electronic health record (EHR) data to investigate the associations between viral genomes and clinical characteristics and severe outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a case-control study of severe COVID-19 infection among patients hospitalized at a large academic referral hospital between March 2020 and May 2021. SARS-CoV-2 WGS was performed, and demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from the EHR. Severe COVID-19 (case patients) was defined as having one or more of the following: requirement for supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or death during hospital admission. Controls were hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who did not meet the criteria for severe infection. We constructed predictive models incorporating clinical and demographic variables as well as WGS data including lineage, clade, and SARS-CoV-2 SNP/GWAS data for severe COVID-19 using multiple logistic regression. Results Of 1,802 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, we performed WGS on samples collected from 590 patients, of whom 396 were case patients and 194 were controls. Age (p = 0.001), BMI (p = 0.032), test positive time period (p = 0.001), Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.001), history of chronic heart failure (p = 0.003), atrial fibrillation (p = 0.002), or diabetes (p = 0.007) were significantly associated with case-control status. SARS-CoV-2 WGS data did not appreciably change the results of the above risk factor analysis, though infection with clade 20A was associated with a higher risk of severe disease, after adjusting for confounder variables (p = 0.024, OR = 3.25; 95%CI: 1.31–8.06). Conclusions Among people hospitalized with COVID-19, older age, higher BMI, earlier test positive period, history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or diabetes, and infection with clade 20A SARS-CoV-2 strains can predict severe COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4285078885,"Hypoglycemia unawareness (HUA) in patients with FCPD is common with an unclear etiology. We evaluated the prevalence, characteristics of HUA, glycemic variability (GV), its possible association with pancreatic glucagon secretion & cardiac autonomic function in patients with FCPD.A two-week ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) and cardiac autonomic function test was done in patients with FCPD (n = 60), and categorized into UNAWARE (n = 44) and AWARE (n = 16) groups based on the Hypoglycemia Unawareness Index (HUI) score. Glycaemic variability was assessed from the AGP data using Easy GV 9.0.2 software. A subset of patients from both the groups (n = 11) underwent a mixed-meal challenge test and were compared with healthy individuals (controls; n = 11).HUA was evidenced in 73% (44/60) of patients with FCPD. Significant hypoglycemia, nocturnal hypoglycemia, duration of hypoglycemia and poor cardiac autonomic functions (p = 0.01) were prominent in the UNAWARE group. The overall GV was greater in the UNAWARE group. In the UNAWARE group, significantly reduced fasting and post prandial glucagon levels negatively correlated with HUI (r = -0.74, p < 0.05) and GV-hypoglycemia indices (p < 0.05) In contrast, significantly higher post prandial glucagon levels in the AWARE group positively correlated with post prandial hyperglycemia (r = 0.61, p < 0.05).Heterogeneity in patterns of glucagon secretion were significantly associated with HUA and GV. Reduced glucagon levels contribute to greater risks of HUA, nocturnal hypoglycemia and greater GV, while hyperglucagonemia predisposes to postprandial hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia awareness in patients with FCPD."

Methods This prospective study included forty-four eyes of 44 patients with treatment-naïve polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV, n = 12), hemorrhagic choroidal neovascularization (hCNV, n = 12), pigment epithelium detachment (PED, n = 9) and type 3 MNV (RAP, n = 11). All patients received three initial aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml injections (Eylea ® ) in monthly intervals (loading phase) and were subsequently treated until month 12. Measurements of arterial and venous oxygen saturation, vessel diameters and flicker response were performed using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA; IMEDOS, Jena, Germany). Statistical analysis was performed on the total population at baseline, after loading dose and at the last follow-up visit. Results The arterial oxygen saturation was 94.01±2.14% and showed no change after loading dose (93.94±2.88%, p = 0.4; estimated difference [confidence interval] -0.38 [-1.24; 0.48]) and at the last visit (95.48±1.90%; p = 0.1; -1.29 [-0.34; 2.91]). The venous oxygenation during treatment was 78.49±6.93% at baseline, 80.94±7.71% after 3-monthly injections (p = 0.7; -0.43 [-2.72; 1.86]) and 80.56±7.33% at month 12 (p = 0.5; 1.07 [-2.10; 4.24). The arterial and venous vessel diameters were 94±22μm and 131±19μm at baseline, and remained unchanged following aflibercept loading dose and at the last follow-up visit (p-value: p = 0.5; 2.30 [-5.00; 9.59] p = 0.8; 0.59 [-3.17; 4.34]). During stimulation with flicker light, arterial diameter changed by +1.24±4.93% at baseline and remained stable at month 3 (+2.70±5.95%; p = 0.5; 1.43 [-2.54; 5.41]) while the change in venous diameter during flicker stimulation was +4.52±4.45% at baseline and +4.13±3.65% after loading dose (p = 0.4, 5.18 [1.73; 8.63]). Conclusion During intravitreal aflibercept treatment oxygen saturation, vessel diameter and flicker response did not change in the total population of patients with specific subtypes of exudative maculopathy."
https://openalex.org/W4285078938,"The study was aimed to estimate the true prevalence of human tuberculosis (TB); identify risk factors and clinical symptoms of TB; and detect rifampicin (RIF) sensitivity in three study areas of Bangladesh.The cross-sectional study was conducted in three Bangladesh districts during 2018. Potential risk factors, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities were collected from 684 TB suspects. Sputum specimens were examined by LED microscopy. TB hierarchical true prevalence, risk factors and clinical symptoms were estimated and identified using a Bayesian analysis framework. Rifampicin sensitivity of M. tuberculosis (MTB) was detected by GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay.The median TB true prevalence was 14.2% (3.8; 34.5). Although overall clustering of prevalence was not found, several DOTS centers were identified with high prevalence (22.3% to 43.7%). Risk factors for TB identified (odds ratio) were age (> 25 to 45 years 2.67 (1.09; 6.99), > 45 to 60 years 3.43 (1.38; 9.19) and individuals in families/neighborhoods where a TB patient(s) has (ve) already been present (12.31 (6.79; 22.60)). Fatigue, night sweat, fever and hemoptysis were identified as important clinical symptoms. Seven of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF positive sputum specimens (65) were resistant to rifampicin.About one in every seven TB suspects was affected with TB. A number of the TB patients carry multi drug resistant MTB. Hierarchical true prevalence estimation allowed identifying DOTS centers with high TB burden. Insights from this study will enable more efficient use of DOTScenters-based TB surveillance to end the TB epidemic in Bangladesh by 2035."
https://openalex.org/W4285079079,"We investigated people with HIV (PWH) receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for latent syphilis infection prevalence, risk factors, treatment response, and neurosyphilis.A prospective follow-up study was conducted on PWH and latent syphilis. The cases were randomly assigned to receive either benzathine penicillin G (BPG) or doxycycline (DOXY), and the posttreatment response was evaluated after 12 and 24 months. The traditional algorithm was used for serodiagnosis, and a semi-quantitative rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test monitored disease activity and treatment effectiveness.Of the 823 participants, 64.8% were women, and the mean age was 41.7±10 years. Thirty-one (3.8%) of the participants (22 males and nine females) had latent syphilis. The risk factors were male sex (aOR = 3.14), increasing age (aOR = 1.04 per year), and cART duration (aOR = 1.01 per month). Baseline RPR titers were: ≤1:4 in 19 (61.3%), between 1:8 and 1:32 in 10 (32.2%), and >1:32 in 2 (6.4%). None of the seven cerebrospinal fluid analyses supported a neurosyphilis diagnosis. In the 12th month of treatment, 27 (87.1%) had adequate serological responses, three (9.7%) had serological nonresponse, and one (3.2%) had treatment failure. Syphilis treatment was repeated in the last four cases with the alternative drug. In terms of adequate serologic response, both therapies were comparable at the 12th month, p = 0.37. All cases responded to treatment in the 24th month.In PWH receiving cART, latent syphilis occurred more in men than women, suggesting an investigation of sexual practices and the impact of antenatal syphilis screening. Syphilis disease activity reduces in the latent stage. Therefore, the routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis contributes little to the diagnosis of asymptomatic neurosyphilis and the treatment success of latent syphilis. DOXY is an alternative to BPG, and cART improves serologic response to latent syphilis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4285079141,"Background Alcohol drinking during pregnancy has been well-known to cause the detrimental effects on fetal development; however, the adverse effects of pre-pregnancy drinking are largely unknown. We investigate whether alcohol drinking status before pregnancy is associated with the risk for macrosomia, an offspring’s adverse outcome, in a Korean pregnancy registry cohort (n = 4,542) enrolled between 2013 and 2017. Methods Binge drinking was defined as consuming ≥5 drinks on one occasion and ≥2 times a week, and a total 2,886 pregnant, included in the final statistical analysis, were divided into 3 groups: never, non-binge, and binge drinking. Results The prevalence of macrosomia was higher in binge drinking before pregnancy than those with never or non-binge drinking (7.5% vs. 3.2% or 2.9%, p = 0.002). Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated an independent association between macrosomia and prepregnancy binge drinking after adjusting for other confounders (adjusted odds ratio = 2.29; 95% CI, 1.08–4.86; p = 0.031). The model added binge drinking before pregnancy led to improvement of 10.6% (95% CI, 2.03–19.07; p = 0.0006) in discrimination from traditional risk prediction models. Conclusion Together, binge drinking before pregnancy might be an independent risk factor for developing macrosomia. Intensified intervention for drinking alcohol in women who are planning a pregnancy is important and may help prevent macrosomia."
https://openalex.org/W4285079173,"In this paper, a dynamic update algorithm of double scrambling-DNA row and column closed loop based on chaotic system is proposed. The classical scrambling and diffusion structure are used in the whole process. In the scrambling stage, a new pixel reconstruction method is proposed by combining the Hilbert curve with Knuth-Durstenfeld shuffle algorithm to overcome the shortcoming of nearby storage of Hilbert curve. This method reconstructs the pixel matrix of one-dimensional vector according to the Hilbert curve coding method, and achieves good scrambling effect, while reducing its time complexity and space complexity. In the diffusion stage, combining the plaintext row, the ciphertext row and the key row, and taking advantage of the parallel computing power and high storage density of the DNA encoding, the existing block diffusion operation is improved, and the two-round diffusion of the DNA encoding is proposed. When the last line of ciphertext is generated, the first line of ciphertext is updated and the closed-loop dynamic update of the encryption system is realized. Finally, SHA-256 is used to give the secret key and calculate the initial value of the chaotic system. The simulation results show that the “double scrambling-DNA row and column closed loop dynamic” update algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively improve the efficiency of information transmission and have high security."
https://openalex.org/W4285079242,"Electrical waves that rotate in the heart organize dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Finding the region around which such rotation occurs is one of the most important practical questions for arrhythmia management. For many years, the main method for finding such regions was so-called phase mapping, in which a continuous phase was assigned to points in the heart based on their excitation status and defining the rotation region as a point of phase singularity. Recent analysis, however, showed that in many rotation regimes there exist phase discontinuities and the region of rotation must be defined not as a point of phase singularity, but as a phase defect line. In this paper, we use this novel methodology and perform a comparative study of three different phase definitions applied to in silico data and to experimental data obtained from optical voltage mapping experiments on monolayers of human atrial myocytes. We introduce new phase defect detection algorithms and compare them with those that appeared in literature already. We find that the phase definition is more important than the algorithm to identify sudden spatial phase variations. Sharp phase defect lines can be obtained from a phase derived from local activation times observed during one cycle of arrhythmia. Alternatively, similar quality can be obtained from a reparameterization of the classical phase obtained from observation of a single timeframe of transmembrane potential. We found that the phase defect line length was (35.9 ± 6.2)mm in the Fenton-Karma model and (4.01 ± 0.55)mm in cardiac human atrial myocyte monolayers. As local activation times are obtained during standard clinical cardiac mapping, the methods are also suitable to be applied to clinical datasets. All studied methods are publicly available and can be downloaded from an institutional web-server."

First of all, a game model under the influences of emotion is constructed by using Range Dependent Expected Utility(RDEU) theory and emotional function. Secondly, the Jacobian matrix is utilized to analyze the stability of the equilibrium point for the model constructed above. Next, numerical simulation is used to analyze the evolution trend of discrete emotions. The evolutionary results show that when one party holds an optimistic mood, equilibrium evolves to a relatively optimal state; while when one party holds a pessimistic mood, the more pessimistic the party is, the more likely it is to cause NIMBY conflicts. Compared with the people's sentiments, the government's moods have a greater impact on the evolutionary consequences. Finally, depending on the conclusions of the evolutionary analysis, some suggestions on the governance of NIMBY conflicts are put forward."

Indicators of pregnancy-related complications were examined individually, including preterm birth, low birth weight, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, oligohydramnios and intrahepatic cholestasis. We evaluated disease odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), after controlling for potential confounders including body mass index (BMI), maternal age and gestational week at NIPT. A total of 3534 women were included in our analyses. Women with fetal fraction<15.15% had increased risk of gestational hypertension (OR 4.41, CI [1.65, 12.45]) and oligohydramnios (OR 2.26, CI [1.33, 3.80]) compared to women with fetal fraction≥15.15%. No significant associations with fetal fraction were found for preterm birth, low birth weight, gestational diabetes, and intrahepatic cholestasis. In Summary, fetal fraction is inversely associated with the risk of gestational hypertension and oligohydramnios."
