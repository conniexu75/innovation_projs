The recessive gene was selected from the World Barley Collection. Other amino acids are also influenced by the gene. Protein content segregates independently of the changed amino acid pattern. The gene putatively influences the matrix proteins, which characteristically adhere to the starch grains in meal preparations. The morphological character permits rapid microscopic screening of single seeds without affecting viability. Low yield is considerably improved by crossing and selection."

https://openalex.org/W1579443142,"Abstract A cell-free protein-synthesizing system derived from rabbit reticulocytes is described which is dependent on the addition of transfer RNA for the translation of endogenous hemoglobin messenger RNA. Product analysis indicates that the system is active in the initiation of new chains. When hemoglobin is synthesized in the presence of a limiting amount of tRNA, there is a 50% decrease in α chain production relative to β chain production. Deacylated rabbit liver tRNA can, but deacylated Escherichia coli tRNA cannot, be substituted for rabbit reticulocyte tRNA in the synthesis of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1667751859,"Abstract Crystalline l-tyrosine phenol lyase (deaminating) was prepared from the cell extract of Escherichia intermedia A-21 grown in a medium supplemented with l-tyrosine. The purification procedure included ammonium sulfate fractionation, protamine sulfate treatment, DEAE-Sephadex and hydroxylapatite column chromatographies, and Sephadex G-150 gel filtration. Crystals were obtained from solutions of the purified enzyme by the addition of ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was homogeneous by the criteria of ultracentrifugation and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight was determined to be approximately 170,000. The crystalline enzyme catalyzed the stoichiometric conversion of l-tyrosine into phenol, pyruvate, and ammonia, in the presence of added pyridoxal phosphate. The enzyme also catalyzed pyruvate formation from d-tyrosine, S-methyl-l-cysteine, l-cysteine, l-serine and d-serine, but at rather lower rates than from l-tyrosine. l-Alanine, phenol, and pyrocatechol inhibited pyruvate formation from these substrates."

This preparation, which was homogeneous by sedimentation equilibrium experiments and by analytical disc gel electrophoresis, had a molecular weight of approximately 113,000 and a subunit molecular weight of 15,000. The enzymatic activity is abolished by carbonyl reagents. Based on the spectrum of the enzyme following reaction with phenylhydrazine, and on the recovery of 3H-lactate from hydrolysates of borotritide-reduced enzyme, covalently bound pyruvate has been identified as the carbonyl moiety involved in the enzymatic activity. There are 1 to 2 moles of pyruvate present per mole of enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2074969866,"Allogeneic antiserums against human lymphocytes were specifically inhibited by M protein from beta hemolytic group A Streptococcus pyogenes, type 1. Analogous M proteins from streptococcus types 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, and 14 had little or no inhibitory activity. The specific inhibition by M protein is not a result of anticomplementary activity or of coating of the lymphocyte surface. Streptococcal polysaccharide and 73 other polysaccharides were inactive. Because all seven HL-A specificities tested were inhibited, it is inferred that M1 protein has a structure common to human histocompatibility antigens."

https://openalex.org/W1556377998,"Abstract Erythro-β-hydroxy-l-aspartate is a good substrate for the catalytic subunit of the aspartate transcarbamylase of Escherichia coli, with Km = 24 mm (approximately the same as the Km for l-aspartate) and Vmax = 0.18 mole per min per g (22% of the Vmax for l-aspartate) at pH 8 and 28°. Aminomalonate is also carbamylated by the enzyme (Km approximately 770 mm and Vmax = 0.014 mole per min per g under the same conditions), but threo-β-hydroxy-dl-aspartate, erythro, threo-β-methyl-dl-aspartate, α-methyl-dl-aspartate, l-glutamate, and O-phospho-dl-serine are all inactive, even at high concentrations of enzyme. dl-α-Methylsuccinate, d- and l-tartrate, d-aspartate, the α- and β-methylaspartates, and threo-β-hydroxy-dl-aspartate are all poor inhibitors (Ki greater than 100 mm), whereas mesotartrate (Ki = 2.7 mm at pH 7 and 28°) and d- and l-malate are good competitive inhibitors for l-aspartate. Since maleate is a much better inhibitor than fumarate, we concluded previously that l-aspartate is bound to the aspartate transcarbamylase-carbamyl phosphate complex with its carboxylates oriented approximately cis to one another. Using erythro-β-hydroxy-l-aspartate as an example, four loci can be designated on the enzyme-carbamyl phosphate complex, corresponding to the positions of the α-amino group (A), the β-hydroxyl group (B), the β-hydrogen (C), and the α-hydrogen (D). When the carboxylates are cis, A is cis to B and C is cis to D. A single set of restrictions on these four loci can be used to rationalize the specificity of the enzyme for analogues of l-aspartate as substrates or inhibitors and the previous observation that l-aspartate binds very poorly to the enzyme-carbamyl phosphate complex. The restrictions are (a) that Loci A and B can accept hydroxyl groups without substantial impairment of binding but Loci C and D cannot, and (b) that an amino or methyl group in any of the four loci undergoes an interaction with the enzyme-carbamyl phosphate complex that prevents tight binding. These restrictions lead to the conclusions that mesotartrate binds with the hydroxyl groups in Loci A and B but not in C and D, that l-malate binds with the hydroxyl group in Locus A, and that d-malate binds with the hydroxyl group in Locus B."

Two classes of mutant cells are unaffected by colicin. Vesicles from colicin-resistant strains are sensitive to colicin E1, whereas vesicles from colicin-tolerant strains are unaffected by colicin El. These results suggest that the colicin E1 receptor is on the cell membrane and that colicin-tolerant strains have altered membranes while colicin-resistant strains have altered cell walls."
https://openalex.org/W1651811690,"Abstract Crystalline l-tyrosine phenol lyase of Escherichia intermedia A-21 is inactive in the absence of added pyridoxal phosphate. Half-maximal enzymatic activity is obtained at a concentration of 1.3 x 10-6 m pyridoxal phosphate. Binding of pyridoxal phosphate to the apoenzyme is accompanied by pronounced increase in absorbance at 340 and 430 mµ. Holotyrosine phenol lyase requires K+ or NH4+ for its maximal activity, but Na+ is inactive. When K+ is replaced by Na+, a small decrease in absorbance at 430 mµ is observed. The amount of pyridoxal phosphate bound to the apoenzyme was determined by equilibrium dialysis and spectrophotometric titration to be 2 moles per mole of enzyme. Reduction of holoenzyme with sodium borohydride results in a shift of the absorption peak at 430 mµ to 336 mµ. e-Pyridoxyllysine was isolated from the acid hydrolysate of the reduced holoenzyme by paper chromatography and electrophoresis. Addition of the substrate, l-tyrosine, or the competitive inhibitor, l-alanine, to the holoenzyme causes appearance of a new absorption peak near 500 mµ which disappears as the substrate is decomposed but remains unchanged in the presence of the inhibitor."

The islets of Langerhans were isolated with collagenase, and then incubated with buffer, glucose, tolbutamide, or glucagon added to the medium. The insulin released into the medium was measured by immunoassay. Glucagon produced the only significant increase above base line; glucose and tolbutamide failed to enhance secretion of insulin. The data suggest that isolated human fetal islets of this gestational age develop responsiveness to glucagon earlier than to glucose or tolbutamide."
https://openalex.org/W1487811674,"Abstract A transient nuclear magnetic resonance method has been used to measure the rate at which succinate, a competitive inhibitor of l-aspartate, binds to the aspartate transcarbamylase of Escherichia coli and to its catalytic subunit. In the presence of catalytic subunit and carbamyl phosphate, the relaxation time T2 for succinate is greatly shortened, while the relaxation time T1 is not affected much. In an analogous experiment with inorganic phosphate in place of carbamyl phosphate, T2 is also greatly shortened and, in both instances, the relaxation times are independent of the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency. The expressions for relaxation in the presence of chemical exchange were examined for limiting cases of frequency independence. Two limiting cases could be distinguished by the opposite dependences of T2 on temperature, and it was demonstrated clearly that succinate exchanges slowly with the enzyme-carbamyl phosphate complex, but rapidly with the enzyme phosphate complex. For exchange of succinate with the catalytic subunit-carbamyl phosphate complex, a bimolecular rate constant of 2.3 x 105 m-1 sec-1 at 33° for binding of succinate and an activation energy of 12 kcal per mole for dissociation of succinate from the complex were found. The exchange of succinate with the catalytic subunit-phosphate complex was too rapid to permit measurement of the rate constant by nuclear magnetic resonance methods, but a rotational correlation time of 0.73 x 10-8 sec at 33° was determined for the ternary complex. The results indicate that succinate has relatively free access to the active site of the subunit-phosphate complex and is bound rigidly. The unusually slow bimolecular rate constant for binding of succinate to the subunit-carbamyl phosphate complex may indicate that a conformational change is concerted with binding. A fast bimolecular step, followed by a slow step, cannot be ruled out entirely, but the concentration of the intermediate complex is probably low (less than 2%). For the native enzyme, the rate constant for binding of the last molecule of succinate to the complex with carbamyl phosphate is 1.9 x 105 m-1 sec-1 at 33°, with an activation energy of 8 kcal per mole for dissociation of succinate from the complex. The rotational correlation time for the native enzyme-phosphate-succinate complex is 2.2 x 10-8 sec at 33°. These results, very similar to those obtained with the catalytic subunit, indicate that the regulatory subunits have little influence on the properties of the active sites when the native enzyme is saturated with succinate."
https://openalex.org/W1543692967,"Abstract A leucyl, phenylalanyl transfer RNA-protein transferase has been purified nearly 300-fold from the 105,000 x g supernatant fraction of Escherichia coli. The procedure consists of extraction of the precipitate formed with protamine sulfate, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and Sephadex G-75, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The enzyme preparation specifically catalyzes the transfer of leucine and phenylalanine from tRNA to acceptor proteins. The transfer reaction requires the presence of monovalent cation, and maximal rates are obtained with 0.15 m KCl. The reaction is inhibited by divalent cations and by puromycin, but not by chloramphenicol. The transfer of both amino acids appears to be catalyzed by a single enzyme since the two activities are present in a constant ratio over the entire range of purification and show identical kinetics of thermal inactivation. When bovine serum albumin is employed as the acceptor protein, both amino acids are attached to it in a way that retains the free α-amino group."

Such activities are reminiscent of those of classical endotoxin. Treatment of mice with either substance is capable of inducing tolerance to subsequent challenge with lethal doses of endotoxin or poly I·poly C5.

https://openalex.org/W1581209973,The amino acid sequence of the human κ Bence-Jones protein Ag containing 214 residues has been determined by a combination of four procedures: sequence analysis of the tryptic and of the chymotryptic peptides of the carboxymethylated protein described earlier and partial sequence analysis of the tryptic peptides of the aminoethylated protein and of the peptic peptides of the oxidized protein described herein. The tryptic peptides from the aminoethylated protein account for the total amino acid content and provide some necessary overlaps. Analysis of two of these peptides and of one of the peptic cysteic acid peptides has yielded the previously missing sequence for positions 19 through 32. There are two analogous disulfide bridges: one connecting Cys-23 and Cys-88 and one connecting Cys-134 and Cys-194. Comparison to the provisional sequences of other human κ Bence-Jones proteins has verified the concept that the NH2-terminal half of κ light chains is prone to variation in sequence whereas the COOH-terminal half has a fixed sequence except for one hereditary variation. Many of the differences in sequence in the NH2-terminal portion of κ-chains are not attributable to single point mutations. The various genetic mechanisms proposed to explain the variability in sequence of immunoglobulin light chains are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1640460526,"Abstract Purified yeast phenylalanyl transfer RNA synthetase can aminoacylate three Escherichia coli transfer RNAs. One of these tRNAs is E. coli valine transfer RNA which has been extensively purified and shown capable of being aminoacylated with phenylalanine and purified yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. The extent of this heterologous aminoacylation is approximately 90%. A comparison of the structures of the three tRNAs (E. coli valine tRNA, yeast phenylalanine tRNA, and wheat phenylalanine tRNA) which are acceptable substrates for yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase shows that the dihydrouridine loop and stem of all three molecules are exceedingly similar. This region must therefore be involved in the recognition of a tRNA by this synthetase."

https://openalex.org/W1572095982,"Abstract 1,4-Diaminobutane and spermidine are the predominant polyamines in Escherichia coli that are growing in log phase on minimal medium. Contrary to earlier reports, significant acetylation does not occur when E. coli is grown under these conditions. The intracellular amines are completely retained by the cell during logarithmic growth. There is no evidence of oxidative degradation or of significant loss to the medium. Significant acetylation of the amines has been found in two situations: (a) storage of a culture in the cold is associated with a continuous increase in the monoacetylspermidine at the expense of intracellular free spermidine; and (b) growth in a medium containing high concentrations of spermidine results in the conversion of a significant percentage of the cellular spermidine to monoacetylspermidine. Storage of a culture in the cold also leads to a progressive loss of 1,4-diaminobutane to the medium, resulting in a marked decrease in its cellular concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1563511316,"Abstract Aminoacylation of valine transfer RNA from Escherichia coli by phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase from Neurospora crassa is extremely sensitive to assay conditions. In Tris buffer under optimal conditions, the final yield of phenylalanyl-tRNAval is a function of enzyme concentration, and aminoacylation is incomplete even at very high enzyme concentrations. At low enzyme concentrations, the final yield of phenylalanyl-tRNAval is increased 10-fold by 20% dimethyl sulfoxide. Ethanol (10%) also increases the extent of aminoacylation, whereas NaCl, NH4Cl, and 2-mercaptoethanol all lead to decreased final yields. When cacodylate buffer is used in place of Tris buffer, the pH optimum for aminoacylation is shifted from above 8.1 to 6.3, and various kinetic properties of the aminoacylation reaction are changed. At low enzyme concentrations over 10 times more phenylalanyl-tRNAval is formed in cacodylate buffer than is formed in Tris buffer. Dimethyl sulfoxide (20%) and all concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol, ethanol, NaCl, and NH4Cl inhibit aminoacylation in cacodylate buffer. These results emphasize that buffers are not necessarily inert compounds merely maintaining the pH of a reaction mixture and that the first step in the study of a heterologous aminoacylation reaction should be the careful optimization of reaction conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1558956043,"Abstract A method was devised for rapid separation of Escherichia coli cells from relatively thick suspensions by centrifugation through silicone. This permits estimation of the rate of equilibration of external thiomethylgalactoside via influx along its concentration gradient into cells treated with metabolic inhibitors. The influx of galactoside is thereby shown to be markedly dependent upon energy coupling. Kinetic studies of influx into energy-uncoupled cells show a markedly decreased maximal velocity and an increased apparent Michaelis-Menten dissociation constant. Counter-flow experiments indicate that galactoside carriers are functional in inhibited cells despite the reduction in initial rate of entry. Inhibited cells show much greater counterflow in the influx direction at low temperatures than do uninhibited cells. Energy-uncoupled entry increases logarithmically with temperature, and the Q10 is relatively high as compared to energy-coupled entry. The results can all be interpreted in terms of a single mechanism for energy coupling, based on the dual influx model described previously."
https://openalex.org/W1579264798,The tryptic peptides from human pepsin and gastricsin were purified and their sequences were determined. The sequence of 27 residues at the COOH-terminal end of human pepsin was found to be: -Ile-Leu-Gly-Asp-Val-Phe-Ile-Arg-Gln-Phe-Tyr-Thr-Val-Phe-Asp-Arg-Ala-Asn-Asn-Gln-Val-Gly-Leu-Ala-Pro-Val-Ala. The sequence of 19 residues at the COOH-terminal end of human gastricsin was found to be: -Gln-Phe-Tyr-Thr-Val-Phe-Asp-Arg-Ala-Asn-Asn-Lys-Glu-Gly-Leu-Ala-Pro-Val-Ala. These sequences are extensively homologous to each other and to the known COOH-terminal sequence of bovine rennin.

https://openalex.org/W2055564309,"THE survival time of skin allografts in mice incompatible at non H-2 histocompatibility loci is frequently shorter in females than in males1–3. As far as we know, comparable differences have not been observed for allografts of normal tissue incompatible at the H-2 locus, although the enhanced suppression of tumour growth by female hosts has been reported for both H-24 and non H-22,5 histoincompatibilities. In the normal animal, the mean survival time for grafts on male and female mice varies by less than a day in the combination CBA→strong A. This is true for our own strains, whose origin has been described6, and this does not seem to have been contra dieted.

https://openalex.org/W1652455455,"Abstract T4 DNA was used to stimulate RNA and protein synthesis in a cell-free extract prepared from uninfected Escherichia coli. Previously, this system was shown to synthesize active β-glucosyl transferase, an early T4 enzyme, and lysozyme, an enzyme which appears late during T4 infection. The detailed kinetics of specific enzyme synthesis in vitro has been studied further. Under conditions which were optimal for early enzyme synthesis, the appearance of β-glucosyl transferase preceded lysozyme synthesis by 4 to 5 min. The kinetics of partial reactions leading to enzyme synthesis in vitro was also investigated. Lysozyme-specific messenger RNA was synthesized after β-glucosyl transferase-specific messenger RNA, although transcription of the two genes was initiated simultaneously. The long delay in DNA-dependent lysozyme synthesis was overcome by elevated magnesium ion concentrations. This kinetics indicated that a barrier against lysozyme synthesis in vitro operated between initiation of RNA synthesis and RNA elongation. This phenomenon may relate to either delayed polar transcription of regions of T4 DNA distal to RNA polymerase binding sites or to the preferential elongation of some messages by E. coli RNA polymerase after binding to T4 DNA has occurred."

https://openalex.org/W1536899068,"Abstract It has long been known that infection of Escherichia coli with bacteriophage T2 causes degradation of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid and that 70 to 80% of the degradation products appear in viral DNA within 30 min after infection. It is reasonable to assume that exonucleases participate in this process and catalyze the production of mononucleotide intermediates. To study this system in more detail, the amounts of free mononucleotides present in the cells were measured at various times after infection with phage T2. The extent of transferal of labeled nucleotides from bacterial nucleic acids to the free mononucleotide pools was also studied. Only a gradual and small increase in the total amounts of deoxyribonucleotides in the pools was observed after infection, in spite of drastic changes both in the rate of nucleic acid synthesis and in the pathways of nucleic acid metabolism that occur at this time. This suggests that the intracellular concentrations of these intermediates are precisely controlled. By labeling the bacterial nucleic acid with 32P-orthophosphate and subsequently infecting the cells with T2 phage, the amount of nucleic acid-derived nucleotides present in the deoxyribonucleotide pools was found to increase rapidly 4 min after infection and decline precipitously 10 to 15 min after infection. At 7 to 8 min after infection, 50 to 75% of the nucleotides entering these pools came from the bacterial nucleic acids. Of the known bacterial and phage-induced exonucleases, only T2 exonuclease A exhibits sufficient activity in vitro to readily account for the rate of nucleotide production that is observed. The time of appearance of this enzymatic activity is correlated with the time of increase of nucleic acid-derived nucleotides in the pools. It is paradoxical that, 10 to 15 min after infection, a rapid decline of labeling of the pools occurs at a time when half of the bacterial DNA remains. Knowledge of the relative specific activities of the deoxycytidylate and thymidylate pools makes it possible to estimate the rate of their interconversion in vivo by the pathway involving the phage-induced enzymes deoxycytidylate deaminase and thymidylate synthetase. The data indicate that, at 9 min after infection, approximately 15% of the deoxycytidylate derived from bacterial DNA is converted to thymidylate via this pathway. The high specific activity of the deoxyadenylate pool suggests that some of this compound may have been derived from a deoxyguanosine nucleotide. A small but reproducibly measurable amount of nucleic acid-derived phosphate was found in the nucleotide pools of uninfected cells. This suggests that a slow turnover of stable ribonucleic acid, or perhaps both RNA and DNA, occurs in rapidly growing E. coli."
