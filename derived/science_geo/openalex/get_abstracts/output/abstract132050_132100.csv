https://openalex.org/W1983806918,"The cloning of the genes encoding cancer antigens has opened new possibilities for the treatment of patients with cancer. In this study, immunodominant peptides from the gp100 melanoma-associated antigen were identified, and a synthetic peptide, designed to increase binding to HLA-A2 molecules, was used as a cancer vaccine to treat patients with metastatic melanoma. On the basis of immunologic assays, 91% of patients could be successfully immunized with this synthetic peptide, and 13 of 31 patients (42%) receiving the peptide vaccine plus IL-2 had objective cancer responses, and four additional patients had mixed or minor responses. Synthetic peptide vaccines based on the genes encoding cancer antigens hold promise for the development of novel cancer immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2067746562,"Detailed studies of elementary chemical processes on well-characterized single crystal surfaces have contributed substantially to the understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. Insight into the structure of surface alloys combined with an understanding of the relation between the surface composition and reactivity is shown to lead directly to new ideas for catalyst design. The feasibility of such an approach is illustrated by the synthesis, characterization, and tests of a high–surface area gold-nickel catalyst for steam reforming."

These diverse aggregate morphologies were seen at each composition, but their size scale decreased with a decreasing fraction of the rigid-rod block. Compared to coil-coil block copolymer micelles, the present aggregates are larger by about two orders of magnitude and have aggregation numbers of over 10 8 . The spherical and cylindrical aggregates have large hollow cavities. Only spherical aggregates with aggregation numbers in excess of 10 9 were formed in the presence of fullerenes (C 60 , C 70 ) in solution, resulting in the solubilization and encapsulation of over 10 10 fullerene molecules per aggregate."
https://openalex.org/W2012155675,"The in vivo biological function of a steroid receptor coactivator was assessed in mice in which the SRC-1 gene was inactivated by gene targeting. Although in both sexes the homozygous mutants were viable and fertile, target organs such as uterus, prostate, testis, and mammary gland exhibited decreased growth and development in response to steroid hormones. Expression of RNA encoding TIF2, a member of the SRC-1 family, was increased in the SRC-1 null mutant, perhaps compensating partially for the loss of SRC-1 function in target tissues. The results indicate that SRC-1 mediates steroid hormone responses in vivo and that loss of its coactivator function results in partial resistance to hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2010795697,"The feasibility of a malaria vaccine is supported by the fact that children in endemic areas develop naturally acquired immunity to disease. Development of disease immunity is characterized by a decrease in the frequency and severity of disease episodes over several years despite almost continuous infection1, suggesting that immunity may develop through the acquisition of a repertoire of specific, protective antibodies directed against polymorphic target antigens1–3. Plasmodium falciparum erythro-cyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMPI) is a potentially important family of target antigens, because these proteins are inserted into the red cell surface and are prominently exposed4–6 and because they are highly polymorphic and undergo clonal antigenic variation7,8,18, a mechanism of immune evasion maintained by a large family of var genes9–11. In a large prospective study of Kenyan children, we have used the fact that anti-PfEMP1 antibodies agglutinate infected erythrocytes in a variant-specific manner10,12–16, to show that the PfEMPI variants expressed during episodes of clinical malaria were less likely to be recognized by the corresponding child's own preexisting antibody response than by that of children of the same age from the same community. In contrast, a heterologous parasite isolate was just as likely to be recognized. The apparent selective pressure exerted by established anti-PfEMPl antibodies on infecting parasites supports the idea that such responses provide variant-specific protection against disease."

https://openalex.org/W2026644829,"The DPC4(SMAD4) gene plays a key role in the TGFβ signaling pathway. We inactivated its mouse homolog Dpc4(Smad4). The homozygous mutants were embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygotes showed no abnormality. We then introduced the Dpc4 mutation into the ApcΔ716knockout mice, a model for human familial adenomatous polyposis. Because both Apc and Dpc4 are located on chromosome 18, we constructed compound heterozygotes carrying both mutations on the same chromosome by meiotic recombination. In such mice, intestinal polyps developed into more malignant tumors than those in the simple ApcΔ716heterozygotes, showing an extensive stromal cell proliferation, submucosal invasion, cell type heterogeneity, and in vivo transplantability. These results indicate that mutations in DPC4(SMAD4) play a significant role in the malignant progression of colorectal tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2038050262,"Experiments show how product pathways can be controlled by irradiation with one or more laser beams during individual bimolecular collisions or during unimolecular decompositions. For bimolecular collisions, control has been achieved by selective excitation of reagent vibrational modes, by control of reagent approach geometry, and by control of orbital alignment. For unimolecular reactions, control has been achieved by quantum interference between different reaction pathways connecting the same initial and final states and by adjusting the temporal shape and spectral content of ultrashort, chirped pulses of radiation. These collision-control experiments deeply enrich the understanding of how chemical reactions occur."

https://openalex.org/W2012499551,Tunneling electrons from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope were used to induce and monitor the reversible rotation of single molecules of molecular oxygen among three equivalent orientations on the platinum(111) surface. Detailed studies of the rotation rates indicate a crossover from a single-electron process to a multielectron process below a threshold tunneling voltage. Values for the energy barrier to rotation and the vibrational relaxation rate of the molecule were obtained by comparing the experimental data with a theoretical model. The ability to induce the controlled motion of single molecules enhances our understanding of basic chemical processes on surfaces and may lead to useful single-molecule devices.

https://openalex.org/W2161184056,"We have identified a DNA site involved in chromosome partitioning in B. subtilis. This site was identified in vivo as the binding site for the chromosome partitioning protein Spo0J, a member of the ParB family of partitioning proteins. Spo0J is a site-specific DNA-binding protein that recognizes a 16 bp sequence found in spo0J. Allowing two mismatches, this sequence occurs ten times in the entire B. subtilis chromosome, all in the origin-proximal approximately 20%. Eight of the ten sequences are bound to Spo0J in vivo. The presence of a site on an otherwise unstable plasmid stabilized the plasmid in a Spo0J-dependent manner, demonstrating that this site, called parS, can function as a partitioning site. This site and Spo0J are conserved in a wide range of bacterial species."

This specimen, although exhibiting avian features such as a reversed hallux and ulnar papillae, retains characteristics that indicate a theropod ancestry, including a pubic foot and hyposphene-hypantra vertebral articulations. Rahona has a robust, hyperextendible second digit on the hind foot that terminates in a sicklelike claw, a unique characteristic of the theropod groups Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. A phylogenetic analysis places Rahona with Archaeopteryx , making Rahona one of the most primitive birds yet discovered."

https://openalex.org/W2042708317,"A cell-free system that mimics the reassembly of Golgi stacks at the end of mitosis requires two ATPases, NSF and p97, to rebuild Golgi cisternae. Morphological studies now show that α-SNAP, a component of the NSF pathway, can inhibit the p97 pathway, whereas p47, a component of the p97 pathway, can inhibit the NSF pathway. Anti-syntaxin 5 antibodies and a soluble, recombinant syntaxin 5 inhibited both pathways, suggesting that this t-SNARE is a common component. Biochemical studies confirmed this, showing that p47 binds directly to syntaxin 5 and competes for binding with α-SNAP. p47 also mediates the binding of p97 to syntaxin 5 and so plays an analogous role to α-SNAP, which mediates the binding of NSF."
https://openalex.org/W2146597600,"Mutations in the C. elegans vab-1 gene disrupt the coordinated movements of cells during two periods of embryogenesis. vab-1 mutants are defective in the movement of neuroblasts during closure of the ventral gastrulation cleft and in the movements of epidermal cells during ventral enclosure of the embryo by the epidermis. We show that vab-1 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase of the Eph family. Disruption of the kinase domain of VAB-1 causes weak mutant phenotypes, indicating that VAB-1 may have both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent activities. VAB-1 is expressed in neurons during epidermal enclosure and is required in these cells for normal epidermal morphogenesis, demonstrating that cell-cell interactions are required between neurons and epidermal cells for epidermal morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1983955493,"We have captured an 8.7 A conformational change that takes place in the cleavage site of the hammerhead ribozyme during self-cleavage, using X-ray crystallography combined with physical and chemical trapping techniques. This rearrangement brings the hammerhead ribozyme from the ground state into a conformation that is poised to form the transition state geometry required for hammerhead RNA self-cleavage. Use of a 5'-C-methylated ribose adjacent to the cleavage site permits this ordinarily transient conformational change to be kinetically trapped and observed crystallographically after initiating the hammerhead ribozyme reaction in the crystal. Cleavage of the corresponding unmodified hammerhead ribozyme in the crystal under otherwise identical conditions is faster than in solution, indicating that we have indeed trapped a catalytically relevant intermediate form of this RNA enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2010803132,"The molecular ion H 3 + is considered the cornerstone of interstellar chemistry because it initiates the reactions responsible for the production of many larger molecules. Recently discovered in dense molecular clouds, H 3 + has now been observed in the diffuse interstellar medium toward Cygnus OB2 No. 12. Analysis of H 3 + chemistry suggests that the high H 3 + column density (3.8 × 10 14 per square centimeter) is due not to a high H 3 + concentration but to a long absorption path. This and other work demonstrate the ubiquity of H 3 + and its potential as a probe of the physical and chemical conditions in the interstellar medium."

Calculations on simple reactions, such as H + D 2 → HD + D and F + H 2 → HF + H, compete with experiment in their accuracy. Recent advances in theory promise to extend such accurate predictions to more complicated reactions, such as OH + H 2 → H 2 O + H, and even to reactions of molecules on solid surfaces. New experimental techniques for probing reaction transition states, such as negative-ion photodetachment spectroscopy and pump-probe femtosecond spectroscopy, are stimulating the development of new theories."
https://openalex.org/W2063622359,"In female mammals a ""random choice"" mechanism decides which of the two X chromosomes will be inactivated. It has been postulated that Xist is crucial for heterochromatinization and thus functions downstream of the choice mechanism. Here we report that females heterozygous for an internal deletion in the Xist gene, which includes part of exon 1 and extends to exon 5, undergo primary nonrandom inactivation of the wild-type X chromosome. The Xist gene, therefore, not only has a role in chromatin remodeling, but also includes an element required for X chromosome choosing. In conflict with the prevailing view of how choosing occurs, the element identified by the deletion plays a positive role in the choice mechanism and forces a reassessment of how X chromosome choosing is thought to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2088098522,"The fusion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in yeast does not require Sec18p/NSF and Sec17p, two proteins needed for docking of vesicles with their target membrane. Instead, ER membranes require a NSF-related ATPase, Cdc48p. Since both vesicular and organelle fusion events use related ATPases, we investigated whether both fusion events are also SNARE mediated. We present evidence that the fusion of ER membranes requires Ufe1p, a t-SNARE that localizes to the ER, but no known v-SNAREs. We propose that the Ufe1 protein acts in the dual capacity of an organelle membrane fusion–associated SNARE by undergoing direct t-t-SNARE and Cdc48p interactions during organelle membrane fusion as well as a t-SNARE for vesicular traffic."
https://openalex.org/W2057691493,"Electron transfer, under conditions of weak interaction and a medium acting as a passive thermal bath, is very well understood. When electron transfer is accompanied by transient chemical bonding, such as in interfacial coordination electrochemical mechanisms, strong interaction and molecular selectivity are involved. These mechanisms, which take advantage of “passive self-organization,” cannot yet be properly described theoretically, but they show substantial experimental promise for energy conversion and catalysis. The biggest challenge for the future, however, may be dynamic, self-organized electron transfer. As with other energy fluxes, a suitable positive feedback mechanism, through an active molecular environment, can lead to a (transient) decrease of entropy equivalent to an increase of molecular electronic order for the activated complex. A resulting substantial increase in the rate of electron transfer and the possibility of cooperative transfer of several electrons (without intermediates) can be deduced from phenomenological theory. The need to extend our present knowledge may be derived from the observation that chemical syntheses and fuel utilization in industry typically require high temperatures (where catalysis is less relevant), whereas corresponding processes in biological systems are catalyzed at environmental conditions. This article therefore focuses on interfacial or membrane-bound electron transfer and investigates an aspect that nature has developed to a high degree of perfection: self-organization."

https://openalex.org/W1784440699,"Endurance exercise training has been shown to decrease diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) in rats and humans. In rodents, most thermogenesis is thought to occur in brown adipose tissue via activation of the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) and in skeletal muscle. Since the level of UCP1 mRNA in rat BAT was reported to be unmodified by exercise training, the newly described uncoupling proteins UCP2 and UCP3 could be responsible for the decreased DIT in trained rats. UCP3 mRNA levels in endurancetrained rats were found to be reduced by 76% and 59% in tibialis anterior and soleus muscles, respectively. UCP2 mRNA levels were also decreased in tibialis anterior and in heart by 54% and 41%, respectively. Neither white adipose tissue UCP2 nor brown adipose tissue UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 mRNA levels were modified. The results of this study show that a need for a higher metabolic efficiency is associated with decreased mRNA expression of the uncoupling proteins in skeletal and heart muscles, which would decrease energy dissipation in these tissues. The down-regulation of UCP3 and UCP2 expressions might also contribute to the rapid weight gain known to occur when exercise training ceased.—Boss, O., Samec, S., Desplanches, D., Mayet, M.-H., Seydoux, J., Muzzin, P., Giacobino, J.-P.

https://openalex.org/W1924491814,"Choline supplementation during fetal development [embryonic days (E) 11–17] permanently enhances memory performance in rats. To characterize the neurochemical mechanisms that may mediate this effect, we investigated the development of indices of the cholinergic system in the hippocampus: choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh) from choline transported by high-affinity choline uptake (HACU), and potassium-evoked ACh release. During E11–E17, Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats consumed 0 [choline-deficient (ChD)], 1.3 [control (ChC)], and 4.6 [choline-supplemented (ChS)] mmol/(kg • day) of choline, respectively. On postnatal days 17 and 27, hippocampi of the ChD animals had the highest AChE and ChAT activities, and increased synthesis of ACh from choline transported by HACU, concomitant with reductions of tissue ACh content relative to the ChC and ChS rats and an inability to sustain depolarization-evoked ACh release relative to the ChS animals. In contrast, AChE and ChAT activities, and ACh synthesized from choline transported by HACU, were lowest in ChS rats whereas depolarization-evoked ACh release was the highest. This pattern of changes suggests that the hippocampus of the ChD animals is characterized by fast ACh recycling and efficient choline reutilization for ACh synthesis, presumably to maintain adequate ACh release despite the decrease of the ACh pool, whereas in the ChS animals ACh turnover and choline recycling is slower while the evoked release of ACh is high. Together, the data show a complex adaptive response of the hippocampal cholinergic system to prenatal choline availability and provide a novel example of developmental plasticity in the nervous system governed by the supply of a single nutrient.—Cermak, J.

Here we report the solution structure of the binary complex formed between the core DNA-binding domain of human NFATC1 and the ARRE2 DNA site from the interleukin-2 promoter. The structure reveals that DNA binding induces the folding of key structural elements that are required for both sequence-specific recognition and the establishment of cooperative protein–protein contacts. The orientation of the NFAT DNA-binding domain observed in the binary NFATC1-DBD*/DNA complex is distinct from that seen in the ternary NFATC2/AP-1/DNA complex, suggesting that the domain reorients upon formation of a cooperative transcriptional complex."
https://openalex.org/W1975406396,A method involving electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of a site-selectively spin-labeled peripheral membrane protein in the presence and absence of membranes and of a water-soluble spin relaxant (chromium oxalate) has been developed to determine how bee venom phospholipase A2 sits on the membrane. Theory based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation shows that the rate of spin relaxation of a protein-bound nitroxide by a membrane-impermeant spin relaxant depends on the distance (up to tens of angstroms) from the spin probe to the membrane. The measurements define the interfacial binding surface of this secreted phospholipase A2.
https://openalex.org/W2132893816,"Translocational pausing is a mechanism used by certain specialized secretory proteins whereby discrete domains of a nascent chain destined for the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are transiently exposed to the cytosol. Proteoliposomes reconstituted from total endoplasmic reticulum proteins properly assemble translocationally paused intermediates. The capacity of the translocon to correctly pause the nascent chain is dependent on a glycoprotein fraction whose active component is TRAM. In the absence of TRAM, the normally sealed ribosome-membrane junction still opens in response to a pause transfer sequence. However, nascent chain domains that are not exposed to the cytosol in the presence of TRAM are so exposed in its absence. Thus, TRAM regulates which domains of the nascent chain are visible to the cytosol during a translocational pause."
https://openalex.org/W1961806688,"Cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) plays an important role in endothelial cell signaling. Although it has been suggested that the influx of Ca2+ can be triggered by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, the mechanism (or mechanisms) underlying this phenomenon needs further elaboration. In the present study, involvement of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling was investigated in agonist- and fluid flow-stimulated endothelial cells loaded with Ca2+-sensitive dyes. Bradykinin (BK) and thapsigargin caused an increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a sustained rise due to Ca2+ influx from extracellular space and shifted total myosin light-chain (MLC) from the unphosphorylated to the diphosphorylated form. ML-9 (100 microM), an inhibitor of MLCK, abolished Ca2+ influx and prevented MLC diphosphorylation in BK- and thapsigargin-treated cells, but did not affect Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores. Fluid flow stimulation (shear stress=5 dynes/cm2) increased [Ca2+]i and enhanced MLC phosphorylation. ML-9 also inhibited Ca2+ response and MLC phosphorylation in fluid flow-stimulated cells. The Ca2+ influx in response to BK was linearly correlated with the diphosphorylation of MLC in ML-9 treated cells. Effects of ML-5 and ML-7, analogs of ML-9, to inhibit Ca2+ influx paralleled their potencies to inhibit MLCK activity. These findings demonstrate that MLCK plays an essential role in regulating the plasmalemmal Ca2+ influx in agonist- and fluid flow-stimulated endothelial cells. This study is the first to report the close relationship between Ca2+ influx and MLC diphosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1655490658,"We demonstrate the presence and hair cycle-dependent expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and CRF receptors (CRF-R) in C57BL/6 mouse skin. To correlate this with a physiological, developmentally controlled tissue remodeling process, we have analyzed CRF and CRF-R expression during defined stages of the murine hair cycle with its rhythmic changes between growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and resting (telogen). Using reversed-phase HPLC combined with two independent anti-CRF radioimmunoassays, we have identified CRF in murine skin. Maximal CRF levels were found in anagen III-IV skin, and minimal values were detected in catagen and telogen skin. By immunofluorescence, maximal CRF immunoreactivity (CRF-IR) was seen in the basal epidermis, nerve bundles of skin, the outer root sheath and matrix region of anagen IV-VI follicles, and in defined sections of their perifollicular neural network, whereas catagen and telogen skin displayed minimal CRF-IR. Using quantitative autoradiography and 125I-CRF as a tracer, high-affinity binding sites for CRF were detected in murine skin. The highest density of specific binding sites was detected in the panniculus carnosus, the epidermis, and the hair follicle. CRF-R type 1 (CRF-R1) IR was detected by immunohistology mainly in the outer root sheath, hair matrix, and dermal papilla of anagen VI follicles, as well as in the inner and outer root sheaths of early catagen follicles. CRF-R1 expression was also hair cycle dependent. Therefore, in normal murine skin, the CRF-CRF-R signaling system may operate as an additional neuroendocrine pathway regulating skin functions, possibly in the context of cutaneous stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2098552880,"Prosaposin, the precursor of saposins A, B, C, and D, was recently reported to be a neurotrophic factor in vivo and in vitro. The neurotrophic region of prosaposin has been localized to a 12-amino acid sequence within the saposin C domain and has been used to derive biologically active synthetic peptides (14-22 residues), called prosaptides. Treatment of primary Schwann cells and an immortalized Schwann cell line, iSC, with a 14-mer prosaptide, TX14(A) (10 nM), enhanced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated kinases ERK1 (p44 MAPK) and ERK2 (p42 MAPK) within 5 min, which was blocked by 4 h pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Furthermore, incubation of Schwann cells with the nonhydrolyzable GDP analog GDP-betaS inhibited TX14(A)-induced ERK phosphorylation. TX14(A) enhanced the sulfatide content of primary Schwann cells by 2.5-fold, which was inhibited by pretreatment with pertussis toxin or the synthetic MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD098059. In addition, TX14(A) increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of all three isoforms of the adapter molecule, Shc, which coincided with the association of p60Src and PI(3)K. Inhibition of PI3(K) by wortmannin blocked TX14(A)-induced ERK phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that TX14(A) uses a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein pathway to activate ERKs, which is essential for enhanced sulfatide synthesis in Schwann cells."
https://openalex.org/W1931834543,"Activation of ion channels and the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+] play a key role in endothelial responses to hemodynamic forces and subsequent vasoregulation. In bovine aortic endothelial cells subjected to shear stress in a parallel flow chamber, we demonstrate shear stress activation of hyperpolarizing K+ currents that occur simultaneously with oscillating increases of [Ca2+]i Oscillating K+ currents, also known as spontaneous transient outward currents (STOC), were regulated in frequency and amplitude by the rate of shear stress in a range from 5 to 18 dyn/cm2. Activation of STOC depended on Ca2+ influx; current depended on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration and was blocked by 50 μM Gd3+. Emptying of Ca2+ stores by BHQ abolished current responses to shear stress. STOC activation was significantly reduced by cell dialysis with ryanodine (20 μM), but not heparin (200 μg/ml). Shear stress-induced STOC activation was also observed in the intact endothelium. The endothelial response to shear stress involves oscillating [Ca2+] increase and STOC activation, which depend on Ca2+ influx-induced Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive stores, demonstrating a new signaling pathway in endothelial mechanotransduction.—Hoyer, J., Köhler, R., Distler, A.

Group I (negative control) received human serum albumin intramurally. Group II (treatment) received PG-APS intramurally and P8720 orally. Group III (positive control) received PG-APS intramurally and albumin orally.

https://openalex.org/W1896196477,"Distributional changes of individual mRNAs between free ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNP) and ribosome-bound transcripts are used to assess translational control. Simultaneous analysis of many mRNA species is required to estimate the overall contribution of translation to the regulation of gene expression. To this purpose, total cytoplasmic RNA was fractionated in sucrose step gradients and poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from mRNP and ribosome-bound fractions. Since direct, simultaneous analysis of a profusion of mRNAs is not feasible, distribution of their in vitro translation products was examined after separation in 2-dimensional gels, followed by computer-based analysis of autoradiographs. When this analysis was applied to antigenically stimulated T cells, 36% of in vitro translation products showed a greater than 10-fold increase in intensity, suggesting transcriptional activation of the corresponding mRNAs. In comparison, 7.9% of individual mRNAs (54 of 685 species) were translationally activated. They were redistributed from free mRNP to ribosome-associated fractions; 4.7% (32 species) were translationally repressed, as indicated by the opposite pattern. The differential recruitment of 12.6% of mRNA species demonstrates specificity and the general significance of translational control during T cell activation, which implies that translation may play a similar role in regulating gene expression in a variety of physiological processes."

Their experiments are consistent with the continuum model of the mammalian division cycle. There is no need to postulate a restriction point or a G0 phase to explain the serum starvation results."
https://openalex.org/W1577523943,"The yeast plasma membrane, uracil permease, undergoes ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis and subsequent degradation in the vacuole via a process that does not involve the proteasome. Cell-surface ubiquitination of this protein is mediated by the ubiquitin-protein ligase Npi1p/Rsp5p and involves Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains. This report describes the intracellular fate of a mutant form of uracil permease carrying a three amino acid insertion in a cytoplasmic loop. Most of this protein is not deployed beyond the ER, and is degraded by the 26S proteasome. Mutant permease degradation is almost unaffected in cells with impaired Npi1p/Rsp5p, but is dependent on the Ubc6p and Ubc7p ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, suggesting that proteolysis of the protein requires its prior ubiquitination. Overproduction of a derivative of ubiquitin with a modified Lys48 strongly impairs mutant permease degradation. This suggests that, like other proteasome substrates, mutant permease might be polyubiquitinated with Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains. These findings provide an example of a yeast plasma membrane protein that is routed to the ‘ER degradation’ pathway, and highlight the versatility of the ubiquitin system.—Galan, J.-M., Cantegrit, B., Garnier, C., Namy, O., Haguenauer-Tsapis, R. ‘ER degradation’ of a mutant yeast plasma membrane protein by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
