https://openalex.org/W1967615338,"The apical parts of large volcanoes along the East Pacific Rise (islands and seamounts) are encrusted with rocks of the alkali volcanic suite (alkali basalt, andesine- and oligoclase-andesite, and trachyte). In contrast, the more submerged parts of the Rise are largely composed of a tholeiitic basalt which has low concentrations of K, P, U, Th, Pb, and Ti. This tholeiitic basalt is either the predominant or the only magma generated in the earth's mantle under oceanic ridges and rises. It is at least 1000-fold more abundant than the alkali suite, which is probably derived from tholeiitic basalt by magmatic differentiation in and immediately below the larger volcanoes. Distinction of oceanic tholeiites from almost all continental tholeiites is possible on the simple basis of total potassium content, with the discontinuity at 0.3 to 0.5 percent K(2)O by weight. Oceanic tholeiites also are readily distinguished from some 19 out of 20 basalts of oceanic islands and seamount cappings by having less than 0.3 percent K(2)O by weight and more than 48 percent SiO(2). Deep drilling into oceanic volcanoes should, however, core basalts transitional between the oceanic tholeiites and the presumed derivative alkali basalts. The composition of the oceanic tholeiites suggests that the mantle under the East Pacific Rise contains less than 0.10 percent potassium oxide by weight; 0.1 part per million of uranium and 0.4 part of thorium; a potassium:rubidium ratio of about 1200 and a potassium: uranium ratio of about 10(4)."

The proteinase is both synthesized and secreted by the maxillary galeae. The solvent derives from a pair of labial glands which have the form of long convoluted tubules lying alongside the foregut and opening to the exterior through a single aperture in the head."

Each copepod had 25 to 200 ciliates attached around the appendages. The infestation occurred at the time when Acartia tonsa was being replaced as the dominant copepod by Acartia clausi."
https://openalex.org/W2049429462,A good x-ray diffraction pattern has been obtained for the new phase of silver iodide stable in the vicinity of 3 kilobars at room temperature. A stability diagram of the six phases of silver iodide is presented to show the probable position of the narrow stability field of this phase. The x-ray diffraction data indicate that the cell symmetry of the new phase is probably orthorhombic.
https://openalex.org/W2073464088,"The examples discussed here represent only a small part of the published work relating to infrared spectra of adsorbed molecules. The publications in this field indicate that infrared spectroscopy is being used for surface chemistry research in about 50 laboratories throughout the world. This effort is mainly devoted to problems related to catalysis, and in this field infrared spectroscopy is the most widely used physical tool for surface chemistry studies. The general acceptance of infrared spectroscopy is primarily due to the fact that it provides information which is pertinent to the understanding of surface reactions on an atomic scale. During the last decade significant progress has also been made in the classical chemical techniques of catalysis study and in utilization of physical tools which depend on phenomena of magnetism, conductivity, low-energy electron diffraction, and electron emission. Probably the most important progress has been in the field of inorganic chemistry, where dramatic advances have been made in knowledge of metal coordination compounds. Such knowledge is vital to the understanding of catalysis on metal surfaces. I believe this progress has produced an attitude of sophisticated optimism among catalysis researchers with regard to eventual understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. This attitude is closely related to the realization that there is no ""secret of catalysis"" which places catalytic action beyond the limits of ordinary chemical knowledge (22). This view implies that the chemical aspects of heterogeneous catalysis are not unique and that the use of solid catalysts merely provides a highly effective exposure of catalytic atoms and facilitates separation of the products from the catalyst. Many capable catalysis researchers believe that studies of homogeneous catalysis provide the most direct route for the study of heterogeneous catalysis. Obviously homogeneous reactions catalyzed by compounds containing only one or two metal atoms do not leave room for effects associated with crystal parameters or with electronic band structure characteristic of the metallic state. At present, I believe, it is more reasonable to concede that these solid-state factors may play a role of secondary importance than to completely exclude them from consideration. The view that catalysis involves only conventional chemistry carried out under complicated conditions gives grounds for optimism, since it limits the boundaries of the problem. However, it also imposes a limitation on what might be expected from fundamental catalysis research. Most fundamental catalysis researchers do not rest their hopes on a single dramatic discovery which will make it possible to predict in detail the best catalyst for any specific reaction. The idea that catalysis researchers work with this goal in mind is as unrealistic as the idea that workers involved in practical catalysis development select constituents for catalysts by throwing darts at the periodic table. Although the fundamental catalysis researcher does not expect to advance ahead of general chemical knowledge, he does hope that he will not continue to lag behind. Infrared spectroscopy has provided a significant step toward closing the gap."
https://openalex.org/W2028860297,Spore discharge in basidiomycetes is effected primarily by the explosion of a small gas bubble in the area of the apiculus of the spore and by pressure of residual gas (probably carbon dioxide) that has accumulated between the inner wall and outer membrane of the spore apparatus. A somewhat similar mechanism of discharge has been discovered in an undescribed mycetozoan.
https://openalex.org/W1968848321,Sargasso Sea water has a variable strontium-chlorinity relationship. This observation is contrary to the view that strontium in the ocean is in constant proportion to chlorinity. It is suggested that the increase in strontium concentration at 500 to 800 meters in Sargasso Sea water results from interaction between organic aggregates and the water.

https://openalex.org/W2112185091,"Starhead topminnows from various shores of a small woodland pond were displaced to unfamiliar surroundings, and their orientation was tested in aquatic and terrestrial arenas. These fish used a sun compass to move in a direction which, at the location of their capture, would have returned them to the land-water interface. The fish accomplished directional terrestrial locomotion by using the position of the sun to align its body for each jump. On heavily overcast days many fish were unable to orient their bodies in a consistent direction from, jump to jump; this inability to orient resulted in random rather than linear movement. There was considerable individual variation in terrestrial locomotor ability."
https://openalex.org/W1980015688,"A narrow carbonate band consisting predominantly of Globigerina-rich sediments is present in the deep-sea deposits of the northeast Pacific Ocean extending almost parallel to the coasts of Oregon and Washington. Five radiocarbon dates in the cores from this area suggest that the greatest concentration of Globigerina-rich sediments occurred 27,000 to 12,000 years ago. This time interval corresponds roughly to the Vashon (late Wisconsin) glacial times in the Puget Lowland. The results suggest higher carbonate sedimentation in the northeast Pacific during glacial stages."

The oxalate ion has at least the symmetry 2mm and possibly the symmetry mmm. The calcium ion is coordinated with eight oxygen atoms arranged in the form of a distorted cubic antiprism."

https://openalex.org/W2022939866,"The report that damage to petunia has been correlated with the presence of aldehydes in the atmosphere is discussed in relation to recent laboratory findings. Laboratory investigations have shown that irradiation of formaldehyde in air will not cause plant damage to the varieties of petunia, pinto bean, and tobacco wrapper used, even when nitrogen oxide is added to the system. Irradiation of propionaldehyde in air does cause damage to these plants. Addition of nitrogen oxide to the irradiated propionaldehyde-in-air system does not markedly increase damage."

https://openalex.org/W2041395106,"Organic amines, present in very small concentrations (below 10-6M) in 0.1N H2SO4, cause a significant increase in hydrogen overvoltage, the effect being stronger the higher the molecular weight. The increase could be accounted for by the usual site-blockage concept. In the case of egg albumin, a drastic increase of over 300 mv was observed at 12.5 ma/cm2 for a concentration of only 0.01 part per million. A new mechanism is proposed in which the dielectric constant and hydrogen-ion activity are believed to be depressed in a region twice as thick as the usual transition region."
