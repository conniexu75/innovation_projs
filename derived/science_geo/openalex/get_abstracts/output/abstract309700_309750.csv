https://openalex.org/W2070589606,The cause of decadal climate variability over the North Pacific Ocean and North America is investigated by the analysis of data from a multidecadal integration with a state-of-the-art coupled ocean-atmosphere model and observations. About one-third of the low-frequency climate variability in the region of interest can be attributed to a cycle involving unstable air-sea interactions between the subtropical gyre circulation in the North Pacific and the Aleutian low-pressure system. The existence of this cycle provides a basis for long-range climate forecasting over the western United States at decadal time scales.

Embryogenesis in plants, therefore, is concerned primarily with establishing the basic shoot-root body pattern of the plant and accumulating food reserves that will be used by the germinating seedling after a period of embryonic dormancy within the seed. Recent genetics studies in Arabidopsis have identified genes that provide new insight into how embryos form during plant development. These studies, and others using molecular approaches, are beginning to reveal the underlying processes that control plant embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1965581798,"A phosphatized Middle Cambrian (∼510 million years ago) fauna from Duyun, southern China, has yielded fossil embryos that may be of arthropod affinity and could belong to the co-occurring eodiscid trilobite Pagetia sp. The shell was most likely flexible and possessed at least two thin layers. Four embryos reveal blastomeres, and two embryonic stages are represented. These embryos demonstrate that the basic paradigm for the growth of the invertebrate embryo has not changed in more than half a billion years."
https://openalex.org/W2000747848,"An atmospheric general circulation model was forced with observed interannual changes in the global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for the period 1982 to 1993. The simulated seasonal surface air temperature patterns over land areas closely resemble the observed. Over most of the globe, the patterns also resemble those associated with EI Niño events and are also reproduced in simulations with weak warm tropical SSTs near the date line. An exception is northern Asia, where the mechanisms for the observed warming are unclear. The results suggest that enhanced air-sea interactions resulting from recent, more persistent warm oceanic conditions in the tropics contributed to the observed global warming trend during this period."

https://openalex.org/W2042465540,"The tropical Pacific slipped into its warm mode in the winter of 1976-77 and has never quite shaken it off. The persistent warm spell in the ocean, computer climate modelers are finding, may have triggered the global climate shift that brought record-breaking warmth to the globe in the 1980's. Some climate researchers suspect that heat was an early sign of global warming from greenhouse gases. If so and if studies by the computer modelers are correct, the tropical Pacific may be a key link in the mechanism of climate change from one decade to the next. This would be a big boost to researchers attempting to understand climatic change as it would allow them to focus on one small, intensively studied region. However, uncertainty continues as a different climatic model identifies a very different ocean source for interdecadal climate change: a regular oscillation in the winds and currents of the North Pacific Ocean that could be masquerading temperarily as greenhouse warming. This article discusses the implications of these different ideas."

https://openalex.org/W2005422964,"Abstract Most of the properties of rubber are consistent with those expected of a high- molecular-weight linear polymer of isoprene. However, there are some features of its behavior that are inexplicable on this basis. They must be the result of the presence of small amounts of structures other than the regular head-to-tail chain of isoprene units. Bloomfield, in the first fundamental study of the properties of rubber from freshly tapped latex, found that the tree does not continue to build indefinitely a linear polymer, but that branching reactions occur in a rested tree. These reactions eventually convert individual latex particles into substantially single molecules of enormous molecular weight. Bloomfield also observed that small amounts of oxygen are intimately associated with the hydrocarbon, even when it is isolated directly from the tree with careful exclusion of atmospheric oxygen. Craig, Juve, and Davidson have found less certain indications of the presence of carboxyl groups, which, if they are..."
