https://openalex.org/W1978893674,"Alveoli are gas-exchange sacs lined by squamous alveolar type (AT) 1 cells and cuboidal, surfactant-secreting AT2 cells. Classical studies suggested that AT1 arise from AT2 cells, but recent studies propose other sources. Here we use molecular markers, lineage tracing and clonal analysis to map alveolar progenitors throughout the mouse lifespan. We show that, during development, AT1 and AT2 cells arise directly from a bipotent progenitor, whereas after birth new AT1 cells derive from rare, self-renewing, long-lived, mature AT2 cells that produce slowly expanding clonal foci of alveolar renewal. This stem-cell function is broadly activated by AT1 injury, and AT2 self-renewal is selectively induced by EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) ligands in vitro and oncogenic Kras(G12D) in vivo, efficiently generating multifocal, clonal adenomas. Thus, there is a switch after birth, when AT2 cells function as stem cells that contribute to alveolar renewal, repair and cancer. We propose that local signals regulate AT2 stem-cell activity: a signal transduced by EGFR-KRAS controls self-renewal and is hijacked during oncogenesis, whereas another signal controls reprogramming to AT1 fate. Lung alveoli are lined by two types of alveolar epithelial cells, squamous alveolar type (AT) 1 cells that mediate gas exchange and cuboidal AT2 cells that secrete surfactant to prevent alveolar collapse during breathing; here alveolar markers, genetic lineage tracing and clonal analysis are used in mice to identify alveolar progenitor and stem cells in vivo, and to map their locations and potential during lung development, maintenance and cancer. Pulmonary gas exchange occurs in delicate alveolar sacs lined by two epithelial cell types — squamous alveolar type (AT) 1 cells that mediate gas exchange and cuboidal AT2 cells that secrete surfactant to prevent alveolar collapse during breathing. Mark Krasnow and colleagues have used alveolar markers, genetic lineage tracing and clonal analysis to identify alveolar progenitor cells in vivo throughout the mouse lifespan. They find that AT1 and AT2 cells arise from a bipotential progenitor during development. After birth, mature AT2 cells function as facultative stem cells, forming slowly enlarging monoclonal foci of regenerated alveoli. The oncogenic Kras(G12D) mutation permanently activates AT2 self-renewal, hijacking this facultative stem cell function to initiate lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2132515584,"Nanoribbons of graphene grown on electronics-grade silicon carbide conduct electrons much better than expected; at room temperature, the charge carriers travel through the nanoribbons without scattering for a surprisingly long distance, more than ten micrometres. Graphene — the one-atom-thick layered form of carbon — has exceptional properties that make it of great interest for new types of high-speed electronic applications. Here Walt de Heer and colleagues show that the thin ribbons of graphene grown on the steep edges of a silicon carbide wafer are extremely efficient electronic conductors. Charge carriers travel through these graphene nanoribbons without scattering for a surprisingly long distance, more than 10 micrometres at room temperature, a performance comparable with that of metallic carbon nanotubes. High conductivity is predicted for graphene but these measurements surpass previous observations and theoretical expectations. Furthermore, electronic transport in these graphene nanoribbons is driven in two ways, one ballistic and temperature-independent and one thermally activated, opening up new directions for fundamental research in graphene properties as nanoelectronic devices. Graphene nanoribbons will be essential components in future graphene nanoelectronics1. However, in typical nanoribbons produced from lithographically patterned exfoliated graphene, the charge carriers travel only about ten nanometres between scattering events, resulting in minimum sheet resistances of about one kilohm per square2,3,4,5. Here we show that 40-nanometre-wide graphene nanoribbons epitaxially grown on silicon carbide6,7 are single-channel room-temperature ballistic conductors on a length scale greater than ten micrometres, which is similar to the performance of metallic carbon nanotubes. This is equivalent to sheet resistances below 1 ohm per square, surpassing theoretical predictions for perfect graphene8 by at least an order of magnitude. In neutral graphene ribbons, we show that transport is dominated by two modes. One is ballistic and temperature independent; the other is thermally activated. Transport is protected from back-scattering, possibly reflecting ground-state properties of neutral graphene. At room temperature, the resistance of both modes is found to increase abruptly at a particular length—the ballistic mode at 16 micrometres and the other at 160 nanometres. Our epitaxial graphene nanoribbons will be important not only in fundamental science, but also—because they can be readily produced in thousands—in advanced nanoelectronics, which can make use of their room-temperature ballistic transport properties."
https://openalex.org/W1977899163,"Although it is generally agreed that the Arctic flora is among the youngest and least diverse on Earth, the processes that shaped it are poorly understood. Here we present 50 thousand years (kyr) of Arctic vegetation history, derived from the first large-scale ancient DNA metabarcoding study of circumpolar plant diversity. For this interval we also explore nematode diversity as a proxy for modelling vegetation cover and soil quality, and diets of herbivorous megafaunal mammals, many of which became extinct around 10 kyr bp (before present). For much of the period investigated, Arctic vegetation consisted of dry steppe-tundra dominated by forbs (non-graminoid herbaceous vascular plants). During the Last Glacial Maximum (25–15 kyr bp), diversity declined markedly, although forbs remained dominant. Much changed after 10 kyr bp, with the appearance of moist tundra dominated by woody plants and graminoids. Our analyses indicate that both graminoids and forbs would have featured in megafaunal diets. As such, our findings question the predominance of a Late Quaternary graminoid-dominated Arctic mammoth steppe. By analysing plant and nematode DNA from sites all around the Arctic, it is shown that vegetation before about 10,000 years ago contained more forbs (non-graminoid herbaceous vascular plants) than previously believed, which changes our understanding about the functioning of the diverse northern ecosystem that existed at this time. The picture is a familiar one in reconstructions of the Late Quaternary in the far north of Eurasia: abundant mammoths and other now extinct megafauna grazing on grassy 'mammoth steppe' tundra. Analyses of the vegetation of this period have been based mainly on fossil pollen data. This study uses a more direct approach — the analysis of plant and nematode DNA from sites all around the Arctic — and the results paint a rather different picture, questioning the predominance of grasses and suggesting that grass dominance may not be necessary to sustain a diverse megafauna. Before about 10,000 years ago the vegetation contained many protein-rich forbs — herby plants that are not graminoids (grasses, reeds and sedges) — that would have played a large part in supporting this diverse northern ecosystem. After the Last Glacial Maximum, however, the woody plants and graminoids dominated. The authors conclude that megafauna such as woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, bison and horse may have been opportunistic mixed-feeders rather than grass specialists."
https://openalex.org/W2040299410,"Vaccines prevent infectious disease largely by inducing protective neutralizing antibodies against vulnerable epitopes. Several major pathogens have resisted traditional vaccine development, although vulnerable epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies have been identified for several such cases. Hence, new vaccine design methods to induce epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies are needed. Here we show, with a neutralization epitope from respiratory syncytial virus, that computational protein design can generate small, thermally and conformationally stable protein scaffolds that accurately mimic the viral epitope structure and induce potent neutralizing antibodies. These scaffolds represent promising leads for the research and development of a human respiratory syncytial virus vaccine needed to protect infants, young children and the elderly. More generally, the results provide proof of principle for epitope-focused and scaffold-based vaccine design, and encourage the evaluation and further development of these strategies for a variety of other vaccine targets, including antigenically highly variable pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus and influenza. Computational protein design methods are used to generate new candidates for a human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine; artificial protein scaffolds that mimic the structure of a RSV epitope are shown to induce RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies in macaques. William Schief and colleagues explore computational protein design methods to generate novel candidates for a human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Artificial protein scaffolds that mimic the structure of an RSV epitope or antigenic determinant are shown to induce RSV-neutralizing antibodies in macaques. The protein design method used here, that builds a protein around a functional motif in order to stabilize the conformation of that motif, could have broad application in vaccine development."

https://openalex.org/W2041177409,"Lidar and optical satellite observations of Amazon forests indicate consistent canopy structure and reflectance during the dry season, challenging the paradigm of light-limited tropical forest productivity. Recent remote-sensing data from the Amazon suggested that there is a 'green up' of vegetation during dry seasons, implying that light rather than water is the major limiting factor for forest productivity. Douglas Morton and colleagues have now reanalysed the evidence and show that the green up is in fact an optical artefact of the observation method, the result of changes in the relative azimuth angle of satellite observations between the June solstice and September equinox. Correcting for this removes the green-up phenomenon, adding support to other studies that indicate that water availability, rather than light, is the main driver of plant productivity in Amazon forests. The seasonality of sunlight and rainfall regulates net primary production in tropical forests1. Previous studies have suggested that light is more limiting than water for tropical forest productivity2, consistent with greening of Amazon forests during the dry season in satellite data3,4,5,6,7. We evaluated four potential mechanisms for the seasonal green-up phenomenon, including increases in leaf area5,6,7 or leaf reflectance3,4,6, using a sophisticated radiative transfer model8 and independent satellite observations from lidar and optical sensors. Here we show that the apparent green up of Amazon forests in optical remote sensing data resulted from seasonal changes in near-infrared reflectance, an artefact of variations in sun-sensor geometry. Correcting this bidirectional reflectance effect eliminated seasonal changes in surface reflectance, consistent with independent lidar observations and model simulations with unchanging canopy properties. The stability of Amazon forest structure and reflectance over seasonal timescales challenges the paradigm of light-limited net primary production in Amazon forests and enhanced forest growth during drought conditions. Correcting optical remote sensing data for artefacts of sun-sensor geometry is essential to isolate the response of global vegetation to seasonal and interannual climate variability."

https://openalex.org/W2027334559,"The hard spectra of X-ray binaries make them ineffective at heating primordial gas, which must have resulted in a delayed and spatially uniform heating during the epoch of reionization; this means that the signature of reionization in spectra of the 21-cm transition of atomic hydrogen will produce a more complex signal than has been predicted, including a distinct minimum at less than a millikelvin. The epoch of reionization was a one during which the neutral gas of the 'dark age' Universe became an ionized plasma. Simulations suggest that the 21-cm spectral transition of atomic hydrogen will show a clear fluctuation peak at a redshift and scale that mark the central stage of reionization. This prediction is based on the assumption that heating of the cosmic gas, which occurs before reionization, is caused by stellar remnants (particularly X-ray binaries) and reaches temperatures well above the cosmic microwave background of the time (30 kelvin). However, Rennan Barkana and colleagues report that the hard spectra of X-ray binaries (with more high-energy than low-energy photons) make such heating ineffective, resulting in a delayed and spatially uniform heating. In this new model, the 21-cm signature of reionization is modified to a more complex signal with a distinct minimum temperature (below 1 millikelvin) that marks the rise of the cosmic mean gas temperature above the microwave background. Models and simulations1,2,3,4 of the epoch of reionization predict that spectra of the 21-centimetre transition of atomic hydrogen will show a clear fluctuation peak, at a redshift and scale, respectively, that mark the central stage of reionization and the characteristic size of ionized bubbles. This is based on the assumption5,6,7 that the cosmic gas was heated by stellar remnants—particularly X-ray binaries—to temperatures well above the cosmic microwave background at that time (about 30 kelvin). Here we show instead that the hard spectra (that is, spectra with more high-energy photons than low-energy photons) of X-ray binaries8,9 make such heating ineffective, resulting in a delayed and spatially uniform heating that modifies the 21-centimetre signature of reionization. Rather than looking for a simple rise and fall of the large-scale fluctuations (peaking at several millikelvin), we must expect a more complex signal also featuring a distinct minimum (at less than a millikelvin) that marks the rise of the cosmic mean gas temperature above the microwave background. Observing this signal, possibly with radio telescopes in operation today, will demonstrate the presence of a cosmic background of hard X-rays at that early time."
https://openalex.org/W2068477954,"Mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC) proteins are molybdopterin-containing enzymes of unclear physiological function. Both human isoforms mARC-1 and mARC-2 are able to catalyze the reduction of nitrite when they are in the reduced form. Moreover, our results indicate that mARC can generate nitric oxide (NO) from nitrite when forming an electron transfer chain with NADH, cytochrome b5, and NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase. The rate of NO formation increases almost 3-fold when pH was lowered from 7.5 to 6.5. To determine if nitrite reduction is catalyzed by molybdenum in the active site of mARC-1, we mutated the putative active site cysteine residue (Cys-273), known to coordinate molybdenum binding. NO formation was abolished by the C273A mutation in mARC-1. Supplementation of transformed Escherichia coli with tungsten facilitated the replacement of molybdenum in recombinant mARC-1 and abolished NO formation. Therefore, we conclude that human mARC-1 and mARC-2 are capable of catalyzing reduction of nitrite to NO through reaction with its molybdenum cofactor. Finally, expression of mARC-1 in HEK cells using a lentivirus vector was used to confirm cellular nitrite reduction to NO. A comparison of NO formation profiles between mARC and xanthine oxidase reveals similar Kcat and Vmax values but more sustained NO formation from mARC, possibly because it is not vulnerable to autoinhibition via molybdenum desulfuration. The reduction of nitrite by mARC in the mitochondria may represent a new signaling pathway for NADH-dependent hypoxic NO production."

https://openalex.org/W2070246829,"ERα functions are tightly controlled by numerous post-translational modifications including arginine methylation, which is required to mediate the extranuclear functions of the receptor. We report that upon oestrogenic stimulation, JMJD6, the only arginine demethylase described so far, interacts with and regulates methylated ERα (metERα) function. Moreover, by combining the silencing of JMJD6 with demethylation assays, we show that metERα is a new substrate for JMJD6. We propose that the demethylase activity of JMJD6 is a decisive regulator of the rapid physiological responses to oestrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2076716719,"TNF expression is elevated in asthma and other inflammatory airway diseases that are commonly treated with glucocorticoid-based therapies, but the impact of glucocorticoids on negative feedback control of TNF is not well understood. We analyzed the effect of dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, on TNF-regulated gene expression in cultured airway epithelial cells. Although dexamethasone-mediated activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) potently repressed expression of IL1β, IL8, and several other pro-inflammatory TNF targets, the expression of anti-inflammatory TNF targets such as TNFAIP3 (A20) and NFKBIA was selectively spared or augmented by dexamethasone treatment. Despite divergent effects on gene expression, GR and NF-κB occupancy at the TNFAIP3 locus and GR-repressed targets was similar. A co-occupied intronic TNFAIP3 regulatory element mediated cooperative enhancement of transcription by GR and NF-κB that required the presence of a functional GR binding site (GBS). GBS exchanges between reporters for TNFAIP3 and FKBP5, a canonical GR-induced target, revealed substantial latitude in the GBS sequence requirements for GR/NF-κB cooperation, suggesting that the TNFAIP3 GBS acts primarily as a docking site in this context. Supporting this notion, a selective GR ligand with only weak agonist activity for induction of FKBP5 enabled robust GR/NF-κB cooperative induction of a mutant TNFAIP3 reporter harboring the FKBP5 GBS. Taken together, our data support a model in which the expression of anti-inflammatory targets of TNF is maintained during treatment with glucocorticoids through context-dependent cooperation between GR and NF-κB.

https://openalex.org/W2019305446,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene studies have identified a number of risk loci associated with the smoking-related disease COPD, a disorder that originates in the airway epithelium. Since airway basal cell (BC) stem/progenitor cells exhibit the earliest abnormalities associated with smoking (hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia), we hypothesized that smoker BC have a dysregulated transcriptome, enriched, in part, at known GWAS/candidate gene loci. Massive parallel RNA sequencing was used to compare the transcriptome of BC purified from the airway epithelium of healthy nonsmokers (n = 10) and healthy smokers (n = 7). The chromosomal location of the differentially expressed genes was compared to loci identified by GWAS to confer risk for COPD. Smoker BC have 676 genes differentially expressed compared to nonsmoker BC, dominated by smoking up-regulation. Strikingly, 166 (25%) of these genes are located on chromosome 19, with 13 localized to 19q13.2 (p<10⁻⁴ compared to chance), including 4 genes (NFKBIB, LTBP4, EGLN2 and TGFB1) associated with risk for COPD. These observations provide the first direct connection between known genetic risks for smoking-related lung disease and airway BC, the population of lung cells that undergo the earliest changes associated with smoking."

https://openalex.org/W2081705655,"Sphingolipids are essential components in eukaryotes and have various cellular functions. Recent developments in genome-editing technologies have facilitated gene disruption in various organisms and cell lines. We here show the disruption of various sphingolipid metabolic genes in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). A TALEN pair targeting the human CERT gene (alternative name COL4A3BP) encoding a ceramide transport protein induced a loss-of-function phenotype in more than 60% of HeLa cells even though the cell line has a pseudo-triploid karyotype. We have isolated several loss-of-function mutant clones for CERT, UGCG (encoding glucosylceramide synthase), and B4GalT5 (encoding the major lactosylceramide synthase), and also a CERT/UGCG double-deficient clone. Characterization of these clones supported previous proposals that CERT primarily contributes to the synthesis of SM but not GlcCer, and that B4GalT5 is the major LacCer synthase. These newly established sphingolipid-deficient HeLa cell mutants together with our previously established stable transfectants provide a ‘sphingolipid-modified HeLa cell panel,’ which will be useful to elucidate the functions of various sphingolipid species against essentially the same genomic background."
https://openalex.org/W2105179941,"The objective of this study was to examine the influence of cholesterol in post-translational control of ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein expression. Using CHO cell lines stably expressing human ABCA1 or ABCG1, we observed that the abundance of these proteins is increased by cell cholesterol loading. The response to increased cholesterol is rapid, is independent of transcription, and appears to be specific for these membrane proteins. The effect is mediated through cholesterol-dependent inhibition of transporter protein degradation. Cell cholesterol loading similarly regulates degradation of endogenously expressed ABCA1 and ABCG1 in human THP-1 macrophages. Turnover of ABCA1 and ABCG1 is strongly inhibited by proteasomal inhibitors and is unresponsive to inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis. Furthermore, cell cholesterol loading inhibits ubiquitination of ABCA1 and ABCG1. Our findings provide evidence for a rapid, cholesterol-dependent, post-translational control of ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels, mediated through a specific and sterol-sensitive mechanism for suppression of transporter protein ubiquitination, which in turn decreases proteasomal degradation. This provides a mechanism for acute fine-tuning of cholesterol transporter activity in response to fluctuations in cell cholesterol levels, in addition to the longer term cholesterol-dependent transcriptional regulation of these genes."

Current supportive therapy with corticosteroids results in a modest increase in strength as a consequence of a general reduction in inflammation, albeit with potential untoward long-term side effects and ultimate failure of the agent to maintain strength. Here, we demonstrate that alternative approaches that rescue defective autophagy in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with the use of rapamycin-loaded nanoparticles induce a reproducible increase in both skeletal muscle strength and cardiac contractile performance that is not achievable with conventional oral rapamycin, even in pharmacological doses. This increase in physical performance occurs in both young and adult mice, and, surprisingly, even in aged wild-type mice, which sets the stage for consideration of systemic therapies to facilitate improved cell function by autophagic disposal of toxic byproducts of cell death and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1973310934,"ARTEMIS is a member of the metallo-β-lactamase protein family. ARTEMIS has endonuclease activity at DNA hairpins and at 5'- and 3'-DNA overhangs of duplex DNA, and this endonucleolytic activity is dependent upon DNA-PKcs. There has been uncertainty about whether ARTEMIS also has 5'-exonuclease activity on single-stranded DNA and 5'-overhangs, because this 5'-exonuclease is not dependent upon DNA-PKcs. Here, we show that the 5'-exonuclease and the endonuclease activities co-purify. Second, we show that a point mutant of ARTEMIS at a putative active site residue (H115A) markedly reduces both the endonuclease activity and the 5'-exonuclease activity. Third, divalent cation effects on the 5'-exonuclease and the endonuclease parallel one another. Fourth, both the endonuclease activity and 5'-exonuclease activity of ARTEMIS can be blocked in parallel by small molecule inhibitors, which do not block unrelated nucleases. We conclude that the 5'-exonuclease is intrinsic to ARTEMIS, making it relevant to the role of ARTEMIS in nonhomologous DNA end joining."
https://openalex.org/W1974646124,"Members of the well-conserved mannose receptor (MR) protein family have been functionally implicated in diverse biological and pathological processes. Importantly, a proposed common function is the internalization of collagen for intracellular degradation occurring during bone development, cancer invasion, and fibrosis protection. This functional relationship is suggested by a common endocytic capability and a candidate collagen-binding domain. Here we conducted a comparative investigation of each member's ability to facilitate intracellular collagen degradation. As expected, the family members uPARAP/Endo180 and MR bound collagens in a purified system and internalized collagens for degradation in cellular settings. In contrast, the remaining family members, PLA2R and DEC-205, showed no collagen binding activity and were unable to mediate collagen internalization. To pinpoint the structural elements discriminating collagen from non-collagen receptors, we constructed a series of receptor chimeras and loss- and gain-of-function mutants. Using this approach we identified a critical collagen binding loop in the suggested collagen binding region (an FN-II domain) in uPARAP/Endo180 and MR, which was different in PLA2R or DEC-205. However, we also found that an active FN-II domain was not a sufficient determinant to allow collagen internalization through these receptors. Nevertheless, this ability could be acquired by the transfer of a larger segment of uPARAP/Endo180 (the Cys-rich domain, the FN-II domain and two CTLDs) to DEC-205. These data underscore the importance of the FN-II domain in uPARAP/Endo180 and MR-mediated collagen internalization but at the same time uncover a critical interplay with flanking domains."

The objective of this study was to identify the presence and characterize the ecology of MRSA in rats (Rattus spp.) from in an impoverished, inner-city neighborhood. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from rats trapped in 33 city blocks and one location within the adjacent port. Bacterial culture was performed and MRSA isolates were characterized using a variety of methods, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The ecology of MRSA in rats was described using phylogenetic analysis, geospatial analysis, and generalized linear mixed models. MRSA was identified 22 of 637 (3.5%) rats tested, although prevalence varied from 0 - 50% among blocks. Isolates belonged to 4 clusters according to WGS, with the largest cluster (n = 10) containing isolates that were genetically indistinguishable from community-acquired USA300 MRSA strains isolated from people within the study area. MRSA strains demonstrated both geographic clustering and dispersion. The odds of an individual rat carrying MRSA increased with increased body fat (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.33-4.82), and in the winter (OR = 5.29, 95% CI = 1.04-26.85) and spring (OR = 5.50, 95% CI = 1.10-27.58) compared to the fall. The results show that urban rats carried the same MRSA lineages occurring in local human and/or animal populations, supporting recent transmission from external sources. MRSA carriage was influenced by season, most likely as a result of temporal variation in rat behavior and rat-human interactions."

Cx43 has a highly regulated life cycle during which several, hierarchical phosphorylation events occur at several specific serine residues in its C terminus and occur during all stages of the cell cycle. These events change which proteins interact with Cx43, the kinetics and/or localization of Cx43 trafficking, assembly, gating, and turnover in a cell cycle stage-specific manner that affects important biological processes, such as cell migration and proliferation. Cx43 contains at least 12 serines and 2 tyrosines in its C terminus are known to be phosphorylated at key steps in its life cycle (1.Solan J.L. Lampe P.D.

Novel PKCs serve signaling functions in apoptosis, cardioprotection from ischemia, heat shock response, and insulin exocytosis (14.Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Protein kinase C and other diacylglycerol effectors in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Each isoform is believed to have a distinct role in cells; in early ischemic heart tissue, PKCδ and PKCϵ may regulate the opposite capabilities of apoptosis and cardioprotection, respectively. Studies of purified and reconstituted Cx43 hemichannels have shown that PKC phosphorylated Cx43 directly on Ser-368 (without other cellular factors), and that mutagenesis of Ser-368 to an Ala residue eliminated phosphorylation of Cx43 hemichannels preventing the decrease in dye and small molecule permeability (5.Bao X. Reuss L. Altenberg G.A. Regulation of purified and reconstituted connexin 43 hemichannels by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of serine 368.J. Biol.

Res. 2006; 98: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) demonstrated that early activation of Ser-368 through PKC phosphorylation was increased in ischemic hearts and that pSer368Cx43 remained predominantly at intercalated disks as intercellular channels and not hemichannels. Here, we examined the spatio-temporal localizations after stimulation of PKCδ using a kinase reporter system (15.Kajimoto T. Sawamura S. Tohyama Y. Mori Y. Newton A.C.

Chem. 2010; 285: 41896-41910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and a phospho-specific antibody for pSer368Cx43. Our goal was to determine the cellular locations of PKCδ-phosphorylated Cx43 as part of the synthetic, homeostatic, or degradative pathways. Previously, Lampe et al. (7.Lampe P.D. TenBroek E.M. Burt J.M. Kurata W.E. Johnson R.G. Lau A.F. Phosphorylation of connexin43 on serine368 by protein kinase C regulates gap junctional communication.J.

We fused a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based reporter for PKC δ activity, δ C kinase activity reporter (δCKAR) (15.Kajimoto T. Sawamura S. Tohyama Y. Mori Y. Newton A.C. Protein kinase C δ-specific activity reporter reveals agonist-evoked nuclear activity controlled by Src family of kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41896-41910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to the C terminus of Cx43 (Cx43-δCKAR) and expressed it in COS-7 cells. This reporter tag provides a significantly better FRET readout than a Cx43-CFP/YFP-PKCδ co-transfection to measure the interaction of substrate and kinase, and specifically reports PKCδ activity, rather than its translocation to Cx43. The δCKAR reporter tag contains a monomeric CFP, a phospho-Thr-binding FHA2 domain, a substrate peptide specifically phosphorylated by PKCδ on a Thr residue, and monomeric YFP. In the unphosphorylated state, monomeric CFP and YFP are in close enough proximity and orientation to FRET (16.Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. A genetically encoded fluorescent reporter reveals oscillatory phosphorylation by protein kinase C.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated by PKCδ at the threonine within the substrate sequence, the FHA2 domain binds the phosphorylated sequence, resulting in a conformational change that decreases the FRET ratio. Cx43-δCKAR localized to GJ plaques with morphologies similar to wild type and gets phosphorylated at Ser-368. A strong FRET signal was observed at the GJ plaques with a subset of channels having a stronger signal within the plaque. Time-lapse FRET imaging of Cx43-δCKAR after stimulation by the PKC activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu, a more water soluble version of TPA) caused a decrease in FRET within the GJ over time, with internalization and disappearance of pSer368Cx43 vesicles. Studies with PKC inhibitors showed that this is a specific response. Thus, phosphorylation by PKCδ at Ser-368 caused degradation of Cx43 channels and de-phosphorylation by phosphatases did not seem to be involved. For additional information about usage, below we provide antibody identification numbers in The Antibody Registry. Antibodies used for this study were: anti-pan-phospho-Cx43 (Sigma, catalog C6219, Antibody Registry ID AB_476857), pSer368Cx43 (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, catalog PPSO46, Antibody Registry ID AB_2110321). Unless specified otherwise, secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. The following antibodies were used as markers of subcellular compartments: anti-Rab4 (BD catalog number 610888, Antibody Registry ID AB_398205), anti-Clathrin (BD catalog number 610499, Antibody Registry ID AB_397865), anti-p47a/AP3M1 (BD catalog number 610890, AB_10015260), anti-LAMP1 (BD catalog number 611043, Antibody Registry ID AB_398356), and anti-26 S Proteasome antibody (AbCam catalog number AB58115, Antibody Registry ID AB_942116). Pharmacological agents PDBu, Gö6983, calyculin A, and bisindolylmaleimide (Bis IV) used in this study were obtained from EMB/Millipore (Calbiochem Division, Billerica, MA). δCKAR plasmids were constructed in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.0 as described in Ref. 17.Wu-Zhang A.X. Murphy A.N. Bachman M. Newton A.C. Isozyme-specific interaction of protein kinase Cδ with mitochondria dissected using live cell fluorescence imaging.J. Biol.

We cloned Cx43 into the pcDNA3.0 δCKAR using a BamHI restriction site and incorporated a 9-amino acid linker consisting of GSAAASFAT between the end of Cx43 and the beginning of the CFP.

COS-7 cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator with regular medium (low glucose DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum). They were transfected roughly 48 h after plating in MatTek dishes using FuGENE 6 (Promega) and TransfectaGRO Medium (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection with Cx43-δCKAR or Cx43-δCKAR and RFP-PKCδ constructs, COS-7 cells were refreshed in Opti-MEM without phenol red (Invitrogen, catalog number 11058-021) and then imaged. All other cell lines were cultured at 10% CO2 with regular medium. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and allowed to grow for ∼48 h in regular medium before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min or, for transiently transfected cells, 100% cold methanol for 15 s followed by 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After being rinsed in 0.1% Triton X-100 and then blocking solution (2% NDS, 1 m glycine, 5% bovine serum albumin, final concentrations), the cells were exposed to two primary antibodies: anti-pSer368Cx43 to target serine 368-phosphorylated Cx43, and Sigma pan-phospho-Cx43 that labels all Cx43 phospho-forms present in the cell. Because both the pSer368Cx43 and the pan-phospho-Cx43 antibodies are rabbit polyclonal species, we used the Zenon Tricolor Rabbit IgG Labeling Kit 1 (Invitrogen, catalog number Z-25360) to label them with fluorophores with different spectral properties. The Zenon reagent is a ligand derived from a secondary antibody that is then conjugated to a fluorophore. The Zenon reagents were directly attached to their respective primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were incubated with the labeled anti-pSer368Cx43 primary overnight at 4 °C, labeled with anti-pan-phospho-Cx43 for 1 h at room temperature, and then post-fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. The cells were rinsed with PBS, some were stained with DAPI, rinsed again with PBS, and then mounted on slides using Gelvatol. In the case of correlated immunolabeling of various organelles with the anti-pSer-368 antibody, the same process of fixation and rinsing was performed. However, after initial overnight labeling with anti-pSer368 attached to Zenon 568, coverslips were exposed to primary antibodies targeting proteins in degradation and synthesis pathways for 1 h at various concentrations. The primary mouse antibodies were secondarily detected by incubating with donkey anti-mouse CY5 secondary antibody for 1 h, whereas the rabbit primary was directly detected using the Zenon 647 reagent. The coverslips were rinsed in PBS, and then mounted on microscopy slides using Gelvatol. Confocal immunofluorescence images were acquired on the Olympus Fluoview 1000 microscope using a ×60 oil immersion objective with numerical aperture 1.42. The pixel size is 0.069 μm/pixel. Acquired images were 1024 by 1024 pixels for a field size of 70.6 by 70.6 μm. For normal rat kidney (NRK) cells labeled with a double Zenon kit, the pSer368Cx43 antibody was bound to Zenon-Alexa 568, whereas the Zenon-Alexa 488 was attached to the pan-Cx43 antibody. Specimens were imaged with 568 nm laser and a 488 nm laser, respectively. COS-7 cells transfected with Cx43-δCKAR were labeled with anti-pSer368Zenon-Alexa 568 and another Ab against various cell markers secondarily detected using donkey anti-mouse-Cy5 (Jackson Laboratories) or Zenon-Alexa 647 (kit used on rabbit anti-LAMP1) and imaged with 488 nm laser (YFP/CFP), 568 nm laser (pSer368Cx43), and 633 nm laser (various cell markers). Cell lysates of NRK cells endogenously expressing Cx43 or COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the Cx43-δCKAR construct were made following published methods (19.Sosinsky G.E. Solan J.L. Gaietta G.M. Ngan L. Lee G.J. Mackey M.R. Lampe P.D. The C-terminus of connexin43 adopts different conformations in the Golgi and gap junction as detected with structure-specific antibodies.Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed on 10% and 4–20% PAGE gels for Cx43 and Cx43-δCKAR, respectively. Transfer was performed using iBlot (Invitrogen). Western blots were made using the Sigma pan-phospho-Cx43, pSer368Cx43 antibodies, and Luminata Forte (EMD-Millipore) was used as ECL substrate. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×100 objective with numerical aperture 1.4 on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) with a MicroMax digital camera (Roper-Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). The imaging itself was done through the MetaFluor Program (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Every 15 s, an image was acquired through a 10% neutral density filter using three channel settings. CFP and FRET images were obtained through a 420/20-nm excitation filter, a 450-nm dichroic mirror, and either a 475/40-nm emission filter (CFP) or a 535/25-nm emission filter (FRET). To control for photobleaching, YFP images were obtained through a 495/10-nm excitation filter, a 505-nm dichroic mirror, and a 535/25-nm emission filter. RFP images, used to visualize the movement of PKCδ, were obtained through a 560/25-nm excitation filter, a 593-nm dichroic mirror, and a 629/53-nm emission filter. Integration times were 200 ms for CFP and FRET and 100 ms for YFP and RFP. The imaging process was done at room temperature in a darkened room. During the experiment, a baseline time of ∼15 min was established before treatment of the COS-7 cells. After this time, various stimulants (UTP, PDBu) or inhibitors (Gö6983, calyculin A, Bis IV) were added. The cells were then observed for ∼25 min after treatment, unless another drug was to be added several minutes later. We used FIJI, a bundled distribution package of ImageJ (20.Schindelin J. Arganda-Carreras I. Frise E. Kaynig V. Longair M. Pietzsch T. Preibisch S. Rueden C. Saalfeld S. Schmid B. Tinevez J.Y. White D.J. Hartenstein V. Eliceiri K. Tomancak P. Cardona A. FIJI. An open-source platform for biological-image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30641) Google Scholar) to construct regions of interest (ROIs) around key areas of the COS-7 cells to measure both CFP and FRET intensities. Using ROIs drawn in FIJI, the intensities of separate channels were measured and stored in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. After several rounds of calculations and analysis, individual experiments were averaged together to produce a final set of graphs. Sample sizes were typically taken for 4–6 runs that could each contain multiple gap junction ROIs. Animations for each experiment were made using FIJI to convert the image stack into ∼10-s time lapse movies, showing the change of FRET/CFP ratio in the cell. Supplemental movies were made by combining individual animations using FIJI. Text for movies were made in a black frame using Photoshop and overlaid in FIJI. AVI movies were converted to Quicktime format using Quicktime Pro (Apple, Sunnyvale, CA). ROIs were drawn on raw image stacks to encompass four particular areas of the cell (gap junction plaques, Golgi, cytoplasm, and nucleus). To obtain a CFP/FRET ratio for graphing, the following equation was implemented, CFP / FRET Ratio = Average ROI pixel intensity ( CFP ) Average ROI pixel intensity ( FRET ) (Eq. 1) except for the UTP experiments for which background-subtracted CFP intensities were divided by background-subtracted FRET intensities. ROIs were drawn on regions of the images where no cells were present for background measurements. In the equation, the average ROI intensity of a particular fluorophore channel is represented by the average pixel intensity within all ROIs of the same type in one frame. The ratio was calculated, and then the same process was applied to every frame of the time lapse movie. The baseline and slope of these values were then calculated and the resulting data were plotted in Excel. Finally, to average different runs together, the timelines of each experiment were synchronized together and their values were averaged accordingly. Mean ± S.E. was calculated to generate error bars for each data point. Although Cx43 is primarily found in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, another important localization during its life cycle is within cytoplasmic vesicles. The phosphorylation of Cx43 at Ser-368 while trafficking through the cytoplasm in vesicles was graphed separately as a histogram. After thresholding the images, the FIJI Particle Analysis tool was used to automatically draw hundreds of ROIs around vesicles in every frame of the time lapse data. This allowed the acquisition of the pixel intensities in these vesicles across the entire movie. Vesicles from 20 adjacent frames (5 min) were analyzed together to have significant numbers to measure, creating a snapshot within the dataset. Vesicles were measured before treatment, at treatment, and after treatment (see inset, Fig. 7A). This analysis utilized data from 60 frames of each data set to give 3 distinct snapshots of the experiments. The FRET ratio values of the vesicles in each snapshot were binned, counted, normalized to the average FRET ratio of all vesicles before treatment, and graphed as a histogram. Some datasets contained fewer vesicle ROIs than others. To normalize and average the different runs, the number of vesicles in each bin is shown as a percentage of all the vesicles in the run. Error bars are S.E. To quantify complex co-localization patterns between antibodies against two different proteins, Pearson coefficients were calculated as a measure of pixel-by-pixel cross-correlation coefficients scaled from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (complete overlap). Pearson coefficients were calculated utilizing the Coloc2 tool in FIJI (21.Costes S.V. Daelemans D. Cho E.H. Dobbin Z. Pavlakis G. Lockett S. Automatic and quantitative measurement of protein-protein colocalization in live cells.Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3993-4003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 22.Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. Measurement of co-localization of objects in dual-colour confocal images.J. Microsc. 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Multiple image sets were taken from similarly prepared slides and were inputted into Coloc2. Once numerous Pearson coefficients were generated, a bar graph with an average value and S.E. bar was created. Parental HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a Cx43-δCKAR construct using FuGENE 6 reagent (Promega). A solution of Alexa 568 dye (2 mm in 200 mm KCl, Invitrogen) was injected into cells expressing each of the constructs as gap junctions (as first identified based on the YFP fluorescence at cell appositional areas). Parental HeLa cells (gap junction deficient) were also injected in each experiment to serve as negative controls. Dye injections were performed on a BX50WI Olympus infrared differential interference contrast/epifluorescent microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY) equipped with a ×40 water immersion objective. A fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set was used before injection to image the Cx43-δCKAR expression, and a rhodamine filter set was used after injection to image the Alexa 568. Epifluorescent images of the Alexa 568 dye were captured after each injection with a Nikon D300 digital camera. Although we first started our experiments with intermolecular FRET (YFP-PKCδ and Cx43-CFP) to examine the recruitment of PKCδ to Cx43, we found the interaction of PKC with Cx43 occurred too quickly and too transiently for good spatio-temporal resolution. This was not unexpected, as the agonist-evoked interaction of PKCδ with Cx43 would be a fast and temporary event. Rather, we used the approach of a “biosensor,” a FRET reporter that would permanently remain tethered to the Cx43, optimized to give a localized signal, reflecting not only the phosphorylation of the reporter, but mimicking the phosphorylation of Ser-368. However, as with any genetically appended tag, we first compared the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of Cx43 in an endogenously expressing (“native”) system to that of the tagged Cx43 species to make sure they trafficked similarly. NRK cells represent an excellent system for ensuring that tagged forms of Cx43 behave similarly. NRK cells are a canonical Cx43 endogenously expressing cell line with expression patterns similar to those seen in tissue. Quiescent, unstimulated NRK cells contain a “necklace” of ∼0.5-μm gap junctions between apposing cells. Fig. 1 shows co-localization of pan-phospho-Cx43 (all phospho-forms, shown in red) and pSer368Cx43 (green) by immunofluorescence. In unstimulated, quiescent cells, pSer368Cx43 is typically found at low levels interspersed within gap junction plaques as seen in Fig. 1A. After activation by 200 nm PDBu for 15–30 min, pSer368Cx43 segregated into “islands” or subdomains within gap junction plaques as evidenced by the appearance of yellow co-labeling (Fig. 1, B and D). Most plaques in NRK cells were small and in general, we did not see systematic increases in plaque size after PDBu treatment. However, the larger plaque in the representative image selected for Fig. 1B (shown at higher magnification in Fig. 1D) was chosen because it clearly showed the segregation of pSer-368 labeling. A Western blot analysis with these two antibodies revealed differences in phosphorylation before and after PDBu treatment (Fig. 1, E and G). As established first as described in Ref. 23.Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. Differential phosphorylation of the gap junction protein connexin43 in junctional communication-competent and -deficient cell lines.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, Cx43 in NRK cell lysates were separated on Western blots into three macroscopic phospho-bands (termed P0, P1, and P2) w"
https://openalex.org/W1970763876,"Direct linkage between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton is controlled by the protein ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin protein family. To function as a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, ezrin needs to be activated in a process that involves binding of ezrin to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue. Here, we used colloidal probe microscopy to quantitatively analyze the interaction between ezrin and F-actin as a function of these activating factors. We show that the measured individual unbinding forces between ezrin and F-actin are independent of the activating parameters, in the range of approximately 50 piconewtons. However, the cumulative adhesion energy greatly increases in the presence of PIP2 demonstrating that a larger number of bonds between ezrin and F-actin has formed. In contrast, the phosphorylation state, represented by phosphor-mimetic mutants of ezrin, only plays a minor role in the activation process. These results are in line with in vivo experiments demonstrating that an increase in PIP2 concentration recruits more ezrin to the apical plasma membrane of polarized cells and significantly increases the membrane tension serving as a measure of the adhesion sites between the plasma membrane and the F-actin network."
https://openalex.org/W1973668179,"A healthy lifestyle is an important focus in today's society. The physical benefits of regular exercise are abundantly clear, but physical fitness is also associated with better cognitive performance. How these two factors together relate to characteristics of the brain is still incompletely understood. By applying mathematical concepts from 'network theory', insights in the organization and dynamics of brain functioning can be obtained. We test the hypothesis that neural network organization mediates the association between cardio respiratory fitness (i.e. VO₂ max) and cognitive functioning. A healthy cohort was studied (n = 219, 113 women, age range 41-44 years). Subjects underwent resting-state eyes-closed magneto-encephalography (MEG). Five artifact-free epochs were analyzed and averaged in six frequency bands (delta-gamma). The phase lag index (PLI) was used as a measure of functional connectivity between all sensors. Modularity analysis was performed, and both within and between-module connectivity of each sensor was calculated. Subjects underwent a maximum oxygen uptake (VO₂ max) measurement as an indicator of cardio respiratory fitness. All subjects were tested with a commonly used Dutch intelligence test. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was related to VO₂ max. In addition, VO₂ max was negatively associated with upper alpha and beta band modularity. Particularly increased intermodular connectivity in the beta band was associated with higher VO₂ max and IQ, further indicating a benefit of more global network integration as opposed to local connections. Within-module connectivity showed a spatially varied pattern of correlation, while average connectivity did not show significant results. Mediation analysis was not significant. The occurrence of less modularity in the resting-state is associated with better cardio respiratory fitness, while having increased intermodular connectivity, as opposed to within-module connections, is related to better physical and mental fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2024298701,"Farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor-alpha (FXR/RXRα) is the master transcriptional regulator of bile salt synthesis and transport in liver and intestine. FXR is activated by bile acids, RXRα by the vitamin A-derivative 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA). Remarkably, 9cRA inhibits binding of FXR/RXRα to its response element, an inverted repeat-1 (IR-1). Still, most FXR/RXRα target genes are maximally expressed in the presence of both ligands, including the small heterodimer partner (SHP). Here, we revisited the FXR/RXRα-mediated regulation of human SHP.A 579-bp hSHP promoter element was analyzed to locate FXR/chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)- and RXRα/9cRA-responsive elements. hSHP promoter constructs were analyzed in FXR/RXRα-transfected DLD-1, HEK293 and HepG2 cells exposed to CDCA, GW4064 (synthetic FXR ligand) and/or 9cRA. FXR-DNA interactions were analyzed by in vitro pull down assays.hSHP promoter elements lacking the previously identified IR-1 (-291/-279) largely maintained their activation by FXR/CDCA, but were unresponsive to 9cRA. FXR-mediated activation of the hSHP promoter was primarily dependent on the -122/-69 region. Pull down assays revealed a direct binding of FXR to the -122/-69 sequence, which was abrogated by site-specific mutations in a binding site for the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) at -78/-70. These mutations strongly impaired the FXR/CDCA-mediated activation, even in the context of a hSHP promoter containing the IR-1. LRH-1 did not increase FXR/RXRα-mediated activation of hSHP promoter activity.FXR/CDCA-activated expression of SHP is primarily mediated through direct binding to an LRH-1 binding site, which is not modulated by LRH-1 and unresponsive to 9cRA. 9cRA-induced expression of SHP requires the IR-1 that overlaps with a direct repeat-2 (DR-2) and DR-4. This establishes for the first time a co-stimulatory, but independent, action of FXR and RXRα agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2018533661,"To function as intended in vivo, a majority of biopharmaceuticals require specific glycan distributions. However, achieving a precise glycan distribution during manufacturing can be challenging because glycosylation is a non-template driven cellular process, with the potential for significant uncontrolled variability in glycan distributions. As important as the glycan distribution is to the end-use performance of biopharmaceuticals, to date, no strategy exists for controlling glycosylation on-line. However, before expending the significant amount of effort and expense required to develop and implement on-line control strategies to address the problem of glycosylation heterogeneity, it is imperative to assess first the extent to which the very complex process of glycosylation is controllable, thereby establishing what is theoretically achievable prior to any experimental attempts. In this work, we present a novel methodology for assessing the output controllability of glycosylation, a prototypical example of an extremely high-dimensional and very non-linear system. We first discuss a method for obtaining the process gain matrix for glycosylation that involves performing model simulations and data analysis systematically and judiciously according to a statistical design of experiments (DOE) scheme and then employing Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine the elements of process gain matrix from the resulting simulation data. We then discuss how to use the resulting high-dimensional gain matrix to assess controllability. The utility of this method is demonstrated with a practical example where we assess the controllability of various classes of glycans and of specific glycoforms that are typically found in recombinant biologics produced with Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. In addition to providing useful insight into the extent to which on-line glycosylation control is achievable in actual manufacturing processes, the results also have important implications for genetically engineering cell lines design for enhanced glycosylation controllability."
https://openalex.org/W2033669175,"OASIS is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transmembrane transcription factor that is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Previously, we showed that OASIS regulates final maturation of goblet cells in the large intestine. In the present study, to elucidate the roles of OASIS under pathophysiological conditions, we examined the stress response and inflammatory responses in Oasis deficient (Oasis−/−) mice exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis. A significant loss of body weight and an increase of mortality were observed in Oasis−/− mice with DSS-induced colitis compared with those in WT mice. The mucosa of the large intestine in Oasis−/− mice exhibited severe damage involving inflammatory cell infiltration. The expression levels of ER stress and apoptosis markers in intestinal epithelial cells were upregulated in Oasis−/− mice. These abnormalities were improved by treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid, a chemical chaperone that facilitates protein folding. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that OASIS plays important roles in protection of the large intestinal mucosa in DSS-induced colitis through attenuation of ER stress and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2045008141,"Pharmacological Relevance Ethyl pyruvate (EP), a potent reactive oxygen species scavenger, has been reported to contribute to the inflammatory process. However, the protective effect of ethyl pyruvate on Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced autoimmune hepatitis have not been explored. Thus, the aims of this study are to investigate both the effects of ethyl pyruvate and its mechanism of protection on Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice. Materials and Methods Acute autoimmune hepatitis was induced by Con A (20 mg/kg) in Balb/C mice; ethyl pyruvate (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) was administrated 1h prior to the Con A injection. At 3h, 6h and 24h post Con A injection, histological grading, proinflammatory cytokine levels and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity were determined. Results Following Con A challenge, cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IL-1β and IL-6 were expressed at 3h and 6h, and the level of HMGB1 significantly increased by 24h. Pretreatment with ethyl pyruvate ameliorated the pathological effects of Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis and significantly decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-1β at 3h and 6h and the level of HMGB1 at 6h and 24h post injection. Ethyl pyruvate blocked the degradation of IκB α and IκB β and decreased the expression of NF-κB at 24h. Conclusion Taken together, these results indicated that ethyl pyruvate protected against Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis by decreasing both early (TNF-α, IL-2, IL-1β and IL-6) and late (HMGB1) cytokine expression in mice. The reduction of HMGB1 may correlate with the amelioration of NF-κB activity."
https://openalex.org/W2014476842,"Plant cytochrome P450 has diverse roles in developmental processes and in the response to environmental cues. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa L ssp. indica cultivar 3037) semi-dwarf mutant sd37, in which the gene CYP96B4 (Cytochrome P450 96B subfamily) was identified and confirmed as the target by map-based cloning and a complementation test. A point mutation in the SRS2 domain of CYP96B4 resulted in a threonine to lysine substitution in the sd37 mutant. Examination of the subcellular localization of the protein revealed that SD37 was ER-localized protein. And SD37 was predominantly expressed in the shoot apical meristem and developing leaf and root maturation zone but not in the root apical meristem. The sd37 leaves, panicles, and seeds were smaller than those of the wild type. Histological analysis further revealed that a decrease in cell number in the mutant, specifically in the shoots, was the main cause of the dwarf phenotype. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of several cell division-related genes was disturbed in the sd37 mutant. In addition, mutation or strongly overexpression of SD37 results in dwarf plants but moderate overexpression increases plant height. These data suggest that CYP96B4 may be an important regulator of plant growth that affects plant height in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2079786684,"Adaptor protein (AP) complexes facilitate protein trafficking by playing key roles in the selection of cargo molecules to be sorted in post-Golgi compartments. Four AP complexes (AP-1 to AP-4) contain a medium-sized subunit (μ1-μ4) that recognizes YXXØ-sequences (Ø is a bulky hydrophobic residue), which are sorting signals in transmembrane proteins. A conserved, canonical region in μ subunits mediates recognition of YXXØ-signals by means of a critical aspartic acid. Recently we found that a non-canonical YXXØ-signal on the cytosolic tail of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) binds to a distinct region of the μ4 subunit of the AP-4 complex. In this study we aimed to determine the functionality of both binding sites of μ4 on the recognition of the non-canonical YXXØ-signal of APP. We found that substitutions in either binding site abrogated the interaction with the APP-tail in yeast-two hybrid experiments. Further characterization by isothermal titration calorimetry showed instead loss of binding to the APP signal with only the substitution R283D at the non-canonical site, in contrast to a decrease in binding affinity with the substitution D190A at the canonical site. We solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of the D190A mutant bound to this non-canonical YXXØ-signal. This structure showed no significant difference compared to that of wild-type μ4. Both differential scanning fluorimetry and limited proteolysis analyses demonstrated that the D190A substitution rendered μ4 less stable, suggesting an explanation for its lower binding affinity to the APP signal. Finally, in contrast to overexpression of the D190A mutant, and acting in a dominant-negative manner, overexpression of μ4 with either a F255A or a R283D substitution at the non-canonical site halted APP transport at the Golgi apparatus. Together, our analyses support that the functional recognition of the non-canonical YXXØ-signal of APP is limited to the non-canonical site of μ4."
https://openalex.org/W1988720872,"Background Tuberculosis is a serious global health problem. Its paradigms are shifting through time, especially in rapidly developing countries such as China. Health providers in China are at the forefront of the battle against tuberculosis; however, there are few empirical studies on health providers' perspectives on the challenges they face in tuberculosis control at the county level in China. This study was conducted among health providers to explore their experiences with tuberculosis control in order to identify bottlenecks and emerging challenges in controlling tuberculosis in rural China. Methods A qualitative approach was used. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 17 health providers working in various positions within the health system of one rural county (ZJG) of China. Data were analyzed based on thematic content analysis using MAXQDA 10 qualitative data analysis software. Results Health providers reported several problems in tuberculosis control in ZJG county. Migrant workers and the elderly were repeatedly documented as the main obstacles in effective tuberculosis control in the county. At a personal level, doctors showed their frustration with the lack of new drugs for treating tuberculosis patients, and their opinions varied regarding incentives for referring patients. Conclusion The results suggest that several problems still remain for controlling tuberculosis in rural China. Tuberculosis control efforts need to make reaching the most vulnerable populations a priority and encourage local health providers to adopt innovative practices in the local context based on national guidelines to achieve the best results. Considerable changes in China's National Tuberculosis Control Program are needed to tackle these emerging challenges faced by health workers at the county level."
https://openalex.org/W2016980004,"TFAP4, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates the expression of a multitude of genes involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, stemness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, is up-regulated in colorectal cancer and a number of other human malignancies. We have found that, during the G2 phase of the cell division cycle, TFAP4 is targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation by the SCF(βTrCP) ubiquitin ligase. This event requires phosphorylation of TFAP4 on a conserved degron. Expression of a stable TFAP4 mutant unable to interact with βTrCP results in a number of mitotic defects, including chromosome missegregation and multipolar spindles, which eventually lead to the activation of the DNA damage response. Our findings reveal that βTrCP-dependent degradation of TFAP4 is required for the fidelity of mitotic division."
https://openalex.org/W2052423822,"Nitrogen (N) deposition and its ecological effects on forest ecosystems have received global attention. Plantations play an important role in mitigating climate change through assimilating atmospheric CO2. However, the mechanisms by which increasing N additions affect net ecosystem production (NEP) of plantations remain poorly understood. A field experiment was initialized in May 2009, which incorporated additions of four rates of N (control (no N addition), low-N (5 g N m−2 yr−1), medium-N (10 g N m−2 yr−1), and high-N (15 g N m−2 yr−1)) at the Saihanba Forestry Center, Hebei Province, northern China, a locality that contains the largest area of plantations in China. Net primary production (NPP), soil respiration, and its autotrophic and heterotrophic components were measured. Plant tissue carbon (C) and N concentrations (including foliage, litter, and fine roots), microbial biomass, microbial community composition, extracellular enzyme activities, and soil pH were also measured. N addition significantly increased NPP, which was associated with increased litter N concentrations. Autotrophic respiration (AR) increased but heterotrophic respiration (HR) decreased in the high N compared with the medium N plots, although the HR in high and medium N plots did not significantly differ from that in the control. The increased AR may derive from mycorrhizal respiration and rhizospheric microbial respiration, not live root respiration, because fine root biomass and N concentrations showed no significant differences. Although the HR was significantly suppressed in the high-N plots, soil microbial biomass, composition, or activity of extracellular enzymes were not significantly changed. Reduced pH with fertilization also could not explain the pattern of HR. The reduction of HR may be related to altered microbial C use efficiency. NEP was significantly enhanced by N addition, from 149 to 426.6 g C m−2 yr−1. Short-term N addition may significantly enhance the role of plantations as an important C sink."
https://openalex.org/W2086866499,"Biological nitrogen fixation is an essential function of acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial communities. However, most acidophiles in AMD environments are uncultured microorganisms and little is known about the diversity of nitrogen-fixing genes and structure of nif gene cluster in AMD microbial communities. In this study, we used metagenomic sequencing to isolate nif genes in the AMD microbial community from Dexing Copper Mine, China. Meanwhile, a metagenome microarray containing 7,776 large-insertion fosmids was constructed to screen novel nif gene clusters. Metagenomic analyses revealed that 742 sequences were identified as nif genes including structural subunit genes nifH, nifD, nifK and various additional genes. The AMD community is massively dominated by the genus Acidithiobacillus. However, the phylogenetic diversity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms is much higher than previously thought in the AMD community. Furthermore, a 32.5-kb genomic sequence harboring nif, fix and associated genes was screened by metagenome microarray. Comparative genome analysis indicated that most nif genes in this cluster are most similar to those of Herbaspirillum seropedicae, but the organization of the nif gene cluster had significant differences from H. seropedicae. Sequence analysis and reverse transcription PCR also suggested that distinct transcription units of nif genes exist in this gene cluster. nifQ gene falls into the same transcription unit with fixABCX genes, which have not been reported in other diazotrophs before. All of these results indicated that more novel diazotrophs survive in the AMD community."
https://openalex.org/W2026061672,"Here, we report results from experiments designed to explore the association of the phenazinium dye safranin T (ST, 3,7-diamino-2,8-dimethyl-5-phenylphenazinium chloride) with single and double stranded form of polyriboadenylic acid (hereafter poly-A) using several spectroscopic techniques. We demonstrate that the dye binds to single stranded polyriboadenylic acid (hereafter ss poly-A) with high affinity while it does not interact at all with the double stranded (ds) form of the polynucleotide. Fluorescence and absorption spectral studies reveal the molecular aspects of binding of ST to single stranded form of the polynucleotide. This observation is also supported by the circular dichroism study. Thermodynamic data obtained from temperature dependence of binding constant reveals that association is driven by negative enthalpy change and opposed by negative entropy change. Ferrocyanide quenching studies have shown intercalative binding of ST to ss poly-A. Experiments on viscosity measurements confirm the binding mode of the dye to be intercalative. The effect of [Na+] ion concentration on the binding process suggests the role of electrostatic forces in the complexation.

CaM co-localizes and interacts with the HIV-1 Gag protein in the cytosol of infected cells. Although it has been shown that binding of Gag to CaM is mediated by the matrix (MA) domain, the structural details of this interaction are not known. We have recently shown that binding of CaM to MA induces a conformational change that triggers myristate exposure, and that the CaM-binding domain of MA is confined to a region spanning residues 8–43 (MA-(8–43)). Here, we present the NMR structure of CaM bound to MA-(8–43). Our data revealed that MA-(8–43), which contains a novel CaM-binding motif, binds to CaM in an antiparallel mode with the N-terminal helix (α1) anchored to the CaM C-terminal lobe, and the C-terminal helix (α2) of MA-(8–43) bound to the N-terminal lobe of CaM. The CaM protein preserves a semiextended conformation. Binding of MA-(8–43) to CaM is mediated by numerous hydrophobic interactions and stabilized by favorable electrostatic contacts. Our structural data are consistent with the findings that CaM induces unfolding of the MA protein to have access to helices α1 and α2. It is noteworthy that several MA residues involved in CaM binding have been previously implicated in membrane binding, envelope incorporation, and particle production.

Calmodulin's flexibility allows for promiscuity in its interactions with target proteins and peptides.Mol. Biotechnol. 2004; 27: 33-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CaM has a “dumbbell-like” architecture with the N- and C-terminal lobes connected by a flexible central linker, thus adopting a semiextended conformation. The central linker can adopt many different conformations allowing the N- and C-terminal lobes to wrap around target sequences in many different orientations. CaM-binding motifs typically consist of a region of ∼20 residues forming basic, often amphipathic helix. In many classical CaM-binding targets, hydrophobic residues involved in binding to CaM hydrophobic pockets, usually occupy conserved positions at 1-5-10 or 1-8-14 (30.Ishida H. Vogel H.J. Protein-peptide interaction studies demonstrate the versatility of calmodulin target protein binding.Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Additional basic residues are responsible for stabilization of the complex via electrostatic interactions with CaM acidic residues. Although these patterns are found in many CaM-binding proteins, unclassified motifs have also been identified (30.Ishida H. Vogel H.J. Protein-peptide interaction studies demonstrate the versatility of calmodulin target protein binding.Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2145862751,"Fructose consumption has been associated with the surge in obesity and dyslipidemia. This may be mediated by the fructose effects on hepatic lipids and ATP levels. Fructose metabolism provides carbons for de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and stimulates enterocyte secretion of apoB48. Thus, fructose-induced hepatic triglyceride (HTG) accumulation can be attributed to both DNL stimulation and dietary lipid absorption. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of fructose diet on HTG and ATP content and the contributions of dietary lipids and DNL to HTG. Measurements were performed in vivo in mice by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and novel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) approaches. Abdominal adipose tissue volume and intramyocellular lipid levels were comparable between 8-wk fructose- and glucose-fed mice. HTG levels were ~1.5-fold higher in fructose-fed than in glucose-fed mice (P<0.05). Metabolic flux analysis by 13C and 2H MRS showed that this was not due to dietary lipid absorption, but due to DNL stimulation. The contribution of oral lipids to HTG was, after 5 h, 1.60 ± 0.23% for fructose and 2.16 ± 0.35% for glucose diets (P=0.26), whereas that of DNL was higher in fructose than in glucose diets (2.55±0.51 vs. 1.13±0.24%, P=0.01). Hepatic energy status, assessed by P MRS, was similar for fructose- and glucose-fed mice. Fructose-induced HTG accumulation is better explained by DNL and not by dietary lipid uptake, while not compromising ATP homeostasis.—Nunes, P. M., Wright, A. J., Veltien, A., van Asten, J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2010955535,"Background Adult metabolic syndrome may in part have origins in fetal or early life. This study was designed to explore the effect of prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide and high-fat diet on metabolic syndrome in offspring rats. Methods 32 pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups, including Control group; LPS group (pregnant rats were injected with LPS 0.4 mg/kg intraperitoneally on the 8th, 10th and 12th day of pregnancy); High-fat group (maternal rats had high-fat diet during pregnancy and lactation period, and their pups also had high-fat diet up to the third month of life); LPS + High-fat group (rats were exposed to the identical experimental scheme with LPS group and High-fat group). Results Blood pressure elevated in LPS group and High-fat group, reduced in LPS+High-fat group, accompanied by the increase of serum leptin level in LPS and High-fat group and increase of serum IL-6, TNF-a in High-fat group; both serum insulin and cholesterol increased in High-fat and LPS+High-fat group, as well as insulin in LPS group. HOMA-IR value increased in LPS, High-fat and LPS+High-fat group, and QUICKI decreased in these groups; H-E staining showed morphologically pathological changes in thoracic aorta and liver tissue in the three groups. Increased serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase suggest impaired liver function in LPS+High-fat group. Conclusion/Significance Prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide combined with pre- and postnatal high-fat diet result in lowered blood pressure, insulin resistance and impaired liver function in three-month old offspring rats. The lowered blood pressure might benefit from the predictive adaptive response to prenatal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1999698328,"Hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy is an autosomal dominant disorder in which a variant form of cystatin C (L68Q) readily forms amyloid deposits in cerebral arteries in affected individuals resulting in early death. L68Q protein deposits in human cystatin C amyloid angiopathy patients have also been found in tissues outside of the brain including the testis, suggesting possible effects on fertility. Heterozygous transgenic mice (L68Q) that express the human L68Q variant of cystatin C under the control of the mouse cystatin C promoter were unable to generate offspring, suggesting the presence of L68Q cystatin C amyloid affected sperm function. In vitro studies showed that epididymal spermatozoa from L68Q mice were unable to fertilize oocytes and exhibited poor sperm motility. Furthermore, spermatozoa from L68Q mice exhibited reduced cell viability compared with wild type (WT) spermatozoa and often were detected in large agglutinated clumps. Examination of the epididymal fluid and spermatozoa from L68Q mice showed increased levels and distinct forms of cystatin C amyloid that were not present in WT mice. The addition of epididymal fluid from L68Q mice to WT spermatozoa resulted in a recapitulation of the L68Q phenotype in that WT spermatozoa showed reduced cell viability and motility compared with WT spermatozoa incubated in epididymal fluid from WT mice. L68Q epididymal fluid that was depleted of cystatin C amyloids, however, did not impair the motility of WT spermatozoa. Taken together these studies suggest that amyloids in the epididymal fluid can be cytotoxic to the maturing spermatozoa resulting in male infertility."
https://openalex.org/W2039460300,"Although traditional mutation is still an attractive approach for strain improvement, it is tedious, time-consuming, and inefficient to screen for surfactin producing strains. To overcome this, we developed a high-throughput screening method for surfactin producing mutants by applying polydiacetylene (PDA) vesicles as sensors with visible chromatic change from blue to red, detected as colorimetric response (CR%) signal, which can even semi-quantify the yields of surfactin. Bacillus subtilis 723 was used as parent strain and multiply mutated with atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP). Mutants were cultured in MicroFlask by Duetz (24 square deepwell plates, Applikon Biotechnology) and surfactin titers were tested in 96-well plates with PDA vesicles. Mutants with surfactin titers above150 mg/L (CR% value above 26%) were selected as high-yield strains and further quantified by HPLC. By integrating MicroFlask cultivation and the PDA vesicles detection, we screened 27,000 mutants and found 37 high-yield strains. From these, one mutant produced 473.6 mg/L surfactin (including 353.1 mg/L C15 surfactin), which was 5.4-fold than that of the parent strain. This method is efficient, cost-effective and provides wider application in screening for various surfactants."
https://openalex.org/W2017747869,"We have previously shown that Jak3 is involved in the signaling pathways of CCR7, CCR9 and CXCR4 in murine T lymphocytes and that Jak3⁻/⁻ lymphocytes display an intrinsic defect in homing to peripheral lymph nodes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the defective migration observed in Jak3⁻/⁻ lymphocytes remains elusive. Here, it is demonstrated for the first time, that Jak3 is required for the actin cytoskeleton reorganization in T lymphocytes responding to chemokines. It was found that Jak3 regulates actin polymerization by controlling cofilin inactivation in response to CCL21 and CXCL12. Interestingly, cofilin inactivation was not precluded in PTX- treated cells despite their impaired actin polymerization. Additionally, Jak3 was required for small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA activation, which are indispensable for acquisition of the migratory cell phenotype and the generation of a functional leading edge and uropod, respectively. This defect correlates with data obtained by time-lapse video-microscopy showing an incompetent uropod formation and impaired motility in Jak3-pharmacologically inhibited T lymphocytes. Our data support a new model in which Jak3 and heterotrimeric G proteins can use independent, but complementary, signaling pathways to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics during cell migration in response to chemokines."
https://openalex.org/W2017818190,"Streptococcus agalactiae, long recognized as a mammalian pathogen, is an emerging concern with regard to fish. In this study, we used a mouse model and in vitro cell infection to evaluate the pathogenetic characteristics of S. agalactiae GD201008-001, isolated from tilapia in China. This bacterium was found to be highly virulent and capable of inducing brain damage by migrating into the brain by crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The phagocytosis assays indicated that this bacterium could be internalized by murine macrophages and survive intracellularly for more than 24 h, inducing injury to macrophages. Further, selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) was used to investigate microbial gene expression associated with intracellular survival. This positive cDNA selection technique identified 60 distinct genes that could be characterized into 6 functional categories. More than 50% of the differentially expressed genes were involved in metabolic adaptation. Some genes have previously been described as associated with virulence in other bacteria, and four showed no significant similarities to any other previously described genes. This study constitutes the first step in further gene expression analyses that will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms used by S. agalactiae to survive in macrophages and to cross the BBB."
https://openalex.org/W2062745079,"Although the two ciliopathies Bardet-Biedl syndrome and nephronophthisis share multiple clinical manifestations, the molecular basis for this overlap remains largely unknown. Both BBS11 and NPHP7 are unusual members of their respective gene families. Although BBS11/TRIM32 represents a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase also involved in hereditary forms of muscular dystrophy, NPHP7/Glis2 is a Gli-like transcriptional repressor that localizes to the nucleus, deviating from the ciliary localization of most other ciliopathy-associated gene products. We found that BBS11/TRIM32 and NPHP7/Glis2 can physically interact with each other, suggesting that both proteins form a functionally relevant protein complex in vivo. This hypothesis was further supported by the genetic interaction and synergist cyst formation in the zebrafish pronephros model. However, contrary to our expectation, the E3 ubiquitin ligase BBS11/TRIM32 was not responsible for the short half-life of NPHP7/Glis2 but instead promoted the accumulation of mixed Lys(48)/Lys(63)-polyubiquitylated NPHP7/Glis2 species. This modification not only prolonged the half-life of NPHP7/Glis2, but also altered the subnuclear localization and the transcriptional activity of NPHP7/Glis2. Thus, physical and functional interactions between NPHP and Bardet-Biedl syndrome gene products, demonstrated for Glis2 and TRIM32, may help to explain the phenotypic similarities between these two syndromes."

As the only protein identified so far that interacts directly with DRM2, RDM1 plays a pivotal role in the RdDM mechanism by linking the de novo DNA methyltransferase activity to AGO4, which binds short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that presumably base-pair with Pol II or Pol V scaffold transcripts synthesized at target loci. RDM1 also acts together with the chromatin remodeler DEFECTIVE IN RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION1 (DRD1) and the structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes solo hinge protein DEFECTIVE IN MERISTEM SILENCING3 (DMS3) to form the DDR complex, which facilitates synthesis of Pol V scaffold transcripts. The manner in which RDM1 acts in both the DDR complex and as a factor bridging DRM2 and AGO4 remains unclear. RDM1 contains no known protein domains but a prior structural analysis suggested distinct regions that create a hydrophobic pocket and promote homodimer formation, respectively. We have tested several mutated forms of RDM1 altered in the predicted pocket and dimerization regions for their ability to complement defects in RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing, support synthesis of Pol V transcripts, form homodimers, and interact with DMS3. Our results indicate that the ability to form homodimers is essential for RDM1 to function fully in the RdDM pathway and may be particularly important during the de novo methylation step."
https://openalex.org/W2143906239,"Contextual cues are known to benefit memory retrieval, but whether and how sleep affects this context effect remains unresolved. We manipulated contextual congruence during memory retrieval in human volunteers across 12 h and 24 h intervals beginning with either sleep or wakefulness. Our data suggest that whereas contextual cues lose their potency with time, sleep does not modulate this process. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the idea that sleep's beneficial effect on memory retention depends on the amount of waking time that has passed between encoding and sleep onset. The findings are discussed in the framework of competitive consolidation theory."
https://openalex.org/W1990957626,"The liver is the first line of defense from environmental stressors in that hepatocytes respond to and metabolize them. Hence, hepatocytes can be damaged by stressors. Protection against hepatic cell damage and cell death is important for liver function and homeostasis. TAK1 (MAP3K7) is an intermediate of stressors such as bacterial moieties–induced signal transduction pathways in several cell types. Tak1 deficiency has been reported to induce spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the regulatory mechanism of TAK1 activity in liver stress response has not yet been defined. Here we report that activation of TAK1 through TAK1 binding protein 2 (TAB2) is required for liver protection from stressors. We found that a bacterial moiety, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), activated TAK1 in primary hepatocytes, which was diminished by deletion of TAB2. Mice having hepatocyte-specific deletion of the Tab2 gene exhibited only late-onset moderate liver lesions but were hypersensitive to LPS-induced liver injury. Furthermore, we show that a chemical stressor induced greatly exaggerated liver injury in hepatocyte-specific Tab2-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that TAB2 is a sensor of stress conditions in the liver and functions to protect the liver by activating the TAK1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2083014311,"Background Cercopithifilaria bainae is a filarioid parasite that infects dogs, being transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus group ticks in many countries of the Mediterranean basin. This study assessed the incidence density rate (IDR) of infection by C. bainae in dogs and the probability of co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens (i.e., Anaplasma platys, Babesia vogeli and Hepatozoon canis), in an area of high endemicity in southern Italy. Methodology/Principal Findings From March 2011 to October 2012, a field study involving 58 young dogs naturally exposed to tick infestation was conducted. Skin and blood samples obtained from each dog six times during an 18-month period were tested for C. bainae by parasite detection within skin snip sediments, with subsequent confirmation through PCR and DNA sequencing. Dogs examined monthly for ticks and A. platys, B. vogeli and H. canis were microscopically and/or molecularly diagnosed and after the first and the second summer seasons, the IDR for positive animal-month at risk was 3.8% and 1.7% in November 2011 and October 2012, respectively. All 58 C. bainae-infected dogs were simultaneously infected with at least one other tick-borne pathogen. After the first summer season (assessment in November 2011), a C. bainae-infected dog had a 33% probability of being infected with H. canis or A. platys, whereas after the second tick season (assessment in October 2012) the probability of co-infection was 78%, 22% and 11% for H. canis, A. platys and B. vogeli, respectively. Conclusions Our data indicate that tick-infested dogs are at risk of acquiring infection by C. bainae. In addition, the detection of C. bainae microfilariae indicates a prior tick exposure and, should stimulate testing for other tick-borne disease causing pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2091338378,"Multicellular animals possess two to three different types of muscle tissues. Striated muscles have considerable ultrastructural similarity and contain a core set of proteins including the muscle myosin heavy chain (Mhc) protein. The ATPase activity of this myosin motor protein largely dictates muscle performance at the molecular level. Two different solutions to adjusting myosin properties to different muscle subtypes have been identified so far: Vertebrates and nematodes contain many independent differentially expressed Mhc genes while arthropods have single Mhc genes with clusters of mutually exclusive spliced exons (MXEs). The availability of hundreds of metazoan genomes now allowed us to study whether the ancient bilateria already contained MXEs, how MXE complexity subsequently evolved, and whether additional scenarios to control contractile properties in different muscles could be proposed, By reconstructing the Mhc genes from 116 metazoans we showed that all intron positions within the motor domain coding regions are conserved in all bilateria analysed. The last common ancestor of the bilateria already contained a cluster of MXEs coding for part of the loop-2 actin-binding sequence. Subsequently the protostomes and later the arthropods gained many further clusters while MXEs got completely lost independently in several branches (vertebrates and nematodes) and species (for example the annelid Helobdella robusta and the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis). Several bilateria have been found to encode multiple Mhc genes that might all or in part contain clusters of MXEs. Notable examples are a cluster of six tandemly arrayed Mhc genes, of which two contain MXEs, in the owl limpet Lottia gigantea and four Mhc genes with three encoding MXEs in the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis. Our analysis showed that similar solutions to provide different myosin isoforms (multiple genes or clusters of MXEs or both) have independently been developed several times within bilaterian evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2104662161,"Bacterial polysaccharides have numerous clinical or industrial uses. Recombinant plants could offer the possibility of producing bacterial polysaccharides on a large scale and free of contaminating bacterial toxins and antigens. We investigated the feasibility of this proposal by cloning and expressing the gene for the type 3 synthase (cps3S) of Streptococcus pneumoniae in Nicotinia tabacum, using the pCambia2301 vector and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. In planta the recombinant synthase polymerised plant-derived UDP-glucose and UDP-glucuronic acid to form type 3 polysaccharide. Expression of the cps3S gene was detected by RT-PCR and production of the pneumococcal polysaccharide was detected in tobacco leaf extracts by double immunodiffusion, Western blotting and high-voltage paper electrophoresis. Because it is used a component of anti-pneumococcal vaccines, the immunogenicity of the plant-derived type 3 polysaccharide was tested. Mice immunised with extracts from recombinant plants were protected from challenge with a lethal dose of pneumococci in a model of pneumonia and the immunised mice had significantly elevated levels of serum anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies. This study provides the proof of the principle that bacterial polysaccharide can be successfully synthesised in plants and that these recombinant polysaccharides could be used as vaccines to protect against life-threatening infections."
https://openalex.org/W2140925635,"Novel relaxants of pulmonary arteries and airways are of special interest to obtain insights into pulmonary signaling pathways and to develop treatment strategies for lung diseases. Herein, we demonstrate that Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides induce a dose-dependent relaxation of pulmonary arteries and airways in mouse. The relaxing effect was specific because it was strongly reduced using the control peptides RGE or RAD (P<0.001). Longer peptide sequences containing RGD and its flanking amino acids found in fibronectin showed a similar effect even at a 10-fold lower concentration. The relevance of RGD-induced pulmonary vasorelaxation was demonstrated in isometric force measurements, lung slices, and the isolated perfused lung model under normoxia and hypoxia and in vivo. As cell surface receptor we identified β3- but not β1-integrin subunits. Moreover, vasorelaxation by RGD peptides was strongly diminished after removal of the endothelium in endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient (eNOS-/- mice; P<0.01) and after pharmacological inhibition of the NO/sGC pathway (P<0.05). Additionally, several potassium channels like Kv, Kir, and KATP played a role. In airways the response was mediated by Kv and KCa channels. Thus, RGD peptides are relaxants of pulmonary arteries and airways. These findings may help to establish novel therapeutic approaches for pulmonary hypertension and obstructive lung disease.—Welschoff, J., Matthey, M., Wenzel, D.
