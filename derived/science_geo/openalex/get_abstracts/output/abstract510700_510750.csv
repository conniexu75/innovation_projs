https://openalex.org/W1975749505,"We present the high-quality genome sequence of a ∼45,000-year-old modern human male from Siberia. This individual derives from a population that lived before—or simultaneously with—the separation of the populations in western and eastern Eurasia and carries a similar amount of Neanderthal ancestry as present-day Eurasians. However, the genomic segments of Neanderthal ancestry are substantially longer than those observed in present-day individuals, indicating that Neanderthal gene flow into the ancestors of this individual occurred 7,000–13,000 years before he lived. We estimate an autosomal mutation rate of 0.4 × 10−9 to 0.6 × 10−9 per site per year, a Y chromosomal mutation rate of 0.7 × 10−9 to 0.9 × 10−9 per site per year based on the additional substitutions that have occurred in present-day non-Africans compared to this genome, and a mitochondrial mutation rate of 1.8 × 10−8 to 3.2 × 10−8 per site per year based on the age of the bone. The high-quality genome sequence of a 45,000-year-old modern human from Siberia reveals that gene flow from Neanderthals into the ancestors of this individual had already occurred about 7,000 to 13,000 years earlier; genomic comparisons show that he belonged to a population that lived close in time to the separation of populations in east and west Eurasia and that may represent an early modern human radiation out of Africa that has no direct descendants today. A modern human fossil femur found in 2008 on the banks of the river Irtysh near Ust'-Ishim in western Siberia was dated at about 45,000 years old. Janet Kelso and colleagues have now sequenced and analysed the genome from this individual — a male who was alive before, or at about the time of, the separation of the populations in western and eastern Eurasia. Analyses reveal a level of Neanderthal ancestry similar to that found in present-day Eurasians. Based on the length of the genomic segments of Neanderthal ancestry, the flow of Neanderthal genes into the ancestors of this individual occurred between 7,000 and 13,000 years before he lived. Previous estimates of the timing of interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals range from 37,000 and 86,000 years ago, but this study suggests that it occurred approximately 50,000 to 60,000 years ago, coinciding with the expansion of modern humans into Europe, and possibly Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2092102399,"The molecular structure of the electrical double layer determines the chemistry in all electrochemical processes. Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we probed the structure of water near gold electrodes and its bias dependence. Electron yield XAS detected at the gold electrode revealed that the interfacial water molecules have a different structure from those in the bulk. First principles calculations revealed that ~50% of the molecules lie flat on the surface with saturated hydrogen bonds and another substantial fraction with broken hydrogen bonds that do not contribute to the XAS spectrum because their core-excited states are delocalized by coupling with the gold substrate. At negative bias, the population of flat-lying molecules with broken hydrogen bonds increases, producing a spectrum similar to that of bulk water."
https://openalex.org/W1997134228,"Permafrost contains about 50% of the global soil carbon. It is thought that the thawing of permafrost can lead to a loss of soil carbon in the form of methane and carbon dioxide emissions. The magnitude of the resulting positive climate feedback of such greenhouse gas emissions is still unknown and may to a large extent depend on the poorly understood role of microbial community composition in regulating the metabolic processes that drive such ecosystem-scale greenhouse gas fluxes. Here we show that changes in vegetation and increasing methane emissions with permafrost thaw are associated with a switch from hydrogenotrophic to partly acetoclastic methanogenesis, resulting in a large shift in the δ(13)C signature (10-15‰) of emitted methane. We used a natural landscape gradient of permafrost thaw in northern Sweden as a model to investigate the role of microbial communities in regulating methane cycling, and to test whether a knowledge of community dynamics could improve predictions of carbon emissions under loss of permafrost. Abundance of the methanogen Candidatus 'Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis' is a key predictor of the shifts in methane isotopes, which in turn predicts the proportions of carbon emitted as methane and as carbon dioxide, an important factor for simulating the climate feedback associated with permafrost thaw in global models. By showing that the abundance of key microbial lineages can be used to predict atmospherically relevant patterns in methane isotopes and the proportion of carbon metabolized to methane during permafrost thaw, we establish a basis for scaling changing microbial communities to ecosystem isotope dynamics. Our findings indicate that microbial ecology may be important in ecosystem-scale responses to global change."

Brain tissue studies suggested that insulin resistance is caused by low insulin receptor signaling attributable to its abnormal association with more phospho (P)-serine-type 1 insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) and less P-tyrosine-IRS-1. Plasma exosomes enriched for neural sources by immunoabsorption were obtained once from 26 patients with AD, 20 patients with DM2, 16 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and matched case control subjects. At 2 time points, they were obtained from 22 others when cognitively normal and 1 to 10 yr later when diagnosed with AD. Mean exosomal levels of extracted P-serine 312-IRS-1 and P-pan-tyrosine-IRS-1 by ELISA and the ratio of P-serine 312-IRS-1 to P-pan-tyrosine-IRS-1 (insulin resistance factor, R) for AD and DM2 and P-serine 312-IRS-1 and R for FTD were significantly different from those for case control subjects. The levels of R for AD were significandy higher than those for DM2 or FTD. Stepwise discriminant modeling showed correct classification of 100% of patients with AD, 97.5% of patients with DM2, and 84% of patients with FTD. In longitudinal studies of 22 patients with AD, exosomal levels of P-serine 312-IRS-1, P-pan-tyrosine-IRS-1, and R were significantly different 1 to 10 yr before and at the time of diagnosis compared with control subjects. Insulin resistance reflected in R values from this blood test is higher for patients with AD, DM2, and FTD than case control subjects; higher for patients with AD than patients with DM2 or FTD; and accurately predicts development of AD up to 10 yr prior to clinical onset.—Kapogiannis, D., Boxer, A., Schwartz, J.

https://openalex.org/W1980934196,"After immunogenic challenge, infiltrating and dividing lymphocytes markedly increase lymph node cellularity, leading to organ expansion. Here we report that the physical elasticity of lymph nodes is maintained in part by podoplanin (PDPN) signalling in stromal fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) and its modulation by CLEC-2 expressed on dendritic cells. We show in mouse cells that PDPN induces actomyosin contractility in FRCs via activation of RhoA/C and downstream Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Engagement by CLEC-2 causes PDPN clustering and rapidly uncouples PDPN from RhoA/C activation, relaxing the actomyosin cytoskeleton and permitting FRC stretching. Notably, administration of CLEC-2 protein to immunized mice augments lymph node expansion. In contrast, lymph node expansion is significantly constrained in mice selectively lacking CLEC-2 expression in dendritic cells. Thus, the same dendritic cells that initiate immunity by presenting antigens to T lymphocytes also initiate remodelling of lymph nodes by delivering CLEC-2 to FRCs. CLEC-2 modulation of PDPN signalling permits FRC network stretching and allows for the rapid lymph node expansion--driven by lymphocyte influx and proliferation--that is the critical hallmark of adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2064612269,"Insulin resistance may be linked to incomplete fatty acid β-oxidation and the subsequent increase in acylcarnitine species in different tissues including skeletal muscle. It is not known if acylcarnitines participate in muscle insulin resistance or simply reflect dysregulated metabolism. The aims of this study were to determine whether acylcarnitines can elicit muscle insulin resistance and to better understand the link between incomplete muscle fatty acid β-oxidation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin-resistance development. Differentiated C2C12, primary mouse, and human myotubes were treated with acylcarnitines (C4:0, C14:0, C16:0) or with palmitate with or without carnitine acyltransferase inhibition by mildronate. Treatment with C4:0, C14:0, and C16:0 acylcarnitines resulted in 20-30% decrease in insulin response at the level of Akt phosphorylation and/or glucose uptake. Mildronate reversed palmitate-induced insulin resistance concomitant with an ∼25% decrease in short-chain acylcarnitine and acetylcarnitine secretion. Although proinflammatory cytokines were not affected under these conditions, oxidative stress was increased by 2-3 times by short- or long-chain acylcarnitines. Acylcarnitine-induced oxidative stress and insulin resistance were reversed by treatment with antioxidants. Results are consistent with the conclusion that incomplete muscle fatty acid β-oxidation causes acylcarnitine accumulation and associated oxidative stress, raising the possibility that these metabolites play a role in muscle insulin resistance."

This repertoire represents a rich and inexhaustible source for antibiotics and fungicides. Antimicrobial peptides are an emerging class of fungal defense molecules that are promising candidates for pharmaceutical applications. Based on a co-cultivation system, we studied the interaction of the coprophilous basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea with different bacterial species and identified a novel defensin, copsin. The polypeptide was recombinantly produced in Pichia pastoris, and the three-dimensional structure was solved by NMR. The cysteine stabilized α/β-fold with a unique disulfide connectivity, and an N-terminal pyroglutamate rendered copsin extremely stable against high temperatures and protease digestion. Copsin was bactericidal against a diversity of Gram-positive bacteria, including human pathogens such as Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes. Characterization of the antibacterial activity revealed that copsin bound specifically to the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II and therefore interfered with the cell wall biosynthesis. In particular, and unlike lantibiotics and other defensins, the third position of the lipid II pentapeptide is essential for effective copsin binding. The unique structural properties of copsin make it a possible scaffold for new antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2029341317,"Stimulation of endothelial cells (ECs) with TNF-α causes an increase in the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and the production of endothelial microparticles (EMPs). BMP-2 is known to produce osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). It was found that EMPs from TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells (HUVECs) contained a significant amount of BMP-2 and were able to enhance VSMC osteogenesis and calcification. Calcium content was greater in VSMCs exposed to EMPs from TNF-α-treated HUVECs than EMPs from nontreated HUVECs (3.56 ± 0.57 vs. 1.48 ± 0.56 µg/mg protein; P < 0.05). The increase in calcification was accompanied by up-regulation of Cbfa1 (osteogenic transcription factor) and down-regulation of SM22α (VSMC lineage marker). Inhibition of BMP-2 by small interfering RNA reduced the VSMC calcification induced by EMPs from TNF-α-treated HUVECs. Similar osteogenic capability was observed in EMPs from both patients with chronic kidney disease and senescent cells, which also presented a high level of BMP-2 expression. Labeling of EMPs with CellTracker shows that EMPs are phagocytized by VSMCs under all conditions (with or without high phosphate, control, and EMPs from TNF-α-treated HUVECs). Our data suggest that EC damage results in the release of EMPs with a high content of calcium and BMP-2 that are able to induce calcification and osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs."

However, despite the prominent presence of aeroterrestrial algae in terrestrial habitats, hardly anything is known about the molecular events that allow aeroterrestrial algae to survive harsh environmental conditions. We analyzed the transcriptome and physiology of a strain of the alpine aeroterrestrial alga Klebsormidium crenulatum under control and strong desiccation-stress conditions.For comparison we first established a reference transcriptome. The high-coverage reference transcriptome includes about 24,183 sequences (1.5 million reads, 636 million bases). The reference transcriptome encodes for all major pathways (energy, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, sugars), nearly all deduced pathways are complete or missing only a few transcripts. Upon strong desiccation, more than 7000 transcripts showed changes in their expression levels. Most of the highest up-regulated transcripts do not show similarity to known viridiplant proteins, suggesting the existence of some genus- or species-specific responses to desiccation. In addition, we observed the up-regulation of many transcripts involved in desiccation tolerance in plants (e.g. proteins similar to those that are abundant in late embryogenesis (LEA), or proteins involved in early response to desiccation ERD), and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFO) known to act as osmolytes). Major physiological shifts are the up-regulation of transcripts for photosynthesis, energy production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, which is supported by elevated cellular glutathione content as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy as well as an increase in total antiradical power. However, the effective quantum yield of Photosystem II and CO2 fixation decreased sharply under the applied desiccation stress. In contrast, transcripts for cell integrative functions such as cell division, DNA replication, cofactor biosynthesis, and amino acid biosynthesis were down-regulated.This is the first study investigating the desiccation transcriptome of a streptophyte green alga. Our results indicate that the cellular response is similar to embryophytes, suggesting that embryophytes inherited a basic cellular desiccation tolerance from their streptophyte predecessors."
https://openalex.org/W2143353752,"Dysregulation of thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine (T3/T4) can impact metabolism, body composition, and development. Thus, it is critical to identify novel mechanisms that impact T3/T4 production. We found that type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs), which are activated by bitter-tasting compounds such as those found in many foods and pharmaceuticals, negatively regulate thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-dependent Ca2+ increases and TSH-dependent iodide efflux in thyrocytes. Immunohistochemical Tas2r-dependent reporter expression and real-time PCR analyses reveal that human and mouse thyrocytes and the Nthy-Ori 3-1 human thyrocyte line express several TAS2Rs. Five different agonists for thyrocyte-expressed TAS2Rs reduced TSH-dependent Ca2+ release in Nthy-Ori 3-1 cells, but not basal Ca2+ levels, in a dose-dependent manner. Ca2+ responses were unaffected by 6-n-propylthiouracil, consistent with the expression of an unresponsive variant of its cognate receptor, TAS2R38, in these cells. TAS2R agonists also inhibited basal and TSH-dependent iodide efflux. Furthermore, a common TAS2R42 polymorphism is associated with increased serum T4 levels in a human cohort. Our findings indicate that TAS2Rs couple the detection of bitter-tasting compounds to changes in thyrocyte function and T3/T4 production. Thus, TAS2Rs may mediate a protective response to overingestion of toxic materials and could serve as new druggable targets for therapeutic treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism.—Clark, A.

https://openalex.org/W2010105936,"Store-operated Ca(2+) entry, essential for the adaptive immunity, is initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) sensor STIM1. Ca(2+) entry occurs through the plasma membrane resident Ca(2+) channel Orai1 that directly interacts with the C-terminal STIM1 domain, named SOAR/CAD. Depletion of the ER Ca(2+) store controls this STIM1/Orai1 interaction via transition to an extended STIM1 C-terminal conformation, exposure of the SOAR/CAD domain, and STIM1/Orai1 co-clustering. Here we developed a novel approach termed FRET-derived Interaction in a Restricted Environment (FIRE) in an attempt to dissect the interplay of coiled-coil (CC) interactions in controlling STIM1 quiescent as well as active conformation and cluster formation. We present evidence of a sequential activation mechanism in the STIM1 cytosolic domains where the interaction between CC1 and CC3 segment regulates both SOAR/CAD exposure and CC3-mediated higher-order oligomerization as well as cluster formation. These dual levels of STIM1 auto-inhibition provide efficient control over the coupling to and activation of Orai1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2042840948,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a highly regulated cellular process that mediates the degradation of a selective subset of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes. Increasing CMA activity is one way for a cell to respond to stress, and it leads to enhanced turnover of non-critical cytosolic proteins into sources of energy or clearance of unwanted or damaged proteins from the cytosol. The lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (LAMP-2A) together with a complex of chaperones and co-chaperones are key regulators of CMA. LAMP-2A is a transmembrane protein component for protein translocation to the lysosome. Here we present a study of the structure and dynamics of the transmembrane domain of human LAMP-2A in n-dodecylphosphocholine micelles by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We showed that LAMP-2A exists as a homotrimer in which the membrane-spanning helices wrap around each other to form a parallel coiled coil conformation, whereas its cytosolic tail is flexible and exposed to the cytosol. This cytosolic tail of LAMP-2A interacts with chaperone Hsc70 and a CMA substrate RNase A with comparable affinity but not with Hsp40 and RNase S peptide. Because the substrates and the chaperone complex can bind at the same time, thus creating a bimodal interaction, we propose that substrate recognition by chaperones and targeting to the lysosomal membrane by LAMP-2A are coupled. This can increase substrate affinity and specificity as well as prevent substrate aggregation, assist in the unfolding of the substrate, and promote the formation of the higher order complex of LAMP-2A required for translocation.

In the CMA process, cytosolic proteins are recruited from the cytosol to the lysosomal membrane and translocated one by one across the membrane into the lumen for degradation (5.Dice J.F.

A molecular chaperone complex at the lysosomal membrane is required for protein translocation.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation of these proteins across the lysosomal membrane is established by a glycosylated membrane protein, LAMP-2 (47.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F.

The protein LAMP-2 resides in the lysosome and is an integral membrane protein with two conserved luminal domains (constituting 90% of the entire protein), a single transmembrane (TM) domain (about 20 amino acids), and a short (10–12-amino acid) C-terminal cytosolic tail (48.Gough N.R. Hatem C.L. Fambrough D.M. The family of LAMP-2 proteins arises by alternative splicing from a single gene: characterization of the avian LAMP-2 gene and identification of mammalian homologs of LAMP-2b and LAMP-2c.DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 49.Hatem C.L.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2093-2100PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation is only found in its luminal domains. The most studied LAMP-2A is found to be present in CMA complexes extracted from different tissues during CMA activation (50.Konecki D.S. Foetisch K. Zimmer K.P. Schlotter M. Lichter-Konecki U.

Commun. 1995; 215: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition to Hsc70, other co-chaperones are involved together with LAMP-2A to mediate translocation of CMA substrates across the lysosomal membrane (46.Agarraberes F.A. Dice J.F. A molecular chaperone complex at the lysosomal membrane is required for protein translocation.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequestration of these components by their specific antibodies inhibits CMA activity (47.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F.

Unique properties of lamp2a compared to other lamp2 isoforms.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies have also shown that LAMP-2A exists as a homomultimer, which upon CMA activation forms a higher oligomer complex with the chaperones (51.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Unique properties of lamp2a compared to other lamp2 isoforms.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of this higher oligomer is required for the translocation of substrates across the lysosomal membrane (51.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Unique properties of lamp2a compared to other lamp2 isoforms.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Bandyopadhyay U. Kaushik S. Varticovski L. Cuervo A.M. The chaperone-mediated autophagy receptor organizes in dynamic protein complexes at the lysosomal membrane.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5747-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). An increase in the CMA activity is directly related to the number of LAMP-2A proteins present in the lysosomal membrane (52.Bandyopadhyay U. Kaushik S. Varticovski L. Cuervo A.M. The chaperone-mediated autophagy receptor organizes in dynamic protein complexes at the lysosomal membrane.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5747-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The accumulation of LAMP-2A in the lysosomal membrane is a result of reduction in its degradation rate or an increase in its transcription (53.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Regulation of lamp2a levels in the lysosomal membrane.Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The CMA process is specific and regulated by tightly linked steps: recognition of CMA substrates in the cytosol, recruitment of substrates from cytosol to lysosomal outer membrane, and translocation of substrates across the membrane (52.Bandyopadhyay U. Kaushik S. Varticovski L. Cuervo A.M. The chaperone-mediated autophagy receptor organizes in dynamic protein complexes at the lysosomal membrane.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5747-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the specificity of this process comes entirely from the recognition step involving Hsc70 or the recruitment and translocation steps involving LAMP-2A. It has been presumed that only the cytosolic tail of LAMP-2A is accessible by the substrate and chaperones in the cytosol. In fact, it has been shown that mutations in the cytosolic tail of LAMP-2A can diminish the CMA activity by reducing substrate binding affinity (51.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Unique properties of lamp2a compared to other lamp2 isoforms.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, studies of substrates binding to reconstituted isolated lysosomes containing LAMP-2A showed specificity in substrate recruitment (52.Bandyopadhyay U. Kaushik S. Varticovski L. Cuervo A.M. The chaperone-mediated autophagy receptor organizes in dynamic protein complexes at the lysosomal membrane.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5747-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The above observations would suggest two tiers of selection of substrate: first at the recognition step in the cytosol involving Hsc70 and then at the recruitment step by the cytosolic tail of LAMP-2A. It is also important to note that some population of chaperones and co-chaperones can also be found in the lysosomal membrane that might assist in the substrate recruitment process (46.Agarraberes F.A. Dice J.F. A molecular chaperone complex at the lysosomal membrane is required for protein translocation.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactive LAMP-2A exists as a homomultimer (51.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Unique properties of lamp2a compared to other lamp2 isoforms.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Bandyopadhyay U. Kaushik S. Varticovski L. Cuervo A.M. The chaperone-mediated autophagy receptor organizes in dynamic protein complexes at the lysosomal membrane.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5747-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It is not clear what the conformation of this multimer is and whether it has a role in recruitment of substrates. Upon CMA activation, the number of LAMP-2A monomers in the CMA complex increases, and there is an additional presence of chaperones and co-chaperones. In this stage, substrate can no longer bind to LAMP-2A (52.Bandyopadhyay U. Kaushik S. Varticovski L. Cuervo A.M. The chaperone-mediated autophagy receptor organizes in dynamic protein complexes at the lysosomal membrane.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5747-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The cause of the formation of this high oligomer complex, which is required for translocation, is not known. One possibility is that the interaction of substrate or chaperone with inactive LAMP-2A cytosolic tail can trigger aggregation through its transmembrane domain. Alternatively, the tail interaction may promote aggregation through its luminal domains. This presumes that information about substrate interaction on its cytosolic side can be transmitted to the luminal side of the LAMP-2A. Addressing some of these outstanding questions in molecular detail is necessary to understand this complex and important cellular process. We addressed the above questions by studying the structure of a LAMP-2A protein construct containing its TM domain along with its cytosolic tail and a short (6-residue) luminal segment in a membrane mimic, DPC micelles, using NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical methods. Our data showed that the TM domain of LAMP-2A monomer has an extended α-helical conformation with a flexible cytosolic tail. Three TM monomers interact tightly in the micelle to form a coiled coil trimer. The flexible LAMP-2A cytosolic tail interacts with chaperone Hsc70 and a CMA substrate, RNase A, with comparable affinity but does not interact with a co-chaperone, Hsp40, or an RNase S peptide. No changes in the NMR chemical shifts of the transmembrane or luminal residues were detected upon cytosolic tail binding to either Hsc70 or RNase A. Thus, our study suggests that inactive LAMP-2A assembles across the lysosomal membrane as a trimer. The cytosolic tail of LAMP-2A in the multimer can bind both chaperone Hsc70 and substrate protein simultaneously. These findings parallel those of other cellular transport machineries (such as mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum transport) where chaperones are recruited together with substrates by the membrane transporter to avoid substrate aggregation that can inhibit translocation (54.Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Pathways of chaperone-mediated protein folding in the cytosol.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 55.Ellis R.J. Molecular chaperones: Plugging the transport gap.Nature. 2003; 421: 801-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Binding of the cytosolic tail of LAMP-2A did not induce any conformational changes in its TM domain or its short luminal segment, which suggests that higher CMA oligomer complex formation is triggered primarily by interaction of LAMP-2A with its cytosolic CMA components independently of its TM and luminal domains. The LAMP-2A gene from Homo sapiens (human, P13473) was synthesized and codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli (Bio Basic Inc.) (56.Konecki D.S. Foetisch K. Schlotter M. Lichter-Konecki U. Complete cDNA sequence of human lysosome-associated membrane protein-2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A LAMP-2A construct containing the TM domain and C-terminal cytosolic tail (amino acids 369–410 and referred to as TM-LAMP-2A) was designed, cloned into pMAL2px vector (New England Biolabs), and expressed as a maltose-binding protein fusion protein along with a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Isotopically (15N- or 13C/15N-) labeled proteins were produced in isotope-enriched M9 minimal medium. 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose were used as the sole sources of nitrogen and carbon, respectively (Cambridge Isotopes). The E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C and incubated with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of ∼0.8, and cell growth was continued at 18 °C for 20 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.02% NaN3), and sonicated by passing thrice through a high pressure homogenizer (EmulsiFlex-C3 from Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). The lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded to an amylose column (New England Biolabs) equilibrated with the above lysate buffer and eluted with 10 mm maltose (Sigma-Aldrich). The eluted protein fractions were cleaved with tobacco etch virus protease (1100 of the A280 of the protein) at room temperature overnight. The cleaved TM-LAMP-2A was further purified by HPLC (Invitrogen) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA. The fractions containing purified TM-LAMP-2A were lyophilized, and TFA was removed by washing with H2O several times. The purity of the TM-LAMP-2A preparation was confirmed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (the measured molecular mass was 4480.36 Da, whereas the theoretical molecular mass is 4480.1 Da). The Hsp40 and substrate binding domain of Hsc70 (sbd-Hsc70) were expressed in E. coli and purified using affinity chromatography. The NaCl in the buffer used for Hsp40 purification was increased to 1.5 m to minimize copurification of proteins bound to Hsp40. The protein RNase A and RNase S peptide were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Biosynthesis, respectively. The purified TM-LAMP-2A was reconstituted in different micelles (SDS, lysopalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol, DPC, and DPC + dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) and screened for better solubility by varying pH, salt concentrations, and temperatures using NMR by monitoring its 15N,1H HSQC spectra. Based on the spectral quality and the total number of cross-peaks in the 15N,1H HSQC, the optimal sample condition was to dissolve the TM-LAMP-2A in micelles consisting of 150 mm DPC doped with 5 mm dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. For all NMR experiments, deuterated detergents were used to prepare the micelles. All NMR experiments were carried out at 37 °C on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer with a room temperature probe, a Bruker Avance 600 MHz, a Bruker Avance 800 MHz, or a Bruker Avance 900 MHz spectrometer with cryogenic probes.

This in vitro study evaluates whether relaxin also has a direct protective action on cardiac muscle cells. H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts and primary mouse cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia and reoxygenation. In some experiments, relaxin was added preventatively before hypoxia; in others, at reoxygenation. To elucidate its mechanisms of action, we focused on Notch-1, which is involved in heart pre- and postconditioning to ischemia. Inactivated RLX was used as negative control. Relaxin (17 nmol/L, EC50 4.7 nmol/L), added 24 h before hypoxia or at reoxygenation, protected against cardiomyocyte injury. In fact, relaxin significantly increased cell viability (assayed by trypan blue and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), decreased apoptosis (assayed by TUNEL and bax/bcl-2 ratio), and reduced nitroxidative damage (assayed by nitrotyrosine expression and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine levels). These effects were partly attributable to the ability of relaxin to upregulate Notch-1 signaling; indeed, blockade of Notch-1 activation with the specific inhibitor DAPT reduced relaxin-induced cardioprotection during hypoxia and reoxygenation.

However, little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms regulating PKCδ expression in neurons. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which the PKCδ gene can be regulated by histone acetylation. Treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaBu) induced PKCδ expression in cultured neurons, brain slices, and animal models. Several other HDAC inhibitors also mimicked NaBu. The chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that hyperacetylation of histone H4 by NaBu is associated with the PKCδ promoter. Deletion analysis of the PKCδ promoter mapped the NaBu-responsive element to an 81-bp minimal promoter region. Detailed mutagenesis studies within this region revealed that four GC boxes conferred hyperacetylation-induced PKCδ promoter activation. Cotransfection experiments and Sp inhibitor studies demonstrated that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 regulated NaBu-induced PKCδ up-regulation. However, NaBu did not alter the DNA binding activities of Sp proteins or their expression. Interestingly, a one-hybrid analysis revealed that NaBu enhanced transcriptional activity of Sp1/Sp3. Overexpression of the p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) potentiated the NaBu-mediated transactivation potential of Sp1/Sp3, but expressing several HDACs attenuated this effect, suggesting that p300/CBP and HDACs act as coactivators or corepressors in histone acetylation-induced PKCδ up-regulation. Finally, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that NaBu up-regulation of PKCδ sensitizes neurons to cell death in a human dopaminergic cell model and brain slice cultures.

https://openalex.org/W2135783627,"Type 4 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu4) receptors are emerging targets for the treatment of various disorders. Accordingly, numerous mGlu4-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have been identified, some of which also display agonist activity. To identify the structural bases for their allosteric action, we explored the relationship between the binding pockets of mGlu4 PAMs with different chemical scaffolds and their functional properties. By use of innovative mGlu4 biosensors and second-messenger assays, we show that all PAMs enhance agonist action on the receptor through different degrees of allosteric agonism and positive cooperativity. For example, whereas VU0155041 and VU0415374 display equivalent efficacies [log(τ(B)) = 1.15 ± 0.38 and 1.25 ± 0.44, respectively], they increase the ability of L-AP4 to stabilize the active conformation of the receptor by 4 and 39 times, respectively. Modeling and docking studies identify 2 overlapping binding pockets as follows: a first site homologous to the pocket of natural agonists of class A GPCRs linked to allosteric agonism and a second one pointing toward a site topographically homologous to the Na(+) binding pocket of class A GPCRs, occupied by PAMs exhibiting the strongest cooperativity. These results reveal that intrinsic efficacy and cooperativity of mGlu4 PAMs are correlated with their binding mode, and vice versa, integrating structural and functional knowledge from different GPCR classes."

We show that North Pacific deep waters were substantially colder (4°C) and probably fresher than the North Atlantic Deep Water before the intensification of NHG. At ~2.73 Ma, the Atlantic-Pacific temperature gradient was reduced to <1°C, suggesting the initiation of stronger heat transfer from the North Atlantic to the deep Pacific. We posit that increased glaciation of Antarctica, deduced from the 21 ± 10-meter sea-level fall from 3.15 to 2.75 Ma, and the development of a strong polar halocline fundamentally altered deep ocean circulation, which enhanced interhemispheric heat and salt transport, thereby contributing to NHG."
https://openalex.org/W2130781494,"Trauma/hemorrhagic shock is associated with morbidity and mortality due to dysregulated inflammation, which is driven in part by monocytes/macrophages stimulated by injury-induced release of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules. MRP8/MRP14 is an endogenous DAMP involved in various inflammatory diseases, though its mechanism of action is unclear. Circulating MRP8/MRP14 levels in human blunt trauma nonsurvivors were significantly lower than those of survivors (P < 0.001). Human monocytic THP-1 cells stimulated with MRP8/MRP14 expressed the chemokine IFN-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10)/CXCL10. Circulating IP-10 levels in human blunt trauma patients were correlated positively with MRP8/MRP14 levels (r = 0.396, P < 0.001), and were significantly lower in trauma nonsurvivors than in survivors (P < 0.001). We therefore sought to determine the mechanisms by which MRP8/MRP14 stimulates IP-10 in monocytes/macrophages, and found that induction of IP-10 by MRP8/MRP14 required Toll-like receptor 4 and TRIF but not MyD88. Full induction of IP-10 by MRP8/MRP14 required synergy between the transcription factors NF-κB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The receptor for IP-10 is CXCR3, and MRP8/MRP14-induced chemotaxis of CXCR3+ cells was dependent on the production of IP-10 in monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, in vivo study with a mouse trauma/hemorrhagic shock model showed that administration of neutralizing antibody against MRP8 prevented activation of NF-κB and IRF3 as well as IP-10 production. Thus, the current study identified a novel signaling mechanism that controls IP-10 expression in monocytes/macrophages by MRP8/MRP14, which may play an important role in injury-induced inflammation.—Wang, J., Vodovotz, Y., Fan, L., Li, Y., Liu, Z., Namas, R., Barclay, D., Zamora, R., Billiar, T.

https://openalex.org/W2060040928,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic hepatitis in humans, and HBV infection is a major threat to global health. HBV replication is regulated by a series of host factors, including microRNAs (miRNAs), which are highly conserved small noncoding RNAs that participate in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Here, we report that a chemically synthesized mimic of miR-26b inhibited HBV antigen expression, transcription, and replication, whereas antisense knockdown of endogenous miR-26b enhanced HBV replication in HepG2 cells. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that miR-26b significantly decreased HBV enhancer/promoter activities. We identified the cysteine- and histidine-rich domain containing 1 (CHORDC1) as a novel host factor target of miR-26b. CHORDC1 protein but not mRNA was markedly decreased by miR-26b overexpression via base-pairing with complementary sequences in the 3'UTR of its mRNA. Overexpression and knockdown studies showed that CHORDC1 increased viral antigen expression, transcription, and replication by elevating HBV enhancer/promoter activities. Conversely, HBV infection suppressed miR-26b expression and increased CHORDC1 protein levels in human liver cells. Another mature miRNA of the hsa-miR-26 family, miR-26a, had a similar function as miR-26b in targeting CHORDC1 and affecting HBV production. These results suggest that suppression of miR-26b expression up-regulates its target gene CHORDC1, which increases HBV enhancer/promoter activities and promotes viral transcription, gene expression, and replication. Our study could provide new insights into miRNA expression and the persistence of HBV infection."

https://openalex.org/W2062274823,"Trp-Asp (WD) repeat protein 68 (WDR68) is an evolutionarily conserved WD40 repeat protein that binds to several proteins, including dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase (DYRK1A), MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), and Cullin4-damage-specific DNA-binding protein 1 (CUL4-DDB1). WDR68 affects multiple and diverse physiological functions, such as controlling anthocyanin synthesis in plants, tissue growth in insects, and craniofacial development in vertebrates. However, the biochemical basis and the regulatory mechanism of WDR68 activity remain largely unknown. To better understand the cellular function of WDR68, here we have isolated and identified cellular WDR68 binding partners using a phosphoproteomic approach. More than 200 cellular proteins with wide varieties of biochemical functions were identified as WDR68-binding protein candidates. Eight T-complex protein 1 (TCP1) subunits comprising the molecular chaperone TCP1 ring complex/chaperonin-containing TCP1 (TRiC/CCT) were identified as major WDR68-binding proteins, and phosphorylation sites in both WDR68 and TRiC/CCT were identified. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the binding between TRiC/CCT and WDR68. Computer-aided structural analysis suggested that WDR68 forms a seven-bladed β-propeller ring. Experiments with a series of deletion mutants in combination with the structural modeling showed that three of the seven β-propeller blades of WDR68 are essential and sufficient for TRiC/CCT binding. Knockdown of cellular TRiC/CCT by siRNA caused an abnormal WDR68 structure and led to reduction of its DYRK1A-binding activity. Concomitantly, nuclear accumulation of WDR68 was suppressed by the knockdown of TRiC/CCT, and WDR68 formed cellular aggregates when overexpressed in the TRiC/CCT-deficient cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the molecular chaperone TRiC/CCT is essential for correct protein folding, DYRK1A binding, and nuclear accumulation of WDR68."

This survey was aimed to determine prevalence and factors associated with current smoking among the students of College of Health Sciences, Mekelle University, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was employed using a structured self-administered questionnaire among College of Health Sciences students in March 2013. A stratified random sampling method was employed to select study participants. Data were entered and analysed using of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Results Of the 193 students, 57 (29.5%) of the students were current smokers. Most of the current smokers (89.4%) smoked between 1–10 sticks of cigarette per day. The two main reasons cited for smoking cigarettes were peer pressure (43.9%) and to relieve stress (36.8%). Being female (adjusted OR [AOR] = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.95) and Tigre by ethnicity (AOR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.74) were significantly less associated with current smoking. On the other hand, being second year students (AOR = 3.84; 95% CI: 1.41, 10.46), khat chewing (AOR = 8.36; 95% CI: 2.60, 26.85) and taking illicit drugs (AOR = 10.59; 95% CI: 2.77, 40.51) were positively associated with current smoking cigarettes. Conclusions The current smoking prevalence among students in College of Health Sciences, Mekelle University is high and therefore, effective smoking prevention and cessation intervention programs are required to reduce smoking among university students."
https://openalex.org/W2052501998,"Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is a type of non-melanoma skin cancer prevalent in immune-suppressed transplant recipients and older individuals with a history of chronic sun-exposure. SCC itself is believed to be a late-stage manifestation that can develop from premalignant lesions including Intraepidermal Carcinoma (IEC). Notably, while SCC regression is rare, IEC typically regresses in response to immune modifying topical treatments, however the underlying immunological reasons for these differential responses remain unclear. This study aimed to define whether IEC and SCC are associated with distinct immune profiles. We investigated the immune cell infiltrate of photo-damaged skin, IEC, and SCC tissue using 10-colour flow cytometry following fresh lesion digest. We found that IEC lesions contain higher percentages of CD3+ T-cells than photo-damaged skin, however, the abundance of CD3-CD56+ Natural Killer (NK) cells, CD11c+HLA-DR+ conventional Dendritic Cells (cDC), BDCA-2+HLA-DR+ plasmacytoid DC (pDC), FoxP3+ Regulatory T-cells (T-reg), Vα24+Vβ11+ invariant NKT-cells, and γδ Tcells did not alter with disease stage. Within the total T-cell population, high percentages of CD4+ T-cells were associated with SCC, yet CD8+ T-cells were less abundant in SCC compared with IEC. Our study demonstrates that while IEC lesions contain a higher proportion of T-cells than SCC lesions in general, SCC lesions specifically display a lower abundance of CD8+ T-cells than IEC. We propose that differences in CD8+ T-cell abundance contribute critically to the different capacity of SCC and IEC to regress in response to immune modifying topical treatments. Our study also suggests that a high ratio of CD4+ T-cells to CD8+ T-cells may be a immunological diagnostic indicator of late-stage SCC development in immune-competent patients."

Fexor tendon injury and repair result in adhesion formation around the tendon, which restricts the gliding function of the tendon, leading to decreased digit mobility and impaired hand recovery. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the peptide PXL01 in preventing adhesions, and correspondingly improving hand function, in flexor tendon repair surgery.This prospective, randomised, double-blind trial included 138 patients admitted for flexor tendon repair surgery. PXL01 in carrier sodium hyaluronate or placebo was administered around the repaired tendon. Efficacy was assessed by total active motion of the injured finger, tip-to-crease distance, sensory function, tenolysis rate and grip strength, and safety parameters were followed, for 12 months post-surgery.The most pronounced difference between the treatment groups was observed at 6 months post-surgery. At this timepoint, the total active motion of the distal finger joint was improved in the PXL01 group (60 vs. 41 degrees for PXL01 vs. placebo group, p = 0.016 in PPAS). The proportion of patients with excellent/good digit mobility was higher in the PXL01 group (61% vs. 38%, p = 0.0499 in PPAS). Consistently, the PXL01 group presented improved tip-to-crease distance (5.0 vs. 15.5 mm for PXL01 vs. placebo group, p = 0.048 in PPAS). Sensory evaluation showed that more patients in the PXL01 group felt the thinnest monofilaments (FAS: 74% vs. 35%, p = 0.021; PPAS: 76% vs. 35%, p = 0.016). At 12 months post-surgery, more patients in the placebo group were considered to benefit from tenolysis (30% vs. 12%, p = 0.086 in PPAS). The treatment was safe, well tolerated, and did not increase the rate of tendon rupture.Treatment with PXL01 in sodium hyaluronate improves hand recovery after flexor tendon repair surgery.

https://openalex.org/W2016100081,"Soil sickness is a critical problem for eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) under continuous cropping that affects sustainable eggplant production. Relay intercropping is a significant technique on promoting soil quality, improving eco-environment, and raising output. Field experiments were conducted from September 2010 to November 2012 in northwest China to determine the effects of relay intercropping eggplant with garlic (Allium sativum L.) on soil enzyme activities, available nutrient contents, and pH value under a plastic tunnel. Three treatments were in triplicate using randomized block design: eggplant monoculture (CK), eggplant relay intercropping with normal garlic (NG) and eggplant relay intercropping with green garlic (GG). The major results are as follows: (1) the activities of soil invertase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase were generally enhanced in NG and GG treatments; (2) relay intercropping significantly increased the soil available nutrient contents, and they were mostly higher in GG than NG. On April 11, 2011, the eggplant/garlic co-growth stage, the available nitrogen content in GG was 76.30 mg·kg−1, significantly higher than 61.95 mg·kg−1 in NG. For available potassium on April 17, 2012, they were 398.48 and 387.97 mg·kg−1 in NG and GG, both were significantly higher than 314.84 mg·kg−1 in CK; (3) the soil pH showed a significantly higher level in NG treatment, but lower in GG treatment compared with CK. For the last samples in 2012, soil pH in NG and GG were 7.70 and 7.46, the highest and lowest one among them; (4) the alkaline phosphatase activity and pH displayed a similar decreasing trend with continuous cropping. These findings indicate that relay intercropping eggplant with garlic could be an ideal farming system to effectively improve soil nutrient content, increase soil fertility, and alleviate soil sickness to some extent. These findings are important in helping to develop sustainable eggplant production."

We examine the impact of HO-2 deficiency on macrophage function and the contribution of macrophage HO-2 to inflammatory and repair responses to injury. Corneal epithelial debridement was performed in control and macrophage-depleted HO-2(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice and in bone marrow chimeras. Peritoneal macrophages were collected for determination of phagocytic activity and classically activated macrophage (M1)-alternatively activated macrophage (M2) polarization. Depletion of macrophages delayed corneal healing (13.2%) and increased neutrophil infiltration (54.1%) by day 4 in WT mice, whereas in HO-2(-/-) mice, it did not worsen the already impaired wound healing and exacerbated inflammation. HO-2(-/-) macrophages displayed an altered M1 phenotype with no significant expression of M2 or M2-like activated cells and a 31.3% reduction in phagocytic capacity that was restored by inducing HO-1 activity or supplementing biliverdin. Macrophage depletion had no effect, whereas adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow improved wound healing (34% on day 4) but did not resolve the exaggerated inflammatory response in HO-2(-/-) mice. These findings indicate that HO-2-deficient macrophages are dysfunctional and that macrophage HO-2 is required for proper macrophage function but is insufficient to correct the impaired healing of the HO-2(-/-) cornea, suggesting that corneal epithelial expression of HO-2 is a key to resolution and repair in wound healing."

However, excess amounts of Cu are toxic and result in a wide range of harmful effects on the physiological and biochemical processes of plants. Cell wall has a crucial role in plant defense response to toxic metals. To date, the process of cell wall response to Cu and the detoxification mechanism have not been well documented at the proteomic level. Methods An recently developed 6-plex Tandem Mass Tag was used for relative and absolute quantitation methods to achieve a comprehensive understanding of Cu tolerance/detoxification molecular mechanisms in the cell wall. LC–MS/MS approach was performed to analyze the Cu-responsive cell wall proteins and polysaccharides. Key Results The majority of the 22 up-regulated proteins were involved in the antioxidant defense pathway, cell wall polysaccharide remodeling, and cell metabolism process. Changes in polysaccharide amount, composition, and distribution could offer more binding sites for Cu ions. The 33 down-regulated proteins were involved in the signal pathway, energy, and protein synthesis. Conclusions Based on the abundant changes in proteins and polysaccharides, and their putative functions, a possible protein interaction network can provide new insights into Cu stress response in root cell wall. Cu can facilitate further functional research on target proteins associated with metal response in the cell wall."

It is reported that micro RNAs (miR) are associated with tumor development. This study aims to investigate the role of miR-92a in the development of tolerant natural killer T (NKT) cells. In this study, U87 cells (a human glioma cell line) and primary glioma cells were prepared. The assessment of miR-92a was performed by real time RT-PCR. The expression of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6 in NKT cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Results showed that abundant IL-6(+) IL-10(+) NKT cells were detected in glioma tissue. Cultures of glioma cells and NKT cells induced the expression of IL-6 and IL-10 in NKT cells. Glioma cells expressed miR-92a; the latter played a critical role in the induction of IL-6 and IL-10 expression in NKT cells. The expression of the antitumor molecules, including perforin, Fas ligand, and interferon-γ, was significantly attenuated compared with control NKT cells. The IL-6(+) IL-10(+) NKT cells showed less capability in the induction of apoptosis in glioma cells, but showed the immune suppressor functions on CD8(+) T cell activities. We conclude that glioma-derived miR-92a induces IL-6(+) IL-10(+) NKT cells; this fraction of NKT cells can suppress cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells."

We sought to elucidate the presence and types of lung bacterial populations in different stages of COPD, aimed at revealing important insights into the pathobiology of the disease. Sequencing of the bacterial small subunit ribosomal RNA gene in 55 well-characterized clinical lung samples, revealed the presence of Novosphingobium spp. (>2% abundance) in lungs of patients with GOLD 3-GOLD 4 COPD, cystic fibrosis and a subset of control individuals. Novosphingobium-specific quantitative PCR was concordant with the sequence data and high levels of Novosphingobium spp. were quantifiable in advanced COPD, but not from other disease stages. Using a mouse model of subacute lung injury due to inhalation of cigarette smoke, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil and macrophage counts were significantly higher in mice challenged intratracheally with N. panipatense compared to control mice (p<0.01). Frequencies of neutrophils and macrophages in lung tissue were increased in mice challenged with N. panipatense at room air compared to controls. However, we did not observe an interaction between N. panipatense and subacute cigarette smoke exposure in the mouse.

We investigated independent mortality predictors of geriatric patients with fever and developed a prediction rule for emergency care, critical care, and geriatric care physicians to classify patients into mortality risk and disposition groups. Materials and Methods Consecutive geriatric patients (≥65 years old) visiting the emergency department (ED) of a university-affiliated medical center between June 1 and July 21, 2010, were enrolled when they met the criteria of fever: a tympanic temperature ≥37.2°C or a baseline temperature elevated ≥1.3°C. Thirty-day mortality was the primary endpoint. Internal validation with bootstrap re-sampling was done. Results Three hundred thirty geriatric patients were enrolled. We found three independent mortality predictors: Leukocytosis (WBC >12,000 cells/mm3), Severe coma (GCS ≤ 8), and Thrombocytopenia (platelets <150 103/mm3) (LST). After assigning weights to each predictor, we developed a Geriatric Fever Score that stratifies patients into two mortality-risk and disposition groups: low (4.0%) (95% CI: 2.3–6.9%): a general ward or treatment in the ED then discharge and high (30.3%) (95% CI: 17.4–47.3%): consider the intensive care unit. The area under the curve for the rule was 0.73. Conclusions We found that the Geriatric Fever Score is a simple and rapid rule for predicting 30-day mortality and classifying mortality risk and disposition in geriatric patients with fever, although external validation should be performed to confirm its usefulness in other clinical settings. It might help preserve medical resources for patients in greater need."

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20234-20239Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In step 1, the antibodies attach to the viral membrane through their long, hydrophobic CDRH3 loops. This weak reversible binding preconcentrates the antibody on the virion surface until binding of gp120 to CD4 and the chemokine coreceptor triggers the gp41 conformational change leading to formation of the prehairpin intermediate, with the fusion peptide inserted into the target cell membrane (10Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Mechanisms of viral membrane fusion and its inhibition.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). As a consequence, during the relatively short window of opportunity (estimated to be about 15 min (11Muñoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. Dilation of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 envelope glycoprotein fusion pore revealed by the inhibitory action of a synthetic peptide from gp41.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar)) before fusion is completed, the local concentration of the antibody in the vicinity of the MPER epitope is much higher than the bulk aqueous concentration, driving formation of a high affinity complex (step 2), which prevents fusion from proceeding to completion. An open question, with important practical implications, is whether an MPER bnAb simply needs to possess the two properties or if a very specific geometry of the combining site is required, as present in 2F5 and 4E10. Two recent studies seem to support the latter hypothesis, proposing that the CDRH3 loop of 2F5 participates in a membrane-embedded “extended paratope” (12Kim M. Sun Z.-Y. J. Rand K.D. Shi X. Song L. Cheng Y. Fahmy A.F. Majumdar S. Ofek G. Yang Y. Kwong P.D. Wang J.-H. Engen J.R. Wagner G. Reinherz E.L.

Structure-guided alterations of the gp41-directed HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 reveal new properties regarding its neutralizing function.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002806Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A third study, however, questions this conclusion (13Guenaga J. Wyatt R.T. Structure-guided alterations of the gp41-directed HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 reveal new properties regarding its neutralizing function.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002806Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). If the two-step hypothesis is true, one could imagine engineering membrane affinity outside of the antibody paratope, in this way making general the special mechanism of 2F5/4E10. To address this issue, we have sought a general way to increase the affinity of an antibody for lipid membranes without the need of a special sequence in its CDRH3. A substantial body of evidence supports the notion that viral fusion occurs in confined areas of the interacting viral/host membranes (14Ono A. Freed E.O. Role of lipid rafts in virus replication.Adv. Virus Res. 2005; 64: 311-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For HIV, the lipid composition of the viral membrane is strikingly different from that of the host cell membrane, being particularly enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (9Brügger B. Glass B. Haberkant P. Leibrecht I. Wieland F.T. Kräusslich H.G. The HIV lipidome: a raft with an unusual composition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Glass B. Haberkant P. Leibrecht I. Wieland F.T. Kräusslich H.G. The HIV lipidome: a raft with an unusual composition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We have recently shown that the efficient targeting to lipid rafts can be achieved by conjugation of a cholesterol group and that this modification brings a dramatic increase in antiviral potency of peptide fusion inhibitors derived from the heptad repeat region of fusion proteins, including gp41 (20Welsch J.C.

Our findings have been independently confirmed (26Francis J.N. Redman J.S. Eckert D.M. Kay M.S. Design of a modular tetrameric scaffold for the synthesis of membrane-localized D-peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 entry.Bioconjug Chem. 2012; 23: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Conjugation to sphingosine has also been shown to potentiate antiviral activity (27Ashkenazi A. Viard M. Unger L. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. Sphingopeptides: dihydrosphingosine-based fusion inhibitors against wild-type and enfuvirtide-resistant HIV-1.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 4628-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Importantly, cholesterol conjugation has been shown to efficiently localize the much larger green fluorescent protein to the membrane of living cells (28Teruya K. Nishizawa K. Doh-ura K. Semisynthesis of a protein with cholesterol at the C-terminal, targeted to the cell membrane of live cells.Protein J. 2010; 29: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on this, we asked if conjugation of cholesterol to a previously described CDRH3 mutant of 2F5, which is unable to neutralize HIV (5Ofek G. McKee K. Yang Y. Yang Z.Y. Skinner J. Guenaga F.J. Wyatt R. Zwick M.B. Nabel G.J. Mascola J.R. Kwong P.D. Relationship between antibody 2F5 neutralization of HIV-1 and hydrophobicity of its heavy chain third complementarity-determining region.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), could rescue its antiviral activity. We show here that this is the case and that cholesterol conjugation can also increase the antiviral activity of another HIV antibody, D5, which is devoid of membrane affinity. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293 ATCC CCL1573) were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. HEK 293 EBNA cells (Invitrogen, catalogue no. R620-07) were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and G418 (Invitrogen) at 0.25 mg/ml. The HEK 293T cell line was purchased from ECACC, and the HeLa TZM-bl cell line was obtained through the Programme EVA Centre for AIDS Reagents, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC). Both were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% nonessential amino acids. Monoclonal antibodies were produced in HEK 293 EBNA cells cultured in CDCHO medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 μm hypoxanthine and 16 μm thymidine (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney 293T/17 cells (ATCC: CRL-11268) (1.2 × 106) were seeded in 10-cm2 dishes. After 24 h, cells were co-transfected with 2 μg each of a pNL4.3 construct lacking env and an env+ pcDNA3.1 D-TOPO expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 72 h post-transfection, culture supernatants containing pseudotype virus were filtered through 0.22-μm filters and stored at 4 °C. All tested mAbs were generated by subcloning of synthetic heavy and light chain variable regions (GeneArt, Invitrogen) into two eukaryotic vectors for the expression of heavy (IgG1 isotype) and light chains, as described previously (29Persic L. Roberts A. Wilton J. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. Hoogenboom H.R. An integrated vector system for the eukaryotic expression of antibodies or their fragments after selection from phage display libraries.Gene. 1997; 187: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These two plasmids were co-transfected into HEK 293 EBNA cells with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), and whole human IgG was purified from culture medium with Hi-Trap protein A columns (GE Healthcare). Cholesterol-PEG12-maleimide (compound 1 in Fig. 1) was obtained from Charnwood Molecular Ltd. (Loughborough, UK). To ensure reactivity of the free cysteines introduced in the mAb sequence, the antibodies were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with a 200-fold molar excess of l-cysteine in triethylamine buffer (pH 8.0) in N2 atmosphere. Reduced mAbs were buffer-exchanged into conjugation buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) on PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare). Next, octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) was added to the mAbs solution to a final concentration of 40 mm, and antibodies were reacted with a 10-fold molar excess of cholesterol-PEG12-maleimide for 2 h at room temperature. mAbs were then bound to Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) overnight at room temperature with constant rotation in a vertical rotator. Bound mAbs were washed four times with 20 resin volumes of 40 mm octyl β-d-glucopyranoside in conjugation buffer, followed by four washing steps with 20 resin volumes of plain conjugation buffer. mAbs were eluted from resin with 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.7) and neutralized with the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) to a final concentration of 100 mm. Eluted mAbs were buffer-exchanged into PBS on PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare). Conjugation efficiency was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, and the results were in good agreement. Conjugation efficiency varied with the reaction conditions. Although it was possible to fully derivatize the unpaired cysteine residue, driving conjugation to completion led to the appearance of SDS gel bands corresponding to incorporation of more than two maleimido-PEG12-chol molecules per antibody (confirmed by MS). Although maleimide-based reagents are selective for free thiols at neutral pH, reaction with primary amines has been documented at higher pH (30Sharpless N.E. Flavin M. The reactions of amines and amino acids with maleimides: structure of the reaction products deduced from infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 2963-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the pKa of individual lysine residues can be influenced by structural and environmental features (31He Y. Xu J. Pan X.M. A statistical approach to the prediction of pKa values in proteins.Proteins. 2007; 69: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hence, it was decided to use the conditions reported above, which led to the target antibody with two cholesterol groups per molecule in the presence of residual unconjugated antibody. The percentage of conjugation varied from 50 to 70%. For the experiments described here, the concentration of cholesterol-conjugated antibody was adjusted based on the SDS data. Because the difference in antiviral IC50 between the cholesterol-conjugated/unconjugated antibodies was always >10-fold and typically 100-fold, the presence of residual unconjugated antibody in the conjugated antibody sample was considered irrelevant for the interpretation of results. The analytical data for the antibodies described here are reported in Fig. 2. HEK 293 cells (7.5 × 105) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HIV-1 mAbs in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10 mm HEPES (fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer). mAb binding was revealed by Fcγ-specific, allophycocyanin-conjugated goat antihuman IgG. As a control, isotype-matched human IgG1 was used. FACS acquisitions and analyses were performed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software. HEK 293 cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) diluted in serum-free DMEM. After incubation, cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM prior to flow cytometry (FACS) assays. HeLa TZM-bl cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 96-well Optilux plate (BD Biosciences). After 24 h, pseudotype virus and 200 μl of medium were added and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, for 72 h. Medium was then removed, cells were lysed with 50 μl of cell lysis buffer (Promega), and 50 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) was added. Luminescence was measured by using a BMG Labtech Optima plate reader. For neutralization assays, pseudotype virus was mixed with dilutions of mAbs, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then added to TZM-bl cells plated into a 96-well Optilux plate containing 100 μl of medium, and the plates were incubated for 4 h before an additional 100 μl of medium was added. Cultures were incubated and read as for the infectivity assay. For cell binding assays, dilutions of mAbs were added to TZM-bl cells plated into a 96-well Optilux plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. They were then washed with PBS to remove unbound antibody, and pseudotype virus was added. The plates were incubated for 4 h before an additional 100 μl of medium was added. Cultures were incubated and read as for the infectivity assay. Synergistic, additive, or antagonistic interaction by two antibodies for virus neutralization was evaluated by the median effect analysis method, as described (32Chou T.C. Theoretical basis, experimental design, and computerized simulation of synergism and antagonism in drug combination studies.Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 621-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar), using the CompuSyn software (ComboSyn Inc., Paramus, NJ). This approach takes the potency, shape, and slope of the dose-dependent neutralization curve of each antibody into account, both alone and in combination, at a constant ratio, to calculate a combination index (CI). A CI value of <1 indicates synergism, 1 indicates an additive effect, and >1 indicates antagonism. For each antibody, dose-dependent neutralization was initially measured to determine a concentration range. Neutralization values of serial 5-fold dilutions of each antibody alone and in combination were then measured in a range of concentrations above and below the IC50 values. The measured neutralization values were entered into the program as fractional effects in the range of 0.01 < fractional effect < 0.99 for each of the two antibodies and for both in combination. The software determines the linear correlation coefficient, r, of each curve to indicate the fit or conformity of the data with respect to the median effect method and calculates the CI values in relation to fractional effect values. The cultures were incubated and read as for the neutralization assay. Prior to MALDI-TOF analysis, each antibody (0.3 mg/ml diluted in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate) was reduced by the addition of 5 μl of 0.2 m dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by immediate cooling at 4 °C. MS analysis was performed on a MALDI-TOF micro MX instrument (Waters Co., Manchester, UK) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm). The instrument source voltage was set to 12 kV. The pulse voltage was optimized at 1999 V, and the detector voltage was set to 5200 V. Measurements were performed in the mass range m/z 20,000–80,000, with a suppression mass gate set to m/z 3000 to prevent detector saturation from matrix cluster peaks and an extraction delay of 600 ns. Prior to acquisition of spectra, 1 μl of reduced antibody solution was mixed with 1 μl of saturated sinapinic acid matrix solution (10 mg/ml in acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1.5, v/v)). A droplet (1 μl) of the resulting mixture was placed on the mass spectrometer's sample target and dried at room temperature. After complete evaporation of the liquid, the sample was loaded into the mass spectrometer and analyzed in positive acquisition linear mode. External calibration was with a mixture of standard proteins (10 pmol/μl each of insulin, cytochrome c, trypsinogen, and albumin; Sigma). Mass accuracy near the nominal value (300 ppm) was achieved for each standard. All spectra were processed and analyzed using MassLynx version 4.1 software (Waters, Milford, MA). The peptide antigens for the ELISA experiments were prepared by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase methods. Peptide sequences were as follows: P1728, Glu-Leu-Leu-Glu-Leu-Asp-Lys-Trp-Ala-Ser-Leu-Trp-Asn-Lys(Nϵ-biotin)-NH2; P2370, Ac-Ile-Glu-Lys-Lys-Ile-Glu-Ala-Ile-Glu-Lys-Lys-Ile-Glu-Ala-Ile-Glu-Lys-Lys-Ile-Glu-Ala-Ile-Glu-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gln-Leu-Thr-Val-Trp-Gly-Ile-Lys-Gln-Leu-Gln-Ala-Arg-Ile-Leu-NH2. For ELISA with the biotinylated HIV-1 antigen P1728, 96-well plates (Immunoplate Maxisorp, Nunc) were precoated with 0.25 μg/well streptavidin (Thermo Scientific) in coating buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6) overnight at 4 °C and washed four times with PBST buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS). Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 1 μg/well P1728 in coating buffer, subsequently washed with PBST buffer, and blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 250 μl/well of milk buffer (5% milk in PBST). Plates were incubated with various HIV-1 antibodies diluted in milk buffer overnight at 4 °C, washed, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-human IgG Fc-specific AP conjugate (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 in milk buffer. Alkaline phosphatase was revealed by incubation with p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate solution (Sigma). Results were expressed as the difference between A405 nm and A620 nm, measured by an automated ELISA reader (Envision 2102 Multilabel reader, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). ELISA with the non-biotinylated peptide P2370 was performed with the same protocol, with the exception of the streptavidin precoating step. Graphs were prepared using Prism version 5.0c or 6.0e (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) or SigmaPlot version 12.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). A suitable method to generate an antibody-cholesterol conjugate is through thiol-maleimide chemistry, whereby a cysteine residue, either native or engineered, is used for conjugation on the side of the antibody, and a reactive maleimide group is used on the cholesterol moiety (33Junutula J.R.

https://openalex.org/W1964208294,"Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and pulmonary function. Proving that there is a causal relationship between GWAS SNPs, many of which are noncoding and without known functional impact, and these traits has been elusive. Furthermore, noncoding GWAS-identified SNPs may exert trans-regulatory effects rather than impact the proximal gene. Noncoding variants in 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 4 (HTR4) are associated with pulmonary function in human GWASs. To gain insight into whether this association is causal, we tested whether Htr4-null mice have altered pulmonary function. We found that HTR4-deficient mice have 12% higher baseline lung resistance and also increased methacholine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) as measured by lung resistance (27%), tissue resistance (48%), and tissue elastance (30%). Furthermore, Htr4-null mice were more sensitive to serotonin-induced AHR. In models of exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, bleomycin, and allergic airway inflammation induced by house dust mites, pulmonary function and cytokine profiles in Htr4-null mice differed little from their wild-type controls. The findings of altered baseline lung function and increased AHR in Htr4-null mice support a causal relationship between genetic variation in HTR4 and pulmonary function identified in human GWAS."
https://openalex.org/W1996070118,"Members of the mammalian tristetraprolin family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins can bind to certain AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNAs, leading to their deadenylation and destabilization. Mammals express three or four members of this family, but Drosophila melanogaster and other insects appear to contain a single gene, Tis11. We found that recombinant Drosophila Tis11 protein could bind to ARE-containing RNA oligonucleotides with low nanomolar affinity. Remarkably, co-expression in mammalian cells with ""target"" RNAs demonstrated that Tis11 could promote destabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs and that this was partially dependent on a conserved C-terminal sequence resembling the mammalian NOT1 binding domain. Drosophila Tis11 promoted both deadenylation and decay of a target transcript in this heterologous cell system. We used chromosome deletion/duplication and P element insertion to produce two types of Tis11 deficiency in adult flies, both of which were viable and fertile. To address the hypothesis that Tis11 deficiency would lead to the abnormal accumulation of potential target transcripts, we analyzed gene expression in adult flies by deep mRNA sequencing. We identified 69 transcripts from 56 genes that were significantly up-regulated more than 1.5-fold in both types of Tis11-deficient flies. Ten of the up-regulated transcripts encoded probable proteases, but many other functional classes of proteins were represented. Many of the up-regulated transcripts contained potential binding sites for tristetraprolin family member proteins that were conserved in other Drosophila species. Tis11 is thus an ARE-binding, mRNA-destabilizing protein that may play a role in post-transcriptional gene expression in Drosophila and other insects."
https://openalex.org/W2099216473,"BACE2 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 2) is a protease localized in the brain, where it appears to play a role in the development of Alzheimer disease (AD). It is also found in the pancreas, although its biologic function is not fully known. Amyloidogenic diseases, including AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), share the accumulation of abnormally folded and insoluble proteins that interfere with cell function. Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) deposits are a key pathogenic feature of T2D. Within this context, we found by global gene expression profiling that BACE2 was up-regulated in the rat pancreatic β-cell line INS1E stably transfected with human IAPP gene (hIAPP-INS1E). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in hIAPP-INS1E cells was 30% lower than in INS1E cells. Additionally, INS1E cells transfected with a transient overexpression of BACE2 showed a 60% decrease in proliferation, a 3-fold increase in reactive oxygen species production, and a 25% reduction in GSIS compared to control cells. Remarkably, silencing of endogenous BACE2 in hIAPP-INS1E cells resulted in a significant improvement in GSIS (3-fold increase vs. untransfected cells), revealing the significant role of BACE2 expression in β-cell function. Thus, BACE2 inhibition may be useful to recover insulin secretion in hIAPP-INS1E defective cells and may be proposed as a therapeutic target for T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2044920040,"The Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family proteins mediate the adherence of infected erythrocytes to microvascular endothelia of various organs, including the placenta, thereby contributing to cerebral, placental, and other severe malaria pathogenesis. Several parasite proteins, including KAHRP and PfEMP3, play important roles in the cytoadherence by mediating the clustering of PfEMP1 in rigid knoblike structures on the infected erythrocyte surface. The lack of a subtelomeric region of chromosome 2 that contains kahrp and pfemp3 causes reduced cytoadherence. In this study, microarray transcriptome analysis showed that the absence of a gene cluster, comprising kahrp, pfemp3, and four other genes, results in the loss of parasitized erythrocytes adhering to chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S). The role of one of these genes, PF3D7_0201600/PFB0080c, which encodes PHISTb (Plasmodium helical interspersed subtelomeric b) domain-containing RESA-like protein 1 expressed on the infected erythrocyte surface, was investigated. Disruption of PFB0080c resulted in increased var2csa transcription and VAR2CSA surface expression, leading to higher C4S-binding capacity of infected erythrocytes. Further, PFB0080c-knock-out parasites stably maintained the C4S adherence through many generations of growth. Although the majority of PFB0080c-knock-out parasites bound to C4S even after culturing for 6 months, a minor population bound to both C4S and CD36. These results strongly suggest that the loss of PFB0080c markedly compromises the var gene switching process, leading to a marked reduction in the switching rate and additional PfEMP1 expression by a minor population of parasites. PFB0080c interacts with VAR2CSA and modulates knob-associated Hsp40 expression. Thus, PFB0080c may regulate VAR2CSA expression through these processes. Overall, we conclude that PFB0080c regulates PfEMP1 expression and the parasite's cytoadherence."
https://openalex.org/W1978433638,"Lowland meadow irrigation used to be widespread in Central Europe, but has largely been abandoned during the 20th century. As a result of agri-environment schemes and nature conservation efforts, meadow irrigation is now being re-established in some European regions. In the absence of natural flood events, irrigation is expected to favour fauna typical of lowland wet meadows. We analysed the effects of traditional flood irrigation on diversity, densities and species composition of three invertebrate indicator taxa in lowland meadows in Germany. Unexpectedly, alpha diversity (species richness and Simpson diversity) and beta diversity (multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions) of orthopterans, carabids, and spiders were not significantly different between irrigated and non-irrigated meadows. However, spider densities were significantly higher in irrigated meadows. Furthermore, irrigation and elevated humidity affected species composition and shifted assemblages towards moisture-dependent species. The number of species of conservation concern, however, did not differ between irrigated and non-irrigated meadows. More variable and intensive (higher duration and/or frequency) flooding regimes might provide stronger conservation benefits, additional species and enhance habitat heterogeneity on a landscape scale."
https://openalex.org/W2010758356,"Watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. and Nakai] plug seedlings were stored at 15°C in the light at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 15 µmol·m(-2)·s(-1) or in darkness for 6 days, to evaluate their chloroplast ultrastructure, and associated photosynthetic characteristics. Storage in the dark caused swelling, disordered granal arrangement, and starch grain disappearance in the chloroplasts. In contrast, the chloroplasts stored in the light were relatively normal. As a result, the light-stored seedlings had a significantly higher chlorophyll content, Fv/Fm, and Pn than did dark-stored seedlings. Regardless of whether the seedlings were stored in light or darkness, the Gs and Ls of the seedlings significantly decreased, while the Ci obviously increased when the Pn decreased after 6 days of storage. This result suggests that the decreased Pn is not solely a stomatal effect, as the effects on the chloroplasts contributed to this photosynthetic inhibition. Six days after transplanting, seedlings that were stored in the light or darkness for 2 or 4 days showed complete recovery of chloroplast ultrastructure, chlorophyll content, Fv/Fm, Gs and Pn. When the storage period increased to 6 days, the dark-stored seedlings had a significantly lower Fv/Fm and Pn than the light-stored and control seedlings 6 days after transplanting, which was mainly ascribed to incomplete recovery of chloroplast ultrastructure. Furthermore, the light-stored seedlings exhibited a significantly higher shoot dry weight during storage and a higher percentage dry weight increase after transplanting than the dark-stored seedlings. These effects were enhanced by prolonged storage (4 to 6 days). This study demonstrated that dim light during storage is beneficial for maintaining chloroplast ultrastructure as well as photosynthetic efficiency in watermelon seedlings, thus contributing to the rapid recovery of post-storage photosynthetic performance, which ensures the transplant quality of the seedlings after removal from storage."
https://openalex.org/W2077791398,"The human pathogen Shigella flexneri subverts host function and defenses by deploying a cohort of effector proteins via a type III secretion system. The IpaH family of 10 such effectors mimics ubiquitin ligases but bears no sequence or structural homology to their eukaryotic counterpoints. Using rates of (125)I-polyubiquitin chain formation as a functional read out, IpaH9.8 displays V-type positive cooperativity with respect to varying concentrations of its Ubc5B∼(125)I-ubiquitin thioester co-substrate in the nanomolar range ([S]½ = 140 ± 32 nm; n = 1.8 ± 0.1) and cooperative substrate inhibition at micromolar concentrations ([S]½ = 740 ± 240 nm; n = 1.7 ± 0.2), requiring ordered binding to two functionally distinct sites per subunit. The isosteric substrate analog Ubc5BC85S-ubiquitin oxyester acts as a competitive inhibitor of wild-type Ubc5B∼(125)I-ubiquitin thioester (Ki = 117 ± 29 nm), whereas a Ubc5BC85A product analog shows noncompetitive inhibition (Ki = 2.2 ± 0.5 μm), consistent with the two-site model. Re-evaluation of a related IpaH3 crystal structure (PDB entry 3CVR) identifies a symmetric dimer consistent with the observed cooperativity. Genetic disruption of the predicted IpaH9.8 dimer interface reduces the solution molecular weight and significantly ablates the kcat but not [S]½ for polyubiquitin chain formation. Other studies demonstrate that cooperativity requires the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat-targeting domain and is transduced through Phe(395). Additionally, these mechanistic features are conserved in a distantly related SspH2 Salmonella enterica ligase. Kinetic parallels between IpaH9.8 and the recently revised mechanism for E6AP/UBE3A (Ronchi, V. P., Klein, J. M., and Haas, A. L. (2013) E6AP/UBE3A ubiquitin ligase harbors two E2∼ubiquitin binding sites. J. Biol. Chem. 288, 10349-10360) suggest convergent evolution of the catalytic mechanisms for prokaryotic and eukaryotic ligases."
https://openalex.org/W1999722719,"Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) requires at least six months of multidrug treatment and necessitates monitoring for response to treatment. Historically, public health departments (HDs) have cared for most TB patients in the United States. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides coverage for uninsured persons and may increase the proportion of TB patients cared for by private medical providers and other providers outside HDs (PMPs). We sought to determine whether there were differences in care provided by HDs and PMPs to inform public health planning under the ACA. Methods We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of California TB registry data. We included adult TB patients with culture-positive, pulmonary TB reported in California during 2007–2011. We examined trends, described case characteristics, and created multivariate models measuring two standards of TB care in PMP- and HD-managed patients: documented culture conversion within 60 days, and use of directly observed therapy (DOT). Results The proportion of PMP-managed TB patients increased during 2007–2011 (p = 0.002). On univariable analysis (N = 4,606), older age, white, black or Asian/Pacific Islander race, and birth in the United States were significantly associated with PMP care (p<0.05). Younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, homelessness, drug or alcohol use, and cavitary and/or smear-positive TB disease, were associated with HD care. Multivariable analysis showed PMP care was associated with lack of documented culture conversion (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.37, confidence interval [CI] 1.25–1.51) and lack of DOT (aRR = 8.56, CI 6.59–11.1). Conclusion While HDs cared for TB cases with more social and clinical complexities, patients under PMP care were less likely to receive DOT and have documented culture conversion. This indicates a need for close collaboration between PMPs and HDs to ensure that optimal care is provided to all TB patients and TB transmission is halted. Strategies to enhance collaboration between HDs and PMPs should be included in ACA implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2148828934,"The extracellular protein HbpS from Streptomyces reticuli interacts with iron ions and heme. It also acts in concert with the two-component sensing system SenS-SenR in response to oxidative stress. Sequence comparisons suggested that the protein may bind a cobalamin. UV-visible spectroscopy confirmed binding (Kd = 34 μm) to aquo-cobalamin (H2OCbl(+)) but not to other cobalamins. Competition experiments with the H2OCbl(+)-coordinating ligand CN(-) and comparison of mutants identified a histidine residue (His-156) that coordinates the cobalt ion of H2OCbl(+) and substitutes for water. HbpS·Cobalamin lacks the Asp-X-His-X-X-Gly motif seen in some cobalamin binding enzymes. Preliminary tests showed that a related HbpS protein from a different species also binds H2OCbl(+). Furthermore, analyses of HbpS-heme binding kinetics are consistent with the role of HbpS as a heme-sensor and suggested a role in heme transport. Given the high occurrence of HbpS-like sequences among Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, our findings suggest a great functional versatility among these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1981091826,"A novel HIV-1 recombinant clade (CRF51_01B) was recently identified among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Singapore. As cases of sexually transmitted HIV-1 infection increase concurrently in two socioeconomically intimate countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, cross transmission of HIV-1 between said countries is highly probable. In order to investigate the timeline for the emergence of HIV-1 CRF51_01B in Singapore and its possible introduction into Malaysia, 595 HIV-positive subjects recruited in Kuala Lumpur from 2008 to 2012 were screened. Phylogenetic relationship of 485 amplified polymerase gene sequences was determined through neighbour-joining method. Next, near-full length sequences were amplified for genomic sequences inferred to be CRF51_01B and subjected to further analysis implemented through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and maximum likelihood methods. Based on the near full length genomes, two isolates formed a phylogenetic cluster with CRF51_01B sequences of Singapore origin, sharing identical recombination structure. Spatial and temporal information from Bayesian MCMC coalescent and maximum likelihood analysis of the protease, gp120 and gp41 genes suggest that Singapore is probably the country of origin of CRF51_01B (as early as in the mid-1990s) and featured a Malaysian who acquired the infection through heterosexual contact as host for its ancestral lineages. CRF51_01B then spread rapidly among the MSM in Singapore and Malaysia. Although the importation of CRF51_01B from Singapore to Malaysia is supported by coalescence analysis, the narrow timeframe of the transmission event indicates a closely linked epidemic. Discrepancies in the estimated divergence times suggest that CRF51_01B may have arisen through multiple recombination events from more than one parental lineage. We report the cross transmission of a novel CRF51_01B lineage between countries that involved different sexual risk groups. Understanding the cross-border transmission of HIV-1 involving sexual networks is crucial for effective intervention strategies in the region."

https://openalex.org/W2089195221,"Apolipoprotein E Receptor 2 (ApoER2) and the tyrosine kinase Fyn are both members of the Reelin pathway, a signaling pathway essential for the laminar formation of the cortex during development and proper dendritic spine density and long-term potential (LTP) in the adult brain. In the presence of extracellular Reelin, ApoER2 binds the intracellular protein Dab1, an adaptor protein that is phosphorylated by Fyn. However, direct interactions between ApoER2 and Fyn are not well defined. Here, we show that total levels of ApoER2 and surface levels of ApoER2 are increased by active Fyn. Via a separate mechanism, ApoER2 is also phosphorylated by Fyn, an event that peaks in the postnatal cortex at day 5 and can occur at multiple ApoER2 tyrosine residues. Dab1 is also involved in this phosphorylation, promoting the phosphorylation of ApoER2 by Fyn when it is itself phosphorylated. These results elucidate some of the intracellular mechanisms that give rise to a functional Reelin pathway."
