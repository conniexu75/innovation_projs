The product of the first reaction catalyzed by the GDP phos- phorylation enzyme is GTP. The second step, transphosphorylation from GTP to ADP, is catalyzed by NDP kinase. GTP has been isolated from the reaction and identified. For the synthesis of succinyl CoA from ATP both enzymes and GDP are necessary. However, only the phosphoryl- ation enzyme is necessary for succinyl CoA synthesis when GTP is used instead of ATP. IDP can substitute for GDP in the system but less ef- fectively. 4 The DPNH oxidizing activity (28) of such a preparation was only 10 to 20 per cent of that observed by Huennekens et al. Before this step the activity was 2- to 3-fold higher and in agreement with our earlier calculations that the “diaphorase” contamination amounted to 1 to 2 per cent of the total protein (10). It may be appropriate to emphasize that Huennekens et al. have compared the DPNH oxidiz- ing and KG dehydrogenase (DPN reduction) activities of the enzyme preparation at two different pH values, the former at pH 10 and the latter at pH 7.4. The observed activity, if assumed to be due to “diaphorase,” would amount to less than 1 per cent of the total protein in the preparation."

https://openalex.org/W74570680,"It has been demonstrated that Cl402 administered to fasted rats (2) or incubated with liver slices from fasted animals (3) yields glycogen which is labeled predominantly in carbon atoms 3 and 4. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that CO2 incorporation into glycogen proceeds by a reversal of the anaerobic glycolytic pathway (4). However, during the past several years it has become evident that pathways other than the Embden-Meyerhof scheme may play a r&e in carbohydrate metabolism. It has previously been shown with liver enzyme preparations that pentose phosphate-2, 3-CY4, which may arise by the oxidation of hexose monophosphate-3,4-P, yields glucose 6-phosphate labeled in positions 1 to 4 (5). If these reactions were to occur in intact liver, isotope originally incorporated into the 3,4 position of glucose 6-phosphate would be expected to become redistributed into positions 1 and 2. While evidence for the preferential formation of CO2 from glucose C-l by liver slices has been reported by Bloom, Stetten, and Stetten (6-S) and confirmed in a number of other laboratories (g-11), there is lack of agreement as to the quantitative importance of such non-glycolytic mechanisms (8, 11). In general, studies of PO2 incorporation into glycogen have been carried out with fasted animals. It has been demonstrated, however, that fasting markedly affects glycogen formation (12), glucose and pyruvate utilization (13), and fatty acid and CO2 production (14). The present investigations were undertaken to ascertain whether the feeding of a high carbohydrate diet might lead to a distribution of tracer in glucose, which is different from that observed in studies with fasted animals. Liver slices from fasted and from fed rats were incubated with lactate in the presence of Cl402 and the glycogen was isolated and degraded. It was found that, while positions 3 and 4 were lsbeled equally when liver"

The compound was inert metabolically when fed to the rat or when injected. On treatment with acid, a small amount of thio- cyanate was produced. 2-Imino-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid was isolated from the urine of rats given sodium cyanide subcutaneously. 80 per cent of the cyanide was ac- counted for as thiocyanate. When L-cystine-W was administered first, the compounds excreted were labeled. Radioactivity measurements showed that the iminothiazolidinecarboxylic acid was produced from cystine, while the thiocyanate chiefly was formed from other sources of sulfur. The reaction with cystine constitutes an independent pathway for detoxi- cabion of cyanide. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. ScMberl, A., Kawohl, M., and Hamm, R., Chem. Ber., 84, 571 (1951). 2.
