https://openalex.org/W1971578941,"Master transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog bind enhancer elements and recruit Mediator to activate much of the gene expression program of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We report here that the ESC master transcription factors form unusual enhancer domains at most genes that control the pluripotent state. These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator. Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbation. Reduced levels of Oct4 or Mediator cause preferential loss of expression of super-enhancer-associated genes relative to other genes, suggesting how changes in gene expression programs might be accomplished during development. In other more differentiated cells, super-enhancers containing cell-type-specific master transcription factors are also found at genes that define cell identity. Super-enhancers thus play key roles in the control of mammalian cell identity."

In neuroscience generally, and in optogenetics in particular, the ability to insert light sources, detectors, sensors, and other components into precise locations of the deep brain yields versatile and important capabilities. Here, we introduce an injectable class of cellular-scale optoelectronics that offers such features, with examples of unmatched operational modes in optogenetics, including completely wireless and programmed complex behavioral control over freely moving animals. The ability of these ultrathin, mechanically compliant, biocompatible devices to afford minimally invasive operation in the soft tissues of the mammalian brain foreshadow applications in other organ systems, with potential for broad utility in biomedical science and engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2024556668,"During persistent viral infections, chronic immune activation, negative immune regulator expression, an elevated interferon signature, and lymphoid tissue destruction correlate with disease progression. We demonstrated that blockade of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling using an IFN-I receptor neutralizing antibody reduced immune system activation, decreased expression of negative immune regulatory molecules, and restored lymphoid architecture in mice persistently infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. IFN-I blockade before and after establishment of persistent virus infection resulted in enhanced virus clearance and was CD4 T cell-dependent. Hence, we demonstrate a direct causal link between IFN-I signaling, immune activation, negative immune regulator expression, lymphoid tissue disorganization, and virus persistence. Our results suggest that therapies targeting IFN-I may help control persistent virus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2049868800,"INTERFER(ON)ing Persistence During persistent viral infections, a dysregulated immune response fails to control the infection. Wilson et al. (p. 202 ) and Teijaro et al. (p. 207 ; see the Perspective by Odorizzi and Wherry ) show this occurs because type I interferons (IFN I), critical for early responses to viral infection, contribute to the altered immunity seen during persistent infection. Antibody blockade of IFN I signaling during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice resulted in reduced viral titers at later stages of infection, reduced expression of inhibitory immune molecules and prevented the disruptions to secondary lymphoid organs typically observed during persistent infection with LCMV. Whether type I IFNs are also detrimental to persistent viral infection humans, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, remains to be determined."

(p. 216 ) combined behavioral economics with brain scanning to explore how a piece of music is considered rewarding to an individual when it is heard for the first time. They discovered that neural activity in the mesolimbic striatum during listening to a novel piece of music was the best predictor of the money listeners were willing to spend on buying the piece. These observations implicate sensory cortical areas in reward processing, which the authors attribute to the aesthetic nature of the judgment."

The simplest such molecule, H 2 CO 2 , was recently detected and monitored in the laboratory. Su et al. (p. 174 ; see the Perspective by Vereecken ) have obtained its vibrational spectrum, which could ultimately enable direct measurements of its reactivity in the atmosphere. Taatjes et al.

These studies advance our understanding of cell signaling and implicate new molecular mechanisms in proximity-driven enzyme activation, threshold behavior, signal amplification, reduction of biological noise, and temporal and spatial control of signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1991266930,"The Criegee intermediates are carbonyl oxides postulated to play key roles in the reactions of ozone with unsaturated hydrocarbons; these reactions constitute an important mechanism for the removal of unsaturated hydrocarbons and for the production of OH in the atmosphere. Here, we report the transient infrared (IR) absorption spectrum of the simplest Criegee intermediate CH2OO, produced from CH2I + O2 in a flow reactor, using a step-scan Fourier-transform spectrometer. The five observed bands provide definitive identification of this intermediate. The observed vibrational frequencies are more consistent with a zwitterion rather than a diradical structure of CH2OO. The direct IR detection of CH2OO should prove useful for kinetic and mechanistic investigations of the Criegee mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2094002760,"We present Procrustean Approach to Cophylogeny (PACo), a novel statistical tool to test for congruence between phylogenetic trees, or between phylogenetic distance matrices of associated taxa. Unlike previous tests, PACo evaluates the dependence of one phylogeny upon the other. This makes it especially appropriate to test the classical coevolutionary model that assumes that parasites that spend part of their life in or on their hosts track the phylogeny of their hosts. The new method does not require fully resolved phylogenies and allows for multiple host-parasite associations. PACo produces a Procrustes superimposition plot enabling a graphical assessment of the fit of the parasite phylogeny onto the host phylogeny and a goodness-of-fit statistic, whose significance is established by randomization of the host-parasite association data. The contribution of each individual host-parasite association to the global fit is measured by means of jackknife estimation of their respective squared residuals and confidence intervals associated to each host-parasite link. We carried out different simulations to evaluate the performance of PACo in terms of Type I and Type II errors with respect to two similar published tests. In most instances, PACo performed at least as well as the other tests and showed higher overall statistical power. In addition, the jackknife estimation of squared residuals enabled more elaborate validations about the nature of individual links than the ParaFitLink1 test of the program ParaFit. In order to demonstrate how it can be used in real biological situations, we applied PACo to two published studies using a script written in the public-domain statistical software R."

https://openalex.org/W1992327054,"The histone variant H2A.Z plays key roles in gene expression, DNA repair, and centromere function. H2A.Z deposition is controlled by SWR-C chromatin remodeling enzymes that catalyze the nucleosomal exchange of canonical H2A with H2A.Z. Here we report that acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3-K56Ac) alters the substrate specificity of SWR-C, leading to promiscuous dimer exchange in which either H2A.Z or H2A can be exchanged from nucleosomes. This result was confirmed in vivo, where genome-wide analysis demonstrated widespread decreases in H2A.Z levels in yeast mutants with hyperacetylated H3K56. Our work also suggests that a conserved SWR-C subunit may function as a ""lock"" that prevents removal of H2A.Z from nucleosomes. Our study identifies a histone modification that regulates a chromatin remodeling reaction and provides insights into how histone variants and nucleosome turnover can be controlled by chromatin regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2082236311,The discovery of a relatively complete Australopithecus sediba adult female skeleton permits a detailed locomotor analysis in which joint systems can be integrated to form a comprehensive picture of gait kinematics in this late australopith. Here we describe the lower limb anatomy of Au. sediba and hypothesize that this species walked with a fully extended leg and with an inverted foot during the swing phase of bipedal walking. Initial contact of the lateral foot with the ground resulted in a large pronatory torque around the joints of the foot that caused extreme medial weight transfer (hyperpronation) into the toe-off phase of the gait cycle (late pronation). These bipedal mechanics are different from those often reconstructed for other australopiths and suggest that there may have been several forms of bipedalism during the Plio-Pleistocene.

Neither detection nor selective removal of rare latent HCMV-infected cells has been possible. Weekes et al. (p. 199 ) have found that the multidrug-resistant ABC transporter, multidrug resistance–associated protein-1 (MRP1) is down-regulated during latent HCMV infection. Consequently, cytotoxic MRP1-specific substrates are not exported from HCMV-infected cells and accumulate—leading to cell death, which could potentially provide a mechanism for eliminating infected cells prior to transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2055768796,"The evolution of the human upper limb involved a change in function from its use for both locomotion and prehension (as in apes) to a predominantly prehensile and manipulative role. Well-preserved forelimb remains of 1.98-million-year-old Australopithecus sediba from Malapa, South Africa, contribute to our understanding of this evolutionary transition. Whereas other aspects of their postcranial anatomy evince mosaic combinations of primitive (australopith-like) and derived (Homo-like) features, the upper limbs (excluding the hand and wrist) of the Malapa hominins are predominantly primitive and suggest the retention of substantial climbing and suspensory ability. The use of the forelimb primarily for prehension and manipulation appears to arise later, likely with the emergence of Homo erectus."
https://openalex.org/W1990535688,"Two partial vertebral columns of Australopithecus sediba grant insight into aspects of early hominin spinal mobility, lumbar curvature, vertebral formula, and transitional vertebra position. Au. sediba likely possessed five non–rib-bearing lumbar vertebrae and five sacral elements, the same configuration that occurs modally in modern humans. This finding contrasts with other interpretations of early hominin regional vertebral numbers. Importantly, the transitional vertebra is distinct from and above the last rib-bearing vertebra in Au. sediba , resulting in a functionally longer lower back. This configuration, along with a strongly wedged last lumbar vertebra and other indicators of lordotic posture, would have contributed to a highly flexible spine that is derived compared with earlier members of the genus Australopithecus and similar to that of the Nariokotome Homo erectus skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2001825754,"Medicinal application of many complex natural products is precluded by the impracticality of their chemical synthesis. Pactamycin, the most structurally intricate aminocyclopentitol antibiotic, displays potent antiproliferative properties across multiple phylogenetic domains, but it is highly cytotoxic. A limited number of analogs produced by genetic engineering technologies show reduced cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, renewing promise for therapeutic applications. For decades, an efficient synthesis of pactamycin amenable to analog derivatizations has eluded researchers. Here, we present a short asymmetric total synthesis of pactamycin. An enantioselective Mannich reaction and symmetry-breaking reduction sequence was designed to enable assembly of the entire carbon core skeleton in under five steps and control critical three-dimensional (stereochemical) functional group relationships. This modular route totals 15 steps and is immediately amenable for structural analog synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2005154503,"To characterize further the Australopithecus sediba hypodigm, we describe 22 dental traits in specimens MH1 and MH2. Like other skeletal elements, the teeth present a mosaic of primitive and derived features. The new nonmetric data are then qualitatively and phenetically compared with those in eight other African hominin samples, before cladistic analyses using a gorilla outgroup. There is some distinction, largely driven by contrasting molar traits, from East African australopiths. However, Au. sediba links with Au. africanus to form a South African australopith clade. These species present five apomorphies, including shared expressions of Carabelli’s upper first molar (UM1) and protostylid lower first molar (LM1). Five synapomorphies are also evident between them and monophyletic Homo habilis/rudolfensis + H. erectus . Finally, a South African australopith + Homo clade is supported by four shared derived states, including identical LM1 cusp 7 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2004768943,"Lung cancer remains a leading cause of death due to its metastasis to distant organs. We have examined the effect of honokiol, a bioactive constituent from the Magnolia plant, on human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell migration and the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect. Using an in vitro cell migration assay, we found that treatment of A549, H1299, H460 and H226 NSCLC cells with honokiol resulted in inhibition of migration of these cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with a reduction in the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, also inhibited cell migration. Honokiol inhibited PGE2-enhanced migration of NSCLC cells, inhibited the activation of NF-κB/p65, an upstream regulator of COX-2, in A549 and H1299 cells, and treatment of cells with caffeic acid phenethyl ester, an inhibitor of NF-κB, also inhibited migration of NSCLC cells. PGE2 has been shown to activate β-catenin signaling, which contributes to cancer cell migration. Therefore, we checked the effect of honokiol on β-catenin signaling. It was observed that treatment of NSCLC cells with honokiol degraded cytosolic β-catenin, reduced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and down-regulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, which are the down-stream targets of β-catenin and play a crucial role in cancer cell metastasis. Honokiol enhanced: (i) the levels of casein kinase-1α, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and (ii) phosphorylation of β-catenin on critical residues Ser45, Ser33/37 and Thr41. These events play important roles in degradation or inactivation of β-catenin. Treatment of celecoxib also reduced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in NSCLC cells. FH535, an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, inhibited PGE2-enhanced cell migration of A549 and H1299 cells. These results indicate that honokiol inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cells migration by targeting PGE2-mediated activation of β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2028630620,"The shape of the thorax of early hominins has been a point of contention for more than 30 years. Owing to the generally fragmentary nature of fossil hominin ribs, few specimens have been recovered that have rib remains complete enough to allow accurate reassembly of thoracic shape, thus leaving open the question of when the cylindrical-shaped chest of humans and their immediate ancestors evolved. The ribs of Australopithecus sediba exhibit a mediolaterally narrow, ape-like upper thoracic shape, which is unlike the broad upper thorax of Homo that has been related to the locomotor pattern of endurance walking and running. The lower thorax, however, appears less laterally flared than that of apes and more closely approximates the morphology found in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2048423613,"Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a tubulin deacetylase that regulates protein aggregation and turnover. Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) make the mutant protein prone to aggregation. However, the role of HDAC6 in mutant SOD1 aggregation and the ALS etiology is unclear. Here we report that HDAC6 knockdown increased mutant SOD1 aggregation in cultured cells. Different from its known role in mediating the degradation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, HDAC6 selectively interacted with mutant SOD1 via two motifs similar to the SOD1 mutant interaction region (SMIR) that we identified previously in p62/sequestosome 1. Expression of the aggregation-prone mutant SOD1 increased α-tubulin acetylation, and the acetylation-mimicking K40Q α-tubulin mutant promoted mutant SOD1 aggregation. Our results suggest that ALS-linked mutant SOD1 can modulate HDAC6 activity and increase tubulin acetylation, which, in turn, facilitates the microtubule- and retrograde transport-dependent mutant SOD1 aggregation. HDAC6 impairment might be a common feature in various subtypes of ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2057142459,"Since the announcement of the species Australopithecus sediba , questions have been raised over whether the Malapa fossils represent a valid taxon or whether inadequate allowance was made for intraspecific variation, in particular with reference to the temporally and geographically proximate species Au . africanus . The morphology of mandibular remains of Au. sediba , including newly recovered material discussed here, shows that it is not merely a late-surviving morph of Au. africanus . Rather—as is seen elsewhere in the cranium, dentition, and postcranial skeleton—these mandibular remains share similarities with other australopiths but can be differentiated from the hypodigm of Au. africanus in both size and shape as well as in their ontogenetic growth trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W1985688174,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are considered to be a promising cell source for regenerative medicine because of their unlimited capacity for self-renewal and differentiation. However, little is known about the innate immunity in ESCs and ESC-derived cells. We investigated the responses of mouse (m)ESCs to three types of live viruses as follows: La Crosse virus, West Nile virus, and Sendai virus. Our results demonstrated mESCs were susceptible to viral infection, but they were unable to express type I interferons (IFNα and IFNβ, IFNα/β), which differ from fibroblasts (10T1/2 cells) that robustly express IFNα/β upon viral infections. The failure of mESCs to express IFNα/β was further demonstrated by treatment with polyIC, a synthetic viral dsRNA analog that strongly induced IFNα/β in 10T1/2 cells. Although polyIC transiently inhibited the transcription of pluripotency markers, the stem cell morphology was not significantly affected. However, polyIC can induce dsRNA-activated protein kinase in mESCs, and this activation resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation. We conclude that the cytosolic receptor dsRNA-activated protein kinase is functional, but the mechanisms that mediate type I IFN expression are deficient in mESCs. This conclusion is further supported by the findings that the major viral RNA receptors are either expressed at very low levels (TLR3 and MDA5) or may not be active (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) in mESCs."
https://openalex.org/W1997711954,"Myofibroblast differentiation plays a critical role in wound healing and in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. We have previously shown that myofibroblast differentiation is mediated by the activity of serum response factor (SRF), which is tightly controlled by the actin polymerization state. In this study, we investigated the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in modulating myofibroblast phenotype. Treatment of human lung fibroblasts with the microtubule-destabilizing agent, colchicine, resulted in a formation of numerous stress fibers and expression of myofibroblast differentiation marker proteins. These effects of colchicine were independent of Smad signaling but were mediated by Rho signaling and SRF, as they were attenuated by the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632, or by the SRF inhibitor, CCG-1423. TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation was not accompanied by gross changes in the microtubule polymerization state. However, microtubule stabilization by paclitaxel attenuated TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Paclitaxel had no effect on TGF-β-induced Smad activation and Smad-dependent gene transcription but inhibited actin polymerization, nuclear accumulation of megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 protein, and SRF activation. The microtubule-associated formin, mDIA2, localized to actin stress fibers upon treatment with TGF-β, and paclitaxel prevented this localization. Treatment with the formin inhibitor, SMI formin homology 2 domain, inhibited stress fiber formation and myofibroblast differentiation induced by TGF-β, without affecting Smad-phosphorylation or microtubule polymerization. Together, these data suggest that (a) TGF-β promotes association of mDia2 with actin stress fibers, which further drives stress fiber formation and myofibroblast differentiation, and (b) microtubule polymerization state controls myofibroblast differentiation through the regulation of mDia2 localization."
https://openalex.org/W1970944914,"Although HAMLET (human α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells), a complex formed by human α-lactalbumin and oleic acid, has a unique apoptotic activity for the selective killing of tumor cells, the molecular mechanisms of expression of the HAMLET activity are not well understood. Therefore, we studied the molecular properties of HAMLET and its goat counterpart, GAMLET (goat α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells), by pulse field gradient NMR and 920-MHz two-dimensional NMR techniques. We also examined the expression of HAMLET-like activities of complexes between oleic acid and other proteins that form a stable molten globule state. We observed that both HAMLET and GAMLET at pH 7.5 were heterogeneous, composed of the native protein, the monomeric molten globule-like state, and the oligomeric species. At pH 2.0 and 50 °C, HAMLET and GAMLET appeared in the monomeric state, and we identified the oleic acid-binding site in the complexes by two-dimensional NMR. Rather surprisingly, the binding site thus identified was markedly different between HAMLET and GAMLET. Furthermore, canine milk lysozyme, apo-myoglobin, and β2-microglobulin all formed the HAMLET-like complex with the anti-tumor activity, when the protein was treated with oleic acid under conditions in which their molten globule states were stable. From these results, we conclude that the protein portion of HAMLET, GAMLET, and the other HAMLET-like protein-oleic acid complexes is not the origin of their cytotoxicity to tumor cells and that the protein portion of these complexes plays a role in the delivery of cytotoxic oleic acid molecules into tumor cells across the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2021818868,"Multifaceted structural approaches were undertaken to investigate interaction of the E2 component with E3 and E1 components from the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDHc), as a representative of the PDHc from Gram-negative bacteria. The crystal structure of E3 at 2.5 Å resolution reveals similarity to other E3 structures and was an important starting point for understanding interaction surfaces between E3 and E2. Biochemical studies revealed that R129E-E2 and R150E-E2 substitutions in the peripheral subunit-binding domain (PSBD) of E2 greatly diminished PDHc activity, affected interactions with E3 and E1 components, and affected reductive acetylation of E2. Because crystal structures are unavailable for any complete E2-containing complexes, peptide-specific hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was used to identify loci of interactions between 3-lipoyl E2 and E3. Two peptides from the PSBD, including Arg-129, and three peptides from E3 displayed statistically significant reductions in deuterium uptake resulting from interaction between E3 and E2. Of the peptides identified on E3, two were from the catalytic site, and the third was from the interface domain, which for all known E3 structures is believed to interact with the PSBD. NMR clearly demonstrates that there is no change in the lipoyl domain structure on complexation with E3. This is the first instance where the entire wild-type E2 component was employed to understand interactions with E3. A model for PSBD-E3 binding was independently constructed and found to be consistent with the importance of Arg-129, as well as revealing other electrostatic interactions likely stabilizing this complex."
https://openalex.org/W1993596962,"We found previously that dipeptide YL exhibits orally active anxiolytic activity comparable to diazepam. The YL sequence is often observed in the primary structure of natural food proteins. In the present study, we investigated whether YL and YL analogues are released from bovine αS-casein by gastrointestinal proteases. YLG, corresponding to αS1-casein (aa 91-93), was more effectively released from αS-casein than YL by pepsin-pancreatin digestion, mimicking gastrointestinal enzymatic conditions. Using the synthetic model peptide, we determined that trypsin cleaved the N terminus of YLG, and elastase and carboxypeptidase contributed to cleave the C-terminus. YLG exhibited orally active anxiolytic-like activity in the elevated plus maze and open-field tests in mice. The anxiolytic-like activity of YLG was inhibited by WAY100135, SCH23390 or bicuculline, antagonists of serotonin 5-HT1A, dopamine D1, and GABA(A) receptors, respectively; however, YLG had no affinity for these receptors. The pepsin-pancreatin digest of αS-Casein also exhibited anxiolytic-like activity. Meanwhile, anxiolytic-like activity of α-casozepine, an αS1-casein-derived decapeptide with YL sequence in the N terminus, was blocked by WAY100135, SCH23390, or bicuculline, equally to YLG and YL; however, it was not detected in the pepsin-pancreatic digest. Taken together, we found that YLG is released after pepsin-pancreatic digestion of αS-casein and exhibits potent anxiolytic-like activity via activation of serotonin, dopamine, and the GABA receptor system."

Here, we report the structure of JMB19063 in complex with glucose and the catalytic variant D261N crystallized in the presence of cellopentaose. JMB19063 is first structure of a dimeric member of the GH3 family, and we demonstrate that dimerization is required for catalytic activity. Arg-587 and Phe-598 from the C-terminal domain of the opposing monomer are shown to interact with bound ligands in the D261N structure. Enzyme assays confirmed that these residues are absolutely essential for full catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2049379761,"The rumen bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens produces a highly organized multienzyme cellulosome complex that plays a key role in the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides, notably cellulose. The R. flavefaciens cellulosomal system is anchored to the bacterial cell wall through a relatively small ScaE scaffoldin subunit, which bears a single type IIIe cohesin responsible for the attachment of two major dockerin-containing scaffoldin proteins, ScaB and the cellulose-binding protein CttA. Although ScaB recruits the catalytic machinery onto the complex, CttA mediates attachment of the bacterial substrate via its two putative carbohydrate-binding modules. In an effort to understand the structural basis for assembly and cell surface attachment of the cellulosome in R. flavefaciens, we determined the crystal structure of the high affinity complex (Kd = 20.83 nM) between the cohesin module of ScaE (CohE) and its cognate X-dockerin (XDoc) modular dyad from CttA at 1.97-Å resolution. The structure reveals an atypical calcium-binding loop containing a 13-residue insert. The results further pinpoint two charged specificity-related residues on the surface of the cohesin module that are responsible for specific versus promiscuous cross-strain binding of the dockerin module. In addition, a combined functional role for the three enigmatic dockerin inserts was established whereby these extraneous segments serve as structural buttresses that reinforce the stalklike conformation of the X-module, thus segregating its tethered complement of cellulosomal components from the cell surface. The novel structure of the RfCohE-XDoc complex sheds light on divergent dockerin structure and function and provides insight into the specificity features of the type IIIe cohesin-dockerin interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2120604573,"Aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling has been described in a growing number of cancers, including malignant lymphomas. Here, we report that canonical Hedgehog signaling modulates the transcriptional expression of AKT genes and that AKT1 is a direct transcriptional target of GLI1. We identified two putative binding sites for GLI1 in the AKT1 promoter region and confirmed their functionality using chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter, and site-directed mutagenesis assays. Moreover, we provide evidence that GLI1 contributes to the survival of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells and that this effect occurs in part through promotion of the transcription of AKT genes. This finding is of interest as constitutive activation of AKT has been described in DLBCL, but causative factors that explain AKT expression in this lymphoma type are not completely known. In summary, we demonstrated the existence of a novel cross-talk at the transcriptional level between Hedgehog signaling and AKT with biological significance in DLBCL."
https://openalex.org/W2159316931,"Oct4 is a member of the POU family of transcription factors and plays a critical role in both maintenance of the undifferentiated state of embryonic stem (ES) cells and in the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. Oct4 is imported into the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor; however, the spatiotemporal dynamic behavior of Oct4 remains largely unknown. In the present study we show that Oct4 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. Furthermore, although Oct4 mutants with altered nuclear import/export activity were able to maintain the self-renewal of ES cells, they displayed limited potential for cellular reprogramming. These results indicate that the intracellular localization of Oct4, which is dependent on nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, must be more strictly regulated for cellular reprogramming, suggesting that Oct4 plays differential roles in the self-renewal of ES cells and in somatic cell reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2039383268,"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is a major cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. The discovery in 1990 that a point mutation at residue 403 (R403Q) in the β-myosin heavy chain (MHC) caused a severe form of FHC was the first of many demonstrations linking FHC to mutations in muscle proteins. A mouse model for FHC has been widely used to study the mechanochemical properties of mutated cardiac myosin, but mouse hearts express α-MHC, whereas the ventricles of larger mammals express predominantly β-MHC. To address the role of the isoform backbone on function, we generated a transgenic mouse in which the endogenous α-MHC was partially replaced with transgenically encoded β-MHC or α-MHC. A His6 tag was cloned at the N terminus, along with R403Q, to facilitate isolation of myosin subfragment 1 (S1). Stopped flow kinetics were used to measure the equilibrium constants and rates of nucleotide binding and release for the mouse S1 isoforms bound to actin. For the wild-type isoforms, we found that the affinity of MgADP for α-S1 (100 μM) is ~ 4-fold weaker than for β-S1 (25 μM). Correspondingly, the MgADP release rate for α-S1 (350 s(-1)) is ~3-fold greater than for β-S1 (120 s(-1)). Introducing the R403Q mutation caused only a minor reduction in kinetics for β-S1, but R403Q in α-S1 caused the ADP release rate to increase by 20% (430 s(-1)). These transient kinetic studies on mouse cardiac myosins provide strong evidence that the functional impact of an FHC mutation on myosin depends on the isoform backbone."
https://openalex.org/W1985720189,"Soluble low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (sLRP1) binds ∼70% of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in human plasma. In Alzheimer disease (AD) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment converting to AD, plasma sLRP1 levels are reduced and sLRP1 is oxidized, which results in diminished Aβ peripheral binding and higher levels of free Aβ in plasma. Experimental studies have shown that free circulating Aβ re-enters the brain and that sLRP1 and/or its recombinant wild type cluster IV (WT-LRPIV) prevent Aβ from entering the brain. Treatment of Alzheimer APPsw+/0 mice with WT-LRPIV has been shown to reduce brain Aβ pathology. In addition to Aβ, LRPIV binds multiple ligands. To enhance LRPIV binding for Aβ relative to other LRP1 ligands, we generated a library of LRPIV-derived fragments and full-length LRPIV variants with glycine replacing aspartic acid residues 3394, 3556, and 3674 in the calcium binding sites. Compared with WT-LRPIV, a lead LRPIV-D3674G mutant had 1.6- and 2.7-fold higher binding affinity for Aβ40 and Aβ42 in vitro, respectively, and a lower binding affinity for other LRP1 ligands (e.g. apolipoprotein E2, E3, and E4 (1.3–1.8-fold), tissue plasminogen activator (2.7-fold), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (4.1-fold), and Factor Xa (3.8-fold)). LRPIV-D3674G cleared mouse endogenous brain Aβ40 and Aβ42 25–27% better than WT-LRPIV. A 3-month subcutaneous treatment of APPsw+/0 mice with LRPIV-D3674G (40 μg/kg/day) reduced Aβ40 and Αβ42 levels in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebrospinal fluid by 60–80% and improved cerebral blood flow responses and hippocampal function at 9 months of age. Thus, LRPIV-D3674G is an efficient new Aβ clearance therapy.Background: Wild type LRP1 cluster IV (WT-LRPIV) binds plasma Aβ and reduces Aβ-related pathology in APPsw+/0 mice.Results: A novel LRPIV-D3674G mutant binds Aβ with a higher affinity than WT-LRPIV and clears brain Aβ better than WT-LRPIV. LRPIV-D3674G reduces effectively Aβ pathology in APPsw+/0 mice.Conclusion: LRPIV-D3674G is an efficient Aβ clearance agent.Significance: Aβ clearance therapy is critical for treatment of Alzheimer disease. Soluble low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (sLRP1) binds ∼70% of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in human plasma. In Alzheimer disease (AD) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment converting to AD, plasma sLRP1 levels are reduced and sLRP1 is oxidized, which results in diminished Aβ peripheral binding and higher levels of free Aβ in plasma. Experimental studies have shown that free circulating Aβ re-enters the brain and that sLRP1 and/or its recombinant wild type cluster IV (WT-LRPIV) prevent Aβ from entering the brain.

Aβ antibodies that act principally by sequestering the peripheral Aβ pool do not cross the BBB and are generally thought to clear Aβ from the brain by the so-called “peripheral sink” mechanism through binding of peripheral Aβ, which according to some studies lessens the risk of potential central side effects of the antibody clearance therapy, such as neuroinflammation, vasogenic edema, and cerebral microhemorrhages (27Pfeifer M.

Protein folding and calcium binding defects arising from familial hypercholesterolemia mutations of the LDL receptor.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In an attempt to enhance Aβ binding to LRPIV and improve its Aβ-clearing properties, we generated a library of recombinant LRPIV fragments and full-length LRPIV variants with single glycine replacement with an aspartic acid residue in the calcium binding site in either CR 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, or 29. We expressed these LRPIV analogs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Next, LRP-IV-derived analogs that have been well secreted by CHO cells into the medium were purified, and their binding affinity for Aβ40 and Aβ42 and other LRP1 ligands, including apolipoprotein E2-4 (apoE2-4), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and Factor IXa, was determined. A lead LRPIV-D3674G mutant had the highest in vitro binding affinity for Aβ peptides relative to other ligands and cleared mouse endogenous Aβ more efficiently than WT-LRPIV. Moreover, subcutaneous LRPIV-D3674G treatment significantly reduced Aβ levels in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in Alzheimer APPsw+/0 mice and improved cerebral blood flow responses and hippocampal function. Our findings suggest that LRPIV-D3674G is an efficient new Aβ clearance therapy for AD. Human Aβ40 and Aβ42 were synthesized at the W. M.

LRP1 cDNA was synthesized from human spleen total RNA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen). Primers were designed based on LRP1 sequence (NM_002332) (Table 1). LRPIV (Fig. 1A) was amplified from cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfx-DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and their respective primer sets and cloned into pcDNA3.3 TOPO vector. Using this construct, full-length LRPIV consisting of 11 CRs (CR21–CR31), two four-repeat fragments (CR24–CR27 and CR25–CR28), one three-repeat fragment (CR25–CR27), two two-repeat fragments (CR25-CR26 and CR26-CR27), and two single-repeat fragments (CR25 and CR26) (Fig. 1A) were amplified using PCR and cloned in mammalian expression vector pSecTag2 B (Invitrogen) between HindIII and BamHI restriction sites to express soluble proteins. pSecTag2 B vector has the IgK leader peptide on the N terminus and a Myc tag and His6 tag on the C terminus. In addition, a full-length LRPIV was amplified using 129 bp of forward primer (which has Kozak sequence, start codon, tPA signal peptide sequence, and LRPIV sequence) and reverse primer with the HindIII restriction site and cloned into pcDNA3.3 TOPO vector (WT-LRPIV).

STAT1 is activated through phosphorylation on its tyrosine 701 by JAKs and is inactivated through dephosphorylation by tyrosine phosphatases. We discovered a natural compound, wedelolactone, that increased IFN-γ signaling by inhibiting STAT1 dephosphorylation and prolonging STAT1 activation through specific inhibition of T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), an important tyrosine phosphatase for STAT1 dephosphorylation. More interestingly, wedelolactone inhibited TCPTP through interaction with the C-terminal autoinhibition domain of TCPTP. We also found that wedelolactone synergized with IFN-γ to induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Our data suggest a new target for anticancer or antiproliferation drugs, a new mechanism to regulate PTPs specifically, and a new drug candidate for treating cancer or other proliferation disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2128728743,"HTRA1 is a highly conserved serine protease which has been implicated in suppression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and cell motility in breast cancer. Its prognostic relevance for breast cancer is unclear so far. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of HTRA1 mRNA expression on patient outcome using a cohort of 131 breast cancer patients as well as a validation cohort including 2809 publically available data sets. Additionally, we aimed at investigating for the presence of promoter hypermethylation as a mechanism for silencing the HTRA1 gene in breast tumors. HTRA1 downregulation was detected in more than 50% of the breast cancer specimens and was associated with higher tumor stage (p = 0.025). By applying Cox proportional hazard models, we observed favorable overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) related to high HTRA1 expression (HR = 0.45 [CI 0.23-0.90], p = 0.023; HR = 0.55 [CI 0.32-0.94], p = 0.028, respectively), with even more pronounced impact in node-positive patients (HR = 0.21 [CI 0.07-0.63], p = 0.006; HR = 0.29 [CI 0.13-0.65], p = 0.002, respectively). Moreover, HTRA1 remained a statistically significant factor predicting DFS among established clinical parameters in the multivariable analysis. Its impact on patient outcome was independently confirmed in the validation set (for relapse-free survival (n = 2809): HR = 0.79 [CI 0.7-0.9], log-rank p = 0.0003; for OS (n = 971): HR = 0.63 [CI 0.48-0.83], log-rank p = 0.0009). In promoter analyses, we in fact detected methylation of HTRA1 in a small subset of breast cancer specimens (two out of a series of 12), and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells which exhibited 22-fold lower HTRA1 mRNA expression levels compared to unmethylated MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, we show that downregulation of HTRA1 is associated with shorter patient survival, particularly in node-positive breast cancer. Since HTRA1 loss was demonstrated to induce EMT and cancer cell invasion, these patients might benefit from demethylating agents or histone deacetylase inhibitors previously reported to lead to HTRA1 upregulation, or from novel small-molecule inhibitors targeting EMT-related processes."
https://openalex.org/W2144946280,"The Oct1 transcription factor is a potent regulator of stress responses, metabolism, and tumorigenicity. Although Oct1 is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, the presence and importance of other modifications is unknown. Here we show that Oct1 is modified by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) moieties. We map two sites of O-GlcNAcylation at positions T255 and S728 within human Oct1. Under anchorage-independent overgrowth conditions, Oct1 associates 3-fold more strongly with the Gadd45a promoter and mediates transcriptional repression. Increased binding correlates with quantitative reductions in Oct1 nuclear periphery-associated puncta, and a reduced association with lamin B1. The O-GlcNAc modification sites are important for both Gadd45a repression and anchorage-independent survival. In contrast to chronic overgrowth conditions, following acute nutrient starvation Oct1 mediates Gadd45a activation. The O-GlcNAc sites are also important for Gadd45a activation under these conditions. We also, for the first time, identify specific Oct1 ubiquitination sites. The findings suggest that Oct1 integrates metabolic and stress signals via O-GlcNAc modification to regulate target gene activity."
https://openalex.org/W2028079081,"Rrp6 is a key catalytic subunit of the nuclear RNA exosome that plays a pivotal role in the processing, degradation, and quality control of a wide range of cellular RNAs. Here we report our findings on the assembly of the complex involving Rrp6 and its associated protein Rrp47, which is required for many Rrp6-mediated RNA processes. Recombinant Rrp47 is expressed as a non-globular homodimer. Analysis of the purified recombinant Rrp6·Rrp47 complex revealed a heterodimer, suggesting that Rrp47 undergoes a structural reconfiguration upon interaction with Rrp6. Studies using GFP fusion proteins show that Rrp6 and Rrp47 are localized to the yeast cell nucleus independently of one another. Consistent with this data, Rrp6, but not Rrp47, is found associated with the nuclear import adaptor protein Srp1. We show that the interaction with Rrp6 is critical for Rrp47 stability in vivo; in the absence of Rrp6, newly synthesized Rrp47 is rapidly degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. These data resolve independent nuclear import routes for Rrp6 and Rrp47, reveal a structural reorganization of Rrp47 upon its interaction with Rrp6, and demonstrate a proteasome-dependent mechanism that efficiently suppresses the expression of Rrp47 in the absence of Rrp6."

The interaction of Hsp40s with native proteins modifies their structure and function. A good model for this function is DnaJ, the bacterial Hsp40 that interacts with RepE, the repressor/activator of plasmid F replication, and together with DnaK regulates its function. We characterize here the structure of the DnaJ-RepE complex by electron microscopy, the first described structure of a complex between an Hsp40 and a client protein. The comparison of the complexes of DnaJ with two RepE mutants reveals an intrinsic plasticity of the DnaJ dimer that allows the chaperone to adapt to different substrates. We also show that DnaJ induces conformational changes in dimeric RepE, which increase the intermonomeric distance and remodel both RepE domains enhancing its affinity for DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2085985952,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays key roles in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Dapper3/Dact3, one of the three members of the Dapper gene family, is transcriptionally repressed in colorectal cancer and may function as a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To investigate its physiological functions, we generated a mouse strain harboring conditional null alleles of Dapper3 (Dapper3(flox/flox)), and homozygous Dapper3-deficient (Dapper3(-/-)) mice were produced after crossing with EIIa-cre transgenic mice. We found that Dapper3 is not essential for mouse embryogenesis, postnatal survival, and reproduction. However, adult Dapper3(-/-) mice exhibited a mild reduction in body weight compared with their wild-type littermates, suggesting a functional role of Dapper3 in postnatal growth. To investigate the role of Dapper3 in renal fibrosis, we employed the unilateral ureteral obstruction model. Dapper3 mRNA expression was up-regulated in kidney after unilateral ureteral obstruction. Loss of the Dapper3 gene enhanced myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix overproduction in the obstructed kidney. Moreover, this aggravated fibrotic phenotype was accompanied with accumulation of Dishevelled2 and β-catenin proteins and activation of Wnt-targeted fibrotic genes. In primary renal tubular cells, Dapper3 inhibits Wnt-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Consistently, Dapper3 interacted with and down-regulated Dishevelled2 protein and attenuated the Wnt-responsive Topflash reporter expression. These findings together suggest that Dapper3 antagonizes the fibrotic actions of Wnt signaling in kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2074688068,"Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor for the coagulant protease thrombin. Thrombin binds to and cleaves the N terminus of PAR1, generating a new N terminus that functions as a tethered ligand that cannot diffuse away. In addition to rapid desensitization, PAR1 trafficking is critical for the regulation of cellular responses. PAR1 displays constitutive and agonist-induced internalization. Constitutive internalization of unactivated PAR1 is mediated by the clathrin adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2), which binds to a distal tyrosine-based motif localized within the C-terminal tail (C-tail) domain. Once internalized, PAR1 is sorted from endosomes to lysosomes via AP-3 interaction with a second C-tail tyrosine motif proximal to the transmembrane domain. However, the regulatory processes that control adaptor protein recognition of PAR1 C-tail tyrosine-based motifs are not known. Here, we report that palmitoylation of PAR1 is critical for regulating proper utilization of tyrosine-based motifs and endocytic sorting. We show that PAR1 is basally palmitoylated at highly conserved C-tail cysteines. A palmitoylation-deficient PAR1 mutant is competent to signal and exhibits a marked increase in constitutive internalization and lysosomal degradation compared with wild type receptor. Intriguingly, enhanced constitutive internalization of PAR1 is mediated by AP-2 and requires the proximal tyrosine-based motif rather than the distal tyrosine motif used by wild type receptor. Moreover, palmitoylation-deficient PAR1 displays increased degradation that is mediated by AP-3. These findings suggest that palmitoylation of PAR1 regulates appropriate utilization of tyrosine-based motifs by adaptor proteins and endocytic trafficking, processes that are critical for maintaining appropriate expression of PAR1 at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2016509969,"The 6-phospho-β-glucosidase BglA-2 (EC 3.2.1.86) from glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH-1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-1,4-linked cellobiose 6-phosphate (cellobiose-6'P) to yield glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. Both reaction products are further metabolized by the energy-generating glycolytic pathway. Here, we present the first crystal structures of the apo and complex forms of BglA-2 with thiocellobiose-6'P (a non-metabolizable analog of cellobiose-6'P) at 2.0 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively. Similar to other GH-1 enzymes, the overall structure of BglA-2 from Streptococcus pneumoniae adopts a typical (β/α)8 TIM-barrel, with the active site located at the center of the convex surface of the β-barrel. Structural analyses, in combination with enzymatic data obtained from site-directed mutant proteins, suggest that three aromatic residues, Tyr(126), Tyr(303), and Trp(338), at subsite +1 of BglA-2 determine substrate specificity with respect to 1,4-linked 6-phospho-β-glucosides. Moreover, three additional residues, Ser(424), Lys(430), and Tyr(432) of BglA-2, were found to play important roles in the hydrolytic selectivity toward phosphorylated rather than non-phosphorylated compounds. Comparative structural analysis suggests that a tryptophan versus a methionine/alanine residue at subsite -1 may contribute to the catalytic and substrate selectivity with respect to structurally similar 6-phospho-β-galactosidases and 6-phospho-β-glucosidases assigned to the GH-1 family."
https://openalex.org/W2048918671,"Vascular bubble formation after decompression contributes to endothelial injuries which form the basis for the development of decompression sickness (DCS). Nitric oxide (NO) is a powerful vasodilator that contributes to vessel homeostasis. It has been shown that NO-releasing agent may reduce bubble formation and prevent serious decompression sickness. The use of sildenafil, a well-known, phosphodiesterase-5 blocker, which act by potentiating the vasodilatory effect on smooth muscle relaxation, has never been studied in DCS. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical effects of sildenafil pre-treatment on DCS in a rat model. 67 rats were subjected to a simulated dive at 90 msw for 45 min before staged decompression. The experimental group received 10 mg/kg of sildenafil one hour before exposure (n = 35) while controls were not treated (n = 32). Clinical assessment took place over a period of 30 min after surfacing. At the end, blood samples were collected for blood cells counts and the level of circulating bubbles in the right cavities was quantified. There were significantly more manifestations of DCS in the sildenafil group than in the controls (34.3% vs 6.25%, respectively, p = 0.012). Platelet count was more reduced in treated rats than in controls (−21.7% vs −7%, respectively, p = 0.029), whereas bubble grades did not differ between groups. We concluded that pre-treatment with sildenafil promotes the onset and severity of neurological DCS. When considering the use of phosphodiesterase-5 blockers in the context of diving, careful discussion with physician should be recommended."

https://openalex.org/W2004505070,"Protein S (PS) is a multifunctional plasma protein of the hemostatic and inflammatory pathways, although mechanisms for its regulation are poorly understood. Since certain plasma proteins are regulated through extracellular phosphorylation, we investigated whether the anticoagulant activity of PS is regulated through phosphorylation by platelet-secreted kinases. PS was phosphorylated on exposure to activated platelets or their releasates, as judged by immunoblotting for phospho-amino acids and PS. PS phosphorylation was reduced by specific inhibitors of casein kinase 1 (CK1) and casein kinase 2 (CK2) (10 μM D4476, 100 μM CK2-inhibitory peptide YNLKSKSSEDIDESS). Involvement of CKs in PS phosphorylation was confirmed using purified CK1/CK2. Phosphorylation of PS by purified CK1 did not affect its activated protein C (APC) cofactor activity in activated partial thromboplastin time assays in PS-depleted plasma. However, phosphorylation of PS by CK2 or by CK1/CK2 increased PS cofactor activity ~1.5-fold (158.7±4.8%, P<0.01) or ~2-fold (191.5±6.4%, P<0.0001), respectively. The APC cofactor activity of PS in PS-depleted plasma exposed to platelet-secreted kinases was enhanced, while CK2 but not CK1 inhibitors reduced APC cofactor activity. Mass spectrometry revealed a phosphorylated CK2 site at Thr37 within the N-terminal Gla-domain. Thus, platelet-mediated extracellular phosphorylation of PS is a potential mechanism by which its activity is regulated.—Stavenuiter, F., Gale, A. J., Heeb, M. J.

Of 41 trials, cell aggregation resembling nascent ESC colony from inner cell mass was detected in 9 cases (22%), and 6 cases (67%) yielded fibroblast-derived colonies with ESC morphology. Cells used in coculture provided the critical (P=0.0061) inducing factor for the aggregation. These colony-forming fibroblasts (CFFs) showed similar characteristics to those in ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), including pluripotency gene expression, in vitro differentiation, and teratoma formation. Furthermore, CFFs produced somatic chimera, although none showed germline chimerism. CFFs had a tetraploid-like karyotype, and their imprinting patterns differed from parthenogenetic ESCs, thereby confirming their nongermline transmissibility. We observed dysregulation of cell cycle-related proteins, as well as both homologous and heterologous recombination of genomic single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CFFs. Our observations provide information on somatic cell plasticity, resulting in stemness or tumorigenesis, regardless of colony-forming cell progenitors in the fibroblast population.

Caspase-14 is proteolytically activated to mediate filaggrin processing during keratinocyte differentiation. Interestingly, altered expression of nonactivated caspase-14 proenzyme is associated with tumorigenesis and diabetic retinopathy, suggesting that caspase-14 may perform physiological functions independently of its protease activity. Here, we performed tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry analysis to identify caspase-14 proenzyme as a GCM1-interacting protein that suppresses GCM1 activity and syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. Immunohistochemistry revealed that caspase-14 and GCM1 colocalize to placental cytotrophoblast cells at 8 wk of gestation and syncytiotrophoblast layer at term. Further, we demonstrated that caspase-14 mRNA level is decreased by 40% in placental BeWo cells treated with forskolin (FSK). To the contrary, stimulation of GCM1-regulated placental cell fusion and human chorionic gonadotropin β (hCGβ) expression by FSK is enhanced by caspase-14 knockdown. Indeed, GCM1 protein level is increased by 40% in the caspase-14-knockdown BeWo cells. Because GCM1 is stabilized by acetylation, we subsequently showed that caspase-14 impedes the interaction between GCM1 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) to suppress CBP-mediated acetylation and transcriptional coactivation of GCM1. Therefore, caspase-14 can suppress placental cell differentiation through down-regulation of GCM1 activity."

In the present study, we investigate whether this channel participates in reactions of the thoracic aorta to severe acidosis and whether it plays a role in hypertension. We measured isometric contraction in thoracic aorta rings from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar rats. Severe acidosis induced contractions of both endothelium-intact and -denuded thoracic aorta rings. In Wistar rats, contractions did not differ at pH 6.4, 5.4 and 4.4. However, in SHRs, contractions were higher at pH 5.4 or 4.4 than pH 6.4, with no difference between contractions at pH 5.4 and 4.4. Nifedipine, ICl,acid blockers 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) inhibited severe acidosis-induced contraction of aortas at different pH levels. When blocking ICl,acid, the remnant contraction was greater at pH 4.4 than pH 5.4 and 6.4 for both SHRs and Wistar rats. With nifedipine, the remnant contraction was greatly reduced at pH 4.4 as compared with at pH 6.4 and 5.4. With NPPB or DIDS, the ratio of remnant contractions at pH 4.4 and 5.4 (R4.4/5.4) was lower for SHRs than Wistar rats (all <1). However, with nifedipine, the R4.4/5.4 was higher for SHRs than Wistar rats (both >1).

However, little is known about the role of p15INK4b and p57KIP2 in the pathogenesis of vulvar carcinoma, and the prognostic impact is still unknown. In our current study, we examined the expression of p15INK4b and p57KIP2 in a large series of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas to elucidate the prognostic impact. Methods Expression of p15INK4b and p57KIP2 were examined in 297 vulvar squamous cell carcinomas using immunohistochemistry. Both uni- and multivariate analysis of prognostic factors were performed, and correlations with clinicopathologic parameters were examined. Results Compared to the high levels of p15INK4b and p57KIP2 in normal vulvar squamous epithelium, low levels of p15INK4b and p57KIP2 were found in 82% and 44% of vulvar carcinomas, respectively. Low levels of p15INK4b and p57KIP2 correlated significantly with malignant features, including large tumor diameter (p = 0.03 and p = 0.001, respectively) and increased invasiveness (p = 0.003 and p = 0.04, respectively). Although p15INK4b and p57KIP2 levels could not be identified as prognostic markers, combined analysis of p14ARF/p15INK4b/p16INK4a showed that patients whose tumors expressed low levels of two or three of these INK4 proteins had a worse prognosis than those with only low levels of one or no protein (univariate analysis p = 0.02). The independent prognostic significance of these INK4 proteins was confirmed by multivariate analysis (p = 0.008). Conclusions We show for the first time that p15INK4b and p57KIP2 may be involved in the progression of vulvar carcinomas and the combined p14ARF/p15INK4b/p16INK4a status was a statistically independent prognostic factor."
https://openalex.org/W2045474674,"The autosomal recessive mutation, sld, attenuates mucous cell expression in murine sublingual glands with corresponding effects on mucin 19 (Muc19). We conducted a systematic study including genetic mapping, sequencing, and functional analyses to elucidate a mutation to explain the sld phenotype in neonatal mice. Genetic mapping and gene expression analyses localized the sld mutation within the gene Muc19/Smgc, specifically attenuating Muc19 transcripts, and Muc19 knock-out mice mimic the sld phenotype in neonates. Muc19 transcription is unaffected in sld mice, whereas mRNA stability is markedly decreased. Decreased mRNA stability is not due to a defect in 3'-end processing nor to sequence differences in Muc19 transcripts. Comparative sequencing of the Muc19/Smgc gene identified four candidate intronic mutations within the Muc19 coding region. Minigene splicing assays revealed a novel splicing event in which insertion of two additional repeats within a CA repeat region of intron 53 of the sld genome enhances retention of intron 54, decreasing the levels of correctly spliced transcripts. Moreover, pateamine A, an inhibitor of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, inhibits degradation of aberrant Muc19 transcripts. The mutation in intron 53 thus enhances aberrant splicing leading to degradation of aberrant transcripts and decreased Muc19 message stability, consistent with the sld phenotype. We propose a working model of the unique splicing event enhanced by the mutation, as well as putative explanations for the gradual but limited increase in Muc19 glycoprotein expression and its restricted localization to subpopulations of mucous cells in sld mice during postnatal gland development."
