This is in agreement with laboratory studies of anoxic marine sediments sealed in jars, which indicate that methane production does not occur until dissolved sulfate is totally exhausted. Upward diffusion of methane or its production in sulfate-free microenvironments, or both, can explain the observed coexistence of measurable concentrations of methane and sulfate in the upper portions of anoxic sediments."

Besides the delineation of natural systems and the achievement of economy of memory and ease of manipulation, the primary purpose of classification is the description of the structure and relationship of groups of similar objects. Successful classifications generate scientific hypotheses, although much classificatory work has applied, practical goals. The acceptance of polythetic taxa is a major conceptual advance and has directly led to classifications based on many, equally weighted characteristics. The specification of data for classification by computer will enhance objectivity but not eliminate cultural and subjective biases. Techniques of classification include cluster analysis and ordination, and numerous ways of representing classifications have been elaborated recently. By the application of graph theory to some classificatory problems it has been possible to reconstruct evolutionary branching sequences. Computer classification has been successfully applied across a broad range of disciplines."

This effect follows the release of chlorine from these compounds in the stratosphere. Present usage levels of chlorofluoromethanes can lead to chlorine-catalyzed ozone destruction rates that will exceed natural sinks of ozone by 1985 or 1990.

https://openalex.org/W2015202788,Direct views of electron clouds in atoms have been observed visually and photographed by means of a two-stage holographic microscope based on Gabor's principle of image reconstruction. Holograms are produced with 40-kilovolt electron radiation and decoded with an optical laser. The obviation of an objective lens makes feasible a numerical aperture of 0.37 and a resolving power exceeding 0.1 angstrom.

https://openalex.org/W2021871582,"Multiple precipitin formation may be induced in the rabbit by the successive introduction of different antigens, and many precipitins may exist simultaneously in the blood for some time. Precipitins no longer demonstrable in the blood of a rabbit subjected to multiple successive immunization may reappear on the injection of only one of the antigens previously injected. Whether an unused antigen would have the same effect has not been determined."

https://openalex.org/W2011288675,Recent international conferences have indicated the sharp division that exists between developing countries and the Western industrialized countries especially the U.S. The rhetoric of developing and socialist countries has shifted in the past 20 years from a simple anticolonialism to attacks on Western political and economic exploitation. These nations are now calling for a new international economic order. The oil crisis has divided the Third World into rich oil countries and poor countries. The World Population Conference in Bucharest showed this division: Asian countries such as India and Indonesia supported population control whereas certain South American countries African states Russia and China indicated that capitalism not population was the major problem.
