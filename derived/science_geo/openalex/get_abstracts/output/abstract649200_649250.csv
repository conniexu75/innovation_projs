These membrane protein complexes possess numerous subunit isoforms, which complicates their analysis. We isolated homogeneous rat brain V-ATPase through its interaction with SidK, a Legionella pneumophila effector protein. Cryo-electron microscopy allowed the construction of an atomic model, defining the enzyme's ATP:proton ratio as 3:10 and revealing a homolog of yeast subunit f in the membrane region, which we tentatively identify as RNAseK. The c ring encloses the transmembrane anchors for cleaved ATP6AP1/Ac45 and ATP6AP2/PRR, the latter of which is the (pro)renin receptor that, in other contexts, is involved in both Wnt signaling and the renin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure. This structure shows how ATP6AP1/Ac45 and ATP6AP2/PRR enable assembly of the enzyme's catalytic and membrane regions."

Cells nearing the body surface suddenly lose their organelles, becoming dead cellular ghosts called squames. Working in mouse tissue, Garcia Quiroz et al. found that as differentiation-specific proteins accumulate in the keratinocytes, they undergo a vinegar-in-oil type of phase separation that crowds the cytoplasm with increasingly viscous protein droplets (see the Perspective by Rai and Pelkmans). Upon approaching the acidic skin surface, the environmentally sensitive liquid-like droplets respond and dissipate, driving squame formation. These dynamics come into play in human skin barrier diseases, where mutations cause maladapted liquid-phase transitions. Science , this issue p. eaax9554 ; see also p. 1193"

How these changes occur and what maintains this altered synaptic composition so that memory can persist are unknown. Hervas et al. report the structure of a synaptic translation regulator called Orb2 isolated from the brains of adult fruit flies that is important for the maintenance and recall of memory. Orb2 forms an amyloid and changes its activity from a translation repressor to an activator. The amyloid core is composed of polar hydrophilic residues, as opposed to the hydrophobic ones found in nonfunctional or pathological amyloids. The structure provides insights into how amyloids could be a stable yet malleable substrate of memory. Science , this issue p. 1230"

The nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko exhibits an unidentified broad spectral reflectance feature around 3.2 micrometers, which is ubiquitous across its surface. On the basis of laboratory experiments, we attribute this absorption band to ammonium salts mixed with dust on the surface. The depth of the band indicates that semivolatile ammonium salts are a substantial reservoir of nitrogen in the comet, potentially dominating over refractory organic matter and more volatile species. Similar absorption features appear in the spectra of some asteroids, implying a compositional link between asteroids, comets, and the parent interstellar cloud."
https://openalex.org/W3099004874,"Spin-orbit coupling has proven indispensable in realizing topological materials and more recently Ising pairing in two-dimensional superconductors. This pairing mechanism relies on inversion symmetry breaking and sustains anomalously large in-plane polarizing magnetic fields whose upper limit is expected to diverge at low temperatures, although experimental demonstration of this has remained elusive due to the required fields. In this work, the recently discovered superconductor few-layer stanene, i.e. epitaxially strained $\alpha$-Sn, is shown to exhibit a new type of Ising pairing between carriers residing in bands with different orbital indices near the $\Gamma$-point. The bands are split as a result of spin-orbit locking without the participation of inversion symmetry breaking. The in-plane upper critical field is strongly enhanced at ultra-low temperature and reveals the sought for upturn."
https://openalex.org/W3011727833,"Although the ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolateral area (VMHvl) is now well established as a critical locus for the generation of conspecific aggression, its role is complex, with neurons responding during multiple phases of social interactions with both males and females. It has been previously unclear how the brain uses this complex multidimensional signal and coordinates a discrete action: the attack. Here, we find a hypothalamic-midbrain circuit that represents hierarchically organized social signals during aggression. Optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping reveals a preferential projection from VMHvlvGlut2 to lPAGvGlut2 cells, and inactivation of downstream lPAGvGlut2 populations results in aggression-specific deficits. lPAG neurons are selective for attack action and exhibit short-latency, time-locked spiking relative to the activity of jaw muscles during biting. Last, we find that this projection conveys male-biased signals from the VMHvl to downstream lPAGvGlut2 neurons that are sensitive to features of ongoing activity, suggesting that action selectivity is generated by a combination of pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms."

Atypical intrinsic neural timescale in autism.eLife. 2019; 8: e42256Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), yet our models of the underlying information processing have remained phenomenological. What are the computations that integrate past and present information within the hierarchical networks of our brains? How is past and present information represented within each stage of processing and then passed on to higher stages? We set out to answer these questions using a combined empirical and modeling approach. To investigate how information is integrated over time, prior studies have measured the “processing timescales” of different brain regions. Processing timescales were quantified by comparing a brain region’s response to a stimulus at time t across various contexts, where the stimulus properties at time (t − τ) were altered. For example, Lerner et al., 2011Lerner Y. Honey C.J. Silbert L.J. Hasson U. Topographic mapping of a hierarchy of temporal receptive windows using a narrated story.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2906-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the neural responses to temporally manipulated versions of an auditory narrative (Figure 1A). They compared the responses during the original intact clip against the response during versions of the stimulus in which the ordering of words, sentences, or paragraphs was scrambled. The authors observed that early sensory regions exhibited similar responses to the intact and scrambled audio; these early regions were said to have a short processing timescale, because their responses at each moment were largely independent of prior context. Moving toward higher-order cortices, such as temporoparietal junction, precuneus, and lateral prefrontal cortex, Lerner et al., 2011Lerner Y. Honey C.J. Silbert L.J. Hasson U. Topographic mapping of a hierarchy of temporal receptive windows using a narrated story.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2906-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar observed different responses to the intact and scrambled input. In these higher-order regions, the response at one moment could depend on stimulus properties from more than 30 s earlier (Figure 1B). Overall, higher stages of cortical processing were said to have longer processing timescales, because their responses at time t were affected by properties of the stimulus from many seconds earlier (Figure 1C). In this study, we first developed computational models that could explain the key empirical phenomena from prior studies (e.g., Lerner et al., 2011Lerner Y. Honey C.J. Silbert L.J. Hasson U. Topographic mapping of a hierarchy of temporal receptive windows using a narrated story.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2906-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). If we have measured the neural responses to temporally “intact” and “scrambled” versions of the stimulus, then we can quantify the similarity of responses to the same segment presented in the intact and scrambled order as the “intact-vs-scramble correlation” (Figure 1D). The two key phenomena of hierarchical context dependence are then as follows:(P1)lower processing stages are largely insensitive to temporal context (Figure 1D, left bars); and(P2)progressively higher processing stages are increasingly sensitive to temporal context extending further into the past (Figure 1D, right bars). We found that P1 and P2 could be explained by a model that does not invoke explicit temporal integration (the “signal gain model”; Figure 1E) and also by a model that does employ temporal integration (the “hierarchical linear integrator” [HLI] model; Figure 1F). To decide between these two models, we empirically tested a distinctive prediction of hierarchical integration models: when two people with distinct neural states are presented with a common input, their neural responses should gradually align over time as the common input continues, and this alignment should occur more slowly in higher-order regions. Our empirical measurements revealed new evidence that cortical circuits hierarchically integrate input with prior context. We measured moment-by-moment changes in fMRI responses as two groups of participants heard the same natural auditory speech segments preceded by different contexts. We found that the fMRI responses gradually aligned over time across the two groups, when each group heard the same input preceded by a different context. The responses aligned earliest in sensory regions but later and later in regions at consecutive stages of processing. This finding is consistent with the predictions of the HLI model but could not be explained by the signal gain model. Thus, the topography of these alignment patterns provides new evidence for a distributed and hierarchical representation of temporal context in the human brain. If temporal integration is linear in the brain, then regions that are slower to integrate new information should also be slower to forget old information. But is this observed? To measure forgetting, we examined the rate at which fMRI states “separate” when two groups of participants begin with a common context, but are then exposed to distinct input. We found that, although higher-order regions aligned across contexts more gradually than sensory regions, they did not separate more gradually. This decoupling of alignment times and separation times rules out standard linear integrator models and seems to require a mechanism for flexibly varying how new and old information are combined. Finally, to account for the decoupling between alignment times and separation times in cortical dynamics, we proposed a model of temporal integration, the hierarchical autoencoders in time (HAT) model. By combining non-linear integration and context gating mechanisms, HAT generated learning-dependent representations that account for the existing empirical phenomena (P1 and P2, above) while also exhibiting hierarchical alignment times and a distinct set of timescales for alignment and separation. In the HAT model, integration is flexible: at appropriate moments, such as the start of a new event, the model can generate a response that depends less on the prior context. We conclude that each stage of cortical hierarchy maintains a temporal context representation, which is continually updated as a simplified combination of past and present information and which can also be reset following surprising input. We considered two computational models to account for the empirical phenomena P1 and P2: a model based on engagement with the stimulus (signal gain model, Figure 1E), and a model employing hierarchical temporal integration (the HLI model; Figure 1F). It is possible to account for the hierarchical-context-dependence phenomena (P1 and P2; Figure 1D) without invoking distributed temporal integration. Instead, one can offer an explanation based on “signal gain” combined with a qualitative notion of “engagement.” This model makes three assumptions: (1) when participants engage more deeply with a stimulus, the gain of their response to that stimulus increases relative to the noise level, and they produce more reliable neural responses to that stimulus (Cohen et al., 2018Cohen S.S. Madsen J. Touchan G. Robles D. Lima S.F.A. Henin S. Parra L.C. Neural engagement with online educational videos predicts learning performance for individual students.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2018; 155: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Dmochowski et al., 2012Dmochowski J.P. Sajda P. Dias J. Parra L.C. Correlated components of ongoing EEG point to emotionally laden attention - a possible marker of engagement?.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2012; 6: 112Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); (2) participants are less “engaged” with temporally scrambled stimuli than with intact stimuli; and (3) the effects of engagement on neural reliability are larger in higher-order cortical regions. Under these assumptions, the existing empirical data can be explained. First, sensory neocortex would be largely unaffected by engagement (and thus unaffected by scrambling prior context); second, higher-order regions would respond less reliably to scrambled stimuli, and so their intact-versus-scramble correlations would also be decreased (Figure 1E; see STAR Methods). Thus, the signal gain model could explain data from the scrambling experiment, without recourse to any neural representation of temporal context, and it provides an important null model. It is also possible to account for the hierarchical-context-dependence phenomena (P1 and P2; Figure 1D) using a model that explicitly represents and integrates temporal context. We used a linear integration approach inspired by neural integrators in systems neuroscience and mathematical psychology (Huk and Shadlen, 2005Huk A.C. Shadlen M.N.

The Stochastic Modeling of Elementary Psychological Processes. Cambridge University Press, 1983Google Scholar) and in particular by the seminal “temporal context model” (TCM) in memory research (Howard and Kahana, 2002Howard M.W. Kahana M.J. A distributed representation of temporal context.J. Math. Psychol. 2002; 46: 269-299Crossref Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In TCM, the arrival of each new stimulus generates linear “drift” of an internal context variable. In particular, if we define the current context as CNTX(t) and the current input as IN(t), a simple form of the update equation for TCM isCNTX(t+1)=ρiCNTX(t)+βiIN(t),where ρi and βi are parameters that determine the proportion of old and new information in the updated context. To generate an HLI, we stacked these linear integrator units in stages, and we increased ρ (and decreased β) at higher levels of processing. In this way, we increased the proportion of prior information retained at higher stages of the simulated hierarchy. The input to the higher-level integrators was the updated CNTX vector from the lower-level integrator, generating a cascade of temporal integration (Figure 1F; see STAR Methods). We quantitatively confirmed that both the signal gain model and the hierarchical linear integrator could capture the previously described phenomena (P1 and P2) of hierarchical context dependence (Figures 1D and S2; STAR Methods). Therefore, to provide direct evidence for hierarchical temporal integration (and to rule out the signal gain model), it was necessary to collect more fine-grained measurements of the neural processing of temporally extended sequences. We developed a time-resolved fMRI pattern analysis approach for measuring context-dependent responses to auditory narratives. To understand the time-resolved analysis, consider a case in which two groups of subjects are exposed to the same ∼20-s segment of natural speech (e.g., sentence E), but this shared segment is preceded by different speech segments across the two groups (e.g., sentence C or sentence D; Figure 2A). In this setting we can ask how similar the neural responses are within and across these groups, second by second, as they process the shared segment from start to end. At the start of the sentence, the two groups share none of their prior context, but by the end of the sentence, they share much greater amounts of prior context. To quantify neural similarity within and across groups, we calculated the inter-subject pattern correlation (ISPC) at each time point. Three kinds of ISPC were calculated (STAR Methods): similarity within the intact group (i.e., intact-intact correlation [rII]), similarity within the scramble group (i.e., scramble-scramble correlation [rSS]), and similarity across the intact and the scramble groups (i.e., intact-scramble correlation [rSI]) (Figures 2B and 2C). We first examined the curves of rII, rSS, and rSI within one lower-order region (near A1+; Figure 2D, left) and one higher-order region (near the temporal-parietal junction [TPJ]; Figure 2D, right). In both regions, we observed that (1) the rII and rSS curves were essentially constant from the beginning to the end of a segment; and (2) the rSI curve ramped upward over time, as the intact and scrambled groups were exposed to more and more shared input. These patterns (flat rII, flat rSS, and ramping rSI) are preserved across the cerebral cortex (Figures 2E and S4A) when we broaden our analysis to a cortex-wide atlas of regions of interest (ROIs) (Schaefer et al., 2018Schaefer A. Kong R. Gordon E.M. Laumann T.O. Zuo X.N. Holmes A.J. Eickhoff S.B. Yeo B.T.T. Local-global parcellation of the human cerebral cortex from intrinsic functional connectivity MRI.Cereb. Cortex. 2018; 28: 3095-3114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined how the temporal integration profile (rII, rSS, and rSI) differed across regions. To illustrate the basic phenomenon, we examined the rII and rSS curves (within-group correlation) for one sensory region (A1+) and one higher-order region (right TPJ). In A1+, we found that rII and rSS were similar to each other across the whole segments, suggesting that early auditory cortex showed highly reliable responses to the same segments in the two conditions in which the contexts are different (Figure 2D, left). In rTPJ, on the other hand, the rII curve was significantly higher than the rSS (t(21) = 2.83, p = 0.007, t test of mean rII and rSS values per segment; Figure 2D, right). The increased response reliability in the TPJ for the intact condition could reflect greater engagement or the fact that the intact stimulus is more familiar. However, the rII and rSS curves do not provide a time-resolved measurement of shared context representation, which can instead be obtained via the across-group correlation (rSI). The across-group correlation (rSI) ramped upward over time within each story segment, and this ramping occurred later in the higher-order cortex (TPJ) than in sensory cortex (A1+). In A1+, the rSI time course begins to achieve alignment at 4 s after the segment onset, while in TPJ the rSI time course begins to achieve alignment more than 7 s after onset (Figure 2D). Importantly, the fact that rSI = 0 at the onset of the segment does not necessarily reflect a neural context: the hemodynamics introduce temporal smoothing, carrying signal from the previous segment into the start of the current segment, even if the underlying neural response is unaffected by context. This hemodynamic artifact makes it difficult to use blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) imaging to estimate the shortest possible time at which temporal context effects operate. However, the hemodynamics cannot account for the ramping in TPJ occurring more than 3 s later than in A1+. Instead, the later alignment time in TPJ points to a neural context effect, with a longer timescale in higher-order regions. Thus, we tested the generality of this hierarchical pattern by mapping the timescales of context construction across the cerebral cortex. The alignment of response across the intact and scramble groups (rSI) increased over time in almost every ROI, and the latency of this ramping differed across brain regions. Because the shape of the rSI curve is not meaningful when the response in the scrambled condition is unreliable, we restricted our analysis of the rSI ramping to the 83 ROIs in which there was a reliable response to the scrambled stimulus (i.e., mean rSS > 0.06; see STAR Methods; Figure S3A). After confirming that a logistic function could accurately summarize the rSI curves (Figure S3C), we used logistic fitting to quantify the timescale of rSI ramping in each ROI. We defined the “alignment time” as the time at which the logistic curve reaches its half maximum. We excluded 4 ROIs that were not well fit by a logistic function (Figure S3B), and 9 ROIs for which alignment times were unreliable (assessed by bootstrapping; Figure S3D; see STAR Methods). We thus entered 70 ROIs into further analysis. A direct visualization of the raw rSI time courses in each ROI reveals that the logistic fitting accurately captured the profile of the rSI curves and that alignment times differ across areas (Figures 2E and S4). Mapping the alignment times across the lateral and medial cortical surface, we observed a “hierarchy of context construction” in the human brain. Early auditory regions first arrive at a shared context-dependent response, followed by consecutive stages of the cortical hierarchy. Alignment times of rSI curves gradually increased from sensory cortex (alignment times ∼4 s) toward higher-order regions (alignment times of 10 s or longer; Figure 3, top). Plotting rSI curves along the auditory processing pathway confirmed the hierarchical organization (Figure 3, bottom): lower-level regions (e.g., A1+) quickly arrived at a shared response between intact and scrambled groups, while regions in inferior parietal and medial parietal cortex took longer to align across the intact and scrambled groups. The results of hierarchical context construction rule out the signal gain model, because it could not account for different rates of context construction at different levels of the cortex (Figure 2F). On the other hand, the HLI model could account for these inter-regional differences, because its higher-level integrators have longer time constants; the rSI curves in the HLI model ramp upward later for higher-level linear integrators (Figure 2G; t = −104, p < 0.0001), and this effect is magnified by the fact that the integrators are stacked in a hierarchy (Figure S5C; Table S1). Because the signal gain model can capture variations in the mean level of the rII and rSS curves and the asymptotic height of each rSI curve (which may reflect variation in engagement across the intact and scrambled stimuli) (Figure 2F), the signal gain mechanisms should still be considered as a component of future models. However, the dominant pattern in our data (the hierarchical variation in alignment times) requires a model that maintains temporal context to varying degrees across regions. The time-resolved pattern analysis indicates that information is temporally integrated second by second throughout the cortex. But is integrating information from the past always desirable? For example, if the subject of a new sentence is unrelated to the verb of the previous sentence, then perhaps we might want to separate these pieces of information rather than integrate them. Therefore, in addition to the process of integrating information over time, we also measured the neural process of separating information from distinct events. We have already shown that the two groups will gradually construct an aligned mental context and begin to respond in the same way to common input (Figure 4A, middle), but what happens when the common input ends? At this moment, the two groups begin to hear different inputs, and yet these different inputs are preceded by the shared context. We expect that the two groups should gradually “forget” the previously shared mental context, but its influence may persist for some time (Figure 4A, right). How quickly will individual brain regions forget the previous shared context? In a linear integrator model, such as HLI, information is integrated with a fixed time constant, and so the rate of accumulating new information is strongly correlated with the rate of forgetting old information (STAR Methods). This leads to a testable prediction: if temporal integration within each region has a fixed time constant, then regions which integrate information more slowly (i.e., higher-order regions) should also forget prior information more slowly. Thus, we can test the class of linear integrator models by testing whether rates of contextual alignment and separation are correlated across regions. Contrary to the predictions of linear integrator models, rates of alignment and separation were uncorrelated in the human cerebral cortex. We operationalized the “forgetting” of shared context as the “separation time” of neural responses that begin with a common context. The separation time was measured analogously to alignment time: how quickly neural responses diverge when participants processed different input preceded by a shared prior context. To visualize the relationship between context construction and forgetting, we grouped brain regions according to their alignment time (rSICONSTRUCT or rSIDE:CE) and then visualized the rate at which they forgot prior information (rSIFORGET or rSICD:CE). The rSIFORGET curves decreased at a similar rate, regardless of whether the corresponding rSICONSTRUCT curve had a fast or a slow alignment time (Figure 4D). Moreover, we observed no correlation between alignment time and separation time across ROIs (r = −0.13, p = 0.33; Figure S5B). This decoupling of alignment times and separation times cannot be explained by fixed-rate linear integrator models, such as HLI, in which the correlation between alignment times and separation times is very strong (r = 0.99; Figure S5B). The mismatch of alignment and separation times in cortical dynamics indicates that the integration rate is variable, consistent with the notion that temporal sequences are grouped into events, and that prior context is more rapidly forgotten at event boundaries (Reynolds et al., 2007Reynolds J.R.

https://openalex.org/W3011705488,"To interpret the environment, our brain must evaluate external stimuli against internal representations from past experiences. How primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices process stimuli depending on recent experiences is unclear. Using simultaneous multi-area population imaging of projection neurons and focal optogenetic inactivation, we studied mice performing a whisker-based working memory task. We find that activity reflecting a current stimulus, the recollection of a previous stimulus (cued recall), and the stimulus category are distributed across S1 and S2. Despite this overlapping representation, S2 is important for processing cued recall responses and transmitting these responses to S1. S2 network properties differ from S1, wherein S2 persistently encodes cued recall and the stimulus category under passive conditions. Although both areas encode the stimulus category, only information in S1 is important for task performance through pathways that do not necessarily include S2. These findings reveal both distributed and segregated roles for S1 and S2 in context-dependent sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W3011728477,"The ability of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to form biofilms, can be considered an important factor that contributes to the prevalence of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) due to the inaccessibility of the antibiotics into the highly complex structure of the biofilm. Moreover, with the appearance of antibiotic multiresistant UPEC strains, the alternatives of treatment of UTIs are less. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can be useful in the treatment of the UPEC infections due to its physicochemical properties that confer them antibacterial activity against both planktonic and biofilm structured cells. A diversity of biological methods for synthesis of AgNPs with antimicrobial activity has been widely investigated during the last decades, between these methods; the fungal-biosynthesis of AgNPs highlights as an ecofriendly, scalable and low cost method. In this study, biogenic AgNPs were synthesized with extracellular metabolites secreted by the soil fungal strain Fusarium scirpi (Ag0.5-5) by an ecofriendly, simple and efficient method. The antimicrobial activity of the biosynthesized AgNPs against UPEC was evaluated. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of biogenic AgNPs over planktonic UPEC cells was 25 mg/mL, whereas a sub-MIC concentration (7.5 mg/L) was sufficient to inhibit the UPEC-biofilm formation about a 97%, or produce the disruption of an 80% of mature UPEC-biofilms demonstrating the potential of fungal-derived AgNPs to prevent UPEC infections."

https://openalex.org/W3011597861,"Trapped atoms and ions are among the best controlled quantum systems which find widespread applications in quantum information, sensing and metrology. For molecules, however, a similar degree of control is currently lacking owing to their complex energy-level structure. Quantum-logic protocols in which atomic ions serve as probes for molecular ions are a promising route for achieving this level of control, especially with homonuclear molecules that decouple from black-body radiation. Here, a quantum-non-demolition protocol on single trapped N$_2^+$ molecules is demonstrated. The spin-rovibronic state of the molecule is detected with more than 99% fidelity and the position and strength of a spectroscopic transition in the molecule are determined, both without destroying the molecular quantum state. The present method lays the foundations for new approaches to molecular precision spectroscopy, for state-to-state chemistry on the single-molecule level and for the implementation of molecular qubits."
https://openalex.org/W3012421826,"The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is estimated to be as high as 30% among refugees. The coexistence of prevalent chronic pain is believed to maintain symptoms of PTSD and add complexity to the condition. Despite this, little evidence exists on how to treat PTSD and comorbid conditions best in trauma-affected refugees.The aim of the present study was to investigate if adding either BBAT or mixed physical activity to the treatment as usual (TAU) for trauma-affected refugees with PTSD would increase the treatment effect compared to TAU alone.Randomised controlled trial, 3-armed parallel group superiority study, conducted at Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry, Denmark. Participants were adult trauma-affected refugees with PTSD. Allocation ratio was 1:1:1, stratified for PTSD severity and gender. An open-label design was applied due to the nature of the intervention. Participants were randomised to receive either individual basic body awareness therapy (group B) or individual mixed physical activity (group M) one hour/week for 20 weeks plus TAU, or TAU only (group C). The primary outcome was PTSD severity measured by Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01955538.Of the 338 patients included (C/B/M = 110/114/114), 318 patients were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis (C/B/M = 104/105/109). On the primary outcome, intention-to-treat as well as per-protocol analyses showed small but significant improvement on scores from pre- to post-treatment in all three groups but with no significant difference in improvement between groups.The findings do not provide evidence that either BBAT or mixed physical activity as add-on treatment bring significantly larger improvement on symptoms of PTSD compared to TAU alone for adult, trauma-affected refugees. There is a need for studies on potential subpopulations of trauma-affected refugees who could benefit from physical activity as a part of their treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3011716490,"Grape downy mildew (GDM) is a major disease of grapevine that has an impact on both the yields of the vines and the quality of the harvested fruits. The disease is currently controlled by repetitive fungicide treatments throughout the season, especially in the Bordeaux vineyards where the average number of fungicide treatments against GDM was equal to 10.1 in 2013. Reducing the number of treatments is a major issue from both an environmental and a public health point of view. One solution would be to identify vineyards that are likely to be heavily attacked in spring and then apply fungicidal treatments only to these situations. In this perspective, we use here a dataset including 9 years of GDM observations to develop and compare several generalized linear models and machine learning algorithms predicting the probability of high incidence and severity in the Bordeaux region. The algorithms tested use the date of disease onset and/or average monthly temperatures and precipitation as input variables. The accuracy of the tested models and algorithms is assessed by year-by-year cross validation. LASSO, random forest and gradient boosting algorithms show better performance than generalized linear models. The date of onset of the disease has a greater influence on the accuracy of forecasts than weather inputs and, among weather inputs, precipitation has a greater influence than temperature. The best performing algorithm was selected to evaluate the impact of contrasted climate scenarios on GDM risk levels. Results show that risk of GDM at bunch closure decreases with reduced rainfall and increased temperatures in April-May. Our results also show that the use of fungicide treatment decision rules that take into account local characteristics would reduce the number of treatments against GDM in the Bordeaux vineyards compared to current practices by at least 50%."

Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), an exogenous bioscavenger of OPs, can be used as a treatment for OP exposure. It is prerequisite to develop in vitro brain models that can study BuChE post-treatment for acute OP exposure. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) brain-on-chip platform with human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes to simulate human brain behavior. The platform consists of two compartments: 1) a hydrogel embedded with human iPSC-derived GABAergic neurons and astrocytes and 2) a perfusion channel with dynamic medium flow. The brain tissue constructs were exposed to Malathion (MT) at various concentrations and then treated with BuChE after 20 minutes of MT exposure. Results show that the iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes directly interacted and formed synapses in the 3D matrix, and that treatment with BuChE improved viability after MT exposure up to a concentration of 10−3 M. We conclude that the 3D brain-on-chip platform with human iPSC-derived brain cells is a suitable model to study the neurotoxicity of OP exposure and evaluate therapeutic compounds for treatment."

In two dimensions, one can similarly define ice rules for in-plane Ising-like spins arranged on a kagome lattice. These ice rules require each triangle plaquette to have a single monopole, and can lead to various unique orders and excitations. Using experimental and theoretical approaches including magnetometry, thermodynamic measurements, neutron scattering and Monte Carlo simulations, we establish HoAgGe as a crystalline (i.e. non-artificial) system that realizes the kagome spin ice state. The system features a variety of partially and fully ordered states and a sequence of field-induced phases at low temperatures, all consistent with the kagome ice rule."

A non-parametric population pharmacokinetic model was applied to explore TAC pharmacokinetics in blood and PBMC. Concurrently, calcineurin activity was measured in PBMC. Influence of donor and recipient genetic polymorphisms of ABCB1, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 on TAC exposure was assessed. Recipient ABCB1 polymorphisms 1199G>A could influence TAC whole blood and intracellular exposure (p<0.05). No association was found between CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 genotypes and TAC whole blood or intracellular concentrations. Finally, intra-PBMC calcineurin activity appeared incompletely inhibited by TAC and less than 50% of patients were expected to achieve intracellular IC50 concentration (100 pg/millions of cells) at therapeutic whole blood concentration (i.e.: 4-10 ng/mL). Together, these data suggest that personalized medicine regarding TAC therapy might be optimized by ABCB1 pharmacogenetic biomarkers and by monitoring intracellular concentration whereas the relationship between intracellular TAC exposure and pharmacodynamics biomarkers more specific than calcineurin activity should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3011802173,"This study was designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of a curcumin treatment on the knee of rats with induced osteoarthritis. Fifteen adult rats were used and divided in three groups: the osteoarthritis group (OAG), control group (CG–without induction of osteoarthritis), and curcumin-treated osteoarthritis group (COAG). Osteoarthritis was induced in the right knee of rats in the OAG and COAG by administering an intra-articular injection of 1 mg of zymosan. Fourteen days after induction, 50 mg/kg curcumin was administered by gavage daily for 60 days to the COAG. After the treatment period, rats from all groups were euthanized. Medial femoral condyles were collected for light microscopy and immunohistochemical staining. The expression of SOX-5, IHH, MMP-8, MMP-13, and collagen 2 (Col2) was analyzed. The COAG exhibited an increase in the number of chondrocytes in the surface and middle layers compared with that of the OAG and CG, respectively. The COAG also showed a decrease in the thicknesses of the middle and deep layers compared with those of the OAG, and an increase in Col2 expression was observed in all articular layers (surface, middle, and deep) in the COAG compared with that in the OAG. SOX-5 expression was increased in the surface and deep layers of the COAG compared with those in the OAG and CG. Based on the results of this study, the curcumin treatment appeared to exert a protective effect on cartilage, as it did not result in an increase in cartilage thickness or in MMP-8 and MMP-13 expression but led to increased IHH, Col2, and SOX-5 expression and the number of chondrocytes."

Multiple factors contributed to undernutrition of HIV/AIDS patients and it need immediate identification and prompt action. The objective of this study was to assess the nutritional status of patients and identify factors associated with undernutrition among HIV/AIDS patients on follow-up care in Jimma medical center, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study design was conducted from March-April 2016. Data were collected retrospectively from clinical records of HIV/AIDS patients enrolled for follow up care in ART clinic from June 2010 to January 2016. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify independent predictor of undernutrition. Results Data of 1062 patients were included in the study. The prevalence of undernutrition (BMI<18.5 kg/m2) and overweight or obesity were 34% and 9%, respectively. Out of undernourished patients, severely malnourished patients (BMI<16 kg/m2) accounted of 9%. Undernutrition was more likely among widowed patients (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.03–2.79), patients with no access to water supply (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.16–2.47) and patients in the WHO clinical stage of three (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI, 1.33–2.97) and four (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI, 1.74–5.07). Moreover, the odds of undernutrition was more likely among patients with CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm3 (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI, 1.38–2.47) and patients with a functional status of bedridden (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI, 1.55–8.35) and ambulatory (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI, 1.66–3.51), respectively. Conclusion Both undernutrition and overweight or obesity were prevalent among HIV/AIDS patients in Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. Undernutrition was significantly associated with clinical outcome of patients. Hence, nutritional assessment, care and support should be strengthened. Critical identification of malnourished patients and prompt interventions should be undertaken."

However, the relative importance of specific mitochondrial functions and their dependence on MFNs vary greatly among cell types. Osteoclasts have many mitochondria, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation enhance bone resorption, but little is known about the mitochondrial network or MFNs in osteoclasts. Because expression of each MFN isoform increases with osteoclastogenesis, we conditionally deleted MFN1 and MFN2 (double conditional KO (dcKO)) in murine osteoclast precursors, finding that this increased bone mass in young female mice and abolished osteoclast precursor differentiation into mature osteoclasts in vitro. Defective osteoclastogenesis was reversed by overexpression of MFN2 but not MFN1; therefore, we generated mice lacking only MFN2 in osteoclasts. MFN2-deficient female mice had increased bone mass at 1 year and resistance to Receptor Activator of NF-κB Ligand (RANKL)-induced osteolysis at 8 weeks. To explore whether MFN-mediated tethering or mitophagy is important for osteoclastogenesis, we overexpressed MFN2 variants defective in either function in dcKO precursors and found that, although mitophagy was dispensable for differentiation, tethering was required. Because the master osteoclastogenic transcriptional regulator nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) is calcium-regulated, we assessed calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum and store-operated calcium entry and found that the latter was blunted in dcKO cells. Restored osteoclast differentiation by expression of intact MFN2 or the mitophagy-defective variant was associated with normalization of store-operated calcium entry and NFATc1 levels, indicating that MFN2 controls mitochondrion–endoplasmic reticulum tethering in osteoclasts.

We were prompted to explore the role of mitochondrial dynamics in OCs because this specialized cell type is mitochondrion-rich and undergoes vast morphological changes to become a mature multinucleated cell. We hypothesized that mitochondrial fusion might accompany OC precursor fusion during osteoclastogenesis and that tethering of mitochondria to each other or the ER is important for OC formation and/or function. To test this, we generated a mouse model in which MFN1 and MFN2 are conditionally deleted in the OC lineage with LysM-cre. We found that knockout of both homologs is associated with increased bone mass in female animals and blunted osteoclastogenesis in culture. Rescue experiments in vitro revealed that MFN2 more strongly induces osteoclastogenesis than MFN1 and that in vivo, depletion of MFN2 is protective against age- and RANKL-induced bone loss. Last, we demonstrate mitochondrial tethering to be the predominant function of MFN2 in OCs, associated with changes in Ca2+–NFATc1 signaling. Because OCs undergo vast morphological changes to become mature multinucleated cells, we hypothesized that alterations in mitochondrial dynamics, and fusion in particular, accompany and modulate this event. To prevent mitochondrial fusion, we employed mice with floxed alleles for both Mfn1 and Mfn2, directing their excision to the OC lineage with LysM-cre. All of our mice were mated onto a homozygous cre background (LysMc/c) to increase recombination efficiency. We intercrossed double heterozygous (LysMc/c; (Mfn1/2)fl/+ = ctrl) mice to generate double knockout (LysMc/c; (Mfn1/2)fl/fl; dcKO) littermates, which were born at normal Mendelian ratios. Subsequently, these dcKO progeny were mated to the double-heterozygous ctrl mice to produce our experimental groups. In parallel, double heterozygous ctrl mice were bred to cre-only (LysMc/c;(Mfn1/2)+/+) mice to generate a cohort of ctrl and cre-only littermates. Importantly, there was no difference in bone mass parameters between ctrl and cre-only groups (Fig. S1, A–N), indicating that ctrl double-heterozygous animals are an appropriate control group for dcKO mice. dcKO mice showed no obvious gross phenotypes and had weights identical to ctrl littermates (Fig. S2, A and B). Male and female animals were sacrificed at 2 months of age, a time of high OC activity, and basal bone morphology was assessed by μCT of dissected femora. We found a strong bone phenotype in female animals at this age, with all trabecular and cortical parameters consistent with a high bone mass (significantly increased bone volume (BV) per total volume (TV), bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular number (Tb.N), and cortical thickness (Cort.Th)) (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. S2, C–F). Interestingly, males showed no significant differences between ctrl and dcKO groups in any of these parameters (Fig. 1, C and D, and Fig. S2, G–J). Serum CTX-1 levels were decreased in dcKO females, indicating a decrease in bone catabolism (Fig. 2A). Histomorphometry showed that OC surface and number in dcKOs trended lower than in ctrls in female mice (Fig. 2, B–E). Osteoblast–OC coupling was not affected by loss of MFN1 and MFN2 in OCs; indices of bone formation, such as serum P1NP, mineralizing surface, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate, were unchanged between groups (Fig. 2, F–K).Figure 2Female Mfn1/2 dcKOs have decreased OC activity but no change in bone formation. A, serum CTX-1 assay shows decreased bone resorption in 2-month-old dcKO females. B and C, histomorphometry of TRAP stained tibiae reveals a modest decreases in dcKO Oc.N/BS (B) and Oc.S/BS (C).

Compared with cre-only OCs with WT mitofusin expression, double-heterozygous ctrls produced less MFN1 and MFN2 protein, which was further diminished in dcKO cells (Fig. 3A). dcKOs were unable to respond to RANKL and differentiate into OCs on plastic wells, whereas differentiation of ctrls was intact (Fig. 3B). When cultured on bone, resorption was also minimal (Fig. 3C). Consistently, levels of the OC markers NFATc1, DC-STAMP, and CTSK were reduced in dcKOs at the mRNA level (Fig. 3, D–F). Western blots also demonstrated lower levels of Cathepsin K (CTSK) and C-SRC proteins, which supports a defect in OC differentiation (Fig. 3G). The levels of protein and mRNA for both MFN homologs increased throughout osteoclastogenesis in WT cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, we sought to determine whether MFN1 or MFN2 was dominant in contributing to the dcKO phenotype and attempted to rescue the defect in OC formation by retrovirally expressing MFN1 or MFN2 in dcKO BMMs. We found that overexpression of MFN2, but not MFN1, restored full OC differentiation, suggesting that MFN2 is the dominant mitofusin homolog that supports osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 4, C–E). To assess whether loss of MFN2 alone in OC lineage cells would have an effect on bone mass in vivo, we generated littermate cohorts of mice with WT Mfn2 (LysMc/c; Mfn2+/+; cre-only) and conditionally targeted Mfn2 (LysMc/c; Mfn2fl/fl; Mfn2 cKO). We confirmed depletion of MFN2 by evaluating protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 5, A and B). Although we observed upward trends in female Mfn2 cKOs at 2 and 4 months of age, the differences in BV/TV and BMD did not become statistically significant until 12 months of age; there was no difference in bone mass between male cKO and male cre-only mice at any age examined (Fig. 5, C–F, Table 1, and Table S1). The percentage of trabecular bone retained from 4 months to 12 months was 24% for ctrls versus 46% for cKO females (64% versus 63% for males). Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-stained 2-month-old tibia sections show a trend toward lower OC number and surface per bone surface (Oc.N/BS and Oc.S/BS) in female cKO mice (Fig. S3). Thus, loss of MFN2 has limited effects on basal bone mass in young animals, whereas it protects female mice from age-related bone loss.Table 1Trabecular bone parameters are increased in female Mfn2 cKOs at 12 months of ageFemale cre-onlyFemale Mfn2 cKOp valueBV/TV2 mo.0.085 ± 0.0210.102 ± 0.0260.1454 mo.0.096 ± 0.0140.111 ± 0.0320.17512 mo.0.023 ± 0.0140.051 ± 0.0370.012*BMD (mg/cm3)2 mo.180.9 ± 18.3195.4 ± 20.60.1154 mo.193.5 ± 12.4205.3 ± 23.50.16612 mo.116.9 ± 12.2145 ± 34.50.007**Tb.N.

We hypothesized that this may be the case for Mfn2 cKO animals and therefore induced acute osteolysis in 2-month-old animals. Male and female cre-only and cKO mice were challenged with intraperitoneal RANKL injection, which stimulates OC activity and induces significant loss of trabecular bone in 2 days. Although cre-only males, male cKOs, and cre-only females lost 30%–45% of trabecular bone fraction following RANKL injection, female cKOs were protected from induced osteolysis, showing no significant change (Fig. 5, G–I, and Fig. S4). Therefore, even with a strong OC stimulus, male mice are not affected by loss of MFN2, whereas female mice require MFN2 in the OC to respond. MFN2 has two primary molecular functions, tethering/fusion and mitophagy, that can be selectively disabled via mutation of threonine and serine residues to constitutively activate or ablate the signal for mitophagy (24Gong G. Song M. Csordas G. Kelly D.P. Matkovich S.J. Dorn 2nd, G.W.

MFN2 T111E-S442E (MFN2-EE) mimics phosphorylation by PINK1 kinase, driving spontaneous mitophagy and preventing fusion, leading to a highly fragmented mitochondrial network. In contrast, MFN2 T111A-S442A (MFN2-AA) has the opposite effect; the nonphosphorylatable MFN2 residues eliminate mitophagy but allow normal tethering and fusion (Fig. 6A) (24Gong G. Song M. Csordas G. Kelly D.P. Matkovich S.J. Dorn 2nd, G.W.

To examine the ability of either MFN2 function to impact OCs, we retrovirally overexpressed each mutant, along with empty vector (V) and MFN2-WT controls, in female dcKO BMMs that were defective in producing OCs (Fig. 6B). To verify that mutants were functioning properly, we stained transduced BMMs with MitoTracker Green and LysoTracker Red prior to live-cell confocal microscopy (Fig. 6C). Mitochondrial colocalization with lysosomes, an indication of mitophagy, was minimal under all conditions. Similar to previous studies with these constructs, MFN2-WT and MFN2-AA increased tethering and fusion, as manifested by increased mitochondrial aspect ratios (mitochondrial length/mitochondrial width) compared with less fused V and MFN2-EE samples (Fig. 6D). Following 6 days of RANKL exposure, cultures were fixed and stained for TRAP (Fig. 6, E and F). We found that transduction of dcKO BMMs with MFN2-AA restored osteoclastogenesis to a level comparable with MFN2-WT, indicating that the mitophagy function of MFN2 is dispensable for osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, transduction with MFN2-EE had only a minimal effect on osteoclastogenesis, suggesting that tethering/fusion by MFN2 is necessary for osteoclastogenesis to occur efficiently (Fig. 6, C–F). Because MNF1 was absent from these cells, this reveals that mitochondrial tethering by MFN2 contributes to OC formation in a way that MFN1 cannot. To further explore the mechanism through which MFN2 controls osteoclastogenesis, we assayed cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels with Fura-2 basally, following ATP stimulation (to release ER calcium stores) and after addition of extracellular calcium (2 mm) to activate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). In pre-OCs generated with 48 h of RANKL exposure, dcKOs had higher basal Ca2+ levels and a similar ATP-mediated spike from baseline but a muted intake of Ca2+ following SOCE activation compared with ctrls, as assessed by area under curve quantification (Fig. 7, A–C). We used the same assay in dcKO BMMs overexpressing MFN2-WT, -EE, and -AA. Compared with the vector control, MFN2-WT and MFN2-AA increased responsiveness to extracellular Ca2+ whereas MFN2-EE did not, suggesting that the tethering function of MFN2 regulates SOCE (Fig. 7, D–F). Congruent with restoration of osteoclastogenesis, cells with improved SOCE (MFN2-WT and -AA) had increased NFATc1 levels compared with dcKOs with V or MFN2-EE transduction, linking the MFN2 tethering function to the Ca2+–NFATc1 axis during OC differentiation (Fig. 7G). An abundance of mitochondria has been deemed important for function of the OC, and increases in mitochondrial proteins are associated with differentiation from myeloid precursors (16Zeng R. Faccio R.

OCs have been reported to utilize oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis, and it has been suggested that the primary function of mitochondria may not be ATP generation at the ruffled border (29Arnett T.R.

In the present study, to test alterations of intestinal microbiota at high altitude comparing to that at low altitude, we analyzed rat feces from plain group and high-altitude group by 16S rRNA analysis. To detect concentrations of aspirin and salicylic acid, we established a reliable liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method to measure aspirin and salicylic acid concentrations in fecal suspensions and plasma. Our study found that the plateau hypoxic environment caused a significant increase in Bacteroides in rat feces, while Corynebacterium, Prevotella, and Coprococcus were declined. In addition, compared with the plain group, the metabolic activity of fecal suspensions from the plateau group on aspirin was significantly reduced. More importantly, these changes in the intestinal microbiota led to increasing absorption of aspirin in the rats after rapidly ascent to the plateau, and a reduction in the pharmacodynamic index TXB2, which would possibly result in bleeding. In conclusion, our research provides new ideas for changes in plateau pharmacokinetics, and then guide the corresponding reduction in aspirin dose for the population quickly entering the plateau."
https://openalex.org/W3011698809,"Social withdrawal in the sub-chronic phencyclidine (PCP) rat model, a behavioral correlate of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, results from deficits in brain endocannabinoid transmission. As cannabis intake has been shown to affect negatively the course and expression of psychosis, we tested whether the beneficial effects of endocannabinoid-mediated CB1 activation on social withdrawal in PCP-treated rats (5 mg/kg, twice daily for 7 days)also occurred after administration of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.). In addition, we assessed whether THC affected two correlates of positive symptoms: 1) motor activity induced by d-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), and 2) dopamine neuron population activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). After the motor activity test, the brains from d-amphetamine-treated animals were collected and processed for measurements of endocannabinoids and activation of Akt/GSK3β, two molecular markers involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In control rats, THC dose-dependently produced social interaction deficits and aberrant VTA dopamine neuron population activity similar to those observed in PCP-treated animals. In PCP-treated rats, only the lowest dose of THC reversed PCP-induced deficits, as well as PCP-induced elevation of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) in the nucleus accumbens. Last, THC activated the Akt/GSK3β pathway dose-dependently in both control and PCP-treated animals. Taken together, these data suggest that only low doses of THC have beneficial effects on behavioral, neurochemical and electrophysiological correlates of schizophrenia symptoms. This observation may shed some light on the controversial hypothesis of marijuana use as self-medication in schizophrenic patients."

Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed 1880 screening AB-MRIs in 763 women with a PH of breast cancer (median age, 55 years; range, 23–89 years) between October 2015 and October 2016. The total acquisition times of AB-MRI were 8.3 min and 2.8 min with and without T2-weighted imaging, respectively. The tissue diagnosis or one-year follow-up status was used as the reference standard. The characteristics of tumor recurrences detected on AB-MRI screenings were analyzed. The cancer detection rates (CDRs) and additional CDRs for the 1st round and overall rounds of AB-MRI screening were calculated. The recall rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values for recall (PPV1) and biopsy (PPV3) for the 1st round of AB-MRI screening were calculated. The diagnostic performance of the combination of mammography and ultrasonography was compared with that of AB-MRI by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results Fifteen of a total of 21 recurrences were detected on the 1st round of AB-MRI screening: 93.3% were node-negative T1 tumors (median tumor size, 1.02 cm; range, 0.1–2 cm) or Tis; 66.7% were high-grade tumors; 8 of these 15 were mammographically and ultrasonographically occult. The CDR and additional CDR for the 1st round of AB-MRI screening were 0.019 and 0.010 per woman, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, recall rate, PPV1 and PPV3 for the 1st round of AB-MRI screening were 100%, 96.0%, 14.3%, 13.8% and 58.3%, respectively. For detecting secondary cancer, AB-MRI showed a higher sensitivity and PPV than the combination of mammography and ultrasonography (95.2%, 57.1% vs 47.6%, 38.5%). The area under the ROC curve was higher for AB-MRI (0.966; 95% CI: 0.951–0.978) than the combination of mammography and ultrasonography (0.727; 95% CI: 0.694–0.759) (P<0.0001). Conclusion AB-MRI improved cancer detection with a high specificity, sensitivity and PPV in women with a PH of breast cancer. AB-MRI could be a useful screening tool for detecting secondary cancer considering its high diagnostic performance and short examination time."
https://openalex.org/W3011040856,"The spread of dengue through global human mobility is a major public health concern. A key challenge is understanding the transmission pathways and mediating factors that characterized the patterns of dengue importation into non-endemic areas. Utilizing a network connectivity-based approach, we analyze the importation patterns of dengue fever into European countries. Seven connectivity indices were developed to characterize the role of the air passenger traffic, seasonality, incidence rate, geographical proximity, epidemic vulnerability, and wealth of a source country, in facilitating the transport and importation of dengue fever. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the relationship between dengue importation and the connectivity indices while accounting for the air transport network structure. We also incorporated network autocorrelation within a GLMM framework to investigate the propensity of a European country to receive an imported case, by virtue of its position within the air transport network. The connectivity indices and dynamical processes of the air transport network were strong predictors of dengue importation in Europe. With more than 70% of the variation in dengue importation patterns explained. We found that transportation potential was higher for source countries with seasonal dengue activity, high passenger traffic, high incidence rates, high epidemic vulnerability, and in geographical proximity to a destination country in Europe. We also found that position of a European country within the air transport network was a strong predictor of the country's propensity to receive an imported case. Our findings provide evidence that the importation patterns of dengue into Europe can be largely explained by appropriately characterizing the heterogeneities of the source, and topology of the air transport network. This contributes to the foundational framework for building integrated predictive models for bio-surveillance of dengue importation."
https://openalex.org/W3012160283,"Previous studies on joint kinetics during track and field block starts have been limited to lower-limb sagittal kinetics; however, we hypothesised that lumbopelvic extensors, lateral flexors, and hip abductors also act as substantial energy generators. The present study aimed to examine the three-dimensional lumbo-pelvic-hip kinetics to better understand the generation of mechanical energy during a block start. 3D kinematic and force data during block starts of 10 m maximal sprinting in 12 male sprinters (personal best in a 100 m sprint, 10.78 ± 0.19 s [range, 10.43-11.01 s]) were captured using a motion capture system and force platform. The three-dimensional lumbo-pelvic-hip kinetics were calculated. The peak lumbosacral extension torque (3.64 ± 0.39 Nm/kg) was significantly larger than any other lower-limb and lumbosacral torques (<3.0 Nm/kg). It was suggested that large lumbopelvic extension torques are needed during the block start to anchor the pelvis by cancelling out both hip extension torques acting on the pelvis, leading to hip extensor-induced thigh sagittal rotations rather than pelvic posterior tilt. During the double-stance phase, the lumbosacral extensors generated mechanical energy (0.35 ± 0.16 J/kg, 14 ± 4% of the sum of lumbosacral and lower-limb net joint work). During the single-stance phase, the sum of the net mechanical work by lumbosacral lateral flexors and front hip abductors was 0.35 ± 0.14 J/kg, which comprised 9 ± 3% of the sum of the net joint work. The results lead to the speculation of the importance of strengthening not only the leg extensors, but also the lumbopelvic extensors, lateral flexors, and hip abductors for block starts. Further training studies to verify this speculation will improve training strategies for the track and field block start performance."
https://openalex.org/W3012353078,"Introduction In patients with ascending aortic (AA) aneurysms, prosthetic graft replacement yields benefit but risk for complications in the descending aorta persists. Longitudinal impact of AA grafts on native descending aortic physiology is poorly understood. Methods Transthoracic echocardiograms (echo) in patients undergoing AA elective surgical grafting were analyzed: Descending aortic deformation indices included global circumferential strain (GCS), time to peak (TTP) strain, and fractional area change (FAC). Computed tomography (CT) was used to assess aortic wall thickness and calcification. Results 46 patients undergoing AA grafting were studied; 65% had congenital or genetically-associated AA (30% bicuspid valve, 22% Marfan, 13% other): After grafting (6.4±7.5 months), native descending aortic distension increased, irrespective of whether assessed based on circumferential strain or area-based methods (both p<0.001). Increased distensibility paralleled altered kinetics, as evidenced by decreased time to peak strain (p = 0.01) and increased velocity (p = 0.002). Augmented distensibility and flow velocity occurred despite similar pre- and post-graft blood pressure and medications (all p = NS), and was independent of pre-surgical aortic regurgitation or change in left ventricular stroke volume (both p = NS). Magnitude of change in GCS and FAC was 5–10 fold greater among patients with congenital or genetically associated AA vs. degenerative AA (p<0.001), paralleling larger descending aortic size, greater wall thickness, and higher prevalence of calcific atherosclerotic plaque in the degenerative group (all p<0.05). In multivariate analysis, congenital/genetically associated AA etiology conferred a 4-fold increment in magnitude of augmented native descending aortic strain after proximal grafting (B = 4.19 [CI 1.6, 6.8]; p = 0.002) independent of age and descending aortic size. Conclusions Prosthetic graft replacement of the ascending aorta increases magnitude and rapidity of distal aortic distension. Graft effects are greatest with congenital or genetically associated AA, providing a potential mechanism for increased energy transmission to the native descending aorta and adverse post-surgical aortic remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W3010907814,"The assessment of language lateralization has become widely used when planning neurosurgery close to language areas, due to individual specificities and potential influence of brain pathology. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows non-invasive and quantitative assessment of language lateralization for presurgical planning using a laterality index (LI). However, the conventional method is limited by the dependence of the LI on the chosen activation threshold. To overcome this limitation, different threshold-independent LI calculations have been reported. The purpose of this study was to propose a simplified approach to threshold-independent LI calculation and compare it with three previously reported methods on the same cohort of subjects. Fifteen healthy subjects, who performed picture naming, verb generation, and word fluency tasks, were scanned. LI values were calculated for all subjects using four methods, and considering either the whole hemisphere or an atlas-defined language area. For each method, the subjects were ranked according to the calculated LI values, and the obtained rankings were compared. All LI calculation methods agreed in differentiating strong from weak lateralization on both hemispheric and regional scales (Spearman’s correlation coefficients 0.59–1.00). In general, a more lateralized activation was found in the language area than in the whole hemisphere. The new method is well suited for application in the clinical practice as it is simple to implement, fast, and robust. The good agreement between LI calculation methods suggests that the choice of method is not key. Nevertheless, it should be consistent to allow a relative comparison of language lateralization between subjects."
https://openalex.org/W3011266573,"Maternal mortality remains a major challenge to health systems in low and middle-incoming countries. Some pregnant women develop potentially life-threatening complications during childbirth. Therefore, home delivery is a precursor for maternal mortality. In this study, we aimed at not only estimating the percentage of deliveries occurring at home and examining the factors associated with home delivery, but we also explored the reasons for home delivery among women in rural Ghana.The study was conducted among mothers with delivery experience in selected communities in the Builsa South district located in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) guide respectively. A total of 456 mothers participated in this study. Regression models were used in the quantitative analysis whereas a thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the qualitative data.Of the 423 mothers in the quantitative research, 38.1% (95% CI: 33.5-42.8) delivered their index child at home. In adjusted analysis, women who were not exposed to information (AOR = 13.64, p<0.001) and women with 2 (AOR = 4.64, p = 0.014), 3 (AOR = 4.96, p = 0.025) or at least 4 living children (AOR = 9.59, p = 0.001) had higher odds of delivering at home. From the qualitative analysis, the poor attitude of nurses (midwives), lack of, and cost of transportation, cost of delivery kits, and traditional beliefs and practices were cited as reasons for home delivery.Despite the government's efforts to provide free maternal care services to women in Ghana, a significant proportion of rural women still deliver at home due to other 'hidden costs'. Addressing poor staff attitude, transportation challenges, and negative traditional beliefs and practices through awareness creation may contribute to improving health facility delivery by rural pregnant women in Ghana."

Yaviichnus inyooensis igen. isp. nov. is composed of main large chambers near the top of the paleosol, from which shafts showing different morphologies and orientations radiate, some of them ending in or connected to small deeper chambers. Gregorymys spp. is proposed as the producer based on its fossorial habits, abundance in the outcrops, presence of remains inside the burrows, and paired grooves in the walls, which are compatible with the traces of geomyid incisors. The complexity of these burrows attests to an extended underground life that would have been triggered by semiarid to arid conditions. Morphological complexity also suggests that the burrows were excavated and inhabited by more than one individual, indicating that Oligocene Gregorymys of southern Mexico would be a unique gregarious geomyid."
https://openalex.org/W3011381358,"The prognostic role of gender in patients with liver cirrhosis is not fully understood. Our primary aim was to assess how gender affects cumulative incidence and risk of death without liver transplantation (LT) in cirrhotic patients with gastroesophageal varices. Secondary aims were to assess the relationship between gender and cause specific death, risk of variceal bleeding and incidence rates of gastroesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis.All new patients with gastroesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis at Oslo University Hospital between 2006 and May 2016 were identified. Clinical data were retrieved retrospectively from hospital files. Causes of death were classified according to a specified protocol in cases of in-hospital-death, otherwise by data from the Norwegian Death Registry. Competing risk analyses were used to calculate cumulative incidences and risks of i) all-cause death, ii) cause-specific death and iii) variceal bleeding or re-bleeding.Cumulative one- and five years incidence of death without LT in 266 included patients were 28% and 51%, respectively. In univariate analysis, risk of death was positively associated with age, Child Pugh class, alcoholic liver disease and presentation with variceal bleeding, and negatively associated with female sex. In a multivariate model, risk of death without LT was associated with female sex (SHR 0.59 [0.40-0.86]), age (SHR 1.05 [1.04-1.07] per year), Child Pugh class B (SHR 1.54 [1.03-2.32]) and Child Pugh class C (SHR 4.29 [2.57-7.17]). Variceal bleeding caused 27% of deaths. Adjusting for age and Child Pugh score, a trend towards reduced risk of death due to variceal bleeding was seen in women (SHR 0.53; [0.26-1.06]). High alcohol consumption was associated with increased risk of first variceal bleeding, both at univariate analysis (SHR 7.73 [1.71-34.9]) and multivariate analysis (SHR 13.9 [2.51-77.0]).Reduced mortality due to variceal bleeding may contribute to improved survival without LT in cirrhotic women with gastroesophageal varices."
https://openalex.org/W3011353256,"Background Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurologic disorder which affects an estimated 10.5 million children worldwide. Despite the burden, the scarcity of study held in Ethiopia. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the treatment outcomes of epilepsy and its root causes in children with epilepsy. Methods A hospital-based retrospective cohort study was conducted from October 10/2017 up to October 10/2018. A total of 210 study participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were included in the study. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire with a document review was used to collect data. The data were entered into Epi Info version 7.2.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Descriptive statistics were computed. Simple logistic analysis was run (at 95% CI and p-value < 0.05) to identify factors associated with treatment outcome. Result 210 eligible patients with epilepsy were recruited for the study. About half of the respondents were females and the majority was within the age group of 5–10 years. Phenobarbital has been the most frequently prescribed drugs and thirteen percent of patients were in the escalation phase of treatment. Eight percent of the study participants had poor adherence to the treatment regimen. About six percent of the study subjects were suffering from an uncontrolled seizure. Being a female child (AOR = 2. 21; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.41) and excellent adherence to anti-epilepsy treatment (AOR = 4. 51; 95%CI: 1.53, 13.42) were significantly associated with treatment outcome. Conclusion This study revealed that many children were suffering from uncontrolled seizure and escalation therapy is being exercised. Being a female child and adherence to anti-epilepsy treatment were significantly associated with treatment outcome. Therefore, attention should be given to adherence counseling to convey a better treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3011497897,"Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes chronic atrophic gastritis and peptic ulcers and it has been associated with the development of gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). One of the more remarkable characteristics of H. pylori is its ability to survive in the hostile environment of the stomach. H. pylori regulates the expression of specific sets of genes allowing it to survive high acidity levels and nutrient scarcity. In the present study, we determined the expression of virulence associated protein D (VapD) of H. pylori inside adenocarcinoma gastric (AGS) cells and in gastric biopsies. Using qRT-PCR, VapD expression was quantified in intracellular H. pylori-AGS cell cultures at different time points and in gastric mucosa biopsies from patients suffering from chronic atrophic gastritis, follicular gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastritis precancerous intestinal metaplasia and adenocarcinoma. Our results show that vapD of H. pylori presented high transcription levels inside AGS cells, which increased up to two-fold above basal values across all assays over time. Inside AGS cells, H. pylori acquired a coccoid form that is metabolically active in expressing VapD as a protection mechanism, thereby maintaining its permanence in a viable non-cultivable state. VapD of H. pylori was expressed in all gastric biopsies, however, higher expression levels (p = 0.029) were observed in gastric antrum biopsies from patients with follicular gastritis. The highest VapD expression levels were found in both antrum and corpus gastric biopsies from older patients (>57 years old). We observed that VapD in H. pylori is a protein that is only produced in response to interactions with eukaryotic cells. Our results suggest that VapD contributes to the persistence of H. pylori inside the gastric epithelial cells, protecting the microorganism from the intracellular environment, reducing its growth rate, enabling long-term infection and treatment resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3012014187,"Epidermal morphogenesis and hair follicle (HF) development depend on the ability of keratinocytes to adhere to the basement membrane (BM) and migrate along the extracellular matrix. Integrins are cell-matrix receptors that control keratinocyte adhesion and migration, and are recognized as major regulators of epidermal homeostasis. How integrins regulate the behavior of keratinocytes during epidermal morphogenesis remains insufficiently understood. Here, we show that α-parvin (α-pv), a focal adhesion protein that couples integrins to actin cytoskeleton, is indispensable for epidermal morphogenesis and HF development. Inactivation of the murine α-pv gene in basal keratinocytes results in keratinocyte-BM detachment, epidermal thickening, ectopic keratinocyte proliferation and altered actin cytoskeleton polarization. In vitro, α-pv-null keratinocytes display reduced adhesion to BM matrix components, aberrant spreading and stress fibers formation, and impaired directed migration. Together, our data demonstrate that α-pv controls epidermal homeostasis by facilitating integrin-mediated adhesion and actin cytoskeleton organization in keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3012036413,"Background Twin infants are likely at great risk for ROP, but studies reported conflicting findings and population studies examining the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in twins is limited. We aimed to evaluate the ROP risk in the cohort of one of twins, comparing to singletons. Material and methods Using insurance claims data of a half of children in Taiwan ages 18 and less, we established a twin cohort (N = 27830) born in 1998–2009 and a randomly selected singleton cohort (N = 111080) frequency matched by sex, birth year, residential area and parental occupation and followed up to 2012 years. Results The overall incidence rate of ROP was 13.6-fold greater in the twin cohort than in the singleton cohort (35.1 vs. 2.58 per 10,000 person-years; adjusted HR = 13.4, 95% CI = 11.7–15.3; p <0.0001). The ROP incidence was slightly higher in boys than in girls, higher in children in more urbanized areas and born to mothers without works. The incident ROP increased with decreasing birthweight. For children with birthweight <1000 grams, the ROP incidence was 1.2-fold greater in the twin cohort than in the singleton cohort (1243.2 vs. 1016.3 per 10,000 person-years). The use of mechanical ventilation was associated with increased ROP risk for both cohorts, particularly for infants who were under invasive treatment. Conclusion Infants who were born as twins or born with low birthweight were at an elevated risk of developing ROP. Extreme cautious and close monitor are required for new born with low birthweight and have undergone with mechanical ventilation."

Thirty-nine patients had unilateral BRVO (BRVO group), 36 patients had NTG (NTG group), and 36 patients had vitreous floaters, but no other ocular diseases (control group). In addition to baseline characteristics such as age, sex, refractive errors, the ocular characteristics such as peripapillary choroidal thickness (PCT), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and subfoveal choroidal thickness were retrospectively analyzed.Focal LC defects were detected in 20 eyes of 14 patients (38.9%) in the BRVO group, 24 eyes of 15 patients (41.7%) in the NTG group, and none in the control group (P<0.001). In the BRVO-affected eyes, the mean PCT was 102.7±31.1 μm in the eyes with focal LC defects, and 163.1±70.1 μm in the eyes without LC defects (P = 0.009). In the BRVO-affected eyes, the mean PCT was 102.7±31.1 μm in the eyes with focal LC defects, and 163.1±70.1 μm in the eyes without LC defects (P = 0.009). In the NTG group, the mean PCT was 133.1±48.9 μm in the eyes with focal LC defects and 170.8±81.9 μm in those without (P = 0.042). The other baseline and ocular characteristics were not significantly different between the eyes with and without focal LC defects in both the BRVO group and the NTG group.About 40% of the patients with unilateral BRVO had focal LC defect in the BRVO-affected eyes and unaffected fellow eyes, similar prevalence to the patients with NTG. The mean PCT was significantly thinner in the eyes with focal LC defect than those without in the patients with BRVO and those with NTG, suggesting possible pathophysiologic correlation between these two diseases."

https://openalex.org/W3012258652,"We previously reported that overexpression of cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1 (CYP24A1) increases lung cancer cell proliferation by activating RAS signaling and that CYP24A1 knockdown inhibits tumor growth. However, the mechanism of CYP24A1-mediated cancer cell proliferation remains unclear. Here, we conducted cell synchronization and biochemical experiments in lung adenocarcinoma cells, revealing a link between CYP24A1 and anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a key cell cycle regulator. We demonstrate that CYP24A1 expression is cell cycle–dependent; it was higher in the G2-M phase and diminished upon G1 entry. CYP24A1 has a functional destruction box (D-box) motif that allows binding with two APC adaptors, CDC20-homologue 1 (CDH1) and cell division cycle 20 (CDC20). Unlike other APC substrates, however, CYP24A1 acted as a pseudo-substrate, inhibiting CDH1 activity and promoting mitotic progression. Conversely, overexpression of a CYP24A1 D-box mutant compromised CDH1 binding, allowing CDH1 hyperactivation, thereby hastening degradation of its substrates cyclin B1 and CDC20, and accumulation of the CDC20 substrate p21, prolonging mitotic exit. These activities also occurred with a CYP24A1 isoform 2 lacking the catalytic cysteine (Cys-462), suggesting that CYP24A1's oncogenic potential is independent of its catalytic activity. CYP24A1 degradation reduced clonogenic survival of mutant KRAS-driven lung cancer cells, and calcitriol treatment increased CYP24A1 levels and tumor burden in Lsl-KRASG12D mice. These results disclose a catalytic activity-independent growth-promoting role of CYP24A1 in mutant KRAS-driven lung cancer.

However, for the majority of tumors, the genetic drivers are still poorly defined with limited treatment options.

However, the molecular regulators involved in CYP-mediated regulation of cell proliferation is yet unclear. Several cell cycle regulators, particularly the cyclins, contain consensus amino acid sequence (RXXLXXXN/D/E, where X could be any amino acid) termed the destruction box, or D-box. This sequence is recognized by a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C). 6The abbreviations used are: APC/Canaphase-promoting complex or cyclosomeD#198RMKLGSFE105D#2223RFGLLQKN230ACadenocarcinoma.

Although CYP24A1 has been recognized as an oncogene in multiple cancer types, all targeting efforts have been focused on modulating enzymatic activity.

Studies testing nonselective CYP catalytic inhibitor (ketoconazole) demonstrated limited benefit (19Patel V. Liaw B. Oh W. The role of ketoconazole in current prostate cancer care.Nat. Rev.

We describe experiments that establish the importance of the physical presence (as opposed to the catalytic activity) of CYP24A1 in lung cancer progression that can inform strategies to physically abolish CYP24A1.

Marcus C.B. Iversen P.L. Alternative splicing in the cytochrome P450 superfamily expands protein diversity to augment gene function and redirect human drug metabolism.Drug Metab. Dispos. 2017; 45 (28188297): 375-38910.1124/dmd.116.073254Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We previously reported that CYP24A1 overexpression enhances lung cancer cell proliferation (8Shiratsuchi H. Wang Z. Chen G. Ray P. Lin J. Zhang Z. Zhao L. Beer D. Ray D. Ramnath N. Oncogenic potential of CYP24A1 in lung adenocarcinoma.J. Thorac.

However, we had not assessed the relative contribution of catalytic activity on proliferation. CYP24A1 is predicted to express multiple isoforms. Among those, isoform 1 (Iso1) with 11 exons is the full-length (514 amino acids) and the most abundant isoform with vitamin D catalytic activity. An alternate isoform (Iso2) lacks exon 10, encoding heme-binding domain and the catalytic cysteine (Cys-462), thereby unable to catalyze vitamin D. As reported in prostate (21Muindi J.R. Nganga A.

Analysis of matched tumor and normal profiles reveals common transcriptional and epigenetic signals shared across cancer types.PLoS One. 2015; 10 (26555223): e014261810.1371/journal.pone.0142618Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Peng L.

Rep. 2015; 5 (26292924): 1341310.1038/srep13413Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To understand the impact of isoform-specific overexpression of CYP24A1 on cell proliferation we overexpressed either DDK- or V5-tagged Iso1 and Iso2, respectively, in SK-Lu1 and Hcc827 cells (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of CYP24A1 in mutant KRAS containing human lung adenocarcinoma, SK-Lu1 cells (with undetectable levels of endogenous CYP24A1), showed increased proliferation compared with vector control assessed using cell counting and MTT assays (Fig. 1C). In comparison, Iso2 also showed increased proliferative potential, suggesting that CYP24A1 cell proliferating ability is independent of its catalytic activity. Surprisingly, in Hcc827 cells (WT KRAS), overexpression of CYP24A1 (either Iso1 or Iso2) reduced proliferation rates, suggesting a cooperativity between mutant KRAS and CYP24A1 (Fig. 1D). To determine whether CYP24A1 has any direct role in cell cycle, we examined the levels of endogenous CYP24A1 protein in HeLa cells synchronized by double thymidine block and release (Fig. 1E), a validated model for such studies. The expression of CYP24A1 was highest 8–10 h after release and decreased promptly by 12 h, which closely matched the expression pattern of mitotic cyclin B1 expression (Fig. 1F). As there are no isoform-specific CYP24A1 antibodies currently available, we performed synchronization and release experiments in SK-Lu1 cells (a lung adenocarcinoma cell line with mutant KRAS and undetected levels of CYP24A1) stably expressing V5-tagged Iso2. Using V5 antibody, we observed increases in CYP24A1 protein at 4 and 14 h following double thymidine block and release, which again mirrored cyclin B1 expression (Fig. 1G). Cellular DNA content analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) revealed that the cells expressing highest Iso2-V5 were in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and decreased upon exit (Fig. 1H). Together, we conclude that CYP24A1 including the Iso2 is a cell cycle–regulated protein that accumulates during G2/M, subsequently undergoing degradation while exiting mitosis. As CYP24A1 expression closely overlapped with cell cycle-dependent expression of cyclin B1, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of CYP24A1 and identified two D-boxes (98RMKLGSFE105 and 223RFGLLQKN230), hereby referred to as D#1 and D#2, respectively (Fig. 2A). Both D-boxes are conserved among vertebrates including human, mouse, rat, and zebrafish. Phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome P450 family members grouped CYP24A1 closer to CYP11A1, 1A1, and 17A1 family members with previously reported roles in cell proliferation (Fig. 2B). Primary amino acid sequence analysis further revealed the presence of D-boxes (Fig. 2B) in the aforementioned members as well as in few others (2A6, 21A2, etc.), which supports a common mechanistic involvement in cell cycle regulation using a common regulatory domain (D-box). To understand the functional importance of D-boxes in CYP24A1, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis using the V5 antibody and noted stable interactions of CYP24A1-Iso2 with both APC/CCDH1 and APC/CCDC20 (Fig. 2, C and D). Mutation of Arg-98 and Lys-101 of the D#1 to alanine (A) had no impact on CYP24A1–CDH1 interaction (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). While analyzing the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) database, we identified mutations at Arg-223 and Lys-226 positions of D#2. We, therefore, mutated both Arg-223 and Lys-226 to alanine (A) and tested the mutant CYP24A1 interaction with APC/C, where we noted reduced interaction with the D#2 mutant, demonstrating the importance of CYP24A1 D#2 (Fig. 2D, lanes 5–7). D-box–containing proteins appear to be either substrates (able to bind and be ubiquitinated and degraded by APC) or pseudo-substrates (able to bind but not be ubiquitinated and degraded by APC; however, this binding competitively blocks the degradation of other CDH1 substrates). We tested the steady state levels of WT CYP24A1 protein in the presence and absence of CDH1. A dose-dependent increase of CDH1 failed to down-regulate CYP24A1-Iso2; instead, an increase in steady state level was noted, suggesting it may not be a true APC/C substrate (Fig. 2E). Using in vivo ubiquitination assay using CDC20 as a CDH1 substrate (25Hyun S.Y. Sarantuya B. Lee H.J. Jang Y.J. APC/C(Cdh1)-dependent degradation of Cdc20 requires a phosphorylation on CRY-box by Polo-like kinase-1 during somatic cell cycle.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 436 (23643811): 12-1810.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.073Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we discovered that CYP24A1-WT overexpression inhibits CDH1-mediated CDC20 polyubiquitination, whereas, D#2 mutant overexpression resulted in CDC20 hyperpolyubiquitination (Fig. 2F). Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay where a 1–102 amino acid fragment of cyclin B1 (a known CDH1 substrate) was incubated with APC-CDH1 complex (immunoprecipitated from G1-synchronized HeLa cells), we noted a robust polyubiquitination of purified cyclin B1 fragment, which was significantly inhibited upon addition of increasing concentrations of recombinant CYP24A1-Iso2 (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, the D#2 mutant protein half-life was shorter (∼60 min) compared with ∼240 min for WT Iso2 protein (Fig. 2, H and I), suggesting the D#2 box may not be a degradation signal for CYP24A1 but instead acts as a pseudo-substrate to regulate APCCDH1 activity. Upon D#2 mutation, loss of its interaction with APC/C contributed to faster decay by a yet unknown E3 ligase. As we discovered CYP24A1's ability to inhibit APC/CCDH1 ubiquitin ligase activity, we next addressed the effect of CYP24A1 expression on cell cycle progression. For this study, SK-Lu1 cells stably expressing either WT or D#2 mutant were used. The cells were then synchronized using double thymidine block followed by release. As shown in Fig. 3A, in all three groups (vector, WT, and D#2 mutant) within 4-h post thymidine release, a significant percentage (35–45%) of cells entered the first round of mitosis. Within 6–8 h post release, although the majority of cells from the vector control and Iso2 WT expressing groups exited mitosis and entered next round of G1 phase, about 10–15% of SK-Lu1 cells expressing D#2 mutant failed to exit mitosis. Furthermore, cells expressing Iso2 WT entered the second round of mitosis by 12 h post thymidine release (14 h in case of vector transfected SK-Lu1 cells), illustrating the growth promoting potential of WT CYP24A1-Iso2 expression. In contrast, a majority of cells expressing D#2 mutant failed to exit mitosis, and by 14–24 h post thymidine release, a gradual increase (4–10%) of cells with sub-G1 DNA content were detected using FACS, suggestive of cell death (Fig. 3B). Under phase-contrast microscope we have similarly noted death of cells undergoing mitosis (not shown). While analyzing cell lysates (Fig. 3C), we noted several differences in SK-Lu1 cells expressing D#2 mutant compared with CYP24A1 WT: (i) diminished cyclin B1 accumulation (ii) diminished CDC20 levels, whereas, (iii) an increased accumulation of p21 was observed. These findings led us to propose a model (Fig. 3D) where we hypothesize CYP24A1 acts as a major APC/CCDH1 regulator. Reduced interaction between CDH1 and CYP24A1 D#2 mutant allows hyperactivation of CDH1, which in turn degrades cyclin B1 and CDC20, the two established CDH1 substrates. With reduced cyclin B1 accumulation, mitotic progression is possibly hindered. Additionally, reduced CDC20 levels, a ligase responsible for p21 degradation during mitotic exit (26Amador V. Ge S. Santamaría P.G. Guardavaccaro D. Pagano M. APC/C(Cdc20) controls the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p21 in prometaphase.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27 (17679094): 462-47310.1016/j.molcel.2007.06.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), allows p21 to accumulate in an untimely fashion, resulting in the inability to exit mitosis, and instead promotes cell death via mitotic catastrophe. Together, we demonstrate that CYP24A1 is a key participant in nuclear division. As overexpression of CYP24A1-Iso2 (lacking catalytic Cys-462 residue) promotes tumor cell proliferation, and as we previously reported that siRNA/shRNA-mediated loss of CYP24A1 reduces clonogenic survival and inhibits tumor growth of mutant KRAS-containing lung cancer cell lines (8Shiratsuchi H. Wang Z. Chen G. Ray P. Lin J. Zhang Z. Zhao L. Beer D. Ray D. Ramnath N. Oncogenic potential of CYP24A1 in lung adenocarcinoma.J. Thorac.

Our studies indicated that oncogenicity of CYP24A1 is mediated via increased RAS signaling (8Shiratsuchi H. Wang Z. Chen G. Ray P. Lin J. Zhang Z. Zhao L. Beer D. Ray D. Ramnath N. Oncogenic potential of CYP24A1 in lung adenocarcinoma.J. Thorac. Oncol. 2017; 12 (27793774): 269-28010.1016/j.jtho.2016.10.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We therefore tested a combination of MEK inhibitor and statin that has previously been shown to decrease the expression of CYP24A1 (27Sakaki T. Yasuda K. Kittaka A. Yamamoto K. Chen T.C. CYP24A1 as a potential target for cancer therapy.Anti-Cancer Agents Med. Chem. 2014; 14 (23869781): 97-10810.2174/18715206113139990307Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additionally, statins have been shown to overcome MEK inhibitor resistance by suppressing AKT activation in cancer cells (28Iizuka-Ohashi M. Watanabe M. Sukeno M. Morita M. Hoang N.T.H. Kuchimaru T. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Sowa Y. Sakaguchi K. Taguchi T. Sakai T. Blockage of the mevalonate pathway overcomes the apoptotic resistance to MEK inhibitors with suppressing the activation of Akt in cancer cells.Oncotarget. 2018; 9 (29731968): 19597-1961210.18632/oncotarget.24696Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We tested the effects of MEK inhibitors alone or in combination with simvastatin on CYP24A1 steady state levels. When human lung adenocarcinoma (NCI-H441) cells overexpressing CYP24A1-Iso2-V5 were treated either with a MEKi (PD98059) or simvastatin, there was minimal impact on CYP24A1 levels. Interestingly, a combination of PD98059 and simvastatin significantly reduced (80% loss) CYP24A1 levels compared with control (Fig. 4, A and C, and Fig. S1), which was rescued by treating cells with a proteasomal inhibitor, MG132. Consequently, this drug combination reduced the clonogenic survival of this mutant KRAS-driven cell line (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with another mutant KRAS-driven NCI-H727 line (data not shown). In mutant KRAS-independent A549 cells, a similar drug combination failed to reduce clonogenic survival (Fig. S2A), where we noted higher levels of activated AKT compared with more sensitive NCI-H441 cells (Fig. S2B). In a parallel experiment, treatment of mouse pancreatic cell lines carrying doxycycline-inducible mutant KRASG12D alleles when treated with calcitriol, an active form of vitamin D, enhanced cell proliferation and survival (Fig. 4, D and E) with concomitant induction of CYP24A1 (Fig. 4F). However, in WT KRAS containing Hcc827 cells, calcitriol treatment inhibited proliferation and clonogenic survival (Fig. 4, G and H) with induction of CYP24A1 (Fig. 4I). We noted similar outcome upon overexpression of CYP24A1 Iso1 and Iso2 in Hcc827 cells (Fig. 1D). Together, we hypothesize that CYP24A1 protein levels may be critical for tumor cell proliferation, where mutant KRAS dependence may be critical. To test such a hypothesis in vivo, we used lox-STOP-lox-KrasG12D mouse lung cancer model (29Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Montoya R. Jacks T. Tuveson D.A. Analysis of lung tumor initiation and progression using conditional expression of oncogenic K-ras.Genes Dev. 2001; 15 (11751630): 3243-324810.1101/gad.943001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) where tissue- and/or time-dependent expression of Cre recombinase removes the STOP cassette and allows expression of the mutated Kras allele. Intranasal infection with an adenovirus encoding Cre results in a high frequency of lung tumors within 18–20 weeks post infection. To study tumor growth noninvasively, we crossed this mouse with an Lsl-Rosa26-Luciferase mouse to generate a compound transgenic model, where KrasG12D transcription coincides with Luciferase expression in a tissue-specific manner (30Bowman B.M.

In that study we demonstrated that bioluminescence imaging is sensitive in detecting tumor burden as early as week 13 post Adeno-Cre expression, which correlated with micro-CT imaging captured at week 18. To induce CYP24A1, calcitriol (0.625 μg/kg, i.p. every other day) was injected starting 48 h post Adeno-Cre infection. Tumor development was monitored noninvasively using bioluminescence imaging. As shown in Fig. 5A, bioluminescence (-fold change) was 2 fold higher in calcitriol-treated group compared with vehicle control (n = 4 per group). Similar increase in tumor burden was observed in calcitriol-treated group when mice were subjected to micro-CT imaging (Fig. 5B). At the completion of study after 20 weeks post virus infection, H&E staining confirmed bioluminescence imaging and micro-CT findings (Fig. 5C). Tumor cell lysates isolated 2 weeks post calcitriol treatment showed compensatory up-regulation of CYP24A1 compared with vehicle control (Fig. 5D). Together, we show that in Lsl-KrasG12D mice calcitriol treatment induces CYP24A1 to enhance tumor growth.Figure 5Calcitriol treatment up-regulates CYP24A1 levels and increases tumor burden in Lsl-KrasG12D mouse lung tumor model.

https://openalex.org/W3011921644,"A long noted hypothesis is that mechanisms of dreaming play a role in psychotic hallucinations. One challenge for this hypothesis is that while psychotic hallucinations primarily are auditory, dreaming most characteristically is visual. At the same time, previous studies have not explicitly examined auditory impressions in dreaming. Here, we mapped the prevalence and characteristics of auditory impressions in 130 dreams reported after spontaneous awakenings from sleep in 13 normal, healthy people. We instructed participants to report any dream they could recall and to pay particular attention to possible auditory impressions. The participants reported auditory impressions in 93.9% of their dreams on average. The most prevalent auditory type was other people speaking (83.9% of participants' dreams), followed by the dreamer speaking (60.0%), and other types of sounds (e.g. music, 33.1%). Of altogether 407 instances of auditory impressions in the 130 dreams, auditory quality was judged comparable to waking in 46.4%, indeterminate in 50.6%, and absent or only thought-like in 2.9%. The results suggest that also internally generated auditory (verbal) sensations are a central component of dreaming, typically occurring several times every night in normal, healthy people."
https://openalex.org/W3010964145,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules that regulate target gene expression in various organisms. Functional studies are therefore required to determine their temporal and spatial expression patterns. Primer extension has been used as a sensitive and reliable approach to identify miRNAs (∼21-22 nt) in the mammalian system and can be used in other systems such as plants. However, a well-defined method is required for ease of application and reproducibility. Here, a radioactive primer extension method was developed for the quantitative detection of miRNAs found in total RNA samples from plants. As a proof of concept, miR173 and miR828 were detected by primer extension in total RNA samples isolated from Arabidopsis. The assay involved the extension reaction of the miRNA guide strand with a radiolabeled specific primer. Using a manual DNA sequencer, primers extended with reverse transcriptase were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for size-dependent product identification up to a single base difference. Quantification was done based on the intensity of radioactive signals by normalizing the cDNA products to an internal control. The primer extension was proven to be efficient to detect and quantify miRNAs in plant total RNA samples without subsequent enrichment of low-molecular-weight RNA species. This method, optimized for Arabidopsis, can be applied to a wide variety of organisms for the detection and quantification of miRNAs as well as siRNAs."
