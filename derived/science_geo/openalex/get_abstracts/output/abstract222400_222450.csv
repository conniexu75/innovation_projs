https://openalex.org/W1990317973,"Aurora kinase A (also called STK15 and BTAK) is overexpressed in many human cancers. Ectopic overexpression of aurora kinase A in mammalian cells induces centrosome amplification, chromosome instability and oncogenic transformation, a phenotype characteristic of loss-of-function mutations of p53. Here we show that aurora kinase A phosphorylates p53 at Ser315, leading to its ubiquitination by Mdm2 and proteolysis. p53 is not degraded in the presence of inactive aurora kinase A or ubiquitination-defective Mdm2. Destabilization of p53 by aurora kinase A is abrogated in the presence of mutant Mdm2 that is unable to bind p53 and after repression of Mdm2 by RNA interference. Silencing of aurora kinase A results in less phosphorylation of p53 at Ser315, greater stability of p53 and cell-cycle arrest at G2-M. Cells depleted of aurora kinase A are more sensitive to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and elevated expression of aurora kinase A abolishes this response. In a sample of bladder tumors with wild-type p53, elevated expression of aurora kinase A was correlated with low p53 concentration. We conclude that aurora kinase A is a key regulatory component of the p53 pathway and that overexpression of aurora kinase A leads to increased degradation of p53, causing downregulation of checkpoint-response pathways and facilitating oncogenic transformation of cells."

Hydroxylation of specific proline residues by HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases targets the HIF-α subunit for proteasomal destruction, whereas hydroxylation of an asparagine in the C-terminal transactivation domain prevents its interaction with the transcriptional coactivator p300. The HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase is identical to a previously known factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). We report here that recombinant FIH has unique catalytic and inhibitory properties when compared with those of the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases. FIH was found to require particularly long peptide substrates so that omission of only a few residues from the N or C terminus of a 35-residue HIF-1α sequence markedly reduced its substrate activity. Hydroxylation of two HIF-2α peptides was far less efficient than that of the corresponding HIF-1α peptides. The Km of FIH for O2 was about 40% of its atmospheric concentration, being about one-third of those of the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases but 2.5 times that of the type I collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Several 2-oxoglutarate analogs were found to inhibit FIH but with distinctly different potencies from the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases. For example, the two most potent HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors among the compounds studied were the least effective ones for FIH. It should therefore be possible to develop specific small molecule inhibitors for the two enzyme classes involved in the hypoxia response.

HIF-regulated hypoxia-inducible genes are involved in angiogenesis, vascularization, and anaerobic energy production, for instance. HIFs are αβ heterodimers in which the stability of the α subunit is regulated in an oxygen-dependent manner (for reviews, see Refs. 1Semenza G.L.

Hydroxylation of at least one of two proline residues, Pro402 and Pro564, in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of human HIF-1α mediates the interaction of HIF-α with the von Hippel Lindau E3 (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) ubiquitin ligase complex that targets it for rapid proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions (5Ivan M.

Under hypoxic conditions, the oxygen-requiring process of hydroxylation is prevented, and HIF-α escapes degradation and dimerizes with HIF-β, the dimer then recognizing a specific element in the promoters of hypoxia-responsive target genes (1Semenza G.L.

Transcriptional activation in an oxygen-dependent manner is another key step that regulates HIF-α activity. Hydroxylation of a specific asparagine residue, Asn803, in the C-terminal transactivation domain of human HIF-1α has recently been shown to block its interaction with the transcriptional coactivator p300 (17Lando D.

The crystal structure of FIH has recently been resolved, and thus detailed information is available on the binding of the peptide substrate and cosubstrates to the enzyme (20Dann III, C.E.

The HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases were recently shown to be very effective oxygen sensors, as their Km values for O2 are slightly above its atmospheric concentration (23Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 2-oxoglutarate analogs were shown to inhibit the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases but with distinctly different Ki values from those of the collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases, whereas differences were also found between the individual HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylase isoenzymes (23Hirsilä M.

In the present study, we expressed human FIH as a recombinant protein in insect cells, examined its requirements for peptide substrates, and determined its kinetic constants for cosubstrates and several 2-oxoglutarate analog inhibitors. Our data indicate distinct differences between FIH and the three human HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases in their Km values for O2 and inhibition by 2-oxoglutarate analogs. Generation of Insect Cell Expression Constructs for Untagged and Tagged FIH—The FIH cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF395830) was obtained by PCR amplification from aorta, colon, and lung Marathon-Ready cDNAs (Clontech) and cloned into pMOS using the pMOSBlue blunt-ended cloning kit (Amersham Biosciences). The full-length FIH cDNA was cloned into the pVL1392, pBlueBacHis (N-terminal His tag), and pAcG3X (N-terminal GST tag) baculovirus expression vectors (Pharmingen). FLAGHis and V5His tags were amplified by PCR from the plasmids d28e6 and d28e5 (FibroGen Inc.), respectively, and cloned into the 3′ end before the stop codon of the FIH cDNA in pVL1392. Expression of Recombinant FIH in Insect Cells and Purification of the Enzyme—The recombinant baculovirus expression vectors were cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells with BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) by calcium phosphate transfection, and the recombinant viruses were amplified (24Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Instruction Manual. PharMingen, San Diego1998Google Scholar). Sf9 or High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured as monolayers in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) or in suspension in Sf900IISFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). To produce recombinant proteins, insect cells seeded at a density of 0.5–1 × 106/ml were infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of 5. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, and centrifuged. The pellets were further solubilized in 1% SDS, and aliquots of both fractions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting with antibodies against the histidine (Amersham Biosciences) or GST (Pharmingen) tags. Recombinant FIH with a C-terminal FLAGHis tag was purified with either an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) or a chelating Sepharose charged with Ni2+ (ProBond, Invitrogen). In FLAG affinity purification, the Triton X-100 extract of insect cells expressing FIH-FLAGHis was passed through the anti-FLAG M2 column several times and allowed to react with the affinity material for 1 h before washing with 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and elution with the same buffer containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The elution buffer was kept in the column for 30 min before fractions of 1.5 ml were collected. In the purification with Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose, the Triton X-100 extract was allowed to react with the Sepharose for 1 h before washing with a 0.3 m NaCl, 0.02 m imidazole, 0.02 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, and elution with a gradient of 0.02–0.5 m imidazole. The fractions collected were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions containing the purified FIH-FLAGHis were pooled, and in the case of the Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose-purified sample, the imidazole was removed by changing the buffer to 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8, using an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device with a Biomax-10 filter (Millipore). Next, the protein concentration was determined (Roti-Quant, Carl Roth). Gel filtration to study the molecular weight of the recombinant FIH-FLAGHis was performed in a calibrated Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Assay of Enzyme Activity—FIH activity was assayed by a modified method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (25Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in a final volume of 0.5 ml, which contained 10–50 μl of the Triton X-100 extracts of the insect cells expressing recombinant untagged or tagged FIH as a source of the enzyme, 100 nmol of the peptide DESGLPQLTSYDCEVNAPIQGSRNLLQGEELLRAL (DES35, Innovagen, the residue corresponding to HIF-1α Asn803 shown in bold) as a substrate, 5 nmol of FeSO4, 50 nmol of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (50,000 dpm), 1 μmol of ascorbate, 30 μg of catalase (Sigma), 0.05 μmol of dithiothreitol, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 25 μmol of Tris-HCl buffer, adjusted to pH 7.8 at 25 °C. The enzyme reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min unless otherwise indicated, the 14CO2 formed being trapped and counted as described (25Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Km values for various peptide substrates (Innovagen), Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, ascorbate, and O2 were determined by varying the concentration of a substrate or co-substrate, whereas the concentrations of the others were kept constant. The Km for O2 was measured as described earlier for the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases (23Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The purified FIH-FLAGHis was used as the source of the enzyme, and the low activity level generated even in the absence of added iron was subtracted from the final values when the Km for Fe2+ was calculated. Ki values were determined by adding the inhibitors at 4–5 constant concentrations, whereas the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate was varied, using cell lysates from insect cells expressing FIH-FLAGHis as the source of enzyme. The catalytic center activity of the purified FIH-FLAGHis was measured under the reaction conditions described above, and the value was subsequently corrected for saturating concentrations of the peptide substrate DES35, Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, and oxygen. Recombinant Expression and Purification of FIH—The recombinant FIH, His-FIH, FIH-FLAGHis, FIH-V5His, and GST-FIH polypeptides were expressed in insect cells, which were harvested 72 h after infection and homogenized in a buffer containing Triton X-100, and the soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting. The FIH, FIH-FLAGHis, and FIH-V5His polypeptides were expressed at approximately equal levels, whereas the expression level of His-FIH was much lower (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 3–10). About half of the recombinant His-FIH (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6) and FIH-FLAGHis (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 7 and 8) polypeptides could be solubilized with the Triton X-100 buffer, whereas the FIH (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4), FIH-V5His, and GST-FIH (Fig. 1, A and B,lanes 9–12) polypeptides were found mostly in the insoluble fraction. Western blot analysis indicated that FIH-V5His was sensitive to degradation (Fig. 1B, lanes 9 and 10), while FIH-FLAGHis and GST-FIH also showed some degradation, especially in the Triton X-100 buffer insoluble fraction (Fig. 1 A and B, lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12). FIH-FLAGHis was selected for purification, and an essentially homogenous protein was obtained by a single-step procedure using either anti-FLAG affinity (Fig. 2, lane 2) or chelating Sepharose (Fig. 2, lane 3) chromatography. Gel filtration experiments in a calibrated column indicated that FIH-FLAGHis is a homodimer (details not shown), this result being in agreement with the structure of the crystallized enzyme (20Dann III, C.E.

Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) was adopted and optimized here to measure the enzyme activity of FIH. The standard substrate used in these measurements was a synthetic 35-amino-acid peptide corresponding to residues 788–822 in the C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1α and containing the Asn803 hydroxylation site, the optimized assay conditions being those given under “Materials and Methods.” The assay was found to be linear with increasing amounts of the Triton-X-100 extracts from insect cells expressing various FIH polypeptide forms (details not shown) or the purified recombinant FIH-FLAGHis polypeptide tested up to 800 nm concentration (Fig. 3A). The assay was also linear with time for at least 20 min (Fig. 3B), and the reaction gave characteristic Michaelis-Menten kinetics when the concentration of the 35-amino-acid peptide substrate (Fig. 4A) or any of the cosubstrates (as shown for 2-oxoglutarate in Fig. 4B) was varied.Fig. 4Determination of Km values for the peptide substrate and 2-oxoglutarate.

The differences in the activity values between the cell extracts do not reflect differences in the specific activities of the various FIH forms but rather differences in the amounts of the recombinant polypeptides present in the soluble fractions (Fig. 1). The catalytic center activity of the purified FIH-FLAGHis (Fig. 2) was calculated from the activity values obtained by correcting them for saturating concentrations of the peptide substrate, Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, and oxygen. The catalytic center activities obtained for the enzyme purified by two alternative procedures were 85–135 and 70–120 mol/mol/min, respectively (Table II), the highest values probably being closest to the true activity, as the enzyme tended to become partially inactivated during purification (details not shown). These values are more than 1 order of magnitude higher than those reported for recombinant FIH produced in Escherichia coli (18Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.-M. Bullock A.N.

This difference may be in part due to differences in the assay conditions used but may also be due to higher catalytic center activity in the recombinant enzyme expressed in insect cells than in that expressed in E. coli. It may be noted that for the three human HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases, expression in insect cells gave markedly higher enzyme activity levels than expression in E. coli (23Hirsilä M. Koivunen P.

https://openalex.org/W1970378023,"The p53 protein integrates multiple upstream signals and functions as a tumor suppressor by activating distinct downstream genes1,2,3. At the cellular level, p53 induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence. A rare mutant form of p53 with the amino acid substitution R175P, found in human tumors, is completely defective in initiating apoptosis but still induces cell cycle arrest4,5. To decipher the functional importance of these pathways in spontaneous tumorigenesis, we used homologous recombination to generate mice with mutant p53-R172P (the mouse equivalent of R175P in humans). Mice inheriting two copies of this mutation (Trp53515C/515C) escape the early onset of thymic lymphomas that characterize Trp53-null mice. At 7 months of age, 90% of Trp53-null mice had died, but 85% of Trp53515C/515C mice were alive and tumor-free, indicating that p53-dependent apoptosis was not required for suppression of early onset of spontaneous tumors. The lymphomas and sarcomas that eventually developed in Trp53515C/515C mice retained a diploid chromosome number, in sharp contrast to aneuploidy observed in tumors and cells from Trp53-null mice. The ability of mutant p53-R172P to induce a partial cell cycle arrest and retain chromosome stability are crucial for suppression of early onset tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018042402,"The biliary system, pancreas and liver all develop from the nearby foregut at almost the same time in mammals. The molecular mechanisms that determine the identity of each organ in this complex area are unknown. Hes1 encodes the basic helix-loop-helix protein Hes1 (ref. 1), which represses positive basic helix-loop-helix genes such as Neurog3 (ref. 3). Expression of Hes1 is controlled by the evolutionarily conserved Notch pathway. Hes1 operates as a general negative regulator of endodermal endocrine differentiation, and defects in Notch signaling lead to accelerated pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Mutations in JAG1, encoding a Notch ligand, cause the Alagille syndrome in humans, characterized by poor development of the biliary system, suggesting that the Notch pathway is also involved in normal biliary development. Here we show that Hes1 is expressed in the extrahepatic biliary epithelium throughout development and that Hes1-deficient mice have gallbladder agenesis and severe hypoplasia of extrahepatic bile ducts. Biliary epithelium in Hes1-/- mice ectopically expresses the proendocrine gene Neurog3 (refs. 12,13), differentiates into endocrine and exocrine cells and forms acini and islet-like structures in the mutant bile ducts. Thus, biliary epithelium has the potential for pancreatic differentiation and Hes1 determines biliary organogenesis by preventing the pancreatic differentiation program, probably by directly repressing transcription of Neurog3."
https://openalex.org/W1963957340,"We here describe a new molecularly engineered green fluorescent protein chimera that shows a high sensitivity to pH in the alkaline range. This probe was named mtAlpHi, for mitochondrial alkaline pH indicator, and possesses several key properties that render it optimal for studying the dynamics of mitochondrial matrix pH, e.g. it has an apparent pKa (pKa′) around 8.5, it shows reversible and large changes in fluorescence in response to changes in pH (both in vitro and in intact cells), and it is selectively targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Using mtAlpHi we could monitor pH changes that occur in the mitochondrial matrix in a variety of situations, e.g. treatment with uncouplers or Ca2+ ionophores, addition of drugs that interfere with ATP synthesis or electron flow in the respiratory chain, weak bases or acids, and receptor activation. We observed heterogeneous pH increases in the mitochondrial matrix during Ca2+ accumulation by this organelle.

In recent years, mitochondria have been the focus of renewed attention by cell biologists. Not only are they pivotal in cell energy metabolism, but they are also involved in other phenomena of key importance, primarily in the control of Ca2+ homeostasis and in apoptosis. For example, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can modulate the kinetics of cytosolic Ca2+ changes, and in turn, mitochondrial metabolism is directly controlled by Ca2+ uptake, since an elevation of mitochondrial [Ca2+]m 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]m, mitochondrial matrix, free Ca2+ concentration; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mtAlpHi, mitochondrial alkaline pH indicator; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; mtECFP, mitochondrial enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; mtEYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; TPEN, tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethylethyl); TBHQ, 2,5-di-tertbutylhydrochinone; KRB, Krebs-Ringer buffer; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ehtane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester; SERCA, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. activates three key mitochondrial dehydrogenases, thereby increasing NAD(P)H production, electron transport, H+ extrusion, and ATP synthesis.

While ΔΨ can now be monitored in situ with probes that show high specificity and sensitivity, the methodologies for measuring the pH of the mitochondrial matrix are less evolved. Matrix pH can be monitored in intact cells with pH indicators such as fluorescein, carboxy-SNARF and BCECF, preferentially trapped within mitochondria by manipulating the experimental conditions, e.g. temperature, loading, and post-loading incubation times, and dye concentration (6Weinlich M.

We here describe the construction and characterization of a new GFP based pH indicator with a pKa′ in the alkaline region (i.e. with an ideal sensitivity to monitor pH variations within the mitochondrial matrix), which we named mtAlpHi, for mitochondrial alkaline pH indicator. This probe possesses several properties essential for studying the dynamics of mitochondrial matrix pH; it responds rapidly and reversibly to changes in pH (both in vitro and in intact cells), it has an apparent pKa (pKa′) around 8.5, it is selectively targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, and it lacks toxicity or evident interference with normal cellular functions. Using this novel probe, the dynamics of mitochondrial pH were monitored in situ under different experimental conditions, and new information concerning this key parameter was obtained. Generation of Constructs—The new pH indicator described in this paper derives from the EYFP based on insertion in the Ca2+ indicator camgaroo2 (Ref. 21Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar; kindly provided by R. Y. Tsien), with the substitution of calmodulin by a portion of aequorin. The chosen part of aequorin spans bp 334 to 553 of the wild type cDNA and contains two of three active EF-hands of aequorin; the final construct, mtAlpHi, is mitochondrially targeted. For prokaryotic expression, the mitochondrial targeting sequence was removed and the remaining coding region was transferred to pRSET-B (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy); the expressed recombinant protein possesses an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. Details of all constructs are available upon request. Protein Expression and in Vitro pH Sensitivity—For in vitro analyses, the recombinant protein with a polyhistidine tag was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen). Bacteria were lysed by sonication, cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the soluble protein was purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using a nickel-coated resin (Ni-NTA Spin Kit; Qiagen, Milan, Italy). Protein was quantified by the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin as standard. A PerkinElmer Life Science LS55B fluorescence spectrometer was used to determine the excitation and emission spectra of the purified protein (0.3 mg/ml in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8), as well as the dependence of its fluorescence intensity on calcium and pH; the fluorescence sensitivity to [Ca2+] was tested from 10-9 to 10-2m, whereas the pH was varied from 7.0 to 11.0. Mammalian Cell Expression—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For transient expression, cells were seeded onto 24-mm diameter round glass coverslips and transfections were performed at 50–70% confluence with the calcium phosphate method, using a total of 8 μg of DNA; for co-transfections, the ratio between the two constructs was 50:50. Cortical Neuronal Culture—Mixed cultures of astrocytes and neurons were obtained from rat neonatal cortices as described previously (22Pasti L. Pozzan T. Carmignoto G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15203-15210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Modifications were introduced to optimize neuronal survival as described in Ref. 23Burgo A. Carmignoto G. Pizzo P. Pozzan T. Fasolato C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 537-552Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar. For transient expression, cortical neurons were seeded onto 24-mm diameter round glass coverslips, and transfections were performed with the LipofectAMINE 2000 method (Invitrogen), using a total of 1.6 μg of DNA; for co-transfections, the ratio between the two constructs was 1/1. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells expressing the fluorescent probes were observed 48 h after transfection on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan), a Fluar® oil immersion objective (40×, N.A. 1.30) was used. Excitation light at appropriate wavelengths was produced by a monochromator (Polychrome II, TILL Photonics, Martinsried, Germany): 425 nm for mtECFP, 480 nm for mtAlpHi, and 510 nm for mtEYFP. For cells loaded with fura-2, excitation was at 340 and 380 nm; emitted light was collected through a FT425 dichroic beamsplitter and a 480EFLP emission filter. For cells co-transfected with mtAlpHi and mtECFP, a 505DRLP dichroic beamsplitter was used, and emitted light was collected through a 535RDF45 emission filter. For cells co-transfected with mtEYFP and mtECFP cells, a JP4 BS dichroic beam-splitter was used, and emitted light was collected through a 51017M + 10 (CFP/YFP dual) emission filter. Unless otherwise stated, filters and dichroic beamsplitters were purchased from Omega Optical and Chroma Technologies (Brattleboro, VT). Images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera (Imago, TILL Photonics) attached to a 12-bit frame rabber. Synchronization of the monochromator and CCD camera was performed through a control unit run by TILLvisION v.4.0 (TILL Photonics); this software was also used for image analysis. Calcium Measurements with fura-2—HeLa cells were loaded with the cell permeant probe fura-2 AM (2 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, in a Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB; containing, in mm, 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 Na3PO4, 1 MgS04, 1 CaCl2, 5.5 glucose, 20 Hepes, pH 7.4 at 37 °C). Cells were washed and incubated in KRB for another 20 min at room temperature, to complete desterification, before measurements were started. Aequorin Measurements—Cells transiently expressing aequorin were reconstituted in KRB, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 μm coelenterazine for 1 h. The cells were transfected with either the cDNA encoding mtaequorin or co-transfected with mtaequorin and mtAlpHi. During the experimental procedure, cells were placed in a temperature-controlled chamber, at 37 °C, and perfused with KRB. Photons emitted were collected and analyzed as described previously (24Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Cell Stimulations—For in situ calibration experiments, HeLa cells were perfused with modified KRB (containing, in mm, 5 NaCl, 125 KCl, 1 Na3PO4, 1 MgS04, 10 Hepes for pH 6–7.5, in 0.5 steps; for pH values 8 and above, Hepes was substituted by Tris). All calibration experiments were carried out in the presence of nigericin and monensin (5 μm each). KRB was used for experiments with sodium acetate and NH4Cl (30 mm in each case); in parallel, [NaCl] was brought down to 95 mm. Permeabilization of HeLa cells was carried out by incubating in KRB-3 (containing, in mm, 10 NaCl, 130 KCl, 1 Na3PO4, 5 succinate, 1 ATP, 1 EGTA, 10 Tris, pH 8.0), supplemented with digitonin (100 μm). After permeabilization, cells were maintained in KRB-3 with or without MgCl2. Cortical neurons were perfused with standard solutions as described in Ref. 23Burgo A. Carmignoto G. Pizzo P. Pozzan T. Fasolato C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 537-552Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar. Perfusion with histamine (100 μm) was employed to trigger Ca2+ release from intracellular stores; perfusion with 2,5-di-tert-butyl-hydrochinone, (TBHQ, 30 μm) was employed to inhibit endoplasmatic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; ionomycin was employed at 1 μm and FCCP at 4 μm. Unless otherwise indicated, all experimental procedures were carried out at room temperature. Coelenterazine, fura-2, BAPTA-AM and tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethylethyl)enediamine (TPEN) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands); ionomycin was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other materials were of analytical or highest available grade and acquired from Sigma (Milan, Italy). All typical experiments presented are representative of at least three trials with very similar results. Numerical data are presented as mean ± S.D. Construction and Properties of mtAlpHi, a New, GFP-based, pH Indicator—The fluorescence of wild type GFP is notoriously resistant to variations in ambient parameters, including pH, ionic strength, as well as cation and anion concentration. Conversely, most GFP mutants are sensitive to changes in the surrounding milieu, in particular pH. During the characterization of some Ca2+-sensitive GFP mutants, we observed that insertional mutants of YFP, the so called “camgaroos,” are, unlike YFP itself, quite sensitive to pH changes above 8. 2M.

We thus undertook the design of a pH indicator suited for measurements within the mitochondrial matrix. As described under “Materials and Methods,” we replaced the insertion of camgaroo (calmodulin) with a similar sized peptide. The new insertion molecule is a deleted version of aequorin, comprising 73 amino acids containing the second and the third EF-hand domains, thus lacking the first EF-hand, elimination of this part of aequorin was deemed suitable, since it practically abolishes the Ca2+-dependent luminescence of aequorin. 2M. F. Cano Abad, G. Di Benedetto, P. J. Magalhães, L. Filippin, and T. Pozzan, unpublished observations. Targeting to the mitochondrial matrix was achieved in the same way as in camgaroo (21Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The pH and Ca2+ sensitivity of the purified chimeric molecule were tested in vitro. Excitation and emission spectra at different pH values are shown in Fig. 1 and are similar to those of the original citrine (21Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity increased as pH was raised from 7.0 to 10.5, after which the trend was reversed, most likely due to the denaturation of the protein under these extreme conditions. Plotting normalized peak fluorescence intensities (excitation 498 nm, emission 522 nm) against pH reveals an apparent pKa′ of 8.5 (Fig. 1, inset), in a medium mimicking intracellular cation concentration. The Ca2+ sensitivity was also tested and no variation in fluorescence was observed for changes in [Ca2+] from 10-9 to 10-2m (data not shown). mtAlpHi as an in Situ Mitochondrial pH Indicator—HeLa cells transiently expressing mtAlpHi show a typical mitochondrial pattern (Fig. 2A). To confirm the mitochondrial localization of mtAlpHi, we co-transfected cells with a cyan mutant of GFP targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (mtECFP; Fig. 2B); as seen in Fig. 2C, the two probes show a perfect colocalization. The effect of a classical protonophore, FCCP, on the fluorescence of mtAlpHi is shown in Fig. 3A. As expected, FCCP induced a rapid drop in fluorescence that reached a new steady state within 1–2 min; the rate of the drop depends on the dose of the uncoupler (data not shown). It should be noted that, as shown in Fig. 1, the pH changes result only in changes of the fluorescent intensity of mtAlpHi but not in a spectral shift. Given the different expression levels in different cells and, especially, the continuous changes in mitochondrial shape and position, quantitative measurements with a single, non-ratiometric indicator are prone to artifacts and often difficult to interpret correctly. To bypass this problem, mtAlpHi was co-transfected with mtECFP. The choice of ECFP as a partner for mtAlpHi resides in the fact that both molecules can be imaged simultaneously, being distinguishable in both excitation and emission spectra. In addition, among GFP mutants, ECFP is one of the most stable with respect to pH changes (9Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The use of two probes loaded in the same compartment has been introduced in the past to bypass the problem of non-ratiometric Ca2+ indicators, and although not devoid of problems, it is a simple way to correct for movement artifacts, change of focus, etc. For a detailed discussion of this point see Refs. 9Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar and 25Rudolf R. Mongillo M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar. The effect of an uncoupler on the fluorescence of mtAlpHi and mtECFP co-expressed in the same cell is shown in Fig. 3B. Upon addition of FCCP, the fluorescence of mtECFP was practically unaffected, while that of mtAlpHi dropped, as shown before. The fluorescence ratio mtAlpHi/mtECFP is presented in Fig. 3C. The experiment presented in Fig. 3, D and E, shows an additional characteristic of the fluorescence of mtAlpHi, also found in the YFP from which it derives. Immediately upon illumination, the fluorescence of mtAlpHi drops rapidly, without any added stimulus, until the initial fluorescence is reduced by about 40%; afterward, the fluorescence intensity is characterized by a slowly declining plateau. This initial drop in fluorescence is most likely due to photoisomerization, given that the signal recovers to almost the initial value if the exciting beam is switched off for a few tens of seconds. Brief periods of non-illumination, e.g. 5–10 s, were sufficient to promote only a partial recovery (Fig. 3D). The declining plateau, on the other hand, is due to photobleaching, in as much as it does not recover after a period of non-illumination. The fluorescence of mtECFP, on the contrary, shows a marginal rapid drop upon start of illumination. The rates of photobleaching are similar for both mtAlpHi and mtECFP. The fluorescence ratio reflects these characteristics, dropping initially and then it is practically constant (Fig. 3E). For the pH calibration of mtAlpHi fluorescence in situ, HeLa cells co-expressing mtAlpHi and mtECFP were perfused with high K+ solutions at different pH values, in the presence of nigericin and monensin (to equilibrate extra- and intracellular pH). The increase in pH resulted in a substantial increase in the fluorescence of mtAlpHi, while the signal of mtECFP remained practically unaltered, giving rise to the steep ratio change shown in Fig. 4A. For comparison, control cells coexpressing mtEYFP and mtECFP were subjected to the same experimental protocol, yielding a much flatter ratio (Fig. 4B). The dynamic range of mtAlpHi fluorescence is markedly different from that of mtEYFP: whereas the former increases ∼3-fold between pH 7 and 8.5, the latter shows a much smaller change (<15%). With this calibration, we calculate the mitochondrial matrix pH in intact cells in steady state conditions to be 8.05 ± 0.11; upon addition of FCCP this value drops to about 7.50 ± 0.22. Finally, two other compounds known to alter mitochondrial pH were applied to cells co-expressing mtAlpHi and mtECFP, i.e. sodium acetate and NH4Cl. As expected, addition of sodium acetate caused a net decrease in mitochondrial pH; conversely, addition of NH4Cl induced an increase in pH; the steady state pH was reached again after washout (Fig. 5A). Additional experiments were carried out to verify the sensitivity of the system to drugs that interfere with ATP synthesis (olygomycin) or the electron flow in the respiratory chain. The block of the ATPase with oligomycin resulted in a modest pH increase, while further addition of cyanide caused a slow but larger drop of pH, as predicted. In parallel we also measured ΔΨ with the potential sensitive dye TMRM; a small increase was observed upon addition of oligomycin, while a slow collapse of ΔΨ occurred upon further addition of KCN (data not shown). Although GFP is considered rather inert in terms of cell physiology, the possibility that the construct may interfere with cellular functions must be taken into consideration. In particular, since mtAlpHi contains two EF-hand (Ca2+-binding domains), its effect on Ca2+ handling in the cytosol and mitochondria was tested. To determine cytosolic variations in [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c), cells expressing mtAlpHi were loaded with the ratiometric calcium indicator fura-2 and challenged both with histamine and 2,5-di-tert-butylhydrochinone (TBHQ), two well characterized agents that raise [Ca2+]c. The changes in fura-2 signal were monitored, and although there was some variability in the response among individual cells, there was practically no difference between control and mtAlpHi expressing cells (Fig. 6). To verify that mitochondrial Ca2+ handling is also unaffected by expression of mtAlpHi, cells were co-transfected with the pH indicator and with aequorin targeted to mitochondria (mtaequorin; Ref. 26Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, mitochondrial Ca2+ handling is unaffected by the expression of mtAlpHi.Fig. 7Normal mitochondrial Ca2+ handling by HeLa cells expressing mtAlpHi. HeLa cells were co-transfected with mtAlpHi and mtAequorin and challenged with histamine (100 μm); as controls, HeLa cells expressing mtAequorin alone were challenged in the same way. The traces show a similar response in both cases. In the inset, it can be seen that the peak amplitude of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is the same in both conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mitochondrial pH Changes in Response to Ca2+ Mobilizing Agents—The uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria is linked to the extrusion of H+ from the matrix. In isolated mitochondria, Ca2+ uptake is known to cause a drastic pH alkalinization if no permeant anions are present in the medium (for a recent review, see Ref. 27Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). The effect of Ca2+ uptake in mitochondria of intact cells was thus tested. HeLa cells co-transfected with mtAlpHi and mtECFP were challenged with histamine and the pH response monitored. We found that only ∼14% (25/184) of the cells analyzed responded to histamine and in this case with a small and reversible pH increment (Fig. 8A, black trace); the vast majority of cells did not show any variation in fluorescence (Fig. 8A, gray trace). Other protocols to induce more prolonged Ca2+ increases in the mitochondria were also tested, e.g. the application of TBHQ in Ca2+-free medium, followed by readdition of Ca2+; no significant changes in pH were observed under these conditions (data not shown). To verify whether pH changes within the matrix occur under conditions more relevant for physiology or pathology, experiments were carried out in primary cultures of cortical neurons treated with the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Upon treatment with glutamate, a rapid substantial alkalinization was observed in three out eight neurones analyzed. A typical example of the kinetics of this pH change in a single neuron is presented Fig. 8B. A common protocol to cause the release of Ca2+ from internal stores is that of adding a Ca2+ ionophore, such as ionomycin or A23187, to c"

This suggests that EGFR-inhibitory agents may be of therapeutic value. In the present study, we investigated the effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a bioactive green tea polyphenol, on EGFR signaling in cervical cells. EGCG inhibits epidermal growth factor-dependent activation of EGFR, and EGFR-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. EGCG also inhibits EGFR-dependent AKT activity. The EGCG-dependent reduction in ERK and AKT activity is associated with reduced phosphorylation of downstream substrates, including p90RSK, FKHR, and BAD. These changes are associated with increased p53, p21WAF-1, and p27KIP-1 levels, reduced cyclin E level, and reduced CDK2 kinase activity. Consistent with these findings, flow cytometry and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) staining revealed EGCG-dependent G1 arrest. Moreover, sustained EGCG treatment caused apoptotic cell death. In addition to inhibiting EGFR, cell-free studies demonstrated that EGCG directly inhibits ERK1/2 and AKT, suggesting that EGCG acts simultaneously at multiple levels to inhibit EGF-dependent signaling. Importantly, the EGCG inhibition is selective, as EGCG does not effect the EGFR-dependent activation of JNK.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F55-F78PubMed Google Scholar). High risk HPV subtypes immortalize cervical epithelial cells via the action of two oncogenes, E6 and E7, that enhance cell proliferation by abrogating apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoint function (2Howley P.M. Munger K. Romanczuk H. Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1991; 22: 239-248PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, HPV-immortalized cells acquire increased mitogenic potential and the ability to resist differentiation and apoptosis (3Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A.

For this reason, interfering with EGFR function is a focus of anti-cervical cancer therapy. Efforts to inhibit EGFR have focused on decreasing its level and/or activity (14Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). In addition, downstream EGFR targets, including ERK1/2 and protein kinase B (PKB, also referred to as AKT), are considered viable drug targets. Because cervical disease develops slowly and requires multiple events, the use of dietary chemopreventive agents is an important option for treatment of this disease, which is supported by epidemiologic studies suggesting that modifying the diet can reduce cervical cancer risk (15Murthy N.S. Mathew A. Eur. J. Cancer Prev. 2000; 9: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Polyphenols derived from green tea solids are effective chemopreventive agents.

In addition, it has been shown to increase p27KIP-1 levels, inhibit cyclin activity, and inhibit cell cycle progression (21Liang Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Chen C.F. Lin J.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 22Ahmad N. Cheng P. Mukhtar H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the ability of EGCG to inhibit EGF-dependent EGFR signaling and downstream MAPK activation. Our studies show that EGCG inhibits EGFR function. Remarkably, this leads to highly specific downstream effects, as only selected downstream EGFR-responsive kinases are reduced in activity. This inhibition ultimately leads to growth cessation and cell apoptosis. Moreover, in vitro cell-free studies suggest that EGCG may directly inhibit selected downstream kinases. These studies provide novel new insights into the intracellular mechanism of green tea polyphenol action and suggest that EGCG may be an effective chemopreventive agent for cervical cancer. Cell Culture and Cell Proliferation Assay—Immortalized cervical cells (ECE16-1) and cervical tumor cells (HeLa, Caski, and SiHa) were maintained in complete medium. For experiments, the cells were treated in a defined medium (DM) composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 (3:1) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, non-essential amino acids, l-glutamine, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 1 nm triiodothyronine, 0.18 nm adenine, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 20 ng/ml EGF, and antibiotics. EGCG was dissolved in sterile water at 50 mm and stored at 4 °C. For proliferation experiments, cells were plated in 24-well plates at 10,000 cells/well in complete medium. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were equilibrated in defined medium and treated with EGCG-containing medium on alternate days. For counting, the cells were harvested from triplicate wells with trypsin and counted using a Coulter counter. Reagents—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F-12 medium, medium supplements, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate and anti-β-actin were from Sigma. Histone H1 and pRB was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-activated EGFR antibody (E12120) was obtained from Translab, anti-phosho-ERK1/2 (K-23), anti-ERK1/2 (E-4), anti-CDK2 (M-2), anti-CDK4 (H-22), anti-CDK6 (H-230), anti-cyclin E (M-20), and anti-EGFR (1005) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Anti-cyclin D1, anti-p53, and anti-pRB were from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-PARP, anti-p21WAF-1, anti-p27KIP-1, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Thymidine Incorporation—Cells were grown for 24 h in defined medium containing various concentrations of EGCG and then shifted to defined medium containing 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (61 Ci/mmol)/ml for 2 h. The cells were thoroughly washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by a single wash with 5% trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in 2 n NaOH, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Cell Cycle Analysis—EGCG-treated cells were harvested, fixed with methanol, washed, treated with RNase A, and stained for DNA with propidium iodide as described previously (23Rorke E.A. Zhang D. Choo C.K. Eckert R.L. Jacobberger J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The fraction of cells present in each cell cycle phase (G0/G1, S, G2 + M), as well as apoptotic cells, was determined by mathematical modeling of DNA histograms representing 10,000 events or more. The modeling software was Modfit from Verity House (Topsham, ME). The model components were based on normal distributions for Go/G1 and G2 + M and a single broadened trapezoid for S-phase as described previously (23Rorke E.A. Zhang D. Choo C.K. Eckert R.L. Jacobberger J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Jacobberger J.W. Sizemore N. Gorodeski G. Rorke E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Assay—Cells were seeded in growth medium at 1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish, allowed to attach overnight, and then treated with 5–50 μm EGCG in DM for 0–48 h. Cells were harvested with trypsin, washed once, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. To detect annexin V, cells were incubated with annexin V-FITC for 20 min at 37 °C and then washed to remove unbound annexin. Propidium iodide was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min. The labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells that showed FITC staining were designated as apoptotic, whereas the double stained cells were designated as post-apoptotic. TUNEL Assay—A TUNEL assay was performed using ApopTag (Intergen, Purchase, NY). Cells were seeded at 1–4 × 104 cells/well in 12-well cluster dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were switched to DM for 24 h and then treated with EGCG for 0–48 h. The cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with pre-chilled (-20 °C) ethanol:acetic acid (2:1 v/v). After further washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated in DNA labeling solution (enzymatic incorporation of FITC-UTP into stand breaks) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed with stop/wash buffer. The cells were then mounted in Anti-Fade® (Molecular Probes) and examined with a fluorescence microscope. Immunoblot—Total cells extracts were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer and electrophoresed at 10,000 cell equivalents/lane on denaturing acrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with primary antibody. Binding of the primary antibody was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate (West Pico, Pierce). Densitometric analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad FluorS. Kinase Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, bestatin, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and E64. Following lysis, protein was estimated using a modified Folin-Lowry protocol (Bio-Rad), and 250 μg of protein lysate was used per kinase reaction. One microgram of primary antibody was added to each sample followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G beads were added, and samples were rotated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer followed by two washes with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCI2, 2.5 mm EGTA, I mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF). Cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity was measured by the incorporation of [32 P]ATP into protein substrate. The immunoprecipitated kinase bound to the A/G beads are incubated in kinase buffer supplemented with 20 pm ATP, 1 μg of protein substrate, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and exposure to film. MAPK and ATK activities were measured in nonradioactive kinase assays using kits purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Washed beads from the immunoprecipitation were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 pm ATP and 1 μg of protein substrate, and the extent of phosphorylation of substrate was determined using the appropriate phospho-specific antibody followed by chemiluminescent detection. EGCG Inhibits EGFR Activation—EGFR activity is required for growth of ECE16-1 cells (12Sah J.F. Eckert R.L. Chandraratna R.A. Rorke E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9728-9735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether EGCG effects EGFR function, ECE16-1 cells were cultured overnight in the absence of EGF stimulation. The cells were then treated with 0–50 μm EGCG for 30 min followed by 5 ng/ml EGF for 10 min. The upper panel in Fig. 1 shows a marked activation of EGFR (P-EGFR) in EGF-treated cells. EGCG treatment results in a concentration-dependent reduction in this activity. Activity is reduced by 65% in cells treated with 50 μm EGCG. Total EGFR level is not affected by EGCG treatment (Fig. 1). EGCG Suppresses EGFR-dependent Activation of ERK1/2, and AKT—We next evaluated whether the EGCG-dependent reduction in EGFR activity is associated with reduced down-stream kinase activity. ECE16-1 cells display a characteristic EGF-dependent activation of ERK, JNK, p38, and AKT (12Sah J.F. Eckert R.L. Chandraratna R.A. Rorke E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9728-9735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Treatment with 50 μm EGCG reduced EGF-dependent ERK1/2 activity by 83% and AKT activity by 50% (Fig. 2). In contrast, EGCG does not reduce P-JNK1/2 level (not shown), and EGCG produces a slight increase in p38 activity. The selective inhibition of ERK1/2 and AKT activity is noteworthy because these kinases regulate cell proliferation and survival (25Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 26Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3467) Google Scholar, 27Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). The activation of p38 is also important given its role in cell differentiation (28Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Neither EGF nor EGCG treatment altered the absolute level of ERK, p38, or AKT (Fig. 2). EGF-dependent activation of EGFR results in the biphasic activation of ERK in ECE16-1 cells with peak activity at 10 min and 24 h (12Sah J.F. Eckert R.L. Chandraratna R.A. Rorke E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9728-9735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). EGCG inhibited both peaks of ERK activation (not shown). EGCG Directly Inhibits ERK1/2 and AKT Activity—We next examined whether downstream kinases are directly effected by EGCG. Extracts were prepared from EGF-stimulated cells and various downstream kinases were collected by immunoprecipitation. The precipitated kinases were then incubated in in vitro kinase reactions in the presence of 0–50 μm EGCG. As shown in Fig. 3, low concentrations of EGCG (5 μm) caused a substantial reduction in AKT and ERK1/2 activity. Higher EGCG concentrations inhibit p38 MAPK. In contrast, JNK1/2 activity was not altered. EGCG Inhibits Protein Phosphorylation Downstream of AKT—AKT targets the forkhead transcription factor, FKHR, the BCL-2 family member BAD, and GSK3α/β. As seen in Fig. 4A, treating cells with EGCG caused reduced FKHR and BAD phosphorylation. In contrast, GSK3α/β phosphorylation was not significantly altered. Phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK downstream target, ATF-2, was enhanced at intermediate EGCG concentrations (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of ELK, the ERK1/2 target, was slightly reduced. However, the activity of the ERK target, p90RSK, was markedly inhibited by EGCG (Fig. 4C). These findings indicate that EGCG selectively inhibits phosphorylation of specific substrates. EGCG Treatment Inhibits Cell Proliferation—Reduced MAPK and PKB/Akt activity is frequently associated with reduced cell numbers (29Liebmann C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Golubovskaya V. Beviglia L. Xu L.H. Earp H.S. Craven R. Cance W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38978-38987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine whether EGCG would suppress cell growth or increase cell death. As shown in Fig. 5A, EGCG produced a concentration-dependent reduction in ECE16-1 cell number that was detected as early as 36 h after initiation of treatment. To assess the reversibility of the EGCG-dependent response, cells were treated with or without 50 μm EGCG. After a 48-h treatment, the cells were transferred to EGCG-free medium, and cell growth was continued. As shown in Fig. 5B, the removal of EGCG restores cell proliferation to a rate similar to that observed in untreated cultures. A similar pattern of recovery was observed for HeLa cells (not shown). DNA synthesis was monitored as a second index of cell proliferation. ECE16-1 cells were treated for 24 h with EGCG and then pulsed with [3H]thymidine prior to harvest. As seen in Fig 5C, EGCG treatment produces a concentration-dependent decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation. To determine whether these effects can be generalized to other cervical cell lines, we treated HeLa, CaSki, and SiHa cells with EGCG. As shown in Fig. 5D, all lines were inhibited by EGCG treatment. EGCG Treatment Increases Cell Death—Reduced cell numbers could be the result of diminished cell proliferation or increased cell death. As an initial approach to identifying the mechanism of cell death, we treated ECE16-1 cells with EGCG and then analyzed them by flow cytometry. Fig. 6 shows that EGCG treatment for 24 h causes accumulation of cells in G1 and treatment for 48 and 72 h causes accumulation of sub-G1 cells. This accumulation of sub-G1 cells is associated with increased accumulation of surface annexin (Fig. 7). Untreated ECE16-1 cells are propidium iodide-positive (4–8%), annexin-positive (1–3%), or positive for both (4–10%). Treatment with concentrations of EGCG ≤ 10 μm does not alter this distribution. In contrast, treatment with 30 and 50 μm EGCG results in a marked increase in annexin- and propidium iodide-positive cells, indicating an increase in advanced stage apoptosis (Fig. 7, C and D). EGCG-dependent induction of annexin binding was also observed in HeLa and SiHa cells (Fig. 7E).Fig. 7EGCG-dependent increase in phosphatidylserine level in the outer plasma membrane leaflet. A–D, phosphatidylserine levels were detected by annexin V-FITC binding. ECE16-1 cells, treated with 0–50 μm EGCG for 48 h and stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Cells that are annexin-positive and propidium iodide-negative (upper left corner of lower right quadrant) are representative of early apoptotic cells. Cells strongly positive for both annexin and propidium iodide (above the diagonal axis of the upper right quadrant) are late apoptotic/necrotic cells. E, summary of dot-plot results for five independent experiments expressed as percent annexin-positive cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We used a TUNEL assay as a third method of evaluating apoptosis. Staining ECE16-1 cells following EGCG treatment revealed numerous TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 8A). In contrast, untreated ECE16-1 cells were not stained. In addition, treatment of ECE16-1 cells with EGCG resulted in enhanced levels of cleaved (89 kDa) PARP. TUNEL-positive cells were also observed in EGCG-treated CaSki, HeLa, and SiHa cells (Fig. 8B). EGCG Perturbs Cell Cycle Regulators—As shown in Fig. 9B, EGCG increases p53 but not pRB level. The increase in p53 protein expression was associated with an increased p21WAF-1 level and diminished cyclin E level (Fig. 9A). The p27 level was also increased, but CDK2, CDK4, and cyclin D1 levels did not change (Fig. 9A). We also measured CDK activity. As shown in Fig. 10, EGCG treatment reduced the CDK2 kinase activity as measured by the ability to phosphorylate H1 histone. In contrast, CDK4 and CDK6 activity were not changed.Fig. 10EGCG inhibits CDK2 activity. ECE16-1 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and allowed to reach 60–70% confluence, at which time they were treated with various concentrations of EGCG for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and the indicated kinases (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6) were immunoprecipitated (IP) (500 μg of protein equivalents of lysate/reaction) and used in kinase assays with the appropriate protein substrate and ATP. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ECE16-1 cells are immortalized cervical cells, which mimic human disease in that they over-express EGFR, grow at a fast rate, and have lost the ability to terminally differentiate. We have previously shown that proliferation of these cells requires EGF (13Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar) and that proliferation is inhibited by blocking EGFR signaling or reducing EGFR level (12Sah J.F. Eckert R.L. Chandraratna R.A. Rorke E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9728-9735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar). Our present studies show that EGCG inhibits EGF-mediated EGFR activation. This inhibition is associated with reduced activation of ERK1/2 and AKT. The inhibition of EGFR, AKT, and ERK1/2 is significant, as these kinases play a key role in cervical cancer cell proliferation (6Ngan H.Y. Cheung A.N. Liu S.S. Cheng D.K. Ng T.Y. Wong L.C. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Page C. Huang M. Jin X. Cho K. Lilja J. Reynolds R.K. Lin J. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 23-28PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ma Y.Y.

Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cell-free experiments demonstrate that EGCG can directly inhibit AKT and ERK1/2 activity. Thus, EGCG may inhibit cell proliferation by direct interaction with kinases at multiple levels in the signaling cascade. This suggestion is consistent with recent reports in other systems (34Liang Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Chen C.F. Lin J.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 35Masuda M. Suzui M. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4220-4229PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pianetti S. Guo S. Kavanagh K.T. Sonenshein G.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 652-655PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting feature of this regulation is the selectivity. ERK1/2, p38, JNK1/2, and AKT/PKB are all known targets of EGFR (29Liebmann C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 37Danielsen A.J. Maihle N.J. Growth Factors. 2002; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, only ERK1/2 and AKT/PKB activity is inhibited by EGCG in vivo. In contrast, p38 is slightly activated, and JNK1/2 activity does not change. In particular, phosphorylation of several kinases and downstream targets in the EGFR and AKT/PKB pathways is strongly suppressed by EGCG treatment. These targets include EGFR, AKT/PKB, FKHR, and BAD. However, the in vivo activity of another kinase in this cascade, GSK3α/β, is not affected. This selectivity is likely to be important, as FKHR and BAD regulate apoptosis. Dephosphorylated FKHR translocates to the nucleus and increases expression of BIM and FAS ligand (both proapoptotic regulators (38Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar)), whereas dephosphorylated BAD sequesters and inactivates the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL (39Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar). These results suggest that EGCG treatment predisposes the cells to apoptosis. Recent reports also demonstrate that AKT influences p53 level by altering nuclear mdm2 expression (40Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 41Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 462-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Moreover AKT also decreases the p27 level (42Shin I. Yakes F.M. Rojo F. Shin N.Y. Bakin A.V. Baselga J. Arteaga C.L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 43Liang J. Zubovitz J. Petrocelli T. Kotchetkov R. Connor M.K. Han K. Lee J.H. Ciarallo S. Catzavelos C.

Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). These findings predict that inhibiting AKT activity should increase p53 and p27 levels. Indeed, our results indicate that EGCG treatment produces increased p53 and p27. Increased p53 and p27 levels are associated with the G1 arrest observed when EGFR expression is inhibited (39Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar, 46Busse D. Doughty R.S. Ramsey T.T. Russell W.E. Price J.O. Flanagan W.M. Shawver L.K. Arteaga C.L. J.

Cancer Lett. 2001; 169: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). On balance, these findings suggest a pathway in which EGCG inhibition of EGFR leads to reduced AKT/PKB, FKHR, and BAD activity, increased levels of p53 and p27, and cell cycle arrest. Activity is also selectively altered in the ERK1/2 cascade. Sustained activation of ERK1/2 is necessary for cell survival and cell proliferation (48Roovers K. Assoian R.K. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Our studies show that ERK1/2 activity is reduced. However, the activity of ERK1/2 downstream targets is differentially regulated. For example, ELK1 activity is not changed in EGCG-treated cells, but activity of another ERK1/2 target, p90RSK, is markedly reduced by EGCG treatment. p90RSK phosphorylates the transcriptional co-activators p300 and CBP (cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein) (49Wang Z. Zhang B. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11138-11144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These acetyltransferases associate with transcriptional regulators to promote expression of genes required for S-phase progression (50Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Based on these functions, we propose that reduced p90RSK activity may contribute to the cessation of proliferation. EGCG and Cell Proliferation/Apoptosis—Our results show that the effects of EGCG can be reversed after short term treatment. However, long term treatment leads to an irreversible increase in sub-G1 cell numbers, increased numbers of annexin- and propidium iodide-positive cells, increased TUNEL staining, and increased caspase and PARP cleavage. These findings argue for a temporal progression wherein EGCG initially reversibly inhibits proliferation, as manifested, for example, by increased levels of p21, p27, and p53, and that prolonged EGCG treatment results in a irreversible apoptotic commitment as evidenced by increased TUNEL staining, PARP cleavage, etc. As ERK1/2 and AKT/PKB signaling is reported to be required for cell survival (25Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 51Cobb M.H. Hepler J.E. Cheng M. Robbins D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the transition from growth inhibition to apoptosis is due to a sustained EGCG-dependent inhibition of the ERK1/2 and AKT/PKB signaling cascades. Selective Inhibition of Kinase Activity by EGCG—As noted above, not all kinases are inhibited by EGCG. Neither JNK1/2 nor p38 activity is inhibited by EGCG. JNK1/2 activity remains unchanged, suggesting that it does not mediate the EGCG-associated responses. p38 is somewhat enhanced following treatment. This may be important, as p38 is known to enhance differentiation in surface epithelia and may contribute to cell death (52Eckert R.L. Efimova T. Balasubramanian S. Crish J.F. Bone F. Dashti S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 823-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 53Efimova T. Broome A.M. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34277-34285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As the four p38 isoforms are known to have differential effects (52Eckert R.L. Efimova T. Balasubramanian S. Crish J.F. Bone F. Dashti S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 823-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 53Efimova T. Broome A.M. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34277-34285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), additional studies will be required to identify which form is modified by EGCG in our system. Moreover, as noted above, phosphorylation of only selected targets downstream of ERK1/2 is suppressed by EGCG. ELK1 activity is not regulated, whereas p90RSK activity is markedly suppressed. Likewise, among AKT/PKB targets, FKHR and BAD activity are suppressed, but GSK3α/β activity is not regulated. This suggests that the net effect of EGCG treatment is the integration of a complex set of effects on intracellular kinase activity. Our results indicate that EGCG inhibits EGFR, the initial kinase in the EGF signaling cascade. Based on this finding, it would be logical to assume that the reduction in activity of kinases downstream of EGFR is solely due to the reduction in EGFR activity. However, in vitro cell-free assays suggest that the regulation may be more complex. Direct incubation of activated ERK1/2 or AKT/PKB with EGCG inhibits activity in an EGCG concentration-dependent manner. p38 activity is also reduced, but JNK1/2 activity is not regulated in this type of assay. This suggests, first, that the inhibition of activity is specific, as not all kinases are inhibited. Second, it is noteworthy that in most cases suppression of the enzymes in the cell-free in vitro assay matches the response in intact cells (ERK1/2 and AKT/PKB). Thus, it may be that ERK1/2 and AKT/PKB are inactivated in the cell by dual effects of EGCG, the suppression of incoming EGF-associated stimulation and direct inhibition of these kinases. However, some kinases (i.e. p38) are inhibited by EGCG in the cell-free system but not by EGCG treatment of intact cells. These findings point to the complexity of this regulation, suggesting that it is incorrect to assume that inactivation of the initial kinase in a cascade will result in inactivation of all downstream responses. EGCG and the Human Papillomavirus E6/E7 Oncoproteins—Human papillomavirus is a major etiological agent in the genesis of cervical cancer. Immortalization of normal cervical cells by HPV is the initial step in this process. This immortalization requires the action of the HPV oncoproteins, E6, which reduces p53 level, and E7, which increases cyclin E expression (54Martin L.G. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In principle, it would seem possible that HPV-immortalized cells might overcome the anti-survival effects of EGCG due to the effects of E6 and E7. However, the fact that EGCG treatment increases CDK inhibitor levels despite the E6/E7-positive background suggests that EGCG may be an effective therapeutic/preventive agent in cervical cancer."

Modulation of the activities of these factors might be linked with the initiation of the apoptotic signal.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) 1The abbreviations used are: UPP, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; dbcAMP, N6,2′-O-dibutyryl-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine iodide; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; TBST, Tris-buffered saline Tween-20; d1EGFP, destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: UPP, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; dbcAMP, N6,2′-O-dibutyryl-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine iodide; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; TBST, Tris-buffered saline Tween-20; d1EGFP, destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein. is the principal mechanism in the cell for controlled protein degradation. The pathway has been shown to be involved in the regulation of critical cellular processes such as transcription, cell cycle progression, oncogenesis, growth, and development, selective elimination of abnormal proteins, and antigen processing (21Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 82: 373-428Crossref Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). Degradation of a protein by UPP involves two distinct and successive steps: (i) covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to the target protein, and (ii) degradation of the targeted protein by 26S proteasome. 26S proteasome is a 2.1-MDa complex of which ∼65 subunits are divided into three sub-complexes: 20S, 19S, and 11S. The 20S core catalytic complex is a cylindrical stack of four seven-membered rings and is flanked on both sides by 19S regulatory complexes. Three distinct types of proteolytic activities have been defined for 20S proteasome: chymotrypsin-like (Tyr or Phe at P1), trypsin-like (Arg or Lys at P1), and post-glutamyl peptidyl hydrolytic-like (Glu at P1). Because UPP plays a crucial role in the degradation of many regulatory proteins that are necessary for cell growth, it is not surprising that the altered function of this pathway will affect cell survival. In fact, it has long been known that the inhibition of proteasome function induces apoptosis, depending on the cell types and conditions (22Sadoul R. Fernandez P.A. Quiquerez A.L. Martinou I. Maki M.

Proteasome substrates were obtained from the Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan. Expression plasmid for p53 (with V5 tag) was purchased from Invitrogen, and ubiquitin (with HA tag) was a kind gift from Dr. R. Takahashi, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan. The plasmid pd1EGFP-N1 was purchased from Clontech.

Neuro 2a and HeLa cells were obtained from National Centre for Cell Science, India. Cell Culture, Transfection, Treatments, and Viability Assay— Neuro2a and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. For transfection experiments, neuro 2a cells were plated into six-well tissue cultured plates at a sub-confluent density. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. Transfection efficiency was about 80–90%. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with curcumin and then processed for co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments. For cell viability assay, cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates; 24 h after seeding, media were replaced, and cells were treated with different doses of curcumin. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described previously (29Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Experiment—Twentyfour hours after transfection of ubiquitin or pd1EGFP plasmids, cells were treated with curcumin for 8 h. Cells were then washed with cold PBS, scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed on ice for 30 min with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 0.1 mm Na2VO5, complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were briefly sonicated, centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants (total soluble extract) were used for immunoprecipitation. Protein concentration was measured according to the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For each immunoprecipitation experiment, 200 μg of protein in 0.2 ml radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was incubated either with 5 μl (2 μg) of GFP antibody or 4 μl (2 μg) of HA antibody. After 5–6 h of incubation at 4 °C with rotation, 20 μl of protein G agarose beads were added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed 6× with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS (1×) sample buffer, vortexed, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The total cell lysate or the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated through SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were successively incubated in blocking buffer (5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween)), with primary antibody in TBST and then with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in TBST. Detection was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. All primary antibodies were used in 1:1000 dilutions for immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells grown on 60-mm tissue cultured plates were treated with curcumin. Eight hours after treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, washed extensively, then blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST for 1 h. Primary antibody (anti-cytochrome c) incubation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. After several washings with TBST, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, washed several times, and visualized by using a water lance in the confocal microscope. The digital images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Cytochrome c Release—Neuro 2a or HeLa cells were plated in 60-mm tissue cultured plates at sub-confluent density. Twenty-four hours later, cells were exposed to curcumin for 8 h and then incubated with 5 μm JC-1 fluorescence dye for 30 min in the CO2 incubator and washed several times with PBS. Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated qualitatively under a confocal microscope using 568 nm argon-krypton laser sources. To study the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, neuro 2a or HeLa cells grown on dishes were treated with different doses of curcumin for different time periods. The cells were then scraped, washed in the PBS, washed in the sucrose buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 250 mm sucrose) and resuspended in the same buffer. After1hof incubation on ice, cells were lysed by a B-type pestle Dounce homogenizer with 30 strokes. Homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were re-centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The final supernatants were used for immunoblotting experiments of cytochrome c. Assay of Proteasome Activity—Neuro 2a cells were plated in a six-well tissue cultured plate, and on the following day, cells were treated with varying doses of curcumin for 8 h. Cells were then isolated and suspended in 100 μl of proteasome assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol), lysed by sonication, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (25 μg) was incubated in the proteasome activity assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 μm of each proteasome substrate) for different time periods to obtain linearity of the reaction. The substrates Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-MCA, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA, and Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-MCA were used to determine trypsin, chymotrypsin, and post-glutamyl peptidyl hydrolytic-like activity, respectively. Protease activities at a particular time point (30 min) within the linear range were used to calculate the data. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 380-nm excitation and 460-nm emissions by using a Wallac multi-label counter. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Cycloheximide-chase Experiment—Neuro 2a cells were plated in a six-well tissue cultured plate, and on the following day, cells were transiently transfected with p53 expression plasmid. Twenty-four hours of post-transfection, cells were chased with 15 μg/ml of cycloheximide for different time periods in the presence or absence of curcumin. Cells collected at each time point were then processed for immunoblotting by anti-V5. Curcumin Kills Growing Neuro 2a Cells More Rapidly than Differentiated Neuro 2a Cells—Curcumin has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of various tumor cells, but it was not known whether the sensitivity of curcumin differs between dividing and differentiated cell. Here, we first studied the effect of curcumin on cell death between the dividing and the differentiated neuro 2a cells. Cells were plated onto 96-well tissue cultured plates, left untreated or treated with 5 mm of dbcAMP for 24 h for differentiation, and then exposed to various doses of curcumin for 8 h. Curcumin exposure dose-dependently induced the death of both dividing and differentiated cells (Fig. 1). However, the dividing neuro 2a cells were more sensitive to curcumin in comparison with the differentiated form. Curcumin also dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells (data not shown). Dibutyryl cyclic AMP modulates the apoptotic program in a wide variety of cells, accelerating apoptosis in some and delaying the rate of apoptosis in others (30Martin M.C. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Rossi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45041-45050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Kiefer J. Okret S. Jondal M. McConkey D.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 145: 1227-1230Google Scholar). We do not know what kinds of role dbcAMP are playing in the neuro 2a cell. Although we completely removed the dbcAMP from the media before adding curcumin, we still could not rule out the possibility that the partial resistance of differentiated cells toward curcumin could be due to the db-cAMP. In other words, the curcumin-induced cell death pattern seems to be very similar to the proteasome inhibitor-induced cell death, because proteasome inhibitors also target growing cells more rapidly than the differentiated cells (23Drexler H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 26Drexler H.C. Risau W. Konerding M.A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Curcumin exposure also induces neurite outgrowth in a manner similar to proteasome inhibitors (see Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Decreased turnover of the destabilized EGFP upon curcumin exposure. Neuro 2a cells were transiently transfected with pd1EGFP plasmids in a manner similar to that described in Fig. 3. Twenty-four hours later, cells were exposed to either curcumin or lactacystin for 8 h. Cells were then processed for microscopic observation (A), anti-GFP immunoblotting (B), and co-immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP, followed by blot detection with ubiquitin antibody (C). In B, β-tubulin was used as a loading control; in C, immunoprecipitated d1EGFP (detected by anti-GFP) was used as the reference. Lactacystin (Lact) was used at a dose of 5 μm. Cur, curcumin; Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of Proteasome Function by Curcumin—Because the curcumin-induced cell death pattern is very similar to the proteasome inhibitors, we thought that curcumin might be affecting the cellular proteasomal function, and thereby induce cell death. Therefore, we tested the effect of curcumin on cellular proteasome activity. Neuro 2a cells were treated with varying doses of curcumin for 8 h, cell lysates were made and processed for proteasome activity assays. As shown in Fig. 2, proteasome activity was dose-dependently inhibited by curcumin exposure. We measured chymotrypsin (Fig. 2A), trypsin, and post-glutamyl peptidyl-like (Fig. 2B) protease activity of the proteasome and observed that the activity of all three enzymes was dramatically inhibited by curcumin. We then compared the inhibitory effect of curcumin with lactacystin and MG132, the known proteasome inhibitors, and found that the curcumin was about 5-fold less potent than lactacystin and about 3.5-fold less potent than MG132 at a dose of 10 μm (Fig. 2C). No difference in proteasome activity was observed between dividing and differentiated neuro 2a cells. A similar inhibitory effect of curcumin on proteasome activity was also observed in HeLa cells. Because ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by the proteasome, inhibition of proteasome activity will result in increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Therefore, we next checked the ubiquitination profile. The neuro 2a cells were exposed to different doses of curcumin and cells were collected and processed for immunoblotting using ubiquitin antibody. As expected, curcumin treatment caused a massive accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, depending on the dose (Fig. 3, A and B). Curcumin treatments also dose-dependently decreased the free ubiquitin levels (Fig. 3, A and B). We do not know how exactly curcumin decreases the free ubiquitin levels. Curcumin exposure might lead to a massive build-up of misfolded and/or oxidized proteins, which ubiquitinates and ultimately decreases the free ubiquitin pool. Alternately, it might inhibit the expression of ubiquitin gene directly. We re-confirmed the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins by transient transfection of the ubiquitin construct into neuro 2a cells followed by coimmunoprecipitation with HA antibody and detection of the blot by anti-ubiquitin (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of proteasomal function by curcumin was further confirmed by using destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (d1EGFP), a model substrate for proteasome with a 1-h half-life. This d1EGFP vector contains a PEST (proline (P), glutamate (E), serine (S), and threonine (T)) signal sequence in its C-terminal, which can be targeted for degradation by the proteasome. Impaired proteasomal activity will increase the half-life of this protein. Neuro 2a cells were transiently transfected with the pd1EGFP expression plasmids. Twenty-four hours later, cells were exposed to various doses of curcumin or lactacystin for 8 h. Cells were then fixed, washed several times with PBS, and observed under the microscope. Cells were also processed for immunoprecipitation experiments by using anti-GFP followed by immunoblotting using ubiquitin antibody. Results showed that curcumin exposure increased the half-life and the accumulation of d1EGFP protein (Fig. 4, A and B). Curcumin treatment also increased the accumulation of ubiquitinated derivatives of d1EGFP (Fig. 4C). Similar results were also obtained upon exposure of lactacystin. Curcumin Induces Apoptosis Involving Mitochondria—Proteasome inhibition is known to induce apoptosis through mitochondrial cytochrome c release followed by sequential activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Because curcumin inhibits the proteasomal function, we tested the possible involvement of curcumin in mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent events. HeLa cells were treated with different doses of curcumin for different time periods and then were either subjected to JC-1 staining to study the changes of mitochondrial membrane potential or processed for immunofluorescence staining and immunoblot analysis of cytochrome c to study its release into cytosol from mitochondria. JC-1 is a potentially sensitive fluorescent dye that detects specifically polarized mitochondria as a red color. Treatment of curcumin dramatically changed the mitochondrial membrane potential, depending upon the dose, as can be evaluated from the disappearance of the red-dotted color in mitochondria (Fig. 5, top panel). Curcumin exposure also dose-dependently induced cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (Fig. 5, bottom panel). The changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 6A) and the release of cytochrome c (Fig. 6B) were noticed from two hours onwards, when curcumin was added at a dose of 10 μm. Similar results were also observed in neuro 2a cells (data not shown).Fig. 6Time response of curcumin upon changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release. HeLa cells were treated with 10 μm of curcumin for different time periods as indicated. The cells were then processed for JC-1 staining (A) and cytochrome c immunoblotting (B). In B, β-tubulin was used as a loading control. Cur, curcumin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the caspase-9 activation is initiated with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria followed by binding to apoptosis protease activating factor-1, we further examined the activation of caspase-9 and subsequent events after curcumin exposure. The neuro 2a cells were treated with different doses of curcumin for different time periods, cells lysates were made and then processed for immunoblotting by using antibody against caspase-9, caspase-3, and lamin B. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of curcumin dose- and time-dependently activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, followed by the cleavage of lamin B. Curcumin Exposure Increases the Half-life of p53—Several key cellular proteins, including p53, are known to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Therefore, inhibition of proteasomal function by curcumin is expected to alter the stability of various proteasome substrates. To test this possibility, we transiently transfected p53 expression plasmid to neuro 2a cells. Twenty-four hours later, cells were exposed to various doses of curcumin for 8 h and then processed for immunoblotting using V5 antibody. As expected, curcumin exposure increased the accumulation of p53 protein, depending upon the dose (Fig. 8A). Next, we performed cycloheximide-chase experiment to reconfirm the increased half-life of p53. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide (15 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of curcumin (10 μm) for different time periods. As shown in Fig. 8B, treatment of curcumin increased the half-life of p53. Curcumin has long been used as a popular dietary spice and herbal medicine in several southeastern countries. Recent evidence suggests that the curcumin has chemopreventive and anti-tumor activities because of its ability to induce apoptosis. Here, we report that the curcumin-induced apoptosis is mediated through the impairment of UPP function. We have shown that exposure of curcumin dose-dependently inhibits the cellular proteasome activity over time and increases the accumulations of ubiquitinated proteins. Curcumin also inhibits the degradation of destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (a model substrate for proteasome, with a half-life of about 1 h) and causes increased accumulations of its ubiquitinated derivatives. Second, we have observed that the curcumin induces apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways, an apoptotic pathway reported to be activated during pharmacological inhibition of proteasome function. Finally, like other proteasome inhibitors, curcumin also kills growing cells more rapidly than differentiated cells. How curcumin disturbs the cellular proteasome function is not clear. It could inhibit the proteasome function directly by blocking the 20S proteasome core cavity, or indirectly either by inhibiting the ubiquitin isopeptidase activity or by the generation of oxidative stress. Recently, curcumin has been shown to inhibit the ubiquitin isopeptidase activity (32Mullally J.E. Fitzpatrick F.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Inhibition of isopeptidase activity probably leads to the accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates and polyubiquitin because of the lack of ubiquitin recycling. Excessive accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates could conceivably create proteasome dysfunction. Curcumin could also induce proteasomal malfunction through the generation of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is known to inhibit the proteasome function (33Ding Q. Keller J.N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Okada K. Wangpoengtrakul C. Osawa T. Toyokuni S. Tanaka S. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23787-23793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and curcumin has been reported recently to induce the oxidative stress (14Woo J.H. Kim Y.H. Choi Y.J. Kim D.G. Lee K.S. Bae J.H. Mindo S. Ch J.S. Jeong Y.J. Jee Y.H. Park J.W. Kwon T.K. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 35Bhaumik S. Anjum R. Rangaraj N. Pardhasarradhi B.V.V. Khar A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our result favors this hypothesis, because severe mitochondrial abnormalities (observed by us and others) will ultimately lead to the generation of oxidative stress inside the cell. However, this hypothesis contrasts with several earlier reports that demonstrate the antioxidant role of curcumin (36Ruby A.J. Kuttan G. Babu K.D. Rajasekharan K.N. Kuttan R. Cancer Lett. 1995; 94: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 37Reddy A.C. Lokesh B.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 137: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Several key proteins involved in pathways regulating transcription, growth, and apoptosis are the substrate for proteasomal degradation, like IκB, p53, c-myc, and JNK (21Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 82: 373-428Crossref Scopus (3350) Google Scholar, 38Mitsiades N. Mitsiades C.S. Poulaki V. Chauhan D. Fanourakis G. Gu X. Bailey C. Joseph M. Libermann T.A. Treon S.P. Munshi N.C.

Richardson P.G. Hideshima T. Munshi N. Treon S.P. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4079-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibition also down-regulates various transcripts involved in cell growth/survival pathways and up-regulation of molecules implicated in proapoptotic pathway (38Mitsiades N. Mitsiades C.S. Poulaki V. Chauhan D. Fanourakis G. Gu X. Bailey C. Joseph M. Libermann T.A. Treon S.P. Munshi N.C. Richardson P.G. Hideshima T. Anderson K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Though the precise link between proteasome inhibition and induction of apoptosis is unknown, it is expected that the altered degradation or altered expression of those proteins will affect cell survival and promote apoptosis. In fact, we have shown that curcumin exposure led to the up-regulation of p53 by increasing its stability. Our observations of curcumin-induced proteasomal malfunction can now explain several earlier reported effects of curcumin-like down-regulation of NF-κB activity, generation of stress response, and apoptosis. Curcumin is very well known to inhibit the NF-κB activation (15Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Impaired proteasome function will inhibit the degradation of IκB and, thereby, block the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Because NF-κB activity is very essential for cell survival, its down-regulation would definitely promote cell death. Curcumin also has been reported to inhibit cell survival signal protein kinase B/Akt (40Chaudhary L.R. Hruska K.A. J. Cell.

However, contrasting results were reported by others (42Mukhopadhyay A. Banerjee S. Stafford L.J. Xia C. Liu M. Aggarwal B.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8852-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), where they have shown down-regulation of cyclin D1 (a substrate of proteasome) levels by curcumin and its reversal by lactacystin. One of the explanations could be the direct inhibitory effect of curcumin on cyclin D1 transcription (42Mukhopadhyay A. Banerjee S. Stafford L.J. Xia C. Liu M. Aggarwal B.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8852-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) that will ultimately decrease the protein levels. Treatment of lactacystin along with curcumin can increase the low levels of cyclin D1 protein by increasing the stability. Lactacystin could also affect the transcription of cyclin D1 levels. Further investigation is required to confirm the fact. Proteasome inhibition has been shown to induce dual (caspase-8 and caspase-9) apoptotic signaling pathways, consisting of early release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol and caspase-9 activation, followed by independent activation of the Fas/caspase-8 pathway (38Mitsiades N. Mitsiades C.S. Poulaki V. Chauhan D. Fanourakis G. Gu X. Bailey C. Joseph M. Libermann T.A. Treon S.P. Munshi N.C. Richardson P.G. Hideshima T. Anderson K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c binds to apoptosis protease-activating factor-1 and forms the apoptosome complex that activates caspase-9 and, in turn, cleaves and activates downstream executioner caspases. Here, we have observed curcumin-induced apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway involving caspase-9 activation, whereas others have reported the involvement of Fas/caspase-8 pathways (10Anto R.J. Mukhopadhyay A. Denning K. Aggarwal B.B. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 20Bush J.A. Cheung Jr., K.J. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Both apoptotic pathways are most likely involved in the curcumin-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our results indicate that curcumin-induced apoptosis is mediated through the impairment of UPP. Proteasome inhibitors are considered to be one of the promising groups of anticancer agent. Because curcumin inhibits proteasome function and has been found to be safe pharmacologically, it has enormous potential in the prevention and therapy of cancer."

The klotho gene encodes Klotho, a type I membrane protein that shares sequence similarity with members of the glycosidase family 1. Because Klotho lacks the glutamic acid residues that have been shown to be involved in the catalytic activity of this family of enzymes, the function of this protein was unknown. Here, we have studied the biochemical characteristics of recombinant Klotho. The purified chimeric Klotho-human IgG1 Fc protein (KLFc) was assayed with a series of 4-methylumbelliferyl (4Mu) β-glycosides as potential substrates. An enzymatic activity of Klotho was observed only with 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide in contrast to bovine liver β-glucuronidase, which exhibits a rather wide substrate specificity. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of KLFc was reduced by the addition of specific inhibitors of β-glucuronidase. A number of natural β-glucuronides were screened by competitive inhibition for KLFc β-glucuronidase. We found that steroid β-glucuronides such as β-estradiol 3-β-d-glucuronide, estrone 3-β-d-glucuronide, and estriol 3β-d-glucuronide were hydrolyzed by KLFc. The artificial fluorescent substrate and the steroid conjugates share a common phenolic structure. Collectively, these data suggest that Klotho functions as a novel β-glucuronidase and that steroid β-glucuronides are potential candidates for the natural substrate(s) of Klotho. klotho mutant mice provide a unique model to analyze mechanisms of aging because their phenotypes resemble those of human aging-associated disorders.

Expression of this gene is seen in renal tubule cells, parathyroid secretory cells, and epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. The extracellular domain of Klotho contains two internal repeats (termed mKL1 and mKL2) that display significant similarity to family 1 β-glycosidases (3Henrissat B. Biochem.

These enzymes are widely distributed throughout bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Family 1 glycosidases operate with a molecular mechanism leading to overall retention of the anomeric configuration and involving the formation and breakdown of a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate. Two Glu residues are directly involved in this catalytic mechanism, one acting as a nucleophile and the other as an acid/base (19Rye C.S. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, unlike other members of β-glycosidase family 1, Klotho does not possess these two catalytic glutamic acids. In the KL1 region, the nucleophilic Glu residue is present, but the acid/base Glu residue is replaced by an Asn residue. Inversely, in the KL2 region, the acid/base Glu residue is present, but the nucleophile is replaced by Ala and Ser residues in mouse and human Klotho, respectively (1Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T. Nishikawa S. Nagai R. Nabeshima Y.I. Nature. 1997; 390: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). Together with Klotho, other proteins form a distinct subfamily in glycosidase family 1. First, β-Klotho (βKL) (21Ito S. Kinoshita S. Shiraishi N. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Fujimori T. Nabeshima Y.I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 98: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), a type I membrane protein with 41.2% similarity to Klotho, contains two internal repeats highly homologous to those of family 1 glycosidases. Like in Klotho, the first repeat lacks the catalytic acid/base, whereas the second repeat lacks the nucleophile. Another protein, Klotho-LPH-related (KLPH) (22Ito S. Fujimori T. Hayashizaki Y. Nabeshima Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which is also a type I membrane protein, has a single extracellular domain with 37.5% similarity to the KL1 domain of the mouse Klotho proteins, and this domain lacks the acid/base catalytic residue. LPH (23Naim H.Y. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 553-561PubMed Google Scholar), a major glycosidase contributing to the metabolism of dietary lactose in mammals, is a membranebound enzyme that acts extracellularly. The mature form of this enzyme is composed of two internal repeats (LPH3 and LPH4, each belonging to glycosidase family 1) and a transmembrane domain with a short cytoplasmic domain at the carboxyl terminus. The overall structure of the mature form of LPH resembles that of Klotho, and each of the Klotho internal repeats exhibits 36–42% similarity to those of LPH, respectively. Unlike Klotho, however, each of the LPH repeats possesses the two catalytic glutamic acids of glycosidase family 1. In contrast, it should be noted that myrosinase (9Wittstock U. Halkier B.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 10Rask L. Andreasson E. Ekbom B. Eriksson S. Pontoppidan B. Meijer J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 93-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), a plant homolog with 28–32% similarity to Klotho, has S-glycosidase enzymatic activity, even though it lacks the glutamic acid that serves as a general acid/general base catalyst. For myrosinase, it has been shown that the acid/base residue is not necessary in the first step of catalysis because of the excellent leaving group ability of the aglycone of the natural substrates (glucosinolates). For the second step, Burmeister and colleagues (24Burmeister W.P. Cottaz S. Rollin P. Vasella A. Henrissat B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39385-39393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have shown by high resolution x-ray crystallography that ascorbate is a cofactor for myrosinase and substitutes for the function of the catalytic base. The deficiency of the Klotho proteins leads to impaired calcium homeostasis and enhancement of the expression of the 1α-hydroxylase gene, the rate-limiting enzyme in 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D synthesis, and results in persistently high serum levels of 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D in kl–/–mice (25Yoshida T. Fujimori T. Nabeshima Y. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26Tsujikawa H. Kurotaki Y. Fujimori T Fukuda K. Nabeshima Y. Mol. Endocrinology. 2003; 17: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This deterioration in the vitamin D endocrine system may participate in many of the phenotypes in kl–/–mice via toxicity resulting from increased levels of 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D and calcium (26Tsujikawa H. Kurotaki Y. Fujimori T Fukuda K. Nabeshima Y. Mol. Endocrinology. 2003; 17: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Notably, alleviation of many of the phenotypes is observed despite Klotho protein deficiency, when serum concentrations of calcium and 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D are restored to normal levels (26Tsujikawa H. Kurotaki Y. Fujimori T Fukuda K. Nabeshima Y. Mol. Endocrinology. 2003; 17: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). It is possible that Klotho is in the negative regulatory signaling circuit of vitamin D synthesis. As to how Klotho regulates calcium homeostasis, one of the most obvious hypotheses is that Klotho acts as an enzyme because it displays significant similarity to members of β-glycosidase family 1. If this is so, one may hypothesize that the putative substrate(s) is processed to an active form by the enzymatic action of Klotho, and thus Klotho action could be achieved via the action of the undefined bioactive substrate. We have examined the biochemical characteristics of Klotho to resolve its putative enzymatic activity. An unexpected synthetic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide, was found to be hydrolyzed by Klotho at a slow reaction rate but in a fairly specific manner compared with other family members. We then screened natural substrates with similar structures and found that steroid β-glucuronides were hydrolyzed by Klotho. Here we report that Klotho likely functions as an enzyme in a unique fashion paralleling that of β-glucuronidase. Expression Constructs—We designed a fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of mouse Klotho (amino acids 1–958) fused with human immunoglobulin Fc region at its carboxyl terminus. The expression vector was constructed as follows. Translational initiation sequences and restriction sites were introduced to the 5′-region of mouse klotho cDNA via PCR amplification using the primers 5-aaagaattcgccaccatgctagcccgcgcc-3 (mKL-S1; conjugated EcoRI site and an artificial Kozak initiation) and 5-catggctgaattctcccagtcag-3 (mKL-AS1). To add restriction enzyme recognition sites into the 3′-region, primers 5-catggctgaattctcccagtcag-3 (mKL-S2) and 5-cccagtgttccaggatccaggaagc-3 (mKL-AS2) were used. These PCR fragments were ligated with the PstI-FspI fragment of klotho cDNA and cloned into pSP72, giving PSP72-KL full 3. Then this was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated with the BamHI-XbaI fragment of the human IgG1 Fc gene (27Zettlmeissl G. Gregersen J.P. Duport J.M. Mehdi S. Reiner G. Seed B. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), inserted into expression vector pYT103 to give KLFc/pYT103. LPH (domains 3 and 4)-Fc fusion protein (LPHFc), used as a positive control, was designed similarly. Restriction sites were introduced to rat LPH cDNA by PCR amplification with primers 5-tggcttccggaggatcttgaac-3 (LPH-S1) and 5-aaactcgagatctgtctgtgcttctgcgatgcc-3 (LPH-AS1; conjugated BglI site at the 3′-region). This PCR fragment was ligated with BamHI-XbaI fragment of human IgG Fc gene and cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector to give LPHFc/pcDNA3. Cell Transfection—CHO cells were cultured in minimum essential medium-α (Sigma) containing 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.0001% (w/v) streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma). To establish CHO clones stably expressing the chimeric proteins, 4 μg of plasmids were introduced into 107 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). For KLFc, stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 250 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma) and 1∼10 μm methotrexate (Sigma). In the case of LPHFc, stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Purification of Recombinant Protein—CHO cells expressing KLFc were cultured in minimum essential medium-α containing 1% ultra low IgG fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.0001% (w/v) streptomycin, and l-glutamine. Conditioned media were collected after 3 days of culture and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to remove debris. Supernatants were filtrated using viva flow 50 and viva spin 20 (pore size; 100 kDa; Viva Science). To measure concentrations of secreted protein (KLFc or LPHFc), a serial dilution of the concentrated media was put into 96-well plates (Falcon) coated with goat anti-human IgG (Fc) antibody (American Qualex) and then incubated with goat anti-human IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Biosource). After the addition of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), absorbance at 450 nm was measured by a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Concentrated conditioned media were precleared twice with Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and transferred to a new tube with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After an incubation period of at least 2 h at 4 °C, beads were washed five times with 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and complete protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science) and twice with 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer. The beads bound with KLFc or LPHFc were used for enzymatic studies. Simultaneously, fusion protein quality was checked by SDS-PAGE and SYPRO Orange (Bio-Rad) staining. Western Blot Analysis—The samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated using a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAG gel; Daiichi Kagaku), and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon; Millipore). The blot was incubated with KM2119 rat anti-Klotho monoclonal antibody (28Kato Y. Arakawa E. Kinoshita S. Shirai A. Furuya A. Yamano K. Nakamura K. Iida A. Anazawa H. Koh N. Iwano A. Imura A. Fujimori T. Kuro-o M. Hanai N. Takeshige K. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) followed by goat anti-rat IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Biosource). Bands were visualized by exposure to x-ray film (HyperFilm MP; Amersham Biosciences) after incubation with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Staining—After SDS-PAGE, gels were incubated at 7.5% acetic acid containing 0.05% SYPRO Orange for 16 h at room temperature. Gels were washed with 7.5% acetic acid for 30 s and double distilled H2O. Fluorescence intensities were measured by STORM (Molecular Dynamics) using a blue filter. Detection of Enzyme Activities—We examined the potential substrates for the general β-glucosidases. The standard reaction buffer contained 0.5 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl (4Mu) β-d-glycosides (glucuronide, glucoside, galactoside, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucoside, or mannoside) (Sigma), 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, 0.05 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and 20 μg of KLFc. The reaction was carried out in a final volume of 100 μl. Fluorescence intensities were measured at several time points with a multilabel counter ARVOsx (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 470 nm. Hydrolyzed products were quantified on the basis of 4-methylumbelliferone fluorescence (29Chester M.A. Hultberg B. Ockerman P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Concentrated conditioned media from nontransfected CHO were used as a negative control after the addition of comparable amounts of purified human IgG1 (Athens Research and Technology). β-Glucosidase from sweet almonds (Sigma), β-glucuronidase from bovine liver (Sigma), and LPHFc were used for reference. To determine optimum pH, a series of 0.1 m sodium citrate buffers, between pH 4.5 and 6.0, and 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffers, between pH 6.0 and 8.0, were used. 0.1∼1 mm divalent metal ions were tested by adding CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, or ZnCl2 to the standard reaction condition to examine the effects of divalent metal ions. Then we tested other fluorescent substrate conjugated β-glucuronides to confirm β-glucuronidase activity of KLFc. 0.5 mm fluorescein di-β-glucuronide (FD-GlcU) (Molecular Probes) and ELF97™-β-glucuronide (ELF97-GlcU) (Molecular Probes) were reacted under standard conditions and fluorescence intensities were measured with the same methods as mentioned above. The sensitivity against inhibitors of β-glucuronidase was assayed using 0.1 μm∼1 mm d-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone (Sigma) and taurocholic acid (Sigma) added to the standard reaction condition. Calculation of Kinetic Constants—Assays to determine the Km value and Vmax were performed at 37 °C in reaction buffer containing 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, 0.05 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and 20 μg of KLFc protein. For determination, various 4Mu-GlcU concentrations between 0.0125 and 3.2 mm were tested. At each incubation time point, 1 μl of reaction buffer containing reaction products was collected and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 0.25 m Na2CO3 buffer. Fluorescence intensities were measured as above. Screening of Natural Substrates—For the screening of natural substrates, steroid glucuronides (β-estradiol 3-β-glucuronide (estradiol3GlcU), β-estradiol 17-β-glucuronide (estradiol-17GlcU), androsterone glucuronide (androsterone-GlcU), etiocholan-3α-ol-17-one glucuronide (etiocholan-3α-ol-17-one-GlcU), testosterone β-glucuronide (testosterone-GlcU), estrone 3-β-glucuronide (estrone-3GlcU), 5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol glucuronide (5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol-GlcU), dehydroisoandrosterone 3-glucuronide (dehydroisoandrosterone-3GlcU), 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol 17β-d-glucuronide (5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol 17GlcU), estriol 17β-β-d-glucuronide (estriol-17GlcU), estriol 16α-β-d-glucuronide (estriol-16GlcU), and estriol 3β-d-glucuronide (estriol-3GlcU) (Sigma), disaccharides of proteoglycan (Chondrosine, IdoUA-2S-GlcNS-6S, IdoUA-GlcNS-6S, IdoUA-GlcNS, IdoUA-GlcNAc-6S, IdoUA-GalNAc, IdoUA-GalNAc-4S, IdoUA-GalNAc-6S, IdoUA-GalNAc-4S, 6S, IdoUA-GlcNAc, GlcA-GalNAc-4S and GlcA-GalNAc-6S) (Seikagaku Kou-gyou Co. Ltd. and Dextra Laboratories, Ltd.), and intact proteoglycans (chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, and heparan sulfate) (Seikagaku Kou-gyou Co. Ltd.) were tested by competitive inhibition assays. For the inhibition assays, each reagent (5 mm) was added to standard reactions including KLFc and 0.1 mm 4Mu-GlcU. To test the hydrolysis of reagents, each substrate (1 mm) was incubated with KLFc fusion proteins under the standard conditions for 30 h. Estradiol-3GlcU and estrone-3GlcU were dissolved into water; etiocholan-3α-ol-17-one-GlcU, testosterone-β-d-GlcU, and 5β-pregnane-3α,20-α-diol-GlcU were dissolved into ethanol; 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol-17-GlcU and estriol-3GlcU were dissolved into dimethyl sulfoxide; estradiol-17GlcU, dehydroisoandrosterone-3GlcU, estriol-17GlcU, and estriol-16GlcU were dissolved into N,N-dimethylformamide, respectively. To analyze the hydrolysis of the steroid-GlcUs, samples were applied on a HPLC (Waters Alliance HPLC system 2695EX separation module) system equipped with a Waters dual λ UV-visible detector. Symmetry C18 columns (4.6 × 150 mm; Waters) were used in reversed phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. 10-μl samples were injected on the analytical column. The gradient program of mobile phase 1 was as follows: 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid and 10% acetonitrile in water were isocratically eluted for 0 min, then 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% acetonitrile for 10 min, and 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid and 10% acetonitrile for 10.1 min. The absorbance at 210 or 260 nm was monitored. Finally, we calculated the catalytic parameters for estrane GlcUs. KLFc-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions of estrane-GlcUs were conducted at various substrate concentrations. Catalytic constants were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots of three experiments using estrane-GlcUs. To analyze the hydrolysis of chondrosine, amino acid analysis was performed using an Hitachi L-8500 that allows automatic on-line mixing of the ninhydrin reagent. 10 μl was injected onto the analytical column. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Klotho—To express recombinant Klotho, we constructed an expression vector using mouse klotho cDNA and human immunoglobulin gene. The region encoding the extracellular domain of Klotho was fused to DNA encoding the human immunoglobulin Fc region. For the control experiments, we used mouse LPH, a type 1 membrane protein with two internal repeats homologous to family 1 β-glucosidases. The expression vector for LPHFc was constructed similarly to that for KLFc. These expression constructs were introduced into CHO cells to obtain stable transfectants. Conditioned media from these clones were concentrated and subjected to Western blot analysis. The fusion proteins were detected at relative molecular masses of 150 kDa (KLFc) and 160 kDa (LPHFc), respectively (Fig. 1). Recombinant protein concentrations were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with anti-human IgG antibody. To confirm the reliability of the estimation and to examine the quality of purified fusion proteins, KLFc and LPHFc (200 ng each as estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with SYPRO Orange to visualize proteins (Fig. 2). The KLFc protein was detected as a single band, indicating that this fusion protein could be purified without proteolysis (Fig. 2, lane 1). The LPHFc protein could also be purified (lane 2). The weakly detected 70 kDa bands are likely contamination of bovine serum albumin from fetal bovine serum. A bovine serum albumin serial dilution was used as a standard for quantification (Fig. 2, lanes 4-7). Signal intensities were compared with standards to calculate the quantities of KLFc and LPHFc. The results correlated well with those obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We used the purified fusion proteins for the following analysis.Fig. 2Assay of the quality and quantity of purified fusion proteins. Conditioned media were collected from KLFc-expressing, LPHFc-expressing, or parental CHO cells. Fc-tagged proteins were purified with protein A beads. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE after denaturation under reducing conditions. To visualize whole proteins, the gels were stained subsequently with SYPRO Orange. Lane 1, KLFc; lane 2, LPHFc; lane 3, CHO-conditioned media contained 0.2 μg of human IgG1 as a control; lanes 4–7, bovine serum albumin used as a standard for estimation of quantity (0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.0625 μg, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Enzymatic Activity of Klotho—To investigate the enzymatic activity of the KLFc protein, a panel of 4Mu-glycosides was tested. These substrates are not fluorescent, but their hydrolysis liberates fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone, which was measured using a fluorometer as a function of time to estimate the quantity of hydrolyzed substrate. Eight types of glycosides were tested. KLFc reacted specifically with 4Mu-GlcU and hydrolyzed this substrate. 2O. Tohyama, A. Imura, A. Iwano, J.-N. Freund, B. Henrissat, T. Fujimori, and Y.-i. Nabeshima, unpublished data. Changes in the fluorescence intensity of other potential substrates were similar to the background levels observed with IgG1 (Table I), indicating that KLFc does not hydrolyze these molecules. On the other hand, LPHFc, β-glucosidase, and β-glucuronidase were active on a set of substrates as shown in Table I. Table I shows that the specific activity of Klotho is about 30 times less than that of β-glucuronidase from bovine liver and one-third of that from rat LPH. To exclude clonal variation, we tested three other independently established transfectants and confirmed that fusion proteins obtained from these clones gave rise to similar results in a dose-dependent manner. 2O. Tohyama, A. Imura, A. Iwano, J.-N. Freund, B. Henrissat, T. Fujimori, and Y.-i. Nabeshima, unpublished data. Furthermore, 0.5 mm FD-GlcU and ELF97-GlcU, the other fluorescent substrate-conjugated β-glucuronic acids, were tested and found to be hydrolyzed under the same conditions, thus confirming the β-glucuronidase activity of KLFc proteins.2Table IMeasurement of the enzymatic activity of recombinant KLFc proteinEnzymeSubstrateGlcGalGlcNAcGalNAcGlcUd-FucManXylpmol/h/μgKlotho0.34 ± 0.131.34 ± 0.421.71 ± 0.961.43 ± 0.2772.8 ± 6.790.23 ± 0.110.91 ± 0.720.61 ± 0.27LPH1,103.4 ± 73.6188.9 ± 3.986.5 ± 2.556.85 ± 0.9202.5 ± 39.4819,400.4 ± 923.8260.9 ± 60.8106.4 ± 21.8IgG0.70 ± 0.030.19 ± 0.181.61 ± 0.120.80 ± 0.210.44 ± 0.140.10 ± 0.060.44 ± 0.380.38 ± 0.17β-Glucosidase51,070 ± 2,8921,232.8 ± 85.81,293.5 ± 39.5489.7 ± 287.291.0 ± 146.445,036 ± 1,808.7162.5 ± 115.61,317.3 ± 724.3β-Glucuronidase34 ± 2.5491.7 ± 26.81669.3 ± 66.01444.4 ± 97.61940.3 ± 23.138.2 ± 3.1117.0 ± 3.011.7 ± 3.78 Open table in a new tab Calculation of Rate Parameters—Substrate saturation for the KLFc fusion protein was examined with a series of 4Mu-GlcU concentrations.

There is evidence from recent studies that BMP signaling in osteoblasts is controlled by an ubiquitin-proteasome regulatory mechanism involving a cascade of enzymatic reactions. The specificity of protein ubiquitination is determined by E3 ubiquitin ligases, which play a crucial role in defining substrate specificity and subsequent protein degradation by 26S proteasomes. We have examined the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1), a member of the Hect domain family of E3 ubiquitin ligases in osteoblast function. Smurf1 has been found to interact with BMP-activated Smad1 and -5 and to mediate degradation of these Smad proteins. Recently we have found that Smurf1 mediates the protein degradation of the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Runx2/Cbfa1. To determine the role of Smurf1 in osteoblast differentiation, in the present studies we transfected a Smurf1 expression plasmid into 2T3 osteoblast precursor cells and found that Smurf1 overexpression inhibits BMP signaling and osteoblast differentiation. To further investigate the role of Smurf1 in bone formation in vivo, we generated transgenic mice in which expression of the epitope-tagged Smurf1 transgene was targeted to osteoblasts using the murine 2.3-kb osteoblast-specific type I collagen promoter. In these transgenic mice, bone formation was significantly reduced during postnatal life.

Orthop. 1998; 346: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The role of BMPs in postnatal bone formation and maintenance of bone mass has recently been demonstrated in several animal models. In previous studies, we have shown that selective blockage of BMP receptor signaling by over-expression of a dominant-negative type I BMP receptor in osteoblasts inhibits postnatal bone growth and bone formation (3Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Noggin and sclerostin, two glycoproteins, which are produced in bone cells, demonstrate high affinity binding to BMP ligands and prevent the interaction between BMP ligands and their cognate receptors (4Groppe J. Greenwald J. Wiater E. Rodriguez-Leon J. Economides A.N. Kwiatkowski W. Affolter M. Vale W.W. Belmonte J.C. Choe S. Nature. 2002; 420: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Noggin has high affinity to bind BMP-2, -4, and -7 (5Smith W.C. Harland R.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 829-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) 2M. Zhao, M. Qiao, G. R. Mundy, and D.

Recently it has been shown that transgenic mice overexpressing noggin or sclerostin transgene in osteoblasts develop an osteopenic/osteoporotic phenotype (8Devlin R.D. Du Z. Pereira R.C. Kimble R.B.

However, the mechanism(s), that regulate BMP signaling during osteoblast differentiation are not fully understood. One of the important regulatory mechanisms by which the activity of BMP signaling proteins is modulated involves ubquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway is essential for various important biological processes including cell cycle progression, gene transcription, and signal transduction (9Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar, 10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). The formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates requires three enzymes that participate in a cascade of ubiquitin transfer reactions: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). The specificity of protein ubiquitination is determined by E3 enzymes, and proteins polyubiquitinated by these enzymes are targeted to undergo degradation primarily by the 26S proteasome (11Hershko A. Cell. 1983; 34: 11-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Smurf1 is a member of the Hect domain family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and has been found to interact not only with BMP signaling proteins Smad1 and 5 but also the bone-specific transcription factor Runx2/Cbfa1 and type I BMP receptors and to mediate the degradation of these proteins (13Zhu H.

Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The role of Smurf2 in osteoblast differentiation is currently unknown. To determine the role of Smurf1 in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, in the present studies we have utilized a Smurf1 expression plasmid stably transfected into osteoblast precursor 2T3 cells. We also generated transgenic mice in which expression of a Smurf1 transgene is targeted to osteoblasts using the osteoblast-specific type I collagen promoter (21Rossert J.A. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We found that expression of Smurf1 inhibits osteoblast differentiation in 2T3 cells. In addition, overexpression of Smurf1 in osteoblasts in vivo causes a significant reduction in trabecular bone volume and bone formation rates. Moreover, both osteoblast proliferation and differentiation are inhibited in Smurf1 transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate that Smurf1 plays a specific role in regulating BMP signaling, osteoblast differentiation, and bone formation. Cell Culture and Transfection—2T3 osteoblast precursor cells were cultured in α minimal essential medium (αMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (22Chen D. Ji X. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Karsenty G. Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged Smurf1 expression plasmid and pcDNA3 empty vector (1 μg/well) were stably transfected into 2T3 cells in 6-well culture plates using LipofectAMINE plus reagents (Invitrogen). After transfection (48 h), cells were treated with G418 (300 μg/ml) for 3 weeks. Pooled G418-resistant cells were then cloned using a limiting dilution method and expression of Smurf1 mRNA and protein in selected subclones screened. Four Smurf1-positive subclones (2T3/Smurf1) were analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), expression of osteoblast marker genes and mineralized bone nodule formation, and compared with control subclones (2T3/vector). Generation of Col1a1-Smurf1 Transgenic Mice—To generate the Col1a1(2.3)-Smurf1 transgene, the truncated type IB BMP receptor (trBMPR-IB) cDNA at the BamHI site of a Col1a1-trBMPR-IB vector (3Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was replaced with a FLAG-tagged full-length Smurf1 cDNA. The transgene was released by KpnI/NarI digestion. Approximately 1 to 2 μl of a solution of purified DNA at a concentration of 2 μg/ml was microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized one-cell mouse embryos derived from C57BL/6 mice. The injected embryos were reimplanted into B6D2F1 (C57BL/6 x DBA/2) pseudopregnant females. The presence of the transgene in the resulting pups was determined by preparing genomic DNA from the tail tissue and assaying by Southern blot analysis and PCR. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity Assay—Empty vector or Smurf1 expressing-2T3 subclones or primary osteoblasts isolated from wild-type or Col1a1-Smurf1 transgenic mice were plated into 96-well culture plates and grown to ∼60% confluence. The medium was then changed into αMEM with 2% FCS. 48 h after incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, and cell lysates were extracted with 0.05% Triton X-100. ALP activity in cell lysates was measured using a Sigma ALP assay kit (Sigma) and normalized by the protein content. Mineralized Bone Nodule Formation Assay—2T3/vector and 2T3/Smurf1 cells and primary osteoblasts isolated from the calvariae of neonatal wild-type and Smurf1 transgenic mice were used for mineralized bone nodule formation assays as described previously (3Zhao M.

Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The cells were plated in 24-well culture plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and cultured with αMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. When the cells reached confluence (day 0), the medium was changed to αMEM containing 5% FCS, 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate with or without 50 ng/ml BMP-2. The medium was changed every other day and fresh reagents were added. After 10-day incubation, von Kossa staining was performed to analyze the formation of mineralized bone nodules. Luciferase Assay—The BMP and TGF-β signaling reporter constructs, 12×SBE-OC-Luc (14Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and p3TP-Lux (23Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected into 2T3/vector and 2T3/Smurf1 cells. Cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml BMP-2 or 2 ng/ml TGF-β (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cell lysates were extracted 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using a Promega luciferase assay kit and normalized by β-galactosidase activity. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from 2T3/vector and 2T3/Smurf1 cells using RNAzol B solution (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Expression of osteoblast-specific genes was analyzed by Northern analysis (22Chen D. Ji X. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Karsenty G. Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Expression of Smurf1 transgene in 2T3/Smurf1 cells and primary osteoblasts isolated from Col1a1-Smurf1 transgenic mice was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. For reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, DNase I-treated total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT). cDNA were amplified using primers specific for the FLAG-Smurf1 transgene. Western Blot Analysis—To determine expression of Smurf1 and to examine Smad1 and Runx2 protein levels in 2T3/Smurf1 cells, cell lysates were extracted from 2T3/vector and 2T3/Smurf1 cells or from osteoblasts isolated from wild-type and transgenic mice, mixed with sample buffer, and run on SDS-PAGE gels (Mini-PROTEIN II Ready gels, Bio-Rad). The proteins were transblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) in transblotting buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.0; TBS-T) at 4 °C, 100v for 1 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. Incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was performed at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then washed five times with TBS-T for 5 min. Immunostaining was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences, Backinghamshire, UK). Histological and Histomorphometric Analyses—Histomorphometric analyses were performed on proximal tibial metaphyses in 3-month-old transgenic and wild-type mice that had been injected intraperitoneal with calcein 8 and 2 days before animals were sacrificed (3Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Half of the bone samples from either group were decalcified in 14% EDTA, embedded in paraffin, and sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin or for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. Histological changes in trabecular bones were analyzed and changes in osteoblast and osteoclast numbers quantitated as described previously (3Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The other half of the bone samples were embedded un-decalcified in methylmethacrylate and sections used for measurements of bone formation rate (BFR) or stained with von Kossa to determine changes in the cancellous bone mineralization and changes in bone volume. Trabecular bone volume was quantitated in the entire bone marrow cavity 1-3 mm from the growth plates and expressed as a percentage of total tissue volume. Values were expressed as the means ± S.E. calculated from three non-consecutive sections per mouse from each of 10 transgenic mice and 10 wild-type littermates. The calcein-labeled bone surface or mineralizing surface and the distance between two fluorescent labels was measured, and mineral appositional rates (μm/day) and bone formation rates (BFR/bone surface, μm3/μm2/day) were calculated (3Zhao M.

BrdUrd Labeling—5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling was performed using Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA BrdUrd labeling reagent and BrdUrd staining kit according to the manufacture's protocols (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Briefly, BrdUrd was injected intraperitonally into mice 24 h before sacrifice. Bone tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. 3-4 μm thick sections were cut and placed on polylysine-coated slides. Slides were dried in a 60 °C oven overnight, deparaffinized in two changes of xylene for 5 min each, and then rehydrated in a graded series of alcohol. Slides were stained for BrdUrd according to manufacture's protocols. Streptavidin-peroxidase was used as a signal generator for the BrdUrd system, and deaminobenzidine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide was used as a chromogen, staining BrdUrd-incorporated nuclei dark brown (24Feng J.Q.

Smurf1 Inhibits Osteoblast Differentiation in Vitro—To determine the effect of Smurf1 on osteoblast differentiation, subclones of the osteoblast precursor 2T3 cells stably overexpressing wild-type Smurf1 were generated. Four individual clones expressing high levels of Smurf1 mRNA (Fig. 1a) and Smurf1 protein (Fig. 1b) were selected and further characterized. Four clones transfected with empty vector were used as controls. The effects of Smurf1 on ALP activity, expression of osteoblast-specific genes, and mineralized bone nodule formation in these cells were examined. In 2T3/Smurf1 clones, there was an over 80% reduction in ALP activity compared with 2T3/vector clones (Fig. 1c). Expression of several osteoblast-specific genes, osterix, Runx2, type I collagen, and osteocalcin, were also markedly decreased in 2T3/ Smurf1 cells (Fig. 1d). To determine the effect of Smurf1 on osteoblast terminal differentiation, we examined the effect of Smurf1 on formation of mineralized bone nodules. By day 10 in the presence of ascorbic acid, β-glycerol phosphate and BMP-2 (50 ng/ml), 2T3/vector subclones had formed bone nodules. In contrast, in cultures of 2T3/Smurf1 cells, there were no bone nodules formed even in the presence of the same amount of BMP-2 (Fig. 1e), demonstrating that Smurf1 plays a specific role in BMP signaling and osteoblast differentiation. Smurf1 Specifically Inhibits BMP Signaling—We then determined the effects of Smurf1 on steady-state levels of Smad1 and Runx2. In 2T3/Smurf1 cells, Smad1 and Runx2 levels were significantly reduced compared with 2T3/vector cells (Fig. 2, a and b). Since Runx2 expression is regulated by the BMP/Smad1 signaling pathway, the decrease in Runx2 protein could be due to a combination of reduced mRNA expression and increased protein degradation. It has been reported that Smurf1 forms a complex with Smad7, which is then exported from the nucleus and targeted to the type I TGF-β receptor for degradation (25Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G.

To determine the effect of Smurf1 on BMP and TGF-β signaling, we transfected a BMP signaling reporter 12×SBE-OC-Luc construct (14Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and the TGF-β signaling reporter p3TP-Lux construct (23Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into 2T3/vector and 2T3/Smurf1 cells and treated cells with BMP-2 or TGF-β. In 2T3/Smurf1 cells, BMP signaling was significantly reduced (Fig. 2c). In contrast, TGF-β signaling remained intact in 2T3/Smurf1 cells (Fig. 2d), suggesting that Smurf1 specifically inhibits BMP signaling in osteoblast precursor cells. Transfection of Smad6 into 2T3/Smurf1 cells further inhibited BMP signaling (Fig. 2c), suggesting that Smad6 and Smurf1 inhibit BMP signaling by independent pathways. Smurf1 Inhibits Bone Formation in Vivo—To further determine whether Smurf1 plays an essential role in bone formation in vivo, we generated transgenic mice (Col1a1-Smurf1) in which expression of a FLAG-tagged Smurf1 transgene was targeted to osteoblasts using the 2.3-kb type I collagen promoter (21Rossert J.A. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The Col1a1-Smurf1 transgenic mice were viable and fertile and survived into adulthood and expression of the FLAG-Smurf1 transgene in osteoblasts isolated from the transgenic mice was confirmed (Fig. 3a). Histological analyses of two independent lines of 3-month-old transgenic mice revealed a reduction of about 33% in average trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) (Fig. 3, b and c). Dynamic histomorphometric analyses showed a significant decrease of about 40% in bone formation rates in transgenic mice compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3, d and e). In addition, ALP staining in trabecular bone was also significantly decreased in Smurf1 transgenic mice (Fig. 3f). There was a significant decrease (35%) in osteoblast numbers on cancellous bone surfaces (Fig. 4a) but not osteoclast numbers (data not shown) in Smurf1 transgenic mice. To determine whether osteoblast proliferation per se was affected in Smurf1 transgenic mice, we performed BrdUrd labeling experiments and found a significant decrease (38%) in BrdUrd-positive cells on periosteal surfaces of the calvariae of transgenic mice (Fig. 4, b and c). In contrast, osteoblast apoptosis as detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was not altered in Smurf1 transgenic mice (data not shown). We next isolated primary osteoblasts from 4-day-old neonatal transgenic mice and wild-type littermates and examined ALP activity and mineralized bone nodule formation. Similar to our in vitro findings, ALP activity was significantly reduced (60%) (Fig. 4d), and mineralized bone nodule formation was inhibited in long term cultures of osteoblasts isolated from transgenic mice compared with those from wild-type littermates (Fig. 4e). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that bone formation defects found in Smurf1 transgenic mice are mainly due to decreased osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. We have demonstrated for the first time that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 plays a specific role in bone formation in vivo and that expression of Smurf1 inhibits osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our data indicate that these effects of Smurf1 on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation are likely due to its specific inhibition of BMP signaling in osteoblasts. These new findings are consistent with our previous reports that expression of a dominant-negative mutant and catalytically inactive Smurf1 enhanced osteoblast differentiation in BMP-2-responsive osteoblast precursor C2C12 and 2T3 cells (14Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with a recent report that expression of Smurf1 in C2C12 cells antagonized BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation (16Ying S.X. Hussain Z.J. Zhang Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39029-39036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutations in dSmurf in Drosophila also lead to enhanced dpp (a Drosophila homologue of BMP-2/4) signaling and expression of downstream target genes of dpp (27Podos S.D. Hanson K.K. Wang Y. Ferguson E.L. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that Smurf1 plays a specific role in regulating BMP signaling and osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Our current studies were performed using an overexpression approach. The role of Smurf1 in bone formation in vivo needs to be further verified either by overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant Smurf1 in osteoblasts in transgenic mice or by generating Smurf1 null mutant mice, specific to the osteoblast lineage. Nevertheless, our current results argue that Smurf1 plays a specific and physiological role in bone formation in vivo. Osteoporosis remains a major public health problem in the United States and the Western world and identification and development of anabolic agents for the treatment of osteoporosis remains. Most of the drugs currently used in the treatment of osteoporosis are bone resorption inhibitors including bisphosphonates as well as estrogen and related compounds. Although these types of drugs stabilize bone mass and prevent further bone loss, they have not been shown to increase or restore bone mass. This is a critical shortcoming because patients with established osteoporosis may have lost more than 50% of bone mass at critical sites in the skeleton at time of diagnosis. Therefore, a drug that stimulates formation of a substantial amount of new bone is highly desirable. Recently we have discovered that selective inhibitors of the osteoblast proteasome stimulate bone formation in vivo and in vitro (28Garrett I.R. Chen D. Gutierrez G. Rossini G. Zhao M. Escobedo A. Kim K.B. Hu S. Crews C.M. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1771-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), suggesting that selective inhibition of proteasome-mediated proteolytic degradation could have beneficial effects on bone. Currently available proteasome inhibitors, however, may not be ideal drugs to treat patients with osteoporosis due to their non-selectivity and potential side effects. Our data herein demonstrate that the E3 ligase Smurf1 plays specific roles in recognizing several protein substrates critical for BMP signaling and mediates subsequent proteasomal degradation of these proteins. This now identifies the E3 ligase Smurf1 as a potential molecular target for the development of new anti-osteoporosis drugs. We thank Dr. Gerald Thomsen (Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology and Institute for Cell and Developmental Biology, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) for providing us the FLAG-Smurf1 plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W2033505090,"C-terminal truncation of ADAMTS-4 from the p68 form to the p53 form is required for activation of its capacity to cleave the Glu373-Ala374 interglobular domain bond of aggrecan. In transfected human chondrosarcoma cells, this process is not autoproteolytic because the same products form with an inactive mutant of ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motif 4) and truncation is completely blocked by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. Instead, activation can be mediated by glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored membrane type 4-matrix metalloproteinase (MT4-MMP, MMP-17) because co-transfection with the active form of MT4-MMP markedly enhanced activation, whereas an inactive mutant of MT4-MMP was ineffective. Treatment of co-transfected cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C liberated the complex of MT4-MMP and p68 ADAMTS4 from the cell membrane, but the p53 ADAMTS4 remained associated. Specific glycosaminoglycan lyase digestions, followed by product analyses using fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation experiments, showed that the p53 form is associated with syndecan-1 through both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. We conclude that ADAMTS-4 activation in this cell system involves the coordinated activity of both glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored MT4-MMP and the proteoglycan form of syndecan-1 on the cell surface.

Uncontrolled proteolysis of ECM has also been implicated in many disease states, such as those characterized by tumor invasion (2Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M.

Recently, it has become clear that proteolysis of the major constituents of the mammalian ECM, i.e. collagens and proteoglycans, is achieved not only by the classical matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family (such as MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -13) but also by a relatively new group of metalloproteinases called the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motif) family. This group of about 20 related species (6Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol.

Gene. 2002; 283: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) appears to exhibit a more restricted substrate specificity than MMPs. For example, ADAMTS-2, -3, and -14 appear to be specific procollagen-N-proteinases (8Colige A. Vandenberghe I. Thiry M. Lambert C.A. Van Beeumen J. Li S.W. Prockop D.J. Lapiere C.M. Nusgens B.V. J.

Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Control of both MMP and ADAMTS activity is exerted at multiple points including transcription, translation, post-translational processing (including zymogen activation), substrate accessibility, and inhibition by naturally occurring inhibitors such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs). Zymogen activation of both MMPs and ADAMTSs requires, minimally, the removal of the N-terminal prodomain; this can be achieved by intracellular furin-mediated cleavage, such as occurs with the MT-MMPs (12Puente X.S. Pendas A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar) and the ADAMTSs (7Cal S. Obaya A.J. Llamazares M. Garabaya C. Quesada V. Lopez-Otin C. Gene. 2002; 283: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Prodomain removal can also be achieved by the action of other MMPs, such as for the MT1-MMP-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2 (13Worley J.R. Thompkins P.B. Lee M.H. Hutton M. Soloway P. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. Knauper V. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 799-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or through activation cascades involving co-activators such as plasmin (14Hahn-Dantona E. Ramos-DeSimone N.

In this regard, we have been studying the activation of ADAMTS4 in a human chondrosarcoma cell line stably transfected to express the full-length protein and have found (15Gao G. Westling J.

Moreover, in this cell system, the C-terminal truncation is inhibited by TIMP-1 and a hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitor, suggesting a requirement for a TIMP-1-sensitive MMP in the activation process, an idea first suggested by the finding of TIMP-1 and n-carboxyalkyl peptide inhibition of IL-1-mediated aggrecanolysis in bovine cartilage explants (16Bonassar L.J. Sandy J.D. Lark M.W. Plaas A.H. Frank E.H. Grodzinsky A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, in previous work on the induction of aggrecanase-mediated aggrecan degradation in rat chondrosarcoma cells and bovine cartilage explants (17Sandy J.D. Thompson V. Verscharen C. Gamett D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Patwari P. Kurz B. Sandy J.D. Grodzinsky A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we found that both IL-1 and retinoic acid-induced aggrecanolysis was markedly inhibited by agents (such as mannosamine, 2-deoxyfluoroglucose, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC)), which are known to interfere with the synthesis or function of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Furthermore, these agents were effective inhibitors of ADAMTS4 truncation and activation in the human chondrosarcoma cell system (15Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). When taken together, these results suggest that the control of ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1) activity in many cell-dependent systems is controlled by activation through a TIMP-1-inhibitable, GPI-anchored MMP. In the present report, we provide data that indicate that MT4-MMP (MMP-17) (12Puente X.S. Pendas A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar) is the proteinase responsible for ADAMTS4 activation and that moreover, the activated enzyme form can be bound to the cell surface through the glycosaminoglycan chains of membrane-associated syndecan-1.

Briefly, stably transfected cells (about 1 × 106 cells) were cultured in 60-mm dishes in 3 ml of standard growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum to ∼80% confluence. The day before co-transfection, the cells were replated into fresh growth medium, and the following day, the cells were transferred to serum-free medium and exposed for 3 h to expression plasmids in GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After removal of the reagent, the cells were maintained for an additional 48 h in growth medium containing 10% FBS.

For MMP immunodepletion experiments, 500 μl of ECM sample (15Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) was concentrated to 50 μl by lyophilization and added to 8 μl of anti-MMP2 or 8 μl of anti-MT4-MMP serum. Controls were run in parallel with non-immune rabbit serum. After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, 15 μl of protein A/G agarose suspension was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h on a rocker. Protein A/G was pelleted by brief centrifugation, the supernatants were removed, and 50% was used for gelatin zymography under non-reducing conditions on 8% SDS-PAGE gels prepared to include 0.1% (w/v) gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were washed twice for 15 min with 2.5% Triton X-100 in water, rinsed with water, and added to activating buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 16 h with rocking. After removal of buffer, the gels were stained for 30 min with Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.1% (w/v) in 50% (v/v) methanol, 1% (v/v) acetic acid) and destained in 40% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid. Co-immunoprecipitation Protocols—For immunoprecipitation experiments, JJ012-TS4 cells were cotransfected with MT4-MMP and after 3 days of serum-free culture were removed from the dish in cold PBS by gentle pipetting and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells (∼106) were treated with PIPLC and/or Chase/heparitinase II or directly lysed, and 200 μl of supernatant from enzyme-treated cells or 200 μl of cell lysate was pre-cleared with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-agarose. Then the supernatant was mixed with 15 μl of primary antibody (0.25–1 μg) overnight at 4 °C. The antigen/antibody complexes were precipitated by incubating with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, and after brief centrifugation, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, resuspended in gel loading buffer, and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Finally, the beads were pelleted, and the supernatants were taken for Western analysis (15Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Treatment of Cells and Immunoprecipitates with Glycosaminoglycan Lyases and Analysis of HS and CS—Replicate cultures of JJ012-TS4 cells were co-transfected with MT4-MMP and switched to serum-free medium for 3 days as above. Cells (106 per treatment) were recovered from dishes by gentle agitation and pelleted for digestion with PIPLC (see above). Cells were pelleted, washed, and then digested by Chase ABC (proteinase-free) (0.16 unit/ml in DMEM medium, 50 mm sodium acetate, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) alone, heparitinase II (2.5 units/ml in DMEM medium and 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) alone, or the enzymes sequentially, in which case the cells after Chase ABC digestion were pelleted, washed, and then digested by heparitinase II as above. After each treatment (30 min at 37 °C), cells and supernatants were separated by brief centrifugation. In experiments where syndecan-1 was immunoprecipitated in the proteoglycan form, the protein A/G agarose beads were treated with Chase ABC and heparitinase II sequentially as described above, except that the enzyme digestions were for 2 h each, and after the Chase digestion, the CaCl2 concentration was adjusted to 20 mm before addition of the heparitinase II. The total sample was then added to an equal volume of 2× gel loading buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Finally, the beads were pelleted, and the supernatants were taken for Western analysis. FACE Analysis—Cell layers were digested with proteinase K, and the solubilized glycosaminoglycan (GAG) was desalted by G50 chromatography and concentrated by lyophilization as described (21Plaas A.H. West L.A. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These were digested with either chondroitinase ABC or heparitinase II (in 100 μl of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.3). Buffer salts were removed by Speedvac lyophilization. Chondroitinase products were fluorotagged at 37 °C for 18h with 5 μl of 0.1 m 2-aminoacridone (dissolved in glacial acetic acid:Me2SO, 3:17, v/v) plus 5 μl of 1 m sodium cyanoborohydride. Heparitinase products were reacted with 0.1 m 2-aminoacridone (dissolved in glacial acetic acid:Me2SO, 3:197, v/v) plus 5 μl of 1 m sodium cyanoborohydride (21Plaas A.H. West L.A. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 25% (v/v) glycerol; samples were mixed and stored at –20 °C until electrophoretic separation on 20% polyacrylamide gels, which were prepared as follows. Cassettes were assembled in a plastic pouch using two 10 × 10-cm glass plates (Owl Separation Systems) separated by 0.8-mm spacers and then placed into a vertical protein gel caster (Fisher Scientific). Each cassette was filled to a height of ∼7 cm with degassed separating gel solution (20% acrylamide, N-methyl-bisacrylamide (38.5:1.5), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m Tris, 0.09 m boric acid, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.3), 0.25% (w/v) ammonium persulfate, and 0.5% TEMED) and then overlaid with water. After polymerization (5–10 min at room temperature), the water was discarded, and the cassette was filled with 2 ml of the degassed stacking gel solution (8% acrylamide, N-methylbisacrylamide (38.5:1.5), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m Tris borate (pH 8.3), 0.25% (w/v) ammonium persulfate, and 0.5% (v/v) TEMED), and an 8-well comb was inserted during polymerization. Before electrophoresis, gels were removed from the storage pouch, plates were washed with water, and combs were released from the stacking gel. The resulting sample wells were rinsed and then filled with electrophoresis buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.09 m boric acid, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3), and cassettes were placed in the Glyco electrophoresis gel tank (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA) filled with pre-cooled electrophoresis buffer. Aliquots (5 μl) of the fluorotagged samples were loaded, and products were separated by electrophoresis at 500 V (∼40 mA/gel) for 80 min at 4 °C. For image analyses, glass plates were removed, and the gels were placed directly onto a UV light box. Images were captured and recorded, and fluorescent bands were quantitated using the Kodak EDAS Imaging System and corresponding software. Generation of the Inactive Mutant (E362Q) of ADAMTS-4 —Full-length ADAMTS-4 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR strategy based upon the published sequence (22Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A. Yang F. Duke J.L. Solomon K. George H. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Ellis D.M. Ross H.

Briefly, total RNA (1 μg) was isolated from human primary synoviocytes and used for cDNA synthesis with SMART kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The full-length ADAMTS4 cDNA was amplified from the synoviocyte cDNA by PCR using primers designed to engineer a NotI site (5′-GCGGCCGC-3′) at the 5′-end and a XbaI site (5′-AGATCT-3′) at the 3′-end of the gene for the convenience of subcloning it into the pcDNA 3.1(+) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The primers were designed to engineer a NotI site (5′-GCGGCCGC-3′) at the 5′-end and an EcoRV site (5′-GATATC-3′) at the 3′-end of the gene for the convenience of subcloning it into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1(-) (Invitrogen, San Diego). The pairs of primers for amplifying ADAMTS-4 were 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTCAATCCTGCAAGCAAGTG-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCGCAAGGTCACCACTGTCAC-3′). The cycling conditions for PCR reactions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR products were digested and ligated into NotI/EcoRV-digested pcDNA3.1(-) vector. The sequence of the construct was verified by DNA sequence analysis and restriction enzyme digestion. The primer (C CAG TCA GCC TTC ACT GCT GCT CAT CAA(Q362) CTG GGT CAT GTC TTC A) used for site-directed mutagenesis was synthesized and purified by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA) and contained a single point mutation (G→C), which led to the amino acid change at residue 362 (E→Q) located within the catalytic domain of ADAMTS4. In addition, the pcDNA3.1(+) expression plasmid containing the wild-type ADAMTS4 was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant construct containing the desired single mutation was generated using the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and clones were sequenced for verification. C-terminal Truncation of ADAMTS-4 in Cell Culture Is Not Autoproteolytic but the Same Products Can Be Generated by Autoproteolysis—Structural details of the molecular forms of ADAMTS-4, the epitope locations, and the proposed cell surface complexes described in this report are provided in a schematic (see Fig. 12). Because the C-terminal truncation and activation of ADAMTS4 in the JJ012 cell system was completely blocked by 125 nm TIMP-1 (15Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and because ADAMTS4 is not inhibited by TIMP-1 at these concentrations (23Westling J. Fosang A.J. Last K. Thompson V.P. Tomkinson K.N. Hebert T. McDonagh T. Collins-Racie L.A. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. Sandy J.D. J. Biol.

However, it was shown recently (20Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42775-42780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that a very similar C-terminal truncation process occurs on autoproteolytic digestion of recombinant ADAMTS4, and that this also results in marked increases in the aggrecanase activity of the recombinant enzyme (24Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. Orthop. Res. Soc. 2003; 28: 157Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the relationship between the truncated forms generated in the JJ012 cell culture and by autoproteolysis, we prepared neo-epitope antibodies (JSCFRK and JSCALT) (see Fig. 12) to the C-terminals of the autoproteolytic forms (20Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J. Biol.

In keeping with previous reports (20Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J.

The autoproteolyzed sample (rTS4 auto) contained all three forms (left panel), and again, as expected, the p53 form was detected with JSCFRK (center panel), and the p40 form was detected with JSCALT only (right panel). The cell culture products (JJ012) migrated in the same positions as the autoproteolytic forms (left panel), and the species migrating at the p53 and p40 positions reacted with the JSCFRK (middle panel) and JSCALT (right panel) antibodies, respectively. It is clear that the neo-epitope antibody to the p53 form (middle panel) cross-reacts with the p40 form but not the p68 form, whereas the antibody to the p40 form (right panel) appears to be highly specific for that species. These data are consistent with the idea that the products generated by JJ012 cell-dependent proteolysis (JJ012, Fig. 1) result largely, if not entirely, from cleavage at the same sites (Lys694-Phe695 for p53 and Thr581-Phe582 for p40), as are cleaved autoproteolytically. We will therefore adopt the p68, p53, and p40 notation (20Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N.

https://openalex.org/W2019342767,"Vertebrate skeletal muscles comprise distinct fiber types that differ in their morphology, contractile function, mitochondrial content and metabolic properties. Recent studies identified the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha as a key mediator of the physiological stimuli that modulate fiber-type plasticity in postembryonic development. Although myoblasts become fated to differentiate into distinct kinds of fibers early in development, the identities of regulatory proteins that determine embryonic fiber-type specification are still obscure. Here we show that the gene u-boot (ubo), a mutation in which disrupts the induction of embryonic slow-twitch fibers, encodes the zebrafish homolog of Blimp-1, a SET domain-containing transcription factor that promotes the terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes in mammals. Expression of ubo is induced by Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in prospective slow muscle precursors, and its activity alone is sufficient to direct slow-twitch fiber-specific development by naive myoblasts. Our data provide the first molecular insight into the mechanism by which a specific group of muscle precursors is driven along a distinct pathway of fiber-type differentiation in response to positional cues in the vertebrate embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1985645808,"Control of growth determines the size and shape of organs. Localized signals known as 'organizers' and members of the Pax family of proto-oncogenes are both elements in this control. Pax proteins have a conserved DNA-binding paired domain, which is presumed to be essential for their oncogenic activity. We present evidence that the organizing signal Notch does not promote growth in eyes of D. melanogaster through either Eyeless (Ey) or Twin of eyeless (Toy), the two Pax6 transcription factors. Instead, it acts through Eyegone (Eyg), which has a truncated paired domain, consisting of only the C-terminal subregion. In humans and mice, the sole PAX6 gene produces the isoform PAX6(5a) by alternative splicing; like Eyegone, this isoform binds DNA though the C terminus of the paired domain. Overexpression of human PAX6(5a) induces strong overgrowth in vivo, whereas the canonical PAX6 variant hardly effects growth. These results show that growth and eye specification are subject to independent control and explain hyperplasia in a new way."
https://openalex.org/W1980681058,"Replication protein A (RPA) is a highly conserved single-stranded DNA–binding protein involved in DNA replication, recombination and repair. We show here that RPA is present at the telomeres of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with a maximal association in S phase. A truncation of the N-terminal region of Rfa2p (associated with the rfa2Δ40 mutated allele) results in severe telomere shortening caused by a defect in the in vivo regulation of telomerase activity. Cells carrying rfa2Δ40 show impaired binding of the protein Est1p, which is required for telomerase action. In addition, normal telomere length can be restored by expressing a Cdc13-Est1p hybrid protein. These findings indicate that RPA activates telomerase by loading Est1p onto telomeres during S phase. We propose a model of in vivo telomerase action that involves synergistic action of RPA and Cdc13p at the G-rich 3′ overhang of telomeric DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1985482733,"The generation of functional novelty in proteins encoded by a gene superfamily is seldom well documented. In this report, we define the A-conotoxin superfamily, which is widely expressed in venoms of the predatory cone snails (Conus), and show how gene products that diverge considerably in structure and function have arisen within the same superfamily. A cDNA clone encoding α-conotoxin GI, the first conotoxin characterized, provided initial data that identified the A-superfamily. Conotoxin precursors in the A-superfamily were identified from six Conus species: most (11/16) encoded α-conotoxins, but some (5/16) belong to a family of excitatory peptides, the κA-conotoxins that target voltage-gated ion channels. α-Conotoxins are two-disulfide-bridged nicotinic antagonists, 13–19 amino acids in length; κA-conotoxins are larger (31–36 amino acids) with three disulfide bridges. Purification and biochemical characterization of one peptide, κA-conotoxin MIVA is reported; five of the other predicted conotoxins were previously venom-purified. A comparative analysis of conotoxins purified from venom, and their precursors reveal novel post-translational processing, as well as mutational events leading to polymorphism.

Patterns of sequence divergence and Cys codon usage define the major superfamily branches and suggest how these separate branches arose. The predatory cone snails use their biochemically and pharmacologically complex venoms to capture prey, defend against predators, and compete with other animals in their environment (1Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 2002; 33: 25-42Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The active components of these venoms are mostly small, disulfide-rich peptides, 10–30 amino acids in length (“conotoxins”) (2Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Clark C. Ramilo C.A. Corpuz G.P. Abogadie F.C. Mena E.E. Woodward S.R. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. Science. 1990; 249: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). As a group, cone snails (genus Conus) are very successful (>500 species), arguably the largest single genus of marine invertebrates (3Kohn A.J. Perron F.E. Life History and Biogeography Patterns in Conus. Clarendon Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). During speciation, a remarkable hypermutation of Conus venom peptides occurs (4Woodward S.R. Cruz L.J.

The entire spectrum of 50–200 peptides that comprises the conotoxin repertoire of a particular Conus species is distinct from the peptide complement of the venom of any other Conus species. Thus, it is estimated that a total of >50,000 different peptides can potentially be expressed in the venoms of living Conus. A simplifying conceptual framework for addressing the formidable molecular complexity of the conotoxins is that the 50,000 peptides are encoded by relatively few gene superfamilies, which have greatly diversified within this genus. In general, each conotoxin superfamily has distinctive and conserved sequence features in the conotoxin precursors encoded by the gene superfamily. Several superfamilies have been characterized, including the O-, T-, P-, I-, and M-superfamilies that have between two and five disulfide cross-links (4Woodward S.R. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M.

The mature conotoxins in each conotoxin superfamily have a characteristic arrangement of cysteine residues, the oxidative folding of which results in a three-dimensional scaffold with a specific disulfide connectivity (“the Cys framework”). The conserved Cys superfamily framework largely determines the three-dimensional conformation of the polypeptide backbone of all peptides that belong to the superfamily. The very first toxin purified and characterized from a Conus venom was α-conotoxin GI, a competitive nicotinic antagonist from the venom of the geography cone, Conus geographus (10Gray W.R. Luque A. Olivera B.M. Barrett J. Cruz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4734-4740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-GI was shown to be a 13-amino acid peptide with two disulfide cross-links. The biochemical studies on α-GI established for the first time that the biologically active constituents of Conus venoms were small, multiply cross-linked peptides, generically referred to as conotoxins. Although several conotoxin superfamilies have been described, the gene superfamily to which α-conotoxin GI belongs has not been previously defined in the literature. We show that the A-conotoxin gene superfamily, to which α-conotoxin GI belongs, is found in fish-hunting, snail-hunting, and worm-hunting species of Conus and has undergone both structural and functional diversification. Isolation and Sequencing of cDNA Clones of α-Conotoxin GI—cDNA clones encoding α-conotoxin GI were isolated from a size-fractionated cDNA library previously constructed by J. Hunspurger from Conus geographus duct mRNA using pUC13 as cloning vector and Escherichia coli strain MC1061F′laclq as the host cell. Clones were identified by screening them with a mixed oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the first six amino acids of GI (5′-GCXGGRTTRCARCAYTC-3′, where R = AorG, Y = CorT,and X = AGT or C). The probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning.

After washing twice in 3 m TMAC/50 mm Tris/0.2% SDS and two times in 2× standard saline citrate/0.1% SDS, positive colonies were identified by autoradiography. Some clones gave the sequence of α-GIB, a homologous α-conotoxin. α-GIB clones were eliminated by subtractive screening using an additional probe corresponding to the five amino acids at the C terminus of α-GI.

The sequence shown in Table I was obtained by walking through the cDNA with five primers in the forward direction and five primers in the reverse direction.Table IcDNA sequence of the gene for α-conotoxin GI and the predicted translation product The signal sequence is shaded, and the toxin region is underlined. Nucleotides in the untranslated region are in small letters, and the poly(A) addition signal (aataaa) is shaded. In α-GIB, two amino acids (KG) corresponding to an insertion of six nucleotides (AAG GGA) are in the position marked by a dash (—) in the above sequence of α-GI. Open table in a new tab Cloning and Sequencing of A-superfamily Peptides from Several Conus Species—The cDNAs were prepared from cDNA libraries of Conus striatus and C. magus, and the poly(A)+ mRNA obtained from the venom ducts of C. striatus, C. stercusmuscarum, C. bandanus, and C. caracteristicus; mRNA was from the venom ducts of several snails in each case. The cDNA libraries were prepared using either the protocol in Sambrook (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or the Promega Magic Miniprep system. cDNAs were amplified using a pair of primers, one corresponding to the signal sequence and the other to the 3′-untranslated region near the open reading frame. Amplification with Vent polymerase was done for 30 cycles using an air thermocycler set as follows: denaturation at 94 °C, 0 s; annealing at 50 °C, 0 s; elongation at 72 °C, 15 s. Ten-microliter aliquots of PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel in Tris-acetate buffer with ethidium bromide, and the remaining products were purified by gel electrophoresis in a 1.5% low melting gel. The plasmid vector used for cloning was a modified pDH52, which we named pDH78. pDH52 is basically pGEM 3Zf+ (Promega) with its polylinker region extended by cloning into the EcoRI and KpnI sites a synthetic oligomer encoding sites for EcoRI, Sacl, EcoRV, NotI, SphI, NsiI, StuI, BgIII, and KpnI. This was further modified by adding a 23-mer synthetic DNA fragment that has a KpnI site inserted into the XbaI and BglII sites to generate pDH78. Plasmid DNA digested with KpnI and the PCR-amplified products were treated with 2 units of T4 DNA polymerase per milligram of DNA in the presence of 0.5 mm dATP for the vector and 0.5 mm dTTP for the PCR product in a 10- to 20-μl solution of 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, then heated for 10 min at 70–75 °C to stop the reaction. For ligation, a mixture of DNA polymerase-treated vector (0.1 μg) and PCR product (0.05 μg) was preincubated at 45 °C for 5 min before 5 nmol of ATP and 7–20 units of ligase were added, and the mixture was incubated at 16 °C for 16 h. Transformants were tested for the presence of the desired recombinant plasmids by digestion of the purified plasmid with XbaI and BglII, by PCR of the purified plasmid and/or by PCR of the colony after lysis. Solid phase sequencing (12Hultman T. Stahl S. Homes E. Uhlen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4937-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) was done using magnetic beads from Dynal and the USB DNA sequencing kit. Purification of κA-conotoxin MIVA—Freeze-dried Conus magus venom (500 mg) was extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and filtered through Centriprep 30 microconcentrators as previously described by Cartier et al. (14Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The extract was fractionated on a semi-preparative Vydac C18 column equipped with a guard module. All other chromatographic purifications involved an analytical Brownlee C8 column (4.6 mm × 22 cm, RP300 packing, 7-mm particle size, 300-Å pore size) with a guard cartridge that also had RP300 packing material. For all chromatograms, buffer A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and buffer B was 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The activity of fractions was monitored by measuring synaptically evoked responses from cutaneous pectoris muscle of frog as previously described (15Yoshikami D. Bagabaldo Z. Olivera B.M. Ann. N. Y.

Pyridylethylation, Chymotrypsin Digestion, and Sequencing of MIVA—The peptide was pyridylethylated prior to sequencing. An aliquot of HPLC fraction containing 1 nmol of MIVA was concentrated down to 5 μl of MIVA and taken up in 50 μl of 0.25 m Tris/2 mm EDTA/6 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.7, mixed with 2 μl of 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Two microliters of 20% 4-vinylpyridine in ethanol was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. 25 μl of 2% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) was added prior to HPLC on an analytical Brownlee C8 column (RP300, 220 × 4.6 mm), which was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% HFBA. The pyridylethylated peptide, concentrated to ∼5 μl, was mixed with 2.5 μl of acetonitrile before addition of the digestion buffer (0.25 m Tris/10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8) and 2 μl of 0.05 μg/μl chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science). The reaction mix was incubated overnight at room temperature, 25 μl of 2% HFBA was added before separation of the fragments by HPLC as described above for the pyridylethylated peptide. Sequencing of the alkylated peptide and the chymotrypsin fragments was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer at the Protein/DNA Core Facility at the University of Utah Cancer Center. Identification and Analysis of a cDNA Clone Encoding α-Conotoxin GI—A cDNA sequence of the α-conotoxin GI prepropeptide matched the canonical organization originally established for conotoxin gene superfamilies by Hillyard and coworkers (4Woodward S.R. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. EMBO J. 1990; 1: 1015-1020Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar); the literature on conotoxin superfamilies was recently reviewed (1Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 2002; 33: 25-42Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The messenger RNA encoding α-conotoxin GI has the characteristic four-module organization, including a signal sequence, a “pro” region, the toxin-encoding region followed by a stop codon, and a 3′-untranslated region. For the α-conotoxin GI cDNA, the signal sequence is 21 amino acids, the pro region is 28 aa and the C-terminal toxin region comprises 15 amino acids that are predicted to be post-translationally processed to the 13-amino acid toxin. For α-conotoxin GI, the 3′-untranslated region is quite long: 823 nucleotides (Fig. 1). The generation of the mature toxin requires proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal prepro region of the precursor, and standard processing at the C terminus from the sequence -CGR- to -C-NH2. A closely related cDNA sequence was also found, which appears to be a polymorphism in the α-conotoxin GI gene. The nucleotide sequence is identical except for an insertion of six nucleotides, as shown in Table I, where the relevant α-GI sequence and the cDNA encoding the variant (designated here as α-conotoxin GIB) are shown. The insertion of the six nucleotides would lead to a mature toxin predicted to have two extra amino acids at the C terminus. Given the sequence identity between them, α-GI and α-GIB may be allelic variants. Characterization of Related cDNA Clones from Another Fish-hunting Species, C. striatus—To compare related genes from another Conus species, we characterized cDNA clones from the venom duct of the striated cone, C. striatus, a fish-hunting species (see Fig. 1). This venom has been extensively characterized (18Zafaralla G.C. Ramilo C. Gray W.R. Karlstrom R. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7102-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and several α-conotoxins were previously purified from the venom of this species. cDNA clones were analyzed from a C. striatus venom duct cDNA library as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Five distinct sequences were obtained, which are compared with α-conotoxin GI in Table II. As expected, two of these sequences encode α-conotoxins previously characterized from C. striatus venom. These are α-conotoxin SI and α-conotoxin SII. The latter is an unusual peptide closely related in sequence to other α-conotoxins, but with an additional disulfide bond. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the three predicted open reading frames (for α-conotoxins GI, SI, and SII) reveals that the signal sequence regions are identical. In general, sequence divergence increases from the N to C terminus of the open reading frame; in the signal sequence, there is at most a single amino acid that differs from the 21 aa consensus with greater divergence in the pro region, and considerable hypervariability at the C-terminal toxin-encoding region. There are clearly three groups of toxin sequences based on sequence similarity: the first four sequences (α-conotoxins GI, GIB, SI, and SII) show much greater sequence homology to each other than to the other two groups in Table II (S1.1 and SIVA/SIVB). The degree of sequence divergence is reflected in the biological properties of the peptides (see “Discussion”).Table IIComparison of conotoxin prepropeptide sequences Signal sequences are shaded, and the toxin regions are underlined. In A, the shaded sections of the cDNA sequences mark the 25-nucleotide alteration that explains the difference in length of κA-SIVA and κA-SIVB, and the 6-nucleotide change at the carboxyl terminus of SI to generate a longer conotoxin (SII). The sequence of α-conotoxin GI from C. geographus is given for comparison. Open table in a new tab In addition to the α-conotoxin SI- and SII-encoding cDNA clones, the S1.1 clone from C. striatus encoded the precursor of an α-conotoxin-like peptide. Although the predicted mature peptide has the characteristic Cys pattern of the α-conotoxins (–CC–C–C–), it is very divergent in amino acid sequence from α-conotoxins GI, SI, and SII (which share considerable sequence homology). The predicted mature peptide has not been purified from venom. A surprise from the analysis of the C. striatus cDNA was a class of clones that exhibited substantial sequence identity to those above but did not encode α-conotoxin precursors; instead, these encode two κA-conotoxins. One of the predicted mature conotoxins, κA-conotoxin SIVA, was previously characterized from venom (17Craig A.G. Zafaralla G. Cruz L.J. Santos A.D. Hillyard D.R. Dykert J. Rivier J.E. Gray W.R. Imperial J. DelaCruz R.G. Sporning A. Terlau H. West P.J. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16019-16025Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The two such sequences obtained originated from two different collection samples: the clones encoding κA-SIVA were obtained from a cDNA library made from snails collected in the Philippines. A second set of closely related clones, encoding a peptide designated as κA-SIVB was obtained from cDNA made from specimens of C. striatus collected in the Hawaiian Islands. As shown in Table II, the N-terminal sequences of these clones have considerable sequence identity to the clones that encode the α-conotoxins: the seven signal sequences (α-conotoxins GI, GIB, SI, and SII and κA-conotoxins SIVA, SIVB, and S1.1) were found to be virtually identical (see shaded amino acid sequences in Table IIA). However, in the propeptide region there is more divergence between the clones that encode α-conotoxins versus those that encode κA-conotoxins (see “Discussion”), and, in the encoded mature toxins (underlined sequences), there is essentially no homology detectable between the α-conotoxins and κA-conotoxins. The two clones encoding κA-conotoxins are largely identical in the predicted amino acid sequence for the first 68 amino acids of the open reading frame (only 2 aa substitutions). However, the mature toxin region of κA-SIVA comprises 31 aa, whereas for κA-SIVB it is 42 aa. Thus, the SIVA precursor is a total of 69 aa versus the SIVB precursor, which is 80 aa. The C-terminal amino acid of SIVA is predicted to be a glycine followed by a stop codon. As shown in Table IIA, there is no stop codon at the homologous position in SIVB, resulting in an additional 11 amino acids at the C-terminal end. An examination of the nucleotide sequence in this region, shown in Table II, indicates that the conversion from SIVA to SIVB is not explained by a simple substitution, insertion, or deletion; instead, there is a substitution of a block of 25 nucleotides (shaded nucleotide sequences in Table IIA). At the 3′-end of the open reading frame of SIVB, the sequences become identical once again. The discovery of the considerable extent of sequence identity between the α-conotoxin and κA-conotoxin precursors is unprecedented. The arrangement of Cys residues in the mature toxins are completely different for the two groups; furthermore, the κA-conotoxins are excitatory peptides targeted to voltage-gated ion channels and not nicotinic receptor antagonists, the physiological mechanism underlying the activity of α-conotoxins (19McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, although the two groups of peptides are genetically related (with considerable identity in signal sequences and the N-terminal side of their propeptide regions) and belong to the same gene superfamily, they have clearly diverged to yield two families of conotoxins that are both structurally and functionally distinct. Analysis of cDNA Clones from Other Fish-hunting Conus Species—To explore which members of the A-conotoxin superfamily are highly expressed in other fish-hunting species, we investigated C. magus, the magician's cone, and Conus stercusmuscarum, the fly-speck cone (see Fig. 1). The results of the analysis are shown in Table IIB. From C. magus, one open reading frame encoding a precursor sequence for an α-conotoxin was identified; surprisingly, all of these encoded an α-conotoxin MII precursor. α-Conotoxin MII has been extensively characterized (14Cartier G.E.

Instead, α-MII potently blocks two neuronal nicotinic receptor subtypes, α3β2 and α6β3β2 (14Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol.

The second A-superfamily sequence from C. magus encoded a peptide that had high sequence homology to κA-conotoxin SIVA, which we are designating κA-conotoxin MIVA. As will be described below, we have directly characterized κA-conotoxin MIVA from C. magus venom. The C. stercusmuscarum cDNA library did not yield any α-conotoxin precursors; all of the clones analyzed had open reading frames that encoded precursors of peptides homologous to κA-conotoxins SIVA and MIVA (designated κA-conotoxins SmIVA and SmIVB). These share considerable sequence identity and are likely to be allelic variants. The predicted open reading frames are shown in Table IIB. Analysis of the A-superfamily in Non-piscivorous Conus Species—To compare the A-superfamily in Conus species that do not prey on fish to the A-superfamily conotoxins expressed in the fish-hunting Conus species investigated above, we identified A-superfamily members from cDNA libraries from a molluscivorous (snail-hunting) species, Conus bandanus, and from a vermivorous (worm-hunting) species, Conus caracteristicus (see Fig. 1). Using the nomenclature of Espiritu et al. (23Espiritu D.J.D. Watkins M. Dia-Monje V. Cartier G.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1899-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), all of the fish-hunting species analyzed belong to either Clades I or II, whereas C. bandanus belongs to the mollusc-hunting Clade VI, and C. caracteristicus belongs to the worm-hunting Clade XIV. The analysis of cDNA clones yielded three different types of sequences for C. bandanus and two for C. caracteristicus (see Table IIC). It is noteworthy that all five sequences elucidated from these species are predicted to encode α-conotoxins; however, none of the clones analyzed encoded a three-disulfide-cross-linked-containing Conus peptide (such as κA-conotoxin SIVA). Thus, in contrast to such species as C. striatus, C. magus, and C. stercusmuscarum, the non-piscivorous species we have analyzed are notable in encoding only α-conotoxin-like sequences. None of the C. caracteristicus or C. bandanus peptides have been purified from venom. However, one of the C. bandanus peptides, encoded by clone Bn1.3, was chemically synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures” and tested on six different cloned rat nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes expressed in Xenopus oocytes by previously described methods (14Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) (α2β2, α2β4, α3β4, α4β2, α4β4, and α6/α3β2β3). The peptide did not detectably affect any of the nicotinic receptor subtypes tested (IC50 > 5 μm for all subtypes). The lack of activity may be due to high specificity of the peptide for a molluscan target, although the possibility that a post-translational modification in the native peptide is required for activity is an alternative explanation (see next section). Isolation and Characterization of κA-conotoxin MIVA—A highly potent excitatory peptide that elicits repetitive action potentials and causes the same spastic symptomatology as κA-conotoxin SIVA was purified from C. magus venom (Fig. 2). As shown in Table III, initial sequencing of the pyridylethylated peptide gave a 36-amino acid peptide with a faint Glu signal in position 3 and blanks in positions 7 and 9. The sequence is otherwise identical to that predicted from a cDNA clone from C. magus (underlined sequence in Table IIB), indicating that positions 7 and 9 are modified Thr residues.Table IIISequencing and mass spectrometry of κ-A-conotoxin MIVASequenceAverage massPredictedObservedDifferenceDaSequence predicted from cDNA cloneaThe predicted sequence assumes that PGRRND is post-translationally modified to P-NH2APELVVTATTNCCGYNPMTICPPCMCTYSCPPKRKP-NH24041.75095.31053.6Sequence of alkylated peptideAOγLVV-A-TNCCGYNOMTICOOCMCTYSCOOKRKOChymotrypsin fragment#1AOELVV-A-TNCCGY1769.0bEstimated assuming that residue 3 is γ-carboxyglutamate in fragment #1a, and residues 7 and 9 are threonines2822.31053.3#1aAO-LVV-A-TNCCGY1813.1bEstimated assuming that residue 3 is γ-carboxyglutamate in fragment #1a, and residues 7 and 9 are threonines2866.01053.0#2TICOOCMCTY1479.81479.2#3SCOOKRKO1064.61064.6Sequence of κA-conotoxin MIVAcThe putative glycosylated threonine residues are underlined.

In eukaryotic cells the structure of chromatin has been shown to repress gene activation, and both remodeling and repositioning of nucleosomes are necessary to allow binding of transcription factors and the formation of the transcriptional preinitiation complex (1Horn P.J.

PPARγ has mostly been studied because of its key role in adipocyte differentiation, where it acts as a master controller of the “thrifty gene response” (16Auwerx J. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1033-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 17Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), but it has many additional functions (18Debril M.B. Renaud J.P. Fajas L. Auwerx J. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 30-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). PPARγ heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and is activated by naturally occurring fatty acids or fatty acid derivatives (19Schoonjans K. Martin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In addition to these natural PPARγ ligands, several classes of synthetic PPARγ agonists have been described including the thiazolidinediones, which are potent insulin sensitizers used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (20Schoonjans K. Auwerx J. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1008-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 21Willson T.M. Lambert M.H. Kliewer S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). To activate transcription, PPARs, like most transcription factors, rely on coregulators that modify chromatin (22Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 23Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Coregulators partially determine the specificity of action of nuclear receptors and integrate their different activities to orchestrate a specific cellular response. It has long been known that the SWI/SNF complex can cooperate with nuclear receptors to modulate transcription (24Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R.

We characterized here a new coregulator isolated from adipose tissue using a yeast two-hybrid screen with the ligand binding domain of PPARγ as bait. This regulator represents a novel isoform of BAF60c (BRG1-associated factor of 60 kDa, subunit c) that we named BAF60c2. BAF60c2 as well as the previously identified protein, renamed BAF60c1, is part of a protein complex with BRG1 and is broadly expressed in the cell nucleus where it binds to multiple nuclear receptors in a ligand-independent manner and enhances its transcriptional activity. BAF60c1 and -c2 also bind to various other (but not all) transcription factors. BAF60c does not seem to affect adipocyte differentiation and cell proliferation.

RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription-PCR, and Quantitative PCR Oligonucleotides—RNA was isolated from cell lines, murine tissues, and human adipose tissue by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (45Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). RNAs from other human tissues were purchased at Clontech (human total RNA master panel II). Reverse transcription of RNA was performed as described (46Fayard E. Schoonjans K. Annicotte J.S. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

Quantitative (Q) real-time PCRs were performed using a LightCycler and the DNA double-strand specific SYBR Green I dye for detection (Roche Applied Science). Construction of the Yeast Two-hybrid Library and Screening—Adipose tissue was obtained from a female non-obese adult subject undergoing endoscopic cholecystectomy after informed consent was obtained. The local ethics committee of the CHU in Lille approved the project. cDNA library preparation, library screening, and prey construct purification were done according to the manufacturer (Stratagene). To create the “bait” vector the DE domains of PPARγ2 (residues 179-505) were cloned downstream of the DNA binding domain of Gal4. YRG-2 yeast (Stratagene) were sequentially transformed with the bait construct and with the library and grown on the appropriate selective medium in the presence of the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone (1 μm). In Situ Hybridization Experiments—CD1 embryos from 11.5 to 16.5 days post coitum and C57B6 adult brains were directly embedded in cryomatrix (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). In situ hybridization were performed as described (47Dolle P. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A portion of mouse BAF60c cDNA in pBS was linearized by XhoI and EcoRI. Antisense mBAF60c mRNA was synthesized using T7 polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). A sense RNA probe for mBAF60c (synthesized using T3 polymerase) was used as negative control (data not shown). Cell Culture, Transfections, Adipocyte Differentiation, Retroviral Infection, RNA interference (RNAi)—Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 according to the supplier's instructions (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in 6- or 24-well plates. Empty expression vectors were used to maintain equivalent amounts of DNA in the transfections. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described (44Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Graphs represent the means of three independent experiments in which each point was performed in triplicate. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes and oil-red-O were performed as described (48Fajas L. Egler V. Reiter R. Hansen J. Kristiansen K. Debril M.B. Miard S. Auwerx J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 903-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) Retroviral infection of 3T3-L1 or NIH3T3 cells was performed as described (49Brendel C. Gelman L. Auwerx J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant retroviral vectors pLP-LNCX, pLP-LNCX-hBAF60c1, and pLP-LNCX-hBAF60c2 were transiently transfected in 293 cells stably expressing Moloney gag and pol (293gp). Viral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and added on 3T3-L1 or NIH3T3 cells for 5 h in the presence of Polybrene (4 μg/ml). 48 h after infection cells were selected with neomycin. The RNAi experiment was performed using the pSUPER RNAi system™ (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). Briefly, a double stranded oligonucleotide targeting nucleotides 1388-1406 (5′-gATCCCCggTgATgACAgATgTggCATTCAAgAgATgCCACATCTgTCATCACCTTTTTggAAA-3′) of mBAF60c mRNA was cloned in the BglII/HindIII site of the pSUPER vector. Stable transfection was carried out on 3T3-L1 or NIH3T3 cells using 6 μg of the empty pSUPER or BAF60c RNAi vector, 0.6 μg of pPur vector, and LipofectAMINE. Puromycin (1 μg/ml) was then added in the medium for selection. Protein Production, Pull-down Assays, Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation—For glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, deletion mutants of BAF60c2 (BAF60c2Nt, aa 1-194; BAF60c2Ct, aa 296-484), p300 (p300Nt, aa 2-516), and PPARγ (PPARγbAB, aa 1-129; PPARγDE, aa 204-507, is a gift from G. Zhou, Merck) and full-length BAF60c1 and BAF60c2 were subcloned downstream of the GST cDNA in the pGex-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). pGex-2T-mRXRα was a gift from P. Chambon. The GST fusion proteins were prepared as described (44Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Pull-down assays were performed with in vitro35S-radiolabeled translated proteins (TNT Quick Rabbit Reticulocyte, Promega) or purified proteins (His-PPARγE) as described (44Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Ligand was added when indicated. Immunoblotting was performed as described (44Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts for immunoprecipitation were prepared from HeLa cells as described (50Dilworth F.J. Fromental-Ramain C. Remboutsika E. Benecke A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1995-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed with antibodies directed against various parts of BAF60c, PPARγ, or BRG1 (2SNF-2E12). Mock immunoprecipitations were performed with preimmune serum. Generation of Polyclonal Antibodies and Immunofluoresence—Peptides corresponding to aa 1-13 of hBAF60c1 (MTPGLQHPPTVVQ), 4-20 of hBAF60c2 (DEVAGGARKATKSKLFE), and 293-310 of hBAF60c2 (KTNRLQDSHDKEYINGDKY, common to both proteins) were synthesized with an additional cysteine at their extremity. These peptides were coupled to activated ovalbumin following the manufacturer's protocol (Imject® maleimide-activated ovalbumin, Pierce) and were injected into rabbits in the presence of Freund's adjuvant to obtain rabbit sera containing antibodies against hBAF60c1, hBAF60c2, or hBAF60c C-terminal part. For immunofluoresence cells were grown on cover slips and incubated with antibodies after fixation and permeabilization with methanol. Preparations were then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Cell Counting and 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation Assay—Cells (20000) were plated in 6-well plates and counted in triplicate each day for 4 days. For the BrdUrd incorporation assay cells were plated on cover slips. After 1 night cells were incubated 2 h with BrdUrd, and an immunofluoresence assay was performed using a mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). Nuclei were labeled by Hoechst staining. The percentage of cells incorporating BrdUrd was assessed by counting 5 different areas of about 100 cells. Counting was done in three independent experiments, and error bars indicate S.D. Isolation of BAF60c2 and Genomic Organization—PPARγ is highly expressed in adipose tissue, where its function has been well characterized (16Auwerx J. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1033-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). To isolate new PPARγ coregulators we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human adipose tissue cDNA library with the DE domain of PPARγ2 fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast Gal4 activator as a bait. The C-terminal DE domain of PPARγ encompasses the ligand binding domain and the ligand-dependent activation function AF-2. One of the constructs isolated in our yeast two-hybrid screen (clone 7) was a cDNA containing a 1452-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 484 residues. This cDNA was identical to the one coding for the BAF60c protein except that the 39 bp, coding for the 13 first amino acids of this protein, were replaced by 78-bp coding for 26 residues (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the isolated clone could represent an alternatively spliced form of BAF60c, we first reconstituted the genomic structure of BAF60c by comparing its cDNA sequence to human genome sequences available in databases (AC005486 and NM_003078) and identified the intron/exon boundaries in that gene (Fig. 1C). The human BAF60c gene is located on chromosome 7 (7q35-36) and comprises 13 exons and 12 introns (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal domain of clone 7 is encoded by a so far unidentified exon located between exon 1 and 2 of the previously described hBaf60c gene (10Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Hence, we renamed the exon encoding the N-terminal part of the Baf60c gene described in the literature as “exon 1A” and the newly identified exon as “exon 1B.” Sequencing of the cDNAs obtained by reverse transcription-PCR with two different primer sets confirmed the existence of two different mRNAs for BAF60c. Therefore, our yeast two-hybrid screen allowed us to isolate a splice variant of BAF60c, which we named BAF60c2, encoded by a cDNA of 2004 bp. The nucleotide sequence for the BAF60c2 gene has been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under GenBank™ accession number AY450430. The BAF60c protein previously identified (10Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) was renamed BAF60c1. Its nucleotide sequence has been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under GenBank™ accession number AY450431. The new BAF60c2 isoform has not yet been described in human or mouse. A data base search revealed, however, the existence of a mouse clone (NM_025891) whose coding sequence is highly similar to hBAF60c2 (93% identity between DNA sequences, with a 100% identity for the first 78 bp; see Fig. 1A) and which might be the mouse counterpart of hBAF60c2. The genomic sequence of mouse chromosome 5 (NW_000225), carrying the mBAF60c gene, also contains a sequence with high homology to exon 1A, but the putative exon 1A in mouse contains 4 additional bases, disrupting the reading frame. The mBAF60c1 protein can, hence, not be produced in contrast to hBAF60c1 and mBAF60c2. The mouse genomic sequence furthermore demonstrates the perfect conservation of exon 1B coding for the N terminus of mBAF60c2 as compared with hBAF60c2 exon 1B. BAF60c Is Abundantly Expressed and Enriched in the Central Nervous System—Both isoforms of BAF60c were broadly expressed, with the highest levels in brain, testis, and uterus (Fig. 1, D-E). Strikingly, hBAF60c2 is the predominant isoform in adipose tissue (from which it was cloned), skeletal muscle, lung, heart, and thyroid. hBAF60c1 showed only a higher expression than hBAF60c2 in brain, spleen, and trachea. These expression data extend and refine the expression results previously reported for BAF60c1 (10Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). We also performed in situ hybridization experiments to study the expression of BAF60c mRNA during mouse development (Fig. 2). In mouse embryos, BAF60c mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcription-PCR starting from 7 days post coitum (data not shown). In situ hybridization experiments indicated BAF60c mRNA expression in numerous organs in mouse embryos, such as brain (cortex, thalamus, cerebellum), spinal cord, muscle and heart, diaphragm, tongue, stomach epithelium, and olfactory epithelium (Fig. 2A). In adult mice (Fig. 2B) mBAF60c mRNA is highly enriched in the brain and cerebellum. In the cerebellum, which is involved in the coordination and control of motor functions, BAF60c is highly expressed in Purkinje cells and in deep cerebellar nuclei, i.e. medial, posterior interposed, and lateral (or dentate) nuclei. Purkinje cells are the principal cells of the cerebellum, which transmit their motor signals via the deep nuclei. Consistent with this, the deep nuclei have been shown to play a role in motor functions as well as sensory-motor learning and memory. BAF60c mRNA is also expressed in cerebellar pedoncule, more particularly, in the vestibular nuclei, such as spinal and medial vestibular nuclei (Fig. 2B), which are involved in equilibrium and motricity. BAF60c mRNA is broadly expressed in the primary and secondary motor cortex. Furthermore, BAF60c mRNA is localized in the hippocampus. A high expression of BAF60c mRNA is also observed in piriform cortex as well as olfactory tubercle (data not shown) and the adjacent anterior olfactory nuclei, i.e. medial and ventral (Fig. 2B). Altogether these data indicate that BAF60c could be involved in various functions in the central nervous system and, in particular, motor and olfactory activities. Cellular Localization of BAF60c—The presence of a putative nuclear localization signal in BAF60c isoforms (hatched boxes, Fig. 1A) suggested that it functions as a nuclear protein. To evaluate the intracellular localization of BAF60c2, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for GFP, GFP-hBAF60c1, or GFP-hBAF60c2 fusion proteins and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A). GFP-BAF60c1 and GFPBAF60c2 proteins were detected exclusively in the nucleus of 293T cells (middle and bottom p"

Aurora A autoactivation by autophosphorylation is promoted by specific non-catalytic binding proteins. One such protein is TPX2, a required spindle assembly factor in higher eukaryotes whose ability to activate Aurora A by direct binding to the kinase catalytic domain has been established by biochemical and structural analysis. In this report we clarify the autoactivation mechanism of Aurora A by demonstrating that of seven amino acids which become autophosphorylated by Aurora A, only Thr-295 is required for activity. Association of Aurora A with TPX2 leads to activation of the kinase, in parallel with phosphorylation of TPX2. We identify the sites as three Ser residues in the N terminus of TPX2; however, mutation of these residues does not affect Aurora A activation by TPX2. In contrast, the mutation of a putative Aurora A-binding motif in TPX2 abolishes both phosphorylation of TPX2 and activation of Aurora A. We have also investigated the interaction between Xenopus p53 and Xenopus Aurora A. p53 blocks the activity of either full-length Aurora A or the isolated catalytic domain. Interestingly, inhibition is blocked by TPX2, suggesting that the ability of Aurora A to transform cells could be regulated by p53, TPX2, or other binding proteins.

Reversible protein phosphorylation is a regulatory mechanism employed during all eukaryotic cell cycles, and several classes of protein kinase tightly regulate the essential processes of DNA replication, mitosis, and cytokinesis (1Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Metazoans contain three classes of Aurora Ser/Thr protein kinase, termed A, B, and C, and each exhibits diverse subcellular localization during the cell cycle, reflecting the discrete role of each kinase during mitosis (2Carmera M.T. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Aurora was originally described in budding yeast (3Chan C.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 677-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the fly (4Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), where it regulates centrosome separation and is required to generate spindle bipolarity, a precondition for accurate chromosome segregation. More recently, Aurora A homologs in higher eukaryotes have been shown to be critical for multiple steps in cell division, including regulation of the G2/M transition, the centrosome cycle, and spindle assembly and stability (5Andresson T.

Significantly, overexpression of either Xenopus or human Aurora A causes cell transformation, and Aurora A is overexpressed in numerous tumors, suggesting that its activity is critical in the etiology of cancer (9Bischoff J.R.

Both Aurora A and Aurora B exist in distinct multiprotein complexes that ensure correct spatial localization and activation (2Carmera M.T. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Moreover, Aurora B has been shown to regulate its own activator, INCENP, by direct phosphorylation (19Bishop J.D.

Activation of Aurora A is thought to occur by an autocatalytic phosphorylation event in which partner proteins stimulate autoactivation by inducing precise alignment of the catalytic residues located between the two clefts of the active site (17Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 691-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Bayliss R. Sardon T. Vernos I. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 4: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Recently, two putative Aurora A activators have been described, the LIM domain-containing protein Ajuba (8Hirota T. Kunitoku N. Sasayama T. Marumoto T. Zhang D. Nitta M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. Cell. 2003; 114: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and the microtubule-associated protein TPX2 (17Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Interestingly, because Thr-295 phosphorylation can be rapidly reversed by associated phosphatases, leading to inactivation, TPX2 has also evolved a second regulatory role, the protection of phosphorylated Thr-295 from catalytic attack by protein phosphatases such as PP1 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, protein phosphatase 1; BSA, bovine serum albumin.

Ruderman J. Prigent C. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A recent crystal structure has elucidated the mechanism of Aurora A activation by TPX2 at the molecular level (22Bayliss R. Sardon T. Vernos I. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 4: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (456) Google Scholar). TPX2 binding at two sites on Aurora A locks the catalytic domain of the kinase into an active configuration, generating favorable alignment of catalytic residues and unmasking the substrate-binding site. Moreover, TPX2 binding swings the domain containing phosphorylated Thr-295 into a phosphatase-inaccessible conformation by burying the labile phosphothreonine side chain (22Bayliss R. Sardon T. Vernos I. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 4: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Several putative physiological Aurora A substrates and binding proteins have been identified. These include Ajuba, TPX2, centrosomin, D-TACC, and p53 (8Hirota T. Kunitoku N. Sasayama T. Marumoto T.

In some cases the binding of Aurora A to these proteins also localizes the kinase to the correct subcellular organelle, where it presumably phosphorylates substrates required for the orderly progression of mitosis. TPX2 is one of the most efficiently phosphorylated Aurora A substrates identified to date and has been shown to be crucial for Aurora A localization to spindle microtubules (24Kufer T.A. Sillje H.H. Korner R. Gruss O.J. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). TPX2 contains multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for Cdc2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase as well as seven putative nuclear localization signals (28Wittmann T. Wilm M. Karsenti E. Vernos I. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1405-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It is required for spindle assembly in Xenopus egg extracts and in HeLa cells and for the generation of stable spindle poles (28Wittmann T. Wilm M. Karsenti E. Vernos I. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1405-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 29Garrett S. Auer K. Compton D.A. Kapoor T.M. Curr.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). During interphase TPX2 resides in the nucleus due to sequestration into complexes containing the proteins importin α and β. However, after nuclear envelope breakdown, the generation of high Ran-GTP levels adjacent to chromosomes stimulates release of TPX2 from the importins and binding to Aurora A (23Tsai M.Y. Wiese C.

Karsenti E. Mattaj I.W. Gruss O.J. Carazo-Salas R.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2060-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The subsequent molecular events driven by activated Aurora A and phosphorylated TPX2 are poorly understood. TPX2 is phosphorylated upon isolation from mitotic cell extracts (28Wittmann T. Wilm M. Karsenti E. Vernos I. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1405-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, the specific sites and relative importance of these modifications has not been explored. In this paper we investigate the regulation of Aurora A activity and identify several TPX2 phosphorylation sites. We analyze the role of this phosphorylation in TPX2-mediated Aurora A activation and also identify several mutations in the N terminus of TPX2 that uncouple Aurora A activation and TPX2 phosphorylation. The dynamic association of phosphorylated protein complexes containing Aurora A and TPX2 is likely to be important for both Aurora A and TPX2-dependent processes during the cell cycle. Recombinant Proteins—Hexahistidine-tagged Xenopus laevis Aurora A or TPX2 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) as described (17Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 691-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using pET30 Aurora A or pET30 TPX2 plasmid DNA as templates using standard mutagenesis procedures with Deep Vent DNA polymerase (NEB) to generate the required mutant cDNA. All cDNAs were fully sequenced to confirm mutations and to verify the absence of secondary point mutations. Aurora A activation by phosphorylation was investigated by mutation of several recently identified sites of autophosphorylation (18Haydon C.E. Eyers P.A. Aveline-Wolf L.D. Resing K.A. Maller J.L. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The regulatory T-loop residue (Thr-295, equivalent to Thr-288 in human Aurora A) was mutated to Ala, Glu, or Asp. Xenopus TPX2 was mutated at three putative Aurora A consensus phosphorylation sites in the N terminus (Ser-48, Ser-90, or Ser-94). Mutation to either Ala or Asp was accomplished by changing the cognate triplet codon to GCA or GAC, respectively. TPX2 and Aurora A deletion mutants (including a catalytic fragment of Aurora A (11Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), encompassing residues 127–407) were generated by PCR and cloned into the vector pET30, which encodes an N-terminal hexahistidine tag to enable rapid purification. Recombinant His-tagged Aurora A and TPX2 mutants were induced for 16–18 h with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified from the soluble bacterial fraction on Talon beads (Clontech). After dialysis proteins were separated in to aliquots and stored at -80 °C. GST-p53 (X. laevis) was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) from BL21 (DE3) cells induced for 20 h with 400 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The purified protein was >80% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining and was stored at -80 °C before assay. X. laevis Survivin (20Bolton M.A. Lan W. Powers S.E. McCleland M.L. Kuang J. Stukenberg P.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3064-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) was cloned from a Stage VI Xenopus cDNA library, and the cDNA was inserted into the vector pET41, which encodes N-terminal glutathione S-transferase and His6 affinity tags. GST-Survivin was purified from strain BL21 (DE3) using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The antibody that recognizes Aurora A only when phosphorylated at Thr-295 has been described previously as has the relative importance of Anderson- or Laemmli-type gels for analysis of Aurora A or TPX2 after phosphorylation (18Haydon C.E. Eyers P.A. Aveline-Wolf L.D. Resing K.A. Maller J.L. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Assay of Aurora A Activation by TPX2—Inactive (500 ng) or active (200 ng) recombinant Aurora A were preincubated on ice with 2 μg of recombinant TPX2-(1–364) or TPX2-(1–364) mutants in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Brij 35, 100 nm okadaic acid, 10 mm MgCl2), 0.5 mg/ml histone H3 and then assayed in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. Aurora A activity was assessed by TPX2 phosphorylation, histone H3 phosphorylation, or by Western blotting with an antibody that recognizes the active Thr-295-phosphorylated Aurora A. To quantify TPX2 and histone H3 phosphorylation, the Coomassie-stained bands were excised from the gel and analyzed by Cerenkov counting in a scintillation counter. Activation of Aurora A by TPX2-(1–364) or TPX2-(1–364) mutants was assessed using an assay that exhibited linear kinetics with respect to time, permitting direct comparison between the wild-type and mutant proteins. To assay Aurora A activation in the presence of TPX2 and/or histone H3 and GST-p53 or GST-Survivin, 5 μg of p53, 5 μg of Survivin, or 5 μg of BSA were preincubated for 10 min with Aurora A and TPX2 or histone H3 before phosphorylation for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated TPX2 or histone H3 was visualized by autoradiography. Protection of Aurora A Dephosphorylation by TPX2—Recombinant, active Aurora A (2 μg) was incubated in phosphatase buffer with 500 ng of PP1γ with or without preincubation with 2 μg of TPX2 or 2 μg of the TPX2-(1–364)/TPX2-(365–715) fragments. After 30 min the PP1γ was inactivated with okadaic acid (10 μm final concentration), and 200 ng of the Aurora A was assessed for activity using histone H3 (and TPX2) as substrate in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated with SDS sample buffer, and the TPX2-mediated protection of Aurora A inactivation by PP1γ was demonstrated by the simultaneous phosphorylation of histone H3 and TPX2. 32P-Labeled histone H3 and TPX2 proteins were visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE on an 12% gel. Determination of Stoichiometry of TPX2 Phosphorylation by Aurora A—To determine the stoichiometry of TPX2 phosphorylation by Aurora A, TPX2 (1–715, full-length), residues 365–715 (C-terminal half) or the N-terminal half of TPX2 containing amino acids 1–364 or mutant TPX2-(1–364) (S48A, S48A/S94A, and S48A/S90A/S94A, 60 pmol each) were incubated with 500 ng of recombinant active Aurora A for the indicated times at 30 °C in kinase buffer containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP of known specific activity (400 cpm/pmol). At each time point 10% of the reaction was withdrawn, and the reaction was terminated with SDS sample buffer. Covalent incorporation of phosphate into TPX2 was calculated by Cerenkov counting of the 32P-labeled Coomassie-stained TPX2 gel bands after separation from Aurora A by SDS-PAGE. Importance of Thr-295 Phosphorylation for Aurora A Activity—Aurora A is as an essential mitotic phosphoprotein (8Hirota T. Kunitoku N. Sasayama T. Marumoto T. Zhang D. Nitta M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. Cell. 2003; 114: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and a significant stoichiometric phosphorylation of Xenopus Aurora A occurs at seven Ser and Thr residues after synthesis and autophosphorylation in bacteria (17Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 691-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 18Haydon C.E. Eyers P.A. Aveline-Wolf L.D. Resing K.A. Maller J.L. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The incubation of inactive Aurora A with TPX2, Ajuba, or Xenopus M-phase extracts, which contain a poorly defined array of Aurora A-activating proteins, also promotes the phosphorylation of Aurora A (11Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that phosphorylation of multiple amino acids may be required for the activity of Aurora A toward exogenous substrates. To determine the relative importance of these phosphorylated residues, we individually mutated the seven previously determined Aurora A phosphorylation sites (18Haydon C.E. Eyers P.A. Aveline-Wolf L.D. Resing K.A. Maller J.L. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to Ala residues and expressed the mutant proteins in bacteria, where Aurora A stimulates its own autophosphorylation and autoactivation. This activation can be conveniently monitored by changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the kinase (17Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 691-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 18Haydon C.E. Eyers P.A. Aveline-Wolf L.D. Resing K.A. Maller J.L. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As a control we expressed kinase dead (D281A) or partially active (K169R) Aurora A mutants (18Haydon C.E. Eyers P.A. Aveline-Wolf L.D. Resing K.A. Maller J.L. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 the only site of phosphorylation that is required for autoactivation is the T-loop residue, Thr-295 (11Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Walter A.O. Seghezzi W. Korver W. Sheung J. Lees E.

Biol. 2003; 13: 691-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), because mutation of any of the other six residues to Ala does not abolish the decreased electrophoretic mobility of the kinase or block the activity of the kinase toward histone H3 or TPX2, two Aurora A substrates. Interestingly, mutation of the other Ser or Thr phosphorylation sites to Ala actually generates a minor enhancement of enzyme activity (e.g. compare T122A with wild type Aurora A), possibly due to reduced competition of autophosphorylation sites with the exogenous substrate histone H3. All kinase assays were performed so that substrate phosphorylation followed linear kinetics, to allow an accurate comparison of the activity of each mutant. The requirement for Thr-295 phosphorylation for Aurora A activity is well documented (11Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 691-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) as is the oncogenic pheno-type of cells expressing a T295D mutant of Aurora A, which presumably leads to constitutive (phosphatase-insensitive) activity (Ref. 9Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, but see Ref. 11Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly T295D or T295E mutants did not exhibit any detectable activity toward a non-specific substrate, histone H3, as previously described (Fig. 1, middle panel, and Ref. 11Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), but if the same mutants were preincubated with TPX2 and then assayed for phosphorylation of TPX2 (Fig. 1, bottom panel) or histone H3 (not shown), T295D and T295E exhibited significant phosphotransferase activity. This is consistent with recent crystallographic evidence that provides a molecular explanation for the extensive increase of Aurora A catalytic activity generated by association with TPX2 (22Bayliss R. Sardon T. Vernos I. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 4: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the loss of activity generated by mutation of T295 to Ala (or Val, not shown) can be partially rescued by binding of TPX2, but only using TPX2 phosphorylation as a marker of activity (compare Fig. 1, middle and bottom panels). A more significant rescue occurs with the partially active K169R mutant. However, no activation is evident if the D281A (kinase dead) mutant is assayed in the presence of TPX2, confirming the specificity of the reaction (Fig. 1, bottom panel). These findings emphasize the significant enhancement of Aurora A activity that occurs upon TPX2 binding and suggest that Aurora A activity should be examined against several unrelated substrates to assess activity in vitro (17Eyers P.A.

Ser-53 and Ser-349 are conserved in human and Xenopus Aurora A, and it is likely that Ser-53 phosphorylation regulates Aurora A degradation by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome in both species (33Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2274-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, Ser-53 phosphorylation is not required for kinase activity (Fig. 1 and Ref. 11Littlepage L.E. Wu H.

The mutation of Ser-12, Ser-53, Thr-103, Ser-116, or Thr-122 to Asp generated enzymes exhibiting wild-type activity after isolation from bacteria (data not shown); however, we confirmed a previous finding that mutation of Ser-349 to Asp markedly reduces activity (11Littlepage L.E.

This seemingly contradictory result can be rationalized by structural data suggesting that this mutation may disrupt a conserved ion pair in the kinase, thus preventing stabilization of the active conformation (11Littlepage L.E.

https://openalex.org/W1964461246,"Notch4, a member of the Notch family of transmembrane receptors, is expressed primarily on endothelial cells. Activation of Notch in various cell systems has been shown to regulate cell fate decisions, partly by regulating the propensity of cells to live or die. Various studies have demonstrated a role for Notch1 in modulating apoptosis, either in a positive or negative manner. In this study, we determined that constitutively active Notch4 (Notch4 intracellular domain) inhibited endothelial apoptosis triggered by lipopolysaccharide. Notch signals are transmitted by derepression and coactivation of the transcriptional repressor, RBP-Jκ, as well as by less well defined mechanisms that are independent of RBP-Jκ. A Notch mutant lacking the N-terminal RAM domain showed only partial antiapoptotic activity relative to Notch4 intracellular domain but stimulated equivalent RBP-Jκ-dependent transcriptional activity. Similarly, constitutively active RBP-Jκ activated a full transcriptional response but only demonstrated partial antiapoptotic activity. Additional studies suggest that Notch4 provides endothelial protection in two ways: inhibition of the JNK-dependent proapoptotic pathway in an RBP-Jκ-dependent manner and induction of an antiapoptotic pathway through an RBP-Jκ-independent up-regulation of Bcl-2. Our findings demonstrate that Notch4 activation inhibits apoptosis through multiple pathways and provides one mechanism to explain the remarkable capacity of endothelial cells to withstand apoptosis."

In humans, about 70% of circulating Hcy is N-linked to blood proteins, mostly to hemoglobin and albumin. It was unclear what protein site(s) were prone to Hcy attachment and how N-linked Hcy affected protein function. Here we show that Lys525 is a predominant site of N-homocysteinylation in human serum albumin in vitro and in vivo. We also show that the reactivity of albumin lysine residues, including Lys525, is affected by the status of Cys34. The disulfide forms of circulating albumin, albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys and albumin-Cys34-S-S-Hcy, are N-homocysteinylated faster than albumin-Cys34-SH. Although N-homocysteinylations of albumin-Cys34-SH and albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys yield different primary products, subsequent thiol-disulfide exchange reactions result in the formation of a single product, N-(Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-SH. We also show that N-homocysteinylation affects the susceptibility of albumin to oxidation and proteolysis. The data suggest that a disulfide at Cys34 of albumin promotes conversion of N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-SH to a proteolytically sensitive form N-(Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-SH, which would facilitate clearance of the N-homocysteinylated form of mercaptoalbumin.

During the past decade it has been established that even a mild increase in Hcy level is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke in humans (3Homocysteine Studies Collaboration J. Am. Med.

Plasma Hcy is also a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease (6Seshadri S. Beiser A. Selhub J. Jacques P.F. Rosenberg I.H. D'Agostino R.B. Wilson P.W. Wolf P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (2867) Google Scholar). In tissue cultures, Hcy does not support growth and induces apoptotic death in human endothelial cells (7Zhang C. Cai Y. Adachi M.T. Oshiro S. Aso T. Kaufman R.J. Kitajima S. J. Biol.

In humans, Hcy, formed from dietary methionine as a byproduct of cellular methylation reactions, is detoxified by folic acid- and vitamin B12-dependent re-methylation to methionine (2Rosenblatt D.S.

The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. II. McGraw Hill Inc., New York2001: 2007-2056Google Scholar). Whereas Hcy is formed in all human organs, most of its detoxification occurs in the liver and kidneys. Detoxification of Hcy in human vascular tissues and skin occurs only by re-methylation; enzymes of the trans-sulfuration pathway are not expressed in these tissues (9Chen P. Poddar R. Tipa E.V.

Hcy is perhaps the most reactive amino acid in biological systems (1Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Krauss J.P. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

In addition to re-methylation to methionine or trans-sulfuration to cysteine (via cystathionine), Hcy is also metabolically converted to Hcy-thiolactone, S-nitroso-Hcy, AdoHcy, Hcy-containing disulfides, or homocysteic acid, each of which has been implicated in the pathology of hyperhomocystinemia (1Mudd S.H.

For example, Hcy is metabolized to Hcy-thiolactone by methionyl-tRNA synthetase in a two-step reaction (19Jakubowski H. Fersht A.

In the first step (Reaction 1), methionyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzes activation of Hcy with ATP, which yields methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS)-bound homocysteinyl adenylate. MetRS+Hcy+ATP↔MetRs·Hcy˜AMP+PPiReaction 1 The second step (Reaction 2), in which the side chain thiolate of Hcy reacts with the activated carboxyl group of Hcy, yields Hcy-thiolactone. The energy of the anhydride bond in Hcy∼AMP is conserved in the thioester bond in Hcy-thiolactone. Because of this, Hcythiolactone reacts with proteins, forming Hcy-containing adducts, in which the carboxyl group of Hcy is linked by an amide bond with ϵ-amino group of a protein lysine residue (21Jakubowski H.

Academic Press Inc, San Diego, CA1996: 51-54Google Scholar): albumin-Cys34-SH, also known as mercaptoalbumin, and albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys (Fig. 1), accounting for about two-thirds and one-third, respectively, of total plasma albumin (31Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.S. Ueland P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Two minor forms, accounting for 1–2% of total albumin, also exist in circulation: albumin-Cys34-S-S-Hcy (Fig. 1) (31Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.S. Ueland P.M. Anal.

Molecular mechanism and functional consequences of albumin N-homocysteinylation were not known. In this study we show that Lys525 is a predominant site of N-homocysteinylation in human serum albumin. We also show that the status of Cys34 affects the reactivity of albumin lysine residues, including Lys525, and that N-homocysteinylation affects the susceptibility of albumin to proteolysis and oxidation. Preparation of [35S]Hcy-thiolactone—Carrier-free l-[35S]Met (5 mCi, Amersham Biosciences) was supplemented with unlabeled methionine (Sigma) to a specific activity of 20,000 Ci/mol, lyophilized on a Labconco CentriVap concentrator, dissolved in 0.15 ml of 57% hydriodic acid, and digested for 4 h at 128 °C (33Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21813-21816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The conversion of l-[35S]Met to l-[35S]Hcy-thiolactone was complete as determined by analytical thin layer chromatography. Excess hydriodic acid was removed by lyophilization, and l-[35S]Hcy-thiolactone was dissolved in deionized water at 15 μCi/ml, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of Albumin-Cys34-SH and Albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys—Human serum albumin (50 mg/ml) was converted to albumin-Cys34-SH by treatment with 2 mm DTT in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA for 5 min at room temperature, diluted 10-fold with 0.01 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, and purified by anion exchange HPLC. Fractions containing albumin-Cys34-SH were concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, and treated with 2-fold molar excess of Cys overnight at 37 °C. Excess Cys was removed from albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys by ultrafiltration through an Ultrafree-0.5 10-kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore) at 4 °C. The conversion of albumin-Cys34-SH to albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys was monitored by anion exchange HPLC. Preparation of Albumin-Cys34-S-IAA—Albumin-Cys34-SH (10 mg/ml) was incubated with 4-fold molar excess IAA in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Excess IAA was removed by ultrafiltration. The conversion of albumin-Cys34-SH to albumin-Cys34-S-IAA was complete as determined by anion exchange HPLC. Preparation of N-Hcy-Proteins—Individual proteins (obtained from Sigma) were dissolved at 50 mg/ml in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with 1–2 molar excess of unlabeled l-Hcy-thiolactone. Under these conditions the extent of modification was 0.6–0.75 mol of Hcy/mol of protein. The extent of modification has been determined by the formation of N-[35S]Hcy-protein, assayed either by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (22Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), in parallel reactions with identical concentrations of [35S]Hcy-thiolactone or by monitoring the increase in protein thiol groups with Ellman's reagent (Sigma) (34Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Both methods gave similar results. Susceptibility of Hcy-thiolactone-modified Albumin to Oxidation— Unmodified albumin or N-Hcy-albumin (at 10 mg/ml) were incubated with or without 5-fold molar excess of H2O2 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 15 min at 37 °C. The formation of albumin aggregates after oxidation was analyzed by anion exchange HPLC. Anion Exchange HPLC—Albumin species (5 mg/ml) were analyzed by anion exchange HPLC on a Vydac 301VHP575 DEAE column (7.5 × 50 mm, 5 μm, 900 Å) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 5.8 (buffer A), and eluted with a linear gradient 0–250 mm NaCl (40 min, 1 ml/min) in buffer A. The elution conditions were somewhat modified for each experiment to achieve optimal separation of analyzed albumin species. In some experiments, a nonporous Tosohaas TSK-gel DNA-NPR column (4.6 × 75 mm, 2.5 μm) was used with similar results. The effluent was monitored at 280 nm using a diode array detector. Susceptibility of Hcy-thiolactone-modified Albumin to Proteolysis— Albumin-Cys34-SH, N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-SH, albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys, N-(Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-SH, and N-(Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys (Fig. 1) (1–2 mg/ml) were digested with trypsin (l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated), chymotrypsin, elastase, or cathepsin D (all from Sigma) at substrate/enzyme ratios from 1:400 to 1:1 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2.5 h at 37 °C. Digests were mixed 1:1 with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, denatured for 5 min at 100 °C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (J. T. Baker Inc.) and quantified by densitometry. Purification of Native Albumin from Human Serum—Human serum (0.3 ml) was diluted with 1 volume of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and loaded onto a 1-ml High-Trap Blue column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing off unbound protein, albumin was eluted with 2 m NaCl and desalted by ultrafiltration. Enrichment of N-Hcy-albumin with Thiopropyl-Sepharose—Crystal structure of albumin-Cys34-SH shows that Cys34 is located in a crevice about 10 Å deep (30Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin. Academic Press Inc, San Diego, CA1996: 51-54Google Scholar), and because of this, access to Cys34 is somewhat limited. In contrast, N-linked Hcy in N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-SH is expected to be freely accessible. Indeed, in control experiments we found that N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-SH binds well, whereas albumin-Cys34-SH binds very poorly to thiopropyl-Sepharose. We utilized this property to enrich native albumin in N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin. Native albumin (50 mg/ml) was first converted into mercaptoalbumin by treatment with 2 mm DTT in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA. After removal of low molecular weight thiols by ultrafiltration on Ultrafree-05 30-kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore), mercaptoalbumin (50 mg/ml) was allowed to bind to washed thiopropyl-Sepharose (120 mg) in 0.4 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 5.0, for 20 min at 21 °C. The resin was washed with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 5.0, 0.1 m NaCl to remove unbound protein. Bound albumin was eluted with 0.5 ml of 25 mm DTT in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, desalted, and concentrated to 50 μl in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 5.0. Resulting albumin preparation was subjected to Thiopropyl-Sepharose enrichment two more times. About 7% of native albumin was bound to and recovered from thiopropyl-Sepharose after three cycles of enrichment. Preparation of Tryptic Peptides—N-Hcy-albumin or native albumin (10 mg/ml) was reduced with 25 mm DTT in 10 m urea, 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, 1 mm EDTA (5 h at 21 °C), and the liberated thiols were blocked with 100 mm IAA for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. IAA-modified albumin was desalted by ultrafiltration and digested with l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (enzyme/substrate ratio 1:50) in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C. Reversed Phase C18 HPLC—HPLC analyses of tryptic peptides were carried out using a reversed phase C18 peptide-protein column (4.6 × 100 mm, 5 μ, 300 Å) from Vydac. The detection was by monitoring at 215 nm using a diode array detector. After sample application, the C18 HPLC column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 40% acetonitrile (60 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Cation Exchange HPLC—N-Hcy-peptides from a C18 column were further purified by cation exchange on a PolySULFOETHYL Aspartamide™ column (2.1 × 200 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å, PolyLC, Inc.). Solution A (50 mm potassium phosphate-HCl, pH 3.4) and solution B (500 mm NaCl in solution A) were used as solvents, and the flow rate was 0.6 ml/min. After sample application, the column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 60% solution B for 20 min. HPLC Instrumentation—HPLC instrumentation was Beckman-Coulter System Gold Noveau as described before (24Jakubowski H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30425-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It consisted of the following modules: advanced gradient solvent delivery module 126 and a high resolution diode array 168 detector module. Manual injector (7725i Rheodyne) with a 0.1-ml loop was used. Chromatograms were analyzed using Gold Noveau chromatography work station software for Windows. Mass Spectroscopy—Peptide mass analyses were carried out by Dr. Hong Li on a MALDI-TOF Voyager-DE™ PRO Biospectrometry™ work station (PerSeptive Biosystems) at the New Jersey Medical School Center for Advanced Proteomics Research facility (njms.umdnj.edu/biochemistry/proteomics/index.htm). Hcy-thiolactone Reacts Faster with Albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys and Albumin-Cys34-S-S-Hcy than with Albumin-Cys34-SH—To determine whether the status of Cys34 in human serum albumin affects the susceptibility of that protein to N-homocysteinylation, albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys, albumin-Cys34-S-S-Hcy, and albumin-Cys34-SH (Fig. 1), major forms of circulating albumin (30Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin. Academic Press Inc, San Diego, CA1996: 51-54Google Scholar, 31Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.S. Ueland P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” and incubated with [35S]Hcy-thiolactone. The formation of N-[35S]Hcy-albumin was monitored by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. As shown in Fig. 2, albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys and albumin-Cys34-S-S-Hcy were N-homocysteinylated at similar rates. However, both disulfide forms of albumin were N-homocysteinylated 47 ± 5% faster than mercaptoalbumin, albumin-Cys34-SH. Similar results were obtained when corresponding forms of albumin were prepared in situ by treatments with 5-fold molar excess Cys, Hcy, or DTT. These results suggest that the reactivity of albumin lysine residues depends on the status of Cys34. Thiol-Disulfide Exchange in N-Homocysteinylated Albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys Leads to Formation of Free Sulfhydryl at Cys34—Albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys or albumin-Cys34-SH was modified with equimolar amounts of Hcy-thiolactone and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC. Unmodified albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys was eluted from the HPLC column at 13.2 min (Fig. 3A, broken trace). After 4 h of modification, about 50% of albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys was N-homocysteinylated and eluted from the column as a new peak at 12.6 min, before the peak of unmodified form (Fig. 3A, thin trace). After 20 h of modification, all albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys disappeared, and only a single peak of N-homocysteinylated albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys at 12.6 min was observed (Fig. 3A, thick trace). Both native and N-homocysteinylated albumin-Cys34-SH were eluted from the anion exchange HPLC column at 12.6 min (not shown). Altered chromatographic behavior of albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys after modification with Hcy-thiolactone could be due to two alternative mechanisms. First, blocking an ϵ-amino group of lysine residue(s) by N-homocysteinylation may have changed the charge of albumin, thus weakening its binding to the anion exchange column. However, this seems unlikely because similar modification of albumin-Cys34-SH did not affect its elution position from the column. Instead, N-homocysteinylation of albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys may have caused regeneration of a free thiol at Cys34 as a result of thiol-disulfide exchange between a free thiol of newly incorporated Hcy and the disulfide at Cys34 (Reaction 3). Hcy-thiolactione+albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys→N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys↔N-(Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-SHReaction 3 This interpretation is supported by an observation that regeneration of a disulfide at Cys34 by incubation of N-(Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-SH with 2-fold molar excess of cysteine also restored its stronger binding to the anion exchange column (Fig. 3B). To examine more directly whether N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys and N-(Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys are formed in significant amounts during N-homocysteinylation of albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys, [35S]Hcy-thiolactone was used. If formed, N-([35S]Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys and N-([35S]Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys would co-elute with albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys from the anion exchange HPLC column. However, as shown in Fig. 3C, only a single peak of radioactivity (at 12.6 min), corresponding to N-([35S]Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-SH, was observed. There was no distinct 35S-radioactivity peak at the elution position of albumin-Cys34-disulfide (at 13.2 min). This result demonstrates that a single species, N-([35S]Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-SH, is predominant during N-homocysteinylation of albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys; other products are not observed. The absence of N-([35S]Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys suggests that its conversion to N-([35S]Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-SH is much faster that the N-homocysteinylation reaction. The absence of N-([35S]Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys suggests that the thiol-disulfide exchange between N-([35S]Hcy-S-S-Cys)-albumin-Cys34-SH and albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys is not favored thermodynamically. To determine whether the thiol-disulfide exchange occurs in trans between different albumin molecules, preparations of N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-SH and albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys were used. When analyzed separately by anion exchange HPLC, N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-SH (Fig. 4, thin trace) and albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys (Fig. 4, broken trace) were eluted at 9.9 and 10.25 min, respectively. However, when N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-SH was incubated with equimolar amounts of albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys for 4 h at 37 °C and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC, only a peak at 9.9 min was observed (Fig. 4, thick trace) and the peak of albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys at 10.25 min essentially disappeared. This shows that albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys was converted to albumin-Cys34-SH. Thus, the thioldisulfide exchange occurs in trans. To determine whether a thiol of Cys34 in N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-SH is required for the thiol-disulfide exchange, albumin was first treated with IAA to block the Cys34 thiol and then N-homocysteinylated. This yielded an albumin derivative containing a single free thiol on N-linked Hcy, N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-S-IAA. When analyzed by anion exchange HPLC, N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-S-IAA (Fig. 5, thin trace) was eluted at 13.3 min, essentially identical to the retention time of albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys (Fig. 5, broken trace). However, when N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-S-IAA was mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio with albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC, a new peak of albumin-Cys34-SH (eluting at 12.9 min) was observed (Fig. 5, thick trace). This shows that albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys was converted to albumin-Cys34-SH as a result of a thiol-disulfide exchange with a thiol of N-linked Hcy in N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-S-IAA. Control experiments have shown that albumin-Cys34-S-IAA and N-(Hcy-S-IAA)-albumin-Cys34-S-IAA did not participate in the thiol-disulfide exchange with albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys, as expected. IAA derivatives of different N-homocysteinylated forms of albumin eluted at 13.3 min, a retention time characteristic of albumin with substituted thiol of Cys34 (not shown). Taken together, these experiments suggest that a thiol of Cys34 in N-(Hcy-SH)-albumin-Cys34-SH is not required for the thiol-disulfide exchange involving N-linked Hcy. We next examined whether other N-homocysteinylated proteins can participate in the thiol-disulfide exchange with albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys. An experiment with N-(Hcy-SH)-transferrin and albumin is shown in Fig. 6. The preparation of albumin (solid trace) contained albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys and albumin-Cys34-SH, which elute from an anion exchange HPLC column with retention times of 14.0 and 13.2 min, respectively. The retention time of transferrin was 4 min. When albumin and N-(Hcy-SH)-transferrin were mixed together and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC, the peak of albumin-Cys34-S-S-Cys at 14.0 min c"

We showed previously that targeted deletion of Ptgs2 encoding COX-2, but not Ptgs1 encoding COX-1, in C57BL/6J/129 mice produces complete female infertility resulting from multiple reproductive failures spanning ovulation, fertilization, and implantation. Here we show that Ptgs2 null mice on a CD1 background have dramatically improved female fertility including ovulation, fertilization, and implantation, giving rise to live births. We provide evidence that this improved fertility in CD1 Ptgs2 null mice is the result of a compensatory up-regulation of Ptgs1 which does not occur in C57BL/6J/129 mice missing Ptgs2. These results clearly demonstrate for the first time that COX-1 can replace specific functions of COX-2 in vivo in the context of genetic disparity. In light of this finding, the therapeutic use and efficacy of COX-2-specific inhibitors among human populations without regard for genetic and ethnic diversities should be revisited.

Cyclooxygenases, COX 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase(s); eCG, equine chorionic gonadotropin; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; PG, prostaglandin; PLA2, phospholipase A2; sPLA2, secretory PLA2.1The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase(s); eCG, equine chorionic gonadotropin; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; PG, prostaglandin; PLA2, phospholipase A2; sPLA2, secretory PLA2.-1 and COX-2, mediate the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin (PG)H2, which is then converted to various PGs by specific synthases (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Although both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms are encoded by separate genes, Ptgs1 and Ptgs2, respectively, they share similar structural and kinetic properties and show distinct cell-specific expression and regulation (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). COX-1 is thought to serve “housekeeping” functions as a constitutive enzyme. COX-2, however, is highly inducible by diverse stimuli including cytokines, growth factors, mitogens, and tumor promoters and regulates inflammation, differentiation, mitogenesis, and angiogenesis (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar).PGs are implicated in various physiological and pathological functions because of their vasoactive, mitogenic, and differentiating properties (2Dubois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Van De Putte L.B. Lipsky P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Ovulation and implantation are considered analogous to “proinflammatory” responses, and thus participation of PGs in these processes has long been speculated. For example, gonadotropin-mediated Ptgs2 expression in ovarian follicles preceding ovulation is consistent with the presumed role of PGs in follicular rupture during ovulation (3Sirois J. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11586-11592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Joyce I.M. Pendola F.L. O'Brien M. Eppig J.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3187-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PGs are also implicated as important mediators of increased localized endometrial vascular permeability at the site of the blastocyst during implantation, a prerequisite condition for this process. Distinct expression patterns of COX isoforms in the peri-implantation mouse uterus suggest their roles in uterine biology and implantation (5Chakraborty I. Das S.K. Wang J. Dey S.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The relative importance of COX isoforms in female fertility has been characterized by gene targeting studies in mice. The loss of the Ptgs2 gene leads to multiple reproductive failures that include ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and decidualization (6Dinchuk J.E. Car B.D. Focht R.J. Johnston J.J.

For example, the targeting of the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) locus showed that although epidermal growth factor receptor deficiency on a CF1 background results in peri-implantation death caused by the degeneration of the inner cell mass, this deficiency on a 129/Sv background led to placental defects giving rise to mid-gestational embryonic lethality. In contrast, Egfr mutation on a CD1 background produced early postnatal lethality with abnormal functions of the skin, kidney, brain, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (11Threadgill D.W. Dlugosz A.A.

We now show for the first time that a compensatory up-regulation of Ptgs1 remarkably improves female fertility under Ptgs2 deficiency in a particular genetic context. Furthermore, COX-1, which is usually considered as a constitutive enzyme, becomes tightly regulated and functions as an inducible isoform similar to the native COX-2 under such a condition. Our present observations of differential Ptgs2-deficient phenotypes on different genetic backgrounds have significant clinical implications, as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and COX-2-selective inhibitors are widely used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases without regard for genetic diversities among human populations (15Flower R.J. Nat. Rev.

Genome Res. 2000; 10: 30-41PubMed Google Scholar), to explore whether Ptgs2 null female mice on different genetic backgrounds exhibit different reproductive phenotypes, we introduced Ptgs2 deficiency in CD1 mice by crossing with C57BL/6J/129 Ptgs2+/- mice generated originally. In brief, C57BL/6J/129 Ptgs2+/- females were crossed to CD1 wild-type males producing an F1 generation. F1 Ptgs2+/- females were then back-crossed to CD1 wild-type males, and the process was continued for eight generations. Crossing heterozygous females with heterozygous males of the same genetic background generated littermate wild-type and homozygous Ptgs2 null mice for experiments. The presence of variable genotypes of secretory phospholipase A2-IIA (sPLA2-IIA), as expected, in CD1 wild-type and mutant mice 2H. Wang and S. K. Dey, unpublished results. in contrast to the total absence of sPLA2-IIA caused by natural null mutation in C57BL/6J/129 mice provides evidence that this back-crossing protocol restored most of the CD1 genetic elements. All of the mice used were housed in the Institutional Animal Care Facility according to National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines for laboratory animals.Ovulation and Fertilization—To examine ovulation and fertilization, mice were mated with fertile males (day 1 = vaginal plug) with the same background and genotypes, respectively. Mice were killed on days 1 and 2 of pregnancy, and oviducts were flushed with Whitten’s medium to recover eggs and embryos. Their morphology was examined under an inverted microscope. To induce superovulation, mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) followed by a second injection of 5 IU of human CG (hCG) 48 h later (16Matsumoto H. Ma W.G. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mice were placed overnight with fertile males and checked for vaginal plugs the next morning.Implantation, Decidualization, Postimplantation Embryonic Growth, and Term Pregnancy—Implantation sites on days 5-8 of pregnancy were visualized by an intravenous injection of Chicago blue dye solution (17Paria B.C.

Uterine horns on days 5 and 6 without implantation sites were flushed with Whitten’s medium to recover unimplanted blastocysts. To induce experimental decidualization, pseudopregnant mice received an intraluminal infusion of 25 μl of sesame oil in one uterine horn on day 4 (10 a.m.) and were killed 4 days later. Uterine weights of the infused and noninfused (control) horns were recorded, and the -fold increases in uterine weights were used as an index of decidualization (7Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K.

To examine rescue of decidualization by Ptgs1 in Ptgs2 null mice, a COX-1-selective inhibitor SC560 was used. It was prepared in 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose and 0.1% (v/v) polysorbate 80 in water. First oral gavage (2 mg/kg of body weight) was given at 1700 h on the day of intrauterine oil infusion followed by gavage twice every day (9 a.m. and 5 p.m.) until day 7. Mice were sacrificed on day 8.To examine postimplantation embryonic growth, day 12 implantation sites and embryos were examined as described previously (18Song H. Lim H. Paria B.C. Matsumoto H. Swift L.L. Morrow J. Bonventre J.V. Dey S.K. Development. 2002; 129: 2879-2889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, dissected day 12 implantation sites were weighed individually, fixed in 10% formalin overnight, and dissected to isolate embryos. Isolated embryos were weighed individually, and their images were captured to examine the size and gross morphology. To examine pregnancy outcome in Ptgs2-/- mice, vaginal plug-positive mice were observed for delivery of pups at term. Litter size and days of pregnancy were recorded.Blastocyst Transfer—Mating females with wild-type vasectomized males induced pseudopregnancy. Day 4 wild-type blastocysts were transferred into uterine lumens of day 4 pseudopregnant recipients (7Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K.

On days 5 and 6, the number of implantation sites was recorded after intravenous injections of Chicago blue dye solution (17Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To examine postimplantation embryo growth, recipients were killed on day 12 of pregnancy.Prostaglandin Assays—PGs were quantitated using gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric assays as described previously (19Lim H.

Improved female fertility with the birth of viable pups in CD1 Ptgs2-/- mice was observed (Table I) compared with complete pregnancy failure in C57BL/6J/129 null mice as observed previously (7Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). To determine the cause(s) of this improved fertility in CD1 Ptgs2-/- female mice, we examined in detail their reproductive phenotypes during pregnancy.Table ITerm pregnancy occurs in CD1 Ptgs2-deficient mice CD1 wild-type and Ptgs2-/- mice were bred with fertile males with the same genotypes, respectively. Plug-positive mice were observed for delivery of pups at term, and litter size was recorded. Although term pregnancy occurred in CD1 Ptgs2-deficient mice, the litter size was significantly smaller compared with wild-type females (unpaired t test, *, p < 0.001).GenotypeNo. of sperm-positive miceNo. of mice with term pregnancyLitter sizeWild-type1010 (100%)14.5 ± 0.8CD1 Ptgs2-/-4420 (45%)3.7 ± 0.8* Open table in a new tab To examine the ovulation and fertilization status, the number of ovulated eggs and two-cell embryos on day 2 of pregnancy were recorded. To our surprise, a remarkable improvement in ovulation was noted in CD1 Ptgs2-/- mice as opposed to our previous observation of severely compromised ovulation in C57BL/6J/129 mutant mice (7Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 16Matsumoto H. Ma W.G. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, all of the CD1 Ptgs2-/- mice (n = 19) ovulated with numbers of ova comparable with those of wild-type females (n = 7). In addition, an improvement in the fertilization rate in CD1 mutant mice was noted, albeit at a reduced level (Fig. 1A). An average of five two-cell embryos was recovered in 14 of 19 (74%) CD1 Ptgs2-/- mice. Although this is lower than the rate in wild-type mice, it is much higher than the rate in C57BL/6J/129 mutant mice observed previously (7Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 16Matsumoto H. Ma W.G. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A similar profile of ovulation and fertilization was observed in these null mice after superovulation.2 However, the cause of this reduced number of two-cell embryos remained unclear. We surmised that reduced numbers of two-cell embryos was the result of reduced fertilization rate in CD1 Ptgs2 null females because of defective oocyte maturation and/or aberrant coupling of the cumulus-oocyte complex.Thus, we examined the status of ovulated eggs on day 1 of pregnancy in CD1 Ptgs2-/-mice. Consistent with the observation of results recorded on day 2, all of the Ptgs2 null mice examined (n = 11) ovulated, and 35% (46/131) of the oocytes were fertilized as indicated by newly formed male and female pronuclei, although a number of Ptgs2 null oocytes showed signs of degeneration or fragmentation (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that failure of some oocytes to undergo fertilization was because of their inability to resume meiosis and subsequent maturation during ovulation. In addition, failure of sperm penetration and sperm-egg fusion was frequently observed in CD1 Ptgs2-/- mice (Fig. 1C). Because Ptgs2 null males are fertile, we speculated that functional deficiency of either oocytes or of somatic cumulus cells led to fertilization failure. CD9, a cell surface molecule, is necessary and a marker for normal sperm and oocyte membrane fusion during fertilization (22Kaji K. Oda S. Shikano T. Ohnuki T. Uematsu Y. Sakagami J. Tada N. Miyazaki S. Kudo A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). We observed normal localization of CD9 in Ptgs2 null oocytes (Fig. 1D), eliminating the defective sperm-egg fusion as the cause of reduced fertilization. Thus, deficient cumulus cell function under Ptgs2 deficiency appears to be a cause for the lower fertilization rate. Indeed, an impaired morphology of the cumulus-oocyte complex with fewer layers of outside cumulus cells and altered mucification was observed in CD1 Ptgs2 null mice (Fig. 1E). Collectively, our results show that ovulation and to considerable extent fertilization are improved with the introduction of CD1 genetic background in Ptgs2 null females.Differential Spatiotemporal Expression of Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 Correlates with Differential Ovulation and Fertilization in C57BL/6J/129 and CD1 Mice Lacking Ptgs2—To examine the cause(s) of improved ovulation in CD1 versus C57BL/6J/129 Ptgs2-/- mice, we next compared in parallel the ovarian expression profiles of Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 during ovulation in wild-type mice and Ptgs1 expression in Ptgs2 mutant mice on CD1 and C57BL/6J/129 backgrounds. A standard superovulation regimen using a combination of eCG and hCG protocol was applied to stimulate follicular growth and induce ovulation at a defined time point (16Matsumoto H. Ma W.G. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Under this treatment schedule, ovulation normally occurs between 12 and 14 h after hCG injection. Ovarian sections were processed for in situ hybridization of Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 at different time points after hCG injections.An interesting differential Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 expression pattern was observed in C57BL/6J/129 and CD1 wild-type ovaries after hCG stimulation. Although very little Ptgs1 or Ptgs2 mRNA was detected at 0 h, with the initiation of the ovulatory process Ptgs2 expression was induced markedly at 4 h in the preovulatory follicles in both strains of mice. Interestingly, this expression in C57BL/6J/129 mouse ovaries persisted through 12 h followed by a dramatic down-regulation at 16 h post-hCG injection, whereas in CD1 mouse ovaries the expression declined dramatically at 8 h approaching 0 h levels (Fig. 2, A and B). However, at 12 h, Ptgs2 expression was again detected, but at a much lower level compared with high Ptgs2 expression in C57BL/6J/129 ovaries (Fig. 2, A and B). After ovulation (16 h), Ptgs2 expression in CD1 ovaries diminished rapidly reminiscent of that observed for C57BL/6J/129 mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Despite the temporal differences in Ptgs2 expression between these two strains of mice during ovulation, its expression was consistently localized to mural and cumulus granulosa cells of mature follicles. Ptgs1 expression in C57BL/6J/129 mice was first observed at 8 h at very low levels followed by a remarkable up-regulation at 12 h with slight down-regulation at 16 h post-hCG stimulation. In CD1 ovaries, the induction was evident at 4 h with further up-regulation at 8 h followed by persistent expression through 16 h post-hCG stimulation. In contrast to Ptgs2 expression, the expression of Ptgs1 was always restricted to mural granulosa cells with no detectable signals in cumulus cells. In the absence of Ptgs2, Ptgs1 expression profiles at these time points in both strains of mice remained similar to those in wild-type ovaries.Fig. 2Differential expression profiles of Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 in C57BL/6J/129 and CD1 Ptgs2-/- mouse ovaries during ovulation. A standard superovulation regimen using a combination of eCG and hCG protocol was applied to stimulate follicular growth and induce ovulation at a defined time point. Ovarian sections from C57BL/6J/129 (A) and CD1 (B) wild-type (WT) or Ptgs2-/- mice were processed for in situ hybridization at different time points after hCG injections. Images are shown at 40×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The analysis of ovulation and fertilization together with the expression studies in wild-type and mutant ovaries suggests that the relative contribution of COX-1- or COX-2-derived PGs in ovulation and fertilization depends upon the genetic background of mice. The results also provide evidence that expression of either COX-1 or COX-2 in mural granulosa cells between 4 and 8 h before ovulation is crucial for successful completion of this process, whereas cumulus cell expression of COX-2 is a critical determinant for normal oocyte maturation and fertilization. This is consistent with failure of ovulation and fertilization in C57BL/6J/129 Ptgs2 mutant females as opposed to normal ovulation with reduced fertilization rates in CD1 mutant females. Although the general consensus is that cell-specific expression of Ptgs2 in preovulatory follicles is critical to ovulation (3Sirois J. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11586-11592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Joyce I.M. Pendola F.L. O'Brien M. Eppig J.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3187-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), our present investigation provides evidence that COX-1 is equally important in this process if expressed in the right place at the right time. We think that the restoration of ovulation in CD1 COX-2 null mice as opposed to failure of ovulation in C57BL/6J/129 mice is the result of early and prolonged ovarian expression of COX-1 in CD1 ovaries rather than in C57BL/6J/129 ovaries in which COX-1 expression is very transient (Fig. 2, A and B).CD1 Pregnant Mice Exhibit Improved Implantation in the Absence of COX-2—The “window” of implantation is defined as the limited time span during which the implantation-competent blastocyst establishes a reciprocal interaction with the receptive uterus (17Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 23Ma W.G. Song H. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2963-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In mice, the uterus becomes receptive on day 4 of pregnancy with the initiation of the attachment reaction around midnight of the same day (20Das S.K. Wang X.N. Paria B.C. Damm D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Development. 1994; 120: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to normal ovulation and improved fertilization, successful term pregnancy occurred in 45% of the plug-positive CD1 Ptgs2 null mice with small litter sizes (Table I). This is in sharp contrast to our present and previous observations of complete failure of successful pregnancy in C57BL/6J/129 Ptgs2-/- females (7Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). However, frequent pregnancy failures (55%) in CD1 Ptgs2-/- mice suggested that uterine defects from the time of fertilization to parturition still persist. We thus investigated whether one cause of this failure was aberrant implantation and/or decidualization in these mice. Increased vascular permeability at the site of blastocysts, as an index of normal implantation, was recorded on days 5, 6, and 8 of the pregnancy by the blue dye method (17Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We observed that a significant number of blastocysts implanted in CD1 Ptgs2 null mice, but the timing of implantation (window of implantation) became variable (Fig. 3, A-C). On midmorning of day 5 of pregnancy, an average of about 14 implantation sites (13.5 ± 0.4/mouse) were observed in all 9 wild-type plug-positive mice, whereas only ∼3 implantation sites (3.2 ± 0.5/mouse) were detected in 40% (17/42) of the plug-positive CD1 Ptgs2-/- mice.

We show here that withdrawal of all survival factors from MK-PT cells is associated with a progressive increase in the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2) and a progressive decrease in phosphorylated Akt, a kinase critical to cell survival. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2, the immediate upstream kinase for ERK1/2, not only prevented the decrease in phosphorylated Akt, but also prolonged MK-PT cell survival. Inhibition of ERK1/2, by itself, in the absence of any other known survival factors, was as potent as epidermal growth factor in maintaining MK-PT cell viability. ERK1/2 co-immunoprecipitated with Akt in a multimolecular assembly of signaling molecules, containing at a minimum ERK1/2, Akt, Rsk, and 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). We hypothesize that the kinase Rsk, whose activation requires phosphorylation by both ERK1/2 and PDK1, acts as a bridge bringing ERK1/2 into proximity with PDK1-associated Akt. Although a number of interactions between the Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways have been described, our results are the first to show modulation of Akt activity by signaling events originating with ERK1/2. Spontaneous activation of ERK1/2 occurs via MEK1/2 and appears to depend on oxidant stress, accompanying induction of the default pathway of apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that the spontaneous activation of ERK1/2, in the absence of known extracellular stimuli, represents a previously unrecognized major regulatory pathway determining the fate of cells destined to die by the default pathway of apoptosis.

An intimate relationship exists between the cell cycle and apoptosis (1Blagosklonny M.V. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 3Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 63: 119-228Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). In general, the same soluble factors that induce cell proliferation are also potent inhibitors of apoptosis (2Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 3Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C.

When used to stimulate proliferation, these factors are typically referred to as growth factors. In contrast, when these same factors are used to inhibit apoptosis and maintain cell viability, they are referred to as “survival factors.” In the absence of any survival factors, most, if not all, cells will undergo apoptosis (4Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). Appreciation of this phenomenon has led to the concept that all cells possess a genetically inbuilt “default pathway” capable of initiating apoptotic death, unless specifically inhibited by signals from the extracellular environment (2Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 3Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C.

Thus, to maintain viability, a cell must receive a more or less continuous stream of extracellular “survival signals,” so as to keep its default pathway in a state of constant inactivation (2Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 3Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C.

Inhibition of apoptosis by survival factors is therefore an example of negative regulation, meaning that, in the absence of survival factors, cells will automatically undergo apoptosis.Recent studies have shown that activation by growth and survival factors of several key intracellular signaling molecules, including Ras (5Gille H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 261-267Scopus (33) Google Scholar), occurs in two distinct waves of activity. The first wave begins almost immediately after stimulation and is typically transient, lasting no more than 30–60 min. After this time, activity subsides to baseline levels, despite the continued presence of growth factors (5Gille H. Downward J. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, after several hours of signaling “silence,” a second wave of signaling activity spontaneously emerges, despite the absence of any additional extracellular stimuli (5Gille H. Downward J.

This second wave of activity persists for several hours and leads to cellular responses and downstream signaling events that are distinct from those associated with the initial signaling response to growth factors (6Jones S.M.

We speculated that delayed waves of signaling activity, occurring in the absence of exogenous ligands, might play a role in the executionary phase of apoptosis, or, alternatively, they might promote survival by mediating events that allow the cell to adjust to a now “hostile” environment.We tested our hypothesis using primary cultures of mouse kidney proximal tubular epithelial (MK-PT) cells. We have previously shown that MK-PT cells undergo apoptosis over 7–10 days when deprived of all soluble survival factors (13Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Triaca V.T. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F575-F585PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lieberthal W. Triaca V. Koh J.S. Pagano P.J. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F691-F702PubMed Google Scholar, 15Iglesias J. Abernethy V.E.

Physiol. 2000; 278: F758-F768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We focused our studies of the effects of growth factor deprivation on two distinct signaling pathways, the ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt pathways, both of which play key roles in the regulation of proliferation and survival (1Blagosklonny M.V.

BioEssays. 1999; 21: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), and a progressive decrease in the activity of Akt a kinase critical to cell survival (2Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 17Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar, 18Stein R.C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 prevented the decline in Akt activity and prolonged the survival of MK-PT cells. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 was as potent as epidermal growth factor (EGF) in inhibiting the default pathway of apoptosis and maintaining the viability of MK-PT cells.These data demonstrate that activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways can occur in cells deprived of all extracellular growth or survival factors. The signaling events that we demonstrate are induced by survival factor withdrawal and include activation of ERK1/2 and inhibition of Akt. The fact that pharmacological modulation of these signaling events alters cell viability suggests that these events play an important role in regulating the fate of cells deprived of survival factors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Culture of Mouse Kidney Proximal Tubular Epithelial (MK-PT) Cells—MK-PT cells were cultured from collagenase-digested fragments of proximal tubules obtained from the cortices of C57BL/6 mice using a modification of previously described methods (13Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Triaca V.T. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F575-F585PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lieberthal W. Triaca V. Koh J.S. Pagano P.J. Levine J.S. Am. J.

Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical tubules were plated in serum-free, defined culture medium (1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 containing 2 mm glutamine, 15 mm HEPES, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 50 nm hydrocortisone, 500 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). MK-PT cells grew from the tubules and formed a confluent epithelial monolayer over 4 days. We have demonstrated that MK-PT cells grown by this technique have the morphological, biochemical, and transport features characteristic of proximal tubular cells (14Lieberthal W. Triaca V. Koh J.S. Pagano P.J. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F691-F702PubMed Google Scholar, 15Iglesias J. Abernethy V.E. Wang Z. Lieberthal W. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. Am. J.

Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar). On the 5th day following plating of tubules, designated as time “zero” (t = 0) of the experimental period, confluent monolayers of MK-PT cells were subjected to experimental conditions and studied for an additional 5 days (14Lieberthal W. Triaca V. Koh J.S. Pagano P.J. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F691-F702PubMed Google Scholar, 15Iglesias J. Abernethy V.E. Wang Z. Lieberthal W. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. Am. J.

Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar).Experimental Treatment of MK-PT Cells—On day “zero,” MK-PT cells were subjected to one of two experimental conditions. MK-PT cells designated as “EGF present” were incubated in DMEM:F10 (1:1) containing EGF (10–8m) as the only growth factor for 5 days. MK-PT cells designated as “EGF absent” were subjected to withdrawal of all soluble survival factors by incubation in DMEM:F10 (1:1) without any growth factors for the same time period. The culture medium was changed daily and replaced with fresh medium, either EGF-containing or EGF-free, as appropriate. After varying times of incubation, MK-PT cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and assessed immediately for viability (by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay) or snap-frozen at –70 °C for kinase assays or immunoblotting studies.MTT Assay for Viability—The number of remaining viable MK-PT cells was determined using a modification of the MTT assay, as previously described (13Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Triaca V.T. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F575-F585PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lieberthal W. Triaca V. Koh J.S. Pagano P.J. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F691-F702PubMed Google Scholar, 15Iglesias J. Abernethy V.E. Wang Z. Lieberthal W. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. Am. J.

After removing the growth medium, 200 μl of MTT dissolved in growth factor-free culture medium (1 mg/ml) was added to each well. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the MTT formazan crystals that formed were dissolved by adding 200 μl of 10% SDS in 0.01 n HCl. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, aliquots from each well were read using a microELISA plate reader with a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 650 nm. The viability of cells subjected to “EGF present” or “EGF absent” conditions for varying periods of time was expressed as a percentage of the viability of MK-PT cells determined by MTT assay on day zero.Antibodies—Akt was detected with polyclonal rabbit sera recognizing either the active Ser473-phosphorylated form of Akt or total Akt irrespective of its state of phosphorylation (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) were detected with polyclonal rabbit sera recognizing either the active Thr202- and Tyr204-phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 or total ERK1/2 irrespective of its state of phosphorylation (Cell Signaling Technology). Rsk kinase was detected with polyclonal rabbit sera recognizing either the active Thr359- and Ser363-phosphorylated form of Rsk (major reactivity to Rsk1 with cross-reactivity to Rsk3) or total Rsk irrespective of its state of phosphorylation (Cell Signaling Technology). Secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Activated Ser338-phosphorylated Raf1 was detected with a mouse IgG monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), whereas total Raf1 was detected with polyclonal rabbit serum (Upstate Biotechnology). PDK1 was detected with a murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody recognizing total PDK1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). c-Src was detected with purified polyclonal rabbit IgG recognizing total c-Src (Delta Biolabs, Campbell, CA).Immunoblotting Studies—At the end of the experimental period, MK-PT cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) per 50 ml). The vanadate was activated by pre-boiling for 10 min immediately before use. Cell lysates were incubated for 30–45 min on ice, then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was estimated by Bradford protein assay (Boston Bioproducts, Inc., Ashland, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Samples (25 μg each) were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer (Boston Bioproducts, Inc.) for 10 min and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 70 V for 80 min. All blots were probed first for the active, phosphorylated form of the kinase (Akt, ERK1/2, and Rsk). The blots were then stripped and reprobed for total kinase irrespective of phosphorylation.Immunoprecipitation Studies—Immunoprecipitation studies were performed as previously described (20Price V.E. Reed C.A. Lieberthal W. Schwartz J.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1152-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Dinha D. Wang Z. Price V.E. Schwartz J.H. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 284: F488-F497Google Scholar). In brief, protein G-agarose beads (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) were washed and suspended in “washing buffer” (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm pre-boiled sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet per 50 ml). The protein G-agarose beads were conjugated to either normal (non-immune) rabbit serum or to specific anti-kinase antibodies (anti-pan-ERK1/2 or anti-pan-Akt) by incubation with the appropriate rabbit serum or antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants of MK-PT cell lysates, prepared as for immunoblotting studies, containing equal amounts of protein, were pre-cleared by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the protein G-agarose beads conjugated to normal rabbit serum. These beads were then centrifuged at 4 °C at 4000 rpm, and the pre-cleared supernatant lysates were removed and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G-agarose beads conjugated to either pan-Akt or pan-ERK1/2 antibodies. After washing three times in “washing buffer,” entire immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and then probed with the appropriate antibody, using the same technique described for the immunoblotting studies.ERK1/2 and Raf-1 Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed as previously described (21Dinha D. Wang Z. Price V.E. Schwartz J.H. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 284: F488-F497Google Scholar). In brief, the in vitro kinase activities of ERK1/2 and Raf-1 were determined on immunoprecipitates of MK-PT cell lysates by use of radiolabeled kinase cascade assay kits obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., according to the manufacturer's specifications. Both assays measure phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. Myelin basic protein is a direct substrate for ERK1/2, whereas Raf1 induces the phosphorylation of MEK1 and ERK1/2. All intermediates and substrates were provided by the kits.RESULTSERK1/2 Activity Spontaneously Increases in MK-PT Cells Subjected to Withdrawal of All Soluble Survival Factors—Primary cultures of MK-PT cells undergo apoptosis upon withdrawal of all soluble growth or survival factors (13Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Triaca V.T. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F575-F585PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lieberthal W. Triaca V. Koh J.S. Pagano P.J. Levine J.S. Am. J.

Loss of viability occurs asynchronously over 7–10 days, leading to gradual loss of the monolayer. We examined the kinetics of ERK1/2 activity in two parallel sets of MK-PT cells. At confluence (t = 0), the cell medium was changed to medium (DMEM: F-12) that either contained EGF (“EGF present”) or did not contain EGF (“EGF absent”), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the culture medium we used was fully defined, EGF was the only soluble growth or survival factor present in the “EGF present” medium, whereas the “EGF absent” medium contained no growth factors.The level of active phosphorylated ERK1/2 was elevated at the start of the experiment (t = 0). Subsequently, despite the continuous presence of EGF, the level of active ERK1/2 decreased over the 5 days of observation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in MK-PT cells subjected to withdrawal of EGF, there was an abrupt fall in the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 after 24 h. However, by 2 days after EGF withdrawal, the level of active phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased again and remained elevated for the remainder of the 5 days of observation. Remarkably, levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in MK-PT cells that have been deprived of all survival factors are comparable to or greater than those found in MK-PT cells incubated in the presence of EGF (Fig. 1A, compare “EGF present” to “EGF absent”).We confirmed these results through two independent approaches. First, we measured the in vitro kinase activity of immunoprecipitated total ERK1/2. In MK-PT cells subjected to EGF withdrawal, there was an abrupt increase in ERK1/2 kinase activity by 24 h that remained elevated through 96 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, for MK-PT cells grown in the continuous presence of EGF, ERK1/2 kinase activity progressively declined (Fig. 1B). Thus, regardless of whether ERK1/2 activity was indirectly assessed by immunoblotting or directly by an in vitro kinase assay, MK-PT cells show a delayed but sustained increase in ERK1/2 activity in response to EGF withdrawal.We next examined the state of phosphorylation of the ribosomal kinase Rsk, a downstream target of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2). After EGF withdrawal, levels of phosphorylated Rsk increased progressively over time in parallel with those of ERK1/2. In the continuous presence of EGF, levels of phosphorylated Rsk remained more or less constant, in a pattern comparable to that of ERK1/2. Taken together, these results show that, following withdrawal of all soluble survival factors, ERK1/2 activity spontaneously increases over time and is capable of activating downstream targets.Fig. 2Rsk, a downstream target of ERK1/2, is spontaneously phosphorylated in MK-PT cells subjected to withdrawal of all soluble survival factors. MK-PT cells were cultured in the presence or absence of EGF. Total and phosphorylated Rsk were determined by immunoblotting at the indicated times. Shown is a representative blot from n = 4 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Spontaneous ERK1/2 Activity Inhibits Apoptosis of MK-PT Cells Undergoing EGF Withdrawal—To explore the consequences of the spontaneous activation of ERK1/2 in response to EGF withdrawal, we tested the effects of PD98059 (22Davies S.P.

https://openalex.org/W2068761963,"Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) participate in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume homeostasis and blood pressure. Channel activity is regulated by both extracellular and intracellular Na+. The down-regulation of ENaC activity by external Na+ is referred to as Na+ self-inhibition. We investigated the structural determinants of Na+ self-inhibition by expressing wild-type or mutant ENaCs in Xenopus oocytes and analyzing changes in whole-cell Na+ currents following a rapid increase of bath Na+ concentration. Our results indicated that wild-type mouse αβγENaC has intrinsic Na+ self-inhibition similar to that reported for human, rat, and Xenopus ENaCs. Mutations at His239 (γH239R, γH239D, and γH239C) in the extracellular loop of the γENaC subunit prevented Na+ self-inhibition whereas mutations of the corresponding His282 in αENaC (αH282D, αH282R, αH282W, and αH282C) significantly enhanced Na+ self-inhibition. These results suggest that these two histidine residues within the extracellular loops are crucial structural determinants for Na+ self-inhibition.

Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; ECL, extracellular loop; Po, open probability; Ki, inhibitory constant; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; ECL, extracellular loop; Po, open probability; Ki, inhibitory constant; WT, wild type. mediate Na+ transport across apical membranes of high resistance epithelial cells in the kidney, colon, and lung. The regulation of Na+ transport in collecting ducts has an important role in extracellular fluid volume homeostasis and in the control of blood pressure (1Rossier B.C. Pradervand S. Schild L. Hummler E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 877-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Alterations in the functional expression of this channel have been observed in association with several disorders, including inherited forms of hypertension (Liddle syndrome), volume depletion associated with hyperkalemia (pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1), and cystic fibrosis (2Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Hummler E. Curr. Hypertens. Rep. 2003; 5: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Three subunits (α, β, and γ ENaC) have been cloned from different species and are members of the ENaC/degenerin gene superfamily (4Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All three subunits participate in formation of the channel pore and share a similar membrane topology with two transmembrane domains (M1 and M2) that are connected by a large extracellular loop (ECL), and cytoplasmic N and C termini (5Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar).ENaC activity is regulated by a variety of extracellular and intracellular factors including hormones, proteases, other proteins, as well as monovalent and divalent cations (6Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, 7Schafer J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Na+ exerts two distinct types of inhibitory effects on ENaC activity: self-inhibition and feedback inhibition. The inhibitory effects of Na+ are distinguished by their sites of action, modes of action, and time course. Na+ self-inhibition was originally observed in studies of native epithelial tissues in the setting of a rapid increase in extracellular Na+ concentration (6Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, 8Fuchs W. Larsen E.H. Lindemann B. J. Physiol. 1977; 267: 137-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 9Li J.H. Lindemann B.

It is not dependent on Na+ influx, nor on intracellular Na+ concentration. On the other hand, increases in intracellular Na+ concentration result in feedback inhibition of ENaC (11Komwatana P. Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8107-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Komwatana P. Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr.

The latter is likely due to a reduction of channel density at the plasma membrane (2Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The inhibition of ENaC by extracellular or intracellular Na+ occurs on different time scales, and may have an important role in limiting increases in intracellular Na+ concentration and cell volume when cells are exposed to physiological conditions that would otherwise dramatically increase rates of cellular Na+ influx via ENaC (10Turnheim K. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 429-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Both Na+ self-inhibition and feedback inhibition contribute to the complex regulatory network that tightly controls ENaC activity.ENaCs cloned from human, rat, or Xenopus and expressed in Xenopus oocytes exhibit Na+ self-inhibition (15Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We previously reported that mouse ENaC (mENaC) is blocked by external Ni2+, and identified key extracellular His residues (αHis282 and γHis239) within conserved regions of the α- and γ-subunits that were required for channel block by Ni2+ (16Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As both Ni2+ and Na+ are extracellular inhibitors of ENaC, we speculated that extracellular regions that participate in Ni2+ block may also have a role in Na+ self-inhibition.We have examined whether specific residues within ENaC ECLs have a role in Na+ self-inhibition by comparing the inhibitory responses to external Na+ of wild-type and mutant mouse αβγENaCs in the oocyte expression system. Wild-type αβγ mENaC displayed typical Na+ self-inhibition. In contrast, we observed that Na+ self-inhibition was dramatically altered in channels containing mutations at either of two His residues within the extracellular loops of α and γ ENaC that dramatically decreased Ni2+ block. Channels with mutations of γHis239 showed no Na+ self-inhibition, whereas channels with a mutation of the corresponding His residue in the α-subunit (αHis282) showed enhanced Na+ self-inhibition.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—All ENaC clones used in this study were mouse ENaC subunits whose cDNAs were inserted into pBluescript SK-vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (17Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations were generated previously by a PCR-based method (16Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).ENaC Expression and Two Electrode Voltage Clamp—ENaC expression in Xenopus oocytes and two electrode voltage clamp were performed as previously reported (16Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Defoliculated oocytes were injected with 1–4 ng of cRNA for each mENaC subunit (per oocyte) and incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth’s saline (MBS, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.4). All experiments were performed 20–50 h following cRNA injections at room temperature (20–24 °C). Oocytes were placed in an oocyte recording chamber from Warner Instruments (Hamden, CT) and perfused with constant flow rate of 12–14 ml/min.Procedures for Observing Na+ Self-inhibition—To examine Na+ self-inhibition, a low Na+ bath solution (NaCl-1; containing 1 mm NaCl, 109 mm NMDG, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was replaced rapidly by a high Na+ bath solution (NaCl-110; containing 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) while the oocytes were continuously clamped to –60 mV (or –100 mV in some experiments). Bath solution exchange was performed with a 6-channel teflon valve perfusion system from Warner Instruments. At the end of the experiment, 10 μm amiloride was added to the bath to determine the amiloride-insensitive component of the whole cell current. Currents remaining in the presence of 10 μm amiloride were generally less than 200 nA. Results from oocytes that showed unusually large amiloride-insensitive currents (>5% of total currents) were discarded to minimize current contamination from endogenous channels and membrane leak. To ensure consistency, each batch of oocytes injected with wild-type or mutant ENaC cRNAs were examined in an alternating manner.The first 40 s of current decay was fitted with an exponential equation by Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments Inc.). The peak current (Ipeak) was the measured maximal inward current immediately after bath solution exchange from low Na+ to high Na+ concentration. The steady state current (Iss) represented the measured current at 40-s post-Ipeak. The current ratio of Iss/Ipeak was calculated from amiloride-sensitive Iss and Ipeak that were obtained by subtracting amiloride-insensitive currents from Iss and Ipeak.To estimate the Michaelis constants (Km) for Na+ concentration-current relationship, both Ipeak and Iss were measured in the same cell after the bath Na+ concentration was raised from 1 to 3, 10, 30, 60, and 110 mm and were normalized to their maximal values. The relative Ipeak and Iss were plotted against the Na+ concentrations. Km and Vmax (maximal relative current) were obtained by best fitting of the current-concentration data according to Equation 1 with least square non-linear curve fitting using Origin Pro 7.0 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). I=Vmax·C/(C+Km)(Eq. 1) In the above equation, I is the relative Ipeak or Iss and the C refers to the Na+ concentration used to initiate self-inhibition.We estimated the apparent inhibitory constant (Ki) of Na+ self-inhibition from the results of the above experiments. The ratios of Iss and Ipeak representing the amplitudes of self-inhibition at the different Na+ concentrations were plotted against the external Na+ concentrations. A Ki value was estimated from a best fitting of the data with Hill (Equation 2). ISS/Ipeak=Kin/(Cn+Kin)(Eq. 2) In Equation 2, C is the Na+ concentration and the n is the Hill coefficient.Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Significance comparisons between groups were performed with unpaired Student’s t tests. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically different.RESULTSNa+ Self-inhibition of αβγ mENaC—We examined Na+ self-inhibition of αβγ mENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes by tracking the current decay following a rapid increase in the extracellular Na+ concentration from 1 to 110 mm. The inward current measured at –60 mV quickly reached its maximal level (Ipeak) and then relaxed exponentially to a relatively steady level (Iss) (Fig. 1). Two parameters were used to describe the speed and amplitude of Na+ self-inhibition, the time constant (τ) for the current decline and the ratio of the steady state (Iss) to peak (Ipeak) whole cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ current. Current decay was observed with a time constant of 8.14 ± 0.38 s (n = 20) (Fig. 1). The ratio of steady state current to peak current was 0.66 ± 0.02 (n = 20). The time course and amplitude of the self-inhibition we observed in αβγ mENaC are comparable, though not identical, to those reported for human, rat and Xenopus αβγ ENaCs (15Chraibi A.

Na+ self-inhibition did not appear to exhibit voltage-dependence, as we observed similar responses at clamping voltages of –40, –60, –80, and –100 mV. 2S. Sheng, J. B. Bruns, and T. R. Kleyman, unpublished data. A similar self-inhibition response was seen in oocytes expressing different levels of currents, varying from –1 to –20 μA at a holding potential of –60 mV. The intracellular Na+ concentration did not significantly affect the speed or amplitude of Na+ self-inhibition, as the responses were similar in Na+-loaded oocytes that were incubated in 88 mm Na+ MBS and in oocytes that were kept in 10 mm Na+ MBS following cRNA injection. It has been reported that Na+ self-inhibition is not dependent on the current level, nor on intracellular Na+ concentration (15Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Substitutions of γHis239 within the Extracellular Loop Eliminated Na+ Self-inhibition—One of the peculiar features of ENaC architecture is that each subunit possesses a very large extracellular loop composed of about 450 residues. While its role in the regulation of channel activity is still unclear, recent studies suggest that the ECL may be involved in inhibitor binding (amiloride and Ni2+), channel gating, and subunit assembly and processing (19Ismailov II Kieber-Emmons T.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) recently reported that Ni2+ is an external inhibitor of ENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The αHis282 within this tract and the corresponding residue in the γ-subunit (γHis239) were identified as putative Ni2+ binding sites (16Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As both external Ni2+ and high concentrations of extracellular Na+ inhibit ENaC, we hypothesized that they might share a similar mechanism for their inhibitory effects on ENaC. This prompted us to examine the possibility that sites responsible for Ni2+ block may participate in Na+ self-inhibition. We examined Na+ self-inhibition of mutant mENaCs containing point mutations at either αH282 or γH239. To our surprise, Na+ self-inhibition was not observed in oocytes expressing αβγH239R, αβγH239D, or αβγH239C mENaC. As shown in Figs. 1C and 2, the currents reached their maximal level and essentially stayed at the same level, with minimal loss of current over a 1-min period.Fig. 2Mutations at γHis239 eliminated Na+ self-inhibition. Representative recordings from oocytes expressing αβγH239R (A), αβγH239D (B), or αβγH239C (C) mENaCs are shown. Identical responses of the whole cell currents to rapid increases in the external Na+ concentration were observed in at least 10 oocytes for each mutant. Open and gray bars indicate the time when the cells were bathed in 1 and 110 mm Na+ solutions, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutations of αHis282 Enhanced Na+ Self-inhibition—We observed that several αH282 mutants that were examined, including αH282D, αH282R, and αH282C, enhanced Na+ self-inhibition as shown by significantly smaller τ and Iss/Ipeak values than those of wild type (Fig. 3 and Table I). Although the response of αH282Wβγ mENaC was significantly faster than wild type, the Iss/Ipeak was similar to wild type (Fig. 3 and Table I).Fig. 3Mutations at αHis282 increased Na+ affinity for self-inhibition. Na+ self-inhibition was examined in individual oocytes expressing wild-type or mutant channels with extracellular Na+ concentrations of 110, 60, 30, 10, or 3 mm. A, recordings of current changes in response to the alterations of external Na+ concentration in oocytes expressing αβγ, αH282Dβγ, αH282Rβγ, αH282Wβγ, or αH282Cβγ, were representative of at least four experiments for each channel type. The short black lines above each trace indicate the periods of time when the cell was bathed in a 1 mm NaCl solution. The numbers below each current decay are the Na+ concentrations (in mm) used for inducing self-inhibition. B, relationship of the relative Ipeak and external Na+ concentrations.

Open table in a new tab To further characterize the enhanced Na+ self-inhibition by these mutations, we performed additional experiments to determine the apparent Na+ affinity of wild-type and mutant channels. We examined self-inhibition responses in a repetitive manner in the same oocyte, as the speed (τ) and extent of inhibition (Iss/Ipeak) remained constant, despite slowly decreasing overall whole cell Na+ currents, as has been reported by others (15Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The response of individual oocytes to acute increases in the concentration of external Na+ from 1 mm to 110, 60, 30, 10, and 3 mm was measured in order to estimate an apparent Na+ affinity for self-inhibition. As seen in Fig. 3A, the self-inhibition responses in wild-type channels were faster and deeper with 110 mm Na+ than with 60 or 30 mm Na+. When external Na+ was increased from 1 to 3 or 10 mm, no self-inhibition was observed. The estimated Ki for Na+ self-inhibition was 210 ± 19 mm (n = 6, Table II). These results are consistent with the notion that Na+ self-inhibition is a low affinity process (15Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the contrary, currents from oocytes expressing the mutant channels containing αH282D, αH282R, αH282W, or αH282C showed more rapid and deeper (except for αH282W) current relaxations than wild type with 110, 60, and 30 mm Na+. In addition, self-inhibition was apparent in oocytes expressing αH282Dβγ and αH282Rβγ when external Na+ was increased from 1 to 10 mm Na+. The estimated Ki values for αH282D, αH282R, and αH282C channels were 62, 76, and 87 mm, respectively, significantly lower than that of wild type.Table IIFitting parameters for the dose responses of Na+ self-inhibitionmENaCOocytesIpeakIssIssIssIss/IpeakKmKmKmKiKimmαβγ636.39 ± 6.8219.76 ± 3.3045.89 ± 7.12142.40 ± 21.83210.71 ± 18.91αH282Dβγ928.37 ± 3.037.55 ± 0.86aValues are p < 0.001 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.25.15 ± 3.51bValues are p < 0.05 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.85.66 ± 12.45bValues are p < 0.05 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.61.70 ± 6.21aValues are p < 0.001 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.αH282Rβγ638.48 ± 4.199.65 ± 1.42bValues are p < 0.05 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.40.53 ± 8.7276.92 ± 14.56bValues are p < 0.05 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.75.50 ± 4.45aValues are p < 0.001 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.αH282Cβγ547.75 ± 4.4813.23 ± 0.6690.18 ± 10.09cValues are p < 0.01 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.32.96 ± 4.00cValues are p < 0.01 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.87.14 ± 8.41aValues are p < 0.001 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.αH282Wβγ445.96 ± 6.2527.04 ± 5.05NDdNot determined.ND259.34 ± 153.51a Values are p < 0.001 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.b Values are p < 0.05 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.c Values are p < 0.01 from Student’s t test between WT(αβγ) and mutant channels.d Not determined. Open table in a new tab The relationships of the Ipeak and Iss versus Na+ concentration (greater than 1 mm) for wild-type channels were fit with the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1), generating an apparent Km for Na+ of 36 ± 7 mm and 20 ± 3 mm for Ipeak and Iss, respectively (Table II and Fig. 3, B and C). Peak current Km values of the αHis282 mutants were similar to wild type. However, αH282D and αH282R significantly reduced the apparent Iss Km. Curve fitting of Ipeak versus Na+ concentration with Equation 1 showed an average correlation coefficient of 0.979; whereas the fitting of Iss versus Na+ concentration was less satisfactory with an average correlation coefficient of 0.935 for wild type, and correlation coefficients of 0.822, 0.837, and 0.878 for mutant channels containing αH282D, αH282R, or αH282C, respectively. This poor fitting reflects reductions in whole cell currents observed with Na+ concentrations greater than 30 mm due to Na+ self-inhibition (Fig. 3C). As the response of these mutant channels to acute increases in external Na+ concentration appeared to be similar to substrate inhibition of an enzyme, we analyzed our data with Equation 3 that describes substrate inhibition (26Schulz A.R. Enzyme Kinetics: From Disease to Multienzyme Systems. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994: 38-41Google Scholar), Iss=Vmax·C/(Km+C+C2/Ki)(Eq. 3) where Ki is an inhibitory constant for Na+ that reflects Na+ self-inhibition. Curve fitting of Iss versus Na+ concentration with Equation 3 showed average correlation coefficients of greater than 0.97 for both wild-type and mutant channels. The estimated Ki values for wild-type and mutant channels (H282D, αH282R, and αH282C) with Equation 3 were comparable to those obtained by fitting the Iss/Ipeak data with Hill equation (see Equation 2 and see Table II). The results suggest that substitution of αHis282 with Asp, Arg, or Cys increased apparent affinity of Na+ for self-inhibition.The estimated Km values for channels containing mutations at γHis239 were in the range of 72 to 100 mm, much higher than that of wild-type ENaC. This observation suggested that current saturation of wild-type ENaC (particularly for Iss) at low Na+ concentrations was the result of Na+ self-inhibition.As mutations of αHis282 and γHis239 resulted in opposite effects on Na+ self-inhibition, we examined the self-inhibition response of a channel with mutations at both sites (αH282R-β-γH239R mENaC). Oocytes expressing these channels responded to an increase in the bath Na+ concentration from 1 to 110 mm with a"

Thus, CF epithelia fail to transport Cl- and water. A postulated therapeutic avenue in CF is activation of alternative Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels. We hypothesized that stimulation of Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space could trigger a sustained Ca2+ signal to activate Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels. Cytosolic [Ca2+]i was measured in non-polarized human CF (IB3-1) and non-CF (16HBE14o-) airway epithelial cells. Primary human CF and non-CF airway epithelial monolayers as well as Calu-3 monolayers were used to assess anion secretion. In vivo nasal potential difference measurements were performed in non-CF and two different CF mouse (ΔF508 homozygous and bitransgenic gut-corrected but lung-null) models. Zinc and ATP induced a sustained, reversible, and reproducible increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in CF and non-CF cells with chemistry and pharmacology most consistent with activation of P2X purinergic receptor channels. P2X purinergic receptor channel-mediated Ca2+ entry stimulated sustained Cl- and HCO3- secretion in CF and non-CF epithelial monolayers. In non-CF mice, zinc and ATP induced a significant Cl- secretory response similar to the effects of agonists that increase intracellular cAMP levels. More importantly, in both CF mouse models, Cl- permeability of nasal epithelia was restored in a sustained manner by zinc and ATP. These effects were reversible and reacquirable upon removal and readdition of agonists.

P2X purinergic receptor channel-mediated Ca2+ entry stimulated sustained Cl- and HCO3- secretion in CF and non-CF epithelial monolayers. In non-CF mice, zinc and ATP induced a significant Cl- secretory response similar to the effects of agonists that increase intracellular cAMP levels. More importantly, in both CF mouse models, Cl- permeability of nasal epithelia was restored in a sustained manner by zinc and ATP. These effects were reversible and reacquirable upon removal and readdition of agonists. Our data suggest that activation of P2X calcium entry channels may have profound therapeutic benefit for CF that is independent of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genotype.

Drumm M. Konstan M.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 1229-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), several approaches have been contemplated to control and cure CF in the lung and airways. They include introduction of the wild-type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, repair of mutated CFTR proteins, attenuation of airway inflammation, stimulation of Cl- channels alternative to CFTR, and/or inhibition of epithelial sodium channel-mediated Na+ hyperabsorption (2Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). While methods of gene and protein therapy are defined, pharmaco-logical intervention remains feasible in CF for dysregulated NaCl transport and airway inflammation (3Zeitlin P.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (4Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 165-171PubMed Google Scholar) have been proposed to substitute for cyclic AMP-dependent CFTR Cl- channels, offering a target for CF pharmacotherapy to rescue anion transport. An ideal therapeutic compound would ameliorate multiple defects in ion transport as well as quell airway inflammation. Increases in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) activate epithelial Cl- channels (2Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol.

Many laboratories have shown that stimulation of G protein-coupled P2Y nucleotide receptors increases [Ca2+]i derived from intracellular stores and may affect both ion transport mechanisms (2Kunzelmann K.

Although P2Y nucleotide receptors are currently a target for CF pharmacotherapy (6Kellerman D. Evans R. Mathews D. Shaffer C. Adv.

Our laboratory has shown that airway epithelia express another subclass of nucleotide receptors, the P2X receptor channels (P2XRs) (8Zsembery A. Boyce A.T. Liang L. Peti-Peterdi J. Bell P.D.

P2XRs function as extracellular ATP-gated, Ca2+-permeable, non-selective cation channels (8Zsembery A. Boyce A.T. Liang L. Peti-Peterdi J. Bell P.D. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol.

Recently we have reported that stimulation of airway epithelial P2XRs leads to sustained Ca2+ entry from extracellular stores (8Zsembery A. Boyce A.T. Liang L. Peti-Peterdi J. Bell P.D. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13398-13408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The magnitude and sustained nature of the [Ca2+]i increase was dependent on extracellular pH and the presence or absence of extracellular calcium, sodium, and zinc. Moreover the degree of alkaline pH potentiation of zinc and ATP stimulation and the lack of desensitization or inactivation of the receptor or channel properties was novel. In this study, we hypothesized that a combination of zinc and ATP could induce a prolonged Ca2+ signal that may rescue impaired Cl- secretion in CF airway epithelium in a sustained and reversible manner. Cell Cultures—IB3-1 cells 2Because all human cells and mice were handled by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Cystic Fibrosis Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham Cystic Fibrosis Center human subjects (assurance of compliance number M1149) and vertebrate animals (animal welfare assurance number A3255-01) protocols were followed. are CF human bronchial epithelial cells carrying two different mutations of the CFTR gene (ΔF508/W1282X) (13Zeitlin P.L.

Culture of these two cell lines has been described previously (15Tucker T.A. Varga K. Bebok Z. Zsembery A. McCarty N.A. Collawn J.F. Schwiebert E.M. Schwiebert L.M. Am. J.

Human airway epithelial cell monolayers (primary CF isolated from patients homozygous for ΔF508 mutations, primary non-CF, and immortalized Calu-3 cells) were grown in air/fluid interface culture on Costar 6.5-mm-diameter permeable filter supports in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented in a manner similar to the medium used for IB3-1 cells. Fura-2 Imaging and Quenching—Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was measured with dual excitation wavelength fluorescence microscopy after cells were loaded with the Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester as described previously in detail (8Zsembery A.

At the beginning of each experiment, cells were perfused with Ringer’s solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.3 adjusted with NaOH. The effects of hexokinase and apyrase solutions were tested in solutions containing 5 mm glucose. In all Na+-substituted solutions, N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) was used as a replacement cation. In NMDG-containing solutions, CaCl2 was raised to 3 mm, while MgCl2 was reduced to 0 mm, and external pH was adjusted with HCl. Fura-2 quenching experiments with MnCl2 were performed as described previously (8Zsembery A. Boyce A.T. Liang L. Peti-Peterdi J. Bell P.D. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13398-13408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cl- Permeability—Cells were loaded with 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium (2 mg/ml) fluorescent dye overnight. At the beginning of each experiment, cells were perfused with Ringer’s solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.3 adjusted with NaOH to establish a base-line fluorescence over 3 min. Then NMDG-containing solution (0 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, and 0 mm MgCl2) at pH 7.9 was added for 3 min followed by addition of zinc alone or with ATP. Effects of the agonists were tested in both Ca2+-free and Na+-containing medium. Specifics concerning the 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium assay and system have been published previously (16Braunstein G.M. Roman R.M Clancy J.P. Kudlow B.A. Taylor A.L. Shylonsky V.G. Jovov B. Peter K. Jilling T. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. Schwiebert L.M. Fitz J.G. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol.

Measurement of Transepithelial Anion Current—Primary cultures of human CF and non-CF as well as immortalized Calu-3 cells grown as monolayers on 6.5-mm collagen-coated permeable supports were studied as described previously (11Taylor A.L. Schwiebert L.M. Smith J.J. King C. Jones J.R. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Monolayers had electrical resistance at least 1,000 ohms/cm2. When HCO3-/CO2-free solutions were used, the apical side of the monolayers were bathed in a 140 mm NMDG- and 20 μm amiloride-containing solution with 3 mm CaCl2 and 0 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.9 (adjusted with gluconic acid). Basolaterally we added a 140 mm NaCl-containing solution with 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.3 (adjusted with NaOH). Both solutions contained 10 mm Hepes. In HCO3-/CO2-containing solutions, apical and basolateral solutions contained 125 mm NMDG, 25 mm choline-Cl- and 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaHCO3, respectively. Both solutions were gassed with 5% CO2. The pH of the apical solution was adjusted to 7.9 with gluconic acid. Concentrations of CaCl2 and MgCl2 were the same as described for HCO3-/CO2-free experiments. Measurement of Nasal Potential Difference (NPD)—A three-step protocol was used as described previously (11Taylor A.L. Schwiebert L.M. Smith J.J. King C. Jones J.R. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); however, the solutions were modified as below. First, the nasal cavity of anesthetized mice was perfused with Ringer’s solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, and 50 μm amiloride (pH 7.3 adjusted with NaOH). Second, we switched to low Cl--containing solution (6 mm) either in Na+- or NMDG-containing solution (pH was adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH and to 7.9 with gluconic acid, respectively). Third, zinc (40 μm) and ATP (100 μm) were added in Na+-free, NMDG-containing solution at pH 7.9. Because of the continuous presence of amiloride (50 μm) and the complete replacement of Na+ with a membrane-impermeant cation, NMDG (140 mm), in the perfusion solution, hyperpolarization reflects only Cl- secretion rather than cation absorption. Data Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and tested for significance using paired or unpaired Student’s t test with analysis of variance as appropriate. Results with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Values given in the text that refer to Δ[Ca2+]i or absolute [Ca2+]i refer to the sustained plateau of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration measured 5 min after peak stimulation except where noted. Extracellular Zinc and ATP Trigger a Sustained Increase in [Ca2+]i in CF and Non-CF Airway Epithelial Cells—Based on our previous observations (8Zsembery A. Boyce A.T. Liang L. Peti-Peterdi J. Bell P.D. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13398-13408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Taylor A.L. Schwiebert L.M. Smith J.J. King C. Jones J.R. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that combined stimulation of P2XRs by ATP and zinc in sodium-free medium at pH 7.9 could induce a more robust and sustained increase in cytosolic calcium than achieved previously (8Zsembery A. Boyce A.T. Liang L. Peti-Peterdi J. Bell P.D. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13398-13408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In IB3-1 cells, administration of ATP (100 μm) and ZnCl2 (20 μm) stimulated a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a sustained plateau (Fig. 1A). The plateau was markedly higher than basal [Ca2+]i (Δ[Ca2+]i = 317 ± 23 nm, n = 8). Similar results were also obtained in 16HBE14o- non-CF cells (Δ[Ca2+]i = 444 ± 28 nm, n = 6). The sustained Ca2+ plateau was abolished in the presence of 140 mm extracellular sodium (Δ[Ca2+]i = 32 ± 9nm, n = 4) (Fig. 1A) or by reducing external pH to 7.3 (Δ[Ca2+]i = 45 ± 7nm, n = 4) or 6.4 (Δ[Ca2+]i = 12 ± 5nm, n = 4) (Fig. 1B). Titration of external pH in a range of 7.9 to 7.4 revealed a gradual decrease in Ca2+ plateau levels, exhibiting the largest decline between pH 7.9 ([Ca2+]i = 383 ± 11 nm, n = 4) and pH 7.7 ([Ca2+]i = 135 ± 8 nm, n = 4) (Fig. 1C). Because external Mg2+ inhibits P2X4Rs (17Negulyaev Y.A. Markwardt F. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 279: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that removal of Mg2+ from the superfusion medium might further support Ca2+ entry mechanisms. In addition, we predicted that increasing external Ca2+ from 1.5 mm to 3 mm would enhance Ca2+ entry. Because our data show that ATP- and zinc-induced Ca2+ entry was potentiated in Mg2+-free and Ca2+-enriched medium (Fig. 1D), we studied Ca2+ entry under these ionic conditions (see below). Zinc Alone Is an Agonist for Ca2+ Entry in IB3-1 Cells—Zinc has been reported to trigger an increase in [Ca2+]i in many cell models (18Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Jan C.R. Wu S.N. Tseng C.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20McNulty T.J. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the effects of zinc alone on cytosolic [Ca2+]. Addition of ZnCl2 (20 μm) to Na+-free medium that was pH 7.9 increased [Ca2+]i (Δ[Ca2+]i = 312 ± 22 nm, n = 10) in a sustained manner (Fig. 2A) similar to that observed in combination with ATP (compare with Fig. 1A above). The Ca2+ plateau was abolished by removal of external Ca2+ (Δ[Ca2+]i = 11 ± 5nm, n = 4) (Fig. 2B), reducing external pH to 7.3 ([Ca2+]i was not significantly different from the basal value), or replenishment of 140 mm external Na+ (Δ[Ca2+]i = 10 ± 6 nm, n = 4) (Fig. 2C). To define the concentration range in which zinc stimulates sustained Ca2+ entry, we exposed IB3-1 cells to ZnCl2 in increasing concentrations from 2 to 200 μm. Significant stimulation was achieved at 10 μm (Δ[Ca2+]i = 187 ± 12 nm, n = 4) with maximal effects at 50 μm (Δ[Ca2+]i = 551 ± 42 nm, n = 4) (Fig. 2D). Although zinc alone caused robust Ca2+ entry from extracellular solution, we postulated that superfusion of cells might cause mechanically induced release of endogenous ATP that could act synergistically with exogenous zinc. Indeed elimination of ATP from the superfusion medium by ATP scavengers hexokinase (5 units/ml) and apyrase (1 unit/ml) caused a partial but not complete inhibition of zinc-induced Ca2+ entry (Δ[Ca2+]i = 312 ± 22 nm, n = 10 versus Δ[Ca2+]i hexok. + apyr. = 145 ± 15 nm, n = 4; p < 0.05). Interestingly, in Ca2+-free medium, zinc-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were transient (Δ[Ca2+]i peak = 123 ± 16 nm, n = 5) (Fig. 2E), an effect that was completely abolished by thapsigargin pretreatment (no significant changes in [Ca2+]i) (Fig. 2F). These data show that zinc increases [Ca2+]i from cytosolic calcium stores and extracellular solution. However, a sustained Ca2+ plateau was only observed when external calcium was present, suggesting that activation of Ca2+ entry mechanisms plays a key role in this prolonged Ca2+ signal. P2XR-independent Ca2+ Entry Pathways Are Not Involved in Zinc-induced Ca2+ Entry—Because Ca2+ entry was stimulated by zinc even in the absence of ATP, we were required to investigate whether P2XR-independent mechanisms were involved in this process. First, we assessed the effects of the zinc-activated cation channel inhibitor tubocurarine (21Davies P.A. Wang W. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 712-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) on zinc-induced Ca2+ entry. Tubocurarine (100 μm) had no effect on Ca2+ entry in IB3-1 cells (Δ[Ca2+]i = 282 ± 23 nm, n = 4) (Fig. 3A). We have shown previously that activation of the reverse operation mode of Na+/Ca2+ exchange did not contribute to ATP-induced Ca2+ entry in Na+-free solution (8Zsembery A. Boyce A.T. Liang L. Peti-Peterdi J. Bell P.D. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13398-13408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Zinc also inhibits Na+/Ca2+ exchange in rat brain (22Colvin R.A. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3091-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, we could not exclude the possibility that zinc might influence activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger under Na+-free experimental conditions. Thus, we tested the effects of KB-R7943, a selective inhibitor of the reverse operation mode of this exchanger. Surprisingly, instead of inhibition of zinc-induced Ca2+ entry, KB-R7943 (10 μm) potentiated zinc stimulation (Δ[Ca2+]i = 727 ± 51 nm, n = 4) (Fig. 3B). Store-operated Ca2+ channels play an important role in Ca2+ entry in non-excitable cells (23Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Uehara A. Yasukochi M. Imanaga I. Nishi M. Takeshima H.

Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Uehara A. Yasukochi M. Imanaga I. Nishi M. Takeshima H.

Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we tested its effects on thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry. At concentrations shown to activate sustained Ca2+ entry in human airway epithelial cells, zinc inhibited store-operated Ca2+ entry channels ([Ca2+]i = 685 ± 34 nm before and after zinc exposure versus [Ca2+]i = 94 ± 21 nm during zinc exposure, n = 5; p < 0.01) stimulated by thapsigargin depletion of intracellular endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores (Fig. 3C). Because zinc has been reported to modify the properties of Fura-2 (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we tested whether zinc enters the cells and affects Fura-2 when added at the concentration that induces sustained Ca2+ entry. Zinc did not change Fura-2 fluorescence until manganese was subsequently added, showing that zinc triggered Mn2+ entry and Mn2+-dependent Fura-2 quenching (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data show that P2XR-independent Ca2+ entry mechanisms are likely not involved in zinc-induced Ca2+ entry. Our previous results (8Zsembery A. Boyce A.T. Liang L. Peti-Peterdi J. Bell P.D. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13398-13408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the properties of zinc- or zinc and ATP-induced Ca2+ entry argue for a prominent role for P2X receptor Ca2+ entry channels. Zinc Alone or in Combination with ATP Restores Cl- Transport in IB3-1 Cells—To test the hypothesis whether a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ of greater than 300 nm could restore Cl- transport in IB3-1 CF cells grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips, we assessed Cl- efflux using 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium halide fluorescence assay. ZnCl2 (20 μm) alone or in combination with ATP (100 μm) stimulated Cl- efflux when administered in Na+-free alkaline (pH 7.9) medium (Fig. 4, A and B). These effects were dependent upon the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4A), suggesting a key role of Ca2+ entry mechanisms in stimulating Cl- transport. It is important to note that stimulation of Cl- efflux was achieved under the same conditions that resulted in a prolonged cytosolic Ca2+ increase. It is also probable that flow-induced release of endogenous ATP contributed to zinc-induced rescue of Cl- efflux in a manner similar to the Fura-2 imaging assays (see above). Zinc and ATP Stimulate Cl- Secretion in Polarized CF and Non-CF Human Airway Epithelial Cell Monolayers—We next tested the efficacy of zinc and ATP in rescuing transepithelial Cl- transport in primary human CF and non-CF airway epithelial cell monolayers as well as in Calu-3 immortalized human non-CF submucosal gland serous cell monolayers in Ussing chambers. In the presence of amiloride (20 μm) and a “basolateral toward apical” Cl- gradient, apical ATP (100 μm) and ZnCl2 (40 μm) in Na+-free solution (pH 7.9) stimulated transepithelial chloride current in both CF and non-CF airway epithelial cells (Fig. 5A). This Cl- current was biphasic, showing transient and sustained components (Fig. 5, A–D). Removal of the agonists abolished the sustained Cl- current, which was stimulated again upon readdition of agonists (Fig. 5B). Calu-3 cell monolayers are a preferred respiratory cell model system to study anion and water transport. It has been shown that forskolin-stimulated anion current is carried mainly by bicarbonate in these monolayers (29Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Lambert L.C. DeLuca A. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Furthermore Cuthbert et al. (30Cuthbert A.W. Supuran C.T. MacVinish L.J. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have recently reported that HCO3-/CO2 removal inhibits Cl- secretion in Calu-3 monolayers. Thus, we hypothesized that, in the presence of HCO3-/CO2, ATP and zinc could stimulate a more robust and sustained anion secretion than we observed in Hepes-buffered solution. Indeed, under these conditions, ATP (100 μm) and ZnCl2 (40 μm) elicited significantly higher peak (100.4 ± 10.0 μA/cm2, n = 5 versus 16.4 ± 1.2 μA/cm2, n = 18; p < 0.01) and sustained currents (76.6 ± 6.8 μA/cm2, n = 5 versus 12.0 ± 1.0 μA/cm2, n = 18; p < 0.01) (Fig. 5, B and D). The sustained current was inhibited by chelation of extracellular Ca2+, a maneuver that did not prevent the forskolin-stimulated anion secretion (Fig. 5D). These data show that zinc and ATP under optimal Ca2+ entry conditions stimulated sustained Cl- and/or HCO3- secretion in polarized CF and non-CF human airway and submucosal gland serous cell epithelia by a mechanism that, at least in part, requires extracellular Ca2+. Zinc and ATP Correct Defective Cl- Transport in NPD Assays of Mice—A critical test for these agonists and vehicle was the NPD assay in anesthetized mice (31Brady K.G. Kelley T.J. Drumm M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L1173-L1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We applied zinc and ATP onto the nasal mucosa of different strains of control and CF mice in the identical saline vehicle optimized for marked Ca2+ entry. In mice with at least one wild-type CFTR allele, the NPD depolarized with gradual decay in the presence of amiloride (50 μm). Under these conditions, reduction of mucosal [Cl-] caused significant hyperpolarization, indicating Cl- secretion by nasal epithelial cells (Table I and Fig. 6A). Addition of ZnCl2 (40 μm) and ATP (100 μm) induced further hyperpolarization that was sustained and indicative of Cl- secretion (Fig. 6A). This magnitude of hyperpolarization was as large as that elicited by isoproterenol stimulation of CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion in our studies (data not shown). The hyperpolarization was transient and markedly attenuated by removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Table I). We also tested this protocol in a ΔF508-CFTR homozygous CF mouse (32Zeiher B.G. Eichwald E. Zabner J. Smith J.J. Puga A.P. McCray Jr., P.B. Capecchi M.R. Welsh M.J. Thomas K.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2051-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and a bitransgenic mouse in which the lungs are null for CFTR but intestinal dysfunction was corrected with a fatty acid-binding protein promoter-driven CFTR construct. In the presence of amiloride (50 μm), reduction of mucosal Cl- was without effect (Fig. 6, B–F), illustrating the loss of Cl- permeability in CF. However, administration of ZnCl2 and ATP caused marked and sustained hyperpolarization in both CF models (Table I and Fig. 6, B–E). This degree of rescue of Cl- permeability and the sustained nature of this rescue are novel to the CF NPD field.Table ITransepithelial nasal potential difference values of control, Δ508 CF, and bitransgenic CF mice Starting points represent values (mV) obtained in Ringer’s solution containing amiloride immediately after the beginning of experiments.

TSC-36 was found to occur in two charge isoforms that differ in the extent of sialylation of otherwise identical N-linked, complex type oligosaccharides. Conformational analysis with both circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy showed a lack of significant structural changes upon calcium addition or depletion. This finding is in contrast to results obtained for several other BM-40 family members and indicates that the extracellular calcium-binding domain in TSC-36 is non-functional. The lack of conservation of important functional features common to several other members of the BM-40 family indicates that TSC-36, despite its sequence homology to BM-40, has evolved clearly distinct properties.

For several of the members the calcium-binding domain, comprising two EF-hands, has been shown to be functional and for BM-40 and SC-1 an affinity for collagens was shown, leading to an anchorage of these proteins in extracellular matrix structures (10Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Hambrock H.O. Nitsche D.P. Hansen U. Bruckner P. Maurer P. Hartmann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11351-11358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For BM-40 the binding was shown to be calcium-dependent, and a collagen-binding surface could be mapped on the EC domain. The many proposed functions of this protein family include inhibition of cell adhesion, influencing tumor invasion and metastasis, growth factor binding, and protease inhibition (12Bradshaw A.D. Sage E H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 13Nakada M. Yamada A. Takino T. Miyamori H. Takahashi T. Yamashita J. Sato H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8896-8902PubMed Google Scholar). TSC-36 is one of the family members with the least similarity to BM-40. The N-terminal region consists of only 12 amino acid residues, and the FS and EC domains are followed by a C-terminal domain with homology to the von Willebrand factor type C-like (VWC) domain. TSC-36 (TGF-β-stimulated clone 36) was first cloned as a TGF-β-induced protein from a mouse osteoblast cell line (1Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Mita A. Kuroki T. Nose K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It was shown that the expression of TSC-36 in fibroblasts could be suppressed through transfection with the oncogenes v-ras and v-myc, whereas v-src, v-raf, and v-abl did not have any influence (14Mashimo J. Maniwa R. Sugino H. Nose K. Cancer Lett. 1997; 113: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In aggressive, strongly proliferating lung cancer cells TSC-36 mRNA could not be demonstrated, and overexpression of TSC-36 in such cells had an antiproliferative effect (15Sumimoto K. Kurisaki A. Yamakawa N. Tsuchida K. Shimizu E. Sone S. Sugino H. Cancer Lett. 2000; 155: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By use of a subtractive cDNA library of non-transformed versus v-fos-transformed fibroblasts (FBR-v-fos), TSC-36 was shown to be down-regulated by v-fos and transfection of FBR-v-fos cells with TSC-36 inhibited their migration into Matrigel in an in vitro assay for tumor invasion (16Johnston I.M.P.

The orthologous proteins from rat, human, chick, Xenopus, and macaque have been cloned and sequenced (17Zwijsen A. Blockx H. van Arnheim W. Willems J. Fransen L. Devos K. Raymackers J.

The chick TSC-36 orthologue, also called Flik for follistatin-like, appears to play a role in mesodermal dorsalization, neural induction (18Patel K. Connolly D.J. Amthor H. Nose K. Cooke J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 327-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and in subsequent maintenance of midline sonic hedgehog signaling thus influencing axial patterning and forebrain development (21Towers P. Patel K. Withington S. Isaac A. Cooke J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 298-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in the chick embryo. It further influences somite compartmentalization and myogenesis (22Amthor H. Connolly D. Patel K. Brand-Saberi B. Wilkinson D.G. Cooke J. Christ B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 343-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have recombinantly expressed and characterized mouse TSC-36 with the purpose of comparing its properties to those of other members of the BM-40 protein family. In doing so we identified two charge isoforms that could be shown to differ in their sialylation pattern. Our work provides a molecular basis for further studies of TSC-36 function. Construction of Expression Vectors for Full-length and Truncated forms of TSC-36—The plasmid pGEM/36-A1 (1Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Mita A. Kuroki T. Nose K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was used to generate a full-length mouse TSC-36 cDNA, which encompasses the entire open reading frame but lacks the signal peptide, by PCR using the forward primer 1 (5′-GCCCCGCTAGCCCACGGCGAGGAGGAACC) and reverse primer 2 (5′-CAATGACTGCGGCCGCTTAGATCTCTTTGGTGTTCAC). The primers introduced new restriction sites (NheI and NotI) and a stop codon. The NheI/NotI-restricted PCR products were purified and inserted between the same restriction sites of pCEP-Pu-BM40 (23Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Sequencing revealed a 9-bp deletion (nucleotides 573-581) coding for the amino acids FLK. The deletion was corrected by replacing a EcoRI/NotI fragment with a corresponding 2-kb fragment from the pRcCMV/36 c1-2 containing the missing 9 bp. The corrected vector was subjected to a second PCR using the above-mentioned primers. This vector also served as a template to generate cDNA fragments representing the pair of EC-VWC domains and the EC domain using the following primers: forward primer 3 (5′-GCCCCGCTAGCCGTTGTCTGCTATCAAGCTAAC) and reverse primer 2 (see above) were used for the pair of EC-VWC domains and forward primer 3 (see above) and reverse primer 4 (5′-CAATGACTGCGGCCGCTTACTCAGGAGGGTTGAAGGAT) for the EC domain. The NheI/NotI-restricted PCR products were purified and, in the case of full-length TSC-36, inserted between the same restriction sites of pCEP-Pu-BM40 (23Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), to obtain the final expression vector pCEP-Pu-TSC-36. The cDNA fragments of EC-VWC and EC were cloned in the modified expression vector pCEP-Pu with an N-terminal tag consisting of six histidines, a myc epitope, and an enterokinase recognition site for cleavage of the tag (24Wuttke M. Müller S. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Hanisch F.-G. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36839-36848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), to obtain expression vectors pCEP-Pu-TSC-36-EC-VWC and pCEP-Pu-TSC-36-EC, respectively. The correct insertion and sequence of the inserts was verified by cycle sequencing of both strands using an ABI Prism 377 Automated Sequencer (PE Biosystems). Cell Culture and Transfection—The human embryonic kidney cell line EBNA-293 (Invitrogen), which constitutively expresses the EBNA-1 protein from Epstein-Barr virus, was used for transfection with pCEP-Pu-TSC-36, pCEP-Pu-TSC-36-EC-VWC, and pCEP-Pu-TSC-36-EC and selected with puromycin as described previously (23Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Conditioned serum-free media were collected 48 h after replacement of the serum-containing medium and stored at -80 °C. Purification of Full-length TSC-36 and Separation of TSC-36 A and B—Conditioned serum-free medium (4 liters) was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and passed over a DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in the same buffer at 4 °C. The column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient, and the recombinant protein eluted at 0.1-0.2 m NaCl. The TSC-36-containing fractions were dialyzed against 0.18 m ammonium sulfate in 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and applied to a C4-Butyl-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column that bound several contaminants. TSC-36 was found in the flowthrough and was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, concentrated on a DEAE-Sepharose FF column, and eluted with 0.3 m NaCl. Final purification was achieved by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The correct N-terminal sequence was confirmed by Edman degradation performed on a protein sequencer (model 473A, PE Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Separation of the two charge isoforms of TSC-36 was achieved by chromatography on a ResourceQ (Amersham Biosciences) column eluted with a non-linear NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Isoform A was eluted at 0.15 m and isoform B at 0.20 m NaCl. Purification of the EC-VWC Domain Pair—The serum-free medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and applied to a column with cobalt Talon Metal Affinity Matrix (Clontech). The EC-VWC protein eluted at a concentration of 50-130 mm imidazole and was dialyzed against 50 mm BisTris, pH 6.0, and applied to a ResourceQ column eluted with a non-linear NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Isoform A was eluted at 0.15 m and isoform B at 0.25 mm NaCl. Purification of the EC Domain—The serum-free medium was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, applied to a column with Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) for concentration, eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in the same buffer and was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The protein was applied to a column with cobalt Talon Metal Affinity Matrix (Clontech) in this buffer and eluted at a concentration of 20-50 mm imidazole. On non-reducing SDS-PAGE the preparation showed two diffuse bands, out of which the upper was sensitive to reduction, indicating dimerization due to incorrect disulfide bonding. The monomeric EC domain was separated from this contaminant by gel filtration on a column of Sephadex G50 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed according to the protocol of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco model 715 CD spectropolarimeter at 25 °C in thermostatted quartz cells of optical path length 1 mm. The molar ellipticity [θ] (expressed in degrees·cm2·dmol-1) was calculated on the basis of a mean residue molecular mass of 110 Da. The Ca2+ dependence of the CD spectrum was measured by addition of 2 mm CaCl2. Reversibility of the conformational change was tested by subsequent addition of 4 mm EDTA. A baseline with buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) was recorded separately and subtracted from each spectrum. Protein concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients of ϵ280 = 34,200 m-1 cm-1 for TSC-36, 32,320 m-1 cm-1 for the EC-VWC domain pair, and 23,590 m-1 cm-1 for the EC domain calculated according to Gill and von Hippel (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Emission Spectroscopy—Intrinsic fluorescence was measured with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer in 10-mm path length rectangular cells at 25 °C with excitation at 280 nm. Emission spectra for the full-length TSC-36, the EC-VWC domain pair, and the EC domain (each 1 μm) were recorded in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Spectra were also recorded with 2 mm CaCl2 in the same buffer and after addition of 4 mm EDTA. Mass Spectrometry—For determination of protein mass and N-glycan content purified proteins (20 pmol) were reduced with 0.5% mercaptoethanol and denatured by heating to 100 °C for 5 min. After denaturation, the proteins were incubated with 0.3 unit of N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per milligram in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, overnight at 37 °C. Digested and non-digested samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For analysis of potential truncations and N-glycosylation sites, proteins were further digested with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, 1:50 enzyme:substrate in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0) for 2-4 h at 37 °C and, after reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide, subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, the samples were dissolved in 5 μl of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI-MS was carried out in linear mode on a Bruker Reflex IV equipped with a video system, a nitrogen UV laser (λmax = 337 nm), and a HiMass detector. 1 μl of the sample solution was placed on the target, and 1 μl of a freshly prepared saturated solution of sinapinic acid in acetonitrile/H2O (2:1) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added. The spot was then recrystallized by addition of another 1 μl of acetonitrile/H2O (2:1), which resulted in a fine crystalline matrix. For recording of the spectra, an acceleration voltage of 20 kV was used and the detector voltage was adjusted to 1.9 kV. Approximately 500 single laser shots were summed into an accumulated spectrum. Calibration was carried out using the single and doubly protonated ion signal of bovine serum albumin for external calibration. Structural Analysis of N-Glycans—The N-linked oligosaccharides were released by treatment with N-glycosidase F, labeled with 2-aminobenzamide, digested with neuraminidase and other exoglycosidases, and analyzed by anion exchange or normal phase HPLC as previously described (24Wuttke M. Müller S. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Hanisch F.-G. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36839-36848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Antiserum Production—Recombinant TSC-36 was used to immunize rabbits. TSC-36 was covalently coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and specific antibodies were prepared by repeated passage of the antiserum over the affinity matrix and elution with 3 m KSCN in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Eluted antibodies were immediately dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Immunoblot Analysis of Cell Culture Media—Cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, bovine articular chondrocytes, and of several established cell lines were grown to confluency. Serum-free conditioned media, harvested 48 h after replacement of the serum-containing medium, were submitted to SDS-PAGE on 12% gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose and incubated with affinity-purified antibodies to TSC-36, followed by a swine anti-rabbit IgG coupled to peroxidase (DAKO). ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect peroxidase activity. Recombinant Production of Full-length and Truncated TSC-36 Proteins—We expressed TSC-36 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells to ensure proper folding and post-translational modification. In addition to the full-length protein we produced two truncated forms corresponding to the EC domain and the domain pair EC and VWC, respectively. For simplicity of purification, these truncated proteins were provided with an N-terminal His-Myc tag (24Wuttke M. Müller S. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Hanisch F.-G. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36839-36848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As a last step in the chromatographic purification of full-length TSC-36 from cell culture medium, the protein was applied to a ResourceQ ion exchanger in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Under those conditions the material eluted in two distinct peaks at 0.15 and 0.2 m NaCl, respectively, indicating a heterogeneity (Fig. 2A). Rechromatography of pools made from the first and second peak resulted in their elution in identical positions as in the initial run (Fig. 2, B and C), showing that they represent stable variants of TSC-36. Similarly, the protein EC-VWC eluted in two peaks when analyzed by chromatography on ResourceQ (not shown), after initial purification by affinity chromatography on a cobalt matrix, showing that the difference between the two isoforms, designated A and B, must reside in the domain pair EC-VWC. Because of low yields, the recombinant EC domain was not analyzed for heterogeneity in this manner. SDS-PAGE of the purified proteins (Fig. 3), performed under both reducing and non-reducing conditions, showed a major diffuse band for each sample, with TSC-36 A migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 45-51 kDa, TSC-36 B with 48-55 kDa, EC-VWC A with 42-48 kDa, and EC-VWC B with 45-50 kDa. A lower molecular mass component seen in the sample of EC-VWC B was by immunoblotting shown to represent a degradation fragment. The isolated EC domain appeared even more polydisperse than the other proteins and was seen as a smear in the region of 30 kDa. In each case the migration was considerably slower than expected from the molecular mass calculated from amino acid sequence, which indicated the presence of post-translational modifications and/or an abnormal electrophoretic behavior.Fig. 3SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and domain structure of TSC-36 derived proteins. A, SDS-PAGE of the purified recombinant proteins was performed on a 12% gel without (lanes 1-5) or with prior reduction with β-mercaptoethanol (lanes 6-10). The samples were full-length TSC-36 isoform A (lanes 1 and 6) and B (lanes 2 and 7), the EC-VWC domain pair isoform A (lanes 3 and 8) and B (lanes 4 and 9), and the EC domain (lanes 5 and 10).

For full-length TSC-36 and the EC-VWC domain pair, the measurements were made on pools containing both isoforms. No significant differences could be discerned between the spectra recorded in the presence of 2 mm calcium chloride and after addition of excess EDTA (Fig. 4). The spectrum for the full-length TSC-36 was typical for a protein with high α-helical content, with a minimum at 208 nm and a shoulder at 222 nm. The EC domain and the EC-VWC domain pair showed similar spectra, but with higher contents of β-sheet, indicating that β-structure predominates in the VWC domain (Table I).Table ISecondary structure of recombinant TSC-36 proteins calculated from circular dichroism spectraSecondary structureProteinsTSC-36 flEC-VWCEC%α-Helix29 (32)11 (11)22 (19)β-Sheet14 (10)38 (37)24 (24)β-Turns22 (28)19 (19)17 (22)Unordered structure35 (33)33 (33)33 (33)Total100 (103)101 (100)96 (98) Open table in a new tab The apparent lack of conformational changes upon removal of calcium indicated that the EC domain in TSC-36 may not be functional in calcium binding, but could also be due to that a change is too small or too local to be detected by circular dichroism spectroscopy. We therefore also measured intrinsic fluorescence at calcium saturation or depletion. The amino acid sequence of TSC-36 contains eight tyrosines and four tryptophans that are distributed between domains so that all three recombinant proteins are able to give signals in fluorescence spectroscopy. Only minor, non-reversible changes in fluorescence intensity were observed, again indicating a lack of calcium-dependent conformational changes (Fig. 4). Mass Spectrometry Analysis of TSC-36 and Its Post-translational Modifications—The mass of each of the recombinant TSC-36-derived proteins was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and compared with the theoretical mass calculated from the amino acid sequence (Table II). For each protein the measured mass was at least 20% higher than the calculated one, showing the presence of extensive post-translational modifications. The contribution of N-glycosidically linked glycans was determined by treatment of proteins with N-glycosidase F and renewed MALDI-TOF analysis of the deglycosylated products. The results showed that the bulk of the mass discrepancy was due to N-linked oligosaccharides and that both for the full-length TSC-36 and the EC-VWC domain pair the mass in N-linked glycans was higher in the more anionic B isoforms. Prediction of N-glycosylation sites using the NetNGlyc software indicated substitution of asparagines in positions 142, 173, 178, and 221, which all reside in the EC domain. Similar amounts of N-linked oligosaccharides were found in the full-length TSC-36 and the EC-VWC domain pair in good agreement with this prediction. However, the isolated EC fragment carried a lower glycosylation than the larger proteins, possibly due to the fact that Asn221 is only three amino acid residues from the C terminus of this fragment (Fig. 5). This N-glycosylation site may be less efficiently used when close to the artificial C terminus than in a larger protein containing also a VWC domain. In each case the mass after N-glycosidase F digestion was slightly higher than the theoretical one, possibly indicating the presence of additional, unidentified forms of post-translational modifications. Prediction of O-glycosylation with the NetOGlyc software indicated a possible substitution of the serines in position 101 and 105.Table IIMolecular masses of the recombinant TSC-36 proteins and their glycan portionsTSC-36 fl isoform ATSC-36 fl isoform BEC-VWC isoform AEC-VWC isoform BECMolecular masscalculated, Da33,00833,00827,64327,64318,979Molecular mass, Da42,310aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.41,880aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.35,387aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.37,985aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.25,023aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.Molecular mass after N-glycosidase F, Da33,828aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.33,467aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.28,148aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.28,168aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.19,688aValues were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans.Molecular mass of N-glycans, Da8,4828,4137,2399,8175,335a Values were experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the mass of N-glycans. Open table in a new tab To determine the potential usage of the four N-glycosylation and two O-glycosylation sites both isoforms of full-length TSC-36 were digested with trypsin, and the peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The identified peptides covered 86% of the amino acid residues in TSC-36 A and 80% of those in TSC-36 B (Fig. 5). The seven C-terminal residues could not be recovered, probably because of the presence of multiple trypsin cleavage sites in this region of the sequence, likely to result in very small fragments. Peptides spanning the regions of the protein corresponding to asparagines 142, 173, and 178 were missing in both isoforms, indicating that these N-glycosylation sites are used. On the other hand, peptides were found containing Asn221 and Ser101 and Ser105. This result does, however, not exclude that these sites are used in some of the protein molecules. The peptide Gly272-Lys281 was recovered only from the A isoform, but the two threonine residues at positions 275 and 277 in this peptide gave low scores in NetOGlyc and are unlikely to be substituted. Sialic Acid Content and Structure of TSC-36 N-Glycans—N-Glycans were enzymatically released from the A and B isoforms of TSC-36 and labeled with the fluorescent dye 2-aminobenzamide for detection. Sialo-structures were separated by anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 6), which revealed glycans with up to four sialic acid residues. The N-glycans from the TSC-36 B isoform had a significantly higher sialic acid content that those from the A isoform (Table III). The sialic acid residues could be efficiently removed from the isolated N-glycans by neuraminidase digestion (Fig. 6). When the neuraminidase was applied to the full-length TSC-36 A and B isoforms, these eluted at the exactly same position upon ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography on a ResourceQ column, indicating that differences in sialic acid content is the sole cause of the two charge isoforms (not shown).Table IIISialic acid composition of the N-glycan structures of TSC-36 isoforms A and BTSC-36 ATSC-36 B%Neutral N-glycansN020.011.0Monosialo N-glycansS141.331.9Disialo N-glycansS217.920.7Trisialo N-glycansS316.024.5Tetrasialo N-glycansS44.811.9 Open table in a new tab The neutral glycans obtained after treatment with neuraminidase were separated on a normal phase HPLC column, and the asialo- structures were identified by sequential digestion with different exoglycosidases (Fig. 7). The same glycan structures were obtained for both isoforms of TSC-36. These were three different completely galactosylated complex type oligosaccharides, all carrying a core fucose (Table IV). Both isoforms show the same composition of 18% biantennary (A2G2F), 23% triantennary (A3G3F), and 59% tetraantennary (A4G4F) complex type oligosaccharides. Therefore, the difference between the two isoforms is not due to different N-glycan structures but to variations in sialic acid content.Table IVAsialo N-glycan structures present in TSC-36 Open table in a new tab Analysis of TSC-36 Expressed by Primary Cells and by Established Cell Lines—An antiserum raised in rabbit against the full-length TSC-36 was affinity-purified by binding to the same antigen coupled to CNBr-Sepharose. The affinity-purified antibody did not show cross-reactivity with any known member of the BM-40 family (BM-40; testican-1, -2 and -3; SC1; and SMOC-1 and -2) when tested native in slot blots or in Western blot after SDS-PAGE (not shown). This antibody was used to determine the expression and N-linked glycosylation of TSC-36 in supernatants from primary chondrocytes and fibroblasts and from established cell lines of osteoblastic (MG-63) and fibroblastic (Wi-26) origins and to compare endogenous TSC-36 from these cells with the recombinant protein (Fig. 8). TSC-36 from these sources gave diffuse bands with mobilities similar but not identical to that of recombinant TSC-36. All samples were susceptible to digestion with N-glycosidase F, showing the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides, but the digested proteins still showed heterogeneity, running as one or two bands with differing mobility. Because the cell lines MG-63 and Wi-26 are both of human origin and the TSC-36 molecules produced showed clearly different mobilities after N-glycosidase F digestion, a heterogeneity must exist beyond that introduced by N-linked glycosylation. A broader screen of established cell lines was performed to determine cellular sources of TSC-36 (Fig. 9). TSC-36 was detected in the medium of all osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma cell lines tested. Cells of the fibroblast lineage gave variable results with HT1080 and Wi-26 being positive and L132 negative. The astrocyte cell line S6E and the glioma cell line C6 were strongly positive. The mammary carcinoma cell lines MDA MB-231 and ZR 75-1 gave moderately strong signals, whereas T47D and MCF-7 were negative. A large number of other epithelial or carcinoma cell lines were also negative. Among the positive cell lines were those of mouse, rat, and human origin, showing that the antibody detects TSC-36 from these three species. The TSC-36 forms produced by the different cell lines all migrated in the range of 45-55 kDa seen for recombinant murine TSC-36 expressed in 293 cells, with minor differences indicating a cell-type-specific variability in post-translational modification. A central aspect of our study was to determine if the homology in sequence and domain structure between TSC-36 and BM-40 is reflected in a similarity between the two proteins in structural and functional properties. A comparison of the two sequences showed the presence of two putative EF-hands in the TSC-36 sequence (27Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The first EF-hand in TSC-36 shows a deletion of one amino acid residue compared with the canonical EF-hand sequence, a feature that does not exclude a calcium affinity as demonstrated by the crystal structure of scallop myosin essential light chain (28Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichtling I. Sweet R.M. Kalabolis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The second EF-hand conforms to the consensus sequence. In an attempt to test the predicted calcium binding, recombinant TSC-36 and the proteins representing the EC-VWC domain pair and the EC domain were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy with and without addition of calcium and in the presence of surplus EDTA. For all three proteins calcium addition resulted in only marginal changes in the molar ellipticity and addition of EDTA resulted in a not significant reversal (Fig. 4, A-C). As circular dichroism spectroscopy did not give any indication of a calcium-induced conformational switch, the study was extended to measurement of fluorescence emission at calcium saturation and depletion (Fig. 4, D-F). Because of the favorable distribution of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the TSC-36 sequence, this method was expected to give sensitive detection of conformational changes. Despite this, no calcium-induced rearrangements could be detected in either of the three recombinant proteins. Therefore, we conclude that if calcium binding to TSC-36 occurs, this does not have any major consequences for the conformation of the protein. For comparison, when the same experiments were performed with human and murine BM-40 calcium addition gave significant increases in the proportion of α-helix, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy, and a 95% decrease in the intensity of the emitted fluorescence (29Engel J. Taylor W. Paulsson M. Sage H. Hogan B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6958-6965Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Maurer P. Mayer U. Bruch M. Jenö P. Mann K. Landwehr R. Engel J. Timpl R. Eur.

Biol. 1994; 238: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the case of Caenorhabditis elegans BM-40 neither of the spectroscopic methods gave any indication of calcium binding. C. elegans BM-40 lacks 23 amino acid residues in the EC domain, which encompass the α-helix B. It also contains an additional cysteine pair, which is predicted to form an additional disulfide bond, locking the EC domain in a more rigid structure (32Maurer P. Göhring W. Sasaki T. Mann K. Timpl R. Nischt R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TSC-36 shows a similar deletion of 31 amino acid residues, which even affects two α-helices, B and C, in the EC domain. During the purification of full-length TSC-36 and the EC-VWC domain pair by anion exchange chromatography we found that the recombinant proteins occur in two differently charged isoforms. In earlier studies of TSC-36 secreted by C6 glioma cells, a related heterogeneity was noticed by isoelectric focusing where TSC-36 showed a spectrum of isoelectric points ranging from 5.0 to 6.0 (17Zwijsen A. Blockx H. van Arnheim W. Willems J. Fransen L. Devos K. Raymackers J. Van de Voorde A. Slegers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We could conclusively show that this heterogeneity is due to differential sialylation (Table III) and that the two isoforms have an identical protein structure (Fig. 5) and the same oligosaccharide backbones in the same proportions (Table IV). Expression of TSC-36 was studied in primary chondrocytes and fibroblasts and in a variety of established cell lines of different origins (Figs. 8 and 9). All of these showed molecular masses for TSC-36 in the range of 45-55 kDa, when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, indicating that the high amount (more than 20%) of glycosylation seen for the recombinant proteins is likely to be representative for naturally occurring forms of TSC-36. The functional role of the high glycosylation and differential sialylation of TSC-36 remains unclear, but it is likely to make the protein strongly hydrophilic, and it may well affect its ligand interactions. We are grateful to Dr. Marcus Macht, University of Cologne, for his help and advice regarding mass spectrometry."

We examined the kinetics of fibrillogenesis using three techniques: the time dependence of the fluorescence emission of thioflavin T and 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate, circular dichroism measurements, and electron microscopy. We found that in the early stage of fibril formation, non-native apomyoglobin molecules containing β-structure elements aggregate to form a nucleus. Subsequently, more molecules aggregate around the nucleus, thereby resulting in fibril elongation. We evaluated by MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) the cytotoxicity of these aggregates at the early stage of fibril elongation versus mature fibrils and the wild-type protein. Similar to other amyloid-forming proteins, cell toxicity was not due to insoluble mature fibrils but rather to early pre-fibrillar aggregates. Propidium iodide uptake showed that cell toxicity is the result of altered membrane permeability. Phalloidin staining showed that membrane damage is not associated to an altered cell shape caused by changes in the cytoskeleton.

Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The transformation of soluble globular proteins into amyloid fibrils is closely associated with the so-called conformational diseases and is still not completely understood in physical terms (energetically and structurally). In amyloid fibrils, the structure of the polypeptide chain is dominated by hydrogen bonding between the atoms of the main chain that results in the formation of extended β-sheets rather than by the specific interactions of the side chains that govern the structures of globular proteins. Recently, studies have focused on the conformational state, i.e. the native, partially folded, and fully denatured state that precedes the formation of highly organized amyloid fibrils, in an attempt to understand the molecular events underlying protein aggregation.The formation of insoluble protein aggregates is associated with Alzheimer's disease, light chain amyloidosis, and familial amyloidosis (7Sunde M. Blake C.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), polyglutamine disorders, and Parkinson's disease (13Shastry B.S. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In these conditions, a specific peptide or protein that is normally soluble is deposited, either intact or in fragmented form, in insoluble fibrils that accumulate in one or more types of tissues. This process leads to fibrous aggregates constituted by extracellular amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and other intracytoplasmic or intranuclear inclusions.In vitro, a variety of proteins, apparently unrelated to any human disease, form fibrils that are indistinguishable from fibrils of patients affected by sporadic and familial amyloidosis (14Caughey B.

Even myoglobin, an all α-globular protein, forms fibrils containing β-strands under experimental conditions that favor the formation of partially folded states (20Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar).Experimental data indicate that some human genetic amyloid diseases are because of point mutations that cause incomplete protein folding, thereby increasing the propensity of the polypeptide chain to aggregate (21Chen C.D.

We previously demonstrated that the substitution of the two highly conserved tryptophanyl residues of myoglobin, i.e. Trp-7 and Trp-14, with phenylalanine results in the expression of a protein that does not undergo correct folding (23Sirangelo I. Tavassi S. Martelli P.L. Casadio R. Irace G. Eur. J.

Recent results suggest that the toxicity of amyloidogenic proteins lies not in the insoluble fibrils but rather in prefibrillar oligomeric intermediates that originate in the early stages of fibril formation (34Bucciantini M.

However, the accumulation of large quantities of aggregates may itself cause disease, particularly systemic non-neurological disorders (38Pepys M.B. Weatherall D.J. Ledingham J.G. Warrel D.A. Oxford Textbook of Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1995: 1512-1524Google Scholar). The toxicity of early aggregates has been attributed to their large exposed hydrophobic surfaces, which may inappropriately interact with a wide range of cellular components (34Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M.

The toxicity and cell damage induced by the structural states that form during fibrillation were also investigated. We found that the aggregation process involves a non-native conformational state different from the well characterized partially folded state of this protein (39Bismuto E. Sirangelo I. Irace G. Arch.

Finally, the cytotoxic effect is primarily caused by pre-fibrils interacting with the cell membrane and altering its permeability. However, this early damage does not seem to cause changes in the shape of the cytoskeleton indicative of cell death.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification—Wild-type and W7FW14F mutant myoglobin were expressed and purified essentially as described elsewhere (24Sirangelo I. Malmo C. Casillo M. Mezzogiorno A. Papa M. Irace G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45887-45891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain as N-terminal His-tagged forms and purified via affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The wild-type myoglobin was expressed in the soluble form and purified under native conditions. The heme was removed by the 2-butanone extraction procedure (45Teale F.W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The W7FW14F mutant was sequestered into insoluble inclusion bodies and purified under denaturing conditions. Refolding was achieved by removing denaturant by dialysis against 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 2.0, containing decreasing concentrations of urea. The pH of the protein solution was then adjusted at neutrality. This resulted in the formation of protein aggregates that were collected by centrifugation at 15000 × g for 10 min. Pre-fibrillar aggregates were collected immediately after neutralization of the protein sample, and mature fibrils were collected 7 days later. Protein concentration was determined under denaturing conditions, and absorption was measured at 280 and 275 nm for wild-type and mutant apomyoglobin, respectively. The molar extinction coefficients calculated from tryptophan and tyrosine content (46Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar) were ϵ280 = 13,500 m-1 cm-1 and ϵ275 = 3,750 m-1 cm-1.Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence was measured with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 55 spectrophotometer using cuvettes that have an optical path length of 1 cm. The temperature was maintained constant at 25 °C using an external bath circulator. ANS 1The abbreviations used are: ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ThT, thioflavin T; PI, propidium iodide; TBHP, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm, and emission spectra were measured from 410 to 600 nm (excitation and emission slit width = 3.5 nm). Protein concentration was 8 μm with an ANS/protein molar ratio of 1:2. ThT fluorescence was recorded from 460 to 500 nm with excitation at 450 nm and slits of 10 nm for excitation and emission. Protein concentration was 5 μm with a ThT/protein molar ratio of 5:1. For each sample, the fluorescence intensity at 482 nm was corrected by subtracting the emission intensity recorded before the protein was added to the ThT solution.Circular Dichroism Measurements—Far-UV CD activity was measured on homogeneous wild-type and W7FW14F apomyoglobin samples at a concentration of 10 μm. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled liquid system Neslab RTE-110. Cuvettes of 1-mm path length were used over the wavelength range between 250 and 200 nm. Spectral acquisition was taken at 0.2-nm intervals with a 4-s integration time and a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. An average of three scans was obtained for all of the spectra. Photomultiplier absorbance did not exceed 600 V in the spectral region analyzed. Data were corrected for buffer contributions and smoothed using the software provided by the manufacturer (System Software, version 1.00). All of the measurements were performed under nitrogen flow. The results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity [θ] in units of degree cm2 dmol-1. A mean residue weight of 115 was used for the peptide chromophore.Electron Microscopy—Fibril formation was monitored by electron microscopy to identify and characterize intermediate species appearing on the aggregation pathway. At time points of 4 and 12 h and 2, 4, 7, and 21 days, aliquots of 5 μl of protein were sampled from protein solution, deposited on colloidon-amyl-acetate-coated electron microscopy grids, and left to air-dry under germ-free conditions before being used for structural analysis. Samples were stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid for 30 s. Grids were blotted and again air-dried. Images were acquired with a Zeiss TM-109 electron microscope operating at an 80-kV excitation voltage.Cell Culture and Incubation with Protein Aggregates—NIH-3T3 cells (mouse fibroblasts, American Type Culture Collection) were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (Sigma) containing 10% bovine calf serum and 3.0 mm glutamine in a 5.0% CO2 humidified environment at 37 °C. 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin were added to the medium. Cells were used for a maximum of 20 passages. The cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/well on 12-well plates in 1 ml of fresh medium for MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and at a density of 30,000 cells on poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml) coated coverslips for propidium iodide uptake and phalloidin staining. 24 h after plating, the cell medium was exchanged with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum. Early aggregates and mature fibrils of W7FW14F apomyoglobin, suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red, were immediately added to cell media at ∼20 μm of final concentration. Cells incubated with culture medium without protein served as a control. A toxic control for propidium iodide uptake and phalloidin staining was obtained by adding tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) (Sigma) to the culture medium. Five separate experiments in triplicate were conducted for early aggregates, mature fibrils, and wild-type native folded apomyoglobin.MTT and Cell Death Assays—Cell-mediated reduction of MTT (Sigma) was assessed according to the method of Hansen et al. (47Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar). After 24 h of incubation with protein samples, cells were rinsed with PBS. 100 μl of a stock MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) were then added to 900 μl of culture medium/well, and incubation was continued for an additional 3 h. The medium was aspirated, and cells were treated with isopropyl alcohol-0.1 n HCl for 20 min. Levels of reduced MTT were determined by measuring the difference in absorbance at 570 and 690 nm. Cell death was assessed by the tryptan blue internalization test. After 24 h of incubation with protein samples, cells were treated with trypan blue and survival was quantified by counting (3 fields/well, 2 wells/condition, an average of 50 cells/field).Propidium Iodide Uptake and Phalloidin Staining—Slides from the different groups of cultures were fixed by immersing them for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After several washes, cells were stained with 600 μm propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS per 10 min. Cells were rinsed in PBS and then in 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 5 min, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate phalloidin (Sigma) conjugate diluted 1:1000 in PBS for 30 min and rinsed three times in PBS (5 min/wash). Cells were rinsed twice in distilled water and mounted cell side down with a drop of Vectashield mounting solution (Vectastain Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) on a microscope slide. Slides were preserved by sealing the edges of the coverslip and slide with clear nail polish. Propidium iodide uptake was monitored by fluorescence microscopy using a tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate filter and a Hamamatsu c4742-95 digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics Italia, Arese, Italy) and analyzed densitometrically using MCID Analysis, version 7.0 Image software (Imaging Research Inc. St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). Fields of 800,000 μm2 of cultures were analyzed. In each field, the elements ranging from levels between 1 and 120 in a 1024 gray level scale were defined as propidium iodide-positive nuclei. All of the cells were counted as the elements ranging from levels between 1 and 512 in the 1024 level gray scale.Phalloidin staining was used to evaluate cell shape. The elements were classified as normal or not on the basis of the form factor, which is a standard estimate of circularity that relates perimeter length to area. The more convoluted (and longer) the perimeter, the less circular the target. This measurement varies from 0 and 1 with 1 being a perfect circle. Cells with a form factor between 0 and 0.8 were classified as normal. Cells with a form factor between 0.8 and 1 were considered necrotic. Further separate propidium iodide and phalloidin staining and analysis were performed to confirm the results of some experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out with a paired two-sample Student's t test for the means ± S.D.RESULTSIn mildly acidic condition, i.e. pH 4.0, the W7FW14F apomyoglobin mutant adopts a soluble molten globule-like conformation similar to that of the wild-type protein (24Sirangelo I. Malmo C. Casillo M. Mezzogiorno A. Papa M. Irace G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45887-45891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this state, the A, G, and H helices are folded as in the native conformation, whereas the rest of the molecule is essentially unfolded (39Bismuto E. Sirangelo I. Irace G. Arch. Biochem.

We exploited the W7FW14F model to examine the mechanism and kinetics of fibril formation induced by raising the pH from mildly acidic to a neutral value and evaluated whether the structural states formed during fibrillogenesis affect cell viability.We evaluated the pH dependence of apomyoglobin aggregation and amyloid-like fibril formation by monitoring the fluorescence emission of two probes, ANS and ThT. We also measured far-UV CD activity to correlate fluorescence variations to structural modifications. ANS has been widely used in apomyoglobin studies since the discovery that native apomyoglobin binds ANS with high affinity in the site normally occupied by heme (48Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Upon binding, the quantum yield of the dye becomes 200-fold higher than in water and its fluorescence maximum shifts from 510 to 460 nm. ANS also binds to the partially folded molten globule-like species adopted by the protein when the pH is lowered from 7.0 to 4.0, although the binding site is different because of the unfolding of the heme region that occurs in the partially folded form (39Bismuto E. Sirangelo I. Irace G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 49Sirangelo I. Bismuto E. Tavassi S. Irace G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At pH 4.0, the emission of ANS is greatly reduced (75-80%) and shifted to longer wavelengths (39Bismuto E. Sirangelo I. Irace G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 49Sirangelo I. Bismuto E. Tavassi S. Irace G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ANS has also been used to study aggregation of non-native protein molecules such as the infectious scrapie agent (50Safar J. Roller P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8375-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 1, the emission intensity of the ANS-W7FW14F apomyoglobin complex at pH 4.0 peaked at 478 nm, which is very near that obtained with ANS bound to the partially folded species observed with the wild-type protein under the same experimental conditions (39Bismuto E. Sirangelo I. Irace G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 49Sirangelo I. Bismuto E. Tavassi S. Irace G. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At pH 6.5, the emission of ANS bound to W7FW14F decreased and there was a concomitant shift of the emission maximum toward longer wavelengths, i.e. the emission maximum of the fluorophore was practically the same as that of free ANS in water, i.e. 510-520 nm (39Bismuto E. Sirangelo I. Irace G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which indicates fluorophore release. Under the same experimental conditions, the pH increase determines an increase of emission intensity of the wild-type protein and a shift of the emission maximum from 478 to 460 nm, a value indicating restoration of the native structure of the heme site (39Bismuto E. Sirangelo I. Irace G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Fig. 2 shows the far-UV CD spectra of W7FW14F at pH 4.0, 5.0, and 6.5. At pH 4.0, the spectrum is typical of a polypeptide containing a significant amount of α-helical structure as indicated from the two characteristic minima at 208 and 222 nm. The analysis of CD data by Yang's algorithm (52Yang J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar) showed the following: helix 20.2, β 0, turn 34.5, and random 45.2 (24Sirangelo I. Malmo C. Casillo M. Mezzogiorno A. Papa M. Irace G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45887-45891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The pH increase from 4.0 to 5.0 dramatically changed the spectrum shape with a negative peak at 216 nm that is typical of a polypeptide-containing β-structure. A further pH increase caused a reduction of CD activity without substantially changing the spectrum shape.Fig. 2Far-UV circular dichroism spectra of theW7FW14F apomyoglobin mutant at pH 4.0 (continuous line), 5.0 (dotted line), and 6.5 (dashed line).

We examined ThT fluorescence emission in the presence of the W7FW14F apomyoglobin mutant at pH values from 4.0 to 7.0 (Fig. 3, lower panel). ThT fluorescence was unchanged at pH values between 4.0 and 6.0, whereas it dramatically increased between pH 6.0 and 6.5. There was no further increase at higher pH values. We then compared the pH dependence of ANS emission and CD activity with changes in ThT emission (Fig. 3, upper and middle panels). Decreased ANS fluorescence and CD activity clearly preceded increased ThT fluorescence, thus indicating that the structural changes probed by ANS and CD are not concomitant with those probed by ThT.Fig. 3The pH dependence of apomyoglobin aggregation monitored by ANS fluorescence (upper panel), molar ellipticity at 208 nm (middle panel), and ThT fluorescence (lower panel). The ANS fluorescence at 478 nm (▴) and emission maximum (•) were measured upon excitation at 350 nm. Protein concentration was 8 μm, and the ANS/protein molar ratio was 1:2. Molar ellipticity was monitored at 208 nm at 25 °C, and protein concentration was 10 μm. ThT emission was measured at 482 nm upon excitation at 450 nm immediately after pH adjustment. Protein concentration was 5 μm with a ThT/protein molar ratio of 1:5. Data were corrected for the emission intensity recorded before"

The TatA protein is the most abundant known Tat component and consists of a transmembrane segment followed by an amphipathic helix and a hydrophilic C terminus. To study the operation mechanism of the Tat apparatus, we analyzed the topology of TatA. Intriguingly, alkaline phosphatase (PhoA)-positive fusions were obtained at positions Gly-38, Lys-40, Asp-51, and Thr-53, which are all located at the cytoplasmic C terminus of the TatA protein. Interestingly, replacing phoA with uidA at Thr-53 led to positive β-glucuronidase fusion, implying cytoplasmic location of the TatA C terminus. To further determine cellular localization of the TatA C terminus, we deleted the phoA gene and left 46 exogenous residues, including the tobacco etch virus (Tev) protease cleavage site (Tcs) after Thr-53, yielding TatAT53::Tcs. Unlike the PhoA and UidA fusions, which abolished the TatA function, the TatAT53::Tcs construct was able to restore the growth of tatA mutants on the minimal trimethlyamine N-oxide media. In vitro and in vivo proteolysis assay showed that the Tcs site of TatAT53::Tcs was accessible from both the periplasm and cytoplasm, indicating a dual topology of the TatA C terminus. Importantly, growth conditions seemed to influence the protein level of TatA and the cytoplasmic accessibility of the Tcs site of TatAT53::Tcs. A function-linked change of the TatA topology is suggested, and its implication in protein transport is discussed.

TatA, TatB, and TatE share sequence homology at their N termini, including one transmembrane segment (TMS) 1The abbreviations used are: TMS, transmembrane segment; Kan, kanamycin; APH, amphipathic helix; Tcs, tobacco etch virus (Tev) protease cleavage site; TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide; Amp, ampicillin; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside; PhoA, alkaline phosphatase; UidA, β-glucuronidase. and an adjacent amphipathic helix (APH), whereas their C termini vary both in sequence and in length (5Chanal A. Santini C.-L. Wu L.-F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Expression studies suggest that tatE may be a cryptic gene duplication of tatA (6Jack R.L.

For the primary interaction TatC is both necessary and sufficient, whereas a subsequent association with TatB likely mediates transfer from TatC to the actual Tat pore (11Alami M. Luke I.

The purification of the different Tat complexes suggests that the Tat pathway utilizes multiple, transiently interacting complexes. Consistently, it has been shown that the thylakoidal TatC-TatB complex homologue, cpTatC-Hcf106, serves as precursor receptor and the TatA homologue, Tha4, assembles with cpTatC-Hcf106 complex during the translocation step (2Mori H.

Unlike the E. coli Tat system, the thylakoidal Tha4 has not been detected in the thylakoid Tat complex in the absence of ongoing substrate binding or translocation (2Mori H. Cline K. Biochim.

Biochemical and expression studies show that TatA is the most abundant component of the Tat system, present at an ∼20-fold molar excess over the TatB and TatC components (6Jack R.L. Sargent F.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Minimal functional units and key residues of TatA and TatB have been determined by genetic and molecular biology approaches (16Lee P.A. Buchanan G. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5871-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Barrett C.M. Mathers J.E. Robinson C.

C-terminal truncation analysis revealed that the transmembrane and amphipathic helical regions of TatA and TatB are critical for their function but that the C-terminal domains are not essential for Tat transport activity. Using site-specific mutagenesis to probe the significance of conserved features of the related TatA/B subunits leads to the conclusion that an apparent “hinge” region between the transmembrane segment and an APH is important in both proteins (17Barrett C.M. Mathers J.E. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Hicks M.G. de Leeuw E. Porcelli I. Buchanan G. Berks B.C. Palmer T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To gain further insight in the TatA function and the operation mechanism of the bacterial Tat translocase, we studied the topology of the Tat proteins. PhoA-positive fusions were obtained with TatA. In addition, PhoA and UidA fusions indicated that the TatA C terminus could be located both in the cytoplasm and in the periplasm. Moreover, we observed the influence of growth media on the intracellular level of TatA and TatC and on the cytoplasmic accessibility of the TatA C terminus. This finding strongly suggests dynamic topology changes of the Tat apparatus, which might be coupled to the translocation of folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media—All E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. The bacteria were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid medium, on LB plates, or in the minimal M9 medium (19Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Santini C.L. Wu L.-F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transposable element carrying the phoA-neo cassette was amplified by PCR using pmodTap as template and pmodFP (5′-attcaggctgcgcaactgt-3′) and pmodRP (5′-gtcagtgagcgaggaagcggaag-3′) as primers. The random in vitro transposition of the transposable element into p8737 was performed by using the EZ::TN transposase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Epicentre, Tebu). The transposition reaction product was then introduced by electroporation into CC118 strain. Blue (PhoA+) AmpR and KanR colonies were selected on agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (X-P, 40 μg/ml). Plasmids were prepared from these colonies, and Tn-PhoA insertion sites were determined by endonuclease digestion, PCR reaction, and DNA sequencing. The phoA-neo cassette was removed from pG41 with partial NotI digestion and self-ligation, yielding the plasmid pG41D (see Fig. 1). To construct p9913 (tatAT53-uidA), the phoA-neo cassette inserted at tatAT53 was replaced by the uidA-neo cassette by two steps of cloning. First, the NotI site in the multiple cloning sites of pG41D (tatAT53::Tcs) was removed with a XhoI-SalI double digestion and self-ligation, yielding p9910. The uidA-neo cassette was amplified by PCR using pmodTin as template and pmodFP-pmodRP as primers and cloned into the unique NotI site of p9910, resulting in p9913. Random substitution in the hinge region covering the residues from Gly-21 to Lys-24 of the TatA protein was constructed using gene splicing by an overlap extension protocol (21Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Briefly, two DNA fragments were amplified using pG41 as template in separate polymerase chain reactions with the oligonucleotide pairs BglIITatAup (5′-gaagatctcgatcccgcgaaattaatacgactc-3′) and TatAindown (5′-aaaaagcagtacaacgatgacggcaataatcaataa-3′) in one reaction, and TatAxup (5′-gttgtactgcttttt112322433431ctcggctcc-3′, where 1, 2, and 3 means 91.6%, respectively, of G, C, and A with 2.77% each of other 3 bases, and 4 represents 91.6% of A with 4.16% of G and 4.16% of C) and SstIITatBdw (5′-tccccgcggcctggcgtagttcatccatcg-3′) in another reaction. The two PCR products were then mixed, denatured, and re-annealed and used as template for another PCR by using BglIITatAup and SstIITatBdw as primers. The PCR products were digested by BglII and SstII, cloned into the corresponding sites of pG41, and used to transform CC118. Protein samples were prepared from a dozen of PhoA- colonies on LB-Amp plates, resolved on SDS-denaturing gels, and analyzed by immunoblot using antisera against PhoA. One of them contained intact TatAT53-PhoA fusion proteins. DNA sequencing revealed that the plasmid pG41K23I, contained an aa to tt nucleotide alteration leading to an isoleucine substitution for Lys-23. Enzyme Assays and Bioinformatics—Alkaline phosphatase and β-glucuronidase activities were assayed by the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate or p-nitrophenyl glucuronide, respectively. The absorption of the produced p-nitrophenol was measured at 410 nm with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer using a control without extract as the reference blank. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the release of 1 μmol of nitrophenol/min. Specific activity is expressed by unit/mg of protein. Spheroplast preparation and trypsin sensitivity assay were performed by using the protocol described by Tian and Beckwith (22Tian H. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In vitro Tev assays were performed on spheroplasts as described by Ehrmann et al. (23Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells expressing TatA containing a Tev protease cleavage site were cultivated on LB or M9 media. Harvested cells were washed once in proteolysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH8, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8) and concentrated to an A600 = 1 in the same buffer. For proteolysis, 5 mm dithiothreitol and 5 μl of Tev protease (50 units) were added to 45 μl of cells and incubated at 30 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting by using polyclonal antibodies against TatA or PhoA. Topology prediction of the TatA protein was carried out using the ExPaSy tools available at www.expasy.ch, and secondary structure predication was performed by using the PSIPRED program at bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk or the HNN program at npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr. Cellular Fractionation, Electrophoresis, and Immunoblot—Spheroplasts, cytoplasmic, periplasmic, and membrane fractions were prepared by lysozyme/EDTA/cold osmo-shock and ultracentrifugation, as described previously (24Rodrigue A. Chanal A. Beck K. Muller M. Wu L.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13223-13228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The protein samples resolved on SDS-denaturing gels by electrophoresis and immobilized onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were analyzed by immunoblot using the ECL+ method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Bioscience). The signals were quantified by using KODAK 1D image analysis software. Detection of Cellular Location of the TatA C Terminus by Using PhoA and UidA Fusions—Using an in vitro random Tn-PhoA transposition approach with p8737 ((tatABCD)+) as a target, a dozen of colonies showing a positive PhoA activity were obtained (20Gouffi K. Santini C.L. Wu L.-F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further mapping by endonuclease restriction enzyme digestion, polymerase chain reaction, and DNA-sequencing analysis revealed that four were in TatA after glycine 38 (TatAG38), lysine 40 (TatAK40), aspartate 51 (TatAD51), and threonine 53 (TatAT53) (Fig. 1B). The PhoA moiety gains its active form only if it is translocated into the periplasm and is, thus, widely used as a marker for studying membrane protein topology (25Manoil C. Mekalanos J.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 515-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the four TatA-PhoA fusions occurred all at the C terminus of TatA, which has been reported to be located in the cytoplasm (13Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Wallis R. van den Brink-van der Laan E. de Kruijff B. Wallace B.A. Palmer T. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13690-23697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed a series of experiments to check such a periplasmic location of the TatA C terminus. Enzyme assay showed that the specific activities of PhoA expressed from the TatAG38-PhoA, TatAK40-PhoA, TatAD51-PhoA, and TatAT53-PhoA fusions in CC118 (ΔphoA) were 433, 291, 71, and 62, respectively. These values were significantly higher than 1.1, a value obtained with the control plasmid pET22b+ in CC118. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis revealed that PhoA fusions were completely degraded when the spheroplasts were treated with trypsin (Fig. 2A1). Therefore, the TatA-PhoA fusions were indeed exposed to the periplasm. In the following experiments we chose to study TatAT53-PhoA and its derivatives alone for two reasons. First, they gave the strongest signal by immunoblot analysis using anti-TatA antisera. Second, Thr-53 is located downstream of the amphipathic helix that is essential for the TatA function (16Lee P.A. Buchanan G. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5871-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The E. coli TatA protein is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane via the amino-proximal transmembrane segment (13Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Wallis R. van den Brink-van der Laan E. de Kruijff B. Wallace B.A. Palmer T. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13690-23697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27De Leeuw E. Porcelli I. Sargent F. Palmer T. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To obtain a PhoA positive phenotype, the APH must adopt a membrane-span topology to place the TatA C terminus into the periplasm (see Fig. 4C2, see “Discussion”). The hinge region should be crucial for such topology and for the PhoA positive phenotype. To verify this hypothesis we introduced by PCR random substitution in the hinge region of TatA-PhoA fusion expressed from pG41. Altered plasmid pG41 was introduced into CC118 and the transformants obtained were screened for PhoA- phenotype. Crude extracts were prepared from six PhoA- colonies. TatAT53-PhoA fusion protein was detected by immunoblot in one of the strains (data not shown). DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the corresponding plasmid, pG41K23I, encoded TatAT53-PhoA fusion with a substitution of isoleucine for the lysine at position 23 in the hinge region of TatA (see “Experimental Procedures”). This mutation abolished the PhoA activity but did not affect the stability of the TatAT53-PhoA fusion protein, indicating that the PhoA moiety is blocked in the cytoplasm. This finding suggests that the lysine 23 is essential for the membrane span topology of the TatA amphipathic helix. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that changing residues in the hinge region of TatA leads to the defect in TMAO reductase export (17Barrett C.M. Mathers J.E. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Hicks M.G. de Leeuw E. Porcelli I. Buchanan G. Berks B.C. Palmer T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate further the topology of TatA, we replaced phoA by uidA and constructed the TatAT53-UidA fusion. The uidA gene encodes the β-glucuronidase, which is active in the cytoplasm and has been generally used to identify cytoplasmic located segment of membrane proteins (23Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The EZ4/p9913 (uidA-/tatAT53-uidA+) displayed a β-glucuronidase activity of 86 units, which was 30-fold higher than the basic level observed for the same mutant carrying the control plasmid p8737. Unlike the TatAT53-PhoA fusion, the TatAT53-UidA fusion was resistant to trypsin digestion in the spheroplast-trypsin sensitivity assay (Fig. 2A2 compared with 2A1). These results indicate a cytoplasmic location of the TatA C terminus of the TatAT53-UidA fusion. The PhoA- and UidA-positive phenotypes indicated that the TatA C terminus might exist in two different topologies. The requirement of the other Tat proteins for the periplasmic location of the PhoA moiety of the TatAT53-PhoA fusion was analyzed by measuring the PhoA activity in tat mutants. The ΔtatB, ΔtatC, and ΔtatABCDE mutations resulted in about a 3-fold decrease of the PhoA activity (Table II). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of the TatAT53-PhoA decreased in the tat mutants. In contrast, these mutations slightly increased the β-glucuronidase activity. Together these results would suggest that the presence of the TatB and TatC proteins would be more favorable for a periplasmic location of the TatA C terminus.Table IITatA-PhoA and TatA-UidA fusion activity in MC4100 and its tat mutant derivatives The bacteria were inoculated in LB-Amp media and incubated at 37 °C overnight.

Because both TatA-PhoA and TatA-UidA lost the TatA function (data not shown), we constructed another TatA derivative to analyze the topology of TatA under physiological conditions. The phoA and neo genes of pG41 were deleted by NotI digestion (Fig. 1C), and a fragment of 138 bp was left at the Tn5 insertion site (23Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The encoded 46 amino acids (see “Experimental Procedures”), containing a tobacco etch virus (Tev) protease cleavage site (Tcs), were thus inserted in-frame after Thr-53 (Fig. 1D), yielding pG41D encoding TatAT53::Tcs. The synthesis and cellular location of the TatAT53::Tcs were analyzed by immunoblot. The anti-TatA polyclonal antisera recognized TatA and, more weakly, an additional nonspecific polypeptide in the urea-washed membrane fractions prepared from the wild type strain carrying the plasmid p8737 ((tatABC)+) (Fig. 2B, lane 1). As anticipated, the TatA protein was absent from the ΔtatAE mutant, and the plasmid pG41D specifically directed the synthesis of a polypeptide bigger than TatA and with the size expected for TatAT53::Tcs in this mutant (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Both TatA and TatAT53::Tcs were detected in the membrane fractions of the ΔtatB and ΔtatC mutants carrying the plasmid pG41D (tatAT53::Tcs-(tatBC)+) (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, the plasmid pG41D (tatAT53::Tcs-(tatBC)+) was able to restore the growth defect of the ΔtatAE, ΔtatB, ΔtatC, and ΔtatABCDE mutants (Fig. 3A1) on minimal TMAO/glycerol liquid media. Therefore, TatAT53::Tcs preserves the TatA function, and the insertion of 138-bp in the tatA gene had no effect on the synthesis of the downstream TatB and TatC proteins, which was confirmed by immunoblot (data not shown). The cellular accessibility of the Tcs site within the physiologically active TatAT53::Tcs and of those located at the junction between TatAT53 and PhoA/UidA in the non-functional TatA-PhoA and TatA-UidA fusions was assessed by proteolysis and immunoblot analysis of cells grown in rich LB media. As anticipated, upon the treatment of the spheroplasts with exogenously provided Tev protease, the TatAT53-PhoA fusion was reduced to the size corresponding to the PhoA protein, implying the separation of the PhoA moieties from TatAT53 (Fig. 2C1, lane 3, compared with lane 2). Interestingly, when the spheroplasts were subjected to an in vitro Tev treatment the intensity of the TatAT53::Tcs band was significantly reduced (Fig. 2C2, lanes 3 versus 2). Notably, the nonspecific band in the Tev-treated fraction was stronger than that in the non-treated fraction. Therefore, the decrease of the TatAT53::Tcs intensity in the Tev-treated fraction could not be due to an uneven loading of the samples. Unlike the TatAT53-PhoA fusion, TatAT53::Tcs was not completely digested by the in vitro Tev treatment. These results would suggest that not all Tev cleavage sites in the TatAT53::Tcs are accessible from the periplasm and that the PhoA moiety of the TatA-PhoA fusion blocks the C terminus in the periplasm. To analyze the cytoplasmic accessibility of the Tev cleavage sites, we co-introduced pMM13 plasmid carryi"
https://openalex.org/W2078596128,"During mammalian spermiogenesis, histones are replaced by transition proteins, which are in turn replaced by protamines P1 and P2. P1 protamine contains a short arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain that is highly phosphorylated before being deposited into sperm chromatin and almost completely dephosphorylated during sperm maturation. We now demonstrate that, in elongating spermatids, this phosphorylation is required for the temporal association of P1 protamine with lamin B receptor (LBR), an inner nuclear membrane protein that also possesses a stretch of RS dipeptides at its nucleoplasmic NH2-terminal domain. Previous studies have shown that the cellular protein p32 also binds tightly to the unmodified RS domain of LBR. Extending those findings, we now present evidence that p32 prevents phosphorylation of LBR and furthermore that dissociation of this protein precedes P1 protamine association.

Our data suggest that docking of protamine 1 to the nuclear envelope is an important intermediate step in spermiogenesis and reveal a novel role for SR protein kinases and p32. The development of spermatids into spermatozoa, termed spermiogenesis, is characterized by the replacement of histones by the highly basic, arginine-rich, protamines (1Hecht N.B. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As a result of this exchange, the nucleosomal-type chromatin is transformed into a smooth fiber and compacted in a volume of about 5% of that of a somatic cell nucleus (2Meistrich M.L. Hnilica L. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 165-182Google Scholar, 3Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 296: 2176-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Although the exchange of chromatin proteins during spermiogenesis has long been known, the molecular mechanisms and the signaling pathways governing the histone to protamine transition have remained obscure. The deposition of protamines on sperm chromatin and the subsequent chromatin condensation appear to be controlled by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events. Protamines are highly phosphorylated, shortly after their synthesis and before binding to DNA, whereas they become largely dephosphorylated during sperm maturation (4Marushige Y. Marushige K.

Phosphorylation of P2 protamine has been shown to be essential, because deletion of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Camk4, which phosphorylates P2 protamine, impairs the replacement of transition protein-2 with P2 protamine, resulting in defective spermiogenesis and male sterility (9Wu J.Y. Ribar T.J. Cummings D.E. Burton K.A. McKnight G.S. Means A.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). On the other hand, all P1 protamines contain short arginine/serine-rich (RS) 1The abbreviations used are: RS, arginine/serine-rich; LBR, lamin B receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. domains that are efficiently phosphorylated by SRPK1 (SR protein kinase 1) (10Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of this modification is mostly unknown. In this respect, Biggiogera et al. (11Biggiogera M. Muller S. Courtens J.L. Fakan S. Romani M.G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1992; 20: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that protamines initially appear at the nuclear periphery, implying that the nuclear envelope might play a role in the replacement of transition proteins by protamines during spermiogenesis. Given that RS domains mediate protein-protein interactions (12Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to investigate the potential interaction of P1 protamine with the inner nuclear membrane protein lamin B receptor (LBR), which also possesses a repeat of RS dipeptides at its nucleoplasmic NH2-terminal domain. In the present study we demonstrate a direct association of these two proteins, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. SRPK1 was initially purified and cloned on the basis of its ability to phosphorylate and regulate the intracellular localization of SR splicing factors that commit precursor mRNA to splicing and promote spliceosome assembly (13Gui J.-F. Lane W.S. Fu X.-D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). A polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa (p32), isolated first as a protein tightly associated with the essential SR splicing factor ASF/SF2 (14Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), was shown to inactivate ASF/SF2 as both a splicing repressor and splicing enhancer protein (15Petersen-Mahrt S.K.

In this study we reinvestigated the significance of the p32-LBR interaction, presenting evidence that p32 prevents LBR phosphorylation and P1 protamine association with LBR. Immunofluorescence analysis suggests that dissociation of this protein precedes P1 protamine association in early spermiogenesis. Taken together our data provide some insights into the molecular machinery that spatially directs the histone to protamine transition, revealing a new role for SR protein kinases and p32. Plasmids, Expression of Proteins, and Antibodies—Human SRPK1, the wild-type NH2-terminal domain of LBR (GST-wtNt; amino acids 1-205), and a mutant form lacking the RS motifs (GST-ΔRS; lacks amino acids 75–84; 75RSRSRSRSRS84) were expressed as fusion proteins with GST using the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) (18Nikolakaki E.

Full-length SRPK1 was also subcloned into the p-FLAG-CMV-2 (Eastman Kodak) vector and expressed in 293T cells with a FLAG tag fused at its NH2 terminus (20Nikolakaki E. Kohen R. Hartmann A.M.

The purified, nonphosphorylated form of human protamine P1 was a generous gift from Philippe Chevaillier (Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, Université Paris-Val de Marne, 94010 Créteil, France). Recombinant p32 (kindly provided by G. Akusjärvi, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, S-75123 Uppsala, Sweden) was isolated as a His-tagged protein by standard nickel column chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The polyclonal anti-protamine 1 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide (MARYRCCRSKSRSRCR) corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence (residues 1–16) of mouse protamine 1. A rabbit anti-LBR polyclonal antibody raised against GST-wtNt was kindly provided by P. B. Singh (Division of Gene Expression and Development, The Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, UK), whereas the M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was a kind gift from G. Mosialos (Biomedical Sciences Research Center “Al. Fleming,” Vari, Attiki). The polyclonal antibodies against p32 and SRPK1 were previously characterized (17Simos G. Georgatos S.D.

Preparation of Testis Cytosolic and Nuclear Extracts—Testes from 5-month-old Wistar rats or C57 BL/6 mice were homogenized by means of a Potter-Elvehjem tissue homogenizer in 3 volumes of an ice-cold solution containing 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was passed through two layers of surgical gauze and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to yield a crude nuclear fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction (S100). The nuclei were further purified from the crude nuclear fraction by centrifugation through a cushion of 2.3 m sucrose at 100,000 × g for 90 min according to the method of Blobel and Potter (21Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and digested with 40 μg/ml DNase I for 30 min at room temperature. NaCl to a final concentration of 1 m was then added, and the mixture was further incubated at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotator. Nuclear extracts were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays—In vitro phosphorylation assays were carried out at 30 °C in a total volume of 25 μl containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), 2–3 μg of the appropriate substrate (bacterially expressed LBR or P1 protamine), and an aliquot of the enzyme as indicated. The samples were incubated for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 6 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. In situ kinase assays using rat testis cytosolic and nuclear extracts were performed as previously described (18Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), following essentially the protocol of Kameshita and Fujisawa (23Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). GST-wtNt was added to the separating gel at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml prior to polymerization. For control experiments GST-wtNt was replaced by 0.1 mg/ml GST. GST Pull-down Experiments—Incubation of GST, GST-wtNt, or GST-ΔRS (2–3 μg each) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads with purified P1 protamine (∼3 μg) or mouse testis nuclear extracts (∼300 μg of total protein) was performed in TNMT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100) in a total volume of 0.25 ml. The incubations were carried out for 60 min at room temperature. The beads were harvested, washed three times with TNMT, and resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer. Bound P1 protamine was analyzed on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. In the latter case a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used to visualize immunocomplexes by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Phosphorylation of GST-wtNt and/or P1 protamine was achieved by incubating the respective proteins with GST-SRPK1 (0.3 μg) or 293T cell extracts overexpressing FLAG-SRPK1 in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP for 3 h at 30 °C prior to immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose beads. His-tagged p32 was tested for binding to the GST fusion proteins following the same procedure. Incubation of the GST-wtNt/p32 complex immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads with phosphorylated P1 protamine (by GST-SRPK1 or 293T cell extracts overexpressing FLAG-SRPK1) was also performed in TNMT buffer as described previously. Bound P1 protamine was analyzed on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Incubation of GST-wtNt or the GST-wtNt/p32 complex immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads with rat testis cytosolic extracts (∼400 μg of total protein) or 293T cell extracts (∼200 μg of total protein) overexpressing FLAG-SRPK1 was performed in PBST (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in a total volume of 0.25 ml for 60 min at room temperature. Bound SRPK1 and FLAG-SRPK1 were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by Western blotting using the anti-SRPK1 polyclonal antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody or the M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat antimouse secondary antibody, respectively. In both cases, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium were used as substrates to visualize the immunocomplexes. In vitro phosphorylation assays of GST-wtNt by bound SRPK1 or FLAG-SRPK1 were performed on beads as described previously. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Mouse seminiferous tubule segments were isolated in sequential order after stages VII–VIII using the transillumination-assisted microdissection method (24Parvinen M. Vanha-Perttula T. Anat. Res. 1972; 174: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cells from the spermatogenic stages were spread onto polylysine-coated slides and allowed to adhere for 20 min at room temperature. The slides were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS containing 50 mm ammonium chloride, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After washing twice with PBS the slides were incubated for 45 min with the primary antibodies (diluted 1:100 in PBS), washed twice with PBS, and incubated for 30 min with the Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500 dilution in PBS). The immunostained samples were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride before being subjected to microscopy. The images were collected on a DMLB Leica microscope with an HBO 100-W lamp. SRPK1 Phosphorylates LBR and P1 Protamine in Testes—In a previous report, we have detected high levels of LBR kinase activity in testes (10Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This activity was found primarily in the cytosol (Fig. 1A; see also Ref. 10Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the cytosolic and nuclear kinase activities targeting LBR, from rat testes, were associated with the same enzyme, we performed in situ kinase assays in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, to which 0.1 mg/ml GST-wtNt (the wild-type nucleoplasmic NH2-terminal domain of LBR; amino acids 1–205) had been added immediately prior to gel polymerization. Fig. 1B shows that, in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions, a protein with a relative molecular mass of ∼97 kDa could modify LBR. This was specific because no labeling was detected when GST-wtNt was omitted from the gel or replaced by GST (data not shown). In a following step, GST-wtNt was incubated with rat testis cytosol and recovered by pull-down with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were then used for kinase reactions in the presence of radiolabeled ATP. Phosphorylation of the GST-wtNt protein, detected by autoradiography, suggested the existence of an LBR-associated kinase in testis cytosol (Fig. 1C, left panel). Furthermore, in a similar experiment the complexes recovered with glutathione-Sepharose beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-SRPK1 polyclonal antibody (20Nikolakaki E. Kohen R. Hartmann A.M. Stamm S. Georgatsou E. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40175-40182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C (right panel), the 97-kDa protein that could associate with LBR corresponded to the molecular mass of SRPK1. SRPK1 also phosphorylated efficiently protamine 1 (Fig. 1D; see also Ref. 10Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with SRPK1 being the major protamine 1 kinase, Ser8 and Ser10 (7RSQSRSR13) were previously identified as the phosphorylation sites of monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated human P1 protamine (6Chirat F. Arkhis A. Martinage A. Jaquinot M. Chevaillier P. Sautière P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation-mediated Association of P1 Protamine with LBR—Given that RS domains are well known for their bridging properties (12Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we set out to investigate the potential interaction of P1 protamine with LBR through their RS regions. To this end we tested the ability of purified P1 protamine to bind GST-wtNt and GST-ΔRS (the mutant form lacking the RS motifs; 75RSRSRSRSRS84). The complexes were recovered by pull-down with glutathione-Sepharose beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. As shown in Fig. 2, we were unable to detect any binding of unphosphorylated P1 protamine to the unphosphorylated NH2-terminal domain of LBR (lane 4). However, phosphorylation of P1 protamine by SRPK1 (either GST-SRPK1 or 293T cell extracts overexpressing FLAG-SRPK1) was able to promote its binding to the NH2-terminal domain of LBR (lane 5), whereas no such interaction was obtained with GST-ΔRS (lane 8), suggesting that the binding was confined to the RS domain of LBR. The highly basic character of both the NH2-terminal domain of LBR (pI = 10) and P1 protamine (pI > 11) and the fact that binding could still occur under stringent conditions (i.e. in the presence of 0.5 m salt) are in support of a high affinity and specific interaction. Surprisingly, unphosphorylated P1 protamine was unable to bind to the SRPK1-phosphorylated NH2-terminal domain of LBR (lane 6), leading to the conclusion that the phosphorylation of the two RS domains is not functionally equivalent. A minimal interaction was obtained when both RS regions were modified (lane 7). p32 Protein Prevents Association of both SRPK1 and Protamine 1 with LBR—A polypeptide with an apparent mass of 32 kDa (p32) was previously shown to associate both in vitro and in vivo with the NH2-terminal domain of LBR (16Simos G. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4027-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Simos G. Georgatos S.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Using in vitro binding assays with GST-wtNt and His-tagged p32, we confirmed the tight interaction between p32 and the RS dipeptides of LBR, only when the latter were unphosphorylated (Fig. 3A). Binding of His-p32 to GST-wtNt was saturable (Fig. 3B) and could still occur in the presence of 0.5 m salt, revealing a high affinity interaction. In this respect, it is noteworthy that p32 was unable to bind to P1 protamine under our assay conditions (data not shown), suggesting that the RS domain of LBR, although indispensable to p32 interaction, may not be sufficient. In favor of this hypothesis, p32 was reported to interact both with the RS domain and with the RNA-binding domain of ASF/SF2, a member of the SR family of splicing factors (15Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Estmer C. Öhrmalm C. Matthews D.A. Russel W.C. Akusjärvi G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Yu L. Lowernstein P.M. Zhang Z. Green M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3017-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because p32 interacts with the RS domain, it may also control the accessibility of LBR to SRPK1. To test this hypothesis GST-wtNt or GST-wtNt/p32 complexes immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 293T cell extracts overexpressing FLAG-SRPK1. The beads were then harvested, washed three times with PBST, and used for in vitro phosphorylation assays in the presence of radiolabeled ATP. Bound proteins were also analyzed by Western blotting, using the M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, binding of p32 completely inhibited binding of SRPK1 (left panel) and the subsequent phosphorylation of the NH2-terminal domain of LBR (right panel). In a following step, to examine whether p32 could also regulate the binding of phosphorylated protamine 1 to GST-wtNt, we performed pull-down assays using GST-wtNt/p32 complexes immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and phosphorylated P1 protamine. Analysis of bound P1 protamine on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining demonstrated that p32 protein prevented the binding of protamine 1 to LBR (Fig. 4B), suggesting that p32 actually competes with both P1 protamine and SRPK1 for the RS domain of LBR. The NH2-terminal Domain of LBR Pulls Down a Fraction of P1 Protamine and p32 from Testis Nuclear Extracts—To confirm the observed interactions between purified proteins, GST-wtNt immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with mouse testis nuclear extracts. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis of the proteins co-sedimenting with the beads showed that a fraction of protamine 1 was able to associate with GST-wtNt (Fig. 5A). The association of p32 could also be readily documented using the same pull-down approach (Fig. 5B). Temporal Perinuclear Localization of Protamine 1 and p32 during Mouse Spermiogenesis—To study in detail the distribution of LBR, protamine 1, and p32 during mouse spermiogenesis, several isolated spermiogenic cells during the elongation process were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy, and a representative analysis is shown in Fig. 6. At the beginning of the elongation process LBR exhibited a peripheral, nuclear envelope distribution (Fig. 6A, a-LBR). With progression of spermiogenesis, a polarization of the signal to one half of the nuclear periphery was apparent (Fig. 6, B and C, a-LBR). Finally, in elongated spermatids the signal was restricted mainly to the posterior pole of the nucleus (Fig. 6D, a-LBR). A similar redistribution was also observed with LAPs (lamina-associated polypeptides), which are also integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, and probably reflects the nuclear envelope remodeling during spermiogenesis (26Alsheimer M. Fecher E. Benavente R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2227-2234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protamine 1 exhibited the same peripheral, polarized distribution as LBR upon its appearance in the nucleus of elongating spermatids (Fig. 6B, compare a-LBR and a-P1). With progression of the elongation process nuclear labeling increased (Fig. 6C, a-P1), whereas in elongated spermatids the whole nucleus was labeled (Fig. 6D, a-P1), indicating the termination of P1 protamine deposition on sperm chromatin. The redistribution of p32 protein was impressive. p32 exhibited perinuclear localization, similarly to LBR, during the initial stages of the elongating process (Fig. 6A, a-p32). Concomitantly with the appearance of P1 protamine at the nuclear periphery, the perinuclear distribution of p32 was less apparent, and significant labeling of the central area of the nucleus could be observed (Fig. 6B, a-p32). The labeling became exclusively nuclear at a later stage of the elongation process with the first indications of acrosomal localization (Fig. 6C, a-p32), and finally p32 exhibited a clear acrosomal localization in elongated spermatids (Fig. 6D, a-p32). The acrosomal distribution of p32 has been also previously observed, during late spermiogenesis (27Soltys B.J. Kang D. Gupta R.S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 114: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), however without any indication of its potential function in this organelle. In the present study we demonstrated a direct association of LBR with protamine 1 only when the latter was phosphorylated by SRPK1. SRPK1 is predominantly expressed in testes, whereas it is present at low levels in almost all tissues (10Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization experiments (10Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Western blotting analysis (data not shown) revealed that SRPK1 is highly expressed in all spermatogenic cells except spermatozoa. The reason for the high level of expression of SRPK1 during the early stages of spermatogenesis may be due to the multiple functions associated with this kinase. SRPK1 was found to regulate through the phosphorylation of SR splicing factors constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing (13Gui J.-F. Lane W.S. Fu X.-D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) as well as export and translation of mRNAs (28Cáceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). 2J. F. Caceres, personal communication. Moreover, SRPK1 was able to mediate the uptake of polyamines through an as yet unidentified signaling pathway (29Erez O. Kahana C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Consistent with the diversity of roles displayed by SRPK1 during spermatogenesis, SPK-1 (the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of SRPK1) is required for germline development in C. elegans, including proliferation, maintenance, and gametogenesis (30Kuroyanagi H. Kimura T. Kazuhiro W. Hisamoto N. Matsumoto K. Hagiwara M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 99: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Postmeiotically, the beginning of spermiogenesis is characterized by a powerful wave of transcription, which is accompanied by high levels of splicing activity (3Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 296: 2176-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Splicing proceeds through phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles. Phosphorylation of SR splicing factors is essential for the spliceosome assembly, whereas their dephosphorylation is critical for the catalytic step after spliceosome formation (31Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The ASF/SF2 protein is one of the essential members of the SR family of splicing factors. p32 inhibits ASF/SF2 function as a splicing enhancer by preventing stable ASF/SF2 interaction with RNA and also by inhibiting ASF/SF2 phosphorylation by SR protein kinases (15Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Estmer C. Öhrmalm C. Matthews D.A. Russel W.C. Akusjärvi G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The sequestration of p32 at the nuclear periphery, via its association with LBR, would therefore allow splicing to proceed unimpaired in early haploid cells. Furthermore, the masking of the RS domain of LBR would prevent its phosphorylation and consequently would leave LBR ready to act as a “docking site” for the protamine 1 molecules. As spermiogenesis proceeds, histones are sequentially replaced by transition proteins and protamines, resulting in transcriptional silencing. P1 protamine is presumably phosphorylated in the cytoplasm, shortly after its synthesis, considering the predominant cytoplasmic localization of SRPK1 (Ref. 10Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and this study). The appearance of phosphorylated P1 protamine in the nucleus is well coordinated with the migration of p32 to the central area of the nucleus and the unmasking of the RS domain of LBR (for a model see Fig. 7). The nature of the event that triggers the dissociation of p32 from the RS domain of LBR still remains obscure. The association of P1 protamine with the nuclear envelope probably represents an important intermediate step prior to its deposition on sperm chromatin. One possibility is that certain layers of the transition protein-organized chromatin come close to the nuclear membrane, and the replacement takes place. Another possibility, not mutually exclusive, is that the nuclear envelope functions as a “working platform” where additional modifications (i.e. methylation) of protamine 1 take place. Those modifications may not only increase the affinity of protamine 1 for sperm DNA but may also recruit specific molecules, such as HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1), that have been shown to be coupled to chromatin condensation and transcriptional silencing (3Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 296: 2176-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 32Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The detachment of protamine 1 from the nuclear envelope and its binding to DNA are probably achieved through its dephosphorylation (Fig. 7). Consistent with this hypothesis, protamines were found mainly dephosphorylated in mature sperm chromatin (5Oliva R. Dixon G.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 25-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 6Chirat F. Arkhis A. Martinage A. Jaquinot M. Chevaillier P. Sautière P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As spermiogenesis proceeds, the nuclear envelope is sequestered mainly to the posterior pole (preimplantation fossa) of the nucleus (Ref. 26Alsheimer M. Fecher E. Benavente R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2227-2234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this study). Only this specialized region is associated with chromatin in mature sperm. Fractions of P1 protamine that still remain phosphorylated (6Chirat F. Arkhis A. Martinage A. Jaquinot M. Chevaillier P. Sautière P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) may be responsible for this type of interaction. Our data clearly show that an integral nuclear envelope protein plays a crucial role in the well orchestrated exchange of basic nuclear proteins during spermiogenesis. Deciphering the molecular machinery that regulates this process and directs it spatially is important, not only from the standpoint of cell biological interest but also for providing valuable insights of biomedical importance.

https://openalex.org/W1991073529,"To investigate structural requirement of helical apolipoprotein to phosphorylate and stabilize ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), synthetic peptides (Remaley, A. T., Thomas, F., Stonik, J. A., Demosky, S. J., Bark, S. E., Neufeld, E. B., Bocharov, A. V., Vishnyakova, T. G., Patterson, A. P., Eggerman, T. L., Santamarina-Fojo, S., and Brewer, H. B. (2003) J. Lipid Res. 44, 828–836) were examined for these activities. L37pA, an l amino acid peptide that contains two class-A amphiphilic helices, and D37pA, the same peptide with all d amino acids, both removed cholesterol and phospholipid from differentiated THP-1 cells more than apolipoproteins (apos) A-I, A-II, and E. Both peptides also mediated lipid release from human fibroblasts WI-38 similar to apoA-I. L2D37pA, an l-peptide whose valine and tyrosine were replaced with d amino acids also promoted lipid release from WI-38 but less so with THP-1, whereas L3D37pA, in which alanine, lysine, and asparatic acid were replaced with d amino acids was ineffective in lipid release for both cell lines. ABCA1 protein in THP-1 and WT-38 was stabilized against proteolytic degradation by apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoE and by all the peptides tested except for L3D37pA, and ABCA1 phosphorylation closely correlated with its stabilization. The analysis of the relationship among these parameters indicated that removal of phospholipid triggers signals for phosphorylation and stabilization of ABCA1. We thus concluded that an amphiphilic helical motif is the minimum structural requirement for a protein to stabilize ABCA1 against proteolytic degradation. To investigate structural requirement of helical apolipoprotein to phosphorylate and stabilize ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), synthetic peptides (Remaley, A. T., Thomas, F., Stonik, J.

L37pA, an l amino acid peptide that contains two class-A amphiphilic helices, and D37pA, the same peptide with all d amino acids, both removed cholesterol and phospholipid from differentiated THP-1 cells more than apolipoproteins (apos) A-I, A-II, and E. Both peptides also mediated lipid release from human fibroblasts WI-38 similar to apoA-I. L2D37pA, an l-peptide whose valine and tyrosine were replaced with d amino acids also promoted lipid release from WI-38 but less so with THP-1, whereas L3D37pA, in which alanine, lysine, and asparatic acid were replaced with d amino acids was ineffective in lipid release for both cell lines. ABCA1 protein in THP-1 and WT-38 was stabilized against proteolytic degradation by apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoE and by all the peptides tested except for L3D37pA, and ABCA1 phosphorylation closely correlated with its stabilization. The analysis of the relationship among these parameters indicated that removal of phospholipid triggers signals for phosphorylation and stabilization of ABCA1. We thus concluded that an amphiphilic helical motif is the minimum structural requirement for a protein to stabilize ABCA1 against proteolytic degradation. Release of cellular cholesterol is one of the essential events of its homeostasis for the cells and also for the whole body, since cholesterol is catabolized only in the a few certain organs, mainly in the liver for the conversion to bile acids and in very limited amount in steroidogenic organs. This reaction is mediated by two distinct mechanisms: 1) nonspecific physicochemical exchange with cell surface and extracellular cholesterol acceptors and 2) by a specific mechanism for helical apolipoproteins such as apolipoprotein (apo) 1The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

It is therefore of clinical importance as it may influence this strong negative risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease. ABCA1 is degraded by calpain, and it appears to be one of the major mechanisms for regulation of its cellular level, and helical apolipoproteins protect ABCA1 against this degradation (8Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 9Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Helical apolipoproteins interact with ABCA1 and generate new HDL by removing cellular lipid, ABCA1 is phosphorylated and stabilized by a mechanism involving protein kinase C that is presumably activated by diacylglycerol generated by replenishment reaction for the removal of sphingomyeline (10Yamauchi Y. Hayashi M. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47890-47897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Stabilization of ABCA1 is observed not only with apoA-I but also with other apolipoproteins capable of lipid removal such as apoA-II or apoE (8Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 9Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the hypothesis that the removal of lipid triggers the signaling for ABCA1 stabilization rather than some other type apolipoprotein interaction with the cells. Synthetic peptides that mimic amphiphilic helical segments of apolipoproteins were demonstrated to reproduce the lipid removal reaction by apolipoproteins, indicating that structural requirement for apolipoproteins to carry out this reaction is not highly specific (11Mendez A.

Furthermore, both l and d stereoisomer forms of the peptides were equally efficient in promoting lipid release (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V.

This is similar to the structural requirements described for reactions of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (14Yokoyama S. Fukushima D. Kupferberg J.P. Kezdy F.J. Kaiser E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7333-7339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (15Ohnishi T. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5029-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we therefore examined the phosphorylation and stabilization of ABCA1 with series of synthetic peptides that mimic amphihphilic helical proteins (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 828-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, l or d stereoisomers, as well as peptides with a mixture of l and d amino acids were tested (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V.

The results are consistent with a model whereby peptides with an amphipathic helical structure that are competent in promoting lipid efflux from cells also promote the phosphorylation and stabilization of ABCA1. Materials—ApoA-I and apoA-II were isolated from HDL fraction prepared from fresh human plasma as described elsewhere (16Tajima S. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10073-10082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human apoE3 was a generous gift from Mitsubishi Pharma Corp. (Yokohama, Japan). ApoC-III was prepared from human plasma as described previously (17Jackson R.L. Holdsworth G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The L37pA peptide (DWLKAFYDKVAEKLKEAFPDWLKAFYDKVAEKLKEAF) was synthesized by a solid phase procedure as previously described with all l amino acids (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J.

Cellular Lipid Release—Human monocytic cell line cells, THP-1, differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 72 h (8Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and human lung fibroblasts, WI-38, pretreated with 9-cis-retinoic acid for 18 h, were maintained as described previously (10Yamauchi Y. Hayashi M. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47890-47897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Yamauchi Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with apolipoproteins or peptides for 24 h to induce the release of cellular lipid. Cholesterol and choline-phospholipid in the medium were measured by a respective enzymatic assay system (19Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Vance D.E. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11092-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Immunobloting, Pulse Labeleing, and Phosphorylation of ABCA1— The cells were incubated with apolipoproteins or peptides for 24 h, and ABCA1 in the cells was analyzed by immunoblotting by using an antibody against the C-terminal peptide of human ABCA1 according to a previous method (20Kojima K. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Murakami I. Suzumori K. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For estimation of the rate of decay of ABCA1, the cells were pulse labeled with 35S-labeled amino acids for 30 min and incubated with apolipoproteins or peptides prior to the analysis by electrophoresis-autoradiography of the immunoprecipitated fraction with the anti-ABCA1 antibody as described previously (8Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ABCA1 was examined by incubating the cells with apolipoproteins of peptides for 1 h in the presence of 32P prior to the analysis by electrophoresis-autoradiography of the fraction immunoprecipitated with the anti-ABCA1 antibody, as described previously (10Yamauchi Y. Hayashi M. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47890-47897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Lipid release was examined from differentiated THP-1 cells by apoA-I, apoA-II, apoE, and apoC-III and for the peptides L37pA, D37pA, L2D37pA, and L3D37pA (Fig. 1). ApoA-I, apoAII, and apoE showed similar lipid release activity on a per weight basis, with approximately a 1:1 mass ratio of cholesterol to choline-phospholipid. ApoC-III, however, exhibited only slight activity for lipid release. The peptide L37pA resulted in approximately a 4-fold more choline-phospholipid release and a 2-fold more cholesterol release compared with the apolipoproteins when used at the same protein mass concentration. Similarly, the D37pA peptide also promoted more cholesterol and phospholipid release than the apolipoproteins, although it was slightly less effective than the L37pA peptide. L2D37pA removed more lipid than apoC-III, but it was much less effective than the other apolipoproteins and the L37pA and D37pA. L3D37pA was completely ineffective in promoting lipid removal from cells, as described previously (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 828-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similar lipid release experiments were carried out with WI-38 cells (Fig. 2). This cell line releases relatively high amount of choline-phospholipid at base line without any apolipoproteins or any other “lipid acceptor” in the media (18Yamauchi Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that this is mostly due to lysophosphatidylcholine release (18Yamauchi Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike THP-1 cells, L37pA and D37pA showed similar lipid releasing activity to that by apoA-I. Furthermore, in contrast to THP-1 cells, L2D37pA also demonstrated equivalent capability of lipid removal compared with apoA-I, apoE, L37pA, and D37pA. L3D37pA, however, was incapable of removing lipid from either WI-38 cells (Fig. 2) or THP-1 cells (Fig. 1). ABCA1 in THP-1 cells was analyzed by immunobotting for its protein level, by protein pulse labeling for the rate of decay, and by using 32P labeling for monitoring its state of phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Increase in the protein level of ABCA1 was observed in differentiated THP-1 cells after treatment with apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoE, but not so by apoC-III. L37pA and D37pA also markedly increased ABCA1 protein level. L2D37pA appeard to be slightly less effective in stabilizing ABCA1, and L3D37pA had no effect on the ABCA1 protein levels. The increase of ABCA1 protein was parallel with retardation of its decay, as indicated by retention of radioactivity in the protein after pulse labeling of the cells with 32S-labeled amino acids. Thus, stabilization of ABCA1 by helical apolipoproteins was reproduced with the use of synthetic amphiphilic helical peptides that are also capable of removing cellular lipid. Phosphorylation of ABCA1 was enhanced by stimulating the cells with apoA-I, apoA-II, apoE, L37pA, and D37pA. ABCA1 in WI-38 was also analyzed in a similar manner (Fig. 4). Increase of ABCA1 was demonstrated with apoA-I, apoE, L37pA, D37pA, and L2D37pA, and also with apoC-III but to less extent. Phosphorylation of ABCA1 was also shown with these apolipoproteins and peptides. Neither protein increase nor phosphorylation of ABCA1 was observed with L3D37pA. Fig. 5 shows the extent of ABCA1 phosphorylation standardized by protein level for THP-1 and WI-38 cells.Fig. 4Analysis of ABCA1 in WI-38 cells. The cells were treated with apoA-I or with the indicated synthetic peptides, 10 μg/ml, for the analysis of cellular level and phosphorylation of ABCA1, in the same manner as the experiments for THP-1 cells described in the legend for Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Extent of phopshorylation of ABCA1 standardized for the protein level.

Data represents mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Relationships among the various measured parameters was analyzed in Figs. 6, 7, 8. Fig. 6 shows the extent of ABCA1 phopshorylation as a function of phospholipid release by various apolipoproteins and their model peptides. It appears that there is a threshold for the effect of phospholipids release on ABCA1 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of ABCA1 reaches a maximum at a phospholipid release of ∼2 μg/mg cell protein and increases no further, which is consistent with a model whereby removal of phospholipid is a trigger for signal transduction to phopshorylate ABCA1 (10Yamauchi Y. Hayashi M. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47890-47897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ABCA1 in WI-38 cells (Fig. 6) also increased with phospholipids release, and a similar threshold effect was demonstrated. It should be noted that apoC-III removed a significant amount of phospholipid from WI-38 cells and induced a maximum phosphorylation of ABCA1, while it was inefficient in both reactions in THP-1 cells. Fig. 7 shows the relationship between phospholipids release and ABCA1 protein levels. A direct positive correlation was observed between ABCA1 phosphorylation and ABCA1 protein level (Fig. 7). Finally, phospholipid release increased along with ABCA1 protein level, shown in Fig. 8.Fig. 7Relationship of ABCA1 protein level to the extent of phosphorylation of ABCA1. The data used in Fig. 5 were plotted for THP-1 cells and WI-38 cells.

The data used in this figure and the data in Figs. 1 and 2 are plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We thus conclude that structural requirement of apolipoprotein for removal of lipid to generate HDL is the presence of a stable type A amphiphilic helical segment (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 828-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and that this structural motif is also strongly associated with the potential of a protein to promote the phosphorylation and stabilization of ABCA1. There was, however, some interesting differences in the ability of the various peptides to promote lipid efflux from THP-1 cells and WI-38 cells (Figs. 1 and 2). The L37pA and D37pA peptides were more effective in lipid release in THP1 cells than apolipoproteins and the L2D37pA peptide. ApoA-I and L2D37pA peptide were previously shown to be completely dependent upon ABCA1 for lipid release, whereas L37pA and D37pA, because of their higher lipid affinity, are also able to promote lipid release without ABCA1 (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 828-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, possible a lower level of ABCA1 activity in THP1 cells compared with WI-38 cells could account for this difference. Alternatively, a difference in the lipid composition between THP-1 cells and WI-38 cells could also account for a greater amount of ABCA1-independent lipid efflux from the THP1 cells for the L37pA and D37pA peptides. Previously, it was shown in HeLa cells transfected with ABCA1 (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 828-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that there was not a stereo-selective interaction with synthetic amphiphilic helical peptides in the lipid release process, which is consistent with the equal amounts of lipid release observed for the l and d stereo-isomer forms of the 37pA peptide observed in WI-38 cells. It was consistently observed in this study, however, that the D37pA peptide was not as effective as the L37pA peptide for lipid release in THP1 cells. This suggests that there must be some sort of chiral interaction of the peptides with the THP1 cells, which could be with some other auxiliary protein besides ABCA1 to promote the cell interaction with the L37pA peptide and or in some other way to promote lipid release. In regard to the effect of the peptides on ABCA1 phosphorylation and ABCA1 protein stabilization, the two cell lines yielded similar results. Those peptides and apolipoprotiens that stimulated phospholipid efflux also promoted the phosphorylation of ABCA1 and its stabilization against degradation (Figs. 3 and 4). Because the 37pA peptides do not share any primary amino acid homology with any apolipoprotein (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 828-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), but do have type A amphiphilic helices mimicking apolipoproteins, ABCA1 phosphorylation and stabilization is unlikely to be the result of a specific interaction of the peptides or apolipoproteins with the ABCA1 transporter. This view is further supported by the observation that the l and d stereoisomer forms of the peptides were equally effective in promoting the phosphorylation and stabilization of ABCA1 (Figs. 3 and 4). A positive correlation was observed between phospholipid release and ABCA1 phosphorylation and stabilization (Figs. 6, 7, 8), which as proposed previously (10Yamauchi Y. Hayashi M. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47890-47897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggests that the release of phospholipid from cells provides the signal for ABCA1 phosphorylation and stabilization. Such a mechanism would provide an alternative means besides gene regulation for regulating the amount of functional ABCA1 transporter present in cells and for coupling the amount of ABCA1 in cells with the availability of HDL-apolipoproteins in extracellular fluid."
https://openalex.org/W1991613172,"Integrins are cell surface receptors for several microbial pathogens including echovirus 1 (EV1), a picornavirus. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the functional domain (α<sub>2</sub>I) of human α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin binds to a surface depression on the EV1 capsid. This three-dimensional structure of EV1 bound to α<sub>2</sub>I domain provides the first structural details of an integrin interacting with a picornavirus. The model indicates that α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin cannot simultaneously bind both EV1 and the physiological ligand collagen. Compared with collagen binding to the α<sub>2</sub>I domain, the virus binds with a 10-fold higher affinity but <i>in vitro</i> uncoating of EV1 was not observed as a result of attachment of α<sub>2</sub>I. A molecular model, constructed on the basis of the EV1-integrin complex, shows that multiple α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>1</sub> heterodimers can bind at adjacent sites around the virus 5-fold symmetry axes without steric hindrance. In agreement with this, virus attachment to α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin on the cell surface was found to result in integrin clustering, which can give rise to signaling and facilitate the initiation of the viral entry process that takes place via caveolae-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2077535486,"Replication forks often stall or collapse when they encounter a DNA lesion. Fork regression is part of several major paths to the repair of stalled forks, allowing nonmutagenic bypass of the lesion. We have shown previously that Escherichia coli RecA protein can promote extensive regression of a forked DNA substrate that mimics a possible structure of a replication fork stalled at a leading strand lesion. Using electron microscopy and gel electrophoresis, we demonstrate that another protein, E. coli RecG helicase, promotes extensive fork regression in the same system. The RecG-catalyzed fork regression is very efficient and faster than the RecA-promoted reaction (up to 240 bp s–1), despite very limited processivity of the RecG protein. The reaction is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis and is stimulated by single-stranded binding protein. The RecA- and RecG-promoted reactions are not synergistic. In fact, RecG functions poorly under the conditions optimal for the RecA reaction, and vice versa. When both RecA and RecG proteins are incubated with the DNA substrate, high RecG concentrations inhibit the RecA protein-promoted fork regression.

There are multiple pathways for repair of stalled replication forks, and these have recently become a major focus of research on bacterial DNA metabolism (3Cox M.M. Mutat. Res. Fund. Mol. Mech.

The process of fork regression could protect single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; kbp, kilobase pair(s); dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); SSB, single-stranded binding protein; MM, model molecule; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); gDNA, gapped DNA; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride. 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; kbp, kilobase pair(s); dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); SSB, single-stranded binding protein; MM, model molecule; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); gDNA, gapped DNA; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride. at the forks against degradation by nucleases (1Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). More importantly, fork regression allows repair or bypass of the lesion in a nonmutagenic process that can proceed without cleavage of pathway intermediates (7Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 9McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G.

The major stalled fork structure identified in two recent studies is one in which the leading strand has halted DNA synthesis at the site of a lesion, and lagging strand synthesis has continued for some distance (1 kbp or more) beyond that point (19Cordeiro-Stone M. Makhov A.M. Zaritskaya L.S. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Higuchi K. Katayama T. Iwai S. Hidaka M. Horiuchi T. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The resulting fork structure has a long single strand gap on the leading strand (Fig. 1A). Fork regression involves the reannealing of parental strands, coupled to the extrusion and annealing of daughter strands to eventually create a daughter strand duplex (Fig. 1A). Once regression has proceeded past the lesion and the daughter strand duplex is formed, the regressed structure constitutes a Holliday junction (Fig. 1A). The DNA lesion, now present within a duplex region, can be repaired by nucleotide or base excision repair. The ssDNA gap on the extruded daughter DNA could be filled in by a repair DNA polymerase. The reversed fork can then branch migrate in the opposite direction (fork progression) to reconstitute a structure leading to reassembly of a functional replication fork as originally proposed by Higgins (10Higgins N.P. Kato K. Strauss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). An important feature of this model is its avoidance of the DNA exchange events. In this sense, fork regression is not a true recombination event, even if proteins classically designated as recombination proteins are involved. Limiting the amount of DNA exchange in the chromosome may be beneficial to the cells, decreasing the probability of deleterious genomic rearrangements. DNA strand polarity is important in these reactions. The fork regression shown in Fig. 1A begins with a gap on the leading strand. It creates a Holliday junction with a short arm, and a 5′-single strand extension. The 3′ end can thus be used for the DNA polymerization alluded to above. If the gap in the starting molecule was instead on the lagging strand, it could in principle undergo a similar regression reaction. However, the final product would have a short arm with a 3′ single strand extension, and the enzymatic processing of this intermediate would be quite different as detailed by Michel and colleagues (1Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Replication fork regression can in principle be spontaneous or enzyme-driven. Positive torsional stress ahead of replication fork could cause fork regression (14Postow L. Ullsperger C. Keller R.W. Bustamante C. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 2790-2796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (191) Google Scholar), although it is difficult to evaluate how likely this process is in vivo where the chromosomal environment features numerous topoisomerases (21McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8235-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The alternative is to catalyze the regression reaction. Proteins that might actively promote fork regression in vivo include the RecA and RecG proteins. RecA, the central recombination protein in bacteria, operates as a DNA-bound filament that pairs and exchanges DNA strands. In vitro, RecA promotes strand exchange and strand invasion reactions that mimic its presumed roles in conjugational recombination and double strand break repair (18Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). RecA has also been implicated in the process of fork regression both genetically and biochemically. As demonstrated by Michel and co-workers (22Seigneur M. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), inactivation of the replicative helicase DnaB leads to the formation of cleavable Holliday junction intermediates (the products of regression) in a process that is RecA-dependent. Additionally, RecA protein promotes an extensive regression of a DNA structure mimicking a stalled fork, with a gap on the leading strand, in an in vitro system (12Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The RecA reaction documented in vivo (22Seigneur M. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) is distinct in terms of strand polarity to that studied in vitro (12Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the processes are complementary and both may occur (18Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli cells lacking RecA function are extremely sensitive to UV and ionizing radiation, reflecting the many roles of this protein in DNA repair and in the regulation of the SOS response (23Sargentini N.J. Smith K.C. Radiat. Res. 1986; 107: 58-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Smith K.C. Wang T.C. Bioessays. 1989; 10: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RecG protein is a very different enzymatic activity, an ATP-dependent helicase that binds and unwinds a variety of branched DNA substrates in vitro. The protein appears to act as a monomer (25McGlynn P. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2324-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The minimal DNA structure bound efficiently by RecG is a flayed-end duplex (Fig. 1B, structure a). However, RecG requires at least two duplex arms in a three-way DNA junction for efficient unwinding (Fig. 1B, structures b and c) (27Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19729-19739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). RecG binds and unwinds DNA forks with completely double-stranded (ds) DNA arms (Fig. 1B, structure d) (11McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 28McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41938-41944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in a reaction that mimics replication fork regression. RecG protein also promotes branch migration in Holliday junctions, the first activity reported for RecG (Fig. 1B, structure e) (27Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19729-19739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the case of DNA fork models with ssDNA arms, RecG protein binds and unwinds the fork structures with ssDNA leading arms (modeling a leading strand gap, Fig. 1B, structure b) more efficiently than forks with ssDNA lagging arms (Fig. 1B, structure c) (13McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30McGlynn P. Al D.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These results implicate RecG protein in regression of replication forks with leading strand gaps. All in vitro experiments demonstrating fork regression-like reactions in model structures with ssDNA arms used small forks assembled from synthetic oligonucleotides, creating arms that are 25–26 nt long and are heterologous to each other (13McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the case of RecG-mediated unwinding/branch migration of forks with no ssDNA gaps, the DNA substrates have been designed to permit a reaction encompassing from a few dozen (13McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) to a few hundred (11McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 28McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41938-41944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) base pairs. The crystal structure of Thermatoga maritima RecG protein bound to a fork containing a ssDNA leading arm gap (26Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) has been recently solved. The structure reveals a novel motif in the RecG protein, called a wedge domain, which seems to be involved in stripping the daughter strands from the parental strands, thus enabling regression of a replication fork. This structural information corroborates with biochemical evidence that suggests a novel and very interesting mechanism for RecG-promoted DNA unwinding (13McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Most helicases translocate on ssDNA until they find a duplex region to unwind (32Lohman T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). RecG helicase seems to translocate on dsDNA (31Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and bind the two arms of the fork in narrow grooves that run along the wedge domain. The presence in E. coli of two very different enzymes, RecA and RecG, that can both promote fork regression, leads directly to questions of whether the function of these enzymes in fork repair is complementary, redundant, or mutually exclusive. The phenotypes of recG mutants are complex, and implicate RecG in a range of reactions. RecG can either facilitate or prevent homologous recombination reactions in vivo. During conjugation, RecG promotes the formation of recombinant products in cells that lack the main Holliday junction processing system, RuvABC (33Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, RecG appears to reverse or disrupt recombination events in stationary phase cells (34Foster P.L. Trimarchi J.M. Maurer R.A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 25-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Harris R.S. Ross K.J. Rosenberg S.M. Genetics. 1996; 142: 681-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, purified RecG protein can catalyze migration of 3- or 4-way junctions like those in Fig. 1B toward the ends of the molecules, yielding non-recombinant linear products (36McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition to its action on DNA substrates, RecG removes R-loops in vivo and in vitro (37Fukuoh A. Iwasaki H. Ishioka K. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). RecG-mediated R-loop removal renders the recG gene essential for the viability of RNase H mutants (rnh), and recG inactivation triggers the use of R-loops as alternative replication initiation points, a phenomenon termed constitutive stable DNA replication (38Hong X. Cadwell G.W. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2385-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RecG protein is thus active on a multitude of branched nucleic acids: D-loops, R-loops, 4- and 3-way DNA junctions, and forked structures. This suggests that RecG plays multiple roles in vivo. The many potential roles of RecG are not reflected in the phenotype of recG null mutants, which exhibit only a modest sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (17Gregg A.V. McGlynn P. Jaktaji R.P. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 39Lloyd R.G. Buckman C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RecG protein may be active only under certain specific growth conditions, or other enzymes may promote reactions with overlapping functions. The processing of branched DNA structures is also mediated by the RuvABC system, and many recombination pathways can be delineated along RecG- or RuvAB-dependent lines. In contrast to recA mutants, cells lacking recG or ruvABC function are only mildly affected by UV irradiation (15Bolt E.L. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Gregg A.V. McGlynn P. Jaktaji R.P. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of ruvABC mutants are greater, suggesting that the ruv contribution to normal DNA metabolism is the more important one (15Bolt E.L. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Gregg A.V. McGlynn P. Jaktaji R.P. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recG and ruvABC mutations act synergistically in double mutants, producing cells with severe defects in repair similar to those seen in recA mutants (15Bolt E.L. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Gregg A.V. McGlynn P. Jaktaji R.P. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the recG and ruv act in different pathways. The fork repair pathways mediated by RuvABC also require the function of the RecBCD nuclease/helicase. If RecBCD is absent, the forks may be cleaved (1Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Repair pathways that include fork regression do not, in principle, require DNA cleavage (1Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 9McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G.

The recG gene is found at the distal end of an operon composed of four open reading frames, rpoZ, spoT, spoU, and recG (41Kalman M. Murphy H. Cashel M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 42Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6837-6843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rpoZ gene encodes the ω subunit of RNA polymerase. The spoT gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing either (p)ppGpp synthesis or hydrolysis (43Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Guanosine tetraphosphate and pentaphosphates (ppGpp and pppGpp) are two unusual nucleotides that accumulate during cellular amino acid starvation, as part of a process called the stringent response. SpoT modulates the steady state levels of (p)ppGpp in response to starvation conditions and modifications of the intracellular energy pool (reviewed in Ref. 44Chatterji D. Ojha A.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The spoU gene, immediately upstream of recG, encodes a protein of unknown function. Two promoters have been identified upstream of the spo operon and no obvious promoter sequence can be identified upstream of recG, suggesting that all four genes in the operon are co-expressed. Accordingly, an internal spoT deletion conferred a mild sensitivity to mitomycin C and UV irradiation, similar to that conferred by recG inactivation (41Kalman M. Murphy H. Cashel M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Increases in the cellular concentration of ppGpp or certain mutations in the β subunit of RNA polymerase greatly improve survival of cells lacking ruv function in a RecG-dependent fashion (11McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This suggests that RecG has an important role in the repair of forks that encounter stalled RNA polymerase complexes. When bacterial cells are starved, there is a transient induction of the SOS response that helps bring about the genome-wide hypermutation called adaptive mutation. Adaptive mutation requires both the lesion bypass DNA polymerase IV (the product of the SOS-induced dinB gene) and some recombination functions (45McKenzie G.J. Harris R.S. Lee P.L. Rosenberg S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 46McKenzie G.J. Lee P.L. Lombardo M.J. Hastings P.J. Rosenberg S.M. Mol.

During the stationary phase, the accumulation of adaptive mutations is stimulated in recG mutants, whereas it is suppressed in ruvABC mutants (34Foster P.L. Trimarchi J.M. Maurer R.A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 25-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Harris R.S. Ross K.J. Rosenberg S.M. Genetics. 1996; 142: 681-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation seen in recG mutants is largely explained by the increase in DNA polymerase IV observed in those strains, because of a partial induction of the SOS response seen when RecG function is not present (47Layton J.C. Foster P.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the increase in DNA polymerase IV is also dependent on RpoS (the stationary phase σ factor), and thus associated with the stationary phase (47Layton J.C. Foster P.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to investigate whether RecG protein can promote fork regression of a larger substrate that mimics a stalled replication fork with a ssDNA gap on the leading strand, and to compare any activity observed with that promoted by the RecA protein. We show here that RecG helicase can promote a very efficient fork regression reaction extending over more than 7 kbp. The reaction is at least 20 times faster than the RecA protein-promoted regression reaction, despite the fact that the enzyme has a very low processivity. When both RecA and RecG proteins are incubated with the substrate DNA, RecG exhibits an inhibitory effect on the RecA-promoted reaction, but only at relatively high RecG concentrations. Importantly, the two proteins promote the regression reaction under quite different sets of conditions, suggesting that these two proteins may play quite different situational roles in vivo.

SP-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (low sub), Sephacryl S-200 HR, and S-300 HR resins and the 5-ml HiTrap heparin column were from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Technologies (oligos 1M and 2M) or IDT (oligo 1C). DNA—Model DNA molecules (MM) were designed, prepared, and purified as previously described (12Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), with the following modifications in the purification procedures. Supercoiled ds M13mp8.32 DNA (7261 bp) (12Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The supercoiled DNA was then further purified by banding twice in cesium chloride. Linear dsDNA (5210 bp), gDNA (2051 nt gap, 7261 nt circle), and MM DNA with 6 mismatches at the branch were prepared as described (12Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and gel purified on 1% agarose gels. In the case of linear dsDNA (5210 bp) and gDNA, the DNA was visualized on a long wave UV transilluminator after staining with ethidium bromide and the bands corresponding to the DNA of interest were cut out with a scalpel. In the case of MM DNA, the purification gel was cut and only the part with the markers was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized on a long wave UV transilluminator. The band corresponding to the MM DNA marker was cut out, and then the unstained band of MM DNA forming the rest of the gel was also cut. The gel was stained then to ensure accurate and complete removal of MM DNA from the gel. The DNA was extracted from gel slices by electroelution in dialysis bags (SnakeSkin from Pierce, 7,000 molecular weight cutoff), typically for 5 h at 100 V, 4 °C, followed by concentration using C"
https://openalex.org/W2008810242,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) recently has been shown to activate MAP kinase (ERK1/2) in various cell types as well as in heterologous expression systems. In this study we show that the CaR agonist NPS R-467 (1 μm), which does not activate the CaR by itself, robustly activates ERK1/2 in the presence of a low concentration of Ca2+ (0.5 mm CaCl2) in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells permanently expressing the human CaR (HEK-hCaR). Ca2+ (4 mm) also activates ERK1/2 but with differing kinetics. CaR-dependent ERK1/2 activation begins to desensitize to 4 mm Ca2+ after 10 min, whereas there is no desensitization to NPS R-467/CaCl2 as late as 4 h. Moreover, recovery from desensitization occurs as rapidly as 30 min with 4 mm CaCl2. Pretreatment of HEK-hCaR cells with concanavalin A (250 μg/ml) to block CaR internalization completely eliminated the NPS R-467/CaCl2-mediated ERK1/2 activation but did not block the 2-min time point of 4 mm Ca2+-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Neither dominant-negative dynamin (K44A) nor dominant-negative β-arrestin inhibited ERK1/2 activation by either CaR agonist treatment, suggesting that CaR-elicited ERK1/2 signaling occurs via a dynamin-independent pathway. Pertussis toxin pretreatment partially attenuated the 4 mm Ca2+-ERK1/2 activation; this attenuated activity was completely restored by co-expression of the Gαi2 C351I but not Gαi1 C351I or Gαi3 C351I G proteins, PTX-insensitive G protein mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that both 4 mm Ca2+ and NPS R-467/CaCl2 activate ERK1/2 via distinguishable pathways in HEK-hCaR cells and may represent a nexus to differentially regulate differentiation versus proliferation via CaR activation.

The CaR is part of the GPCR family C, all of which have large extracellular domains responsible for ligand binding. Other class C GPCRs include the metabotropic glutamate receptors, γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptors, and a subset of pheromone, olfactory, and taste receptors. The CaR is activated by millimolar calcium (as well as some other cations such as Mg2+, Ba2+, Gd3+) and polyamines (e.g. spermine and neomycin) (12Brown E.M. Pollak M. Hebert S.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The CaR activates phospholipase C to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which mobilizes intracellular calcium stores to increase intracellular calcium (13Dutour A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 542-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The CaR-mediated phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C activation in parathryroid cells and HEK-hCaR has been reported to be pertussis toxin-insensitive and, therefore, Gq/11-mediated (14Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). The CaR also has been reported to activate K+ channels (15Brown E.M. Chattopadhyay N. Vassilev P.M. Hebert S.C. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 257-281PubMed Google Scholar) and produce a pertussis toxin-sensitive (Gi) inhibition of agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation in some cells (16Chattopadhyay N. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 759-768PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the CaR can couple to more than one population of G proteins. The mitogen-activated protein kinase, MAP kinase, pathways have been described to regulate a number of cell processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, oncogenetic transformation, and enzyme activity (17MacKenzie S.J. Baillie G.S. McPhee I. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16609-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) that are stimulated by agonist binding to GPCR and tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors as well as by mechanical stress in many cell types. The CaR has been shown to activate MAP kinases in a number of different cell types, including ERK1/2 in fibroblasts (18McNeil L. Hobson S. Nipper V. Rodland K.D. Am. J. Obstet.

Metab. 2003; 284: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ca2+-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 by way of the CaR has been reported to occur via both pertussis toxin-sensitive (Gi) and -insensitive (Gq/11) pathways (19Kifor O. MacLeod R.J. Diaz R. Bai M. Yamaguchi T. Yao T. Kifor I. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: 291-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the mechanisms and the physiologic outcomes differ depending on whether CaR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation is mediated via Gi or Gq/11. The CaR-specific agonist, NPS R-467, is a phenylalkylamine calcimimetic, which activates the CaR by allosterically increasing the affinity of the CaR for calcium (29Hammerland L.G. Garrett J.E. Hung B.C. Levinthal C. Nemeth E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1083-1088PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Van Wagenen B.C. DelMar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). It has been determined that the dose-response curve for the ability of calcium to activate down-stream signaling cascades (intracellular calcium mobilization, ERK1/2 activation) in cells expressing the CaR is shifted to the left at least 10-fold in the presence of NPS R-467 (31Rogers K.V. Dunn C.K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. Nemeth E.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: S483Google Scholar). Despite the fact that numerous reports in the past several years have described CaR-mediated ERK1/2 activation and responses in several cells, little is know about the kinetics and dynamics by which ERK1/2 activation occurs. Furthermore, most have used polyvalent cations as the agonist instead of specific calcimimetics such as NPS R-467 and NPS R-568. The present studies report the novel finding that the properties of CaR-mediated ERK1/2 activation in HEK-CaR cells differ depending on the ligand stimulating the GPCR, NPS R-467/CaCl2 or 4 mm Ca2+ alone. Our results show that high extracellular calcium causes ERK1/2 desensitization, whereas stimulation with NPS R-467 does not. We also demonstrate that, independent of the agonist, CaR-mediated ERK1/2 activation is dependent on receptor internalization, which occurs via a dynamin- and β-arrestin-independent mechanism. Furthermore, we show for the first time that Gαi2, but not Gαi1 or Gαi3, is responsible for the pertussis toxin-sensitive component of the 4 mm calcium-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Thus, there appears to be a unique pharmacology for activation of ERK1/2 by the CaR that might lead to unraveling the pleiotropic mechanisms for this signaling protein. Cell Culture—A clonal HEK-293 cell line stably expressing the human CaR (transfected with the cDNA for the human parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor) was kindly donated by NPS Pharmaceuticals. Cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen #11965-092) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.8 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen #25030-081), 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science #843555, 50 mg/ml), and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen #15140). The human wild-type and K44A dominant-negative dynamin I were kindly provided by Dr. Marc Caron, and the rat wild-type and dominant-negative β-arrestin 2 were provided by Dr. Jeff Benovic. MAP Kinase Stimulation—Activation of MAP kinase was assessed as previously described for HEK 293 cells (32Schramm N.L. Limbird L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with a few alterations. Clonal lines were plated in 35-mm plastic dishes (Falcon) at 50% confluency and grown until reaching 70–80% confluency. The cells were serum-deprived overnight the day before the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the cell medium was removed and replaced with high salt glucose buffer (HSGB) for 1.5–2 h due to the potential contributions of the calcium in the cell culture medium. HSGB contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgS04, 1 mm KH2P04, and 10 mm glucose. After the pretreatment period (either concanavalin A or pertussis toxin) cells were stimulated with either 4 mm CaCl2 or 1 μm NPS R-467 with 0.5 mm CaCl2. For comparisons of the kinetics of ERK1/2 activation between 4 mm Ca2+ versus the NPS agonist, experiments were done on the same day and with cells from the same passage number. After the indicated times, the drug medium solution was removed and rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 10 units/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and 10 units/ml aprotinin (Bayer Corp., Kankakee, IL). The lysates were transferred to an Eppendorf tube on ice, sonicated for 20 s, then placed in a heating block at 95 °C for 5 min. The lysates were then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at room temperature for 5 min to remove debris. The supernatants were assayed in a Bio-Rad protein assay for relative protein concentration, and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis and transfer onto nitrocellulose. MAP kinase (ERK1/2) activation was evaluated using an antibody that recognizes dually phosphorylated (Thr/Tyr) MAP kinase (Promega #V6671) and normalized to total MAP kinase using an antibody that recognizes MAP kinase regardless of its phosphorylation state (NEB #9102). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) images were scanned into Adobe Photoshop with a HP Scanjet 6200C scanner. Western Analyses for the CaR—Lysates of the HEK-hCaR cells were prepared as described above except without sodium orthovanadate. The lysate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min, and the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 13,500 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 30 min. The pellet from this spin was then resuspended in lysis buffer, and comparable amounts of protein were used as determined by the Bradford protein assay. About 20 μg of the cellular membrane fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Proteins in the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose, after which the membrane was blocked (4% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% gelatin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The anti-CaR antibody (rabbit anti-CaR antibody, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO; #PA1–934) was then added at a dilution of 1:1000 in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with rinse buffer (10% goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) 3 × 15 min followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature). After washing (3 × 15 min) the membrane was treated with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences), covered in plastic wrap, and exposed to film to visualize the ECL signal. Blocking Receptor Internalization with Concanavalin A—Cells were pretreated for 30 min with 250 μg/ml concanavalin A made up fresh in HSGB 10 min before use. EGF receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation (25 ng EGF/ml for 5 min) was used as a positive control to demonstrate that the concanavalin A was able to block this signaling pathway of this tyrosine kinase receptor pathway as previously demonstrated (33Tang H. Nishishita T. Fitzgerald T. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13420-13426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Wild-type or K44A Dominant-negative Dynamin or Wild-type or Dominant-negative β-Arrestin 2—The HEK-hCaR cells plated in 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected with either human wild-type or K44A dominant negative dynamin I in pCB1 or with wild-type or dominant negative β-arrestin 2 using the Polyfect® Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, #301105) according to the handbook directions. Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were stimulated with agonists, and ERK1/2 activation was determined as described above. To confirm positive expression of both forms of transfected dynamin, membranes from both wild-type and K44A-transfected cells were harvested, subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses using an antibody directed against dynamin (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY; #D25520), and compared with untransfected control cells. Co-expression of PTX-resistant Gαi Subunits—The cDNAs of individual pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαi subunits were transiently co-expressed using the Polyfect® transfection reagent as described above. The cDNA constructs that have the C351I mutation render these subunits (Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3) insensitive to PTX treatment, as described previously (34Delmas P. Abogadie F.C. Milligan G. Buckley N.J. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis and Confocal Microscopy—All steps were done at room temperature while rocking on a rotating platform. The coverslips containing the cells (50 to 70% confluent, plated in 24-well plates) were washed twice with PBS (154 mm NaCl, 11 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) fortified with extra calcium and magnesium (1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2), constituting PBS/CM, to facilitate the cells adhering to the poly-lysinecoated glass coverslips. They were then fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde made up fresh in PBS. The remaining paraformaldehyde was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl made up fresh in PBS for 15 min. The cells were then rinsed twice with PBS/CM, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 made up in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum diluted in PBS for 1 h. The blocking solution was then aspirated off, and the cells were rinsed once with PBS. The coverslips were incubated with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-CaR antibody) at a dilution of 1:150 in 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. The primary antibody was aspirated off, and the cells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 10 min per incubation. After washing, the cells were incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Cy3, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:500 in PBST for 1 h. The secondary antibody was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBST (10-min incubations each) and once with PBS. Coverslips were then mounted onto slides with Crystal Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) and allowed to dry. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 (Bio-Rad) confocal imaging system operated via a Nikon Diaphot (Nikon Inc., Garden City, NY) inverted microscope. Sample illumination was via a krypton-argon laser using 568-nm excitation and a 598 + 40-nm emission filter. Lasersharp acquisition software (Bio-Rad) allowed for z-resolution imaging at either 0.5- or 1-μm increments. ERK1/2 Is Activated by CaR Agonists—Four mm Ca2+ rapidly and robustly activate ERK1/2 in HEK-293 cells, which express the human CaR (∼120–140 kDa due to differential glycosylation states, Fig. 1A, and immunofluorescence, Fig. 1B). The lack of ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells not heterologously expressing the CaR (Fig. 1A) indicates that the ERK1/2 signaling in this cell line (19Kifor O. MacLeod R.J. Diaz R. Bai M. Yamaguchi T. Yao T. Kifor I. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: 291-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is CaR-mediated. Interestingly, the time course of ERK1/2 activation was delayed when NPS R-467 was used to activate CaR when compared with activation by 4 mm Ca2+. As seen in Fig. 1B, 1 μm NPS R-467 in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2 did not achieve maximal activity until 10 min after presenting the stimulus to the cells instead of the usual 2-min maximal responses seen with 4 mm CaCl2 alone. The NPS R-467 agonist did not activate ERK1/2 activity in cells not expressing the CaR (Fig. 1B) nor in the absence of added CaCl2 (data not shown). Lack of ERK1/2 Desensitization in HEK-hCaR Cells with the NPS R-467 Agonist Versus Ca2+ Alone—Consistently, we observed that 4 mm Ca2+ stimulated ERK1/2 was reduced at 60 min to a level slightly above base line and down to base line by 4 h (Fig. 2A). In contrast, there was no significant desensitization to CaR stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation when 1 μm NPS R-467 in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2 was used as agonists, even as late as 240 min after the addition of stimulus (Fig. 2B). A densitometric analysis of the data obtained from 4–6 separate experiments comparing the 10- and 60-min time points for ERK1/2 activation in Fig. 1B reveals that there is significant desensitization with the endogenous ligand, calcium, for the CaR, whereas there is no desensitization at 60 min with NPS R-467. The desensitization observed with 4 mm calcium undergoes rather rapid resensitization (Fig. 2C). Thus, a 10-min stimulation with 4 mm CaCl2 alone followed by a 30-min wash period demonstrated a full recovery of calcium to activate ERK1/2, with the same kinetics as before prior agonist exposure. These findings suggest that this GPCR rapidly recovers from desensitization, perhaps by a mechanism involving rapid recycling. Blocking Receptor Internalization Inhibits CaR Agonist-mediated ERK1/2 Activation—Numerous studies have shown that some GPCRs require internalization to activate ERK1/2. To determine whether CaR endocytosis is required for ERK1/2 activation, we exploited several independent experimental strategies used to inhibit recruitment to clathrin-coated pits (pretreatment of concanavalin A, which prevents internalization of membrane-associated receptors by stabilizing the surface integrity due to tetravalent lectin contacts (35Toews M.L. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11844-11850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and dynamin- and/or arrestin-dependent internalization (co-expression with either dominant negative (K44A) dynamin 1 or dominant negative β-arrestin). Treatment with concanavalin A revealed additional differences in CaR activation by 4 mm Ca2+ versus activation by NPS R-467/CaCl2. As seen in Fig. 3A, a 30-min pretreatment of the HEK-hCaR with 250 μg/ml concanavalin A completely eliminated the NPS R-467/0.5 mm CaCl2-induced ERK1/2 activation. Hypertonic sucrose pretreatment, which also perturbs the clathrin-coated pit internalization pathway, also blocked the ability of CaR to activate ERK1/2 when stimulate with NPS R-467/CaCl2 (data not shown). When the HEK-hCaR cells were stimulated with 4 mm CaCl2, pretreatment with concanavalin A only eliminated the later time points of ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3B), whereas the 2-min time point of ERK1/2 activation remained intact. This observation may represent a bifurcation in the CaR-mediated ERK1/2 signaling pathway in HEK-hCaR cells, since 2 min is sufficient to robustly activate ERK1/2 with calcium alone yet may not be ample time for agonist-elicited receptor loss from the cell surface. It may also be indicative of a type of receptor “cross-talk” with calcium channels. The functional efficacy of the concanavalin A treatment to block CaR endocytosis is seen in the confocal images in Fig. 3B, where the intracellular pool of CaR present at steady-state is no longer as prevalent, as well as in its ability to block EGF receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation on the same blot (Fig. 3A), as the ability of concanavalin A to block the tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated activation of ERK1/2 has been demonstrated in some systems (33Tang H.

Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that CaR internalization is partially required for ERK1/2 activation and further suggest the possibility that like other GPCRs, CaR activation of ERK1/2 by NPS R-467/CaCl2 and the later wave of 4 mm Ca2+ activation may involve receptor cross-talk with the receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. Dynamin is a 100-kDa GTPase that binds to clathrin-coated pits, where it oligomerizes around the neck of the budding clathrin vesicles. A point mutant form of dynamin, K44A, is a dominant negative form of the wild-type in that it interferes with the regular dynamics of dynamin and thereby inhibits vesicular endocytosis (37Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Co-expression of dominant negative dynamin (K44A) was also explored as a tool to evaluate the dependence of internalization for agonist-elicited ERK1/2 activation. As seen in Fig. 4A, overexpression of dynamin K44A (as confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody against dynamin, bottom blot) did not eliminate 4 mm CaCl2-mediated ERK1/2 activation in HEK-hCaR. The ability of dynamin K44A to interfere with the normal internalization processes was confirmed by its ability to block EGF receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation, as has been previously described by others (38Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 39Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and argues against a need for EGF receptor signaling cross-talk to achieve CaR activation of ERK1/2 (the lack of total elimination of EGF receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation can be attributed to the 70% transfection efficiency of this procedure (40Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar)). When HEK-hCaR cells co-expressed with dynamin K44A were stimulated with the NPS R-467 agonist with 0.5 mm CaCl2, ERK1/2 activation was also not blocked (Fig. 4B). Overexpression of dominant negative β-arrestin 2, a protein known for its roles in both receptor desensitization and internalization that serves as a scaffolding protein the ERK and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 cascade, also did not interfere with the ability of CaR agonist to activate ERK1/2. Stimulation of CaR with NPS R-467/CaCl2 (Fig. 4C) or with 4 mm Ca2+ (not shown) was indistinguishable in HEK-hCaR cells transfected with either wild-type β-arrestin 2 or dominant negative β-arrestin 2. However, dominant negative β-arrestin 2 did block EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Last, as seen in Fig. 4D, expression of K44A or dominant negative dynamin did not affect stimulation with NPS R-467 as late as 4 h, including time points at which the allosteric modulator has its most distinguishing effects. The Pertussis Toxin-sensitive Activation of ERK1/2 by CaR Is Restored by Gαi2 but Not by Gαi1 or Gαi3—Numerous GPCRs mediate MAP kinase activation by coupling to the Gi family of G proteins and are, therefore, sensitive to pertussis toxin pretreatment. Pertussis toxin (PTX) catalyzes the selective ADP-ribosylation of Gi/o proteins and eliminates their functional interactions with cognate GPCR. Kifor et al. (19Kifor O. MacLeod R.J. Diaz R. Bai M. Y"

The molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis by PML-RARα has been the focus of intensive research in the past decade. PML belongs to a family of Ring finger proteins characterized by the presence of the RBCC motif (3Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In PML, this motif consists of a C3HC4-type zinc finger domain known as the Ring finger, two cysteine-rich regions termed B-boxes, and a leucine-rich heptad repeat known as the coiled-coil domain. Although exact roles these domains play in PML function are still poorly understood, it is believed that they serve as protein-protein interacting interfaces. PML negatively regulates cellular proliferation (4Mu Z.M. Chin K.V. Liu J.H. Lozano G. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6858-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 5Wang Z.G. Delva L.

This event is believed to be linked to transformation because reorganization of NBs always occurs when leukemic cells are induced to differentiate by retinoid (RA) treatment. PML is involved in multiple activities, including Mad- and Rb-mediated transcriptional repression (8Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S.

For instance, PML binds via its coiled-coil region to multiple corepressors (8Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. Mol.

Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). The binding of PML to the corepressors causes the corepressors to be recruited to the NBs (8Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C.

In Pml-deficient cells, the transcriptional repression mediated by Mad or Rb is impaired, suggesting that the PML-mediated localization of the corepressors to NBs is an important event needed for the proper function of the corepressors (8Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. Mol.

Mapping studies show that this activity depends on the presence of the two N-CoR-interacting sites of PML-RARα, namely, the coiled-coil domain in the PML part and the CoR-box located on the RAR moiety (8Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. Mol.

Such binding may induce the N-CoR protein to adopt an abnormal conformation. PML is also involved in p53 acetylation (15Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) and the recruitment of DNA methyltransferase (16Di Croce L. Raker V.A. Corsaro M. Fazi F. Fanelli M. Faretta M. Fuks F. Lo Coco F. Kouzarides T. Nervi C. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Science. 2002; 295: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In addition, the oncogenicity of PML-RARα has been found to involve the silencing the genes of the RA signaling pathway by actively recruiting the histone deacetylase complex (17Lin R.J Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller Jr., W.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 18Grignani F. De Matteis S. Nervi C. Tomassoni L. Gelmetti V. Cioce M. Fanelli M.

Thus, the role of nuclear PML-RARα in leukemogenesis has been extensively studied. Significant levels of PML-RARα are also found in the cytoplasm (6Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller Jr., W.H. Chen J.D. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). However, the roles such cytoplasmic PML-RARα molecules may play in leukemogenesis are much less well understood than those played by the nuclear-localized molecules. In this study, we found that the cytoplasmic PML-RARα molecules may recruit the newly synthesized N-CoR molecules to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by directing them into the protein quality control system of the cell. This system is a post-translational process whereby newly synthesized polypeptides that fail to attain the proper structure are either refolded or degraded (19Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The mutated proteins or the accidentally generated proteins by various mechanisms such as chromosome rearrangement are somehow recognized as misfolded and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (20Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). A key site for protein quality control is the ER as it is one of the major sites of protein synthesis and the portal of entry for proteins into the secretory pathway. When misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, they are degraded via the proteasome in a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (21Fewell S.W. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Brodsky J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 149-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER also induces the proteolytic processing of the bZIP transcription factor ATF6 into its active form, which then leads to the transcriptional induction of ER chaperones and folding enzymes (22Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). The latter process is termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here we report that PML-RARα induces the accumulation of insoluble N-CoR protein primarily in the ER, which leads to decreased levels of soluble N-CoR protein in the nucleus. Since N-CoR protein in the nucleus is vital for the transcriptional repression mediated by the tumor suppressor Mad (14Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J.

Plasmids and Vectors—The chicken β-actin promoter containing plasmids to express N-CoR, PML-RARα, and PML, and the GST-PML expression vectors encoding various forms of PML were described previously (8Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The PCR-based method was employed to construct various PML-RARα mutant expression plasmids. In the PML-RARα RF (Ring finger point mutant) construct, the cysteine residues at 57 and 60 of the Ring finger domain of PML were substituted with serine. In PML-RARΔC-C, the whole coiled-coil domain (residues 228-365) was deleted. Similarly, in the B-boxes deletion mutant, the deleted region was the two B-boxes and intervening region, extending from residue 130 to 227. In the PML-RARα (AHT) mutant construct, the A, H, and T residues at 223, 224, and 227 sites, which are required for interaction with the N-CoR molecule, were replaced by G, G, and A residues, respectively. The HA-ATF6 expression vector (pCGN-ATF6) was described previously (22Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). To express Ubc5 or Ubc6 in 293T cells, the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) was used. In Ubc5(CS) and Ubc6(CS) expression vectors, the active cysteine residue was replaced with serine. Immunocytochemistry—293T cells were co-transfected with pact-N-CoR-FLAG (1 μg) together with pact-HA-PML-RARα or pact-HA-PML (1 μg), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or methanol, and stained with either anti-PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-PDI (Stress Gene), anti-BiP (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibodies. For visualization of Golgi signals, cells were transfected with Ds-Red-Golgi (0.5 μg) expression plasmid. Staining of NB4 cells was performed under similar conditions using anti-PML (8Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. Mol.

DNA was stained with TO-PRO (Molecular Probes). Subcellular Fractionation—293T cells co-transfected with N-CoR and PML-RARα plasmids or NB4 cells, were harvested in 2 ml of ice-cold homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture), homogenized by passing 50 times in a Potter-Teflon homogenizer on ice. Post-nuclear supernatant was obtained (3,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and Nycodenz gradient fractionation was performed essentially as described (24Tran K. Thorne-Tjomsland G. DeLong J.C. Cui Z. Shan J.

A step gradient was created in Beckman SW41 centrifuge tubes by loading top to bottom 2.5 ml of 10, 14.66, 19.33, and 24% of Nycodenz solution in saline buffer. The solutions were prepared from 27.6% Nycodenz stock solution and 0.75% NaCl (both in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3). The tube was placed vertically for 45 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation (37,000 rpm, 4 h, 15 °C, SW41 rotor). 2 ml of the post-nuclear supernatant was layered on top of the gradient and fractionated by centrifugation (37,000 rpm, 1.5 h, 15 °C). After centrifugation, fractions (0.8 ml each) were collected from top of the tube using. Aliquots (40 μl) of each fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies specific for marker proteins of various subcellular compartments. Protease Sensitivity of N-CoR—NB4 cells were seeded at 20 × 104 cells/ml and treated with RA (1 μm) for 3 days. Cells were harvested and disrupted with hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenizer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was kept, and nuclei were extracted with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl). Nuclei extract and the cytoplasm supernatant were mixed and used as whole cell lysates. Cell lysates were treated with indicated amount of proteinase K or trypsin for 30 min on ice. The degradation products were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-N-CoR antibodies. ATF6 Processing—NB4 cells were treated with RA (1 μm) or vehicle for 72 h, and lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with the anti-ATF6 antibody (rabbit anti-B03N) (22Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). To detect the processing of exogenous protein, HeLa cells were co-transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with the HA-ATF6 expression vector and the plasmids expressing N-CoR and PML-RARα or PML. Cells were treated with tunicamycin (2.5 μg/ml) or dithiothreitol (5 mm) for the indicted time before the preparation of lysates. Twenty-four hours after transfection, lysates were prepared as described above and various forms of HA-ATF6 were detected by using the anti-HA antibody. Protein Solubility, Fractionation, and Western Blotting—293T cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE with the N-CoR expression plasmid pact-N-CoR-FLAG (3 μg) and the plasmid expressing various forms of PML-RARα or the control blank DNA (3 μg), and the internal control pact-β-gal (0.5 μg). Forty hours after transfection, cells were passively lysed in NET buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture) containing 300 mm NaCl and centrifuged. The soluble fraction was harvested, and the insoluble fraction was solubilized by sonication in SDS sample buffer, after which fragmented DNA was removed by Sepharose beads. The soluble and insoluble fractions were used for Western blotting with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of lysate used for Western blotting was normalized on the basis of the β-galatosidase activity. NB4 cells were treated with vehicle, MG132 (5 μm) for 8 h or with RA (1 μm) for 72 h. The soluble fraction of NB4 cells was prepared as described above. To determine the total endogenous N-CoR levels in NB4 cells, lysates were prepared in highly stringent RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDC, 0.5% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture) by passing though a syringe 10 times with a 21-gauge needle followed by 3 times with a 26-gauge needle. For each lane in Western blotting, 100 μg of protein was used to detect the N-CoR protein with the anti-N-CoR antibody. As a loading control, aliquots of sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Pulse-chase Experiments—293T cells were transfected with the N-CoR-FLAG (3 μg) expression vector together with the PML-RARα expression plasmid or the control DNA (3 μg), and pact-β-gal (0.5 μg). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 6 h, and then the radioactivity was chased. At various times, lysates were prepared using the NET buffer containing 300 mm NaCl (to prepare soluble N-CoR) or the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2% SDS) (to prepare both the soluble and insoluble N-CoR), heated for 10 min at 95 °C and immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody after 10-fold dilution and brief sonication. The immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of pact-N-CoR-FLAG expression vector, 2 μg of pcDNA3-Myc-Ub expression vector, and 2 μg of pact-HA-PML-RARα or empty actin vector. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 12 h or with RA (2 μm) for 30 h. The cells were then scraped into 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2% SDS), heated for 10 min at 95 °C, diluted with buffer lacking SDS to reduce the SDS concentration to 0.2%, and then sonicated mildly on ice. After pre-adsorption with protein G- Sepharose, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was used to precipitate the immunocomplexes, which were then used for Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody (MBL). For the ubiquitination assay of N-CoR in NB4 Cells, NB4 cells (4 × 107) were treated with MG132 (5 μm, 12 h) or RA (1 μm, 3 days), and lysates were prepared as described above, immunoprecipitated with anti-N-CoR antibody, and blotted with antiubiquitin antibody (FL-76, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To examine the effect of the dominant negative form of Ubc6, 293T cells was transfected with 1.5 μg of pact-N-CoR-FLAG, 1.5 μg pact-HA-PML-RARα and 1 μg of pcDNA3-Myc-Ubiquitin with an increasing amount of pcDNA3-Ubc6 (CS mutant) or Ubc5 (CS mutant) expression vectors, and ubiquitination assays were performed as described above. GST Pull-down Assays and Co-immunoprecipitation—GST pull-down assays were performed essentially as described (8Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The GST fusion of full-length PML-RARα or various domains of PML were used with various in vitro-translated Ubc enzymes in a binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin. For co-immunoprecipitation of PML-RARα and Ubc6, lysates from 293T cells transfected with 3 μg of pact-HA- PML-RARα and 3 μg of FLAG-Ubc6 expression vector were prepared by sonication in LSLD buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 20 μm NaF, 20% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG antibody, and the anti-HA antibody was used for Western blotting. For co-immunoprecipitation between endogenous Ubc6 and PML-RARα, lysate of NB4 cells prepared in above mentioned buffer was immunoprecipitated with UbcH6 antibody (Boston Bio-chemicals) and Western was done with anti-RARα antibody to detect endogenous PML-RARα protein. For co-immunoprecipitation of PML-RARα and PDI, NB4 cells were lysed in PBS-0.1% Nonidet P-40 by mild sonication, immunoprecipitated with the anti-PDI antibody and blotted with the anti-RAR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To detect the association of N-CoR with PDI, a cytosolic fraction of NB4 cells was prepared as described below, immunoprecipitated with anti-PDI antibody, washed with PBS, and N-CoR was detected with goat anti-N-CoR antibody. Flow Cytometry—The retroviral expression plasmid for N-CoR was constructed using the MSCV (murine stem cell virus)-based retroviral vector. The plasmid pMSCV-N-CoR encodes both N-CoR and GFP separated by internal ribosome entry site so that they are expressed together. NB4 cells (10 × 106 cells) were transfected with 40 μg of pMSCV-N-CoR or MSCV empty vector using DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) for 24 h, and then complete medium was added and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. After that, the cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, 0.5% BSA, and incubated in 500 μl of PBS, 0.5% BSA with RPE-conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-human CD14 antibodies (DAKO) for 60 min on ice. The cells were then washed with PBS-0.5% BSA and analyzed on a FACScan flow cyometer (BD Biosciences). The GFP-positive cells comprised 3-4% of all the NB4 cells. To detect the exogenous N-CoR in NB4 cells, lysate prepared from nuclear fraction of transfected NB4 cells was subjected to Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. To investigate the effect of tunicamycin on RA-mediated differentiation of NB4 cells, NB4 cells were treated with RA (1 μm) alone or with RA and tunicamycin (2.5 μg/ml). Tunicamycin was added in RA-treated cells 24 h before harvesting. Cells were incubated with RPE-conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-human CD11b antibody (DAKO), and FACS analysis was done as described above. Luciferase Reporter Assays—293T cells in 6-well plates were co-transfected with the Gal4 site-containing luciferase reporter vector (0.1 μg), the Ubc6(CS) or Ubc5(CS) expression plasmids in increasing amount (0.2-μg increments), PML-RARα (0.2 μg) expression plasmid, and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (0.01 μg) using LipofectAMINE-Plus reagent. Dual luciferase assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The PML-RARα/N-CoR Complex Is Recruited to the ER—We previously demonstrated that PML-RARα has two sites that directly bind to N-CoR (8Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T.

Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43491-43494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is possible that when the N-CoR molecule binds to PML-RARα through these two sites, it adopts an aberrant protein conformation. This may cause N-CoR to become a target of the protein quality control machinery located in the ER. To test this, we assessed whether the PML-RARα/N-CoR complex is bound by protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and BiP/GRP78 (immunoglobulin-binding protein/glucose-regulated protein), two of the ER-resident proteins, as they have been shown to mediate ER retention and degradation of poorly assembled and misfolded proteins (25Bottomley M.J. Batten M.R. Lumb R.A. Bulleid N.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1114-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 293T cells were cotransfected with the PML-RARα and N-CoR expression vectors and stained with antibodies against either protein together with antibodies that recognize the endogenous PDI and BiP molecule, followed by confocal microscopy analysis. When N-CoR or PML-RARα was expressed alone, the N-CoR signals were localized in the nuclear dot-like structures known as NBs, while PML-RARα was found predominantly in the cytosol like the endogenous PDI and BiP (Fig. 1A). As reported (6Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller Jr., W.H. Chen J.D. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), the microspeckled nuclear PML and PML-RARα signals were very weak compared with the cytosolic signals of overexpressed PML-RARα signals. When N-CoR was co-expressed with PML-RARα, both proteins colocalized with the endogenous PDI or BiP molecules in the ER (Fig. 1B). The signal of PDI and BiP proteins in 293T cells co-expressing PML-RARα/N-CoR was much stronger than those of non-transfected cells, suggesting that co-expression of PML-RARα/N-CoR may induce expression of those proteins (Fig. 1, A and B). When PML-RARα/N-CoR were co-expressed with Golgi-ds-Red, a vector containing Golgi-targeting sequence, some fraction of the PML-RARα/N-CoR signals colocalized with the Golgi signal (Fig. 1C). RA treatment of transfected cells co-expressing PML-RARα/N-CoR resulted in some degree of nuclear relocation of both PML-RARα and N-CoR, and PML NBs formation (Fig. 1D). To confirm the localization of the PML-RARα/N-CoR complex in the ER, we performed a Nycodenz gradient fractionation of the cytoplasmic lysates prepared from 293T cells ectopically expressing N-CoR and PML-RARα (Fig. 1E). Subcellular compartments were fractionated by Nycodenz gradient, and each fraction was probed with antibodies specific to marker protein of the compartment. Fractions 10-16 were designated ER by their possession of either PDI or BiP, and fractions 4-8 were designated Golgi because they contained Golgin-97, the integral membrane protein localized on the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi apparatus (26Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). N-CoR was found predominantly in the ER fraction and to some extent, also in the Golgi fraction. PML-RARα was known to form a dimer or oligomer (27Minucci S Maccarana M. Cioce M. De Luca P. Gelmetti V. Segalla S. Di Croce L. Giavara S. Matteucci C. Gobbi A. Bianchini A. Colombo E. Schiavoni I.

Cell. 2000; 5: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and we could detect both monomer and dimer under standard SDS-PAGE conditions, probably due to its very strong capacity to form a dimer. Both the dimeric and monomeric forms of PML-RARα were found in the ER fraction, while the monomeric PML-RARα was also abundant in the Golgi fraction.

https://openalex.org/W2122557223,"Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is a membrane channel that allows rapid water movement driven by a transmembrane osmotic gradient. It was claimed to have a secondary function as a cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel. However, upon reconstitution into planar bilayers, the ion channel exhibited a 10-fold lower single channel conductance than in Xenopus oocytes and a 100-fold lower open probability (<10-6) of doubtful physiological significance (Saparov, S. M., Kozono, D., Rothe, U., Agre, P., and Pohl, P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 31515–31520). Investigating AQP1 expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, we now have shown that the discrepancy is not due to alterations of AQP1 properties upon reconstitution into bilayers but rather to regulatory processes of the oocyte expression system that may have been misinterpreted as AQP1 ion channel activity. As confirmed by laser scanning reflection microscopy, from 0.8 to 1.4 × 106 AQP1 copies/cell contributed to osmotic cell swelling. The proper plasma membrane localization was confirmed by observing the fluorescence of the N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein tag. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments of wild type or tagged AQP1-expressing cells revealed that neither cGMP nor cAMP mediated ion channel activity. The lack of significant CNG ion channel activity rules out a secondary role of AQP1 water channels in cellular signal transduction.

Aquaporins (AQP), 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; LSRM, laser scanning reflection microscopy; CNG, cyclic nucleotide-gated; CNB domain, cyclic nucleotide binding domain. found in all life forms including bacteria, plants, and mammals, facilitate rapid transmembrane water movement, which is driven by a transmembrane osmotic gradient (1Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). In humans 11 members of the family (AQP0–10) have been found so far (2Hatakeyama S. Yoshida Y. Tani T. Koyama Y. Nihei K. Ohshiro K. Kamiie J.I. Yaoita E. Suda T. Hatakeyama K. Yamamoto T. Biochem.

AQP1, abundant in hematopoietic tissue, kidneys, and choroid plexus epithelium, and transiently observed in periosteum, heart, vascular endothelium, and cornea during fetal development (3Bondy D.

Science. 1996; 273: 1216-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or a cGMP-gated cation channel (13Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol.

Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The channel characteristics, however, were totally different. Single ion channel conductivities of 145 or 10 pS and open probabilities of 1:56,000 or 1:106 were, respectively, obtained in the Xenopus oocyte expression system or with reconstituted planar bilayers. Whereas the former result suggest an impact on kidney proximal tubule function (15Yool A.J. Weinstein A.M. News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 68-72PubMed Google Scholar) and a role in transmembrane signaling (16Boassa D. Yool A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 558-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the latter allows us to conclude that AQP1-mediated ion conductance is of doubtful physiological importance. The tiny fraction of ion-conducting channels corresponds to less than one channel/cell even in AQP1-rich tissue such as red cells (17Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To clarify whether the discrepancy is due to (i) a cofactor required for ion channel activation but missing in the reconstituted system or (ii) a regulatory response of the oocyte that may up-regulate channels along with AQP1 expression, we have used mammalian cells (HEK293) to express AQP1 fused to or cotransfected with the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Protein expression and proper plasma membrane localization were controlled by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Water permeability was measured by observing the volume increase of the cells with laser scanning reflection microscopy (LSRM). cGMP-gated cation conductivity of AQP1 was tested with the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Plasmid Construction, Cell Culture, and Transfection—Human AQP1 DNA (a kind gift from Dr. Peter Agre) was subcloned into pEYFP-C1 vector (BD Clontech) to create the YFP-tagged AQP1 plasmid at the N terminus of human AQP1 (pST001). Residues 2 and 3 of AQP1 were replaced with SATQISSSSF. A second (wild type AQP1) expression vector was constructed by removing YFP (except the first Met) and the following linker segment from the pST001 plasmid (pST002). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. 1 × 106 cells were plated on a polylysine-coated glass plate (30 mm diameter) in a 35-mm dish 1 day before transient transfections. LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was employed to perform transfections with 1–2 μg of plasmid DNA. Two different sets of experiments were performed: (i) transfection with YFP-AQP1 (pST001) or (ii) cotransfection of AQP1 (pST002) with the pEYFP-C1 vector. In both cases, protein expression was controlled by exiting YFP at 488 nm and observing its fluorescence with a long-pass emission filter of 570 nm. One or 2 days after transfection, individualized cells were selected for swelling and patch clamp experiments. Osmotic Permeability Measurement—Osmotic water permeability (Pf) was determined from the time course of cell swelling at 22 °C in response to a 2-fold dilution of the extracellular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (300 mosm) with distilled water. Plasma membrane osmotic Pf was calculated for single adherent cells by Equation 1 (18Maric K. Wiesner B. Lorenz D. Klussmann E. Betz T. Rosenthal W. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1783-1790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Pf=(τ(A/V)0Vωϕ0)-1(Eq. 1) where τ, (A/V)0, and VW are, respectively, the time constant of the exponential function, which describes cell volume change due to challenge by the transmembrane osmotic gradient, the initial ratio of the cell surface area (A) to volume (V), and the molar volume of water (18 cm3/mol). τ was obtained from a time series of cell images captured by LSRM (LSM410 or LSM510, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using a long-pass emission filter of 575 nm (x 63 water immersion objective). The x-z image of the cell was scanned every 2 s and processed by the KS-400 image analyzing software (Zeiss). The time dependent increase of cell areas a was fitted with the exponential Equation 2, a(t)=amin+(amax-amin)(1-e(-t/τ))(Eq. 2) The x-y images were scanned in an 0.5-μm discrete for z direction to determine A and V. The integrated cell surrounding and cell area of all the images were regarded as A and V, respectively. Ion Conductivity Measurements—Conventional whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed to measure membrane currents of HEK293 cells. The pipettes were fabricated from 0.18-mm-thick wall borosilicate glass tubing with an outer diameter of 1.8 mm (Hilgenberg, Germany). After two pulling steps, the tip of the pipettes was coated with silicone (Sylgard) and then fire-polished. The bath solution contained 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose adjusted to pH 7.1 with NaOH. The pipette solution consisted of 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, and 125 mm K-l-glutamate adjusted to pH 7.1 with KOH. Whole-cell current was recorded using a patch clamp amplifier (EPC9, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) operated by PulseFit software (HEKA). The data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2.9 kHz. Expression of AQP1 and YFP-AQP1 in HEK293 Cells—Because the cGMP binding domain is believed to be located at the C terminus (13Anthony T.L.

Aquaporins tagged with a fluorescent protein at the N terminus are known to retain their functional activity (19Hoque A.T. Liu X. Kagami H. Swaim W.D. Wellner R.B. O'Connell B.C. Ambudkar I.S.

The untagged YFP was homogeneously distributed throughout the cell plasma (not shown). Its fluorescence was monitored to identify the HEK cells, which expressed the untagged (wild type) AQP1. Number of Water Channels Expressed in the Plasma Membrane—Fig. 2A shows typical LSRM x-z scanning reflection images of HEK293 cells. Upon osmotic challenge, the cell height immediately began to increase. From a series of reflection images, the time course of cell swelling was calculated (Fig. 2B). The Pf of nontransfected cells (51.9 μm/s) was trebled by wild type AQP1 expression (174.8 μm/s) and doubled by YFP-AQP1 expression (117.5 μm/s). It was reduced to the Pf of control cells by 200 μm HgCl2, a known AQP1 inhibitor. HgCl2 itself did not alter the swelling rate of control cells significantly (see Table I for a Pf summary). From the incremental Pf introduced by AQP1 (174.8-51.9 = 122.9 μm/s), the number of water channels (n)/cell was calculated using Equation 3, n=PfA/pf=122.9×10-4(cm/s)×A(cm2)/6×10-14(cm3/s)=1.43×106(Eq. 3) where A is the calculated cell surface area, and pf is the known single channel water permeability (21Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S.V. Smith B.L. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar).

The current was measured for 200 ms at voltages from -80 to +40 mV in 20-mV steps. Current traces and current-voltage (I-V) relationships of transfected cells are indistinguishable from control cells (Fig. 3). The slope at 0 mV corresponded to a conductivity of 0.25 nS (n = 24). 100 μm cGMP (n = 7) or cAMP (n = 8) in the internal pipette solution failed to activate ion channels. The membrane-permeable 8-bromo-cGMP (5 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) in the bath solution also did not induce an incremental increase in current (n = 5) (Fig. 3). Our studies demonstrate that AQP1 is a water-selective channel lacking CNG channel activity. Expressed in HEK293 cells at a density of about 510 or 275 tetramers/μm2, neither AQP1 nor YFP-AQP1 responded to stimulation by cGMP, cAMP, or 8-bromo-cGMP. Because the expression levels compare well with that in AQP-rich tissues (∼325 tetramers/μm2 in red blood cells) (17Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J.

Sci. 2002; 23: 558-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) seems to be highly unlikely. The results correspond well to the observation that the number of ion channels is more than 1,000,000-fold lower than the number of water channels (5Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In transfected HEK293 cells, which contain 3.6 × 105 AQP1 tetramers or 1.9 × 105 YFP-AQP1 tetramers/cell, this translates to less than one channel/cell. Given their tiny conductance of 10 pS (5Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the opening of a channel would have remained unnoticed because of the background conductivity of the cells. In contrast, the existence of channels with parameters predicted from oocyte experiments (13Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) can be ruled out easily. Opening of one 145-pS wide ion channel/14,000 tetramers would have translated to 2.1 or 4.1 nS/per HEK293 cell transfected with YFP-AQP1 or AQP1, respectively. In both cases the incremental conductivity would have exceeded the background conductivity of transfected cells by about 1 order of magnitude. Re-examination of the putative cGMP binding domain at the C terminus (13Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) revealed similarities with the sequence of Ca2+-binding proteins belonging to the calmodulin superfamily (22Fotiadis D. Suda K. Tittmann P. Jeno P. Philippsen A. Muller D.J. Gross H. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1381-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain of CNG channels (Fig. 4A) includes ∼120 amino acid residues forming three α helices and 8-stranded β-rolls structure (23Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The putative cGMP binding domain of AQP1 lacks a large part of the CNB domain (Fig. 4B), among them such highly conserved and invariant residues as Glu-544 and Arg-559, which interact directly with cyclic nucleotides (23Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Thus, the AQP1 C terminus seems to be unable to mimic the full-length CNB. The result is a drastic reduction in binding affinity that, in turn, leads to the activation of only an astonishingly tiny fraction of ion channels (5Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Their number is too small to be detected in transfected HEK293 cells or to participate in signal transduction. The regulation of water channel function by cyclic nucleotides is restricted to an adjustment of AQP2 abundance in the plasma membrane by exocytosis (24Lorenz D. Krylov A. Hahm D. Hagen V. Rosenthal W. Pohl P. Maric K. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There is no indication for a secondary role of AQP as CNG channels in mammalian cells. We conclude that the cGMP-triggered AQP1 ion channel characteristics reported in an oocyte expression system (13Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) were biased by a regulatory response of the oocyte. The function of AQP1 is limited to that of a water channel. We thank Dr. Peter Agre (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) for providing human AQP1 DNA and Dr. Enno Klussmann for helpful discussions of subcloning."

Two alternative pathways for the synthesis of MG have been identified in this bacterium: a single-step pathway and a two-step pathway. In this work, the genetic and biochemical characterization of the two-step pathway was carried out with the goal of understanding the function of the two pathways and their regulatory mechanisms. Mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase (MPGS) of the two-step pathway was purified from R. marinus. Sequence information led to the isolation of two contiguous genes, mpgs (encoding MPGS) and mpgp (encoding mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase). The recombinant MPGS had a low specific activity compared with other homologous MPGSs and contained ∼30 additional residues at the C terminus. Truncation of this extension produced a protein with a 10-fold higher specific activity. Moreover, the activity of the complete MPGS was enhanced upon incubation with R. marinus cell extracts, and protease inhibitors abolished activation. Therefore, the C-terminal peptide of MPGS was identified as a regulatory site for short term control of MG synthesis in R. marinus. The control of gene expression by heat and osmotic stress was also studied; the level of mannosylglycerate synthase involved in the single-step pathway was selectively enhanced by heat stress, whereas MPGS was overproduced in response to osmotic stress. The concomitant changes in the level of MG were assessed as well. We conclude that the two alternative pathways for the synthesis of MG are differently regulated at the level of expression to play specific roles in the adaptation of R. marinus to two different types of aggression. This is the only example of pathway multiplicity being rationalized in terms of the need to respond efficiently to distinct environmental stresses.

Thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms, like all organisms living in aqueous environments, are faced with alterations in the water activity to which they must adjust to grow. However, the compatible solutes of these organisms are generally different from those of mesophiles (1Santos H. da Costa M.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mannosylglycerate (MG) 1The abbreviations used are: MG, α-mannosylglycerate; Bis/Tris/propane, 2-[bis(hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; MPG, α-mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate; MPGS, mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase; MPGP, mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase; MGS, mannosylglycerate synthase. and the derivative compound mannosylglyceramide are the two major osmolytes used by the thermophilic bacterium Rhodothermus marinus to cope with osmotic stress at or below the optimum growth temperature (65 °C). Near the maximum growth temperature (77 °C), however, MG is the only compatible solute detected (2Silva Z. Borges N. Martins L.O. Wait R. da Costa M.S. Santos H. Extremophiles. 1999; 3: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, MG appears to be particularly suited to protect cells under conditions of heat aggression. In line with this view, MG is widely distributed among hyperthermophilic archaea and thermophilic bacteria, e.g. the slightly halophilic euryarchaeotes of the genera Pyrococcus and Thermococcus, three species of the genus Archaeoglobus, the crenarchaeote Aeropyrum pernix, and the bacteria Thermus thermophilus and Rubrobacter xylanophilus (3Lamosa P.

The synthesis of sugar-derivative compatible solutes, such as sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol, and galactosylglycerol, most often proceeds via a two-step pathway involving a phosphorylated intermediate (8Curatti L. Folco E. Desplats P. Abratti G. Limones V. Herrera-Estrella L. Salerno G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6776-6779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Giæver H.M. Styrvold O.B. Kaasen I. Strøm A.R. J.

Schoor A. Erdmann N. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In each case, the respective sugar nucleotide is combined with the appropriate polyol/sugar phosphate, yielding a phosphorylated intermediate that is subsequently hydrolyzed to form the functional osmolyte. The genes encoding the enzymes involved in the synthase/phosphatase pathways are often found in operon-like structures: trehalose synthesis in Escherichia coli or MG synthesis in Pyrococcus spp. and T. thermophilus are examples of this organization (12Kaasen I. McDougall J. Strøm A.R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Empadinhas N. Marugg J.D. Borges N. Santos H. da Costa M.S. J. Biol.

However, in Synechocystis spp. the genes encoding the synthase and the phosphatase for glucosylglycerol synthesis are under the control of distinct promoters (15Hagemann M. Schoor A. Jeanjean R. Zuther E. Joset F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Marin K. Zuther E. Kerstan T. Kunert A. Hagemann M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4843-4849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R. marinus is the only organism known to have two distinct pathways for the synthesis of MG: the two-step pathway, involving a phosphorylated intermediate, which is also found in Pyrococcus spp., A. pernix, and T. thermophilus, and the single-step pathway that, until recently, appeared to be confined to R. marinus (13Empadinhas N.

Two sequences recently identified in Griffithsia japonica (GenBank™ accession numbers AY123119 and AF542028) show high homology with the gene encoding mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) in R. marinus, suggesting the presence of the single-step pathway in this red alga, as well. The presence of two alternative pathways for the synthesis of MG in R. marinus is therefore intriguing. The biochemical and genetic characterization of the single-step pathway was reported earlier by our team (17Martins L.O. Empadinhas N. Marugg J.D. Miguel C. Ferreira C. da Costa M.S. Santos H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35407-35414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present work, the genetic and biochemical characterization of the two-step pathway was carried out with the goal of understanding the function of the two pathways and their regulatory mechanisms. The mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase (MPGS) activity that converts GDP-mannose and d-3-phosphoglycerate to mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate (MPG) was purified from R. marinus cells, and the amino acid sequence of several fragments was used to identify the genes encoding mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase and mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase (MPGP). These genes were separately cloned and overexpressed in E. coli, the respective recombinant enzymes were characterized in detail, and the regulation of the two pathways was investigated. R. marinus Strain and Growth Conditions—R. marinus strain DSM 4252T (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) was grown as previously described (18Nunes O.C. Donato M.M. da Costa M.S. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 92-97Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the evaluation of protein levels by immunoblotting, batch cultures were grown at the optimum NaCl concentration (2% NaCl) at the temperatures 57.5, 65, and 75 °C. Cultures were also grown at the optimum growth temperature (65 °C) in media with different NaCl concentrations (1, 2, 4, and 6%). Preparation of R. marinus Cell Extracts—Cells were harvested during the late-exponential phase of growth. The cell pellet was suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 5 mm MgCl2, DNase I (10 μg/ml), and a mixture of protease inhibitors: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (80 μg/ml), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), and antipain (20 μg/ml). The cells were disrupted in a French press. The amount of protein was estimated by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—During the purification, MPGS activity at 75 °C was detected with a TLC assay. MPGS activity was determined from the 1H NMR quantification of the product, MPG (13Empadinhas N. Marugg J.D. Borges N. Santos H. da Costa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43580-43588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The MPGP activity was assayed by determining the inorganic phosphate released by MPG (13Empadinhas N. Marugg J.D. Borges N. Santos H. da Costa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43580-43588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purification of Native MPGS—The native MPGS was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Ion Exchange Chromatography—The cell extracts were applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6), and MPGS activity was detected in the flow-through. Active samples were loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column and eluted with a step gradient of potassium phosphate buffer (50–500 mm, pH 7.6). Fractions containing MPGS, eluted at 50 mm, were applied on a Q-Sepharose column (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and eluted with a linear gradient (0–1 m NaCl) in the same buffer. MPGS activity was detected in the fractions eluted at 0.4 m of NaCl. Hydrophobic Chromatography—The active fractions were dialyzed against Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.6) containing 0.5 m ammonium sulfate. The sample was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column, and elution was carried out with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (0.5–0 m). MPGS activity was detected at 0.26 m of (NH4)2SO4. High Resolution Ion Exchange Chromatography—A Mono Q column (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) was used; the enzyme eluted at 0.45 m NaCl with a linear gradient (0–1 m NaCl). The active fractions were applied onto a Mono S column (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5). MPGS activity eluted at 0.35 m NaCl. The amino acid sequences of the N terminus and of two internal fragments were determined (20Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar). Molecular mass was determined by SELDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Microchemical Facility, Emory University School of Medicine). Identification of the mpgs and mpgp Genes—Degenerate primers based on the two internal amino acid sequences (FLNQLISYYTGFETE and GEEHIDDMILDDLQVIYH) of the purified native MPGS were designed. A degenerate reverse primer was designed based on a conserved region (REYSE) of known MPGPs (13Empadinhas N. Marugg J.D. Borges N. Santos H. da Costa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43580-43588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was isolated as described by Marmur (21Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). A 315-bp PCR fragment of mpgs was amplified, labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Applied Science) and used as a probe to screen a R. marinus genomic library (17Martins L.O. Empadinhas N. Marugg J.D. Miguel C. Ferreira C. da Costa M.S. Santos H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35407-35414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A 2.8-kilobase pair insert containing the entire mpgs gene plus a 42-bp fragment of the mpgp gene was obtained. The entire mpgp gene was obtained using a similar strategy. Cloning and Expression of mpgs, Truncated mpgs, and mpgp Genes— The full-length mpgs and mpgs lacking 99-bp in the C terminus region were amplified and cloned separately in pKK223-3 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) between the EcoRI and HindIII sites. The mpgp gene was cloned between the EcoRI and PstI sites. Cloning methodology followed standard protocols (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli BL-21DE cells bearing the constructs were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to an A600 of 0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—E. coli extracts were prepared as described above, but 1 mm dithiothreitol and 2 mm EDTA were added. The proteins were purified from heat-treated cell extracts (10 min at 70 °C) in three chromatographic steps: Q-Sepharose, Resource Q, and Superose 6. The purity of the final protein preparations was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Characterization of Recombinant Enzymes—The temperature profiles for activity were studied between 40 and 95 °C at pH 8.2. The pH profiles of MPGS and truncated MPGS were determined at 80 °C using 50 mm Bis/Tris/propane-HCl buffer in the pH range 5–10. The effect of pH on MPGP was determined at 80 °C using 50 mm Bis/Tris/propane-HCl buffer in the pH range 5–10 and 50 mm acetate buffer in the pH range 3–5. Long term stability was evaluated from the residual activity of the enzymes (0.84 mg/ml for MPGS, 0.2 mg/ml for truncated MPGS, and 0.5 mg/ml for MPGP) after heat treatment at 80 °C for different time periods. Kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) were determined under optimum conditions. All of the reactions were done in duplicate. Activation of MPGS by R. marinus Cell Extracts—The full-length MPGS (0.26 mg) was incubated at 72 °C for various periods of time with cell extracts of R. marinus (1.1 mg) grown at 65 °C in medium containing 2% NaCl. MPGS activity was assayed by 1H NMR as previously described. Activation of endogenous MPGS was also determined in control experiments. The activation measurements were also carried out in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors purchased from Roche Applied Science. To assess a potential activation of the enzyme by temperature alone, full-length MPGS was incubated at 72 °C with 1.0 mg of a thermostable protein (recombinant rubredoxin of Desulfovibrio gigas (23Lamosa P. Burke A. Peist R. Huber R. Liu M.Y. Silva G. Rodrigues-Pousada C. LeGall J. Maycock C. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)) to mimic the protein content in the R. marinus extracts. The experiments were repeated three times. Levels of Enzymes and Intracellular Solutes in Response to Heat or Osmotic Stress—The cells were grown to mid-exponential phase at the optimal temperature (65 °C) and NaCl concentration (2%). At this stage, the cultures were transferred to an incubator at 75 °C and grown further for 4 h. Osmotic stress conditions were imposed by the addition of a sterile NaCl solution to obtain a final concentration of 6% NaCl. The cells were grown further for 4 h under osmotic stress. Culture samples were withdrawn after 0, 2, and 4 h under stress conditions and used to determine protein (MGS and MPGS) levels by immunoblotting and to determine intracellular solutes by 1H NMR. The experiments were performed in duplicate. Western Blot Analysis—R. marinus cells were lysed by boiling in Laemmli′s buffer. After electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore) that were incubated overnight with rabbit primary antibodies (anti-MGS or anti-MPGS produced at Eurogentec). Binding was detected with an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) after treatment with anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The signals were quantified by using a program written in MatLab (MathWorks, Inc.). Sequence Analysis of mpgs and mpgp Genes—Two MPGS proteins with the same N-terminal amino acid sequence (MRIEIP) and with molecular masses of 48,795 and 45,584 Da, determined by mass spectrometry, were isolated from R. marinus extracts (Fig. 1). A 3.5-kilobase pair fragment of R. marinus carrying the mpgs (encoding MPGS) contiguous to mpgp (encoding MPGP) genes was isolated from the genomic library (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Nucleotide sequence of the mpg operon and flanking regions in R. marinus. The predicted start codons of mpgs and mpgp genes are indicated in boldtype. The N-terminal and two internal fragments sequenced after purification of native MPGS are underlined. The putative promoter region upstream of mpgs, predicted by using a prokaryotic promoter data base (www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html), is surrounded by a box, and the putative ribosome-binding site is labeled RBS. The deduced amino acid sequence is also shown. The DXD motif common to several glycosyltransferase families is highlighted with black shaded boxes. Conserved motifs of acid phosphatases are showed in gray boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) BLAST searches of the protein data bases with the R. marinus MPGS and MPGP amino acid sequences revealed high homology with several proteins (Fig. 3 and the supplemental figure). MPGS had 52% amino acid identity with MPGS from T. thermophilus, about 45% with MPGSs from three Pyrococcus spp., 36% with A. pernix, and 48% with an uncultured crenarchaeote. Given this considerable degree of identity, R. marinus MPGS should be classified in glycosyltransferase family GT55 (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cazy/CAZY/index.html), which comprises GDP-mannose:α-mannosyltransferases that retain the anomeric configuration of the substrate. Interestingly, the glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of other compatible solutes, such as trehalose and sucrose, are also “retaining” enzymes. The R. marinus MPGP had 43% identity with MPGP of T. thermophilus, about 38% with MPGPs of Pyrococcus spp., and 25% with MPGP of A. pernix. Despite the low degree of similarity with other osmolyte-phosphate phosphatases, R. marinus MPGP contains the two conserved motifs (DXDX(T/V)X and GDXXXD) that are characteristic of the phosphohydrolase superfamily designated “DDDD” (25Thaller M.C. Schippa S. Rossolini G.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Biochemical Characterization of Recombinant MPGS and MPGP—MPGS showed absolute substrate specificity for GDPmannose and d-3-phosphoglycerate. ADP-mannose, UDP-mannose, ADP-glucose, GDP-glucose, UDP-glucose, glycerate, glycerol, d-2-phosphoglycerate, l-glycerol-3-phosphate, 2,3-diphospho-d-glycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate were examined as potential substrates. The α-configuration of the final product, MPG, was established from the measurement of the coupling constant between the anomeric carbon, C1, and the directly bound proton, H1 (J = 171.8 Hz) (26Bock K. Pedersen C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1974; II: 293-297Crossref Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions (5 mm of each substrate), the maximum yield of MPG was only 67%. To investigate whether this incomplete conversion was due to product inhibition, MPGS activity was assessed in the presence of MPG plus GDP (1:1 ratio) or GDP alone. The activity of MPGS was inhibited by 50% at a GDP concentration of 2.5 mm; MPG (2.5 mm) or MG (5 mm) had no effect on the enzyme activity. The presence of Mg2+ was required for MPGS activity. NaCl (or KCl) were inhibitors of the enzyme (Table I). Maximal MPGS activity was observed at 80 °C and pH 7.5 (Fig. 4).Table IKinetic parameters and biochemical properties of recombinant MPGS, truncated MPGS, and MPGP from R. marinusPropertiesMPGSaAll assays were carried out at 80 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Truncated MPGSaAll assays were carried out at 80 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”MPGPaAll assays were carried out at 80 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Km (mm)bKm values for MPGS were determined in mixtures containing 0.1-5 mm GDP-mannose and 5 mm 3-PGA, or 5 mm GDP-mannose and 0.1-5 mm 3-PGA.

Several sugar phosphates, mannose-1-phosphate, mannose-6-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-1,6-bisphosphate, fructose-1-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, trehalose-6-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, GDP, and GMP, were examined as possible substrates for the enzyme. The dephosphorylation of MPG was complete under our experimental conditions, and the activity was not affected by 5 mm MG. MPGP was not strictly dependent on Mg2+, but its presence was required for maximal activity. Maximum activity was reached between 70 and 80 °C and pH 6.0 (Fig. 4). NaCl (or KCl) in the range of 0–150 mm had no effect on MPGP activity. Effect of the C-terminal Extension on MPGS Properties—The final protein preparation of the native MPGS showed two bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The molecular mass of the upper band matched the calculated molecular mass of the deduced amino acid sequence of full-length MPGS (427 amino acids), whereas the molecular mass of the lower band corresponded to MPGS lacking 30 amino acids in the C terminus region. Interestingly, the sequence alignment of the full-length MPGS with six homologous proteins showed a C-terminal extension of ∼30 amino acids (Fig. 3). Therefore, we deemed it important to investigate the biochemical features of truncated MPGS. The specific activity of MPGS lacking 33 amino acids in the C-terminal region was 156 μmol/min·mg protein at 80 °C and optimum pH (7.5), which represents a 10-fold increase as compared with the full-length MPGS. The pH profiles for activity were very similar, but the optimal temperature of the truncated MPGS was 10 °C higher than that of the full-length protein (Fig. 4). At 100 °C truncated MPGS retained 85% of its maximum activity, whereas the full-length protein showed no activity. Moreover, the long term stability of the truncated MPGS was much higher; the half-life for inactivation at 80 °C was 79 min to be compared with 40 min determined for the full-length MPGS (Table I). Activation of MPGS by R. marinus Cell Extracts—The dramatic increase observed in the specific activity of MPGS upon deletion of 33 amino acids in the C terminus led us to hypothesize that the activity of MPGS could be regulated in vivo by proteolysis. To obtain experimental evidence to support this hypothesis, the activation profile of full-length MPGS upon incubation with R. marinus cell extracts was studied (Fig. 5). The MPGS activity increased 3-fold upon a 20-min incubation at 72 °C, and this activation was completely abolished by a mixture of protease inhibitors; the extent of activation was calculated after subtracting the activation of endogenous MPGS under the same conditions (1.1-fold). Levels of MGS and MPGS in Response to Heat or Osmotic Stress—The levels of MGS and MPGS were estimated by Western blotting, after confirming that a purified preparation of anti-MGS and anti-MPGS specifically recognized the MGS and MPGS in cell extracts of R. marinus. The measurements were carried out in cells grown under optimum conditions (2% NaCl and 65 °C) and also after imposing upshifts in the salinity of the growth medium to 6% NaCl or in temperature to 75 °C. Constitutive levels of MGS and MPGS were detected under optimum growth conditions, but the amount of MGS, the synthase of the single-step pathway, was selectively enhanced by heat stress (2.5-fold higher after 2 h), whereas the synthase of the two-step pathway, MPGS, was overproduced in response to osmotic stress (3-fold increase in 2 h) (Fig. 6). The effect of these stress conditions on the intracellular levels of compatible solutes was also assessed in the same experiments (Fig. 7). The intracellular pool of MG increased notably during the initial 2-h period of adaptation to osmotic stress. In contrast, mannosylglyceramide was undetectable in cells under optimal conditions but increased primarily during the last hour of osmotic adaptation, reaching concentrations comparable with those of MG.Fig. 7Compatible solute accumulation in R. marinus cells subjected to osmotic or heat stress. Compatible solutes in aliquots of the cell suspensions used in the assays illustrated in Fig. 6 were quantified by 1H NMR in ethanolic cell extracts. Open squares, mannosylglycerate; open circles, mannosylglyceramide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The levels of MGS and MPGS were also evaluated in separate cell batches grown at different temperatures (57.5, 65, and 75 °C) and NaCl concentrations (1, 2, 4, and 6%). An increase in the growth temperature from 57.5 to 75 °C led to a 2-fold increase of MGS and a 20% decrease of MPGS. Conversely, the level of MPGS increased 3-fold in cells grown in medium containing 6% NaCl, compared with cells grown at optimal salinity (2% NaCl), whereas the level of MGS remained unchanged (data not shown). R. marinus is the only organism known to have two distinct pathways for the synthesis of MG. Herein, the genetic and biochemical characterization of the two-step pathway was achieved to elucidate the role of pathway duplicity in the strategies for osmo- and thermoadaptation of R. marinus. The arrangement of the genes involved in the synthesis of MG in R. marinus is similar to that of T. thermophilus (14Empadinhas N. Albuquerque L. Henne A. Santos H. da Costa M.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3272-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), A. pernix, and Pyrococcus horikoshii (13Empadinhas N. Marugg J.D. Borges N. Santos H. da Costa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43580-43588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) insofar as the mpgp gene is found immediately downstream of the mpgs gene. However, the operon-like structure of Pyrococcus spp., comprising the genes encoding the enzymes involved in the synthesis of GDP-mannose from fructose-6-phosphate, was not found in R. marinus. In this respect, the gene organization of R. marinus is most similar to that found in the bacterium T. thermophilus and the crenarchaeote A. pernix. An unrooted phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of the alignment of the amino acid sequences of known MPGSs predicts the existence of three different clusters (Fig. 8). As expected, the bacterial MPGSs (R. marinus and T. thermophilus) group together, and the archaeal MPGSs from Pyrococcus spp. form a tight cluster. On the other hand, the MPGS of the uncultured crenarchaeote and of A. pernix form distinct branches from the other homologues. It appears, therefore, that the archaeal mpgs genes have more divergent sequences than the bacterial counterparts. However, this preliminary analysis should be regarded with caution for the lack of a larger number of sequences. The observation that recombinant R. marinus MPGS had a specific activity 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the homologous enzymes from P. horikoshii and T. thermophilus (13Empadinhas N. Marugg J.D. Borges N. Santos H. da Costa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43580-43588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Empadinhas N. Albuquerque L. Henne A. Santos H. da Costa M.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3272-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) is rather intriguing. Several hypotheses can be put forward to explain this result: (i) The heterologous host used for overproduction may lack the machinery required for correct translation and/or folding. However, the specific MPGS activity was unchanged after an unfolding/refolding procedure with guanidinium chloride, suggesting that MPGS was synthesized in E. coli with the correct folding (data not shown). (ii) R. marinus MPGS could have a much lower intrinsic specific activity than P. horikoshii and T. thermophilus MPGSs and yet be sufficient to support the required synthesis of MG. (iii) Finally, the low activity could be due to a lack of suitable post-translational modifications in E. coli. The hint for this proposition was provided by the purification of two size forms of native MPGS with identical N termini and a molecular mass that differed by ∼30 residues (Fig. 1). This view was further supported by the existence of about 30 extra amino acids in the C terminus of R. marinus MPGS that are not found in other MPGSs (Fig. 3). Moreover, R. marinus MPGS contains an arginine-rich region in the C terminus that could be an adequate proteolytic cleavage site. We therefore hypothesized that a proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal extension was the underlying cause for activation of the enzyme. Experimental evidence for this idea was the strong enhancement of the catalytic activity (10-fold) achieved by truncation of the C-terminal extension of MPGS. This result led us to question whether proteolytic cleavage could play a role in the activation of the enzyme in vivo. It is worth recalling that several enzymes involved in the synthesis of sugar or sugar-derivative osmolytes are activated by proteolysis. Activation of galactosyl-1-glycerol-3-phosphate synthase from Poterioochromonas malhamensis is attributed to the action of a membrane-bound protease (27Köhle D. Kauss H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 799: 59-67Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Trehalose-phosphate synthase from baker’s yeast, produced as a proprotein with 115 kDa, is activated (approximately 3-fold) by the action of an endogenous protease with concomitant reduction of 20 kDa in size (28Londesborough J. Vuorio O. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The homologous synthase from Candida utilis is also activated by the action of a specific protease (29Vicente-Soler J. Arguelles J.C. Gacto M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 82: 157-162Google Scholar). Despite all the evidence we gathered in support for a mechanism of proteolytic activation of R. marinus MPGS, the observation of only the less active form of MPGS (full-length protein) in all the Western blotting assays remains intriguing. One could speculate that, in vivo, the inhibitory effect of the C-terminal extension would be eliminated without implying the actual cleavage of a peptide bond; for example, the interaction with a regulatory protein could lead to the conformational change required to relieve the inhibition of the catalytic domain. Although the fine details of the regulatory mechanism of MPGS remain elusive, we did show that: (i) the C-terminal peptide is implicated in the regulation of the catalytic activity of MPGS and (ii) cell extracts of R. marinus possess the proteolytic machinery to activate the full-length MPGS by cleavage of the C-terminal extension. Several sugar-derivative osmolytes from mesophiles are synthesized predominantly by a two-step pathway involving a phosphorylated intermediate (8Curatti L. Folco E. Desplats P. Abratti G. Limones V. Herrera-Estrella L. Salerno G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6776-6779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Giæver H.M. Styrvold O.B. Kaasen I. Strøm A.R. J.

Schoor A. Erdmann N. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to this one, R. marinus has a second pathway for the synthesis of MG, and the reason for pathway duality is explained in the present work. We found that the two-step and single-step pathways have specific roles in the adaptation of R. marinus to different types of stress, namely, osmotic stress and heat stress, respectively. R. marinus cells respond to heat stress by selectively enhancing the levels of MGS (the enzyme of the single-step pathway), whereas osmotic stress had a pronounced effect only in the induction of the synthesis of MPGS (the synthase of the two-step pathway). In eukaryotes, a well known strategy for adaptation to different stressful conditions involves the utilization of isoenzymes, which catalyze the same reaction but are differentially regulated by diverse types of stress. For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the two glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzymes involved in the synthesis of glycerol play a dominant role in different stressful situations; one is primarily produced for osmoadaptation, and the other is primarily produced for adaptation to anoxic conditions (30Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In bacteria, pathway multiplicity for trehalose synthesis has been reported in a few cases: mycobacteria (31De Smet K.A.L. Weston A. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), Corynebacterium glutamicum (32Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and T. thermophilus (33Silva Z. Alarico S. Nobre A. Horlacher R. Marugg J. Boos W. Mingote A.I. da Costa M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the multiplicity of routes used to synthesize the same metabolite underlines the physiological importance of the final product. Yet the significance of the metabolic multiplicity is generally elusive. In this context, a careful, recent study proposes that among the three routes for the synthesis of trehalose in C. glutamicum, the maltooligosyltrehalose synthase:trehalohydrolase pathway is involved in osmoadaptation, the trehalose synthase pathway is important for trehalose degradation, and the role of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase pathway remains unclear (32Wolf A. Krämer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It appears that R. marinus has developed an ingenious strategy to cope with stress imposed by salt or heat. To our knowledge this is the only example of pathway multiplicity being rationalized in terms of the need to respond efficiently to distinct environmental aggressions. This finding also reinforces the view that MG plays a dual role in osmoadaptation and thermoadaptation of R. marinus. In Pyrococcus spp., the level of MG increases dramatically with the NaCl concentration in the growth medium, but MG appears to have a negligible contribution to protection against heat stress (4Martins L.O. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3299-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Empadinhas N. Marugg J.D. Borges N. Santos H. da Costa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43580-43588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unlike Pyrococcus spp., R. marinus accumulates MG in response to both osmotic and heat stress; thermoprotection appears to be provided exclusively by MG, whereas MG and mannosylglyceramide contribute to osmoadaptation (2Silva Z. Borges N. Martins L.O. Wait R. da Costa M.S. Santos H. Extremophiles. 1999; 3: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This conclusion is fully corroborated by the profile of accumulation of these solutes in response to osmotic or heat shock (Fig. 7). In conclusion, the two alternative pathways for the synthesis of MG are differently regulated at the level of expression to play specific roles in the adaptation of R. marinus to two different types of aggression. Moreover, we have shown that the 30-amino acid peptide in the C terminus of MPGS is a regulatory site for short term control of MG synthesis. These results represent an important step toward the full elucidation of mechanisms of osmo- and thermoadaptation in thermophilic organisms, an ambitious goal that can be achieved with the development of genetic tools for manipulation of R. marinus.

Nevertheless, a complete electrophysiological characterization of the basic properties of hCNT1-mediated translocation has not been performed yet, and the exact role of adenosine in hCNT1 function has not been addressed either. In the present work we have used the two-electrode voltage clamp technique to investigate hCNT1 transport mechanism and study the kinetic properties of adenosine as an inhibitor of hCNT1.

Adenosine, a purine nucleoside described as a substrate of the pyrimidine-preferring transporters, is not a substrate of hCNT1 but a high affinity blocker able to inhibit uridine-induced inward currents, the Na+-leak currents, and the presteady-state currents, with a Ki of 6.5 μm. The kinetic parameters for uridine, gemcitabine, and 5′-deoxy-5-fluorouridine were studied as a function of membrane potential; at -50 mV, K0.5 was 37, 18, and 245 μm, respectively, and remained voltage-independent. Imax for gemcitabine was voltage-independent and accounts for ∼40% that for uridine at -50 mV.

Therefore, the detailed electrophysiological analysis of hCNT1-mediated substrate translocation and inhibitor interaction will be helpful in the understanding of the minimal structural requirements of substrates and inhibitors, thus contributing to improve therapeutics using hCNT1 as a pharmacological target. We previously reported that the human Na+/nucleoside transporter pyrimidine-preferring 1 (hCNT1) is electrogenic (6Lostao M.P. Mata J.F. Larrayoz I.M. Inzillo S.M. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M.

In the present work we have used electrophysiological methods to characterize hCNT1 and show the presteady-state currents, directly determine the Na+-nucleoside stoichiometry, and study the kinetic properties of natural nucleosides and relevant nucleoside-derived drugs. A major finding of this contribution is also the unequivocal demonstration that adenosine is not a hCNT1 substrate but can efficiently block the uptake of pyrimidine nucleosides. Although the impact of this inhibition in physiology and pharmacology still has to be elucidated, this finding anticipates new physiological roles for adenosine besides its well known actions as purinergic agonist. Expression of hCNT1 in Xenopus laevis Oocytes and Uptake Assays— Stage VI oocytes from X. laevis (Blades Biological, Cowden, UK) were obtained as previously described (13Birnir B. Loo D.D.

They were microinjected with 30–50 ng of mRNA coding for the human Na+/nucleoside cotransporter 1, hCNT1 (6Lostao M.P. Mata J.F. Larrayoz I.M. Inzillo S.M. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M.

Experiments were performed at 22 ± 1 °C 2–7 days after the injection. Nucleoside uptake was measured by a radiotracer method (14Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr.

Briefly, groups of 6–10 oocytes were incubated for 1 h in 400 μl of Na+ buffer solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5) containing [3H]uridine (specific activity, 36.0 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or [3H]adenosine (specific activity 23.0 Ci/mmol; Sigma) at the indicated concentrations. Inhibition of uridine uptake by adenosine was measured by adding the non-radiolabeled adenosine (2 mm) to the uptake solution containing the radiolabeled uridine (50 μm). After the incubation period had elapsed, the 3H content of each oocyte was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Uptakes are expressed as pmol/oocyte h. Electrophysiology—The electrophysiology experiments were performed using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp method (13Birnir B. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. Pfluegers Arch. 1991; 418: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr.

A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The oocyte membrane potential was normally held at a holding potential (Vh) of -50 mV, and continuous current data were recorded using Axoscope V1.1.1.14 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). To obtain current/voltage relationship, 11 pulses of potential (test potential) between +50 and -150 mV (-20-mV decrement) were applied for 100 ms using pClamp 6 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The jump from the holding potential to the test potential generates the “on” current, and the return from the test potential to the holding potential, before the next jump, generates the “off” current. Steady-state Kinetics—The apparent affinity constant (K0.5S) and the maximal current (ImaxS) for saturating nucleoside concentrations were obtained by fitting the steady-state currents (I) at each membrane potential to the equation, I=ImaxS⋅[S]n/(K0.5S)n+[S]nEq. 1 where [S] is the nucleoside concentration (seven concentrations, from 2 μm to 1 or 5 mm, depending on the nucleoside), and n is the Hill coefficient, which for nucleoside kinetic analysis is 1. The fit was performed using the non-linear fitting method in SigmaPlot 8 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Uridine, cytidine, thymidine, adenosine, and 5′-DFUR were purchased from Sigma, and gemcitabine was from University Hospital (University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain). For Na+ activation experiments saturating concentrations of uridine (0.25 or 0.5 mm) were applied as NaCl concentration was varied between 0 and 100 mm (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5, 20, and 100 mm), substituting choline for Na+. Uridine-dependent currents at each voltage were fit to Equation 1, where in this case I is the uridine-induced steady-state current, ImaxS is maximal uridine current at saturating Na+ concentrations, [S] is the Na+ concentration, and K0.5S is the sodium concentration at half-maximal current. The apparent inhibition constant, Ki, for adenosine was determined at -50-mV membrane potential by measuring uridine or thymidine (0.25 or 0.50 mm)-induced currents in the presence of different adenosine concentrations (25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 2500 μm) by continuous current recording. Because uridine/thymidine steady-state currents slowly decreased with time (Figs. 1B and 6A), the perfusion of uridine/thymidine in the presence of each adenosine concentration was performed following the Na+ buffer wash out after the substrate-induced current had been recorded. The concentration of inhibitor required to block nucleoside current by 50% (IC50) was first obtained and used to calculate the Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, Ki=IC50/(1+[S]/K0.5S)Eq. 2 where K0.5S is the affinity constant for uridine or thymidine, and [S] the uridine or thymidine concentration.Fig. 6Charge-to-nucleoside and charge-to-Na+ stoichiometry for hCNT1.A, a representative experiment showing [3H]uridine-induced inward current in an hCNT1-expressing oocyte. Membrane potential was held at -50 mV, and oocyte perfused with Na+ buffer and a stable base-line current were recorded. The addition of 0.25 mm uridine increased the inward current to ∼175 nA. After 8 min uridine was removed from the bath by perfusing uridine-free Na+ buffer, and the current returned to base line. The transported charge, Q, was calculated as the integral of the nucleoside-dependent current over 8 min and was 8.4 × 10-5 C. The [3H]uridine uptake in this oocyte was 0.45 nmol after subtraction of [3H]uridine uptake over the same period in non-injected oocytes. B, charge-to-nucleoside stoichiometry of hCNT1. Uptake of 0.25 mm [3H]uridine or [3H]thymidine in the presence of 100 mm Na+ was measured for 5–10 min as indicated in A. The membrane potential was held at -50 mV. The nucleoside dependent charge (Qnucleoside) was plotted against the uptake of the nucleoside. Each point corresponds to one oocyte after subtraction of the non-injected oocyte uptake. The data were fit to a linear regression with a slope of 1.85 ± 0.18 charges/nucleoside. C, charge-to-Na+ stoichiometry of hCNT1. The uridine-dependent charge and 22Na uptake were simultaneously determined at -90 mV membrane potential in different hCNT1-expressing oocytes. The uridine concentration was 0.5 mm, and the Na+ concentration 1 mm. The data were fit to a linear regression with a slope of 1.07 ± 0.14 charges/Na+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Presteady-state Currents—The presteady-state transient currents observed after voltage steps are attributed to changes in the conformation of the transporter (15Parent L.

These capacitive currents were separated from the membrane capacitance and the steady state conductances using the fitted method (16Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The transporter-mediated charge at each membrane potential was then calculated by integrating the transporter-transient currents with time. In most cases, the “off” transient was analyzed. The charge-voltage (Q/V) relations obtained were fit to the Boltzmann equation, Q-Qhyp=Qmax[1-exp(z(Vt-V0.5)F/RT)]Eq. 3 where Qmax = Qdep - Qhyp, Qdep and Qhyp are the charge moved at depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits respectively, z is the apparent valence of the transporter, Vt is the test potential, V0.5 is the voltage at which the charge was equally distributed between depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits, F is Faraday's constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Charge/voltage relationship in the presence of adenosine (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 100, and 1000 μm) was obtained for each concentration, and ΔQmax was calculated as the difference between Qmax in the absence and presence of adenosine. ΔQmax was plotted against adenosine concentration, and the data were fit to Equation 1 to obtain the binding constant for adenosine, KD, where I corresponds to ΔQmax at each adenosine concentration, [S] is the adenosine concentration, K0.5S is the binding constant, and n = 1. Stoichiometry—To determine Na+-to-nucleoside-coupling stoichiometry we directly compared unidirectional ligand uptakes (22Na or [3H]uridine) into voltage-clamped oocytes to the cotransporter (substrate-induced) currents over the same time course in individual cells (18Mackenzie B. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Díez-Sampedro A. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Hirayama B.A. Am. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37414-37422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The nonspecific uptakes of [3H]uridine and 22Na in non-injected oocytes were <1% of the hCNT1-specific uptakes. Charge-to-nucleoside Stoichiometry—The oocyte was voltage-clamped at -50 mV and superfused with 100 mm Na+ medium. When the base line was stable, 0.5 mm [3H]uridine or [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 87.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the Na+ solution at a final concentration of 1.4 nCi/μl. After 8–10 min the nucleoside was removed from the bathing solution, and the oocyte was superfused with Na+ buffer until the current returned to the base line. The oocyte was recovered from the chamber, rinsed three times in ice-cold choline buffer, and solubilized with 10% SDS for liquid scintillation counting. Uptake was expressed as pmol/oocyte. [3H]Uridine or [3H]thymidine uptake in non-injected oocytes was used to correct for endogenous uridine uptake. Nucleoside-induced current was obtained as the difference in current between base line and after the addition of nucleoside and was integrated to obtain total nucleoside-dependent charge (Qnucleoside). This charge was converted to its molar equivalent using Faraday’s constant. Charge-to-Na+Stoichiometry—Uptake of 22Na was optimized for specific activity and transport rate by using a saturating concentration of uridine (0.5 mm) and a 22Na concentration of 1 mm, close to the K0.5Na+. The oocyte was clamped at -90 mV and superfused with 1 mm Na+ medium. A stable base-line current was recorded, and then the bath solution was changed to 0.5 mm uridine with 1 mm22Na (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) medium at a final concentration of 1.4 nCi/μl. After 6–10 min the solution was changed back to the Na+ medium until the current returned to base line. The oocyte was washed and solubilized as described above. The charge associated with the 22Na uptake induced by uridine was the difference between base-line and uridine current, whereas 22Na was present. Net charge transported into the oocyte was obtained by integrating the inward current produced by the nucleoside uptake in the oocyte. Charge was converted to its molar equivalent by using Faraday’s constant. 22Na uptake in non-injected oocytes was used to correct for endogenous 22Na uptake. Interaction of Adenosine with hCNT1—Adenosine is a purine nucleoside that had been described as a substrate of the pyrimidine-preferring nucleoside transport system later identified as CNT1. Nevertheless, discrepancy on the published data and our preliminary results prompted us to investigate whether adenosine was transported by hCNT1. Fig. 1A shows uptake of 50 μm [3H]uridine by oocytes expressing hCNT1 (187 ± 16 pmol/oocyte·h), but no uptake of 50 or 250 μm [3H]adenosine was found. However, 2 mm adenosine was able to inhibit uptake of 50 μm uridine by 90%, indicating that this nucleoside is not transported by hCNT1, but it can bind to the transporter. We further demonstrated that adenosine is not a hCNT1 substrate by electrophysiological methods. A hCNT1-expressing oocyte was clamped at -50 mV and continuously perfused with Na+ buffer inducing a base-line current that corresponds to the Na+-leak current in the absence of substrate. (Fig. 1B). The addition of 0.5 mm uridine evoked an inward current of ∼90 nA. This current and the base-line current disappeared when the oocyte was washed out with Na+-free buffer. The addition of Na+ buffer returned the current to the base line. Adenosine at 1 mm concentration, however, did not evoke any inward current, indicating that is not transported. We then performed experiments to obtain the apparent inhibition constant, Ki, for adenosine. Fig. 1C shows the uridine (0.25 mm)-induced current inhibited by different adenosine concentrations as a function of those concentrations in an oocyte clamped at -50 mV. For this oocyte IC50 was 73 ± 13 μm, and KiA, obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was 9.4 ± 1.7 μm. The mean KiA of three different determinations was 6.4 ± 1.1 μm. Another way to determine adenosine affinity constant for hCNT1 is from the inhibition of the presteady-state currents. These currents reflect voltage-dependent processes due to charge movements caused by Na+ binding/dissociation and conformational changes involved in the reorientation of the ligand binding sites of the cotransporter in the membrane. Fig. 2A shows the current traces recorded after step changes in the membrane voltage in an oocyte held at -50 mV and perfused with Na+ buffer in the absence of substrate. The steady-state currents at 100 ms correspond to the Na+ leak currents as it has been observed in many other cation-coupled transporters. Presteady-state currents can also be observed, especially at depolarizing membrane potentials. The addition of 10 mm uridine increased the steady-state inward currents and inhibited the presteady-state currents (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C represents the steady-state currents for uridine as a function of voltage. These currents were obtained as the difference between the currents registered in the presence and absence of the nucleoside and increased as the membrane potential was more negative. Fig. 2, D and E, also show, in a different oocyte, the current traces recorded in the absence (Fig. 2D) and presence of 1 mm adenosine (Fig. 2E). As uridine, adenosine inhibited the presteady-state currents; however, unlike uridine, adenosine did not induce inward currents (see also Fig. 1B) but inhibited the Na+-leak current. This is shown as positive currents obtained as the difference between the steady-state currents in the presence and absence of adenosine, which increased at hyperpolarizing membrane potentials (Fig. 2F). Notice that in Fig. 1B adenosine does not inhibit the Na+-leak current due to a lower expression level of the transporter in that oocyte compared with the oocyte in Fig. 2F. Charge movement as a function of membrane potential was obtained by the integration of the presteady-state current records in the absence and presence of adenosine 1, 2, 5, 10, 100, and 1000 μm. The Qmax in the absence of adenosine was ∼24 nanocoulombs and decreased with adenosine concentration to ∼16, 11, and 5 nanocoulombs in the presence of 2, 10, and 20 μm uridine, respectively (Fig. 3A). V0.5, however, did not change with increasing concentrations of adenosine: -90 ± 5 mV in the absence of nucleoside and -93 ± 5, -95 ± 5, and -114 ± 5 mV in the presence of 2, 10, and 20 μm adenosine respectively. Fitting the ΔQmax data to adenosine concentration (Fig. 3B) indicated a binding constant, KDA, of 5.6 ± 0.9 μm (mean of four determinations, 6.5 ± 1 μm), a value close to the KiA previously obtained. All these results indicated that adenosine is not a substrate of hCNT1 but is a high affinity blocker able to inhibit uridine-induced inward currents, the Na+-leak currents, and the presteady-state currents observed in hCNT1. Kinetic Parameters for Nucleosides and Na+as a Function of Membrane Potential—We had previously demonstrated that the drugs gemcitabine and 5′-DFUR are substrates of hCNT1. In the present work we studied the influence of the membrane potential on the kinetic parameters for the two nucleoside derivatives. Fig. 4A shows the K0.5S/V relationship for the two drugs and uridine. K0.5S is voltage-independent at hyperpolarizing membrane potentials for the three nucleosides, for gemcitabine, around half that for uridine, and for 5′-DFUR, one order of magnitude higher. At -50 mV K0.5S values were 11 ± 4, 27 ± 5, and 268 ± 84 μm for gemcitabine, uridine, and 5′-DFUR, respectively (Fig. 4A). Imax was voltage-dependent for uridine (Fig. 4, B and C) and thymidine (data not shown) but was voltage-independent for gemcitabine (Fig. 4B) and cytidine (data not shown). Maximal current for gemcitabine was 49 and 25% that for uridine at -50 and -150 mV, respectively (Fig. 4B), and Imax for 5′-DFUR was ∼170% that for uridine at all membrane potentials (Fig. 4C). Table I summarizes the K0.5 values and maximal currents in percentage of uridine current at saturating concentrations for the three natural substrates of hCNT1 and the two nucleoside-derived drugs at -50 mV of membrane potential. The three natural nucleosides uridine, cytidine, and thymidine show the same affinity. However, cytidine induces half of the uridine and thymidine maximal currents. Gemcitabine, a cytidine-derived drug, shows a decrease in both K0.5 (2-fold) and Imax (2.5-fold) compared with uridine. The other nucleoside, 5′-DFUR, is a uridine-derived capecitabine metabolite that shows a higher affinity constant (one order of magnitude) and maximal current (1.5-fold) than uridine.Table IStructures and apparent affinity constant for natural substrates and drugs Electrophysiological experiments performed to determine whether H+, K+, or Cl- are involved in the nucleoside transport and contribute to generate the current revealed that none of them altered the nucleoside-induced current (data not shown). Therefore, Na+ is the only ion coupled to nucleoside transport. The kinetic parameters of Na+ as a function of voltage were also obtained. K0.5Na+ was voltage-independent at hyperpolarized membrane potentials (Fig. 5A), 1.3 ± 0.4 and 0.46 ± 0.28 mm at -50 and -150 mV, respectively. ImaxNa+ was voltage-dependent (Fig. 5B), -55 ± 5 and -113 ± 14 nA at -50 and -150 mV, respectively. The apparent affinity constant for Na+ obtained as the mean from four different determination was 1.2 ± 0.2 mm at -50 mV membrane potential. hCNT1 Stoichiometry—To determine charge/nucleoside stoichiometry we measured nucleoside-induced current and [3H]uridine or 22Na uptake in the same hCNT1-expressing oocyte over the equal time course. Fig. 6A shows an example of an oocyte clamped at -50 mV and superfused with 100 mm Na+ buffer, which produced the base-line current due to the Na+ leak. The addition of 0.5 mm [3H]uridine induced an inward current of ∼175 nA. When the nucleoside was removed from the bath the current returned to the base line. The current was integrated with time to determine the nucleoside-dependent net charge influx (Qnucleoside) that was 8.4 × 10-5 coulombs of positive charge. This charge was converted to its molar equivalent, 0.87 nmol, and compared with the nucleoside [3H]uridine uptake, 0.48 nmol, resulting in a charge-to-nucleoside ratio of 1.81:1 for this oocyte. The same process was repeated with 21 oocytes and [3H]uridine or [3H]thymidine concentrations of 0.5 or 0.25 mm. All the data were fitted to a single regression line. For all oocytes tested, the value of Qnucleoside/nucleoside uptake was 1.85 ± 0.18 (Fig. 6B), indicating that two net inward pos"

We found that a POZ domain protein, factor that binds to inducer of short transcripts-1 (FBI-1), was induced during both murine and human preadipocyte differentiation with maximal expression levels seen at days 2–4. FBI-1 mRNA was expressed in human adipose tissue with the highest levels found in samples from morbidly obese subjects. Murine cell lines constitutively expressing FBI-1 showed evidence for accelerated adipogenesis with earlier induction of markers of differentiation and enhanced lipid accumulation, suggesting that FBI-1 may be an active participant in the differentiation process. Consistent with the properties of this family of proteins in other cell systems, 3T3L1 cells stably overexpressing FBI-1 showed reduced DNA synthesis and reduced expression of cyclin A, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, and p107, proteins known to be involved in the regulation of mitotic clonal expansion. In addition, FBI-1 reduced the transcriptional activity of the cyclin A promoter. Thus, FBI-1, a POZ zinc finger transcription factor, is induced during the early phases of human and murine preadipocyte differentiation where it may contribute to adipogenesis through influencing the switch from cellular proliferation to terminal differentiation.

Rather than being viewed as a simple storage depot for excess energy, adipose tissue is now seen as playing an active role in the control of energy homeostasis and in the mediation of the adverse consequences of obesity (1Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms governing adipocyte function and differentiation are therefore the subject of increasingly intensive research. As is the case with other mesenchymal cells, adipocyte differentiation involves a two-step process. During the initial proliferation phase, growth-arrested preadipocytes re-enter the cell cycle and complete two rounds of cell division, a process known as mitotic clonal expansion. This is followed by the terminal differentiation phase in which the specific genes that define the adipocyte phenotype are induced (2Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A common feature of POZ zinc finger proteins is their ability to repress transcription via the amino-terminal POZ domain. This domain enables the protein to interact with co-repressors like the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors resulting in activation of a histone deacetylase complex and thereby gene silencing (9Melnick A.

Members of the POZ zinc finger transcription factors have been implicated in promoting growth arrest and terminal differentiation in several tissues. In hematopoiesis, the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein is induced during normal megakaryocytic development and promotes differentiation of these cells (10Labbaye C. Quaranta M.T. Pagliuca A. Militi S. Licht J.D. Testa U. Peschle C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6669-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Another POZ zinc finger protein, the B-cell lymphoma-6 protein, was found to be up-regulated during myogenesis (11Albagli-Curiel O. Dhordain P. Lantoine D. Aurade F. Quief S. Kerckaert J.P.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and experimental data suggest that this factor facilitates the differentiation of proliferating myoblasts into mature skeletal muscle cells (11Albagli-Curiel O. Dhordain P. Lantoine D. Aurade F. Quief S. Kerckaert J.P. Montarras D. Pinset C. Differentiation. 1998; 64: 33-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally the osteoclast-derived zinc finger protein was identified in osteoclastogenesis where it is involved in the fusion of mononuclear precursor cells into multinuclear mature cells (6Kukita A. Kukita T. Ouchida M. Maeda H. Yatsuki H. Kohashi O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the POZ zinc finger family of transcription factors have not, to our knowledge, been previously implicated in adipogenesis. Here we present evidence for a role of FBI-1 in human and murine preadipocyte differentiation. Our data suggest that this transcription factor facilitates adipogenesis and might be involved in termination of the initial mitotic clonal expansion phase and subsequent induction of terminal differentiation. Preparation, Culture, and Differentiation of Human Preadipocytes— Adipose tissue samples were obtained from metabolically healthy subjects undergoing elective open abdominal surgery. All subjects were fasted for 6 h prior to the operation, and all underwent general anesthesia. Cambridge Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained. All patients gave their informed consent. Adipose tissue biopsies were taken under sterile conditions and were transported into the laboratory in normal saline. After dicing the tissue into 1–2-mm pieces, samples were digested in collagenase solution (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 3 mg/ml collagenase (type II, Sigma), and 1.5% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently the digest was filtered through a 260-μm stainless steel mesh and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet containing the stromovascular fraction was treated with red cell lysis buffer (0.154 m NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA) for 5 min at room temperature. After centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 (1:1), 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin), and isolated preadipocytes were inoculated into 75-cm2 flasks. Medium was changed every 2 days. Cells were passaged four times before they were cultured to confluence. 3 days postconfluence, differentiation was induced by adding serum-free differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 (1:1), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 33 μm biotin, 17 μm pantothenic acid, 10 μg/ml human apotransferrin, 0.2 nm triiodothyronine, 100 nm cortisol, 500 nm insulin, 100 nm BRL49653 (rosiglitazone), 100 nm LG100268). For the first 3 days of culture, 0.25 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine was also added to the medium. For the microarray experiment, preadipocytes were divided into two groups prior to induction of differentiation, and 100 nm BRL49653 (rosiglitazone, in Me2SO) was added to the differentiation medium in one group, and vehicle (Me2SO) was added to the control group, respectively. No LG100268 was added in the microarray experiment. Oligonucleotide Microarray Expression Analysis—Gene expression analysis was performed as described in the Affymetrix® Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Total RNA was extracted from both the rosiglitazone-treated and control cells by the TRIzol method and purified using RNeasy minicolumns (Qiagen). RNA from four individuals was pooled and reverse transcribed (Superscript Choice system (Invitrogen)) using a T7 (dT)24 primer. The obtained cDNA was used as a template to generate biotinylated cRNA (T7 Megascript kit, Ambion). After fragmentation, biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to U95A gene chips (Affymetrix). Fluorescence intensities were measured with a gene array scanner (Affymetrix). Before any comparison was made between either of the two probe arrays, each probe array was analyzed independently (absolute analysis) using the Affymetrix gene chip absolute analysis software. To accurately compare the results from both probe arrays, each probe array was normalized in terms of the average intensity. For comparative analysis the probe array in which the vehicle sample was hybridized was called the base line. The comparison data were used to derive a difference call for each transcript, and a -fold change was given for each transcript. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared by the TRIzol method (human cells) or RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, 3T3-L1 cells) and reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The RT-PCR conditions were established in our laboratory to allow comparison between the expression levels of human and mouse FBI-1 (forward, 5′-GCAGATGGATGTCATCGGTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCACCTTCAGCTTGTCCTGCC-3′), human ISGF-3 (forward, 5′-GCTCGTTTGTGGTGGAAAGACAGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGCTGGCTGACGTTGGAGATCACC-3′), human fatty acid-binding protein (FABP)-4 (forward, 5′-GGAAAATCAACCACCATAAAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGAGAAAATTATGGCTTGCTA-3′), and GAPDH transcripts (human and mouse primers purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Under these conditions, the efficiency of the RT-PCR for each gene did not plateau, and the number of cycles in these experiments were kept to a minimum. The PCR was performed using 100 ng of cDNA and Biotaq® polymerase (Bioline). The cycle conditions were the following: denaturation, 1 min at 94 °C; annealing, 1 min at 55 °C; elongation, 1 min at 72 °C. Molecular Cloning—The cDNA of human FBI-1 was kindly provided by N. Hernandez (3Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 4Morrison D.J. Pendergrast P.S. Stavropoulos P. Colmenares S.U.

The coding region was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primers: forward, 5′-ATGGCCGGCGGCGTGGACGGC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTAGGCGAGTCCGGCTGTGAA-3′ in 5% Me2SO. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T-easy (Promega), and integrity was confirmed by sequencing. The coding region was then excised from pGEM-T-easy-FBI-1 and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 and pBabe-Puro. Culture, Differentiation, and Infection of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes— 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (13Nugent C. Prins J.B. Whitehead J.P. Savage D. Wentworth J.M. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1729-1738PubMed Google Scholar). FBI-1-overexpressing and control 3T3-L1 cell lines were generated using the pBabe-Puro retroviral vector system as described previously (14Xu H. Sethi J.K. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26287-26295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cells were kept in puromycin-containing medium until differentiation into adipocytes was induced. No puromycin was added during differentiation. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—Control cells and FBI-1-overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate, and at the given time points, medium was replaced by medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine. After incubation for 1 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) followed by an incubation for 30 min in 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. Subsequently cells were washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized with 0.2 m NaOH. After neutralization using 0.4 m HCl, activity was measured by scintillation counting. Western Blotting—Cells were washed twice with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 800 mm benzamide, 100 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 4 °C at 10,000 × g for 10 min, equal amounts of protein were solved in Laemmli buffer, heated to 100 °C, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). The following antibodies were used according to the instructions of the manufacturer: antiperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ (sc-7273, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (sc-61, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin A (sc-751, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 2 (sc-163, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-E2F-4 (sc-866, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p130 (sc-317, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-p107 (sc-318, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The anti-aP2 antibody was kindly provided by D. A. Bernlohr and used at a dilution of 1:5000 in PBS + 1% milk. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako and used at a 1:5000 dilution in PBS + 1% milk. Promoter-Reporter Gene Assay—HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. For transient transfection experiments using FuGENE® (Roche Applied Science), cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 80% confluency. A promoter-reporter gene construct carrying the firefly luciferase under control of the mouse cyclin A promoter was kindly provided by M. Schorpp-Kistner (15Andrecht S. Kolbus A. Hartenstein B. Angel P. Schorpp-Kistner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35961-35968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 0.1 μg of this plasmid was used, and 0–0.3 μg of pcDNA3.1-FBI-1 was used. To correct for transfection efficiency, 2 ng/well pRL-CMV (Promega) were co-transfected. Equal amounts of plasmid DNA per well were obtained by adding appropriate amounts of pcDNA3.1. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed by passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was detected in a luminometer (EG Berthold) using the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Taqman® Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA preparation, reverse transcription, and conditions for Taqman real time reverse transcription PCR were performed as described previously (16Sewter C.P. Blows F. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Expression levels of aP2 and PPARγ2 in mouse 3T3-L1 cells were determined using the following primers and probes: aP2: forward primer, 5′-CACCGCAGACGACAGGAAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCACCTGCACCAGGGC-3′; probe, 5′-TGAAGAGCATCATAACCCTAGATGGCGG-3′; PPARγ2: forward primer, 5′-GATGCACTGCCTATGAGCACTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGAGGTCCACAGAGCTGATTCC-3′; probe, 5′-AGAGATGCCATTCTGGCCCACCAACTT-3′. For FBI-1 expression in human adipose tissue samples, the following primers and probes were used: forward primer, 5′-AAGCCCTACGAGTGCAACATCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTTCCGCATGTGCACCTT-3′; probe, 5′-CAAGGTCCGCTTCACCAGGCAGG-3′. Oil Red O Staining—Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) for 5 min. After washing twice with PBS and once with 60% isopropanol, cells were incubated in oil red O (60% stock solution (0.5 g of oil red O (Sigma O-0625), 200 ml of isopropanol) and 40% water, filtered before use) at room temperature. Finally cells were washed once with 60% isopropanol and twice with PBS. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was tested using the Mann-Whitney test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis—Human subcutaneous preadipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion and differentiated in vitro for 2 days using the standard hormonal induction medium with (treatment group) and without (control group) the receptor PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. At 48 h, RNA was extracted and subjected to expression profiling using U95A Affymetrix microarrays (12,627 genes). The microarray experiment was primarily designed to compare gene expression of differentiating human preadipocytes in the presence versus absence of a PPARγ agonist. However, as rosiglitazone-treated human preadipocytes differentiate much more rapidly and completely than cells exposed only to a conventional differentiation mixture, any differences seen between the two treatments could reflect either a specific effect of the PPARγ agonist or a general effect of this agent on extent and pace of the differentiating process. Only 1.1% of the genes present on the chip showed significantly different expression levels between the treatment and control conditions (Fig. 1A). A list of all the genes detected to be increased or decreased more than 2-fold in the presence of rosiglitazone is shown in Tables I and II, respectively. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed on a selection of the identified genes (Fig. 1B), and in all cases the microarray results were confirmed.Table IOligonucleotide microarray results: up-regulated genes-Fold changeGenBank™ accession numberGenePutative function18.2AA128249FABP-4Fatty acid transport5.0AF000561FBI-1/TTF-1-interacting peptide 21Transcriptional repressor4.4AB005293PerilipinLipolysis4.1J03242Insulin-like growth factor IICell growth3.7M94856FABP (epidermal)Fatty acid transport3.4W28170cDNA clone3.3U5477814-3-3 ϵScaffolding protein3.0X56681Jun DTranscription factor3.0Z54367PlectinCytoskeletal protein3.0AF032108Integrin α72.9U44385Metalloproteinase inhibitor 2Extracellular matrix2.8L25879p53/HEH epoxide hydrolase2.6L26232Phospholipid transfer proteinLipoprotein metabolism2.4AC006128Chromosome 19, cosmid F 209002.3X64364M6 antigenCell surface glycoprotein2.2U79287cDNA clone2.1L35240EnigmaEndocytosis Open table in a new tab Table IIOligonucleotide microarray results: down-regulated genes-Fold changeGenBank™ accession numberGenePutative function—2.5X05608Neurofilament subunit NF-L—2.3U31384G-protein γ11 subunitSignaling—2.3M97935ISGF-3Transcription factor—2.2D31886cDNA clone—2.1Z48579Disintegrin metalloproteinaseMetalloproteinase—2.1A08695Rap2Signaling Open table in a new tab The largest effect (18.2-fold) was found for FABP-4, the human homologue of mouse aP2. This gene has been previously reported to be a target for PPARγ and be up-regulated during differentiation (17Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). In addition to FABP-4, several other genes known to play a role in triglyceride synthesis and lipid transport were found to be increased in preadipocytes differentiated with rosiglitazone. These include glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (18Hajra A.K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hemati N. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Another group of up-regulated genes were reported to be involved in regulation of cell proliferation (insulin-like growth factor II (21Kalli K.R. Falowo O.I. Bale L.K. Zschunke M.A. Roche P.C. Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3259-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) and differentiation processes (M6 antigen (22Kasinrerk W. Fiebiger E. Stefanova I. Baumruker T. Knapp W.

Dermatol. 1992; 99: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)). FBI-1 (AF097916) was identified as a transcript second only to FABP-4 in its -fold difference between the groups. FBI-1 is a cellular POZ zinc finger domain protein able to bind to the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 promoter (3Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 4Morrison D.J. Pendergrast P.S. Stavropoulos P. Colmenares S.U. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N.

Grummet, personal communication. Expression Analysis of FBI-1—Human preadipocytes were isolated and grown to confluence under cell culture conditions before inducing them to differentiate by adding hormonal induction medium. RNA was then extracted at different time points during the differentiation process, and FBI-1 expression was measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). During this time course, FBI-1 was found to be regulated in a biphasic manner with an increase in the first 48 h of differentiation followed by a decline in later stages of adipogenesis. To ensure that the expression of FBI-1 in cultured preadipocytes was not simply an artifact of cell culture we examined the expression of this gene in human adipose tissue biopsies. Although FBI-1 has been shown to exhibit widespread expression (8Lee D.K. Suh D. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) no studies of adipose tissue have been reported so far. Human adipose tissue biopsies were collagenase-digested and separated into stromovascular and adipocyte fractions before measuring FBI-1 mRNA using real time RT-PCR (Taqman) analysis. FBI-1 mRNA was detectable in both fractions but was approximately 4-fold more abundant in the stromovascular fraction (Fig. 2B). Additionally we compared FBI-1 mRNA levels between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and found it to be expressed at similar levels in these two depots. Finally adipose tissue from morbidly obese subjects expressed higher levels of FBI-1 than that from normal weight subjects (Fig. 2C). We wished to establish whether the murine adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 might be a suitable model for the further study of the putative role of FBI-1 in adipogenesis. Expression of the mouse homologue of FBI-1 (LRF) in these cells was measured during differentiation (Fig. 3, A and B). These experiments revealed that the expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation follows a pattern very similar to human cells with an increase in early adipogenesis and a second decline in later stages of the differentiation process. Marked FBI-1 induction was found only when 3T3-L1 cells were treated with the full differentiation mixture, whereas treatment with the single components alone increased expression only marginally (Fig. 3C). These findings suggest that FBI-1 induction is related to the differentiation process itself rather than this protein being a specific target of one of the components of the differentiation mixture. Although FBI-1 was induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, in contrast to human preadipocytes its expression was not enhanced by the addition of rosiglitazone to these cells (Fig. 3D). FBI-1 Facilitates 3T3-L1 Adipogenesis—To investigate whether FBI-1 is an active participant in the preadipocyte differentiation process, a 3T3-L1 cell line stably overexpressing the cDNA of human FBI-1 was generated using a retroviral vector system. FBI-1 overexpression was confirmed in preconfluent cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). Levels of overexpression in the FBI-1 cell line were within the physiological range of FBI-1 up-regulation observed during differentiation of normal 3T3-L1 cells. We then induced control cells and FBI-1-overexpressing cells to differentiate by using the standard hormonal induction mixture. At 48-h intervals during differentiation, RNA was extracted, and expression of molecular markers of terminal differentiation was measured by Taqman real time RT-PCR. In the early stages of adipogenesis (day 2), PPARγ2 and aP2 mRNA expression was found to be significantly increased in FBI-1-overexpressing cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). We further examined expression of molecular markers of terminal differentiation at the protein level by Western blotting; higher levels of PPARγ2, aP2, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α were seen in cells overexpressing FBI-1 with maximal differences seen at day 4 (Fig. 4C). Finally FBI-1-overexpressing cells exhibited accelerated lipid accumulation as shown by oil red O staining with maximal difference between FBI-1-overexpressing and control cells being seen 6 days after induction of differentiation (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results suggest that FBI-1 is capable of facilitating terminal differentiation and therefore may act as an active participant in adipogenesis. Effect of FBI-1 on Mitotic Clonal Expansion—We next investigated possible mechanisms whereby FBI-1 might facilitate the early steps of preadipocyte differentiation. FBI-1 expression peaks at days 2–4 (Figs. 2A and 3, A and B) during adipogenesis. During the initial 4 days of differentiation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes undergo two cycles of synchronized cell division, a process known as mitotic clonal expansion. We therefore speculated that FBI-1 might be involved in regulation of this initial proliferation step. Control cells and FBI-1-overexpressing 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to confluence and induced to differentiate 2 days later. We then measured DNA synthesis within the first 26 h of differentiation by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Previous studies indicate that [3H]thymidine incorporation in this time frame shows a parabolic shaped curve with a peak at 20 h (24Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We first determined, using in vitro assays, that Cdc37 binds to the amino-terminal lobe of Cdk4. Subsequent mutagenesis revealed that Gly-15 (G15A) and Gly-18 (G18A) were critical for Cdc37-Cdk4 complex formation. Gly-15 and Gly-18 of Cdk4 are within the conserved Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif that is required for ATP binding to the kinase. Mutation of either glycine at the equivalent positions of Raf1 (G358A and G361A) also inhibited Cdc37 binding to Raf1. Replacing another conserved residue critical for ATP binding and kinase activity, Lys-35 (K35A), reduced Cdc37-Cdk4 complex formation but to a lesser extent. The interaction of Cdk4 with Cdc37 in vitro was not sensitive to changes in ATP levels. Cell-based assays indicated that Cdk4G15A and Cdk4G18A were present at the same level as wild type Cdk4. Equivalent amounts of p16 bound to Cdk4G15A and Cdk4G18A relative to wild type Cdk4, suggesting that Cdk4G15A and Cdk4G18A adopt significant tertiary structure. However, in contrast to wild type Cdk4, Cdk4G15A, and Cdk4G18A had greatly reduced binding of cyclin D1, Cdc37, and Hsp90. Importantly, overexpression of Cdc37 not only stimulated cyclin D1 binding to wild type Cdk4 but also restored its binding to Cdk4G15A. Under the same conditions, p16 binding to wild type Cdk4 was suppressed. Our findings show that the interaction of Cdc37 with its client protein kinases requires amino acid residues within a motif that is present in many protein kinases.

Molecular chaperones assist protein folding reactions in cells. They function by repeated binding and release cycles that facilitate the folding reaction and prevent polypeptide aggregation. Molecular chaperones of the Hsp90 class function in the folding and activation of clients involved in signal transduction, including many transcription factors and protein kinases. Hsp90 does not act alone in this capacity but in association with several different co-chaperones. Hsp90 also functions downstream of Hsp70, which interacts with many nascent polypeptide chains (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Co-chaperones are non-client chaperone-binding proteins that can also have chaperone activity. Among the many cochaperones that interact with Hsp90, Cdc37 is distinguished by having a preferential interaction with protein kinases. Cdc37 was originally identified as a gene required for cell cycle progression in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Ferguson J. Ho J.Y. Peterson T.A. Reed S.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6681-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).

The fact that Cdc37 usually acts in concert with Hsp90 leads to the hypothesis that Cdc37 is a kinase-targeting subunit of Hsp90 (24Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, it is far from clear whether all the protein kinases that interact with Cdc37 are Hsp90-dependent. Several lines of evidence indicate that Cdc37 itself has chaperone activity. Overexpression of Cdc37 can compensate for Hsp90 in terms of maintaining v-Src activity, although these two proteins are not completely interchangeable (25Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cdc37 regulates the ATPase activity of Hsp90 by suppressing ATP turnover, which is hypothesized to facilitate client loading onto Hsp90 (27Siligardi G. Panaretou B. Meyer P. Singh S. Woolfson D.N.

A truncated form of Cdc37 that no longer binds Hsp90 is still capable of partially rescuing the catalytic activity of a temperature-sensitive mutant of Hck and promoting its association with Hsp90 (28Scholz G. Hartson S.D. Cartledge K. Hall N. Shao J. Dunn A.R. Matts R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6984-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A similar Cdc37 mutant defective in Hsp90 binding maintains the ability to interact specifically with the reverse transcriptase of the duck hepatitis B virus both in vitro and in vivo (21Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Hu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24361-24367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A lingering question is how Cdc37 recognizes protein clients, given that they are diverse in sequence, structure, and function. One possibility is that there are specific sequences in client proteins that target interaction with Cdc37. In this paper, we address the question experimentally by dissecting the association of Cdc37 with Cdk4, a well characterized Cdc37 and Hsp90 client. Previous studies showed that Cdc37 interacts directly with Cdk4 and stabilizes the kinase (12Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 21Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Hu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24361-24367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The population of Cdk4 molecules that interact with Cdc37 are largely devoid of cyclin D1, suggesting that the chaperone complex functions to prepare Cdk4 for cyclin D1 interaction. Whether Cdc37 facilitates cyclin D1 binding independently of its role in Cdk4 folding is unclear. Increasing the levels of Cdc37 in insect cells stimulated the activity of Cdk4 without any apparent change in the amount of cyclin D1 binding to the kinase. On the other hand, studies performed with recombinant proteins showed that Cdc37 could stimulate cyclin D1 binding to Cdk4 (12Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 14Lamphere L. Fiore F. Xu X. Brizuela L. Keezer S. Sardet C. Draetta G.F. Gyuris J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present study, we define critical amino acids in Cdk4 that form part of the Cdc37-binding site and are important for subsequent interaction between Cdk4 and cyclin D1. Cell Culture and Transfection—HCT116 cells (ATCC CCL-247) were maintained in Invitrogen. RPMI 1640 medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acid solution, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). Cells were plated the day before transfection and transfected at 90–95% confluence using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and standard procedures. The total amount of DNA was kept at 24 μg for the transfection of a 10-cm dish: 24 μg (wild type or mutant) of FLAG-Cdk4 plasmid for Fig. 4A; 12 μg (wild type or mutant) of FLAG-Cdk4 plasmid and 12 μg of cyclin D1 plasmid for Fig. 4B;6 μg (wild type or mutant) of FLAG-Cdk4 plasmid, 6 μg of cyclin D1 plasmid; and 12 μg of Cdc37 plasmid (or the control plasmid) for Fig. 5.Fig. 5Overexpression of Cdc37 promotes cyclin D1 binding and inhibits p16 binding. Transfections were set up the same way as in Fig. 4, with the addition of either a control plasmid (-) or a plasmid expressing Cdc37. Cyclin D1 immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-cyclin D1 antibody and immobilized protein G-agarose. The amounts of proteins recovered from immunoprecipitation complex were quantitated using a densitometer after Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—For in vitro transcription and translation, the Kozak sequence and GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). open reading frame from pGEX-5 (Amersham Biosciences), followed by a spacer containing the NotI restriction site, were subcloned between HindIII and BamHI sites of pSP64 poly(A) vector (Promega). BamHI and NotI restriction sites were introduced at the 5′ and 3′ ends of full-length Cdk4 and all deletion constructs. PCR products were gel-purified, enzyme-digested, and inserted between BamHI and NotI sites of pSP64 poly(A) in-frame with GST. For in vivo expression, DNA oligonucleotides that encode the Kozak sequence and FLAG tag were inserted between the NheI and BamHI sites of pIRESneo2 (Invitrogen), followed by Cdk4 sequence as a BamHI-NotI fragment. The open reading frame of cyclin D1 was cloned into the NheI-NotI sites of pIRESneo2. The construction of the Cdc37 expression plasmid was described previously (22Rao J. Lee P. Benzeno S. Cardozo C. Albertus J. Robins D.M. Caplan A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5814-5820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification, in Vitro Transcription/Translation, Binding Experiment, and Kinase Assay—CDC37 was directly cloned by PCR from a human placenta cDNA library (Invitrogen). Subcloning, expression, and purification of His6-Cdc37 were described previously (22Rao J. Lee P. Benzeno S. Cardozo C. Albertus J. Robins D.M. Caplan A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5814-5820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription/translation, 1 μg of DNA template was added to 40 μl of TnT Quick Master Mix (Promega), supplemented with 20 μm methionine, and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Once the reaction was complete, the mixture was left on ice for 5 min before protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) and 1 μg of His6-Cdc37 were added. Proteins were allowed to bind at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was washed three times using wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) and resuspended as 50% slurry. 5 μl of protein mixture was diluted into 100 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) as total protein, and 40 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were added. The binding reaction was incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were pelleted, washed three times with wash buffer, and resuspended in 100 μl of 1× sample buffer. All samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The experiment shown in Fig. 3E was performed differently. GST-Cdk4 was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) first. After three washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the Sepharose was split into equal amounts. ATP or ATPγS was added to the Sepharosebound GST-Cdk4 at the indicated concentration, followed by the addition of His6-Cdc37. The binding reaction was incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h, after which the amount of His6-Cdc37 was measured by Western blot. The kinase activity of Raf1 was measured using the Raf1 kinase cascade assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (with ATP concentration at 250 μm). Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were prepared from 10-cm dishes 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, supernatant was transferred to a pre-chilled Eppendorf tube containing 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma), which was washed previously with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C with gentle agitation, the resin was pelleted and washed three times using wash buffer. For immunoprecipitation, 80 μl of 1× sample buffer was added, and the sample was heated at 95 °C. Western Blot—GST, Cdk4, and phospho-MEK-1 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Cdc37 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Hsp70, Hsp90, cyclin D1, and p16 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Cdc37 Binds to the Amino-terminal Lobe of Cdk4 —Several groups have reported interaction between Cdk4 and Cdc37 both in vitro and in vivo (12Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 13Dai K. Kobayashi R. Beach D. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We developed an in vitro binding assay based on this relatively tight association to define the minimal sequence that Cdc37 recognizes. GST-Cdk4, produced by reticulocyte lysate-based coupled transcription/translation, was able to bind His6-Cdc37 purified from bacteria. Under these conditions, GST-Cdk4 did not bind a control His6-tagged protein (47-2, a gift from Dr. Kiran Khandke) nor did GST associate with His6-Cdc37, indicating this interaction was specific (data not shown). We then generated a series of deletions extending inward from the carboxyl terminus of Cdk4 (Fig. 1A), and we examined the ability of these polypeptides to associate with Cdc37 in the binding assay. Two of them exhibited even higher affinity to Cdc37 than the full-length protein (lanes 7 and 8, Fig. 1B). CDKs are structurally similar to one another, consisting of an NH2-terminal lobe and COOH-terminal lobe, with the ATP-binding pocket and catalytic site located between the two lobes (29Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). The shorter one of the two Cdk4 polypeptides that bind tighter to Cdc37, consisting of amino acids 1–103, turned out to be the NH2-terminal lobe of Cdk4 (Cdk4-N). Mort-Bontemps-Soret et al. (30Mort-Bontemps-Soret M. Facca C. Faye G. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) made a similar observation that yeast Cdc37 associates strongly with the NH2-terminal lobe of Cdc28 but not with full-length Cdc28, in a two-hybrid assay. The conservation of this interaction, despite the fact that yeast and human Cdc37 proteins share only ∼20% sequence identity, suggests that the association of the NH2-terminal lobe with Cdc37 is of fundamental importance. We therefore examined this association in greater detail. Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly Motif Is Required for Cdc37-Kinase Interaction—The amino termini of CDKs consist primarily of β-sheets, with the PI(L)STIRE helix located between β3 and β4 (Fig. 2A) (31De Bondt H.L.

We found that upon deleting from the COOH-terminal end of Cdk4-N, polypeptides lacking β5 and β4 maintained most of the binding capacity, but further removal of the loop between β4 and the PLSTIRE helix caused complete loss of interaction (Fig. 2B). Reducing the length of the loop sequence by two amino acids at a time revealed that His-68 and Pro-69 were critical for binding to Cdc37 (Fig. 2C). However, substitution of His-68 and Pro-69 by alanine either individually or together did not reduce the interaction (data not shown). Examination of deletions extending in from the NH2 terminus of Cdk4-N revealed that removal of the first 15 amino acids greatly reduced the association of Cdk4-N with Cdc37 (Fig. 2D). However, deletion of up to 10 amino acids from the NH2 terminus caused no effect, indicating that amino acids 11–15 are involved in Cdc37 binding (Fig. 2E). This region partially overlaps with the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif found in many protein kinases and nucleotide-binding proteins, which helps to anchor the non-transferable phosphates of ATP (37Sternberg M.J. Taylor W.R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 38Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To explore the role of the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif for the in vitro Cdk4-Cdc37 interaction, the three conserved glycine residues were individually mutated. While changing the first glycine to alanine had no effect, replacing the second or the third glycine almost abolished binding of Cdk4-N to Cdc37 (Fig. 3A). Significantly, when the same mutations were introduced into full-length Cdk4, similar results were observed for the in vitro binding reaction (Fig. 3B). The Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif, however, is not sufficient for interaction with Cdc37. A 30-amino acid peptide containing the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif and adjacent sequence failed to bind Cdc37 (data not shown). In an effort to determine the generality of the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif requirement, these equivalent mutations were introduced into Raf1, which is another Cdc37 client protein kinase. As observed with Cdk4, replacing the second or third glycine with alanine also prevented the association of Raf1 with Cdc37 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, involvement of the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif in binding to Cdc37 is not unique to Cdk4. The Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif is believed to participate in anchoring the non-transferable phosphates of ATP (37Sternberg M.J. Taylor W.R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 38Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We determined the effect of individually mutating these glycines on the kinase activity of Raf1. Changing the first glycine to alanine slightly reduced the kinase activity of Raf1, as measured by MEK-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). By contrast, mutating either the second or third glycine to alanine almost completely abolished the kinase activity of Raf1. This reduced kinase activity could be due to reduced binding of Raf1 to ATP, to Cdc37, or to both. The crystal structure of cyclin A-bound Cdk2 indicates that the hydrophobic base of ATP fits into the cleft between the two lobes, and three conserved residues, Lys-33, Glu-51, and Asp-145, are involved in ATP phosphate orientation and Mg2+ coordination (32Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Mutation in these conserved residues affects the catalytic activity of many kinases (39Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar). Substituting the highly conserved lysine with alanine in full-length Cdk4 reduced the amount of kinase bound to Cdc37 compared with wild type Cdk4, but to a level higher than the Cdk4G15A or Cdk4G18A mutants (Fig. 3D). Thus, altering either of two functional domains important for ATP binding reduces the association of Cdk4 with Cdc37. One possibility is that ATP binding is involved in Cdk4-Cdc37 interaction, where Cdc37 might interact with the kinase-ATP complex. To examine this possibility, 5 mm ATP or ATPγS was added to the binding reaction, but neither of them enhanced or decreased the interaction of wild type Cdk4 or Cdk4G15A with Cdc37 (Fig. 3E). Cdc37 Promotes Cyclin D1 Binding and Inhibits p16 Binding—The role of Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif in the Cdc37-Cdk4 interaction was further studied in cells. Wild type and mutant forms of full-length Cdk4 were transiently expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins and immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-FLAG M2-agarose. Both Cdc37 and Hsp90 were detected in immunoprecipitates of wild type Cdk4 and Cdk4G13A. By contrast, binding of both Cdc37 and Hsp90 to Cdk4G15A and Cdk4G18A was substantially reduced (Fig. 4A), consistent with the in vitro data. We also co-expressed cyclin D1 with Cdk4 in order to monitor cyclin D1 interaction with Cdk4. Interestingly, when cyclin D1 was co-expressed with Cdk4, the G15A and G18A mutations greatly reduced the amount of cyclin D1 associated with Cdk4 (Fig. 4B). Not all protein interactions, such as Hsp70 and p16, with Cdk4 are affected by mutations in the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif. The binding of Hsp70, an early and critical step in proper folding of newly synthesized protein, is not affected (24Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding of the CDK inhibitor p16 to Cdk4 was not reduced by the G15A or G18A mutation (Fig. 4B). These findings lead to two conclusions: one, that Cdk4G15A and Cdk4G18A adopt a tertiary structure; and two, that the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif is required specifically for interaction of Cdk4 with Cdc37 but not with p16. Although overexpression of Cdc37 did not change the level of Cdk4 and cyclin D1, it did lead to an increase in the amount of cyclin D1 associated with wild type Cdk4 and, more importantly, restored cyclin D1 binding to Cdk4G15A (Fig. 5). By contrast, overexpression of Cdc37 inhibited p16 binding to Cdk4 by more than 50%. These changes were not due to enhanced Hsp90 binding, since the immunoprecipitation complex contained approximately the same amount of Hsp90, with or without Cdc37 overexpression. Immunoprecipitation of cyclin D1 revealed similar results, where the amount of Cdc37 recovered in the cyclin D1 complex correlates well with that of FLAG-Cdk4 (Fig. 5). The presence of Cdc37 in the cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates is dependent on Cdk4 because it requires co-overexpression of FLAG-Cdk4 (data not shown) and because mutation of Gly-15 to alanine in FLAG-Cdk4 reduces the amount of Cdc37 in the cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5). Therefore, a stable ternary complex can be formed where cyclin D1 binds to Cdk4, which in turn is bound to Cdc37. The data shown above demonstrate the importance of Gly-15 and Gly-18 residues within the amino-terminal lobe of Cdk4 for Cdc37 binding. These glycines are located between the β1- and β2-sheets that form part of the p16-binding site on Cdk6 (36Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J.O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). However, neither glycine is predicted to interact directly with p16 based on the Cdk6 crystal structure. Our identification of Gly-15 and Gly-18 as being important for Cdc37 binding is consistent with previous observations that Cdc37 and p16 bind competitively with each other (14Lamphere L. Fiore F. Xu X. Brizuela L. Keezer S. Sardet C. Draetta G.F. Gyuris J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), indicating that the sites of interaction of Cdc37 and p16 on Cdk4 are adjacent or overlapping. The Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif is found in many protein kinases and nucleotide-binding proteins and helps to anchor the non-transferable phosphates of ATP (37Sternberg M.J. Taylor W.R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 38Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We envision three possible models for the interaction of Cdc37 with Cdk4. One model is that Cdc37 recognizes the ATP-Cdk4 complex and that a decrease in ATP binding to Cdk4G15A or Cdk4G18A accounts for the observed reduction in Cdc37 binding. Against this possibility is the finding that the same amount of Cdk4 (either wild type or G15A mutant) is bound to Cdc37 regardless of whether no ATP or 5 mm ATP (or 5 mm ATPγS) is included in the binding assay. A second model is that the reduced interaction of Cdc37 with Cdk4G15A or Cdk4G18A is indirect and due to the reduced kinase activity of these altered Cdks. In this model, Cdk4 may phosphorylate itself or some other unknown factor(s), and this phosphorylation is required for the interaction of Cdc37 with Cdk4. Against this model is that alterations in the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif reduce the kinase activity of Cdk4 significantly more than mutation of the conserved lysine residue of Cdk4 that should completely eliminate the kinase activity of Cdk4. A third model, which fits all the data and which we favor, is that Cdc37 binds tightly to Cdk4 and contacts residues within the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif. Here the interaction of Cdc37 with Cdk4 does not require bound ATP and is not inhibited by ATP because Cdc37 binds more strongly than ATP to Cdk4 (the apparent KmATP for Cdk4 is estimated to be 10 μm (40Konstantinidis A.K. Radhakrishnan R. Gu F. Rao R.N. Yeh W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26506-26515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). Finally, despite the involvement of Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly sequence in Cdk4-Cdc37 interaction, the motif itself is not sufficient to bind Cdc37. It helps explain the fact that, although Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif is conserved in almost all protein kinases, Cdc37 is known to bind only a subset of them. Most important, while the binding of p16 to Cdk4G15A and Cdk4G18A mutants was unimpaired, Cdc37 binding was almost abolished, and cyclin D1 binding was greatly reduced. These findings suggest that Cdc37 assists in the formation of complexes between Cdk4 and cyclin D1 but not between Cdk4 and p16. It would place Cdc37 function in a more regulatory role rather than as a chaperone that functions in general protein kinase folding. On the other hand, there is fairly strong evidence to support the hypothesis that Cdc37 functions to promote protein folding and that its absence renders polypeptide clients susceptible to degradation. This notion has been demonstrated with Cdc28 in yeast (41Farrell A. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and with Cdk4 in terminally differentiating liver cells (42Wang H. Goode T. Iakova P. Albrecht J.H. Timchenko N.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 930-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In our studies, however, we note that Cdk4 mutants that fail to interact with Cdc37 had similar steady state levels compared with the wild type Cdk4 protein, suggesting no great change in polypeptide stability. Previous studies (14Lamphere L. Fiore F. Xu X. Brizuela L. Keezer S. Sardet C. Draetta G.F. Gyuris J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have already demonstrated the competitive nature of p16 and Cdc37 binding to Cdk4, an observation that is consistent with the tumor suppressor function of the former and the oncogenic character of the latter. Overexpression of Cdc37 not only led to an increase in the amount of cyclin D1 associated with wild type Cdk4 but also restored cyclin D1 binding to Cdk4G15A. At the same time, p16 interaction with wild type Cdk4 was suppressed, consistent with previous findings. The amount of Cdc37 recovered from cyclin D1 immunoprecipitation complex correlates well with that of Cdk4. Overall, the identification of the binding site for Cdc37 on Cdk4 should facilitate development of drug-based therapies that would be effective under conditions where mutant forms of p16 are incapable of inhibiting cell cycle progression."

The crystal structure of the heterohexameric trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase (CaaD) from Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170 inactivated by 3-bromopropiolate shows that Glu-52 in the α-subunit is positioned to function as the water-activating base for the addition of a hydroxyl group to C-3 of 3-chloroacrylate and 3-bromopropiolate, whereas the nearby Pro-1 in the β-subunit is positioned to provide a proton to C-2. Two arginine residues, αArg-8 and αArg-11, interact with the C-1 carboxylate groups, thereby polarizing the α,β-unsaturated acids. The reaction with 3-chloroacrylate results in the production of an unstable halohydrin, 3-chloro-3-hydroxypropanoate, which decomposes into the products malonate semialdehyde and HCl. In the inactivation mechanism, however, malonyl bromide is produced, which irreversibly alkylates the βPro-1. CaaD is related to 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, with which it shares an N-terminal proline. However, in 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, Pro-1 functions as a base participating in proton transfer within a hydrophobic active site, whereas in CaaD, the acidic proline is stabilized in a hydrophilic active site. The altered active site environment of CaaD thus facilitates a previously unknown reaction in the tautomerase superfamily, the hydration of the α,β-unsaturated bonds of trans-3-chloroacrylate and 3-bromopropiolate. The mechanism for these hydration reactions represents a novel catalytic strategy that results in carbon-halogen bond cleavage.

The mechanism for these hydration reactions represents a novel catalytic strategy that results in carbon-halogen bond cleavage. Dehalogenases are enzymes that cleave carbon-halogen bonds. They are found in various bacteria, allowing them to use halogenated hydrocarbons as growth substrates (1Janssen D.B. Oppentocht J.E. Poelarends G.J. Curr. Opin.

Detailed three-dimensional structural information is available for dehalogenases such as haloalkane dehalogenase, 2-haloacid dehalogenase, and haloalcohol dehalogenase, which catalyze the cofactor-independent cleavage of the covalent bond between a halogen and an sp3-hybridized carbon atom by substitution mechanisms (3Verschueren K.H.

In addition, several cofactor-dependent dehalogenases have been characterized that cleave the bond between a halogen and an sp2-hybridized carbon atom. Examples include heme-dependent reductive dehalogenases (6Neumann A. Siebert A. Trescher T. Reinhardt S. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. Arch.

In contrast, cofactor-independent dehalogenases that cleave the bond between a halogen and an sp2-hybridized carbon atom have only recently been discovered (9van Hylckama Vlieg J.E.T. Janssen D.B.

They are part of a multienzyme degradation route for the cis- and trans-isomers of 1,3-dichloropropene (DCP). 1The abbreviations used are: DCP, 1,3-dichloropropene; 4-OT, 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase; CaaD, trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: DCP, 1,3-dichloropropene; 4-OT, 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase; CaaD, trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Cis- and trans-DCP are components of the commercially produced fumigants Shell D-D and Telone II, which are used in agriculture to control plant-parasitic nematodes (10Poelarends G.J. Wilkens M. Larkin M.J. van Elsas J.D. Janssen D.B. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2931-2936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first step in the degradation of both DCP isomers is the hydrolytic cleavage of the bond between the chlorine and the sp3-hybridized carbon atom by a haloalkane dehalogenase (Fig. 1). Oxidation of the two products yields the cis- and trans-isomers of 3-chloroacrylic acid, which are subsequently dehalogenated by either the cis- or the trans-specific 3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase, yielding malonate semialdehyde and HCl. After enzymatic decarboxylation of malonate semialdehyde by malonate semialdehyde decarboxylase (12Poelarends G.J. Johnson Jr., W.H. Murzin A.G. Whitman C.P. J. Biol.

Like other structurally related members of the tautomerase superfamily (16Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Almrud J.J. Kern A.D.

Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although both the α and β chain of CaaD have an N-terminal proline, only βPro-1 is essential for catalysis (11Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, analogous to the oligomeric structure of 4-OT (15Subramanya H.S. Roper D.I. Dauter Z. Dodson E.J. Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Wigley D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), CaaD was postulated to be a trimer of αβ-dimers having three functional active sites, with βPro-1 functioning as a water-activating catalytic base (11Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Here, we present the crystal structure of CaaD inactivated by 3-bromopropiolate at 2.3-Å resolution. The structure suggests that a glutamate, together with the N-terminal proline, catalyzes the addition of water to the α,β-unsaturated bonds of 3-bromopropiolate and trans-3-chloroacrylate via a Michael addition. Hydration of trans-3-chloroacrylate results in the formation of an unstable halohydrin intermediate, decomposition of which is accompanied by carbon-halogen bond cleavage. Dehalogenation by hydration represents a novel strategy for the cleavage of vinylic carbon-halogen bonds.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe CaaD mutants αR8A, αE52Q, and αE52D were constructed using the coding sequence for the dehalogenase in plasmid pET44T2 (11Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as the template. The αR8A mutant was generated by PCR using the primer 5′-CACGGCATATGCCGATGATCTCTTGCGACATGGCCTATGGGAGAACA-3′, in which the NdeI site is in bold and the mutated codon is underlined. This primer corresponds to the 5′ end of the wild-type coding sequence and was used in combination with primer R, 5′-TTGCCCAAGCAGAGGGATCCCCTAGCT-3′, in which the BamHI site is in bold. The αE52Q and αE52D mutants were generated by overlap extension PCR (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). Primer F, 5′-CACGGCATATGCCGATGATCTCTTGCGAC-3′, in which the NdeI site is in bold, and primer R were used as the external primers. For the αE52Q mutant, the internal PCR primers were oligonucleotides 5′-AGCGGGATCAACTTCGTTCAGCACGGCGAGCAT-3′, in which the mutated codon is in bold, and 5′-AACGAAGTTGATCCCGCT-3′ (primer A). For the αE52D mutant, the internal PCR primers were oligonucleotide 5′-AGCGGGATCAACTTCGTTGACCACGGCGAGCAT-3′, in which the mutated codon is in bold, and primer A. The PCR reactions were carried out as described before (11Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the products were purified and cloned into plasmid pET3a (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for overexpression of the mutant genes. The mutant genes were sequenced to verify that only the intended changes had been introduced.Expression and purification of CaaD and its three mutants were done according to previously described procedures (11Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The purified mutant proteins were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and gel filtration chromatography as described before (25Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The activity assays with the purified enzymes were performed at 22 °C by following the decrease in absorbance at 224 nm, which corresponds to the hydration of trans-3-chloro- (ϵ = 4900 m-1 cm-1) and trans-3-bromoacrylate (ϵ = 9700 m-1 cm-1) (25Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), or by following the release of halide using a colorimetric assay (11Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Covalently inactivated CaaD was obtained after the addition of a 25-fold excess of 3-bromopropiolate to the protein solution, which was first diluted to 0.4 mg/ml to prevent overheating of the sample. The inhibitor was synthesized by a literature procedure (26Strauss F. Kollek L. Heyn W. Chem. Ber. 1930; 63: 1868-1899Crossref Google Scholar). Crystals of inactivated CaaD were obtained from 2 μl of hanging drops consisting of equal amounts of protein solution (8 mg/ml) and well solution containing 22% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 as precipitant, 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, 0.15 m ammonium acetate. Plates of dimensions 1 × 2 × 0.2 mm3 grew in a few days.A diffraction data set to 2.3-Å resolution was collected in-house on a MacScience image plate system using Cu-Kα radiation from a rotating anode generator. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALE-PACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The crystal diffracted to 2.3-Å resolution and had space group P21 with cell axes a = 55.4 Å, b = 100.6 Å, and c = 69.9 Å, and β = 98.9°, with two (αβ)3 hexamers in the asymmetric unit.Molecular replacement solutions were obtained with the program AMORE available in CCP4 (28Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). A search model was constructed from the atomic coordinates of hexameric 4-OT from P. putida CF600 (Protein Data Bank code 1OTF (15Subramanya H.S. Roper D.I. Dauter Z. Dodson E.J. Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Wigley D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar)) by selecting for each monomer only residues 1–45, which are most similar. All residues were changed to alanines except for the proline and glycine residues. Rotation and translation functions were calculated using data between 8- and 4-Å resolution. The molecular replacement yielded the position and orientation of both hexamers in the asymmetric unit. Refinement of the solutions by AMORE gave a correlation coefficient of 0.42 and an R-factor of 49.7%. The electron density maps at this stage were not interpretable, but some density was extending from some of the alanines of the search model. A σA-weighted map (30Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) calculated from the refined solutions from AMORE was used in a combined non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, density modification, and phase extension procedure using the prime-and-switch method available in the program RESOLVE (31Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1763-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This improved the overall figure of merit from 0.17 after calculation of the starting map to 0.48 in the final cycle of the density modification procedure. The resulting σA-weighted maps from RESOLVE showed improved electron density for the amino acid side chains and allowed identification of the α and β chains in the heterodimers of CaaD. Manual building of side chains and missing main chain atoms was subsequently alternated with simulated annealing and minimization runs in CNX (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). RESOLVE was used to obtain the most unbiased maps for model building, until σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc maps were of superior quality. The structure was built using QUANTA (Accelrys Inc.) and XtalView (32McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Coordinates for the adduct were based on malonate and minimized in QUANTA (Accelrys Inc.), and its parameters were generated using the Hic-Up server (33Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The quality of the final model of inactivated CaaD was analyzed with PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). A summary of the refinement statistics and geometric quality of the models is given in Table I.

Ultimately, one crystal of the inactivated enzyme was obtained that did not show these features. After molecular replacement, the structure was built from the 2.3-Å resolution electron density maps, resulting in a well defined model of the first 60 residues of the α and β chains of the enzyme. Fifteen C-terminal residues of the α chains and 10 C-terminal residues of the β chains, accounting for 17% of the total residues, remained undefined in the electron density maps. High flexibility of these residues could provide an explanation for the disorder in the crystals.Overall Structure of CaaD—The crystal structure of CaaD confirms that the enzyme is a trimer of αβ-heterodimers. The asymmetric unit contains two such hexamers, which superimpose with r.m.s.d. values between 0.3 and 0.4 Å for 6 × 55 Cα atoms of their core structure. The dimers are formed by the antiparallel interaction of a two-stranded parallel β-sheet of one chain with the equivalent β-sheet of the other chain, forming a four-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 2A). Two α-helices, one from each chain, lie antiparallel to each other at the concave side of the β-plane. Identical chains in the asymmetric unit superimpose with r.m.s.d. values between 0.20 and 0.35 Å for 55 Cα atoms, whereas the α and β chains superimpose with r.m.s.d. values between 1.3 and 1.5 Å. Three of these αβ-heterodimers, related by a non-crystallographic 3-fold rotation axis, form a barrel-like hexamer (Fig. 2B). Most dimer-dimer contacts in the hexamer are mediated by the edges of the β-sheets and are mainly of a hydrophobic nature. Each β-sheet further contributes negatively and positively charged amino acids that interact with each other in the central cavity in the hexamer (Fig. 2B). Additional dimer-dimer interactions are provided by a small β-hairpin structure at the C terminus of the α chains, extending the β-sheet of a neighboring dimer and partly covering the environment of the catalytic βPro-1. A similar β-hairpin structure is observed in the β chains, which contributes to the environment of the catalytically inactive Pro-1 of the α chain.Fig. 2Stereo views of (A) the dimeric and (B) the hexameric structure of CaaD. Dark-colored chains in each dimer represent the β chains, whereas the light-colored chains represent the α chains. The catalytically active N-terminal proline of the β chain is shown in Corey-Pauling-Koltun (CPK) representation. The figures were made using MOLSCRIPT and RASTER3D (43Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J.

They are located at the interface between two (αβ) dimers on one side of the hexamer, each harboring the catalytically important N-terminal proline of the β chain (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal proline residues of the α chains are at the opposite side of the hexamer and are also related to each other by the (αβ)3 3-fold rotation. However, the environments of the αPro-1 and βPro-1 are different.The catalytically active βPro-1 is located in the interface between two (αβ) dimers with several charged residues in its vicinity (Fig. 3B). Among them are the side chains of αArg-8 and αArg-11 from the same αβ-dimer containing the catalytic βPro-1. A third charged residue near βPro-1 is αGlu-52 from the same α chain as αArg-8 and αArg-11. Its carboxylate group is fixed by the amino group of the amide side chain of βAsn-39. The residue in the α chain equivalent to the βAsn-39 (αPhe-39) also contributes to the environment of βPro-1 by forming part of the active site wall.Fig. 3Detailed overview of the structure of inactivated CaaD.

The residues near αPro-1 that are equivalent to αArg-8, αArg-11, and αGlu-52 are βAla-8, βLeu-11, and βIle-52. These differences between the α and β chain result in a completely different environment for αPro-1, which accounts for the observation that the N-terminal proline of the α-subunit is not able to support the dehalogenation reaction (11Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Insight into the catalyzed reaction was obtained from the analysis of the covalent adduct bound to βPro-1 of the irreversibly inactivated form of CaaD, which resulted from the covalent modification of the enzyme by 3-bromopropiolate. The design of this compound was based on the known ability of fumarase to hydrate acetylene dicarboxylate (35Marletta M.A. Cheung Y.-F. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2637-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The product, hydroxyfumarate, ketonizes to afford oxaloacetate. Likewise, hydration of 3-bromopropiolate produces an unstable enol, which rearranges to an acyl bromide (25Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The electron density map of the inactivated form of CaaD demonstrates the covalent modification of only βPro-1, and not αPro-1. The electron density also allowed us to unambiguously establish the structure of the covalent adduct (Fig. 3B). It was first noted that none of the active sites showed electron density for a bromide ion or a bromine atom on the inhibitor. This is consistent with the previous observation of bromide release from the inhibitor upon incubation with the enzyme (25Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Second, the first two atoms attached to the prolyl nitrogen resemble a carbonyl group of a peptide bond, being in one plane with the nitrogen and carbon Cα and Cδ atoms of the proline ring. From this peptide, additional electron density extends toward the side chains of αArg-8 and αArg-11, which is compatible with a carboxylate group of the adduct. The dihedral angle between the peptide plane and the plane of the carboxylate group is 67.1°, demonstrating that no unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds are present in the adduct. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the reaction of the enzyme with 3-bromopropiolate has resulted in the attachment of a malonyl group to the nitrogen atom of the N-terminal proline (Fig. 3, a and b). This result is in agreement with the previously reported mass increase of the β chain upon covalent modification (25Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The modification of the βPro-1 by a malonyl group may at first seem surprising but is readily explained by the addition of a water molecule to the carbon-carbon triple bond as a first step in the reaction of 3-bromopropiolate with the enzyme (see below).Apart from the interaction of its carboxylate group with αArg-8 and αArg-11, the adduct further has hydrophobic contacts with αPhe-50, αLeu-57, and βIle-37. Interestingly, one active site in each of the two different (αβ)3 hexamers in the asymmetric unit shows electron density for a water molecule between the αGlu-52 Oϵ2 atom and the nitrogen atom of the modified proline. Strikingly, the covalent adduct in this active site shows negative electron density at the position of its carboxylate group. Because β-ketoacids readily undergo decarboxylation (36Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. Dover Publications Inc., New York1987: 116-120Google Scholar), the binding of the wat"

It is, therefore, of pivotal importance to examine a family of proteins that serve as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which regulate the transcription of a variety of cytokines. We report here a defective gene (Stat5b) located on chromosome 11 within a previously mapped T1D susceptibility interval (Idd4) in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Our sequencing analysis revealed a unique mutation C1462A that results in a leucine to methionine (L327M) in Stat5b of NOD mice. Leu327, the first residue in the DNA binding domain of STAT proteins, is conserved in all identified mammalian STAT proteins. Homology modeling predicted that the mutant Stat5b has a weaker DNA binding, which was confirmed by DNA-protein binding assays. The inapt transcriptional regulation ability of the mutated Stat5b is proved by decreased levels of RNA of Stat5b-regulated genes (IL-2Rβ and Pim1). Consequently, IL-2Rβ and Pim1 proteins were shown by Western blotting to have lower levels in NOD compared with normal B6 mice. These proteins have been implicated in immune regulation, apoptosis, activation-induced cell death, and control of autoimmunity. Therefore, the Stat5b pathway is a key molecular defect in NOD mice.

Studies on the NOD mouse model that spontaneously develops T1D have shown that both B and T cells are necessary for the development of the disease (1Akashi T. Nagafuchi S. Anzai K. Kondo S.

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies on this animal model, the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to the development and progression of T1D still remain elusive. The involvement of cytokines that finely regulate immune and hematopoietic systems in the pathogenesis of diabetes has been an area of intense research.

Since the link between cytokines and T1D is indisputable, it becomes obligatory to examine the cytokine signaling pathways in relation to the disease. Studies of transcriptional activation by interferons and a variety of cytokines have led to the identification of a family of proteins that serve as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). There are seven identified members in this important family of proteins (Statl to Stat4, Stat5a, Stat5b, and Stat6). Upon activation by a large number of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones, STAT proteins are phosphorylated via the Janus kinases, dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to the promoters of specific target genes (10Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den A.F. Stark G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 106-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Leonard W.J. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). STAT proteins regulate the expression of a large number of cytokines and their receptors as well as other important molecules involved in immune regulation. In mice, the genes encoding Stat3, Stat5a, and Stat5b map to chromosome 11 (14Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Schindler C. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. Quelle F.W. Ihle J.N. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1995; 29: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) within a previously defined Idd4 interval (15McDuffie M. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 96: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All of the correlative pieces of information led us to explore a plausible connection between T1D and Stat genes on chromosome 11. This study attempted to use the positional candidate gene approach to test the hypothesis whether functionally chosen candidate genes in the proximity of previously mapped T1D susceptibility intervals are implicated in the disease. We report the identification of a mutation within the DNA binding domain of Stat5b in NOD, which results in diminished DNA binding affinity of Stat5b and reduced expression of downstream genes bearing the Stat5b consensus in their promoter regions. Ten-week-old female mice of six strains including C57B1/6J (B6) and NOD/LtJ (NOD), C3H, NZW, BALB/c, and CBA were obtained from our mouse colony at the University of Florida. Total RNA samples were prepared from spleen cells using standard methods. A subset of mice was induced with 0.5 μg (1 μg/ml) of GM-CSF in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin through intraperitoneal injection. After 20 min of induction, the animals were sacrificed, and tissues were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C. Sham-treated controls were injected with 500 μl of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in 0.2-μm filtered PBS (Invitrogen) and sacrificed after 20 min as above. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from spleens were prepared using the method described by Galsgaard et al. (16Galsgaard E.D. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Serup P. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, tissues were homogenized on ice in hypotonic buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ml/100 ml of phosphatase/inhibitor mixture I, complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet (2 tablets/100 ml). Homogenate was kept for 30 min on ice, and then nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants containing cytosolic protein were transferred to clean tubes and stored at -80 °C for further use. Nuclear protein was extracted from pellets by adding hypertonic buffer B (buffer A with 400 mm NaCl). Each tube was vigorously vortexed for 2 min and then sonicated for 3 s at 18 watts. After centrifugation, 50-μl aliquots of the supernatant (nuclear extract) were made and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The entire coding sequence of the Stat5b gene was amplified by PCR in two rounds. The first PCR amplification for Stat5b was carried out with two outside primers: Mstat5b-453F (CACGCGATTCGGGCTCTG) and Mstat5b-2900R (GAAGCGATTCATGGAATTAAAA). The amplified PCR products were then used as templates for nested PCR amplifications. Two overlapping fragments were amplified using two primer pairs: Mstat5b-472F (AGGTGGTGAACCATGGCTAT) and Mstat5b-1746R (CAGACCTCTTGATTCGTTTC) for the 5′ fragment and Mstat5b-1591F (AAGGCGACCATCATCAGC) and Mstat5b-2875R (AGGAAGTTCCTCCACGAG) for the 3′ fragment. The entire coding region of the Stat3 gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR in two rounds. In the first round of PCR amplification, 2 μl of cDNA was used as a template using primers Mstat3-9-F (5′-TGG ACA CAC GCT ACC TGA AG-3′) and Mstat3-1261-R (CAG GCT GCC GTT GTT AGA CT). The amplified PCR products were then used for the second round of PCR amplifications using the following primer pair: Mstat3-1020-F (AAG AGT GCC TTC GTG GTG GA) and Mstat3–25l0-R (GCC CAA AGA TAG CAG AAG TAG). The primers used for amplifying Stat5a in the first round are mStat5A-13F (5′-GTC AAG AGC CGT CAG GAG-3′) and mStat5A-2556R (GAA ACG TGC AAA GCC ATT GTT). The second round of PCR amplification was done with mStat5A-43F (CCG GCC TGG AGC GAC AAG) and mStat5A-1328R (TTT CTG AAG TGG GCG CTG A) and also mStat5A-1200F (GAA GGC GAC CAT CAT CAG C) and mStat5A-25l2R (GAC GTG GGC TCC TCA CAC TG). The nested PCR products were subjected to direct DNA sequencing using a PerkinElmer 377 automated DNA sequencer. Stat5b consensus sequence (5′-TTTCTAGGAATT-3′) was used for EMSAs, whereas the mutant oligonucleotide 5′-TTTAGTTTAATT-3′ was used as a competitor. Complementary oligonucleotides were used to make double strand DNA, which was end-labeled using 170 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated isotope was removed using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit. Labeled oligonucleotides with a count of ∼30,000 cpm were used for EMSA. An equal amount of nuclear protein extract (5 μg) was incubated with double strand oligonucleotides (consensus/mutant) at room temperature for 20 min in a binding buffer (13 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, 0.15 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) (17Storz P. Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and in the presence of poly(dI-dC) (2.5 μg/μl). For competition studies, 10-fold of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added in the preincubation step. For supershift assay, the protein extract was first incubated with 0.8 μg of antibody for 20 min at room temperature. Oligonucleotide was then added, and the reaction continued for another 30 min at room temperature. The anti-Stat3 (SC-482X), anti-Stat5a (SC-1081X), anti-Stat5b (SC-835X), and anti-Nmi (sc-9484X) antibodies are rabbit polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing gel containing 5% glycerol and 0.5× TBE. The gels were prerun in 0.5× TBE for 30 min at 150 V. 2 μl of loading mix (40% sucrose, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol) was added to each sample before loading. The gels were run at 250 mV for the first 15 min and then at constant 150 mV for about 4 h. The gels were exposed to x-ray films and then kept at -80 °C for at least 48 h. A new microbeads-based assay was developed with the Luminex system (Luminex Corp.) to study DNA-protein interaction. Briefly, oligonucleotides with a biotin group at the 5′-end were immobilized on Lumavidin 6 microspheres (20 nm/250,000 beads) using a standard conjugation protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The assays were conducted by employing 10,000 oligonucleotide-conjugated beads in a 100-μl reaction containing 13 mm HEPES, 80 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, 0.15 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9, and 5 μg of protein extracts (or peptide). The reaction was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The microspheres were pelleted down by centrifugation at 14000 × g for 2 min, washed, and reconstituted in 100 μl of fresh reaction buffer. The reaction was incubated for 1 h with anti-Stat5b antibody (4 μl/100-μl reaction). Once again, the microspheres were pelleted, washed, and resuspended as above. The bound Stat5b antibody was probed with Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and was detected on a Luminex 100 Flowmetrics system (excitation wavelength 532 nm). The signals originating from the Cy3-labeled secondary antibody reflect the amount of Stat5b protein captured by the oligonucleotides on the beads. We scored 5000 beads for each assay, and the mean fluorescence intensities were computed. The experiment was repeated three times, and the results were averaged. Two peptides were also used in the DNA protein binding assay. These peptides correspond to the DNA binding region (including the mutation L327M) of wild type Stat5b (DIISALVTSTFIIEKQPPQVLK) and mutant (NOD) Stat5b (DIISAMVTSTFIIEKQPPQVLK) and were purchased from New England Peptide, Inc. Cytosolic or nuclear proteins were diluted 1:4 with Laemmli sample buffer, and an equal amount of protein (10 μg) from each sample was loaded onto a running gel (pH 8.3) of various concentrations with a 4% stacking gel (pH 6.8). Gels were run on a MiniProtean III vertical electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 3 h. The separated proteins were processed for transfer onto Sequiblot polyvinylidene difluoride (0.2 μm; Bio-Rad). For this, the gels were assembled in a transfer module, and the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane prewet in methanol and equilibrated in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine (pH 8.2), 40% methanol (v/v)) using a Mini Transblot cell (Bio-Rad). The transfer was performed at 15-mA constant current for each membrane for 12–16 h. The blots were developed by the ECL method. For this, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were prewet in methanol, washed two times for 5 min into 1× phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween, followed by blocking (Super Block; Pierce) for 60 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The membranes were washed five times in PBS-T and incubated for 1 h with optimal concentrations of primary antibodies. After incubation, the membranes were extensively washed five times (5 min each) in PBS-T and then incubated for 60 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Visualization was performed using the ECL kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used in immunoblotting studies were as follows: anti-Stat5b (sc-835), Jak2 (sc-294), Erk-2 (sc-154), IL-2R-β (sc-672), Pim1 (sc-13513), Bag-1 (sc-940), Mcl-1 (sc-958), Bcl-2 (sc-492), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85α (sc-423) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), phosphorylated Stat5b antibody from Upstate Biotechnology (05-495), and Tyk-2 from BIOSOURCE (catalog no. 44-418). Spleen Smear Preparation—Experimental and sham-treated control subsets were prepared as detailed above. Spleen was excised, detached of adhering fat, washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), and ground between two frosted glass plates in 10 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer and collected in 15-ml sterile tubes. 1 ml of RBC lysis buffer (Sigma) was added, and the cells were shaken gently on a rocker for 1 min. The cells were transferred in a centrifuge tube and sedimented by gravity for 10 min. The supernatant was aspirated and centrifuged for 7 min at 2000 rpm. The pellet was reconstituted in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cell density was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml. 50 μl of cells were smeared on polylysine-coated slides. The spleen smear slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde by incubation for 30 min. They were air-dried in a hood and store at 4 °C in a slide box. Immunohistochemistry of Spleen Cells—Immunocytochemistry of spleen smears was done as previously described (18Saxena D. Purohit S.B. Kumer G.P. Laloraya M. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fixed spleen smears were washed with PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) (three washings, 10 min each), neutralized in 50 mm NH4Cl, and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 followed by blocking in 5% normal goat serum for 2 h. The smears were then incubated with primary antibody, viz. anti-Stat5b rabbit polyclonal (sc-835) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (1:200 dilution for 12–18 h). The smears were washed three times for 10 min each and subsequently treated with the relevant secondary antibody, viz. goat anti-rabbit IgG FITC (BG FITC-2) from Bangalore Genei, India (1:200 dilution) for 60 min. The smears were washed three times for 10 min each and processed for nuclear staining by incubating in a 1:1000 dilution of a 1 mg/ml solution of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride hydrate for 15 min. The fluorescence was observed using an excitation wavelength of 450–490 nm with a Nikon B-2A filter for FITC conjugates and a 355–375-nm excitation wavelength with a Nikon UV-1A filter for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The results were observed under a Nikon epifluorescence microscope, and the images were captured and documented by the COOL SNAP camera and the Documentation System from Alpha Innotech Corp. Northern blot was carried out as described previously (19Wilson K.H. Eckenrode S.E. Li Q.Z. Ruan Q.G. Yang P. Shi J.D. Davoodi-Semiromi A. McIndoe R.A. Croker B.P. She J.X. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2151-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, 15 μg of total RNA was loaded onto 1.5% agarose gel containing 20% formaldehyde. Electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V for 3 h, and then the gel was blotted to the BrightStar membrane (Ambion) in 20× SSC buffer for overnight. The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane using Crosslinker (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out at 42 °C using UltraHyb buffer (Ambion). 3 μg of total RNA was converted to the cDNA by reverse transcriptase and diluted 1:1 by TE buffer. 2 μl of diluted cDNA was used for PCR amplification of the Il-2Rβ and Pim1 genes. The primers for IL-2Rβ are a forward primer (5′-GGATGCCGGAAGGTGATG) and a reverse primer (5′-AGGCAGGTACAGGAAGCTA). The primers for PIM1 are a forward primer (5′-GTGAGCTCGGACTTCTCG) and a reverse primer (5′-GATGGTAGCGAATCCACTCT). The PCR products were loaded onto 2% agarose gel, and then the DNA was recovered from the gel using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR products were labeled with 32P with a random labeling kit (Stratagene), and unincorporated isotope was purified by a SigmaSpin postreaction purification column (Sigma). An initial search for templates for homology modeling of Stat5b was carried out using FASTA-CHECK. The search produced two closely similar templates: 1 BF5 (the crystal structure of Statl) and 1BGF (the N terminus of Stat4). A model for the Stat5b-DNA complex was generated by threading the murine Stat5b protein sequence into the crystal coordinates of these two model templates using LOOK II (Molecular Applications Group). The model was energy-minimized using the DISCOVER module of INSIGHT-II (Molecular Simulations Group). The fit was verified by WHAT-IF and PROCHECK 2.0. A mutation of L327M was introduced by the MUTATE function of SWISS-MODEL, and the model was once again energy-minimized. The local field energy around the amino acid at position 327 was mapped before and after the introduction of the mutation. Sequencing of Stat Genes on Chromosome 11—Three candidate genes within the Idd4 interval on chromosome 11 (Stat3, Stat5a, and Stat5b) were sequenced in NOD and C57BL/6 (B6). Three nucleotide positions in Stat3 and two in Stat5a of both B6 and NOD mice differ from the published sequences (Table I). Since there is no difference between NOD and B6, they are unlikely candidates for diabetes susceptibility factors. Three alterations in Stat5b at positions 433 (G→ A), 767 (G→ C) and 768 (C→ G) are considered as polymorphisms, since they are present in both B6 and NOD animals. Two of the three nucleotide changes are silent mutations. A point mutation (C1462A) in the NOD leads to a substitution of leucine to methionine at position 327 (L327M), the first amino acid of the DNA binding domain of the STAT proteins (Fig. 1, A and B). This mutation was not found in the five control strains (B6, C3H, NZW, BALB/c, and CBA). The Leu327 residue is conserved in all STAT proteins sequenced to date.Table IMutations found in the Stat3, Stat5a, and Stat5b genes Mutations are shown in boldface type.GeneCodonPublishedNODB6EffectStat316AAG/LysGAG/GluGAG/GluAmino acid change25ACG/ThrAGC/GluAGC/GluAmino acid change518CGA/ArgCGG/ArgCGG/ArgSilentStat5a190GGA/GlyGGC/GlyGGC/GlySilent527AAG/LysAAA/LysAAA/LysSilentStat5b327CTG/LeuATG/MetCTG/LeuChange in NOD433GGG/GlyGAG/GluGAG/GluAmino acid change767CGG/ArgCGC/ArgCGC/ArgSilent768GTC/ValGTG/ValGTG/ValSilent Open table in a new tab The potential impact of the L327M mutation on the DNA binding ability of Stat5b was assessed by homology modeling for the wild type and mutant Stat5b. As shown in Fig. 1C, leucine 327 (yellow residue) of the wild type Stat5b establishes contacts with the palindromic DNA binding sequence (TTCN3GAA) at the TT positions. The replacement of leucine with methionine (green residue in Fig. 1D) increases the side chain volume and the bulk hydrophobicity around the critical contact point. The local energy values drift from +185 kJ/mol to -33 kJ/mol when methionine replaces leucine. This change would abolish the side chain interdigitation between Leu327 and the thymidine. This introduces a spatial barrier between the Met327 side chain and the thymidine residue (Fig. 1D), which would reduce the ability of methionine to interact with the DNA sequence. Therefore, the mutant Stat5b is predicted to exhibit a weaker DNA binding affinity. DNA Binding Affinity of Stat5b—The DNA binding ability was compared between the wild type (B6) and mutant (NOD) Stat5b using an EMSA. Protein extracts from the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared from splenocytes with and without in vivo stimulation with GM-CSF. Western blot with anti-Stat5b antibody showed that the levels of cytosolic fraction, phosphorylated cytosolic fraction, and nuclear Stat5b are comparable in NOD and B6 (Fig. 2A). These results are complemented with immunocytochemical analysis showing similar cytosolic and nuclear Stat5b levels in spleen cells from B6 and NOD mice (Fig. 2B). Consistently, similar levels of proteins were found in NOD and B6 for the upstream mediators for the activation of Stat5b including the Jak2, tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erkl and Erk2) involved in phosphorylation of STATs (Fig. 2C). Nuclear extracts were used in EMSA with the consensus DNA sequence recognized by Stat5 proteins (20Gouilleux F. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Wakao H. Haldosen L.A. Norstedt G. Levy D. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Both B6 and NOD animals showed strong gel shift with the Stat5 consensus sequence in the samples stimulated with GM-CSF as compared with a negligible shift in the unstimulated preparations (Fig. 3A). A supershift assay using polyclonal anti-Stat5b antibody showed that the Stat5b-specific DNA-protein complexes are about 5-fold higher in B6 than NOD mice (Fig. 3A, lane 5 versus lane 9). It is important to note that NOD nuclear extracts bound the Stat consensus represented by the shift position in Fig. 3A, lane 8. The Stat5b-specific DNA binding is attributable only to the supershifted band. An explanation for the weaker supershifted band could simply be that the antibody does not recognize the NOD form of Stat5b with the same affinity as the B6 form. This does not appear to hold any validity, since in all Western blots the same antibody recognized Stat5b in cytosolic and nuclear extracts with the same affinity, and no differences in the quantities of Stat5b were detectable (Fig. 2A), thus indicating that antigen-antibody binding is not affected by the mutation. Our immunofluorescence data in spleen cells for Stat5b levels show similar quantities in the cytosol and in the nucleus in both B6 and NOD. Once again, this suggests that the antigen-antibody binding is more or less unaffected by the mutation. Additionally, our combined Western and immunofluorescence data suggest similar nuclear export of the protein in both of these models. The antibody sc-835 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) has been extensively used by others in analyzing Stat5b-specific supershifts (21Zhou Y.C. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Zhou Y.C. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2672-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The specificity of the gel shift assay was confirmed using competition with mutated DNA and cold consensus oligonucleotide. The addition of a 10-fold molar excess of cold consensus oligonucleotide caused a complete disruption of the Stat5-DNA complex in extracts from both B6 and NOD mice, signifying the specificity of the interaction (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 6). Further, the use of a hot mutant Stat5b consensus with base replacements at underlined positions 5′-TTAGTTTAA-3′ also showed the inability of the mutant oligonucleotide to bind to the Stat5b protein from B6 and NOD nuclear extracts (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 7), confirming the specificity of the binding. Supershift assays with antibodies against Stat5a and Stat3, which may be associated with Stat5b (23Al Shami A. Mahanna W. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1058-1063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), indicated that the Stat5b complexes do not contain Stat5a (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 4) or Stat3 (Fig. 3C, lanes 6 and 8). Together, these results indicate that the weaker Stat5b-specific supershifted complexes in NOD mice were attributable to the impaired DNA binding of the mutant protein. These data are consistent with previous observations that mutations within the DNA-binding region result in Stat proteins that are activated normally but have greatly reduced DNA binding (24Boucheron C.

N-Myc interactor (Nmi) is identified as a Stat-interacting partner using a yeast two-hybrid assay. It also enhances the association of CREB-binding protein/p300 coactivator proteins with Stat1 and Stat5 and, together with CREB-binding protein/p300, augments IL-2 and interferon γ-dependent transcription. Thus, Nmi potentiates STAT-dependent transcription and can also augment coactivator protein recruitment to at least some members of a group of sequence-specific transcription factors (28Zhu M. John S. Berg M. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In order to understand the nature of the nonsupershifted band, we checked whether it can be supershifted using Nmi. The lack of coexistence of Nmi in the protein-DNA complex is also evident from the inability of anti-Nmi to supershift the shifted complex (Fig. 3C, lanes 10 and 12). Thus, we excluded the presence of Stat5a, Stat3, and Nmi in the protein-DNA complex. Centrosomal P4.1-associated protein has recently been shown to specifically interact with Stat5a and Stat5b but not with Stat1 or Stat3 using yeast two-hybrid screen of HBL"

Protective activity was assessed in competition assays by monitoring several detectors, i.e. dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR-123) oxidation, α1-antiproteinase (α1-AP) inactivation, and glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GST-P1-1) inactivation. In addition, nitration of tyrosine was measured to assess protection of the sulfur-containing compounds against ONOOH. For protection against HOCl, the efficacy of the antioxidant was controlled by the ratio of the reaction rates of the antioxidant and the detector molecule with the oxidant. The rank order of the activity of the antioxidants (GSH > DHLA ≈ LA ≈ GSMe > GSSG) appeared to be independent of the detector used. However, the rank order of the antioxidants against ONOOH-induced damage is strongly dependent on the detector. LA was 40 times less active than GSH in the inhibition of ONOOH-induced DHR-123 oxidation, whereas LA was 20 times more active than GSH in preventing the inhibition of GST-P1-1 by ONOOH. This points to different molecular mechanisms of ONOOH damage to DHR-123 compared with ONOOH damage to GST-P1-1. LA is a poor antioxidant in protecting against the form of ONOOH damage involved in DHR-123 oxidation. In the form of ONOOH toxicity involved in GST-P1-1 inhibition, LA is the most potent sulfur-containing antioxidant in our series. It is proposed that an intermediate product in which both sulfur atoms of LA have reacted is involved in the reaction of ONOOH with LA.

ONOOH is known to mediate both one- and two-electron oxidation reactions, whereas HOCl predominantly gives two-electron oxidation (14Terentis A.C. Thomas S.R. Burr J.A. Liebler D.C. Stocker R. Circ.

Biophys. 2002; 397: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, preliminary studies in our laboratory indicated that LA is a very poor protector against ONOOH-mediated oxidation of dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR-123). This controversy might originate from differences in the procedures used to assess the antioxidant activity of LA. The activity of an antioxidant is usually determined by quantifying the ability of the antioxidant to prevent damage induced by a reactive species to a detector. Den Hartog et al. (7den Hartog G.J.M. Haenen G.R.M.M. Vegt E. van der Vijgh W.J.F. Bast A. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 709-713PubMed Google Scholar) emphasized that the efficacy of an antioxidant depends on the reaction rate of the oxidant with the detector molecule relative to the reaction rate of the oxidant with the antioxidant. This was illustrated by the difference in protective activity against the HOCl of several sulfur-containing antioxidants using different detectors (7den Hartog G.J.M. Haenen G.R.M.M. Vegt E. van der Vijgh W.J.F. Bast A. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 709-713PubMed Google Scholar). The slower the reaction of the detector with the oxidant, the higher was the apparent activity of a protector. The objective of the present study is to further examine the antioxidant activity of sulfur-containing compounds in the presence of different detectors (protein and non-protein) and different oxidants (ONOOH and HOCl) in order to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the efficacy of LA in several antioxidant assays. The results show that, with HOCl, the rate of the reaction of HOCl with the oxidant relative to that of the detector is essential. With ONOOH, the molecular mechanism of damage and protection is decisive for the efficacy of the antioxidant. Chemicals—Elastase, α1-antiproteinase (α1-AP), glutathione S-transferase P-1–1 (GST-P1-1), GSH, GSSG, GSMe, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) l-tyrosine, 3-nitro-l-tyrosine, 5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) were obtained from Sigma. DHR-123 and KO2 were obtained from Fluka Chemie GmbH (Buchs, Switzerland). LA and β-LA were obtained from Asta Medica AG (Frankfurt, Germany). Nitrogen monoxide was obtained from AGA (Hamburg, Germany). All other chemicals were of the highest grade of purity. Synthesis of Potassium Oxoperonitrate—Potassium oxoperonitrate was produced from the reaction of solid KO2 with NO gas as described by Koppenol et al. (16Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 296-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the NO gas was slowly led over the mixture of KO2 and quartz sand, which was constantly stirred and kept on ice. The mixture was poured into a cold potassium hydroxide solution. Manganese dioxide was used to remove the hydrogen peroxide that results from decomposition of the excess of potassium superoxide. A solution with ONOOH was obtained by filtering off the sand and manganese dioxide. The concentration of ONOOH was determined spectrophotometrically at 302 nm. Oxidation of DHR-123—The use of DHR-123 as a detector to monitor protection against ONOOH- and HOCl-induced oxidation was based on the procedure described by Kooy et al. (17Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In short, 100 μl of the desired concentration of the test compound was added to 0.9 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer at 37 °C. DHR-123 was added to give a final concentration of 5 μm. During vortexing, 10 μl of ONOOH or HOCl was added to give a final concentration of 0.6 or 5 μm, respectively. The fluorescent product, rhodamine-123, was measured by fluorescence detection with excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 536 nm, respectively. The effects are expressed as the concentration giving 50% inhibition of the oxidation of DHR-123 (IC50). Control experiments showed that the test compounds in a concentration of 500 μm did not affect the fluorescence. Elastase Assay—Elastase activity was used as a detector according to the procedure described by Haenen and Bast (6Haenen G.R.M.M. Bast A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 2244-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reagents were dissolved in potassium phosphate buffer (19 mm), pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl. Twenty micrograms of α1-AP was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with the test compounds in the desired concentration. During vortexing, 10 μl of ONOOH was added. The final concentration of ONOOH was 150 μm. After 5 min incubation, 5 μg of elastase was added. After 10 min of incubation, 50 μl of a 10 mm solution of N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-l-alanine p-nitrophenol ester in methanol was added. The increase in absorption at 410 nm was determined. Control experiments showed that the test compounds in a concentration of 100 μm did not affect the activity of control or ONOOH-inactivated α1-AP. Gluthathione-S-transferase P1-1 Assay—GST-P1-1 (5 μg/ml) was mixed with the test compound in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 min. During vortexing, ONOOH (10 μm, final concentration) was added. After 2 min of incubation, 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1 mm GSH were added. GST-P1-1 activity was monitored spectrophotometrically by recording the increase in absorbance at 340 nm (18Mannervik B. Guthenberg C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Nitrotyrosine Assay—Under vortexing, 10 μl of ONOOH solution (final concentration 150 μm) was added to a solution containing 100 μml-tyrosine in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and the test compound in the desired concentration. This mixture was incubated for 5 min. Measurement of 3-nitrotyrosine was carried out by using HPLC. The eluent was 50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7, with 5% acetonitrile (v/v). The column was a Hypersil BDS-C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm) (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA). The UV detector was set at 278 nm. LA and GSH Consumption by ONOOH and HOCl—One hundred microliters of the antioxidant (dissolved in 100 mm phosphate buffer) was added to 700 μl of 100 mm phosphate buffer at 37 °C, giving a final concentration of 100 μm. During vortexing, 100 μl of the desired concentration of ONOOH or HOCl was added. GSH was determined spectrophotometrically by the addition of 100 μl of 6 mm 5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm (19Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). LA was determined using HPLC and UV detection at 333 nm. A Hypersil BDS-C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm) (Supelco Inc.) was used. The mobile phase was 10 mm phosphate solution in water (pH 2.7) plus acetonitrile (65:35) (v/v). The samples were acidified before HPLC analysis (pH 2.6–2.9). Determination of β-LA was performed on the same HPLC system at 230 nm. The mobile phase was 0.15% acetic acid in water/acetonitrile (75:25) (v/v). Protection against HOCl was assessed in competition assays using the detector molecules DHR-123, α1-AP, and GST-P1-1 (Table I). Each of the sulfur-containing compounds tested had a prominent protective effect against HOCl except GSSG, which only had a moderate protective effect against HOCl with DHR-123 as a detector molecule.Table IThe protective activity of several sulfur-containing compounds against HOCl-induced damage assessed using different detectorsCompoundIC50 HOCl-DHR-123IC50 HOCl-α1-APaData taken from Haenen and Bast (6).IC50 HOCl-GST-P1-1bData taken from den Hartog et al.

Open table in a new tab The protective effect of these sulfur-containing compounds against ONOOH was also assessed in competition assays using the detector molecules DHR-123, α1-AP, GST-P1-1, and tyrosine (Table II). GSH efficiently protected these detector molecules against ONOOH; the IC50 of GSH was practically independent of the detector. GSSG could not protect any of the detector molecules used against ONOOH. Methylation of GSH (giving GSMe) abolished the ability to protect against oxidation of DHR-123 and nitration of tyrosine with ONOOH. GSMe still had a considerable protective activity against ONOOH when α1-AP was used as a detector and, to a lesser extent, when GST P1-1 was used as a detector. Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a dithiol, had a protective effect against ONOOH that was slightly lower than that of GSH when DHR-123 was used as detector. DHLA efficiently protected α1-AP or tyrosine against ONOOH-mediated inhibition. LA, a compound that contains an intramolecular disulfide, was hardly effective in the prevention of DHR-123 oxidation by ONOOH, but it potently protected against ONOOH-induced α1-AP damage and tyrosine nitration. Remarkably, both LA and DHLA had a very potent protective activity against ONOOH when GST-P1-1 was used as a detector. Their protective effect against ONOOH with this detector was ∼20 times more potent than that of GSH.Table IIThe protecting activity of several sulfur-containing compounds against ONOOH-mediated damage assessed with different detectorsCompoundIC50 ONOOH-DHR-123IC50 ONOOH-α1-APIC50 ONOOH-GST-P1-1IC50 ONOOH-tyrosineμmμmμmμmReduced glutathione26 ± 938 ± 1917 ± 120 ± 1S-Methylglutathione>100052 ± 6104 ± 3>200Glutathione disulfide>1000>500>200>200Lipoic acid924 ± 6617 ± 20.9 ± 0.124 ± 1Dihydrolipoic acid56 ± 917 ± 11.0 ± 0.123 ± 1 Open table in a new tab The difference in protective activity against ONOOH between GSH and LA prompted us to perform additional experiments. The consumption of GSH and LA by different concentrations of ONOOH was determined (Fig. 1). The stoichiometry of the initial reaction of GSH was ∼1, i.e. one molecule of GSH reacts with one molecule of ONOOH. The apparent stoichiometry of LA was >1. With a 5-fold excess of ONOOH over LA, less than half of the LA was consumed. The product formed was β-LA, the thiosulfinate of LA that has four possible isomers (4Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Haenen G.R.M.M. Bast A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 2244-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the initial reaction of GSH with HOCl was comparable with that of LA, i.e. one molecule of the antioxidant reacts with one molecule of the oxidant (Fig. 2). The product formed by the reaction of LA with HOCl was β-LA (Fig. 2). Some sulfur-containing compounds can form an effective line of defense against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The aim of the present study is to further examine the antioxidant activity of sulfur-containing compounds in order to explain the difference in activity observed in some assays. The present study demonstrated differences in the protective activity of sulfur-containing compounds against HOCl-mediated oxidation of different detectors. This can be explained by the rate of the reaction of the sulfur antioxidant with HOCl relative to the rate of the reaction of the detector with HOCl. The rank order of the antioxidants is independent of the detector used. The ostensible activity of a poor antioxidant can be upgraded by using a slowly reacting detector. This is shown nicely by the relatively high potency of GSSG, a compound that reacts sluggishly with HOCl (6Haenen G.R.M.M. Bast A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 2244-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to protect DHR-123 against HOCl-mediated oxidation (Table I), because DHR-123 reacts just as sluggishly with HOCl as GSSG does. GSSG does not protect faster reacting detectors, e.g. α1-AP and GST-P1-1, against HOCl damage. Similarly, Den Hartog et al. (7den Hartog G.J.M. Haenen G.R.M.M. Vegt E. van der Vijgh W.J.F. Bast A. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 709-713PubMed Google Scholar) reported that acetylcholinesterase is efficiently protected by GSSG against HOCl-induced damage. This can also be explained by the relatively slow reaction of the target, acetylcholinesterase, with HOCl. Also, other proclaimed antioxidant activities of GSSG, e.g. the ability of GSSG to protect against NO2Cl-induced DNA damage (20Chen H.J. Wu S.B. Chang C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), are probably the result of a relatively slow reacting detector (DNA). In vivo NO2Cl will probably react with other cellular targets besides DNA. In such a case, the reported antioxidant effect of GSSG is, of course, physiologically irrelevant. GSH protected all the tested detectors efficiently against ONOOH, whereas GSSG is not a protector against ONOOH (Table II). GSMe did not protect DHR-123 and tyrosine, whereas it did protect the targets GST-P1-1 and α1-AP against ONOOH-induced inhibition. One of the vulnerable groups in α1-AP is methionine. Oxidation of methionine in α1-AP results in a loss of activity (21Evans M.D. Pryor W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L593-L611PubMed Google Scholar). Because in methionine and GSMe a chemically identical group, i.e. the S-methyl group (21Evans M.D. Pryor W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L593-L611PubMed Google Scholar), is attacked by ONOOH, it was anticipated that α1-AP is protected by GSMe. The relatively high IC50 of GSMe with DHR-123 and tyrosine can be explained by arguing that the reaction rate of these detectors with ONOOH is higher than that of GSMe, whereas the lower IC50 of GSMe with α1-AP or GST-P1-1 indicates that the reaction rate of ONOOH with these detectors is comparable with the reaction rate of ONOOH with GSMe. This explanation is in line with the explanation described above for the difference in activity of an antioxidant toward HOCl in different assays. The efficacy of an antioxidant depends on the detector used. The most striking result is the finding that the antioxidants LA and DHLA protect GST-P1-1 far more efficiently against ONOOH than GSH (Table II). In contrast, LA provides a very poor protection against ONOOH-induced DHR-123 oxidation (Table II). GSSG was not able to protect the ONOOH-mediated oxidation of DHR-123, α1-AP, GST-P1-1, or tyrosine (Table II). Moreover, the rank order in potency of the antioxidants is not similar for the four detectors used (Table II). This implies that a difference in the protective activity of LA is not solely due to the difference in reactivity of the detectors. The low consumption of LA by ONOOH compared with GSH is peculiar (Fig. 1). At equimolar concentrations of LA and ONOOH (100 μm), the consumption of LA was only 13%. The relatively low consumption of LA by ONOOH was also noted previously. Trujillo and Radi (4Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported that only 25% of LA was consumed when 5 mm of LA was mixed with 5 mm ONOOH. This denotes that the protection of GST-P1-1 against ONOOH by LA, which is superior to the protection offered by GSH, is not due to direct scavenging of ONOOH by LA. Apparently, the mechanism of protection of GST-P1-1 against ONOOH by LA differs from the protection by GSH against ONOOH-mediated DHR-123 oxidation. Also, the difference in rank order of the potencies of LA and GSH obtained with the different detectors points to different mechanisms of damage and protection. Tyrosine residues play a critical role in GST inactivation by ONOOH (22Wong P.S. Eiserich J.P. Reddy S. Lopez C.L. Cross C.E. van der Vliet A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous studies (2Whiteman M. Tritschler H. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Nakagawa H. Sumiki E. Takusagawa M. Ikota N. Matsushima Y. Ozawa T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 2000; 48: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the results presented in Table II revealed that LA offered an efficient protection against ONOOH-induced tyrosine nitration. The IC50 value of LA is six times lower than the initial concentration of ONOOH with tyrosine as a detector (IC50 = 24 μm; initial concentration of ONOOH = 150 μm) and >10 times lower than that of GST-P1-1 (IC50 = 0.9 μm; initial concentration of ONOOH = 10 μm). A similar difference was reported in the study of Whiteman et al. (2Whiteman M. Tritschler H. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); the IC50 value of LA for the inhibition of tyrosine nitration was 10 times as low as the initial concentration of ONOOH. Theoretically, in a standard competition assay the minimal IC50 of the antioxidant is equal to half of the initial concentration of oxidant, i.e. when the antioxidant reacts much faster than the detector. The explanations of Whiteman et al. (2Whiteman M. Tritschler H. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) for the very low IC50 of LA compared with that of the initial concentration of ONOOH were, first, that one molecule of LA can scavenge several ONOOH molecules and, second, that LA can combine with reactive intermediates. The first explanation, viz. that LA scavenges several ONOOH molecules, does not seem probable. The oxidation products of LA that is formed by ONOOH is identical to that formed by HOCl (Figs. 1 and 2), i.e. β-LA. This two-electron oxidation product of LA is formed after a reaction of one LA with probably one ONOOH (4Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or one HOCl (23Biewenga G.P. de Jong J. Bast A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This makes it unlikely that LA reacts with several ONOOH molecules. The second explanation of Whiteman et al. (2Whiteman M. Tritschler H. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), i.e. that LA can combine with the reactive intermediates of ONOOH, seems more plausible. Whiteman et al. (2Whiteman M. Tritschler H. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) stated that these intermediate products of ONOOH could be (NO2·‖ and NO2+. Interestingly, Nakagawa et al. (3Nakagawa H. Sumiki E. Takusagawa M. Ikota N. Matsushima Y. Ozawa T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 2000; 48: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that LA is a selective inhibitor of tyrosine nitration by ONOOH, but LA does not inhibit ONOOH-induced dityrosine formation from tyrosine. They argued that ONOOH has two reactive forms, i.e. a caged biradical [ONO·… ·OH] and a caged bipolar [ONO+… –OH] form. The caged biradical form of ONOOH yields dityrosine, and the caged bipolar form of ONOOH yields nitrotyrosine. LA was suggested as protecting against the bipolar form only, whereas thiol-containing compounds such as GSH and DHLA protect against both the bipolar and the biradical form. Although this explanation is highly speculative, it fits nicely within our experimental data. The oxidation of DHR-123 could, just as the oxidation of tyrosine into dityrosine, be mediated by the biradical form of ONOOH and, therefore, be inhibited by sulfhydryl-containing compounds and not by LA. Based on the prominent protective activity of LA, GST-P1-1 inactivation by ONOOH would be mediated by the bipolar form of ONOOH. The major finding that is in conflict with this theory is the reported reaction of ONOOH by LA with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and a second order rate constant of 1400 m–1 s–1, which is almost identical to that of GSH (1350 m–+ s–1) (4Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Trujillo and Radi (4Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) determined this rate constant by monitoring ONOOH consumption in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. In the same study, the relatively low consumption of LA by ONOOH, identical to the observation depicted in Fig. 1, was also reported. This finding, i.e. the low consumption of LA in this study and study of Trujillo and Radi (4Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), is in conflict with the very high second order rate constant reported. The consumption of LA by increasing amounts of ONOOH should have been identical to that of GSH, as shown in Fig. 2 for HOCl. As shown in Fig. 1, this is clearly not the case for LA consumption by ONOOH. The low consumption of LA by ONOOH is more in line with the hypothesis that only a part of the ONOOH, i.e. the bipolar form, reacts with LA. It should be noted that Trujillo and Radi (4Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) calculated the apparent second order rate constant by dividing the observed rate of ONOOH consumption by the concentration of LA and the concentration of ONOOH. If only part of the ONOOH is able to react with LA, i.e. the bipolar form, the concentration of the bipolar form should have been used in the calculation instead of the total amount of ONOOH. Consequently, the apparent second order rate constant of the reaction of the bipolar form of ONOOH with LA would have been higher than the reported value of the rate of the second order reaction of ONOOH with LA. GSH reacts with both forms of ONOOH, and, therefore, the second order rate constant of GSH cannot be adjusted in the same way as for LA. This would make the true second order rate constant of the reaction of the bipolar form of ONOOH with LA higher than that with GSH. This could explain the higher efficacy of LA compared with GSH in the protection of GST-P1-1. The question arises of from where the high protection of LA originates. It is not the reactivity of the separate sulfur atoms; they are far less reactive than the sulfur in GSH. The most prominent feature of LA is that the sulfur atoms are neighboring in a five-member ring. The orientation of the sulfur atoms in the 1,2-dithiolane ring causes a partial overlap of the lone pz electron pairs of the sulfur atoms. As a consequence, the pz orbitals combine into binding and anti-binding orbitals. The filled anti-binding orbital facilitates the ability of LA to donate electrons; in other words, this facilitates the ability of LA to reduce oxidants such as ONOOH and act as antioxidant. This is the explanation for the reactivity of LA as compared with a linear disulphide, such as GSSG, where an overlap of the pz electron pair is partially absent (6Haenen G.R.M.M. Bast A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 2244-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the reaction scheme proposed (Fig. 3), the anti-binding electron pair binds one of the sulfur atoms to the positively charged nitrogen of the bipolar form of ONOOH. The binding electron that already has a partial double bond character (because of interchange with the free d-levels of the neighboring sulfur atoms) forms a double bond between the sulfur atoms. As a result, the sulfur atom that is not bound to the nitrogen becomes positively charged, and the negatively charged oxygen of the bipolar form of ONOOH binds to this sulfur atom. The intermediate that is formed in this way decomposes to give β-LA and NO2- as shown in Fig. 3. In this reaction scheme it is crucial that the pz orbitals of the two sulfur atoms have been converted into a filled binding orbital and an anti-binding orbital. The net reaction of the proposed reaction scheme is the two-electron oxidation of LA by ONOOH yielding β-LA and NO2-, which is consistent with Trujillo and Radi (4Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results obtained from this study underline that, in the efficacy of a free radical scavenger, the reaction rate of the oxidant with the antioxidant relative to the reaction rate of the oxidant with the detector is a major determinant factor. This is illustrated by the difference in protection of the sulfur-containing compounds against HOCl-induced damage to different targets. The difference in protection against ONOOH of these sulfur-containing antioxidants obtained with different targets illustrated that the molecular mechanisms of the damage inflicted by the reactive species and the molecular mechanism of protection by the antioxidant is of equal importance as the rate for the efficacy of the free radical scavenger. ONOOH damage proceeded via at least two mechanisms. LA does not protect against all forms of ONOOH damage. LA is a poor antioxidant in the form of ONOOH toxicity involved in DHR-123 oxidation. However, in the form of ONOOH toxicity involved in GST-P1-1 inactivation, LA is the most potent sulfur-containing antioxidant in our series. It is proposed that an intermediate product in which both sulfur atoms of LA have reacted is involved in the reaction of ONOOH with LA. The high potency of LA to protect GST-P1-1 against ONOOH might be of interest for the therapeutic action of this drug."

Interestingly, acetylation modulates a broad range of transcription factor activities including DNA binding, protein-protein interaction, protein stability, and transcriptional potency (45Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated whether BETA2, PDX-1, and PAX6 were acetylated in β cells and the significance of this modification in transcriptional control. Only acetylated BETA2 was found, which was shown to facilitate activation by modifying lysines within the bHLH and C-terminal region. DNA Constructs—The cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven wild type and deletion mutants of hamster BETA2 have been described previously (32Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The lysine to arginine mutants were constructed in BETA2 using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The glutathione S-transferase GST:BETA2 and GAL4:BETA2 chimeras were made by fusing polymerase chain reaction-amplified BETA2 fragments in-frame to either GST or the GAL4-(1–149) DNA binding domain (GAL4), respectively (32Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The correctness of each plasmid was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The –238 wild type insulin:chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression plasmid contains rat insulin II gene sequences from –238 to +2 bp (46Robinson G.L.W.G. Peshavaria M. Henderson E.

The p300 wild type (pCMVβ-p300) and HAT domain mutant (pCMVβ-p300DY) have been described previously (47Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr.

The pCI-PCAF and pCI-PCAFΔHAT plasmids contain wild type PCAF and a 497–526 amino acid (aa) deletion mutant, respectively (48Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Insulin:CAT or (GAL4)5E1bCAT were transiently transfected with BETA2 or GAL4:BETA2 by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure (50Whelan J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Stein R. Mol. Cell.

Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar), was used as a cotransfected recovery marker. Extracts were prepared 40–48 h after transfection and analyzed for LUC (51De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) and CAT (52Nordeen S.K. Green III, P.P. Fowles D.M. DNA. 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) enzymatic activity. The CAT activity from the reporter construct was normalized to SV2:LUC activity. Each experiment was repeated several times with at least two different plasmid preparations. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—HIT T-15 and HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids and harvested after 24 h for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. The lysed cells were incubated with antisera to PDX-1, BETA2 (NeuroD1-SC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PAX6 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), acetylated lysine (number 9441, Cell Signaling Technology (www.cellsignal.com)), FLAG (M2, Dr. Tony Weil (Vanderbilt University Medical Center)), Myc (9E10, Sigma), or normal IgG. The PDX-1 polyclonal antiserum was developed to N-terminal (aa 1–75) epitopes (7Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Acetylation in Vitro—The protein acetylation assays were performed as described previously (44Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Reactions (30 μl) were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h with 4–5 μg of GST:BETA2 and 200 ng of PCAF in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium butyrate, and 1 μl of [14C]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences). The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then dried, and the reaction products were visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro Translation and GST Binding Assays—Interactions between BETA2 and PCAF or E47 were assessed by examining binding of in vitro translated PCAF or E47 with GST:BETA2. Wild type and mutant GST:BETA2 proteins were prepared using the manufacturer’s conditions (Amersham Biosciences), and [35S]methionine-labeled PCAF or E47 was synthesized using the TnT kit (Promega). Labeled PCAF was incubated for 1 h in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ZnCl2) with GST:BETA2 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, and the bound protein complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding E47 (11Peshavaria M. Henderson E. Sharma A. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3987-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and wild type or mutant forms of BETA2. Nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (10Whelan J. Cordle S.R. Henderson E. Weil P.A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide to the rat insulin II E-box DNA binding element (5′-TCTGGCCATCTGCTGATCCT-3′) was end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and used as probe. The reactions were performed using 4 μg of nuclear extract under conditions described previously (10Whelan J. Cordle S.R. Henderson E. Weil P.A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NeuroD1-SC antibody (G-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to localize the BETA2-containing complexes. Binding between GST: BETA2 was also analyzed with in vitro translated E12R (53Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a truncated version of E12. The samples were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio 29:1) and run in TGE buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. BETA2 Is Acetylated in β Cells but Not PDX-1 or PAX6 — Because p300- and PCAF-mediated acetylation influences the activity of factors involved in controlling tissue-specific transcription of the insulin gene, we investigated whether endogenous BETA2, PAX6, and/or PDX-1 was found in an acetylated form in β cells. This analysis was performed with an antibody that specifically recognizes protein modified acetyllysine (47Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 54Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Pancreatic β cell line extracts (i.e. βTC3, MIN6, and HIT T-15) were incubated with the anti-acetylated lysine antibody or IgG, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by blotting with antisera recognizing BETA2, PAX6, or PDX-1. BETA2 was immunoprecipitated above the IgG control with the anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Fig. 1). In contrast, neither PAX6 nor PDX-1 was detected in an acetylated form in β nuclear extracts (Fig. 1) (data not shown). These results suggested that BETA2 was acetylated in β cells. The following experiments were designed to identify the lysine(s) in BETA2 that were modified and to determine their consequence to trans-activation. PCAF Acetylates BETA2 in Vivo—To test whether p300 and/or PCAF acetylated BETA2, HIT T-15 cells were cotransfected with Myc-tagged BETA2 and the wild type or an acetylase-defective mutant of p300 or PCAF. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed with the anti-acetylated lysine antibody, and the products were analyzed with a Myc epitope-specific antibody. As expected, an acetylation signal was detected in the BETA2 alone sample because of endogenous acetylase activity (Fig. 2). PCAF stimulated the level of the acetylated BETA2 >3-fold above the BETA2 alone sample (Fig. 2A). In contrast, PCAFΔHAT reduced BETA2 acetylation below the BETA2 alone point, presumably by out-competing the endogenous acetylase(s). However, p300 only very modestly increased the BETA2 acetylation signal above either the HAT defective mutant (p300DY) or BETA2 alone samples (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that BETA2 is primarily acetylated by PCAF in β cells. Properties of the PCAF·BETA2 Complex—To examine features of PCAF important in BETA2 binding, HIT T-15 and HeLa cells were transfected with Myc-BETA2 and FLAG-tagged wild type or PCAFΔHAT expression vectors. Antisera recognizing the Myc epitope precipitated FLAG-tagged PCAF, although no significant signal was observed in the IgG precipitates (Fig. 3). The same result was obtained upon immunoprecipitating with anti-BETA2 antisera (data not shown). Interestingly, the region required for PCAF-mediated acetylation was not necessary for complex formation (Fig. 3), a property also of PCAF interactions with E2F (56Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and Tal1/SCL (57Huang S. Qiu Y. Shi Y. Xu Z. Brandt S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6792-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The ability of PCAFΔHAT to bind BETA2 is consistent with the dominant negative properties of this HAT mutant on BETA2 acetylation in vivo (Fig. 2A). To localize the region(s) of BETA2 involved in PCAF binding, GST pull-down assays were initially carried out with [35S]PCAF and either GST alone or GST-BETA2 fusion proteins. Little, if any, radiolabeled PCAF bound to GST resin alone. In contrast, PCAF bound effectively to the bHLH (aa 100–155) and C-terminal activation (aa 239–355) domains of BETA2 (Fig. 4A). However, the N-terminal acidic-rich domain of BETA2 appears to reduce 1–155 and 1–355 binding to PCAF because both 100–155 and 156–355 interacted more strongly. To test whether bHLH and activation domain sequences of BETA2 were also significant in PCAF binding within cells, these regions were fused in-frame to the DNA binding domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 transcription factor and cotransfected into HeLa cells with a PCAF-VP16 activation domain expression plasmid. The binding of BETA2 to PCAF should enhance transcription from the GAL4 DNA binding site-driven reporter, (GAL4)5E1bCAT. The BETA2 constructs spanning activation domain sequences were the only ones that interacted with PCAF (Fig. 4B). It is unclear why Gal4:BETA2-(100–155) did not bind to PCAF in the two-hybrid assay, although conformation constraints imposed in the smaller amino acid 1–155 and 100–155 fusions may have precluded such interactions. Importantly, the combined results strongly suggest that PCAF can bind, at least, to the activation domain region of BETA2. Potential Sites of Acetylation within BETA2—Having shown that PCAF acetylated BETA2, we next sought to locate the modified lysine(s). To first identify the acetylated region(s) of BETA2, GST:BETA2 fusion constructs were incubated in vitro with [14C]acetyl-CoA and PCAF. The aa 100–155 and 156–239 regions were the most effective substrates for acetylation, and significantly, the non-lysine-rich aa 239–355 domain was not. (Fig. 5A). Unfortunately, a consensus acetylation recognition sequence for non-histone proteins has not been determined, although closely spaced lysines were the preferred targets in the p53 (44Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar), MyoD (58Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and E2F (56Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) transcription factors. The aa 100–155 region of BETA2 contains potential clustered lysine acceptor sites within the loop region of the bHLH domain, whereas there were only two lysine residues within aa 156–239 (Fig. 5B). To exam whether these amino acids were acetylated, the lysines located at aa 132, 135, 138, 160, and 173 were converted to a non-acetylated amino acid (i.e. arginine) within GST:BETA2-(100–155) and GST:BETA2-(156–355), respectively. The lysine to arginine mutation essentially blocked in vitro acetylation by PCAF (compare acetylation of GST:BETA2-(100–155)L-3R and GST:BETA2-(156–355)C-2R with their wild type counterpart in Fig. 5B). These results suggested that a lysine(s) within the loop region of the bHLH (aa 132, 135, and 138) and C-terminal regions (aa 160 and 173) of BETA2 are acetylated by PCAF. Acetylation of the BETA2 Loop Region Potentiates Binding to the Insulin E-box in Vitro—To determine whether acetylation of the bHLH domain influenced the DNA binding capacity of BETA2, PCAF was incubated with the wild type and Lys to Arg mutant of GST:BETA2-(100–155) and then analyzed in the presence of its heterodimeric partner, E12, for insulin E-box binding. PCAF increased wild type BETA2-(100–155) complex binding levels over the bovine serum albumin-treated control in the gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 6). In contrast, GST:BETA2-(100–155)L-3R DNA binding activity was unchanged in the presence of PCAF. To ascertain whether acetylation within the loop region of BETA2 influenced dimerization with E12/E47, PCAF-acetylated wild type and mutant GST:BETA2-(100–155) were immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with labeled E47. The wild type and L-3R mutant bound equally effectively (Fig. 6B, data not shown), indicating that heterodimerization with E12/E47 was unaffected by acetylation. These results indicate that acetylation of lysine 132, 135, and/or 138 of the bHLH domain stimulates BETA2 DNA binding activity. Acetylation Increases the Trans-activation Potential of BETA2—One would predict from our results that the acetylation-deficient bHLH mutant of BETA2 would be less effective at stimulating transcription than the wild type protein, because this mutant binds less effectively. To test this directly, the wild type and Lys to Arg bHLH mutant form of full-length BETA2 were transfected into HeLa cells with an insulin enhancer-driven reporter spanning nucleotides –247 to –197 of the rat insulin I gene. Wild type BETA2 stimulates E-box-mediated transcription from this insulin-driven reporter (Fig. 7A) (35Sharma A. Moore M. Marcora E. Lee J.E. Qiu Y. Samaras S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 18: 704-713Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As expected, BETA2-(1–355)L-3R was a very poor activator. Experiments performed with wild type and mutant-transfected extracts were also consistent with the reduction in BETA2-mediated activation, reflecting a loss in DNA binding activity, rather than a change in protein stability (Fig. 7C, data not shown). Interestingly, the C-terminal Lys to Arg mutant of BETA2 was also less effective than the wild type at activating the insulin –247/–197-bp-driven reporter (Fig. 7A). In contrast to BETA2-(1–355)L-3R, the DNA binding properties of BETA2-(1–355)C-2R were not compromised (Fig. 7C). The bHLH and C-terminal mutants were also defective in stimulating insulin enhancer-driven expression in HIT T-15 β cells. Thus, BETA2-(1–355)C-2R stimulation was roughly 20% of the wild type, whereas BETA2-(1–355)L-3R reduced insulin reporter activity to slightly below the alone transfected point (Fig. 7B). In addition, a dominant negative inhibitory pattern was observed with either BETA2-(1–355)5R in which all five potential BETA2 acetylation sites were mutated (Fig. 7B) or PCAFΔHAT (data not shown). Collectively, these results strongly indicate that the activity of BETA2 is impacted by its acetylation state. Insulin gene transcription is inhibited in islet β cells by the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein (59Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Stein R.W. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4531-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Inhibition results from E1A binding to p300 and preventing the formation of the transcriptional platform between key distal activators of insulin and the basal transcription machinery. Here we considered that the bridging function of p300 might not be the only feature of this coactivator crucial for insulin expression. As a consequence, we first tested whether the acetyltransferase activity of p300 or its associated factor, PCAF, directly modified PDX-1, PAX6, and/or BETA2 in β cells. BETA2 was the only key activator of the insulin found in an acetylated form, a process that appeared to be principally mediated by PCAF. Acetylation of lysine(s) was shown to augment the trans-activation potential of BETA2, at least by stimulating DNA binding. These findings suggest that acetylation of BETA2 plays an important role in regulating islet β cell function. To identify potential acetylated lysines within BETA2, PCAF was incubated in vitro with peptides spanning the bHLH (aa 100–155) and C-terminal (aa 156–239 and 239–355) region. PCAF modified GST fusions containing aa 100–155 and 156–239 but not aa 239–355 (Fig. 5). In addition, acetylation was prevented in these substrates by mutating the potential lysine acceptor sites at aa 132, 135, 138, 160, and 173 to a non-acetylated amino acid (i.e. arginine). These results suggested that an acetylated lysine within the bHLH and C-terminal region enabled the anti-acetyl lysine antisera to immunoprecipitate endogenous BETA2 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, although BETA2 was more effectively acetylated by PCAF in β cell lines (Fig. 2), p300 was capable of acetylating the same BETA2 peptide substrates in vitro and in transfection assays (data not shown). The specific importance of PCAF in regulation was also supported by the observed concomitant decrease in both the level of BETA2 acetylation (Fig. 2) and trans-activation capacity (data not shown) in the presence of the PCAFΔHAT dominant negative-acting mutant. In general terms, these results indicate that, under certain circumstances, either acetyltransferase may be significant to BETA2 stimulation, a characteristic of other transcription factors (p53 (44Gu W.

Gel shift experiments performed with wild type and acetylation-defective mutants of BETA2 suggest that modification of the loop region (i.e. aa 132, 135, and/or 138) potentiates insulin E-box binding activity (Fig. 6). Transfections performed with insulin-driven reporter constructs also demonstrated the importance of lysines 132, 135, and 138 in BETA2-stimulated transactivation (Fig. 7). Acetylation within the loop region of the TAL1 (57Huang S. Qiu Y. Shi Y. Xu Z. Brandt S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6792-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) bHLH protein also results in increased DNA binding activity. Not surprisingly, BETA2 binding activity was unaffected in the acetylation-defective mutant of lysines 160 and 173 because they reside outside of the bHLH domain. However, this mutant did have reduced transactivation properties (Fig. 7). Although inactivity probably results from limiting interactions with a key coactivator, p300 binding to the aa 156–251 domain (56Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) was not influenced in the lysine 160 and 173 mutant (data not shown). Importantly, our data support the hypothesis that acetylation of BETA2 plays a role in activation of the insulin gene and that this post-translation modification provides specific control properties to this activator and not other crucial control factors (i.e. PDX-1 and PAX-6). In addition, because acetylation appears to principally regulate BETA2 binding activity, it is also likely to be generally applicable to the mechanism of activation of additional target genes in the islet and brain. We speculate that in BETA2-regulated genes, transcriptional synergy will not only depend upon recruitment of common bridging cofactors, like p300, but also the acetyltransferase activity inherent in PCAF and p300. If correct, it is possible that the interplay between acetyltransferases and deacetylases that is significant in controlling nucleosomal structure and gene activation may also be involved in directly regulating metabolic and differentiation control responses regulated by BETA2.

Deregulation of the G1-S checkpoint contributes to uncontrolled cell division, a hallmark of cancer. We have reported previously that cyclin E is overexpressed in breast cancer and such overexpression is usually accompanied by the appearance of low molecular weight isoforms of cyclin E protein, which are not present in normal cells. Furthermore, we have shown that the expression of cyclin E low molecular weight isoforms can be used as a reliable prognostic marker for breast cancer to predict patient outcome. In this study we examined the role of cyclin E in directly activating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2. For this purpose, a series of N-terminal deleted forms of cyclin E corresponding to the low molecular weight forms detected only in cancer cells were translated in vitro and mixed with cell extracts. These tumor-specific N-terminal deleted forms of cyclin E are able to activate CDK2. Addition of cyclin E into both normal and tumor cell extracts was shown to increase the levels of CDK2 activity, along with an increase in the amount of phosphorylated CDK2. The increase in CDK2 activity was because of cyclin E binding to endogenous CDK2 in complex with endogenous cyclin E, cyclin A, or unbound CDK2. The increase in CDK2 phosphorylation was through a pathway involving cyclin-activating kinase, but addition of cyclin E to an extract containing unphosphorylated CDK2 can still lead to increase in CDK2 activity. Our data suggest that the ability of high levels of full-length and low molecular weight forms of cyclin E to activate CDK2 may be one mechanism that leads to the constitutive activation of cyclin E·CDK2 complexes leading to G1/S deregulation and tumor progression. Cyclin E, a positive regulator of the cell cycle, controls the transition of cells from G1 to S phase. Deregulation of the G1-S checkpoint contributes to uncontrolled cell division, a hallmark of cancer. We have reported previously that cyclin E is overexpressed in breast cancer and such overexpression is usually accompanied by the appearance of low molecular weight isoforms of cyclin E protein, which are not present in normal cells. Furthermore, we have shown that the expression of cyclin E low molecular weight isoforms can be used as a reliable prognostic marker for breast cancer to predict patient outcome. In this study we examined the role of cyclin E in directly activating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2. For this purpose, a series of N-terminal deleted forms of cyclin E corresponding to the low molecular weight forms detected only in cancer cells were translated in vitro and mixed with cell extracts. These tumor-specific N-terminal deleted forms of cyclin E are able to activate CDK2. Addition of cyclin E into both normal and tumor cell extracts was shown to increase the levels of CDK2 activity, along with an increase in the amount of phosphorylated CDK2. The increase in CDK2 activity was because of cyclin E binding to endogenous CDK2 in complex with endogenous cyclin E, cyclin A, or unbound CDK2. The increase in CDK2 phosphorylation was through a pathway involving cyclin-activating kinase, but addition of cyclin E to an extract containing unphosphorylated CDK2 can still lead to increase in CDK2 activity. Our data suggest that the ability of high levels of full-length and low molecular weight forms of cyclin E to activate CDK2 may be one mechanism that leads to the constitutive activation of cyclin E·CDK2 complexes leading to G1/S deregulation and tumor progression. Cyclin E has an important role in the regulation of the restriction point transition in the cell cycle. In normal cells, cyclin E expression occurs during a brief window of time from late G1 into early S phase, with a peak expression level near the restriction point (1Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Kinase activity of cyclin E·CDK2 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CAK, cyclin-activating kinase; KAP, CDK-associated phosphatase; LMW, low molecular weight; ID, immunodepleted. 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CAK, cyclin-activating kinase; KAP, CDK-associated phosphatase; LMW, low molecular weight; ID, immunodepleted. complexes are also at maximum levels near the restriction point (2Koff A. Giordano A. Desia D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Nishomoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 3Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). Cyclin E activation of CDK2 is an essential step in cell cycle progression through the restriction point. There are several examples that demonstrate the importance of cyclin E·CDK2 complexes in transition from G1 to S phase. For example, functional knockout of cyclin E by injection of anti-cyclin E antibodies into fibroblast cells causes cell arrest in G1 of the cell cycle (4Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 5Tsai L.-H. Lees E. Faha B. Harlow E. Riabowol K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1593-1602PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the overexpression of cyclin E protein results in a decrease in the length of G1, along with a decreased cell size (6Coulonval K. Bockstaele L. Paternot S. Roger P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar, 7Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of a dominant negative CDK2, which is deficient in its ability to phosphorylate substrates, in U2OS osteosarcoma, Saos-2 osteosarcoma, C33A cervical carcinoma, or T98G glioblastoma cells, causes G1 phase arrest (8van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Cyclin E binding is not the only step required for CDK2 activation. The activity of CDK2 is also dependent upon its phosphorylation state at the amino acid Thr-160 (9Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar); mutation of the Thr-160 site abolishes all CDK2 kinase activity in vitro, pinpointing it as a site of activating phosphorylation (9Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Tyr-15 or Thr-14 sites increases kinase activity, suggesting that these amino acids are the site of inhibitory phosphorylation (9Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Thr-160 is performed by cyclin-activating kinase (CAK), a complex composed of cyclin H and CDK7 (10Sclafani R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CAK was first identified as a factor present in cell extracts that could activate purified CDC2 in vitro (11Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Solomon M.J. Lee T. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Purification of the CAK complex led to the identification of its two subunits, cyclin H and CDK7 (13Solomon M.J. Harper J.W. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 14Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). CDK7 is the catalytic subunit of CAK, which phosphorylates CDK substrates (13Solomon M.J. Harper J.W. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Poon R.Y. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). CDK7 does not contain catalytic activity alone; it requires binding with cyclin H to become active (4Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 14Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 15Poon R.Y. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized cyclin H·CDK7 complexes were shown to phosphorylate both CDK2 and CDC2 (14Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Negative regulation of CDK phosphorylation at Thr-160 is mediated by the CDK-associated phosphatase (KAP) (17Poon R.Y. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). KAP has been shown to dephosphorylate Thr-160 of CDK2 in vitro, by direct association with the CDK (17Poon R.Y. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation event is blocked by cyclin binding, but KAP is still able to associate with the cyclin·CDK complex as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (17Poon R.Y. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Inhibitory phosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 of CDK2 is a function of Wee1, mammalian homologue of the yeast wee1 (18Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells also have a homologue to yeast CDC25, which is a phosphatase that removes the inhibitory phosphorylation at Thr-14 and Tyr-15 (18Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). Together, the phosphorylation state of CDK2 at three separate amino acids under the control of CAK (Thr-160 activating phosphorylation), KAP (Thr-160 inhibitory dephosphorylation), Wee1 (Tyr-15, Thr-14 inhibitory phosphorylation), and CDC25 (Tyr-15, Thr-14 activating dephosphorylation), give the cell additional levels of control over CDK2 activity and cell cycle progression, beyond cyclin binding. However, cyclins are the major positive regulators of the cell cycle and determinants of CDK activation within the cell. Furthermore, many cyclins have been shown to have a strong involvement in tumor development, including cyclins E, D, and A (19Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar, 20Donnellan R. Chetty R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The role of cyclin E as a CDK2 activator in control of restriction point transition in the cell cycle (21Dou Q.-P. Levin A.H. Zhao S. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1493-1497PubMed Google Scholar) makes cyclin E an excellent candidate as a protein involved in tumor development. Cyclin E deregulations are commonly seen in tumor cell lines, as well as tumor tissues from breast cancer patients (20Donnellan R. Chetty R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Keyomarsi K. Herliczek T. Meijer L. Guidet S. Philippe M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. 3. Plenum Press, New York1997: 171-191Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cell cycle regulation of cyclin E expression is commonly lost in tumor cells, leading to constitutive cyclin E expression throughout the cell cycle (23Keyomarsi K. Conte D. Toyofuku W. Fox M.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 941-950PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sgambato A. Han E.K. Zhou P. Schieren I. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sgambato A. Zhang Y.J. Arber N. Hibshoosh H. Doki Y. Ciaparrone M. Santella R. Cittadini A. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Can. Res. 1997; 3: 1879-1887PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor cells commonly overexpress cyclin E protein (26Harwell R.M. Porter D.C. Danes C. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar), which is accompanied by the appearance of low molecular weight (LMW) isoforms, which are not present in normal cells (26Harwell R.M. Porter D.C. Danes C. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar, 27Keyomarsi K. O'Leary N. Molnar G. Lees E. Fingert H.J. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 380-385PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nielsen N.H. Arnerlov C. Emdin S.O. Landberg G. Br. J. Canc. 1996; 74: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our previous studies suggest that these LMW forms are generated in breast tumor cells by post-translational modification of the full-length cyclin E by the elastase class of serine proteases (26Harwell R.M. Porter D.C. Danes C. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar, 29Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to the full-length protein at 50-kDa, we have identified five LMW forms that are generated mainly by proteolysis at two domains in cyclin E, which results in two pairs of closely migrating doublets (EL-2/EL-3 and EL-5/EL-6). These isoforms, when in complex with CDK2, are biochemically hyperactive, as evidenced by their enhanced ability to phosphorylate histone H1 and GST-Rb (29Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) compared with full-length cyclin E·CDK2 complex. When transfected into normal mammary epithelial cells, the LMW forms have significant mitogenic effect, readily inducing cells to enter the cell cycle (26Harwell R.M. Porter D.C. Danes C. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar, 29Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Porter D.C. Keyomarsi K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E101Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Clinically, we have also shown that the presence of the LMW forms in breast cancer patients is associated with increasing grade and stage (27Keyomarsi K. O'Leary N. Molnar G. Lees E. Fingert H.J. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 380-385PubMed Google Scholar), as well as a significantly worse prognosis (31Keyomarsi K. Tucker S.L. Buchholz T.A. Callister M. Ding Y. Hortobagyi G.N. Bedrosian I. Knickerbocker C. Toyofuku W. Lowe M. Herliczek T.W. Bacus S.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 32Keyomarsi K. Tucker S.L. Bedrosian I. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 152Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The question we address in this work is whether overexpression of cyclin E in tumor cells has the ability to directly activate CDK2. The strategy we use is to mix in vitro translated cyclin E (full-length or the LMW forms) with tumor cell extracts and assess the role of the exogenous cyclin E in activating endogenous CDK2. Here we provide evidence that the addition of cyclin E (both full-length and LMW) results in the activation of CDK2 in both normal or tumor cell extracts. Vectors and Cloning—The pCDNA3.1 vector alone or vector containing FLAG-tagged cyclin EL, E, T1, T2, or T3 was used to produce cyclin E protein products in vitro. The generation of all vectors was described previously (26Harwell R.M. Porter D.C. Danes C. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cell lysates were prepared by resuspension in protease phosphatase buffer (25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) in Solution A (27 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 3.3 mm KCl, 13 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH7.6), to prevent protein degradation. Cell lysates were homogenized by sonication followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The soluble supernatant fraction was removed, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Transcription/Translation and Mixing—Synthesis of the five FLAG-tagged cyclin E constructs was examined using a coupled in vitro rabbit reticulocyte transcription/translation (TnT) kit (Promega). pCDNA3.1 plasmid containing the cyclin E inserts (EL, cyclin E, T1, T2, or T3) or no insert was added to the reaction mix at 0.02 μg/μl with 1 mm amino acid mixture for 90 min at 30 °C. TnT samples were then used in mixing experiments. For mixing, 2 μl (∼3 ng) of in vitro synthesized cyclin EL, cyclin E, T1, T2, or T3, or pCDNA3.1 with no insert was added to tumor MDA-MB-157 or normal 76N cell extracts. Either 300 or 37.5 μg of cell extract was used per mixing, as indicated per experiment. Mixing reactions were performed at 4 °C overnight. The amount of protein produced by the TnT reaction was calculated as follows for a 50-kDa protein with 10 methionine (Met) residues per protein (Promega). 2 μl of 10mCi/ml [35S]Met with a specific activity of 1200Ci/mmol was added to the reaction (2 μl)(10 μCi/μl)/(1200 Ci) = 16.7 pmol of [35S]Met. 135 pmol of cold Met was also added to a 50-μl TnT reaction, giving a concentration of 151.7 pmol of total Met. 10% incorporation Met yields 15 pmol of Met incorporated into 10 Met sites per protein. (50,000 pg)/(10 pmol Met) × (15 pmol Met incorporated) yields 75 ng of protein per 50 μl of TnT reaction (Promega). This is an estimation of the amount of protein produced by the TnT reaction, independent of the number of Met residues per protein. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assays—For immunoprecipitations and H1 kinase assays, 300 or 37.5 μg of cell extract was used per immunoprecipitation with either polyclonal antibody to FLAG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or CDK2 (29Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 7.5 μl of crude rabbit polyclonal CDK2 serum was added to either 300 or 37.5 μg as indicated for each experiment. For the FLAG immunoprecipitation, 0.01 μg of FLAG polyclonal antibody was added to 300 μg for immunoprecipitation. The antibody binding reaction was carried out in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The protein/antibody mixture was incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h and then washed four times with lysis buffer and four times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by either Western blot analysis or H1 kinase assay. For Western blot analysis, protein A-Sepharose beads from immunoprecipitation were boiled in SDS, and proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel as described previously (26Harwell R.M. Porter D.C. Danes C. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed with monoclonal anti-CDK2 (1 μg/ml), anti-cyclin E (0.1 μg/ml), anti-p21 (1 μg/ml), anti-p27 (1 μg/ml), anti-cyclin A (1 μg/ml), or anti-CDK7 (1 μg/ml) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). For the kinase assay, immunoprecipitates were incubated with kinase buffer (5 μg of histone H1, 60 μm ATP, μCi of [32P]δATP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in a final volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 30 min. H1 kinase reactions were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was then stained, de-stained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. For quantification, the histone H1 bands were excised, and radioactivity was measured by Cerenkov counting on a Beckman LS-9000 Scintillation Counter. Immunodepletion—For these analyses the antibodies were first conjugated to beads before being used for immunoprecipitation. Non-affinity-purified anti-cyclin E rabbit serum polyclonal (0.33 μl per 1 μl of beads), affinity-purified cyclin A rabbit serum polyclonal (0.03 μl per 1 μl of beads), or CDK7 (0.17 μg/μl) polyclonal antibodies were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h to conjugate the antibody to the beads. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and added to 1 mg of cell extract. Antibody-bead conjugates or beads alone were incubated with cell extracts for 1 h at 4 °C for antibody-antigen binding to take place, removed, and replaced with fresh beads for a total of three rounds of depletion. Antibody-bead conjugates were washed four times with lysis buffer and four times with kinase buffer to remove nonspecific protein interactions. Protein concentrations of immunodepleted cell extracts were then determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. Immunodepleted cell extracts were then used in mixing experiments with cyclin EL and T3. 3 ng of in vitro synthesized cyclin EL and T3 was mixed with 37.5 μg of depleted cell extracts, immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK2 antibodies, and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-cyclin E, anti-cyclin A, anti-CDK2, anti-CDK7 antibodies, or histone H1 kinase assay. Expression of Wild-type and Mutant CDK2 in Insect Cells— Recombinant virus expressing wild-type CDK2 was generated using the BaculoGold vector system (PharMingen) as described previously (29Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Virus expressing hemagglutinin-tagged T160A mutant CDK2 was obtained as a gift from the laboratory of J. Wade Harper (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Sf9 insect cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection number of 1 and harvested at 65 h post-infection. Protein extracts were subjected to Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and H1 kinase analysis as described above. The Thr-160 phospho-specific CDK2 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). To examine the ability of the LMW forms of cyclin E (i.e. cyclin EL1–6) to activate CDK2, a series of five epitope-tagged (i.e. FLAG), full-length, or N-terminal truncated cyclin E cDNAs that correspond to different LMW forms were generated (Fig. 1A). These forms, described previously (26Harwell R.M. Porter D.C. Danes C. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar), include cyclin EL (EL1), cyclin E, T1 (EL2/3), T2 (EL5/6), and T3. Cyclin EL, T1, and T2 correspond exactly to the forms of cyclin E found endogenously in tumor cells, which we refer to as EL-1 (51 kDa), EL2/3 (44 kDa), and EL5/6 (40 kDa), respectively (29Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cyclin E refers to the 45-kDa form originally cloned via yeast complementation assays (1Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 33Koff A. Cross F. Fisher A. Schumacher J. Leguellec K. Philippe M. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 1217-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We recently provided evidence that this form, an alternatively spliced variant of cyclin EL, does not give rise to any major protein products in human cell lines (29Porter D. Zhang N. Danes C. McGrehan M. Harwell R. Farouk S. Keyomarsi K. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2001; 21: 6254-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In vitro expression of the cyclin EL, T1, T2, and T3 span the size range of LMW forms seen in tumor cells from 52 kDa to 37 kDa as we have already described (26Harwell R.M. Porter D.C. Danes C. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether N-terminal deleted cyclin E forms are able to bind to and activate CDK2 in vitro, the in vitro translated products of the five cyclin E forms were each mixed separately with MDA-MB-157 tumor cell extract. The cell extract mixture was then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and subjected to both CDK2 immunoblotting (Fig. 1B) and H1 kinase assay (Fig. 1C). The results revealed that all five cyclin E forms were able to co-immunoprecipitate with CDK2, suggesting each was able to bind to CDK2 (Fig. 1B). However only EL, E, T1, and T2 were able to activate CDK2, as shown by their ability to phosphorylate histone H1, whereas T3, despite binding with CDK2, was unable to cause activation (Fig. 1C). Additionally, T3 can only bind to the inactive, slower migrating form of CDK2 (Fig. 1C). The identity of the active, phosphorylated, faster-migrating band of CDK2 has been determined previously (9Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Specifically, the authors show that the activating phosphorylation of CDK2 results in the appearance of the faster migrating CDK2 band. They also indicated that the phosphorylated residues in CDK2 can be identified based on their predicted mobilities. Additionally the authors, through metabolically labeling of cells transfected with T160A form of CDK2 were able to unequivocally label the faster migrating band as the Thr-160 form of CDK2. The results with T3 are consistent with previous reports indicating cyclin binding to CDK2 is an independent event from substrate recognition and phosphorylation (34Horton L.E. Templeton D.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The results obtained in Fig. 1 provide the opportunity to explore the in vitro biochemical consequences of expression of both full-length cyclin E (EL), which can activate CDK2, and an N-terminal deleted cyclin E (T3), which cannot activate CDK2, using normal and tumor cell extracts. The kinase assay for Fig. 1 was performed with anti-FLAG antibody, to separate the kinase activity of the in vitro translated cyclin E from the endogenous cyclins E and A, which also complex with CDK2. To compare the effects of cyclin EL and T3 on the overall kinase activity in normal and tumor cells, an antibody to CDK2 was employed to capture the immune complexes (Fig. 2). For these experiments 3 ng of in vitro translated cyclin EL and T3 were mixed with 37.5 μg of tumor and normal cell extract, immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK2 antibodies, and subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A) and H1 kinase assay (Fig. 2B). The level of phosphorylated CDK2 captured is increased by the addition of cyclin EL (Fig. 2A, Tumor, Cyclin EL; Normal, Cyclin EL), and to a lesser extent by the addition of T3 (Fig. 2A, Tumor, T3; Normal, T3) in both normal and tumor extracts. Tumor cells have a higher level of endogenous phosphorylated CDK2 than normal cells before addition of any cyclin E (Fig. 2A, Tumor, Vector alone; Normal, Vector alone). Addition of cyclin EL causes an increase in CDK2 activity from about 45,000 to 110,000 cpm in tumor extracts (Fig. 2B, Tumor, Cyclin EL) and from about 6,000 to 35,000 cpm in normal cell extracts (Fig. 2B, Normal, Cyclin EL). Addition of T3, on the other hand, resulted in less of an increase in CDK2 activity, up to 70,000 cpm in tumor cell extracts (Fig. 2B, Tumor, T3) and up to 12,000 cpm in normal extracts (Fig. 2B, Normal, T3), showing only a 2-fold induction of CDK2 activity over basal levels. Hence, binding to non-phosphorylated CDK2 also causes an increase in CDK2 activity, albeit at a lower level, which may explain the low levels of CDK2 kinase activity seen with T3 despite the fact that T3 does not complex to phosphorylated CDK2. These results suggest that when exogenous cyclin E protein, in the form of in vitro synthesized cyclin EL, was added to the cell extracts, two events occurred: (i) the amount of phosphorylated (active) CDK2 was higher than in normal and tumor cells without exogenous cyclin E, and (ii) the overall CDK2 activity increased 3–6-fold over basal levels in normal and tumor cells. In both cases tumor cells have a higher level of basal CDK2 levels and activity than normal cells. These two results raise questions as to what is causing the increase in phosphorylated CDK2 captured by immunoprecipitation and what is causing the increase in CDK2 activity. There are several possible sources for the increase in CDK2 activity following addition of cyclin E into cell extracts. These potential sources are (i) an intrinsic activity in the TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate, (ii) binding of exogenous cyclin E to free monomeric CDK2, (iii) binding of exogenous cyclin E to CDK2 competing off endogenous cyclin A or cyclin E or, (iv) increased stability of active CDK2 because of bound exogenous cyclin E. The first and most logical source of increased kinase activity examined was a potential intrinsic activity within the TnT reaction, which was used in each mix. The TnT reaction mix used to synthesize cyclin E in vitro contains rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate, being a cell extract itself, would contain cell cycle proteins that could potentially contribute to histone phosphorylation. To address this possibility, rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT) alone or mixed with cyclin EL or T3 was immunoprecipitated with CDK2, and subjected to H1 kinase assay (Fig. 3). 300 μg of tumor cell extract alone (in the presence of TnT mix) or mixed with cyclin EL TnT or T3 TnT was also immunoprecipitated with CDK2 and subjected to H1 kinase assay in the same experiment to compare side by side contribution of TnT mix to CDK2 activity from cell extracts (Fig. 3). TnT alone or mixed with T3 showed only background activity at about 1,000 cpm (Fig. 3). TnT mixed with cyclin EL showed a slight increase over background levels. However, an increase in CDK2 activity from 57,000 (tumor extracts alone plus TnT mix) to 135,000 cpm occurred from addition of cyclin EL TnT to tumor extracts. Addition of T3 TnT to extracts caused an increase from 57,000 to 82,000 cpm. The difference in activity caused by addition of cyclin EL to cell extracts is 120,000 cpm higher than the activity in TnT mixed with cyclin EL (Fig. 3, TnT Cyclin EL), suggesting that the activity in the TnT cann"

Physico-chemical properties of GN carbohydrate moieties, such as size, composition, and resistance to most glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, distinguish them from any other type of known glycoproteins. The molecular mechanism of GN-mediated self/non-self discrimination function is based on highly species-specific and Ca2+-dependent GN to GN associations that approach the selectivity of the evolutionarily advanced immunoglobulin superfamily. Carbohydrates of glyconectins 1, 2, and 3 are essential for species-specific auto-aggregation properties in three respective Porifera species. To obtain a structural insight into the molecular mechanisms, we performed carbohydrate structural analyses of glyconectins isolated from the three sponge model systems, Microciona prolifera (GN1), Halichondria panicea (GN2), and Cliona celata (GN3). The glycan content of all three GNs ranged between 40 and 60% of their total mass. Our approach using sequential and selective chemical degradation of GN glycans and subsequent mass spectrometric and NMR analyses revealed that each glyconectin presents novel and highly species-specific carbohydrate sequences. All three GNs include distinct acid-resistant and acid-labile carbohydrate domains, the latter composed of novel repetitive units.

In the preceding article (22Misevic G.N. Guerardel Y. Sumanovski L.T. Slomianny M.-C. Demarty M. Ripoll C. Karamanos Y. Maes E. Popescu O. Strecker G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15579-15590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) the molecular mechanism of GN-mediated self/non-self discrimination was shown to be based on highly species-specific and Ca2+-dependent glyconectin to glyconectin associations operating via carbohydrates. The selectivity of these macromolecular interactions approached that of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Based on these findings xeno-selectivity of GN to GN recognition in Porifera, the closest existing relatives to the primordial multicellular organisms, was proposed to be a new self-assembly paradigm in the cellular adhesion and recognition pathway during the evolution of multicellular forms of life and the divergence of species. Early work on purified carbohydrates of Microciona prolifera glyconectin 1, published in 1987 and 1993 (1Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and followed by experiments on synthetic oligosaccharide epitopes in 2001 (3Haseley S.R. Vermeer H.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9419-9424Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), showed that GN1 functions in cell aggregation via glycan to glycan interactions. Although the carbohydrates of GN2 and GN3, purified from Halichondria panicea and Cliona celata, respectively, are functional in cell adhesion and recognition, it remains to be demonstrated whether they operate as GN1 through glycan to glycan associations. An analogous molecular mechanism of carbohydrate-carbohydrate binding involvement in cell adhesion and recognition was described somewhat later, in 1989, in mammalian cell culture systems (4Eggens I.

Carbohydrate self-association is complementary to well studied lectin-glycan interactions where the role of carbohydrates in cellular interactions has been well documented for more than two decades (9Rabinovich G.A. Rubinstein N. Toscano M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 10Lowe J.B. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Porifera glyconectin carbohydrates account for 40-60% of their total mass. However, their precise structure is still largely unknown. Only four short oligosaccharides, generated by mild hydrolysis of GN1, have been characterized as a new type of pyruvilated and sulfated oligosaccharide sequences, but their arrangement within the glycan moiety is unknown (11Spillmann D.

These initial sequence analyses of GN1 glycans, represented mainly by two macromolecular species with molar masses of 200 and 6 kD (1Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), revealed that they represent a novel class of acidic and fucose-containing polysaccharides different from those of classical glycosaminoglycans. Purified carbohydrates from GN2 and GN3 showed unconventional monosaccharide composition, which, together with their resistance to known glycosaminoglycans degrading enzymes, indicated a type of structure yet to be described (see preceding article (22Misevic G.N. Guerardel Y. Sumanovski L.T. Slomianny M.-C. Demarty M. Ripoll C. Karamanos Y. Maes E. Popescu O. Strecker G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15579-15590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that GN2 contains one major glycan of molar mass 180 × 103 and that GN3 contains one of 110 × 103 (see preceding article (22Misevic G.N. Guerardel Y. Sumanovski L.T. Slomianny M.-C. Demarty M. Ripoll C. Karamanos Y. Maes E. Popescu O. Strecker G. J. Biol.

The absence of information on the details of the structural diversity of glyconectin carbohydrates has greatly impaired investigations into their possible function as the molecular basis for the species-specificity of glyconectins. The sequencing work presented here provides the first detailed comparative structural information on the glycan moieties of the glyconectins isolated from the M. prolifera, H. panicea, and C. celata. This work therefore allows the first steps toward the comprehensive modeling of glycan moieties of glyconectins required to answer the following essential questions. (a) Does the phenomenon of carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction account for cell-cell adhesion in species other than M. prolifera? (b) Is the species specificity of recognition displayed by glyconectins related to structural differences in their glycan moieties? (c) How did glyconectins evolve to generate species-specific recognition? Detailed carbohydrate structural analyses of three glyconectins isolated from M. prolifera (GN1), H. panicea (GN2), and C. celata (GN3) are presented here. The sequential and selective chemical degradation of these three GN glycans, followed by mass spectrometric and NMR analyses of the fragments, resulted in chemical fingerprints revealing new types of species-specific structures and, in particular, sulfated glycan sequences in GN1, branched pyruvilated sequences in GN2, and linear sulfate structures in GN3. Although the sequences of the three GNs are different, they share some common general structural elements of highly negatively charged polymers having pyruvate and/or sulfate on hexose or N-acetylhexosamine in alternation with pentose or deoxyhexose. Isolation of Glyconectin Proteoglycans—Glyconectins were extracted from fresh cuts of sponges with artificial Ca2+- and Mg2+-free seawater (ACMFSW; 462 mm NaCl, 10.7 mm KCl, 7 mm Na2SO4 and 2.1 mm NaHCO3) at +4 °C for 12 h and purified by sequential centrifugation, 20 mm CaCl2 precipitation, and ultracentrifugation (1Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical Degradation of Glyconectins—Glyconectins were hydrolyzed repetitively under mild conditions (0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C for 1 h). After each hydrolysis step, four volumes of ethanol were added, and the liberated oligosaccharides were collected in the ethanol fraction. Release of oligosaccharides from glyconectins was assessed by TLC analysis on silica gel using butanol/acetic acid/H2O (40/30/20) as solvent. Typically, four hydrolysis steps were sufficient to liberate all hydrolysable material. Oligosaccharides were further purified by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (Bio-Rad). GN1 oligosaccharides were reduced by NaBH4 and GN2 and GN3 oligosaccharides by NaBD4 in aqueous NH4OH 1% solution. Eventually permethylation was done according to Ciucanu and Kerek (13Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3157) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS—A Vision 2000 time-of-flight instrument (Finnigan Mat) MALDI-MS equipped with a 337-nm UV laser was used for molecular mass measurements of oligosaccharides. 1 μl of sample at a concentration of 100 pmol/μl was mixed with an equal volume of matrix and allowed to crystallize. 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 3-aminoquinoline was used for neutral and acidic oligosaccharides, respectively. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—Triple quadrupole instrument (Micromass Ltd., Altrincham, UK) fitted with an atmospheric pressure ionization electrospray source was used for MS measurements in positive and negative ion mode. A mixture of polypropylene glycol was used to calibrate the quadrupole mass spectrometer. Underivated oligosaccharide were dissolved in methanol/water (50/50) and permethylated oligosaccharides in acetonitrile, in both cases at concentration of 10 pmol/μl. Nanoflow probe at 50 nl/min was used for infusion. Quadrupole was scanned from 200 to 2000 Da with a scan duration of 3 s and a scan delay of 0.1 s. The samples were sprayed using 1.4 kV needle voltage, and the declustering (cone) was typically set at 70 V. For collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments, the pressure of argon was set at 4 × 10-3 mbar and the collision energy was set to values ranging from 25 to 75 eV. NMR Spectroscopy—Bruker® ASX400 and DMX600 spectrometers, both equipped with a 5-mm 1H/13C mixed probe-head operating in the pulse Fourier transform mode controlled by an Aspect 3000 computer, were used for NMR experiments. Oligosaccharides were dissolved in 400 μl of 2H2O after three exchanges with 2H2O (99.97% atom 2H, Euriso-top, CEA group, Gif-sur-Yvette France) and intermediate lyophilizations. NMR analyses were performed at 300 K. The chemical shifts (δ) were referenced to internal acetone (δ1H = 2.225 and δ13C = 31.55 ppm under the conditions used). Two-dimensional homonuclear (COSY90, TOCSY) and heteronuclear (HMQC) experiments were performed using standard Bruker® pulse programs. The main pulses and variable delays were optimized for each pulse program and sample. Gas Chromatography—Monosaccharides were analyzed by GC/MS as per(trimethylsilyl) (14Kamerling J.P. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and per(heptafluorobutyryl) derivatives (15Zanetta J.P. Timmerman P. Leroy Y. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Methylation of oligosaccharides was done as described by Ciucanu and Kerek (13Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3157) Google Scholar) before analysis on GC/MS. Other Analytical Methods—Oligosaccharide size was measured by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-2 or P-4 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in acetic acid 0.5% and calibrated with hydrolyzed dextran in combination with thin layer chromatography. Amino acid composition was analyzed by Pico-Tag high pressure liquid chromatography, and SO42- content was analyzed by Dionex ion-exchange HPAEC, both after 6 m HCl hydrolysis at 100 °C for 12 h. Compositional Analysis—As demonstrated previously, the three glyconectins GN1, GN2, and GN3, showed species-specific carbohydrate compositions (see preceding article (22Misevic G.N. Guerardel Y. Sumanovski L.T. Slomianny M.-C. Demarty M. Ripoll C. Karamanos Y. Maes E. Popescu O. Strecker G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15579-15590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). GN1 was characterized by a fucose content of one-third of the total monosaccharide content and minute amounts of Py(4,6)Gal. GN2 had lower proportion of fucose and a molar ratio of Py(4,6)Gal three times higher than GN1. GN3 had high quantities of fucose but no Py(4,6)Gal at all and was the only glyconectin to contain arabinose (10% mol/mol). Generation of Oligosaccharides—To compare their carbohydrate moieties, the three glyconectins were fragmented by partial acid hydrolysis. GNs were hydrolyzed repetitively under mild conditions using 0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C for 1 h. After each hydrolysis step, the liberated oligosaccharides were extracted by ethanol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These hydrolysis conditions were devised to preserve most of the hexose (Hex) and N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc) linkages, as well as the pyruvate and sulfate groups, and to cleave the more fragile deoxyhexose (dHex) and pentose (Pent) linkages. In addition, hydrolysis products were removed repeatedly in an attempt to preserve some of the labile sequences containing Fuc or Ara residues. The stepwise release of oligosaccharides from glyconectins was monitored by TLC analysis of the ethanol-soluble fractions. Liberated oligosaccharides showed a constant size from the first to the last hydrolysis step, suggesting that identical material was sequentially cleaved off of the glyconectins by partial hydrolyses (data not shown). The ethanol-soluble fractions of each species were pooled for analysis. Typically, four hydrolysis steps were sufficient to liberate all hydrolysable material. After hydrolyses were completed, ethanol-insoluble fractions were extracted by water to separate the possible ethanol-insoluble oligosaccharides from the remaining-insoluble glycoproteins. In GN1, a minor water-soluble fraction (6% of the total initial sugar content) was extracted this way, whereas in GN2 and GN3 no water-soluble components were observed as revealed by TLC and confirmed by sugar analyses (data not shown). This suggested that the vast majority of hydrolyzed sugars were ethanol-soluble and that the ethanol-insoluble fraction was essentially composed of unhydrolyzed, denatured glycoprotein. In similar conditions, the three glyconectins exhibited distinct susceptibility to acid hydrolysis as reflected by the proportions of carbohydrate in the ethanol-soluble fraction after hydrolysis: 68% of the total carbohydrate content for GN1, 56% for GN2, and 41% for GN3. Analysis of each fraction (Table I) revealed that the hydrolyzed materials had very distinct sugar compositions compared with unhydrolyzed materials. In particular, cleaved oligosaccharides were systematically enriched in fucose and arabinose compared with unhydrolyzed fractions. This reflects the preferential cleavage by partial hydrolysis of domains of the molecule rich in acid-labile linkages. On the contrary, glucuronic acid was retrieved predominantly in hydrolysis-resistant fractions. All of these data strongly suggested that the carbohydrate moieties of glyconectins are not constituted by homogeneous polymers but rather by structurally unrelated domains, an acid-labile, presumably external, domain and an acid-resistant polysaccharidic core. This work concentrated on the comparison of the acid-labile domains of glyconectins from the three species by sequencing the hydrolyzed oligosaccharides.Table IFragmentation of glyconectin polysaccharidesGN1GN2GN3SupernatantPelletSupernatantPelletSupernatantPelletmol %mol %mol %Ara0000105Fuc3611452214Man41218331918Gal27372833815GalNAc0010156GlcNAc282919272638Py(4,6)Gal2429200GlcA370005 Open table in a new tab Sequencing of GN1—TLC analysis of GN1 hydrolysate showed that the apparent size of the released oligosaccharides ranged from 2 to 6 degrees of polymerization (Fig. 1). These oligosaccharides almost exclusively contained Fuc, Gal, and GlcNAc with traces of Man, GlcA, and Py(4,6)Gal. Considering that Gal represents about 95% of the total number of hexoses detected, all hexose residues within the described sequences could be attributed to Gal. For the same reasons, dHex and HexNAc residues could be assigned to Fuc and GlcNAc monosaccharides, respectively. The fraction of released oligosaccharides was analyzed by ES/MS-MS in positive and negative modes before and after reduction with NaBH4 in order to obtain their primary sequences (Fig. 2). The structural information collected from these experiments is summarized in Table II. Seven different oligosaccharides (labeled A to G) were identified in the negative modes. MS-MS spectra showed that they were all characterized by an intense ion at m/z 97, attributable to the formation of HSO4 groups during fragmentation, which demonstrated that all oligosaccharides were sulfated. All of the compounds were detected as [M - H]- adducts in ES/MS and ES/MS-MS negative mode because of the sulfate negative charge.Fig. 2ES/MS profiling of ethanol-soluble oligosaccharides from purified glyconectins.

Open table in a new tab Compounds B, C, and G have sequences that are related. The observation of an intense [(SO3)HexNAc-H2O] ion at m/z 282 in their fragmentation spectra permitted the localization of the sulfate group to the GlcNAc residue in these three compounds. The smallest oligosaccharide, B, showed a very simple fragmentation pattern characterized by a parent ion at m/z 446 (native) or 448 (reduced) and a B-type ion [M-dHex] or [M-dHex-ol] at m/z 282. This demonstrated unequivocally that the Fuc residue was in the terminal reducing position, which characterized compound B as the dimer (SO3)GlcNAc-Fuc. Compound C was typified by the occurrence of a Fuc residue at both the reducing and the nonreducing ends, as established by the presence of [M-dHex] Y-type ions at m/z 445.5 and 447.8 for unreduced and reduced oligosaccharides, respectively, and secondary ions [M-dHex-dHex] and [M-dHex-dHex-ol] at m/z 282 for both the reduced and unreduced oligosaccharides (Fig. 3). Thus, the sequence of compound C was established as either Fuc-(SO3)GlcNAc-Fuc or (SO3)GlcNAc-[Fuc]Fuc. The fragmentation pattern of compound G was characterized by the simultaneous presence of the Y-type ions [M-HexNAc] at m/z 592/594 and the B-type ion [M-dHex/dHex-ol] at m/z 629. On this basis, compound G was described as an extension of the linear isomer of compound C with an additional GlcNAc residue in the terminal nonreducing position. In this case, and contrary to compound C, the absence of [M-dHex] fragment excluded the possibility of a branched structure with a terminal nonreducing Fuc residue and demonstrated the presence of a single linear isomer. Compounds D, E, and F differed from the previous compounds by the sulfation position on a hexose residue as indicated by the ubiquitous presence of the [(SO3)Hex-H2O] ion at m/z 241. The sequence of compound D was established as GlcNAc-(SO3)Gal-Fuc due to the presence of [M-dHexol] B ion and [M-HexNAc] Y ion at m/z 444 and 407, respectively. The presence of branched isomer could be excluded because this sequence would not be able to generate the characteristic fragment with mass of 444. Similarly, for compound E, [M-HexNAc-ol] B and C ions at m/z 403 and 421 demonstrated the presence of a GlcNAc residue in the terminal reducing position. The occurrence of the Y ion [M-Hex] at m/z 464 established the sequence as Gal-(SO3)Gal-GlcNAc. Finally, compound F appears to be an extension of compound E with a Fuc residue in the terminal reducing position, as demonstrated by the [M-dHexol] C ion at m/z 606. The simultaneous presence of [M-Hex], [M-dHexol-HexNAc] and [M-dHexol-Hex] at m/z 610, 403, and 444, respectively, confirmed the proposed sequence. As in the case of structures D and E, structure F cannot exist as the alternative branched isomer. In addition, the absence of (M-HexNAc) and (M-HexNAc-Hex) fragments confirmed the internal positioning of the HexNAc residue within the proposed sequence. These results are in agreement with previously published data on the structure of GN1 glyconectin (12Spillmann D. Thomas-Oates J.E. van Kuik J.A. Vliegenthart J.F. Misevic G. Burger M.M. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5089-5097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In particular, two oligosaccharides with sequences SO3(3)GlcNAc(β1-3)Fuc and Gal(α1-2)[SO3(3)]Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc(β1-3)Fuc matched perfectly with compounds B and F. Importantly, three new motifs were discovered, namely the sequences GlcNAc-(SO3)Gal-Fuc, (SO3)GlcNAc-[Fuc]Fuc, and GlcNAc-Fuc-(SO3) GlcNAc-Fuc. The latter originated from the incomplete hydrolysis of Fuc-labile linkages. Electrospray analysis in positive mode of the same fraction showed only a few components that could not be sequenced in ES/MS because of low quantities. In particular, a minor ion at m/z 622 was observed. Its calculated composition (1 PyGal, 1 HexNAc, and 1 dHex) matches the acid-labile trisaccharide Py(4,6)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc(β1-3)Fuc previously described in GN1 (11Spillmann D. Hard K. Thomas-Oates J. Vliegenthart J.F. Misevic G. Burger M.M. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13378-13387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low amounts of Py(4,6)Gal detected in the total oligosaccharidic fraction confirmed that this oligosaccharide was a very minor component. These data suggest that the GN1 acid-labile domain is not composed of a single type of repetitive and short units, as observed in glycosaminoglycans, but rather of more complex and heterogeneous polymeric sequences in which Fuc residues may be substituted by either GlcNAc, (SO3)GlcNAc, or (SO3)Gal and in which (SO3)Gal may be substituted by either Gal or GlcNAc residues. The GN1 polysaccharide therefore presents a novel and highly heterogeneous structure. GN2 Sequencing—Unlike GN1, partial hydrolysis of GN2 by 0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid did not release any small oligosaccharides but a material of greater size, which did not migrate in TLC (Fig. 1). This cleaved fraction contained large quantities of Gal (>40% of the total monosaccharides) and Py(4,6)Gal (>20%), as well as Man, GlcNAc, Fuc, and traces of GalNAc. The fucose content (7%) was much lower than observed in the GN1 hydrolysate (50%). Gel filtration analysis revealed that the released oligosaccharides ranged in size from 15 to 20 Glc degrees of polymerization (not shown). Such large sizes prevented us from determining their exact mass by MS analyses in MALDI-TOF or ES/MS. However, relevant structural data were inferred from other analytical techniques. The nature of the reducing terminal monosaccharides was determined by KaB3H4 labeling and hydrolysis. TLC and HPAEC analyses revealed that only galactose and fucose were converted to polyols (Fig. 4). Tritiated Gal-ol was three times as abundant as Fuc-ol, suggesting that more oligosaccharides originated from the cleavage of galactose linkages than fucose linkages. This was in agreement with the low Fuc and very high Gal content. The size of oligosaccharides released from GN2 and their high proportion of Py(4,6)Gal suggested that each molecule contained more than one of these residues. Thus, the oligosaccharides are either linear, with internal Py(4,6)Gal residues, or branched, with Py(4,6)Gal residues in terminal positions. To discriminate between these possibilities we performed multiple NMR analyses. On the HOHAHA spectrum, we observed a β anomeric signal at δ 4.817 ppm, which correlated with a broad multiplet at δ 3.656-3.696 ppm and with a pseudo singlet at δ 4.155 ppm, which could be attributed, respectively, to H-2/H-3 and to H-"

Large glycoconjugates, which make up the outermost cell surface layer of all Metazoans, are the primary candidates for the primordial adhesion and recognition functions in biological self-assembly systems. Atomic force microscopy experiments demonstrated that the binding strength between a single pair of Porifera cell surface glyconectin 1 glycoconjugates from Microciona prolifera can hold the weight of 1600 cells, proving their adhesion functions. Here, measurement of molecular self-recognition of glyconectins (GNs) purified from three Porifera species was used as an experimental model for primordial xenogeneic self/non-self discrimination. Physicochemical and biochemical characterization of the three glyconectins, their glycans, and peptides using gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, NMR, mass spectrometry, glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzyme treatment, amino acid and carbohydrate analyses, and peptide mapping showed that GNs define a new family of proteoglycan-like molecules exhibiting species-specific structures with complex and repetitive acidic carbohydrate motives different from the classical proteoglycans and mucins. In functional self-assembly color-coded bead, cell, and blotting assays, glyconectins displayed species-specific recognition and adhesion. Affinity-purified monospecific polyclonal antibodies prepared against GN1, -2, and -3 glycans selectively inhibited cell adhesion of the respective sponge species. These results together with species-specific coaggregation of GN carbohydrate-coated beads with cells showed that GN glycans are functional in cell recognition and adhesion. The specificity of carbohydrate-mediated homophilic GN interactions in Porifera approaches the binding selectivity of the evolutionarily advanced immunoglobulin superfamily. Xenoselectivity of primordial glyconectin to glyconectin recognition may be a new paradigm in the self-assembly and non-self discrimination pathway of cellular adhesion leading to multicellularity.

Xenoselectivity of primordial glyconectin to glyconectin recognition may be a new paradigm in the self-assembly and non-self discrimination pathway of cellular adhesion leading to multicellularity. The emergence of multicellularity required the simultaneous development of cell adhesion and recognition properties. In addressing the unresolved question of what may have been the molecular basis for primordial self-recognition and non-self-discrimination we focused our attention on the role of proteoglycan-like glyconectins in Porifera xenogeneic cellular interactions, as the evolutionary most compatible model system for ancestors of Metazoans. Electron microscopic, x-ray diffraction, and biochemical analyses showed that large glycoconjugates such as glyconectins, classical type proteoglycans and mucins, are the largest multi-million molecular weight macromolecules, extending at least 10 times further from the cell surface than any other cell adhesion glycoprotein (1Dammer U. Popescu O. Wagner P. Anselmetti D. Guntherodt H.J. Misevic G.N. Science. 1995; 267: 1173-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 2Dwek R.A. Chem.

Based on this evidence, here we put forward the hypothesis that Porifera glyconectins, as the most peripheral cell surface environment sensors, may have provided the initial key recognition and adhesion functions during the emergence of Metazoan ancestors. This would imply that Porifera, as the simplest Metazoans alive today, should have preserved, at least in part, a glyconectin adhesion and recognition mechanism to guide the initial phase of xenogeneic selectivity of cellular interactions. In fact, in recent atomic force microscopy experiments we demonstrated with purified molecules that the strength of glyconectin 1 to glyconectin 1 binding is fundamental in the cohesion between the cells of the sponge Microciona prolifera, ascribed to these molecules in previous functional investigations (4Moscona A.A.

To examine whether homophilic glyconectin to glyconectin binding was also involved in primordial cellular adhesion and recognition self-assembly processes associated with the emergence of multicellularity, we studied the molecular basis of specific xenogeneic cell interactions in the phylum Porifera. Early work from the beginning of the 20th century on dissociated marine sponge cells provided important phenomenological evidence for cell sorting (4Moscona A.A. Dev.

However, these and subsequent experiments from 1960 to 1980 used semi-purified and chemically ill-defined extracts, termed aggregation factors, and thus lacked quantitative and biochemical data about the underlying molecular mechanisms (9Cauldwell C.B.

In the last two decades, the first structure-to-function-related studies have been performed on M. prolifera glyconectins (1Dammer U. Popescu O. Wagner P. Anselmetti D. Guntherodt H.J. Misevic G.N.

Here, we have isolated glyconectins (GNs) from three marine sponge species, M. prolifera (GN1), Halichondria panicea (GN2), and Cliona celata (GN3). Physicochemical analyses and mass spectrometric fingerprinting of the three purified glyconectin macromolecules revealed species-specific proteoglycan-like structures that define a new class of glycocojugates. Using a quantitative functional approach with color-coded beads, cells, and blotting, we have shown that highly specific cell surface glyconectin to glyconectin interactions indeed mediate cell recognition and adhesion in the three Porifera species. Specific inhibition of cell adhesion by three monospecific anti-GN carbohydrate polyclonal antibodies, together with species-selective coaggregation of GN carbohydrate-coated beads with cells showed that GN glycans from the three sponge species are functional in cell recognition and adhesion. Thus, this study establishes a new paradigm for the pivotal role of primordial glyconectin carbohydrates in the self-assembly and non-self discrimination pathway of cellular adhesion prior to the evolution of multicellularity. Isolation of Glyconectin Proteoglycans—Glyconectins were extracted from fresh cuts of sponges with artificial Ca2+- and Mg2+-free seawater (ACMFSW; 1The abbreviations used are: ACMFSW, artificial Ca2+- and Mg2+-free seawater; SWT, seawater-Tris; CSW, Ca2+- and Mg2+-free seawater buffered with Tris; GC/MS, gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry; GN, glyconectin; EI-MS, electronic impact mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Py(4,6)Gal, 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-α-d-Galp; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 462 mm NaCl, 10.7 mm KCl, 7 mm Na2SO4, and 2.1 mm NaHCO3) at +4 °C for 12 h. Glyconectins were purified by sequential centrifugation, 20 mm CaCl2 precipitation, and ultracentrifugation (14Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ultracentrifugation Analysis—Molecular weight and sedimentation coefficient of sponge glyconectins were determined by sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity analyses in seawater-Tris (SWT; 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) at +20 °C using a Beckman Model E analytical Ultracentrifuge according to procedures described previously (14Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agarose Electrophoresis—Electrophoretic separation of sponge glyconectins was performed on a 0.75% agarose gel in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.3, for 2 h at 100 V and 4 °C (13Popescu O. Misevic G.N. Nature. 1997; 386: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with 0.02% toluidine blue in 3% acetic acid followed by 0.1% Amido Black 10B in 3% acetic acid. Peptide Mapping of Glyconectins—GN1, GN2, and GN3 were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with acrylamide in the presence of SDS 1%, 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.4 (19Brune D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and then digested by trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 30 °C for 12 h. Salts were removed on ZipTip C18 (Millipore) and peptides analyze by mass spectrometry. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on a “Voyager DE STR” time-of-flight instrument (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 337-nm UV laser. The mass spectra were acquired in reflectron mode with positive detection and with 20 kV accelerating voltage. Aliquots (0.5 μl) of the elution solution were mixed with an equal volume of the matrix solution, α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (10 mg/ml dissolved in acetonitrile-water, 50/50 by volume). External calibration was performed using a peptide mix: des-Arg-bradykinin (904.4681 kD), angiotensin I (1296.6853 kD), Glu-fibrinopeptide B (1570.6774 kD), ACTH(clip 1-17) (2,093.0867 kD), and ACTH(clip 18-39) (2,465.1989 kD). Purification of Glyconectin Glycans—Purified glyconectins were precipitated with 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. The glyconectin pellet was resuspended again in 70% ethanol, and centrifugation was repeated. Finally glyconectins were precipitated with a water/chloroform/methanol (1/1/3 by volume) mixture and dried under a N2 stream. Pronase (type E from Merck) was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, 1 mm CaCl2 at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and preincubated for 20 min at 60 °C. Subsequently 1 ml of preincubated pronase (1 mg/ml) was added to 20 mg of dried glyconectin pellet and incubated for 12 h at 60 °C. This proteolysis digestion procedure was repeated twice by adding fresh aliquots of preincibated pronase. Released glycans were separated from free amino acids, salts, and small peptides by gel filtration and subsequent ion exchange chromatography. Preparation of Monospecific Polyclonal Antibodies against Glyconectin Carbohydrates—Purified glyconectin carbohydrates were used for preparation of polyclonal antibodies according to the procedure described previously (14Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monospecific polyclonal antibodies were obtained by affinity purification on GN glycans cross-linked to a solid matrix using previously a reported methodology of immobilization (13Popescu O. Misevic G.N. Nature. 1997; 386: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoglobulins bound to GNs were eluted with 1 m NaCl and subsequently dialyzed against CSW (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free seawater buffered with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The monospecificity of these isolated anti-GN carbohydrate antibodies to their respective glycan antigens was confirmed in immunodot assay (14Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide Electrophoresis—Electrophoretic separation of purified glyconectin glycans was performed on a polyacrylamide gradient gel (7.5-15%) at 350 V in 0.09 m Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2.4 mm EDTA (15Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Misevic G.N. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with 0.3% alcian blue in 3% acetic acid and 25% isopropanol solution. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry of Oligosaccharides—The molecular mass of the oligosaccharides was measured by MALDI-TOF MS on a Vision 2000 time-of-flight instrument (Finnigan Mat) equipped with a 337 nm UV laser. 1 μl of sample at a concentration of 100 pmol/μl was mixed with an equal volume of matrix and allowed to crystallize. We used 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 3-aminoquinoline for the neutral and acidic oligosaccharides, respectively. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—All measurements were carried out in positive-ion mode on a triple quadrupole instrument (Micromass Ltd., Altrincham, UK) fitted with an atmospheric pressure ionization electrospray source. A mixture of polypropylene glycol was used to calibrate the quadrupole mass spectrometer. Underivated oligosaccharides were dissolved in methanol/water (50/50) and permethylated oligosaccharides in acetonitrile at a concentration of 10 pmol/μl. Samples were infused using the nanoflow probe at 50 nl/min. Quadrupole was scanned from 200 to 2000 Da with a scan duration of 3 s and a scan delay of 0.1 s. The samples were sprayed using 1.4-kV needle voltage, and the declustering (cone) was typically set at 70 V. For collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments, the pressure of argon in the cell was set at 4 × 10-3 millibar and the collision energy was set to values ranging from 25 to 75 eV. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR experiments were performed on Bruker® ASX400 and DMX600 spectrometers, both equipped with a 5-mm 1H/13C mixed probe-head operating in the pulse Fourier transform mode and controlled by an Aspect 3000 computer. Each glyconectin sample was dissolved in 400 μl of 2H2O after three exchanges with 2H2O (99.97% atom 2H, Euriso-top, CEA group, Gif-sur-Yvette France) and intermediate lyophilizations. The glyconectins were analyzed at 300 K. The chemical shifts (δ) were referenced to internal acetone (δ1H = 2.225 and δ13C = 31.55 ppm under the conditions used). Two-dimensional homonuclear (COSY90, TOCSY) and heteronuclear (HMQC) experiments were performed by using standard Bruker® pulse programs. The main pulses and variable delays were optimized for each pulse program and sample. Gas Chromatography—Monosaccharides were analyzed by GC/MS as per-trimethylsilyl (21Kamerling J.P. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and per-heptafluorobutyryl derivatives (22Zanetta J.P. Timmerman P. Leroy Y. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Methylation of oligosaccharides was conducted according to Ciucanu and Kerek (23Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar) before analysis on GC/MS. Other Analytical Methods—The size of the oligosaccharides was assessed by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P2 or P4 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 0.5% acetic acid and calibrated with hydrolyzed dextran in combination with thin layer chromatography as already described. Amino acid composition was assessed by Pico-Tag HPLC and SO42- content by Dionex high pH anion-exchange chromatography, both after 6 m HCl hydrolysis at 100 °C for 12 h. Preparation of Cells and Glyconectin-coated Beads—Sponge cells were dissociated and washed in ACMFSW at 0 °C. In some experiments cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde (14Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A volume of 200 μl of 2% latex-amidine bead suspension, 0.6 μm in diameter (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), was washed three times with 1 ml of SWT by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. Beads were resuspended in 200 μl of SWT and bath-sonicated for 5 min. To allow adsorption to beads on the basis of charge, 100 μg of either glyconectins or glycans isolated from these glyconectins was added to a 100 μl of bead suspension that was then incubated at 22 °C for 15 min followed by three washes as described above. The glyconectin-coated beads were resuspended in 100 μl of SWT. Because the diameter of the beads is 600 nm and the size of glyconectins are in the same range, each bead bound at least 1 molecule of glyconectin and about 20-50 large glycan molecules. Recognition, Adhesion, and Overlay Assays with Cells and Beads—Cell-cell adhesion assays were performed with 106 cells bearing surface glyconectins in 100 μl of ACMFSW, without or with 10 mm Ca2+, in the presence or absence of anti-GN-glycan polyclonal antibodies. For glutaraldehyde-fixed cells assays were done in SWT with or without Ca2+. For the cell-bead assay, 5-10 μl of 2% bead suspension in SWT was added to 100 μl of cell suspension containing 106 cells in the presence or absence of 10 mm Ca2+. In bead overlay assays 50-100 μl of 2% bead suspension in SWT was added to nitrocellulose membrane or agarose gel equilibrated in 1 ml of CSW in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+. The degree of cell-cell and bead-bead adhesion in the presence of variable calcium or magnesium ion concentrations or anti-GN-glycan polyclonal antibodies was quantified after a 20-min rotation either by counting single cells and aggregates of at least 40 μm in diameter or by spectrophotometrically measuring the absorbance of supernatants after sedimentation at 100 × g for 1 min. Purification and Physical Characterization of Glyconectins of Three Sponge Species—GNs were purified by CaCl2 precipitation and sequential ultracentrifugation of isotonic Ca2+-free seawater extracts from three different marine sponge species, M. prolifera (GN1), H. panicea (GN2), and C. celata (GN3). This procedure is similar to the one we originally used for M. prolifera and is thus different from guanidinium hydrochloride or urea extraction techniques applied for classical mammalian proteoglycans (24Hassell J.R.

Analytical ultracentrifugation and agarose electrophoresis of isolated glyconectins showed that each species expressed a unique type of multi-million macromolecule with sedimentation greater then 40 S composed of one or few highly negatively charged glycosylated subunits (Table I and Fig. 1).Table IPhysicochemical properties of sponge glyconectinsGN1GN2GN3Mr × 10619108s20,w (S)584246Carbohydrate/protein ratio (w/w)63/3721/7936/64Monosaccharides (mol %)Ara0011Fuc28731Man91620Gal294312GalNAc117GlcNAc171413Py(4,6)Gal4160GlcA1136Amino acids (mol %)Asx9.17.811.1Glx10.49.29.5Ser6.77.011.3Gly9.09.910.9Arg5.67.66.0Thr9.910.214.1Ala7.17.07.7Pro7.38.210.7Tyr2.84.00.7Val9.28.66.1Met2.42.52.4Cys0.10.10.2Ile5.46.03.9Leu7.85.55.1Phe5.14.83.6Lys0.20.20.1SO42- (mol/mol)820620700 Open table in a new tab Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Compositional Analysis of Native Glyconectins—The three purified native glyconectins were analyzed for their sugar compositions by gas chromatography (Table I). Common monosaccharides, Fuc, Ara, Man, Gal, GlcNAc, GalNAc, GlcA, and a single type of pyruvated hexose were found in various amounts. Pyruvated hexose was at first visualized by gas chromatography as methyl-glycoside heptafluoryl derivative as two peaks tentatively attributed to its α and β anomers. This structure was confirmed as a pyruvated hexose in methyl-glycoside heptafluoryl derivative because of a [M + NH4] ion at m/z 698 in chemical ionization mass spectrometry and a very intense [M - COOMe] ion at m/z 611 in EI-MS (Fig. 2) (27Dudman W.F. Lacey M.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 145: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The exact nature of this residue was established as 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-α-d-Galp (Py(4,6)Gal) by trimethylsilyl derivatization of methylglycoside and comparison with standard EI-MS spectra from the literature (Fig. 2) (27Dudman W.F. Lacey M.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 145: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Indeed, spectra was dominated by an ion at m/z 243, characteristic of a 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-d-galactose structure (27Dudman W.F. Lacey M.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 145: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and by an intense [M - COOMe] at m/z 363. The intense ion at m/z 204, resulting from the cleavage of two adjacent trimethylsilyl groups, also characterized the 4,6-linkage position of the pyruvate group. Subsequently, this attribution was confirmed by NMR experiments of glyconectin hydrolysis fragments from GN2 (see accompanying article (40Guerardel Y. Czeszak X. Sumanovski L. Karamanos Y. Popescu O.

This is in agreement with previous work that identified a Py(4,6)Gal-containing oligosaccharide obtained by hydrolysis of glyconectin from M. prolifera (28Spillmann D. Hard K. Thomas-Oates J.

The stability of the 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-galactose pyranose ring to methanolysis (27Dudman W.F. Lacey M.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 145: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) enabled us to estimate, among the other monosaccharides, the amount of this particular component in each sample (Table I). As shown in Table I, glyconectins from the three analyzed species showed differences regarding their sugar compositions. GN1 was characterized by a high quantity of fucose (about one-third of the total monosaccharide content) and minute amounts of Py(4,6)Gal, whereas GN2 was characterized by a lower proportion of fucose and a molar ratio of Py(4,6)Gal four times higher than GN1. On the other hand, GN3 was the only one to contain arabinose (11 mol %) as well as high quantities of fucose but no Py(4,6)Gal at all. This last species was also the only one to exhibit significant amounts (>5%) of GalNAc. Amino acid analysis of three sponge glyconectins showed species-specific differences with some common features such as the presence of over 7% serine, threonine, and asparagine/aspartic acid (Table I). Peptide Mapping of Native Glyconectins—Native GN1, GN2, and GN3 were reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with acrylamide in the presence of SDS, and subsequently treated with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All three glyconectins had different peptide maps, indicating distinct core structures and species-specific sequences (Fig. 3). Detailed analyses of MS spectra showed that GN1 has 67, GN2 84, and GN3 44 peptides. A comparison of GN1, GN2, and GN3 tryptic fragment masses revealed 10 peptides with the same mass. Whether these peptides are identical would have to be verified by direct sequencing. Furthermore, the cloning and sequencing of GN2 and GN3 genes for their respective core proteins will show the exact differences to the already cloned gene of GN1 (16Fernandez-Busquets X.

Purification and Biochemical Analyses of Glyconectin Glycans—Purified glyconectins GN1, -2, and -3 were extensively treated with pronase, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” to digest the protein part. After removal of small peptides and amino acids by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography, glycans of GN1, -2, and -3 were analyzed for their monosaccharide and amino acid contents (Table II). Monosaccharide analysis of the total GN glycans showed a composition almost identical to the native GNs, with the exception of GN3, where the ratio of fucose and GlcNAc were different. Recovery of total carbohydrates was more than 90%. These data indicated that there was neither selective nor quantitatively significant loss of carbohydrates during pronase treatment. Amino acid analyses showed that glycans are essentially free of protein excluding the linkage and their neighboring amino acids (Table II). Sulfate analyzes of the three GN total glycan fractions revealed over 90% recovery from the intact GNs.Table IIMonosaccharide composition of GN glycansGN1 glycansGN2 glycansGN3 glycansmol %mol %mol %Monosaccharides (mol %)Ara007Fuc21518Man61313Gal303716GalNAc208GlcNAc231532Py(4,6)Gal8260GlcA1046Amino acids (mol %)Asx393335Glx222025Ser91213Gly151613Arg001Thr101210Ala231Pro000Tyr000Val001Met000Cys000Ile000Leu231Phe110Lys000Monosaccharide/amino acid ratio (mol %)97/394/695/5SO42- (moles recovered from intact GN)750600650 Open table in a new tab A study of glyconectin glycan heterogeneity after pronase treatment was performed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4).

Organisms inhabiting aerobic environments unavoidably encounter the downside effect of oxygen. That is, inadequate metabolic reduction of molecular oxygen to water results in the production of reactive oxygen species, including the superoxide anion radical ( O2.¯), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (OH·). Furthermore, these species are able to react with other cellular components causing damage and/or generating oxidizing derivatives such as alkylhydroperoxides. The fastidious organism Haemophilus influenzae, etiological agent of inflictions such as meningitis and otitis media, not only has to endure oxidative stress resulting from its own aerobic metabolism, but together with macrophages in which it may reside (1Craig J.E. Cliffe A. Garnett K. High N.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 55-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neighboring strains of peroxidogenic Streptococci (2Pericone C.D. Overweg K. Hermans P.W. Weiser J.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3990-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) also add in the continuous exposure of the bacterium to reactive oxygen species. Recently, we reported the initial characterization of H. influenzae Rd PGdx 1The abbreviations used are: PGdx, chimeric peroxiredoxin/glutaredoxin peroxidase; t-BOOH, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; COOH, cumene hydroperoxide; BHI, brain-heart infusion; sBHI, supplemented brain-heart infusion; Camr, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase resistance gene.

Previously, we have also shown that glutathione and the only catalase, HktE, provide overlapping protection in H. influenzae Rd against respiratory-generated H2O2 (6Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this GSH-based mitigation of H2O2 is mainly attributable to PGdx, we constructed a knock-out in the pgdx gene. Physiological studies, including growth assays and pro-oxidant sensitivity assays, allow us to conclude that PGdx acts as a major antioxidant in vivo. We also show that PGdx plays an essential role during stationary-phase growth of the bacterium, as observed in overnight grown aerobic cultures. Materials—Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA purification from gel or solution was carried out using either the Qiaquick DNA Extraction or PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Ligations were performed using T4 DNA ligase (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA was prepared by the alkaline lysis method on either a small scale (7Birnboim H. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9906) Google Scholar) or a 30-ml scale using the Qiagen plasmid purification kit. H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), cumene hydroperoxide (COOH), methyl viologen and bovine liver catalase were obtained from Sigma. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli MC1061 and TOP10 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) were used as hosts for cloning. All E. coli strains were cultured at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium on an orbital shaker rotating at 200 rpm. When appropriate, 100 μg of carbenicillin, 25 μg of chloramphenicol, or 25 μg of kanamycin were added per ml of E. coli culture media. H. influenzae Rd (KW20) was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA; number 51907). H. influenzae Rd was grown at 37 °C under a 3% CO2 atmosphere (candle extinction jar method) on an orbital shaker rotating at 180 rpm (unless otherwise stated). H. influenzae Rd medium consisted of brain-heart infusion (BHI) liquid (Difco) supplemented with β-NAD and hemin (Fluka, Glossop, UK). When appropriate, 2 μg of chloramphenicol or 7 μg of kanamycin were added per ml of H. influenzae Rd media. Solid media for all strains were prepared by adding agar to the liquid media to a final concentration of 1.8%.

Chandler M.S. Redfield R.J. Tomb J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 321-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)) using Expand Long Template DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and the following primers: forward primer (5′-CGC GGA TCC TGC CTG AAC TTT CGC GTA ATA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CGC GGA TCC TGT TTG ATT TGG CGG ATG TA-3′), both containing a BamHI (underlined) restriction site. The obtained PCR product was purified and cloned into the TOPO-XL vector (Invitrogen), generating plasmid pSG4.0. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Camr) gene was amplified from pACYC184 (New England Biolabs) together with its native constitutively expressed promoter using AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), the forward primer 5′-AAC TGC AGT AGA CAG CAC CTC AAA AAC ACC ATC ATA CAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAT ACG TAG TCT ACC AGG CGT TTA AGG GCA CCA ATA ACT-3′. Both primers contain an AccI (underlined) restriction site. The amplified resistance gene was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) prior to digestion with AccI. The digested fragment was inserted into the AccI digested construct pSG4.0, yielding plasmid pSGKO in which the pgdx gene was disrupted by the Camr gene. The pgdx::Camr cassette was amplified by PCR from pSGKO and used to replace the functional pgdx gene by homologous recombination (transformation of H. influenzae Rd was performed as described elsewhere (8Barcak G.J. Chandler M.S. Redfield R.J. Tomb J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 321-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and positive transformants were scored by chloramphenicol resistance). Functional Complementation—Functional complementation of pgdx was accomplished as follows. A fragment containing the complete pgdx gene and its upstream and downstream region was generated by PCR and the following primers: forward primer (5′-CAA CGT TGA CCA ATT GTT CTA ATA ATT GAT GC-3′) containing a HincII restriction site (underlined), reverse primer (5′-AAA ACT GCA GCA ATT GCG TTA TAT GG-3′) containing a PstI restriction site (underlined). After digestion with both HincII and PstI, the fragment was ligated into a HincII/PstI linearized pACYC177 (New England Biolabs) vector producing the complementation vector pCOMP. This complementation vector was transformed into a pgdx mutant of H. influenzae Rd, and positive transformants were selected by kanamycin resistance. Southern Blot Analysis—Purified H. influenzae Rd chromosomal DNA was overnight digested with MfeI and ScaI and subjected to agarose gel (w/v 1%) electrophoresis. The DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose paper and probed by Southern blot analysis as previously described by Ref. 9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out according to the method described by Laemmli (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as described elsewhere (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.46Google Scholar), using rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium; 1/200 dilution) raised against recombinant PGdx protein (obtained as previously described (3Pauwels F. Vergauwen B. Vanrobaeys F. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16658-16666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). Western blots were developed using alkaline phosphatase coupled goat antimouse antibody (Novagen, Madisson, WI; 1/5,000 dilution) and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate chromogenic substrate (Roche Applied Science). Disk Diffusion Assay—Standing overnight grown cultures were diluted 1:20 in freshly prepared supplemented BHI (sBHI) medium without antibiotics and incubated without shaking at 37 °C up to the mid-exponential phase. Cells were confluently plated onto sBHI plates containing no antibiotics using a sterile swab. In the center, a paper disk (diameter 5 mm, Whatman) was placed containing either 3% H2O2, 7% t-BOOH, 10% COOH, or 5 mm methyl viologen. Inhibition zone diameters were measured after incubating the plates for 48 h under a 3% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Growth Curves—Aerobic cultures were diluted 1:20 from standing overnight grown precultures in loosely capped culture tubes that fit tightly into the cuvette holder of a Shimadzu 1240 Mini Single-beam UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) and were then incubated at 37 °C on a shaker rotating at 180 rpm. Absorbance at 600 nm was measured at regular intervals over a period of 8.5 h. At the early exponential phase (A600 0.25), cultures were stressed with different concentrations of hydroperoxides. The percent ratio growth rate of the treated samples to the untreated sample was calculated from these growth curves. For anaerobic experiments, cultures were prepared in a Coy chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc.) under an atmosphere of 85% N2/10% H2/5% CO2. Culture tubes were closed with a silicone stopper prior the removal from the Coy chamber to preserve anaerobiosis during incubation. Determination of H2O2 Scavenging Activity—H2O2 scavenging activity in whole-cells was either measured in the presence of low concentrations (1.2 μm) or high concentrations (20 mm) of H2O2. For low concentrations H. influenzae Rd strains were grown aerobically to an A600 of 0.15. Cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, washed twice, and resuspended in 1 ml of room temperature phosphate-buffered saline at an A600 of 0.15. H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 1.2 μm. Reactions were terminated at regular intervals by removing cells using a Millex-GV13 0.22-μm pore size filter unit (Millipore Products Division, Bedford, MA). Remaining H2O2 in solution was assayed using the Amplex Red Catalase Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For the experiments with high concentrations of H2O2 cells were grown aerobically, pelleted during different stages of growth, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at an A600 of 0.14. H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 20 mm and the decrease in absorbance was monitored at 240 nm (ϵ240 43.6 m–1cm–1). Catalase Activity Staining—Cell extracts of aerobically grown mid-exponential phase wild-type and mutant strains (15 μg) were electrophoretically separated on a native polyacrylamide gel. Catalase activity was measured, using a ferricyanide-negative stain, as follows: the gel was soaked in 0.003% H2O2 for 15 min, rinsed with distilled H2O, and stained with a 50:50 solution of 2% K3Fe(CN)6 and 2% FeCl3·6H2O. Construction of a Mutant Deficient in PGdx Expression—To investigate the in vivo relevance of PGdx as an antioxidant enzyme, we made a pgdx mutant utilizing the integrative disruption method (Fig. 1A). A 4.0-kb subgenomic fragment, encompassing the gene for pgdx (HI0572) and a 1.4-kb upstream and 2.0-kb downstream region, was generated by PCR from H. influenzae Rd chromosomal DNA. The amplified and AccI-digested chloramphenicol resistance cassette (Camr) from pACYC184 was ligated into a unique AccI site within the pgdx gene. The resulting pgdx::Camr knock-out fragment was reintroduced into the chromosome of H. influenzae Rd by transformation and homologous recombination. Disruption of the chromosomal pgdx gene was confirmed by PCR (Fig. 1B; the mutant amplicon was enlarged with around 1,000 base pairs of the antibiotic resistance cassette) as well as by Southern hybridization (Fig. 2 A; probes used for Southern hybridization are depicted in Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis with mouse polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant PGdx confirmed the absence of peroxidase protein in mutant whole cell extracts (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Southern blot and Western blot analysis of PGdx-deficient mutant. A, chromosomal DNA preparations from wild-type and PGdx-deficient H. influenzae Rd were digested with MfeI and ScaI, resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and probed with either a 300-bp product derived from the Peroxiredoxin-domain (Probe A) or a 300-bp product derived from the glutaredoxin-domain (Probe B) (see also Fig. 1A). Size markers are indicated on the left. Theoretical sizes for Probe A: wild-type, 1,427-bp; mutant, 1,645-bp and for Probe B: wild-type, 1,427 bp; mutant, 760 bp.

As such, no dissimilarities were recorded when plotting the data of the growth curve (data not shown). The sensitivity of the H. influenzae Rd pgdx mutant to various pro-oxidants was examined by disk diffusion (Fig. 3A) and liquid culture assays (Fig. 3, B–D). Compared with the wild-type strain the mutant displayed enhanced sensitivity to t-BOOH and COOH, with inhibition zone differences ranging from 12 to 13%, respectively. When stressed in liquid culture with increasing concentrations of hydroperoxides, such as t-BOOH and COOH, we observed the expected, more rapid decline in growth rates in the case of the pgdx mutant (Fig. 3, C and D). In both assays, resistance against the organic hydroperoxides was restored in a strain complemented in trans with a copy of the intact pgdx gene (Fig. 3, A–D; replication of the complementing plasmid and expression of PGdx in the complemented strain was confirmed; results not shown). However, above observations are not akin for H2O2. Here, the mutant shows more resilience than the wild-type or the complemented strain in both the disk diffusion assays and the liquid culture assays (Fig. 3B). In the case of methyl viologen, an indirect inducer of H2O2 (11Farr S.B. Kogoma T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 561-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed similar results (Fig. 3A). Up-regulation of H2O2 Scavenging Activity in pgdx Mutant—To resolve this inconsistency we measured the total H2O2-scavenging activity of aerobically grown cells. As indicated in Fig. 4A, wild-type and mutant show similar patterns, i.e. a moderate increase in H2O2 reducing power during the exponential phase followed by an attenuation when entering the stationary phase. However, when comparing absolute activities, the PGdx-deficient mutant exhibited around 2 orders of magnitude higher H2O2 detoxification throughout growth compared with the wild-type strain. The complemented strain had its activity restored to wild-type levels (Fig. 4A). To determine whether at low micromolar concentrations mutant cells continue to turn over H2O2 more efficiently compared with its wild-type counterpart, we analyzed scavenging activities at 1.2 μm H2O2. These results reflect the ones when high concentrations were assayed (Fig. 4B). The up-regulation of scavenging activity in the mutant most probably results from an increase in catalase activity. To assess this premise, cell extracts of exponential-phase cultures were resolved by native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was subsequently stained for catalase activity using a ferricyanide-negative stain. In the case of the mutant, we observed a higher in-gel activity derived from the catalase HktE (Fig. 5). PGdx Is Essential for Stationary Survival—Much to our surprise, we found that when streaked onto a plate, aerobic cultures of the pgdx mutant exhibited no or barely detectable growth after 12 h of stationary phase while the anaerobically grown culture did (Fig. 6A and Table II). The wild-type parent and complemented mutant showed a moderate decrease in plating efficiency overnight in liquid culture. In contrast, the pgdx mutant rapidly lost viability within hours (Fig. 6B).Table IIGrowth characteristics on plate of stationary-phase culturesStrainGrowth of aerobically grown stationary-phase cultureGrowth of aerobically grown stationary-phase cultureWith catalaseWithout catalaseRd KW20+++Rd KW20 Δpgdx+No or barely distinguishable growth+Rd KW20 cΔpgdxNDaNot determined.++a Not determined. Open table in a new tab This aerobic growth defect in the mutant was restored in the complemented strain (Fig. 6, A and B) or with the addition of catalase during the mid-exponential phase and the early stationary phase (Fig. 6A and Table II). The chimeric enzyme peroxiredoxin/glutaredoxin, or PGdx, from H. influenzae Rd constitutes a recently characterized glutathione-based removal system that reduces H2O2 as well as alkylhydroperoxides at significant rates (3Pauwels F. Vergauwen B. Vanrobaeys F. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16658-16666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on former work on the involvement of glutathione in oxidative stress, we already found that this low molecular weight thiol, when omitted from the growth medium, (i) has no effect on the growth rate of H. influenzae, (ii) increases the sensitivity of the bacterium for alkylhydroperoxides while decreasing it for H2O2, and (iii) induces a doubling in catalase activity (12Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Vaneechoutte M. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition we demonstrated that glutathione-based scavenging is crucial for metabolizing endogenously generated H2O2, since it complements for the absence of a functional catalase (6Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hence, from these data and from kinetic parameters (3Pauwels F. Vergauwen B. Vanrobaeys F. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16658-16666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it was inferred that H. influenzae PGdx, in analogy with the NAD(P)H-dependent peroxidase Ahp from E. coli (13Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), fulfils a role as major peroxidase for low concentrations of H2O2. To assess the quantitative importance of this antioxidant enzyme against hydroperoxides, we constructed a H. influenzae Rd knock-out in the PGdx encoding gene HI0572 and studied its effect. Characterization of the pgdx Mutant—No differences in growth rate between the pgdx mutant and its wild-type parent were observed, both under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. This confirms the apparent redundancy of GSH-based scavenging during logarithmic growth. However, as will be discussed below, the absence of PGdx is actually compensated for, thus concealing the loss in antioxidant capacity. Our results also demonstrate that H. influenzae Rd, deficient in PGdx, is considerably hampered in the ability to reduce organic hydroperoxides such as t-BOOH and COOH. Polar effects can be ruled out here because sensitivities are restored when complementing in trans with an intact copy of the disrupted gene. However, comparison of the in vitro measured catalytic efficiencies for t-BOOH (kcat/Km 5.67 × 104 s–1·m–1) and H2O2 (kcat/Km 5.01 × 106 s–1·m–1), in terms of substrate preference, puts alkylhydroperoxides second in line after H2O2 (3Pauwels F. Vergauwen B. Vanrobaeys F. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16658-16666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When H2O2 challenging was tested, the pgdx mutant paradoxically showed higher resistance compared with the wild-type and the complemented strain. However, it was shown here that this resilience is attributed to an alteration in H2O2 scavenging activity on behalf of the mutant strain. Similar phenotypes have already been reported in numerous cases such as E. coli (13Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), Xanthomonas campestris (14Mongkolsuk S. Whangsuk W. Vattanaviboon P. Loprasert S. Fuangthong M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Bacteroides fragilis (15Rocha E.R. Smith C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5701-5710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16Ochsner U.A. Vasil M.L. Alsabagh E. Parvatiyar K. Hasset D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4533-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and Bacillus subtilis (17Bsat N. Chen L. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where disruption of ahp causes an induction of catalase activity to compensate for its loss. Transformation with the functional gene complemented for the variation in resistance, as was also the case for Xanthomonas and Bacillus (14Mongkolsuk S. Whangsuk W. Vattanaviboon P. Loprasert S. Fuangthong M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Bsat N. Chen L. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We can conclude that this response of H. influenzae, inherent to the loss of the enzyme, underscores the importance of PGdx in H2O2 scavenging. Induction of hktE in the Absence of PGdx—At high H2O2 concentrations, whole cells of the pgdx mutant scavenged nearly twice as much H2O2 than its isogenic wild-type strain, which correlates well with the determined HktE activity in GSH-devoid medium (76 ± 13 units/mg protein) compared with GSH-replete medium (36 ± 7 units/mg of protein) (12Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Vaneechoutte M. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At low concentrations the mutant continued to scavenge at a higher rate, again reflecting our previous results when comparing a wild-type Rd strain in GSH-depleted medium with a catalase-deficient hktE mutant in GSH-replete medium (6Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In concert with the results of the catalase activity gel staining we conclude that HktE is indeed the major factor governing the increased H2O2 scavenging. The absence of a functional PGdx is liable to induce the expression of the catalase HktE to compensate for the loss of antioxidant capacity. Activation of OxyR requires endogenous H2O2 concentrations as low as ∼10–7m (18González-Flecha B. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 179: 382-388Crossref Google Scholar). Since both PGdx and HktE (19Bishai W.R. Smith H.O. Barcak G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2914-2921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contain an OxyR-binding consensus sequence in their promoter, deficiency in glutathione-based scavenging by the cell could easily result in the upholding of sufficient H2O2 levels, to low for efficient reduction by HktE but adequate enough for OxyR oxidation and subsequent catalase up-regulation. Moreover, we have shown that glutathione-based scavenging is more effective at scavenging very low concentrations of H2O2 (5Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Jacquemotte F. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Bartsch R.G. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20890-20897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results not only support the foregoing explanation, but also classify H. influenzae PGdx as major antioxidant for low, metabolically generated H2O2. Stationary-phase Dependence of H. influenzae on PGdx— Rather than producing a growth defect during log phase, the presence of a dysfunctional pgdx gene became apparent in the stationary phase. Only in the presence of exogenously added catalase, or when cultured anaerobically, did the PGdx-deficient mutant continue to grow after prolonged stationary growth. Stationary-phase survival is often associated with virulence (20Loewen P.C. Hengge-Aronis R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 53-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent paper from Kraiss et al. (21Kraiss H.M. Hilpert A.K. Schlor S. Reidl J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2003; 293: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) concludes that invasiveness of H. influenzae relies on the ability of the bacterium to grow aerobically. Several reports exist where stationary-phase induction of catalase plays a critical role (e.g. Caulobacter crescentus (22Steinman H.M. Fareed F. Weinstein L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Legionella pneumophila (23Bandyopadhyay P. Steinman H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5369-5374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), B. fragilis (15Rocha E.R. Smith C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5701-5710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). From our observations, however, it seems that PGdx, rather than HktE, provides protection during stationary phase. This is likely because the latter becomes repressed at this point (19Bishai W.R. Smith H.O. Barcak G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2914-2921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and does not play a role in virulence (24Bishai W.R. Howard N.S. Winkelstein J.A. Smith H.O. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4855-4860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While in E. coli aerobic respiration was reported to decrease during stationary phase (18González-Flecha B. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 179: 382-388Crossref Google Scholar), other sources may continue to be an oxidative threat. With antioxidant power in H. influenzae being scarce due to the combined repression of catalase and the deficiency of PGdx, these threats become emphasized in the stationary phase, resulting in cells that succumb. In short, we have demonstrated that, besides reducing organic hydroperoxides, the primary action of PGdx is to scavenge metabolically generated H2O2 as well as to safeguard the cell from oxidative stress during the stationary phase. How exactly PGdx is involved in stationary-phase survival remains to be determined. Therefore, we are currently evaluating the virulence properties of a pathogenic variant of H. influenzae defective in pgdx, as well as the mechanisms behind the regulation of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W2097174950,"tramtrack 69 (TTK69) is known to repress GAGA-mediated activation of the eve promoter in S2 cells. Here, we show that repression by TTK69 occurs in the absence of bona fide TTK69-binding sites on the template, indicating that it does not require the binding of TTK69 to DNA. Consistent with this interpretation, the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69, which does not bind DNA, is sufficient for repression. Moreover, a fusion protein in which the POZ/BTB domain of GAGA is replaced by that of TTK69 is not capable of activating the eve promoter but efficiently represses GAGA-dependent activation. Repression involves GAGA-TTK69 interaction because TTK69 is not capable of repressing basal transcription. Most probably, GAGA-TTK69 interaction occurs at the promoter because GAGA·TTK69 complexes are fully competent in binding DNA in vitro. Our results also show that repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter is not mediated by any of the co-repressors known to interact with TTK69 (dMi2 or C-terminal binding protein) or by trichostatin A-sensitive histone deacetylases. Altogether, these observations strongly suggest that the binding of TTK69 prevents the interaction of GAGA with the transcription machinery and, therefore, compromises its activation potential. tramtrack 69 (TTK69) is known to repress GAGA-mediated activation of the eve promoter in S2 cells.

Many developmentally regulated genes in Drosophila are known to be activated by GAGA (1Wilkins R.C. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3963-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that GAGA acts as a transcription activator in vitro or upon transient transfection in cultured S2 cells (2Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Soeller W.C. Oh C.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, at the preblastoderm stage, TTK acts as a maternally provided repressor of several pair-rule genes that was proposed to contribute to the establishment of the precise timing of their zygotic expression (5Brown J.L. Sonoda S. Ueda H. Scott M.P. Wu C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Brown J.L. Wu C. Development. 1993; 117: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Read D. Levine M. Manley J.L. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TTK is also known to play a critical role in the development of the nervous system by repressing neuronal identity and stabilizing non-neuronal fates (8Xiong W.C. Montell C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Guo M. Bier E. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

GAGA exists as two different splice forms that, differing in the C-terminal glutamine-rich domain, appear to play highly redundant functions in vivo (2Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Greenberg A.J. Schedl P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and have indistinguishable DNA binding, chromatin remodeling, and transcription activities in vitro (2Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The tramtrack gene also encodes two splicing forms, TTK69 and TTK88, which differ in the C-terminal zinc finger region and thus have different DNA binding specificities (13Read D. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The repressing activity of TTK69 is well established. Ectopic expression of TTK69 early in embryo development was shown to cause repression of various pair-rule genes including even-skipped (eve) (6Brown J.L. Wu C. Development. 1993; 117: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Read D. Levine M. Manley J.L. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and overexpression of TTK69 in cultured S2 cells repressed GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of TTK69 during early eye development blocks neuronal photoreceptor differentiation and promotes non-neuronal cone cell specification (15Wen Y. Nguyen D. Li Y. Lai Z.-C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many genes in Drosophila, such as eve, contain at their regulatory regions binding sites for GAGA and TTK, suggesting a coordinated contribution to the regulation of their expression pattern. Actually, as mentioned above, TTK69 represses GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter but not basal transcription (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, the mechanisms of repression by TTK69 of the eve promoter were analyzed in S2 cells. It was shown earlier that repression by TTK69 of the eve promoter involves direct GAGA-TTK69 interaction (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that repression does not require the binding of TTK69 to DNA because it occurs in the absence of TTK69-binding sites on the template and the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69, which does not bind DNA, is sufficient for repression. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the repression activity of TTK69. TTK69 was found to interact both biochemically and genetically with the transcriptional co-repressor dCtBP (15Wen Y. Nguyen D. Li Y. Lai Z.-C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as with the dMi2 subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase or NuRD co-repressor complex (16Murawsky C.M. Brehm A. Badenhorst P. Lowe N. Becker P.B. Travers A.A. EMBO Reports. 2001; 2: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). dMi2 is not likely to mediate repression by TTK69 of the eve promoter because it binds TTK69 through a 100 aa region lying immediately upstream of the zinc fingers of TTK69 outside of the POZ/BTB domain (16Murawsky C.M. Brehm A. Badenhorst P. Lowe N. Becker P.B. Travers A.A. EMBO Reports. 2001; 2: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69 is known to contribute to the interaction with dCtBP (15Wen Y. Nguyen D. Li Y. Lai Z.-C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results, however, indicate that repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter is neither affected by changing dCtBP levels nor is sensitive to trichostatin A (TSA) treatment. These observations, together with the known requirement for the presence of GAGA at the promoter (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), argue in favor of a quenching or masking mechanism in which the binding of TTK69 compromises the activation potential of GAGA by preventing its interaction with the transcription machinery. Most likely, GAGA-TTK69 interaction occurs at the promoter because GAGA·TTK69 complexes bind DNA with an apparent higher affinity than GAGA itself. Proteins—The proteins used in these experiments correspond to the GAGA519 (2Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and TTK69 isoforms (8Xiong W.C. Montell C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Read D. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). POZTTK corresponds to a truncated TTK69 form that carries the first 114 residues of TTK69. Proteins were expressed in BL21LysS or BL21 Escherichia coli cells as His6-tagged proteins using pET14 expression vectors (Novagen) and/or as GST fusions proteins using pGEX-KG vectors (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against bacterial expressed GAGA519 and TTK69 proteins were obtained and purified by conventional methods. Transcription Assays in S2 Cells—Repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter was analyzed by transient expression experiments in cultured S2 cells using a pGL3 reporter plasmid (Promega) carrying a luciferase reporter gene fused to a 1.8-kb fragment of the eve promoter (from position +102 to position –1759) that was found to drive transcription within the limits of stripe 2 (17Small S. Blair A. Levine M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4047-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) or similar plasmids carrying truncated promoters containing only the proximal promoter region. Reporter plasmids were co-transfected with pAct5CPPA vectors expressing the proteins indicated in each case. POZTTK corresponds to a truncated TTK69 form carrying the first 114 aa of TTK69. ΔTTK580 is a C-terminal deletion to aa 580 of TTK69. ΔPOZGAGA is a N-terminal deletion to aa 122 of GAGA519 that was expressed as a N-terminal His6-tagged polypeptide, which contrary to untagged ΔPOZGAGA (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was found to be efficiently expressed in S2 cells (data not shown). POZTTKΔPOZGAGA corresponds to a fusion protein in which the first 122 aa of GAGA519 were replaced by the first 114 aa of TTK69. dCtBP (18Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was expressed as a C-terminal FLAG fusion protein. For each assay, 7 μg of the corresponding reporter plasmid were co-transfected to S2 cells together with increasing amounts of pAct5CPPA vectors expressing the proteins indicated in each case. 3 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (Stratagene) were added to the transfection mixture to allow correction for variations in transfection efficiencies. Total DNA was adjusted to 20 μg by the addition of pAct5CPPA. Transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate method. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed according to the β-galactosidase gene reporter kit (Roche Applied Science). Luciferase activity was determined according to the luciferase activity assay kit (Promega) and normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity. When the effect of TSA was determined, cells were treated with 300 nm TSA 20 h before harvesting. For RNAi experiments, a EcoRI/HindIII fragment (∼500 bp) of the dCtBP-coding sequence was inserted in pBluescript (Stratagene) and transcribed in vitro using T3/T7 RNA polymerases. Increasing amounts of double-stranded RNA were co-transfected to S2 cells as indicated. EMSA Experiments—For EMSA experiments, increasing amounts of bacterial expressed GAGA519 and/or TTK69 were incubated with 1 ng of 32P-labeled –173eve DNA fragment obtained from the corresponding pGL3 plasmid in 100 mm KCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 8% glycerol in the presence of 1 μg of bovine serum albumin and a 100-fold excess (w/w) of E. coli DNA for 20 min at 20 °C in a final volume of 25 μl. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on 0.8% agarose, 0.5× TBE gels. Electrophoresis was performed at 100 V and 4 °C. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and autoradiographs were recorded on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) at –80 °C. DNase I Footprinting—For DNase I footprinting, protein-DNA complexes were prepared as described above for EMSA experiments and treated with DNase I in 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2. Digestion was allowed to proceed at 20 °C for 1 min and stopped by the addition of 4 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm NaCl, and 0.5% SDS. Samples were then analyzed electrophoretically in 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea, and TBE-denaturing gels. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and autoradiographs were recorded on Hyperfilm at –80 °C. GST Pull-down Assays—GST and GST-POZTTK proteins were expressed in E. coli and bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Protein concentrations, determined by gel electrophoresis, were adjusted by dilution with unbound beads. Agarose-bound GST fusion proteins were equilibrated in buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and 25 μl of beads were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled –173eve fragment that was preincubated or not with 1 μg of recombinant GAGA519 for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 100 μl. Beads were washed three times with 450 μl of buffer D and once with 450 μl of 0.2 m KCl-buffer D. DNA was recovered by incubation with 100 μl of 1% SDS, 1% NaHCO3 twice, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Samples were analyzed on 8% PAGE-0.5× TBE, dried, and exposed to x-ray-sensitive film. The Most Proximal eve Promoter Region, Which Contains Binding Sites for GAGA but Not for TTK69, Is Sufficient for TTK69 Repression of GAGA-dependent Activation—We showed previously (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that, in S2 cells, overexpression of TTK69 represses transcription from a truncated eve promoter spanning 1.7 kb of the 5′ region flanking the transcription start site to position –1759. This truncated promoter contains the core promoter elements and all cis-regulatory sequences necessary to drive transcription within the limits of stripe 2 (17Small S. Blair A. Levine M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4047-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Our previous results also indicate that repression by TTK69 of the eve stripe 2 promoter occurs only when it is activated by GAGA (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the eve stripe 2 promoter, most of the GAGA and TTK69-binding sites cluster at the proximal promoter region between positions +1 and –400 (Fig. 1A). As determined by DNase I footprinting, this region contains at least eight binding sites for GAGA and four for TTK69 (19Read D. Nishigaki T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1990; 10: 4334-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A deleted eve promoter that contains only the proximal promoter elements up to position –413 recapitulates the results reported earlier with the full eve stripe 2 promoter (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The profile of activation by GAGA of the –413eve promoter construct (Fig. 1B, left panel) is not significantly different from that obtained with the full eve stripe 2 promoter, and TTK69 represses very efficiently GAGA-dependent activation of the deleted –413eve promoter (Fig. 1B, right panel). Within the proximal eve promoter, the four TTK69-binding sites map between positions –200 and –400 (19Read D. Nishigaki T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1990; 10: 4334-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) so that the most proximal promoter region from position +1 to –173 contains no binding sites for TTK69, although it still carries several GAGA-binding sites of high affinity (Fig. 1A). The absence of TTK69-binding sites within the deleted –173eve promoter was corroborated in vitro by EMSA (Fig. 2) and DNase I footprinting experiments (Fig. 3). No significant retardation of the –173eve promoter fragment was observed upon the addition of up to 720 ng of bacterially expressed TTK69 (Fig. 2B). Similarly, no detectable DNase I footprints were observed even in the presence of up to 1200 ng of TTK69 (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, TTK69 binds the –413eve promoter fragment with significant affinity, showing 50–60% binding in the presence of 100 ng of protein (data not shown). The binding of GAGA to the –173eve promoter fragment was also confirmed by EMSA and DNase I footprinting (Figs. 2 and 3). Significant binding was observed in the presence of 400 ng of GAGA, and full retardation was obtained upon the addition of 600 ng of GAGA (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, four strong DNase I footprints were detected (Fig. 3A) that corresponded to the four central GAGA-binding sites contained within the –173eve promoter fragment (Fig. 3D), the two furthermost 5′- and 3′-GAGA-binding sites not being resolved under the experimental conditions of Fig. 3A.Fig. 3The binding of GAGA and TTK69 to the –173eve promoter is analyzed by DNase I footprinting. The binding of GAGA (A) or TTK69 (B) to the –173eve promoter DNA fragment is presented as a function of increasing amounts of protein: 0 ng (lanes 0); 200 ng (lanes 1); 400 ng (lanes 2); 800 ng (lanes 3); and 1200 ng (lanes 4). In C, DNase I footprinting was carried out in the absence (lane –) or in the presence of 100 ng of GAGA (lanes 0–4) and increasing amounts of TTK69: 0 ng (lane 0); 200 ng (lane 1); 400 ng (lane 2); 800 ng (lane 3); and 1200 ng (lane 4). Lanes C, correspond to G+A sequencing ladders. Regions showing footprints are indicated. 5′ to 3′ direction are also indicated. Summary of the results is shown in D. Observed footprints are indicated by boxes, and previously reported GAGA-binding sites (19Read D. Nishigaki T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1990; 10: 4334-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GAGA activated transcription from the deleted –173eve promoter (Fig. 1C, left panel). This activation was strictly dependent on the ability of GAGA to bind DNA because a H361P mutation in the DNA-binding domain of GAGA, which impairs DNA binding (20Kosoy A. Pagans S. Espinás M.L. Azorín F. Bernués J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42280-42288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), fully abolished activation (data not shown). Interestingly, TTK69 can still repress very efficiently GAGA-dependent activation of the –173eve promoter (Fig. 1C, right panel). These results indicate that repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation occurs in the absence of bona fide TTK69-binding sites on the template, suggesting that it does not require direct interaction of TTK69 with DNA. The POZ/BTB Domain of TTK69 Is Sufficient for Repression of GAGA-dependent Activation—As reported previously (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter requires the contribution of the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69 because a truncated ΔPOZTTK form is not competent in repressing GAGA-mediated activation. Actually, the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69 was sufficient to repress GAGA-mediated activation because overexpression of POZTTK, a truncated form that carries only the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69, was capable of repressing the eve stripe 2 promoter (Fig. 4), although less efficiently than full-length TTK69. POZTTK lacked the two zinc fingers that mediated DNA binding. Therefore, these results are in good agreement with the strong repression observed in the absence of bona fide TTK69-binding sites on the template and provide additional evidence in favor of a model in which repression by TTK69 of GAGA-mediated activation does not require the binding of TTK69 to DNA. The essential contribution to repression of the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69 was also revealed when the POZ/BTB domain of GAGA was replaced by that of TTK69. Such a fusion protein, POZTTKΔPOZGAGA, was not capable by itself of activating the eve stripe 2 promoter (Fig. 5A) but, on the other hand, was still capable to efficiently repress GAGA-mediated activation (Fig. 5B). It might be argued that, in this case, repression is the consequence of a direct competition for binding to the template because POZTTKΔPOZGAGA carries the DNA-binding domain of GAGA; therefore, it can bind the same DNA sequences as GAGA. To test for this hypothesis, we analyzed the effects on GAGA-mediated activation of the eve promoter of a truncated form of GAGA, ΔPOZGAGA, which was missing the POZ/BTB domain. ΔPOZGAGA binds DNA very efficiently (21Espinás M.L. Jiménez-García E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernués J. Azorín F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16461-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but it cannot by itself activate transcription (Fig. 5C). Moreover, this truncated form repressed GAGA-mediated activation very inefficiently since only a modest repression was observed at very high protein concentration (Fig. 5D). In these experiments, POZTTKΔPOZGAGA and ΔPOZGAGA were expressed to equivalent levels as judged by Western blotting and accumulated in the nucleus (data not shown). These results indicate that repression by POZTTKΔPOZGAGA of GAGA-dependent activation was not likely the result of competition for the GAGA-binding sites. GAGA·TTK69 Complexes Bind DNA in Vitro—The results reported above show that repression by TTK69 of GAGA-mediated activation of the eve promoter does not involve the binding of TTK69 to DNA. Repression, however, involves direct GAGA-TTK69 interaction because it requires the contribution of the POZ/BTB domain of GAGA (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as that of TTK69, which is necessary (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, as shown above, sufficient for repression. Therefore, it might be possible that GAGA-TTK69 interaction would prevent GAGA from binding DNA, thus impairing activation. Inconsistent with this hypothesis, in vitro, the binding of GAGA to the –173eve promoter was facilitated in the presence of TTK69 (Fig. 2C) so that when binding is assayed by EMSA at a GAGA concentration showing ∼50% retardation (Fig. 2C, lane 0), full retardation is observed upon the addition of TTK69 at concentrations that by themselves show no binding to the –173eve promoter fragment (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1–3 in panel C with lanes 2–4 in panel B). Similar results were obtained by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 3C). The addition of increasing amounts of TTK69 at a GAGA concentration that by itself does not give rise to any detectable footprint resulted in the formation of clear footprints (Fig. 3C, compare lane 0 with lanes 1–4). These footprints were restricted to the GAGA-binding sites contained within the –173eve promoter because no detectable protection to DNase I cleavage was observed outside of them. Sites 2, 3, and 4 were significantly protected, but under these conditions, site 1 was only weakly protected. The binding of GAGA to the –173eve promoter fragment resulted in the formation of complexes of very high molecular mass that can only be resolved electrophoretically in low percentage (0.8%) agarose gels (Fig. 2A). The high molecular mass of GAGA·DNA complexes reflect the oligomeric character of GAGA and the presence of multiple GAGA-binding sites on the template (21Espinás M.L. Jiménez-García E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernués J. Azorín F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16461-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, ternary TTK69·GAGA·DNA complexes were likely to behave as a heterogeneous population of very high molecular mass rather than as a single electrophoretic species. Actually, in the presence of GAGA and TTK69, a smear of very high molecular mass was observed (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3), probably reflecting the formation of such ternary complex. Consistent with this interpretation, in GST pull-down assays, the complex formed by GAGA with the –173eve promoter fragment bound very efficiently a GST-POZTTK fusion protein (Fig. 2D). In these experiments, radioactively labeled –173eve DNA fragment was first incubated with GAGA to form the protein-DNA complex and then assayed for binding to either GST-POZTTK or GST. As shown in Fig. 2D, the GAGA·DNA complex was efficiently bound by GST-POZTTK (Fig. 2D, lane 4) but not by GST (Fig. 2D, lane 2). Moreover, the binding of the complex to GST-POZTTK was strictly dependent on the presence of GAGA, because no retention was observed when preincubation with GAGA was omitted (Fig. 2D, lane 3). Altogether, these results indicate that binding of TTK69 does not prevent binding of GAGA to DNA. On the contrary, DNA binding increases in the presence of TTK69, suggesting that GAGA·TTK69 complexes bind DNA with a higher affinity than GAGA. Repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent Activation Is Not Affected by Changing dCtBP Levels Nor Is It Sensitive to Treatment with TSA—It is known that TTK69 interacts physically and genetically with dCtBP (15Wen Y. Nguyen D. Li Y. Lai Z.-C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actually, a P-DLS consensus dCtBP binding motif was located at the C-terminal region of TTK69 (aa 591–595). Mutations at this motif modified the functional properties of TTK69 (15Wen Y. Nguyen D. Li Y. Lai Z.-C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This motif, however, did not appear to contribute to repression because a truncated ΔTTK580 form carrying a C-terminal deletion up to aa 580 repressed GAGA-mediated activation of the eve promoter as efficiently as full-length TTK69 (Fig. 4B). Nevertheless, in vitro, the binding of dCtBP to TTK69 appeared to be largely mediated by the POZ/BTB domain (15Wen Y. Nguyen D. Li Y. Lai Z.-C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that, as shown here, was sufficient for repression of GAGA-dependent activation (Fig. 4A). Therefore, in this case, dCtBP could mediate repression through its binding to the POZ/BTB domain rather than by binding to the P-DLS motif. Inconsistent with this hypothesis, no synergism was observed when dCtBP and TTK69 were co-expressed. As shown in Fig. 6A, the efficiency of repression by TTK69 did not increase when dCtBP was overexpressed. In these experiments, dCtBP was efficiently expressed and showed a nuclear localization (data not shown). Moreover, the dCtBP form used here was found to be functional in S2 cells because in a different promoter context, its overexpression was shown to interfere with activation (22Ryu J.-R. Olson L.K. Arnosti D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12960-12965Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In good agreement with these results, co-transfection of increasing amounts of RNAi directed against dCtBP showed no significant effect on the ability of TTK69 to repress GAGA-mediated activation of the eve promoter (Fig. 6B). In parallel experiments, a significant decrease in dCtBP levels was detected when overexpressed in the presence of increasing amounts of RNAi directed against dCtBP (data not shown). POZ/BTB is an evolutionary conserved domain present in many transcriptional repressors. In several cases, its contribution to repression was found to be mediated by TSA-sensitive histone deacetylases (23Dhordain P. Albagli O. Lin R.J. Ansieau S. Quief S. Leutz A. Kerckaert J.P.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2549-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter was insensitive to treatment with TSA. As shown in Fig. 6C, the ability of TTK69 to repress GAGA-mediated activation was not significantly affected when cells were treated in the presence of 300 nm TSA, although under these conditions, significant changes in histone acetylation levels were detected (data not shown). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter was not likely mediated by dCtBP or TSA-sensitive histone deacetylases. In this paper, we have shown that repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter occurred in the absence of TTK69 binding to DNA. Several models could account for these results (Fig. 7). It would be possible that GAGA-TTK69 hetero-oligomers would not be capable of binding DNA (Fig. 7B) or that, by interacting with the transcription activation machinery, TTK69 would prevent its recruitment by GAGA to the promoter (Fig. 7C). However, earlier results (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that repression by TTK69 of the eve stripe 2 promoter depends on its activation by GAGA and requires the contribution of the POZ/BTB domains of GAGA and TTK69, strongly suggesting that it actually involves direct GAGA-TTK69 interaction. Moreover, in vitro, GAGA-TTK69 hetero-oligomers appeared as fully competent in binding DNA (Fig. 2). These results argue in favor of models in which GAGA contributed to the recruitment of TTK69 to the promoter (Fig. 7, D and E). In agreement with this hypothesis, repression occurred in the absence of TTK69-binding sites on the template and the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69 showed by itself a significant repressive effect. Nevertheless, TTK69 forms capable of binding DNA were more efficient than POZTTK in repressing GAGA-mediated activation, indicating that TTK69-DNA interactions further stabilize the ternary protein-DNA complex and therefore increase the efficiency of repression. This possibility becomes particularly evident in promoter constructs containing binding sites for TTK69. However, also in the absence of TTK69-binding sites as in the –173eve promoter fragment, GAGA-TTK69 hetero-oligomers appeared to bind DNA with higher affinity than GAGA homo-oligomers themselves (Figs. 2 and 3). The binding of GAGA-TTK69 hetero-oligomers to the –173eve promoter was constrained to the GAGA-binding sites because no additional DNase I footprints were detected in the presence of TTK69 (Fig. 3), suggesting that, in this case, direct protein-protein interactions or, more likely, non sequence-specific TTK69-DNA interactions help to stabilize the binding of GAGA to DNA. Altogether, the observations discussed above strongly suggest that repression involves direct GAGA-TTK69 interaction at the promoter. GAGA·TTK69 complexes could actively participate in the recruitment of co-repressor complexes (Fig. 7E). Actually, TTK69 is known to interact with several co-repressors such as dMi2 and dCtBP (15Wen Y. Nguyen D. Li Y. Lai Z.-C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Murawsky C.M. Brehm A. Badenhorst P. Lowe N. Becker P.B. Travers A.A. EMBO Reports. 2001; 2: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, dMi2 did not appear to mediate repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation because dMi2-TTK69 interaction occurs through a region lying outside of the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69, which as shown here is sufficient for repression (Figs. 4 and 5). Similarly, in this context, dCtBP did not seem to have a contribution to repression because no significant effects were observed upon dCtBP overexpression or RNAi-mediated inhibition (Fig. 6). However, our results point out the essential contribution to repression of the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69. In several cases, the contribution of POZ/BTB domain to repression was shown to be mediated by TSA-sensitive histone deacetylases (23Dhordain P. Albagli O. Lin R.J. Ansieau S. Quief S. Leutz A.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2549-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, repression by TTK69 of GAGA-mediated activation of the eve promoter was insensitive to treatment with TSA. These results indicate that, if mediated by co-repressors, repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation of the eve promoter did not likely involve any of the co-repressors known to interact with TTK69 or TSA-sensitive histone deacetylases. Alternatively, the binding of TTK69 might have simply interfered with the ability of GAGA to load and/or assemble the activation complex at the promoter (Fig. 7D). Several repressors have been found to act through such a quenching or masking mechanism (reviewed in Refs. 31Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 32Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In favor of this hypothesis, TTK69 efficiently repressed GAGA-mediated activation of the eve promoter but not basal transcription (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, POZTTKΔPOZGAGA did not affect basal transcription (Fig. 5A). These results, together with the reported interactions of TTK69 with dCtBP and dMi2, suggest that depending on the promoter and the developmental stage, TTK69 might repress transcription through different mechanisms. How could TTK69 interfere with the interaction of GAGA with the transcription machinery? It was shown earlier that the C-terminal glutamine-rich domain of GAGA is essential for GAGA-dependent activation both in vitro and in vivo (4Vaquero A. Espinás M.L. Azorín F. Bernués J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the results reported here show that, in addition, the POZ/BTB domain also appeared to have a direct contribution to activation because ΔPOZGAGA did not efficiently activate the eve promoter. It might be argued that the inability of ΔPOZGAGA to activate transcription reflects the contribution of the POZ/BTB domain to oligomerization. However, POZTTKΔPOZGAGA did not activate transcription (Fig. 5), although it is capable of oligomerization because the POZ/BTB domain of TTK69 also mediates homo-oligomerization (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of TTK69 occurs through the POZ/BTB domain of GAGA (14Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Espinás M.L. Bernués J. Azorín F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is feasible that the binding of TTK69 would quench the contribution to activation of the POZ/BTB domain of GAGA. In this context, it is interesting to note that the POZ/BTB domain of bric-à-brac was reported to interact with dTAFII155 (34Pointud J.C. Larsson J. Dastugue B. Couderc J.L. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 368-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). If conserved, this interaction might account for the contribution of the POZ/BTB domain of GAGA to activation, providing at the same time a rationale for repression by TTK69 of GAGA-dependent activation. TTK69 might disrupt GAGA-dTAFII155 interaction by displacing dTAFII155 from the complex and/or competing with GAGA for dTAFII155 binding. The inability of POZTTKΔPOZGAGA to activate transcription suggests that, although highly homologous (40% identity), the POZ/BTB domains of GAGA and TTK69 are not functionally exchangeable. The crystal structure of the POZ/BTB domain of the human promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein was solved (35Li X. Peng H. Schultz D.C. Lopez-Guisa J.M. Rauscher III, F.J. Marmonstein R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5275-5282PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Privé G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The structure revealed a tightly interwound dimer with a surface-exposed groove that only existed in the dimer and was proposed to be involved in ligand binding (36Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Privé G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 8, the POZ/BTB domains of GAGA and TTK69 differ significantly at regions α1/β2 (aa 22–37) and α3/β4 (aa 58–68) that formed the floor and walls of the groove mentioned above, suggesting that they might sustain binding of different ligands. At this region, bric-à-brac shows a higher homology to TTK69 than to GAGA (Fig. 8). Repression by TTK69 of GAGA-mediated activation of the eve promoter solely requires the contribution of the POZ/BTB domain, which is shared by TTK88, strongly suggesting that the results reported here can also be extrapolated to TTK88. GAGA and TTK are maternally provided transcription factors that in the early Drosophila embryo regulate the expression of several pair-rules genes (5Brown J.L. Sonoda S. Ueda H. Scott M.P. Wu C.

In this context, GAGA-TTK interaction might contribute to the establishment of the program of their zygotic expression by preventing the activator from activating. Additional elements facilitating or resolving GAGA-TTK interaction would also contribute to properly regulate their expression program. We thank Dr. D. Arnosti and Dr. M.

C., Janmey, P. A., and Kirschner, M. W. (1998) J. Cell Biol. 140, 1125–1136; Hinchliffe, K. (2000) Curr. Biol. 10, R104–R1051). Three related phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PI(4)P 5-kinases) have been identified in mammalian cells (types Iα, Iβ, and Iγ) and appear to play distinct roles in actin remodeling. Here we have identified a fourth member of this family by searching the human genome and EST data bases. This new protein, which we have designated phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase homolog (PIPKH), is expressed at relatively high levels in brain and testis. Immunoprecipitates of PIPKH expressed in mammalian cells contain PI(4)P 5-kinase activity, but this activity is not affected by mutations in residues that inactivate other type I PI(4)P 5-kinases. We show that the PI(4)P 5-kinase activity in PIPKH immunoprecipitates can be explained by the ability of PIPKH to heterodimerize with other type I PI(4)P 5-kinases. Transfection of 293t cells with PIPKH resulted in >8-fold increase in total phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) without a significant net increase in total PI(4,5)P2. When coexpressed with PIPKH, green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct of the pleckstrin homology domain from Bruton's tyrosine kinase (GFP-BTK-PH) localized in intracellular vesicular structures, suggesting an unusual intracellular site of PI(3,4,5)P3 production. Finally, expression of PIPKH induced the reorganization of actin from predominantly stress fibers to predominantly foci and comets similar to those observed previously in cells infected with the intracellular pathogen Listeria or transfected with recombinant PIPKIα. These results suggest that PIPKH acts as a scaffold to localize and regulate type I PI(4)P 5-kinases and the synthesis of PI(3,4,5)P3.

Control of cellular functions involving membrane trafficking and adhesion requires rapid, reversible, and localized assembly of the actin cytoskeleton as well as of other functional complexes such as focal adhesions (1Ma L.

These assemblages of structural and signaling proteins provide a delimited zone of infrastructure, mechanical support, or directionality for dynamic membrane processes. Rapid and reversible assembly of the cytoskeletal framework for membrane vesicle formation, endo- and exocytosis, and cell migration is regulated by the generation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) 1The abbreviations used are: PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate; PI(5)P, phosphatidylinositol(5)phosphate; PI(4)P, phosphatidylinositol-(4)phosphate; PI(3)P, phosphatidylinositol(3)phosphate; PIPK, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase; PIPKH, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase homolog; BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ARFs, ADP-ribosylation factors; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GST, glutathione S-transferase, MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WASP, the Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome protein; NFDM, nonfat dry milk; EST, expressed sequence tag; HA, hemagglutinin; 3-PAP, 3-phosphatase adaptor protein. by phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) (5Ishihara H.

It is now well established that this phosphoinositide is a signaling molecule in its own right, acting through several actin-binding proteins, members of the Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) family of proteins, and the Arp2/3 complex (7Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), as well as by controlling the localization of a subset of proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. Dynamin, a large GTPase that is required for fission of nascent vesicles from Golgi and plasma membranes, binds to PI(4,5)P2 by its PH domain and is found at actin-rich sites in peripheral ruffles of eukaryotic cells as well as in actin comets and tails generated by the intracellular pathogen Listeria or by overexpression of type I PIPKs (5Ishihara H.

In addition, PI(4,5)P2 is converted by phosphoinositide 3-kinases to PI(3,4,5)P3, which can activate members of the Rho/Rac/CDC42 family of GTP-binding proteins to initiate actin cytoskeletal remodeling (1Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The PIPKs compose two families of phosphoinositide kinase, designated types I and II; type I PIPKs are phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases, and type II PIPKs are phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinases (10Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The three isoforms of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, designated types Iα, Iβ, and Iγ, are responsible for the bulk of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis in metazoan cells (2Hinchliffe K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R104-R105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 synthesis by the type I PIPKs is regulated by members of the Rho/Rac/CDC42 family of GTP-binding proteins (6Tolias K.F. Hartwig J.H. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L.

The predominant splice variant of type IγPIPK, the major isoform found in brain, is recruited to focal adhesions and activated by an interaction with talin (4Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 13Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This isoform is expressed specifically in brain and is the major PI(4,5)P2 synthesizing enzyme at the synapse, where it is concentrated (14Wenk M.R. Pellegrini L. Klenchin V.A. Di Paolo G. Chang S. Daniell L. Arioka M. Martin T.F. De Camilli P. Neuron. 2001; 32: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In comparison to that of the type I PIPKs, the regulation and signaling functions of the type II PIPKs are less well understood (10Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We have identified a gene on human chromosome 9 encoding a protein homologous to the known (type I and type II) PIPKs by searching the translated human genome data base for the sequence DYSLL, which is conserved in all type I as well as type II PIPKs. The sequence is located in the N-terminal portion of the catalytic core (15Rao V.D. Misra S. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1998; 94: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Within this sequence, Asp278 and Leu282 of PIPKIIβ are predicted to interact with lipid and ATP substrate. Murine and human cDNAs were subsequently identified in the EST data base, the endogenous protein identified in brain membrane extracts, and the recombinant proteins characterized in mammalian and bacterial expression systems. This protein lacks detectable lipid kinase activity but associates with type I PIPKs in vivo and appears to act as a scaffold for localization of PIPK activity. Materials—Synthetic PI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(3,4P)2, PI(5)P, and PI(3,5)P2 were obtained from Echelon Research Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT). PI, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. DNA transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendation. PIPK Expression—The EcoRI-ApaI fragment of mouse brain cDNA clone A330090A02 (generously provided by the RIKEN Tsukuba Institute (Genome Exploration Group, RIKEN Genomic Science Center, Genome Science Laboratory)), containing the longest open reading frame, was inserted into the EcoRI-ApaI site of pcDNA3 for mammalian expression. The coding region was amplified by PCR employing Pfu DNA polymerase and inserted into pGEX4t3 (EcoRI-XhoI site), pFLAGCMV2 (EcoRI-BamHI site), and pBlueBacHis2a (BamHI-SalI site) for GST-tagged, FLAG-tagged, and His-tagged expression, respectively; all epitope tags were N-terminal. Oligonucleotide primer sequences are as follows: 5′-CAGAATTCGGCCACACCAAGCCTTAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTCCTCGAGTGAGTCATTCTGTGTGCACC-3′ (antisense) for pGEX4t3; 5′-CAGAATTCGGCCACACCAAGCCTTAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGGATCCAAGGGAAGAAGGCAGACACG-3′ (antisense) for pFLAGCMV2; and 5′-CAGGATCCGCCACACCAAGCCTTAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTCCTCGAGTGAGTCATTCTGTGTGCACC-3′ (antisense) for pBlueBacHis2a. FLAG-PIPKH and GST-PIPKH were purified by attachment to anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose and glutathione-agarose beads, respectively. Substitution of amino acid residues known to be necessary for catalytic activity of the known PIPKs were introduced into PIPKH by mutating Lys155 to Arg, and by mutating Asp281 to Ala using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide primer sequences are as follows: 5′-GCGCTTCTTTGTGAGGACCCAACGGCGCCACG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGTGGCGCCGTTGGGTCCTCACAAAGAAGCGC-3′ (antisense) for 155Lys→Arg, and 5′-GGTGAATGTACTGGCTTACAGCCTCCTGGTGGCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCCACCAGGAGGCTGTAAGCCAGTACATTCACC-3′ (antisense) for 281Asp→Ala. pFLAG-CMV2-PIPKH was transcribed and translated in vitro using the TnT rabbit reticulocyte coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and [35S]methionine to test for its ability to bind specifically various phospholipids arrayed on PVDF membranes. In vitro translated PIPKH was applied to phospholipids arrayed on PVDF membranes using a slot blot apparatus; in this system, proteins binding to phospholipid spots are detected by 35S autoradiography. PIPK Assay—PIPK activity was assayed in cell lysates and immunoprecipitates as described previously (30Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylserine was employed as carrier lipid in all assays. Tissue Distribution—Analysis of PIPKH expression was performed by Northern and Western analyses by standard methods. The mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot was obtained from Clontech and probed with full-length A330090A02. For Western analysis, lysates of frontal lobe from rat, mouse, and human brain were obtained by homogenization in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate) followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g to remove membranes and cytoskeleton. The membranes were extracted with 1 m NaCl and then with 1% Triton X-100. The cytosolic, salt-extracted, and detergent-extracted proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Lysates of 293t human embryonic kidney cells transfected with FLAG-PIPKH or with empty vector were run in parallel. Antiserum Production—Two rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-linked peptide corresponding to the 15 C-terminal residues (CYARRLSRWAEVHTE) of the mouse sequence. Serine was substituted for the cysteine residue in position 7 of this sequence in order to prevent dimerization. The antisera were produced by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and were designated 61434 and 61435, respectively. The antisera employed were from the third bleed of New Zealand White rabbits and were titered by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with free peptide bound in solid phase (1 μg/well). Titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution resulting in an A405 of 0.2, using biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate, and ABTS. The 10-week titers of antisera 61434 and 61435 were 55795 and 140834, respectively. Another rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against GST-PIPKH was affinity-purified by passage over a glutathione-agarose-GST-PIPKH column, with the antibody eluted by acid. Coexpression with PIPKs Iα, Iβ, and Iγ—293t HEK cells were cotransfected on 10-cm dishes with 2 μg of FLAG-PIPKH and 4 μg of HA-PIPK Iα, Iβ, or Iγ. PIPKH was immunoprecipitated with M2-agarose (anti-FLAG) beads, and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-HA (HA11) from Berkeley Antibody Co. In Vivo Labeling and Measurement of Phosphoinositides—293t cells were labeled at 37 °C with [3H]inositol (10 μCi/ml) for 24 h in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum as described previously (10Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted in acid methanol followed by chloroform, and deacylated as described previously (31Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Deacylated lipids were analyzed by HPLC using a shallow ammonium phosphate gradient (10–35 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.8) over 100 min, to separate the glycerol-phosphorylinositol phosphate derivatives of the cellular phosphoinositides (10Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Coexpression with GFP-tagged PH Domains—FLAG-tagged PIPKH or PIPKIβ (2 μg of DNA per well) and EGFP-tagged PH domains from Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK; 1 μg DNA per well) and phospholipase Cδ were cotransfected into NIH-3T3 cells to study the localization of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, respectively, in serum-stimulated cells in the presence or absence of wortmannin. NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with pBTK-PH-EGFP, pdsRed1-N1, pFLAG-CMV2, pFLAG-CMV2-PIPKH, pCMV, and/or pCMV-PIPKH using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) and observed 24 h after transfection. Wortmannin was used at a final concentration of 200 nm for 2 h prior to fluorescence microscopy. Live cells were imaged in a 37 °C microscope chamber using a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope equipped with a Sensys CCD (charge-coupled device) digital camera (Photometrics), and images were processed using ImagePro Plus 4.1 (MediaCybernetics) and Vaytek Imaging Software (Fairfield, IA). Standard epifluorescence filter sets for EGFP and dsRed were obtained from Chroma Technologies. Single color control experiments demonstrated insignificant signal cross-contamination between channels. All images were captured in gray scale. Pseudocolor was added to allow comparisons between images when they were merged. Digital confocal images were obtained by imaging adjacent focal planes at 0.3-μm intervals, and three adjacent images underwent nearest-neighbor rapid deconvolution using a calculated point-spread function and Vaytek Microtome image deconvolution software. Visualization of Actin in PIPKH-expressing Cells—NIH-3T3 cells were plated on coverslips in 6-well tissue culture plates and transfected with 0–4 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-PIPKH or pFLAG-CMV2-PIPKH (155Lys→Arg/281Asp→Ala), using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent. After 24 h, cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature in cytoskeletal buffer (CSB: 10 mm MES pH 6.1, 138 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA) containing 3.7% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed three times in CSB and permeabilized in CSB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM). The coverslips were washed once in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% NFDM and incubated with mouse monoclonal M5 anti-FLAG antibody in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% NFDM for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% NFDM, and incubated with CY2-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody plus rhodamine phalloidin (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Fluoromount after three washes in PBS. Cells were visualized by epifluorescence and spinning disc confocal microscopy. Identification of a Novel PIPK Homolog in the Human Genome Sequence Data Base—The sequence DYSLL, conserved in the lipid kinase domain catalytic core of all known PIPKs, was used to search the high throughput genome sequence data base to identify related sequences in the tBlastn search mode. As expected, the search identified all heretofore cloned PIPK genes (types I and II). In addition, a highly related gene sequence (clone AL157935) was identified on human chromosome 9. The cDNA sequence predicted to encode the putative chromosome 9 PIPK was assembled from the ENSEMBL data base and was used to identify related sequences in the nonredundant and EST nucleotide data bases in the Blastn search mode. ESTs corresponding to rat and mouse isoforms of the putative human chromosome 9 PIPK were identified and used to search the nucleotide data bases in the Blastn search mode. Numerous cDNA sequences were identified in this fashion in the RIKEN data base, from which three mouse clones, designated A330090A02, A330097I22, and A830027C23 (GenBank™ accession numbers BB195634, BB197130, and BB266750, respectively) were selected and generously provided by the RIKEN Tsukuba Institute (Genome Exploration Group, RIKEN Genomic Science Center, Genome Science Laboratory). The three clones were of identical sequence, encoding a protein of 395 amino acids, and all further analysis was performed using clone A330090A02. Fig. 1 displays the human and mouse isoforms aligned with human types Iα,Iβ,IIα, and IIβ PIPKs. The human sequence assembled from the genome data base using ENSEMBL predicts a protein containing an 83-residue N-terminal extension not found in the murine isoform. Two in-frame translation termination codons are present upstream of the putative initiation codon of the murine isoenzyme. The predicted molecular mass of the murine PIPKH is 45290 daltons. The primary sequence does not contain any known functional protein domain outside the catalytic (lipid kinase; residues 129–395) core, as analyzed by Pfam. Tissue Distribution—At the level of mRNA, expression of PIPKH is highest in brain and testis relative to heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney, in which mRNA expression appears very low (Fig. 2) or absent. Multiple bands in the brain and testis lanes suggest the presence of multiple size variants of the mature message and alternative splicing of the primary transcript. However, we did not encounter splice variants in the process of sequencing multiple cDNA clones, both murine and human, of PIPKH. Western analysis of brain extracts (Fig. 3) demonstrates the presence in rat brain of a single molecular mass species of protein cross-reacting with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against GST-PIPKH. Analysis of mouse brain extracts yielded identical results (not shown). The human isoform, present in brain homogenates or expressed as a recombinant FLAG epitope-tagged protein in 293t cells, is only weakly cross-reactive with the antibody raised against murine PIPKH (not shown). The protein found in human brain is identical to the rat brain isoform in molecular mass (not shown), suggesting that the N-terminal extension of PIPKH predicted by the annotated human genome sequence is not actually expressed in vivo and that the actual N terminus is Met84 of the human isoform in Fig. 1. The endogenous rat brain protein shown in lanes 4–6 of Fig. 5 appears to migrate slightly slower than does recombinant murine FLAG-PIPKH expressed in 293t human embryonic kidney cells, raising the possibility of tissue- or species-specific post-translational modification.Fig. 3Western analysis of PIPKH in brain extracts.

FLAG-PIPKH, HA-PIPKH, and GST-PIPKH were purified with anti-FLAG (M2)-, anti HA (HA11)-, and glutathi-one-coupled agarose beads, respectively, and assayed for phosphoinositide kinase activity (Fig. 4). The GST fusion protein expressed in bacteria and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads displayed no detectable PI(4)P 5-kinase or PI(5)P 4-kinase activity (Fig. 4a and data not shown), whereas all type I PIPKs are enzymatically active when expressed in bacteria. 2J.

In contrast, when presented with crude brain phosphoinositides (not shown) or synthetic PI(4)P plus [γ-32P]ATP, immunoprecipitates of FLAG epitope-tagged PIPKH expressed in 293t cells catalyzed 32P incorporation into two lipids that comigrated with PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 standards by TLC (Fig. 4a). Deacylation and HPLC analysis of the two lipid products of the FLAG-PIPKH kinase reaction recovered from the TLC plates in both cases yielded radioactive species that comigrated with glycerol-phosphorylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating that the 32P-labeled phosphoinositide comigrating with PI(3,4,5)P3 is lyso-PI(4,5)P2 and not PI(3,4,5)P3. Supporting this conclusion was the detection of lyso-PI(4)P in the synthetic PI(4)P preparation, in a proportion to the diacyl form consistent with the relative activities of the two lipid products recovered from the TLC plates (data not shown). The PI(4)P 5-kinase activity associated with PIPKH was not inhibited by wortmannin (data not shown). Immunoprecipitates of FLAG epitope-tagged PIPKH exhibited no detectable activity on the following synthetic lipids: diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, PI(3)P, PI(5)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 4b and data not shown). When similar amounts of recombinant protein were assayed for PI(4)P 5-kinase activity, immunoprecipitates of HA epitope-tagged PIPKH were found to exhibit relatively low activity, similar to that of catalytically inactivated mutants of PIPKIα and PIPKIβ, when compared with wild-type recombinant PIPKIα and PIPKIβ (Fig. 4c). When assayed for PI(5)P 4-kinase activity, immunoprecipitates of wild-type recombinant type I PIPKs catalyzed the formation of a small amount of 32P-labeled lipid comigrating with PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 4c). This could be due to the presence either of contaminating PI(4)P in the PI(5)P substrate preparation or of type II PIPK in immunoprecipitates of type I PIPKs. In contrast, PIPKH and catalytically inactive mutants of type I PIPKs yielded no detectable product when PI(5)P was used as substrate (Fig. 4c). Thus, PI(4)P and lyso-PI(4)P appear to be the only phosphoinositide substrates of the catalytic activity associated with PIPKH. PIPKH Does Not Bind to Immobilized Phospholipids in an in Vitro Transcription/Translation Binding Assay—We expressed pFLAG-CMV2-PIPKH in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system incorporating [35S]methionine. When in vitro translated PIPKH was applied to a PVDF membrane on which various phospholipids were arrayed, we did not detect significant binding to any of these lipids (data not shown), which included PI, PI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(5)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine. As a positive control in the same experiment, in vitro translated AKT (expressed at a similar level) bound to PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. Mutational Analysis of PIPKH Suggests That PI(4)P 5-Kinase Activity Is Not Intrinsic—Mutation of Lys155 to Arg or of Asp281 to Ala (amino acids corresponding to PIPKH residues Lys155 and Asp281 are required for PIPK activity in type I PIPKs) resulted in no significant reduction in the level of lipid kinase activity associated with PIPKH; likewise, the PI(4)P 5-kinase activity associated with a double mutant (155Lys→Arg/281Asp→Ala) of PIPKH was similar to that of wild-type PIPKH (Fig. 4a). PIPKH Associates with PIPKs Iα and Iβ—Since the PI(4)P 5-kinase activity in PIPKH immunoprecipitates did not appear to be intrinsic to the PIPKH itself, we investigated the possibility that PIPKH associates with an endogenous type I PIPK.

The ER-associated degradation pathway counteracts such aggregation through the elimination of misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We now show that SHP substrate-1 (SHPS-1), a transmembrane glycoprotein that regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and cell-cell communication, is a physiological substrate for the Skp1-Cullin1-NFB42-Rbx1 (SCFNFB42) E3 ubiquitin ligase, a proposed mediator of ER-associated degradation. SCFNFB42 mediated the polyubiquitination of immature SHPS-1 and its degradation by the proteasome. Ectopic expression of NFB42 both suppressed the formation of aggresome-like structures and the phosphorylation of the translational regulator eIF2α induced by overproduction of SHPS-1 as well as increased the amount of mature SHPS-1 at the cell surface. An NFB42 mutant lacking the F box domain had no such effects. Our results suggest that SCFNFB42 regulates SHPS-1 biosynthesis in response to ER stress.

Adhesion molecules on the surface of cells play pivotal roles in many physiological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and migration. Dysregulation of specific adhesion molecules has thus been shown to result in pathological conditions such as inflammation, neurodegeneration, and cancer metastasis.

The cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 acts as a scaffold for the assembly of multiprotein complexes (1Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol.

By recruiting the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to the cell membrane, SHPS-1 negatively or positively regulates intracellular signaling initiated either by tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors for growth factors or by cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins (13Cant C.A.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our studies with mice lacking most of the cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 have also revealed that this protein is an upstream signaling component important for SHP-2-mediated regulation of cell migration and cytoskeletal reorganization (15Inagaki K.

Expression of SHPS-1 in the central nervous system is regulated both during embryonic development and postnatally, and this regulation has been implicated in synapse formation or maintenance (6Comu S.

Narayanan V. Lagenaur C.F. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 416: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SHPS-1 is also down-regulated during cell transformation and thus might play a role in carcinogenesis (14Oshima K. Ruhul Amin A.R. Suzuki A. Hamaguchi M. Matsuda S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, of the mechanisms by which the cellular abundance of SHPS-1 is determined, although several oncogene products down-regulate SHPS-1 mRNA (18Machida K. Matsuda S. Yamaki K. Senga T. Thant A.A. Kurata H. Miyazaki K. Hayashi K. Okuda T. Kitamura T. Hayakawa T. Hamaguchi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1710-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to provide insight into SHPS-1 function by identifying proteins that regulate SHPS-1 or transduce signals emanating from its cytoplasmic region. We now demonstrate a physical and functional interaction between SHPS-1 and both neural F box protein of 42 kDa (NFB42) and S phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1) in mouse brain and melanocytes. NFB42 (recently renamed Fbx2) was first identified as a gene product that is highly enriched in the nervous system (19Erhardt J.A. Hynicka W. DiBenedetto A. Shen N. Stone N. Paulson H. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35222-35227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). F box proteins contain an F box domain and mediate substrate recognition by Skp1-Cullin1-F box protein-Rbx1 (SCF)-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes (20Craig K.L. Tyers M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 299-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of NFB42 was shown to inhibit the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells (19Erhardt J.A. Hynicka W. DiBenedetto A. Shen N. Stone N. Paulson H. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35222-35227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Skp1 is an invariant component of SCF-type E3 enzymes and is thought to control the cell cycle (21Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). NFB42 and Skp1 are thus implicated in the control of neuronal proliferation by protein ubiquitination, although the biological roles of these proteins remain to be established. Skp1 also participates in various signal transduction pathways, including that responsible for glucose-dependent reassembly of V-ATPase complexes (22Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 4: 384-391Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We now show that NFB42 and Skp1, together with Cullin1, constitute an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase (SCFNFB42) and that this complex catalyzes the polyubiquitination of immature forms of SHPS-1. Forced expression of NFB42 resulted in elimination of misfolded SHPS-1 molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway, an effect that was associated with marked inhibition of the formation of cellular aggregates containing SHPS-1. Furthermore, this elimination of misfolded SHPS-1 from the ER led to substantial up-regulation of SHPS-1 expression at the cell surface. We also provide evidence that SCFNFB42 functions to maintain ER homeostasis during cellular stress by supporting the biosynthesis of SHPS-1. Expression Vectors—The cDNAs encoding the SHPS-1 mutants SHPS-1–4F, in which all four tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region (Tyr408, Tyr432, Tyr449, and Tyr473) are replaced by phenylalanine, and SHPS-1-JM, in which two juxtamembrane lysine residues (Lys401 and Lys402) are replaced by asparagine and glutamine, respectively, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the full-length mouse SHPS-1 cDNA (2Yamao T. Matozaki T. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Takahashi N. Ochi F. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as a template and a Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Clontech). The wild-type and mutant SHPS-1 cDNAs were then inserted separately into the EcoRI and NotI site of pTracer-CMV (Invitrogen). To generate a cDNA encoding SHPS-1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), we performed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a full-length human SHPS-1 cDNA (2Yamao T. Matozaki T. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Takahashi N. Ochi F. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as a template, a T7 primer, and the antisense primer 5′-AAAGTCGACTTCTTCTACAAGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and then inserted into pEGFP N2 (Clontech). The pSRα vector encoding wild-type rat SHPS-1 was described previously (1Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3 vectors encoding hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged versions of either wild-type rat NFB42 (amino acids 2–296) or the deletion mutants NFBΔP (residues 53–296), NFBΔPΔF (residues 95–296), or NFBPF (residues 2–94) (19Erhardt J.A.

Pittman (University of Pennsylvania). To generate cDNAs encoding Myc epitope-tagged versions of wild-type NFB42 and NFBΔPΔF, we amplified the corresponding coding regions by PCR with the full-length NFB42 cDNA as template. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and SalI and then inserted in-frame into pCl-neo (Invitrogen) that had been modified to add the coding sequence for the Myc epitope to the 5′ end of the inserted cDNA. The pcDNA3 vectors encoding Myc epitope-tagged forms of mouse Skp1 and mouse Cullin1 were kindly provided by S. Hatakeyama (Kyushu University, Japan). Cells, Transfection, and Antibodies—Melan-a cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (200 ng/ml) (Sigma). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing wild-type mouse SHPS-1 (CHO-mSHPS-1 cells) were established as described previously (23Takada T. Matozaki T. Takeda H. Fukunaga K. Noguchi T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9234-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS. Transient transfection of CHO or Melan-a cells (∼4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) was performed with the use of a LipofectAMINE Transfection Kit (Invitrogen). In some experiments, cells were cultured in the presence of 10 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) or 2 μm thapsigargin (Sigma), or with the corresponding vehicle (0.025% dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.2% ethanol, respectively). A rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) to mouse SHPS-1 (24Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NFB42 (19Erhardt J.A. Hynicka W. DiBenedetto A. Shen N. Stone N. Paulson H. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35222-35227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were described previously. Mouse mAbs to human SIRPα1 and to Skp1 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories; rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SHPS-1 and to Ser51-phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; rabbit polyclonal antibodies to eIF2α were from Cell Signaling Technology; rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Cullin1 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; a mouse mAb to ubiquitin (P4D1) and normal rat or mouse IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Texas Red-conjugated sheep polyclonal antibodies to mouse IgG were from Amersham Biosciences; and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat polyclonal antibodies to rat IgG were from Molecular Probes. The mAb 9E10 to the Myc tag and mAb 12CA5 to the HA tag were purified from the culture supernatants of mouse hybridoma cells. Purification of SHPS-1-binding Proteins—All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The entire brain from one male mouse (12 weeks of age) was disrupted in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (100 units/ml), 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate) with a Polytron homogenizer. The crude extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the resulting supernatant (protein, 10 mg/ml) was incubated for 3 h in a 15-ml tube on a gently rotating platform with protein G-Sepharose beads (500 μl of beads) (Amersham Biosciences) that had been covalently coupled with 500 μg of the mAb to mouse SHPS-1. The beads were then washed four times with buffer A and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of acidic buffer containing 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5). Fractions (1 ml each) were collected, neutralized by the addition of 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and subjected to dot-immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies to SHPS-1. Two peak fractions containing SHPS-1 were combined and concentrated with a Centricon 30 (Amicon) filtration device to a final volume of 50 μl. Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel and stained with silver. Bands of interest were excised from the gel, washed in a solution comprising acetonitrile and 100 mm NH4HCO3 (1:1, v/v), and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were then extracted with a solution of 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid, lyophilized, resuspended in 0.1% acetic acid, and analyzed with an LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source and an HP1100 liquid chromatography system (ThermoQuest). Peptide sequences were identified by searching the NCBI nonredundant sequence data base with the obtained tandem mass spectra with the use of Mascot software (Matrix Science). Immunoprecipitation, Lectin Binding, and Immunoblot Analysis— Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (100 units/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants (protein, ∼5 mg/ml) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with antibody-coupled protein G-Sepharose beads. Alternatively, the supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 with agarose beads conjugated with Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (EY Laboratories). Both types of beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer, suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with various antibodies and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Analysis—All procedures were performed at room temperature. Cells seeded on glass coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, and incubated with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. Cells were then permeabilized for 2 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) before incubation first for 1 h in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% FBS, and 0.5% BSA and then for 1 h with mAb 9E10 to the Myc tag. After washing twice with PBS containing 0.5% BSA, the cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min, washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% BSA, and examined with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad model MRC-1024). Flow Cytometry—Detached cells (0.5 × 106 to 1 × 106) were washed with buffer B (PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and 2% FBS) and then incubated with the mAb to mouse SHPS-1 (20 μg/ml) or with control rat IgG (20 μg/ml) for 1 h on ice. They were washed with buffer B and incubated for 1 h on ice with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (10 μg/ml). The stained cells were washed twice, suspended in 1 ml of buffer B, and then analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were processed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). SHPS-1 Forms a Complex with NFB42 and Skp1 in Vivo— SHPS-1 is particularly abundant in the central nervous system (4Sano S. Ohnishi H. Omori A. Hasegawa J. Kubota M.

We therefore adopted an immunoaffinity approach to isolate proteins that interact with SHPS-1 in the brain. A detergent-solubilized extract of mouse brain was applied to protein G-Sepharose beads that had been coupled with a mAb that reacts with the extracellular portion of mouse SHPS-1 (24Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After extensive washing of the beads, bound material was eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by silver staining (Fig. 1A). Bands corresponding to polypeptides that copurified with SHPS-1 were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. The peptide sequences so obtained were used to search the NCBI sequence data base with Mascot software. Data base searches revealed that peptide sequences derived from proteins of ∼40 and ∼20 kDa were identical to sequences of rat NFB42 (AF098301) (19Erhardt J.A. Hynicka W. DiBenedetto A. Shen N.

NFB42 and Skp1 were shown previously to interact directly through the F box domain of the former (19Erhardt J.A. Hynicka W. DiBenedetto A. Shen N. Stone N. Paulson H. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35222-35227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that they associate with SHPS-1 as a complex. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that NFB42 and Skp1 associate with SHPS-1 in mouse brain extract, although Skp1 was barely detectable in immunoprecipitates prepared with a mAb that reacts with the cytoplasmic region of human SIRPα1 (Fig. 1B). Endogenous SHPS-1 was also coprecipitated with antibodies to NFB42 (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analysis also revealed that an immortal line of mouse pigmented melanocytes, Melan-a (26Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), expresses SHPS-1, NFB42, and Skp1 at levels similar to those observed in mouse brain extract (Fig. 1B). A substantial proportion of endogenous NFB42 was associated with SHPS-1 in Melan-a cells, although this proportion was markedly less than that apparent in mouse brain. Skp1 interaction with SHPS-1 was not detected in these cells. The interaction between SHPS-1 and NFB42 was also demonstrated in CHO cells transiently expressing recombinant SHPS-1 and HA-tagged NFB42 (Fig. 1D); NFB42 associated preferentially with immature forms of SHPS-1 in these cells, hardly interacting at all with the mature forms (Fig. 1D). Structural Requirements for SHPS-1-NFB42 Interaction— Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis with a brain extract prepared from mice expressing an SHPS-1 mutant that lacks most of the cytoplasmic region (15Inagaki K. Yamao T. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fukunaga K. Takada T. Hosooka T. Akira S. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6721-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) revealed that NFB42 and Skp1 each associated with the mutant protein, albeit to a lesser extent than with wild-type SHPS-1 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the extracellular or membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 mediates the interaction with NFB42. We next examined the ability to interact with NFB42 of SHPS-1 mutants in which two juxtamembrane lysine residues in the cytoplasmic region were replaced by asparagine and glutamine, respectively, or in which all four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues were changed to phenylalanine. Each of these mutant proteins associated with HA-tagged NFB42 in CHO cells to an extent similar to that observed with wild-type SHPS-1 (Fig. 2B). Thus, neither the positively charged juxtamembrane region nor cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of SHPS-1 appeared to play a major role in the interaction of this protein with NFB42. To map the SHPS-1-binding site in NFB42, we employed the following three NFB42 mutant proteins: NFBΔP, which lacks the NH2-terminal PEST domain; NFBΔPΔF, which lacks both the PEST and F box domains; and NFBPF, which comprises only the PEST and F box domains (Fig. 2C). The HA-tagged versions of these mutant proteins were transiently expressed in CHO cells that stably express wild-type mouse SHPS-1 (CHO-mSHPS-1 cells) and were then tested for their ability to interact with SHPS-1. NFBΔP and NFBΔPΔF, but not NFBPF, bound to SHPS-1 (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the COOH-terminal domain of NFB42 mediates this interaction. Consistent with previous observations (19Erhardt J.A. Hynicka W. DiBenedetto A. Shen N. Stone N. Paulson H. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35222-35227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), NFBΔP, but not NFBΔPΔF, also bound Skp1. SCFNFB42 Ubiquitin Ligase Mediates Polyubiquitination and Proteasomal Degradation of Immature SHPS-1—SCF-type ubiquitin ligase (E3) complexes include the invariant component Skp1, an F box protein that is responsible for substrate recognition, and Cullin1, which serves as a scaffold for organization of the other subunits (27Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Both NFB42 (Fig. 3A) and Skp1 (Fig. 3B) interact with Cullin1, suggesting that these three proteins constitute an SCFNFB42 ubiquitin ligase. Ectopic expression of NFB42 in CHO-mSHPS-1 cells revealed polyubiquitination of SHPS-1 in the presence of the specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 3C). Treatment of cells with MG132 also substantially increased the amount of immature SHPS-1 associated with NFB42 (Fig. 3D). Together, these results suggested that SCFNFB42 acts as an E3 that catalyzes the polyubiquitination of immature SHPS-1 and that the ubiquitinated protein is subsequently eliminated by proteasomal degradation. SHPS-1 Is a Substrate for ER-associated Degradation—The possibility that SCFNFB42-mediated degradation down-regulates the biological function of SHPS-1 appeared unlikely given the lack of a positive effect of MG132 on the abundance of mature SHPS-1 (Fig. 3D). Rather, the selective association of immature forms of SHPS-1 with NFB42 suggested a role for SCFNFB42 in the elimination of SHPS-1 molecules misfolded during biosynthesis. To test this possibility, we determined whether SHPS-1 serves as a substrate for ER-associated degradation (ERAD), a pathway by which misfolded proteins in the ER are translocated to the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome (28Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 29Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 30Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy of Melan-a cells expressing a fusion construct of SHPS-1 and GFP (SHPS-1-GFP) revealed that the recombinant protein was localized predominantly to both the cell surface and the perinuclear region (Fig. 4A). A small proportion of SHPS-1-GFP was also detected as small aggregates throughout the cytoplasm. Similar analysis of cells exposed to MG132 showed that most SHPS-1-GFP was present either in large aggregates adjacent to the nucleus (Fig. 4B) or in small aggregates in the cytoplasm (data not shown). The large perinuclear aggregates exhibited the characteristic features of aggresomes, cellular inclusion bodies that consist of polyubiquitinated proteins and which are formed by ERAD substrates in response to inhibition of proteasome activity (31Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 32Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Our results thus suggested that SHPS-1 is a substrate for the ERAD pathway. SCFNFB42 Promotes Elimination of Misfolded SHPS-1 by the ERAD Pathway—Wild-type NFB42 was distributed diffusely in the cytosol of Melan-a cells incubated in the absence (data not shown) or presence (Fig. 4G) of MG132. Overexpression of wild-type NFB42 induced redistribution of a substantial proportion of SHPS-1-GFP to the cell surface and markedly suppressed the formation of aggresome-like bodies and cytoplasmic aggregates in cells treated with MG132 (Fig. 4C; data not shown). In contrast, expression of NFBΔPΔF, which does not form a functional ubiquitin ligase, promoted the formation of these structures (Fig. 4D; data not shown), indicative of a dominant negative effect of this mutant. The staining of wild-type NFB42 overlapped partially with SHPS-1-GFP fluorescence in a reticular pattern throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4I), consistent with colocalization of these proteins at or in the ER. However, extensive colocalization of the two proteins was not detected at"

In support of the specificity, Gal3ST-2 activity toward the Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ unit on mucin core-2 as well as the Globo H precursor could be inhibited competitively by Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(3-O-sulfoGalβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn but not 3-O-sulfoGalβ1,-4GlcNAcβ1,6(Galβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn. Remarkably these sulfotransferases were uniquely specific for sulfated substrates: Gal3ST-3 utilized Galβ1,4(6-O-sulfo)-GlcNAcβ-O-Al as acceptor, Gal3ST-2 acted efficiently on Galβ1,3(6-O-sulfo)GlcNAcβ-O-Al, and Gal3ST-4 acted efficiently on Galβ1,3(6-O-sulfo)GalNAcα-O-Al. Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ stimulated the activities of Gal3ST-2, whereas only Mg2+ augmented Gal3ST-3 activity.

The fine substrate specificities of Gal3STs indicate a distinct physiological role for each enzyme. Sulfate groups located at various defined positions in glycoconjugates are thought to play crucial roles in biological processes. For example, a sulfated Lewis x determinant has been identified to be a major structural motif in mucins isolated from a nude mice xenograft tumor produced by the human colon carcinoma LS174T-HM7 cell (1Capon C. Wieruszeski J.M. Lemoine J. Byrd J.C. Leffler H. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31957-31968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is suggested that this sulfated determinant may contribute to the high metastatic potential of this cell. A monoclonal antibody evoked to high molecular weight salivary mucins recognizes the epitope 3-O-sulfoGalβ1,3GlcNAc in mucinous epithelia of salivary glands, colon, and uterine cervix, but this epitope is not detectable in healthy stomach, breast, and small intestine (2Veerman E.C. Bolscher J.G. Appelmelk B.J. Bloemena E. van den Berg T.K. Nieuw Amerongen A. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, a tissue-specific distribution of sulfated glycans is noted. A novel cell substrate recognition phenomenon was demonstrated in the interaction between the lectin domains of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and cells expressing sulfated glycolipids (3Miura R. Aspberg A. Ethell I.M. Hagihara K. Schnaar R.L. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11431-11438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is suggested that such molecular recognition may contribute to cell adhesion and migration. Carbohydrate sulfation has been shown to be important for the formation of ligands that bind adhesion molecules belonging to the selectin family (4Hemmerich S. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12035-12047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 5de Graffenried C.L. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol.

Studies that examine the ability of sulfated carbohydrates to inhibit selectin-ligand recognition also highlight the importance of sulfation to human health. Polymers displaying the selectin recognition epitopes 3′,6-disulfo Lewis x and 3′,6′-disulfo Lewis x inhibited L-selectin binding to heparin under static cell-free binding conditions with similar efficacies; however, under the conditions of shear flow, only the polymer displaying 3′,6-disulfo Lewis x inhibited the rolling of L-selectin-transfected cells on the glycoprotein ligand glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (6Sanders W.J.

Binding inhibition assays utilizing paucivalent L-selectin also identified 3′,6-sulfo Lewis x and 3′-sulfo Lewis a as potent inhibitors of L-selectin binding (7Galustian C. Lubineau A. le Narvor C.

In our studies, we have also found that substitution of a sialyl group with a sulfate group in GalNAcβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAcβ1,6(NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3)-GalNAcα-O-Me reduced considerably its inhibitory potential of L- and P-selectin binding (8Jain R.K.

Specifically, while enzymes from colon cell lines and colon tissue prefer to sulfate the C-3 position of Gal in the Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ- moiety of the mucin core-2 structure (Fig. 1), breast cancer cells prefer the Galβ1,3GalNAcα- moiety. In similar biochemical studies, we also observed that prostate carcinoma cell LNCaP has α1,2-l-fucosyltransferase activity that exhibits 4-fold higher activity toward Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ- compared with the Gal residue on the mucin core-2 β1,3 branch (11Chandrasekaran E.V. Chawda R. Locke R.D. Piskorz C.F. Matta K.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This enzyme also acted on the cancer antigen Globo H backbone Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-very efficiently (Fig. 1). Similar to the activity of the fucosyltransferase enzyme, we have observed that a cloned α2,3-sialyltransferase, ST-3GalIV, utilized both the Globo H backbone and the Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ- structure in the core-2 tetrasaccharide. 2E.

The possibility that the Gal:3-O-sulfotransferase from colon tissue, similar to the α1,2-l-fucosyltransferase and α2,3-sialyltransferase, also acts on the Globo H antigen remains undetermined, and we tested this here.

These studies have led us to identify novel, high affinity, and specific acceptors for each of these enzymes, suggesting that each enzyme has a distinct physiological role. Cell Culture—Human colon carcinoma LS180 and Chinese hamster ovary CHO-S cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). LS180 was grown in 2-liter roller bottles in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B). Harvested cells were stored frozen at –20 °C prior to Gal3ST purification. CHO-S was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in tissue culture incubators.

Honke (Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan), K. Uchimura (Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan) and A. Seko (Sasaki Institute, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. For protein expression, CHO cells in 6-well plates at subconfluency were transiently transfected with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen)/well along with 6 μg/ml of one of the above plasmids. The cells were passed into T75 flasks 1 day after transfection, cultured for 3 days, then harvested, and kept frozen at –20 °C until use. Purification of Gal:3-O-Sulfotransferase from LS180 Cells—5.5 × 109 LS180 cells were homogenized in a Dounce all-glass hand-operated grinder with 60 ml of 0.1 m Tris maleate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 30 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% NaN3 and then stirred for 2 h at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to chromatography on a 25-ml bed volume of Aleuria aurantia lectin-agarose (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) column, which had been washed and equilibrated with the above buffer. After entry of the sample into the column bed, the column was washed with 60 ml of the buffer. The bound proteins were eluted sequentially with 100 ml each of 0.5 m fucose and 2.0 m NaCl in the same buffer. Both eluates were concentrated separately by Amicon ultrafiltration using PM10 membranes to a small volume and dialyzed against 2 liters of the buffer with five changes in the cold room for 48 h. The concentrated and dialyzed fucose-eluted fraction (10 ml) was then applied to a 10-ml bed volume affinity gel-GDP (Calbiochem) column equilibrated with the same buffer. The affinity column was washed with 20 ml of the buffer and then eluted with 30 ml of 2 m NaCl in the same buffer. The NaCl eluate was concentrated and dialyzed as above. This preparation (3 ml) was further purified on a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (2.5 × 118.0 cm) at 4 °C, equilibrated, and eluted with 0.1 m Tris maleate, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3. Fractions of 2 ml at a flow rate of 6 ml/h were collected, and 10 μl of alternate fractions were assayed for sulfotransferase activity using Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(3-O-MeGalβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn as the acceptor. The enzyme activity emerged as a single peak from the column soon after the void volume. The fractions under this peak were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against the extraction buffer. This fraction (0.8 ml) was stored frozen at –20 °C and used for enzymology studies. RT-PCR to Identify Sulfotransferase Genes in LS180 —Total RNA extracted from LS180 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was subjected to RT-PCR using Superscript one-step RT-PCR with platinum Taq (Invitrogen). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primers at 42 °C for 1 h and then subjected to PCR using Taq DNA polymerase. Two sets of primers were designed for PCR amplification. The first set corresponded to the amino acid sequences FLKTHKT, FLKTHKS, DESLVLLR, and DESLVLLA, which are conserved among all cloned Gal3STs. The sense primers corresponding to these sequences were 5′-TTCCTGAAGACTCACAAGACG-3′ and 5′-TTCCTGAAGACACATAAATCC-3′, and the antisense primers used were 5′-CCGCAGCAGCACTAGCGACTCGTC-3′ and 5′-TGCCAGCAGAACCAATGACTCATC-3′. The second set of primers were designed against the PAPS binding domain of the cloned Gal3STs corresponding to the amino acid sequence, either HKTASSTV and LRNPVFQLESSFI or HKSGSSSV and RDPAALARSAF. One set of primers for this was 5′-CACAAGACGGCCAGCAGCACGGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTAGATGAAGGAGGACTCCAGCTGGAACACGGGGTTCCT-3′ (antisense), and the other set was 5′-ATAAATCCGGGAGCAGCTCTGTGCTGAGCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGAGCGAGCCAGAGCCGCTGGGTCTCG-3′ (antisense). PCR was performed in all cases using the denaturation temperature of 94 °C, annealing temperature of 58 °C, and extension temperature of 72 °C. RT-PCR products were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination method to determine the sulfotransferase mRNA in LS180.

Assay of Sulfotransferase—The incubation mixture run in duplicate contained 100 mm Tris maleate, pH 7.2, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm British anti-Lewisite, 7.5 mm acceptor, 0.5 μCi of [35S]PAPS (2.4 Ci/mmol), and the enzyme in a total volume of 20 μl unless otherwise stated. The control incubation mixtures contained everything except the acceptor. Incubation was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C. Under our assay conditions, for all acceptors and enzymes tested, less than 25% of the donor [35S]PAPS was utilized. 35S enzymatic transfer was in the linear range for the first 2 h, and it reached maximum incorporation at 5–6 h. Similar observations were made by us in our earlier studies (9Chandrasekaran E.V. Jain R.K. Vig R. Matta K.L. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Chandrasekaran E.V. Jain R.K. Rhodes J.M. Chawda R. Piskorz C. Matta K.L. Glycoconj.

The incubation mixture was diluted with 1.0 ml of water and passed through Dowex-1-X8 (200–400 mesh, chloride form) of 1-ml bed volume in a Pasteur pipette. The column was washed twice with 1.0 ml of water. A quantitative elution of the radioactive product (the 35S-sulfated compound) was achieved by eluting the column with 3.0 ml of 0.2 m NaCl. The radioactivity present in the NaCl eluate was measured using 3a70 scintillation mixture (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) and a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. The 0.2 m NaCl from the control reaction mixture (containing no acceptor) contained a negligible amount of radioactivity (<50 cpm) in all cases. The values for the duplicate runs did not vary by more than 5%. The 35S-sulfated compound resulting from sialylated or sulfated synthetic acceptor was quantitated by TLC method using CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O (5:4:1, v/v) as the solvent system (9Chandrasekaran E.V.

Identification of the 35S-Sulfated Compound Arising from the Acceptor Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me by the Action of LS180 Sulfotransferase—A 10-fold standard reaction mixture (200 μl) containing Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with purified enzyme. After dilution with 1.0 ml of water, it was fractionated by the Dowex-1-Cl method. The 0.2 m NaCl eluate was lyophilized to a small volume (1 ml) and desalted on a Biogel P2 column (1.0 × 116.0 cm) using 0.1 m pyridine acetate, pH 5.4, as the eluting buffer. The radioactive fractions emerging first as a major peak were pooled, lyophilized to dryness, and dissolved in 200 μl of water. A small aliquot was subjected to TLC (silica gel GHLF, 250 μm scored 20 × 20 cm, Analtech) using 1-propanol:NH4OH (25%):water (60:10:25, v/v) along with authentic Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me and 3-O-sulfoGalβ1,-3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me as reference compounds. The reference compounds were located on TLC plates by spraying with sulfuric acid in ethanol and heating at 100 °C. The radioactive compound was located by scraping 0.5-cm-wide segments of the silica and soaking in 2.0 ml of water followed by liquid scintillation counting. Effect of Divalent Metal Ions on Gal:3-O-Sulfotransferases—For studying the effect of divalent metal ions, the incubation mixture contained varying concentrations (0–50 mm) of magnesium acetate, manganese acetate, or calcium acetate under the standard incubation conditions. Testing for Competitive Inhibition—For studying the competitive inhibition by the acceptors on Gal:3-O-sulfotransferases, we took advantage of the fact that the radioactive product arising from the monosulfated compounds 3-O-sulfoGalβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(Galβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn and Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(3-O-sulfoGalβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn cannot be eluted, whereas the product from the neutral acceptors can be eluted from the Dowex-1-Cl column by 0.2 m NaCl. For these runs, the concentration of the neutral acceptor was left constant (6 mm) and that of the sulfated compound was varied from 0 to 7.5 mm under the standard conditions. Gal3ST was purified from LS180 cells using a series of chromatography steps (Table I). The enzyme was purified 750-fold with a recovery of 40% using the three steps of Triton X-100 solubilization, A. aurantia lectin-agarose chromatography, and fractionation on affinity gel-GDP. When this purified preparation was further subjected to chromatography on a Sephacryl S-100 HR column, we obtained a single peak of activity (data not shown) emerging from the column soon after the void volume as measured with blue dextran 2000 but prior to our bovine serum albumin standard (molecular mass, 66,000 Da). The enzyme at this stage was purified 3000-fold with 30% recovery of activity. The enzyme exhibited a relatively low specific activity of ∼700 milliunits/mg suggesting that it was only partially purified, and this was confirmed by silver staining of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the partially purified fraction (data not shown). GlcNAc:6-O-sulfotransferase activity is not exhibited by sulfotransferases in LS180 cells (10Chandrasekaran E.V. Jain R.K. Rhodes J.M. Chawda R. Piskorz C. Matta K.L. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and this was the case for our fraction as well. Further, as shown below, the partially purified enzyme exhibited activity that resembled only one of the three cloned Gal3STs studied in the current work suggesting that it contains only one Gal3ST.Table IPurification of Gal3ST from human colon carcinoma LS180 cellsFractionVolumeTotal proteinEnzyme activitya1 milliunit is defined as the transfer of 1 nmol of sulfate from [35S]PAPS to the acceptor Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(3-O-MeGalβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn (7.5 mm) catalyzed by Gal:3-O-sulfotransferase in 1 h at 37|°C.Enzyme specific activitya1 milliunit is defined as the transfer of 1 nmol of sulfate from [35S]PAPS to the acceptor Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(3-O-MeGalβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn (7.5 mm) catalyzed by Gal:3-O-sulfotransferase in 1 h at 37|°C.-Fold purificationRecovery of enzyme activitymlmgmilliunitsmilliunits%1.

Open table in a new tab The activity of the purified LS180 Gal3ST was examined using a series of acceptors based on the core-2 mucin structure (Table II). This enzyme was poorly active with Galβ1,3GalNAcα-O-Al (20.2% activity as compared with its activity toward Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(3-O-MeGalβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn) and the mucin core-2 analog 3-O-MeGalβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(Galβ1,3)-GalNAcα-O-Bn (15.9% activity), thus suggesting that it preferred to sulfate the Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ unit on the core-2 mucin. In further support of this, it was noted that Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6-(Galβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn was a comparable acceptor to Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(3-O-MeGalβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn (activities 95.6 and 100.0%, respectively). Galβ1,3(GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAcα-O-Bn showed low activity (8.7%), and as anticipated 3-O-MeGalβ1,3(GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAcα-O-Bn was an inactive acceptor. Together the above data suggest that the enzyme has very low affinity for the β1,3-linked Gal moiety in mucin core-2, and it is devoid of GlcNAc:sulfotransferase activity. It prefers to act on the β1,4-linked Gal in the mucin core-2 structure.Table IIThe Globo H structure and its 6-deoxy analog are better acceptors than the mucin core-2 structure for colon carcinoma LS180 Gal3STAcceptor (7.5 mm)Activity of the purified LS180 Gal:3-O-sulfotransferase%Acceptors based on mucin core-2 structure 3-O-MeGalβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(Galβ1,3)GalNAcα-O -Bn15.9 Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(3-O-MeGalβ1,3)GalNAcα-O -Bn100.0 (59,970)aValue in parentheses is the activity in cpm of the reference acceptor (100% activity) against which all other acceptors were compared.

Blank samples (without any acceptor) were of less than 50 cpm, and this corresponds to 0% activity. Open table in a new tab The acceptors containing the Globo H precursor structure Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Al and Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me served as better acceptors for the enzyme than the LacNAc moiety in mucin core-2. An analog of this structure, Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ-O-Me, and another acceptor, Galβ1,4-Glcβ1,6GalNAcα-O-Bn, exhibited very low activities (20.6 and 5.0%, respectively). We synthesized a compound by substituting d-Fuc for d-Gal in the acceptor structure Galβ1,3-GalNAcβ1,3β1,3Galα-O-Me; this is equivalent to converting the Gal moiety to its 6-deoxy derivative. The newly synthesized compound d-Fucβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me was even better than Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me as an acceptor (activities 180.5 and 159.3%, respectively). These results indicate that sulfation does not take place on the C-6 hydroxyl of Gal, and further a free OH on C-6 of Gal is not a requirement for substrate binding of the enzyme. TLC experiments were conducted to determine that the purified enzyme transferred sulfate to the C-3 hydroxyl of the terminal Gal moiety in Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα (Fig. 2). A monosulfated standard compound, 3-O-sulfoGalβ1,3-GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me, was synthesized for this purpose. When the 35S-sulfated product isolated from the action of LS180 sulfotransferase on Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me was subjected to TLC (Fig. 2) along with the synthetic sulfated standard, it was found that the mobility of the radioactive product coincided with that of the synthetic sulfated compound. Thus, based on the combined results from Table II and Fig. 2, it has been tentatively identified that sulfation by LS180 Gal3ST takes place at the C-3 OH of the terminal Gal moiety in the Globo H precursor. We used an array of carbohydrate acceptors to determine the detailed specificity of the cloned Gal3STs (Table III). As seen, both Gal3ST-2 and Gal3ST-3 preferred to act on the C-3 hydroxyl group of Galβ1,4GlcNAc rather than Galβ1,3GalNAcα-O-Al. These enzymes efficiently utilized the mucin core-2 acceptor Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(3-O-MeGalβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn and its corresponding non-methylated structure. They also acted to a lesser extent on 3-O-MeGalβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6-(Galβ1,3)GalNAcα-O-Bn (19.4–24.0%) and also on the trisaccharide Galβ1,3(GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAcα-O-Al (45.2–67.9%). The activities of these two enzymes can be distinguished by their action on the Globo H precursor Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα-O-Me in that this was a preferred acceptor for Gal3ST-2 (295.6% active), whereas it was a poor acceptor for Gal3ST-3 (25.8% active).

Two classes of KDO8P synthases have been identified. The Class I KDO8P synthases (e.g. Escherchia coli KDO8P synthase) catalyze the condensation reaction in a metal-independent fashion, whereas the Class II enzymes (e.g. Aquifex aeolicus) require metal ions for catalysis. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) KDO8P synthase, a Zn2+-dependent metalloenzyme, has recently been found to be a Class II enzyme and has a high degree of clinical significance since it is an attractive molecular target for the design of novel antibiotic therapy. Although the presence of a divalent metal ion in Class II KDO8P synthases is essential for catalysis, there is a paucity of mechanistic information on the role of the metal ions and functional differences as compared with Class I enzymes. Using H. pylori KDO8P synthase as a prototypical Class II enzyme, a steady-state and transient kinetic approach was undertaken to understand the role of the metal ion in catalysis and define the kinetic reaction pathway. Metal reconstitution experiments examining the reaction kinetics using Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ yielded surprising results in that the Cd2+ enzyme has the greatest activity. Unlike Class-I KDO8P synthases, the Class II metallo-KDO8P synthases containing Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Co2+ show cooperativity. This study presents the first detailed kinetic characterization of a metal-dependent Class II KDO8P synthase and offers mechanistic insight for how the divalent metal ions modulate catalysis through effects on chemistry as well as quaternary protein structure. 3-Deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonate-8-phosphate (KDO8P) synthase catalyzes the net condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate and d-arabinose 5-phosphate to form KDO8P and inorganic phosphate (Pi).

This is a key enzymatic reaction that controls the carbon flow in the biosynthetic formation of 8-carbon sugar 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonate (KDO). The KDO is an important constituent of lipopolysaccharides found in most Gram-negative bacteria (1Anderson L. Unger F.M. Bacterial Lipopolysaccharides. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1983Crossref Google Scholar) and plays a crucial role in this assembly process (1Anderson L. Unger F.M. Bacterial Lipopolysaccharides. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1983Crossref Google Scholar, 2Inouye M. Bacterial Outer Membrane: Biogenesis and Function. Wiley, New York1979Google Scholar). Because KDO8P synthase is essential for Gram-negative bacteria and not present in mammalian systems, it represents an attractive molecular target for the design of new antibiotics (3Hammond S.M.

The enzyme 3-deoxy-d-arabino-2-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase catalyzes a similar condensation reaction between PEP and erythrose-4-phosphate, a sugar containing one less carbon, to form DAHP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The formation of the DAHP is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the intermediate compounds chorismate and prephenate, which are precursors to the aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, and Trp), catechols, and p-aminobenzoic acid as well as a number of other highly important microbial compounds (5Walsh C.T. Benson T.E. Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1996; 38: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both enzymes, KDO8P synthase and DAHP synthase, catalyze the condensation reactions with the same stereo-facial selectivity with respect to the double bond of PEP and the aldehyde moiety of the monosaccharide substrate (6Onderka D.K.

Previous studies on Escherichia coli KDO8P synthase suggest the presence of an acyclic hemiketal phosphate intermediate, I, as shown in Scheme 1 (13Li Z. Sau A.K. Shen S. Whitehouse C. Baasov T. Anderson K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9938-9939Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of water/hydroxide on C2 of PEP followed by or in concert with the nucleophilic attack of C3 PEP on the aldehyde carbon of A5P.Although there is little or no homology at the level of the primary sequence, the three-dimensional structures of E. coli KDO8P synthase and DAHP synthase have been reported and provide evidence that these two enzymes are not only mechanistically, but also structurally related. Nonetheless, these two enzymes have evolved to use two different strategies to promote catalysis (14Shumilin I. Kretsinger A R.H. Bauerle R.H. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of DAHP synthase is dependent on the divalent transition metal ion such as Mn2+ or Zn2+. The kdsa gene encoding KDO8P synthase has been identified in other bacteria (16Brabetz W. Wolter F.P. Brade H. Planta. 2000; 212: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Subramaniam P.S.

Lett. 1999; 173: 27-33PubMed Google Scholar) and plants (16Brabetz W. Wolter F.P. Brade H. Planta. 2000; 212: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and based on the early observations on the E. coli KDO8P synthase (19Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been found that the enzyme does not require divalent metal ion for catalysis.Recently it was shown, however, that the KDO8P synthase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus and similar species such as Aquifex pyrophilus require divalent metal cofactor for catalysis (20Duewel H.S. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Shulami S. Yaniv O. Rabkin E. Shoham Y. Baasov T. Extremophiles. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), implying that there may be two classes of KDO8P synthases, one metal-independent and one metal-dependent. Thus KDO8P synthase represents one of the first examples where orthologous enzymes differ based on their requirement of the metal cofactor. The x-ray crystal structures of the E. coli and A. aeolicus KDO8P synthases were reported (15Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Duewel H.S. Radaev S. Wang J. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8393-8402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The overall three-dimensional structures of both enzymes are nearly superimposable, and most of their active sites can be overlapped. Three of the four amino acid residues responsible for chelating the divalent metal ion in A. aeolicus KDO8P synthase (His-185, Glu-222, and Asp-233) are nearly in identical positions with His-202, Glu-239, and Asp-250 of E. coli KDO8P synthase. Moreover, by using a phylogenetic analysis of 29 KDO8P synthase sequences it was clearly shown that KDO8P synthase could be divided into two different classes with respect to their requirement for metals (23Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Class I KDO8P synthases, which include the most extensively studied E. coli enzyme, was shown to be metal-independent, whereas the Class II enzymes, which include the A. aeolicus enzyme, were proposed to be metalloenzymes. In fact, according to the above phylogenetic and sequence analysis, KDO8P synthase from Helicobacter pylori was hypothesized to be Class II enzyme, and it was recently found to be a metalloenzyme (24Krosky D.J.

Thus, KDO8P synthase represents a unique example of an enzyme that requires metal ion in one microorganism and does not require metal in other.One of the putative metallo-KDO8P synthases is encoded by H. pylori, an important human pathogen that colonizes the gastric mucosa and can cause gastritis and cause gastric ulcers (25Blaser M.J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1992; 43: 35-145Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 27Hunt R.H. Scand. J.

H. pylori infection was linked to an increased risk of developing some forms of gastric cancer and was classified as a carcinogen (29Eidt S. Stolte M. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1995; 7: 318-321PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stolte M. Meining A. Oncologist. 1998; 3: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). H. pylori KDO8P synthase is reported to be a zinc-metalloenzyme (24Krosky D.J. Alm R. Berg M. Carmel G. Tummino P.J. Xu B. Yang W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The presence of the Zn2+ has been shown to be catalytically important. The enzyme was inactivated by the treatment with metal-chelating agents such as EDTA and PDA. Although a preliminary study of the effect of metal ions on H. pylori KDO8PS has been previously reported (25Blaser M.J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), a detailed mechanistic understanding of this enzyme or other Class II-KDO8P synthases is lacking.Using H. pylori KDO8P synthase as a prototypical Class II KDO8P synthase, a major objective of the present study was to understand the nature of the metal ions at the active site because different metals may have different affinities and coordination geometry toward protein ligands. An ancillary goal was to define the kinetic reaction pathway to serve as a basis for comparison with the metal-independent Class I KDO8P synthases. Accordingly, a detailed kinetic analysis of the H. pylori native and other metal-reconstituted enzymes was investigated. By comparing the steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic parameters of the different metal-reconstituted enzymes, the following questions were addressed. (i) What is the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction? (ii) What is the rate of chemical catalysis? (iii) What is the nature of the metal ions? (iv) What are the mechanistic similarities and differences with Class I KDO8P synthases? The present study provides the first detailed kinetic characterization of a Class II KDO8P synthase. The role of metal ion in catalysis as well as functional similarities and differences with the metal-independent KDO8P synthases are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—A5P (disodium salt), PEP (monosodium salt), and Chelex 100 were obtained from Sigma. Pefabloc serine protease inhibitor was obtained from Fluka. Metal chlorides were obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. In all experiments Millipore nano-Q quality water was used. The water was passed through the Chelex 100 resin. The pH dependence experiments were done in 50 mm Tris buffer at pH > 7.0 and in 50 mm MES buffer at pH < 7.0.Preparation of Radiolabeled [1-14C]PEP and A5P—The [14C]PEP (20 mCi/mmol) was prepared from [14C]pyruvate (20 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using pyruvate phosphate dikinase, obtained as a generous gift from D. Dunaway-Mariano. The radiolabeled PEP was purified by Q-Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of 20 mm to 0.5 m triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The fractions containing radiolabeled PEP were pooled and lyophilized. The lyophilized powder was dissolved in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, to a final concentration of 0.3 mm.The [14C]A5P (3 mCi/mmol) was synthesized enzymatically by using hexokinase (20 mg/ml) and [14C]arabinose (4 mCi/mmol, ICN) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6. The radiolabeled A5P was purified by Q-Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of 20 mm to 1 m triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The fractions containing radiolabeled A5P were pooled and lyophilized. The lyophilized powder was dissolved in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, to a final concentration of 2.3 mm.Purification of H. pylori KDO8P Synthase and Determination of Enzyme Concentration—The H. pylori KDO8P synthase containing kdsa expression plasmid was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Stewart Fischer, AstraZeneca (24Krosky D.J. Alm R. Berg M. Carmel G. Tummino P.J. Xu B. Yang W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A small volume of starter culture was grown overnight with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The small overnight cultures were transferred into 20 liters of LB medium containing ampicillin and were grown at 37 °C until the A600 became 0.5. The culture was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. ZnCl2 was added to the culture to a final concentration of 50 μm, and the culture was continued to grow for another 3 h. The cells were harvested in a Sorvall centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 mm Pefabloc and one Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) per 10 ml of solution at 4 °C. The cell suspension was passed through a French press, and the extract was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The solution was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL 6B ion exchange column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, and the enzyme was eluted using a NaCl gradient of 0–0.4 m. The fractions containing KDO8P synthase were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to 20% saturation of the solution. The solution was then applied to a butyl-Sepharose 4B FF column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 30% ammonium sulfate. A linear descending gradient of ammonium sulfate (30–0%) was applied, and the protein was eluted. Peak fractions containing KDO8P synthase were combined and concentrated using ultrafiltration. The concentrated fractions were then applied into Superdex 200 column, and the fractions were collected. The fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol and then stored at –80 °C with 10% glycerol. The concentration of the KDO8P synthase was determined using a Bio-Rad assay. E. coli KDO8P synthase was expressed and purified as previously described (31Kohen A. Jakob A. Baasov T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Steady-state Assays—The steady-state kinetic experiments for H. pylori KDO8P synthase activity were performed by monitoring the KDO8P synthase-catalyzed decrease in the absorbance of PEP at 232 nm. For all experiments initial rates for the decrease in the absorbance of PEP were measured by varying the concentration of PEP, whereas the concentration of A5P was kept constant at a saturation level. To maintain a saturating level of A5P experiments were performed at 300 μm of A5P (Km of A5P ∼ 39 μm). The initial rate was calculated from a linear least square fit of the decrease in the absorbance of the curve. As expected, the experimental data under the above conditions were attempted to fit typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (see “Results” and “Discussion”). This analysis allows determination of apparent Michaelis constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme activity.Preparation of H. pylori ApoKDO8P Synthase—200 μm of H. pylori KDO8P synthase solution was prepared using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The enzyme was incubated with freshly prepared EDTA (concentration of EDTA was kept 10 times higher than the enzyme) and kept in ice for about 45 min. Then the activity assay of the EDTA-treated enzyme was carried out and found that the enzyme has almost 3–4% activity. The solution was then dialyzed against two changes of 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C.Preparation of Metal-reconstituted H. pylori KDO8P Synthase— Cd2+-reconstituted KDO8P synthase enzyme was prepared by incubating the apoenzyme (200 μm, final concentration) with CdCl2 (concentration of CdCl2 was kept 8 times higher than the apoenzyme) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the mixture was kept in ice for about 30 min. A quick activity assay was done with the CdCl2-treated apoenzyme, and it was found that the enzyme has good activity. The mixture was then dialyzed against two changes of 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. The level of Cd2+ present in the dialyzed sample was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and the analysis showed that 1 mol of Cd2+ was bound with 1 mol of the enzyme (data not shown).The Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+-enzymes were prepared in a slightly different manner. In these cases, steady-state assays were performed by incubating the apoenzyme with different metal chlorides, and the initial rates were determined at a fixed concentration of apoenzyme but with varying concentrations of metal chlorides. The ratio of metal/apoenzyme corresponded to the maximum initial rate (insets of Fig. 4, A and B, are shown as representative figures) was used for further steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic experiments.Fig. 4A, kinetics of a pre-steady-state burst of radiolabeled product (KDO8P) in Cu2+-reconstituted KDO8P synthase. A solution containing apoenzyme (10 μm) preincubated with CuCl2 (300 μm) and [1-14C]PEP (29.3 μm) was mixed with A5P (250 μm) at 25 °C (final concentration after mixing). The reaction was terminated by quenching with 0.4 n KOH, and the formation of radiolabeled product, KDO8P, was monitored by HPLC with radioactive detection. The curve represents a fit to a burst equation with a rate of 1.7 s–1 for the fast phase and 0.3 s–1 for the slower phase. The inset shows the steady-state plot of the initial rate versus [Cu2+]/[apoenzyme]. B, kinetics of a pre-steady-state burst of radiolabeled product (KDO8P) in Co2+-reconstituted KDO8P synthase. A solution containing apoenzyme (10 μm) preincubated with CoCl2 (500 μm) and [1-14C]PEP (29.3 μm) was mixed with A5P (250 μm) at 25 °C (final concentration after mixing). The reaction was terminated by quenching with 0.4 n KOH, and the formation of radiolabeled product, KDO8P, was monitored by HPLC with radioactive detection. The curve represents a fit to a burst equation with a rate of 16.6 s–1 for the fast phase and 1.6 s–1 for the slower phase. The inset shows the steady-state plot of the initial rate versus [Co2+]/[apoenzyme]. C, kinetics of a pre-steady-state burst of radiolabeled product (KDO8P) in Mn2+-and Ni2+-reconstituted enzymes. The concentrations of the apoenzyme, MnCl2, and NiCl2 were 10 μm, 970 μm, and 3.4 mm, respectively. The concentrations of [1-14C]PEP and A5P were 29.3 and 250 μm, respectively. For the maximum activity, the ratios of the concentration of MnCl2 to apoenzyme and NiCl2 to apoenzyme were determined from the steady-state measurements and were found to be 97 and 340 for Mn2+ and Ni2+ enzymes, respectively (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rapid Chemical Quench Experiments—Rapid quench experiments were performed using a Kintek RFQ-3 Rapid Chemical Quench (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX) as previously described (32Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by mixing the enzyme solution (15 μl) with the radiolabeled substrate PEP (15 μl). In all cases the concentrations of the enzyme, substrate, and metal cited are those after mixing and during the reaction. The reaction was then quenched with 67 μl of 0.6 n KOH. It is found that the substrate and products are stable under these conditions. The substrates and products were separated and quantified using anion exchange column coupled with simultaneous radioactivity detection. The HPLC separation was performed on a Mono Q (HR 5/5) anion exchange column with flow rate of 1 ml/min. A gradient separation was employed using solvent A (20 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 9.0) and solvent B (1 m triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 9.0) in a linear gradient program of 100–0% A from 0 to 30 min and 0–100% B from 0 to 30 min followed by re-equilibration. The elution times were 15 and 17.8 min for KDO8P and PEP, respectively. During the HPLC analysis a small amount of cold PEP was always injected as an internal standard because it co-elutes with hot PEP and its elution time can be monitored at 232 nm by UV detector. These conditions were used to analyze the samples generated from the rapid chemical quench experiments.RESULTSH. pylori KDO8P Synthase Does Not Contain Tightly Bound PEP—Previous studies show that E. coli KDO8P synthase, a Class I KDO8P synthase, was isolated with 1 eq of tightly bound PEP, which contributes stability to the enzyme (33Liang P.H. Lewis J. Anderson K.S. Kohen A. D'Souza. F.W. Benenson Y. Baasov T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16390-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether H. pylori KDO8P synthase retained any tightly bound substrates after purification the enzyme was preincubated with either radiolabeled A5P or PEP in the absence of the second substrate. Unlike the Class I KDO8P synthases, no radiolabeled KDO8P peak was found in the HPLC analysis, indicating that this prototypical Class II enzyme does not contain tightly bound PEP substrate. However, reconstitution experiments adding metal to prepare a holoenzyme from the frozen apoenzyme yielded enzyme with a very low specific activity. We were also unable to fully reconstitute the holoenzyme if the apoenzyme was kept for a longer period (2–3 days) at 4 °C. These results indicate that the apoenzyme is less stable upon removal of the metal ions from the native enzyme.Steady-state Kinetics of the Native and Metal-reconstituted Enzymes—The steady-state kinetic experiments of KDO8P synthase-catalyzed reaction were carried out by monitoring the decrease in the absorbance of PEP at 232 nm. Fig 1A shows the steady-state plot of the native enzyme. The data could be best fitted to a sigmoidal equation yielding Km, kcat, and Hill coefficients (n) 2.6 μm, 0.3 s–1, and 2.6, respectively, at pH 7.8. The values of Km and kcat were found in good agreement with the reported values (15Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The data of Fig. 1A was fitted to a hyperbolic equation as shown an inset of Fig. 1A. Fig. 1, B–D, showed the plots of initial rate versus the concentration of PEP for the Cd2+, Cu2+, and Co2+ enzymes, respectively. Insets of Fig. 1, B–D, show that the data were fitted to a hyperbolic equation. However, the same data could be best fitted to a sigmoidal equation yielding n = 4, 2.5, and 2 for Cd2+, Cu2+, and Co2+ enzymes, respectively. The various steady-state kinetic parameters are summarized in Table I.Fig. 1A, steady-state assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The concentrations of the A5P and the native enzyme were kept at 300 μm and 250 nm, respectively. The data were fitted to a sigmoidal equation, giving Km, kcat, and Hill coefficient (n) values of 2.6 μm, 0.3 s–1, and 2.6, respectively. The inset shows the plot with the same data which were fitted to a hyperbolic equation. B, steady-state assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The concentrations of the A5P and the Cd2+-reconstituted enzyme were kept at 300 μm and 40 nm, respectively. The data were fitted to a sigmoidal equation yielding Hill coefficient (n), Km, and kcat values of 4, 5.3 μm, and 1.0 s–1, respectively. The inset shows the plot with the same data. The data were fitted to a hyperbolic equation. C, steady-state assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The concentrations of the A5P and the Cu2+-reconstituted enzyme were kept at 300 μm and 300 nm, respectively. The data were fitted to a sigmoidal equation yielding n, Km, and kcat values of 2.5, 5.8 μm, and 0.1 s–1, respectively. The inset shows the plot with same data. The data were fitted to a hyperbolic equation. D, steady-state assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The concentrations of the A5P and the Co2+-reconstituted enzyme were kept at 300 μm and 300 nm, respectively. The data were fitted to a sigmoidal equation yielding n, Km, and kcat values of 2.1, 7.5 μm, and 0.1 s–1 respectively. The inset shows the plot with same data. The data were fitted to a hyperbolic equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters of KDO8P synthasesEnzymeKmkcatkcat/KmHill coefficientμms-1μm-1·s-1nE. coli KDO8P synthase54.50.9H. pylori Zn2+-KDO8P synthase2.60.30.1152.6H. pylori Cd2+-KDO8P synthase5.31.00.194H. pylori Cu2+-KDO8P synthase5.80.10.0172.5H. pylori Co2+-KDO8P synthase7.50.10.0132.1 Open table in a new tab pH Dependence of the Native and Cd2+-reconstituted Enzymes—The pH-dependent experiments of the native and Cd2+ enzymes were carried out in the pH range 6–9.5.

https://openalex.org/W2064968634,"Because of their limited size and complexity, de novo designed proteins are particularly useful for the detailed investigation of folding thermodynamics and mechanisms. Here, we describe how subtle changes in the hydrophobic core of a model three-helix bundle protein (GM-0) alter its folding energetics. To explore the folding tolerance of GM-0 toward amino acid sequence variability, two mutant proteins (GM-1 and GM-2) were generated. In the mutants, cavities were created in the hydrophobic core of the protein by either singly (GM-1; L35A variant) or doubly (GM-2; L35A/I39A variant) replacing large hydrophobic side chains by smaller Ala residues. The folding of GM-0 is characterized by two partially folded intermediate states exhibiting characteristics of molten globules, as evidenced by pressure-unfolding and pressure-assisted cold denaturation experiments. In contrast, the folding energetics of both mutants, GM-1 and GM-2, exhibit only one folding intermediate. Our results support the view that simple but biologically important folding motifs such as the three-helix bundle can reveal complex folding plasticity, and they point to the role of hydrophobic packing as a determinant of the overall stability and folding thermodynamic of the helix bundle.

Proteins that explore multiple regions of the free energy surface by redesign represent versatile tools for the elucidation of folding mechanisms. Prominent examples of such proteins are the small IgG binding domain of protein G (1Nauli S. Kuhlman B. Baker D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and the formin-binding protein 28 WW domain (2Nguyen H. Jager M. Moretto A. Gruebele M. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3948-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Kinetic folding studies of these proteins revealed that the folding pathway could be substantially changed upon the introduction of mutations in the hydrophobic core. The folding of protein G switched to that of the structurally related protein L, while the free energy surface of the formin-binding protein could be tuned from three-state to two-state kinetics. In the present study, we have chosen a thermodynamic approach and addressed the question of whether a simple folding motif like the three-helix-bundle reveals folding plasticity in terms of different populations of equilibrium folding intermediates upon the introduction of single and double mutations in the hydrophobic core. Investigating the folding of small (<100 amino acids) single domain proteins is especially intriguing. Single domain proteins are generally considered to be fast, two-state folders. However, increasing experimental (3Khorasanizadeh S. Peters I.D. Roder H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 4Capaldi A.P. Shastry M.C. Kleanthous C. Roder H. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and theoretical (5Zhou Y. Karplus M. Nature. 1999; 401: 400-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Boczko E.M. Brooks III, C.L. Science. 1995; 269: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) evidence supports the notion that the folding of these molecules may also proceed via well defined, partially folded kinetic or thermodynamic intermediate states. Recently, we showed that a de novo designed native-like three-helix bundle protein, α3-1, exhibits two partially folded equilibrium intermediate states (7Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14861-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, we use a similar de novo designed three-helix bundle protein (GM-0) as a model system for dissecting its folding energetics and to examine the influence of changes in the packing of the hydrophobic core. The design of GM-0 was based on the classic heptad repeat motif found in coiled-coil proteins and consists of six distinct hydrophobic core layers, each comprising three amino acids. The “mutant” GM-1 carries a leucine to alanine substitution at one of the hydrophobic d positions (L35A), whereas GM-2 has an additional isoleucine to alanine replacement at heptad position a of helix II (L35A/I39A). The introduction of the smaller hydrophobic side chains of Ala was intended to create cavities in the core region of the variant proteins, thus destabilizing their native states and possibly their equilibrium folding intermediates. Remarkably, the present findings indicate that the helix bundle GM-0 populates two equilibrium intermediate states, whereas only one folding intermediate is populated in both hydrophobic core mutants. Reagents—Bis-ANS 1The abbreviations used are: bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid; GdnHcl, guanidine hydrochloride. was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. Predistilled water was filtered and deionized through a Millipore purification system. Protein Synthesis—The design and synthesis of GM-0 was based on that of the previously described de novo designed protein α3-1 (8Johansson J.S. Gibney B.R. Skalicky J.J. Wand A.S. Dutton P.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3881-3886Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with two amino acid replacements at positions 42 (leucine to methionine) and 51 (cysteine to valine). The amino acid sequence of GM-0 is shown in Scheme 1 in single-letter codes. The helical diagram of GM-0 (Scheme 1) depicts the coiled-coil heptad repeat positions a and d and identifies the location of the residues replaced in GM-1 and GM-2. The N terminus of the protein is acetylated, and the C terminus is amidated to avoid charge repulsion. GdnHCl Denaturation—GM-0, GM-1, and GM-2 (5 μm for all proteins) were incubated for 2 h at 23 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 130 mm NaCl, pH 7, in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl. Control measurements showed that no further spectroscopic changes (CD and fluorescence) took place after 2 h of incubation with GdnHCl (not shown). Unfolding was monitored by the loss of CD signal at 222 nm and/or by the red shift of the intrinsic fluorescence emission. Circular Dichroism—Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a model 62 DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ) using 2-mm path length quartz cells, a bandwidth of 1 nm, a scan step of 0.5 nm, and a time constant of 3 s. The cell holder was maintained at 25 ± 0.1 °C. Fluorescence Measurements—Unless otherwise indicated, fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 25 °C on an ISS-PC spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). For intrinsic fluorescence measurements, excitation was at 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 420 nm. Bis-ANS fluorescence was excited at 375 nm, and emission was recorded from 420 to 600 nm. Fluorescence measurements under pressure were carried out in a pressure cell equipped with sapphire optical windows, similar to that originally described by Paladini and Weber (9Paladini Jr., A.A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The temperature of the pressure cell was controlled by means of a jacket connected to a circulating bath. Pressure was increased stepwise in increments of 170 bar, and fluorescence spectra were measured after 10 min of equilibration at each pressure. Control measurements showed that no additional fluorescence changes took place after 10 min at each pressure step. All experiments were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, containing 130 mm NaCl. Unless otherwise indicated, the protein concentration in all experiments was 2 μm (determined using ϵ280 = 5,700 m–1 cm–1), and the concentration of bis-ANS, when used, was 3 μm. At temperatures below 15 °C the windows of the pressure bomb were flushed with nitrogen to prevent water condensation. Fluorescence spectral centers of mass (intensity-weighted average emission wavelengths, λav) were calculated with software provided by ISS Inc. as shown in Equation 1, λav=ΣλI(λ)/ΣI(λ)(Eq. 1) where λ is the emission wavelength and I(λ) represents the fluorescence intensity at wavelength λ. Determination of the Equilibrium Constant and Volume Change of Unfolding—The thermodynamic equilibrium between the native-like state and the unfolded protein is described by the relation depicted in Equation 2, K=α/(1-α)(Eq. 2) where K is the equilibrium unfolding constant and α is the degree of unfolding. The effect of hydrostatic pressure on the unfolding equilibrium can be described by Ref. 7Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14861-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and shown in Equation 3, K(p)=K0exp(pΔV/RT)(Eq. 3) where K(p) is the equilibrium unfolding constant at pressure p, K0 is the equilibrium constant at atmospheric pressure, ΔV is the molar volume change of folding, and R and T have their usual meanings. In the present work, changes in the spectral center of mass of the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the different proteins were used to monitor the degree of unfolding. Shifts in the spectral center of mass were converted into the extent of denaturation (αp) at each pressure according to the following phenomenological relationship (7Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol.

The standard volume change was obtained from the slope of the linear plot of ln (α(p)/(1 – α(p))) versus pressure according to equations 2 and 3, whereas the equilibrium constant at atmospheric pressure was obtained from the intercept on the y-axis in this plot. At constant pressure, the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant for an unfolding transition can be described by the van't Hoff equation in Equation 5, ΔG/T=(1/T)ΔH-ΔS=-RlnKT(Eq. 5) where KT is the equilibrium constant for unfolding at temperature T, and ΔG is the corresponding Gibbs free energy change. From a plot of G/T versus the inverse temperature, the changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) of unfolding can be extracted. Unfolding by GdnHCl—The equilibrium unfolding of GM-0 by GdnHCl, as monitored by the red-shift of the intrinsic fluorescence emission, displayed a sigmoidal profile typical of that expected for a two-state unfolding transition (Fig. 1). Replacement of Leu-35 (GM-1 variant) and Leu-35/Ile-39 (GM-2 variant) by smaller side-chain alanine residues resulted in major decreases in the stabilities of the native-like states of the variants compared with GM-0 (Fig. 1). A number of studies have shown that cavity-creating mutations or packing defects are energetically unfavorable (for examples, see Refs. 10Lim W.A. Farruggio D.C. Sauer R.T.

Leucine to alanine or isoleucine to alanine mutations in the hydrophobic core of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 brought about a decrease of 3.6 kcal/mol in the free energy of the unfolding of the protein (11Jackson S.E. Moracci M. elMasry N. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11259-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), a value that is very similar to the observed decrease in stability of GM-1 in comparison with GM-0 (Table I). Interestingly, the double mutant GM-2 showed only a slight additional decrease in stability as compared with GM-1.Table IThermodynamic parameters for the unfolding of GM-0 and its cavity creating variantsΔGGdnHClΔGpressure (I1)ΔVΔΔVaΔΔV corresponds to the experimentally determined value in the volume change relative to the ΔV of GM-0.Predicted ΔΔVbPredicted ΔΔV values were calculated based on the different van der Waals volumes of the side chains of alanine (40.3 ml/mol), leucine (74.7 ml/mol), and isoleucine (74.7 ml/mol) (27).ΔGcold (I2)kcal/molkcal/molml/molml/molml/molkcal/molGM-06.8 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.1-42 ± 50.5 ± 0.05GM-13.4 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.2-74 ± 123234GM-23.1 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.1-77 ± 73569a ΔΔV corresponds to the experimentally determined value in the volume change relative to the ΔV of GM-0.b Predicted ΔΔV values were calculated based on the different van der Waals volumes of the side chains of alanine (40.3 ml/mol), leucine (74.7 ml/mol), and isoleucine (74.7 ml/mol) (27Richards F.M.

Open table in a new tab Of note is that all three proteins displayed highly cooperative, two-state unfolding transitions without an indication of the existence of equilibrium intermediate states. Analysis of the equilibrium unfolding data with a two-state model yielded Gibbs free energy changes of unfolding of 6.8, 3.4, and 3.1 kcal/mol for GM-0, GM-1, and GM-2, respectively (Table I). Pressure Denaturation of GM-0, GM-1, and GM-2—Application of increasing hydrostatic pressure to GM-0, GM-1, and GM-2 caused pronounced red shifts of the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the three proteins (Fig. 2), indicating increased exposure of the single Trp residue located in the hydrophobic core of the proteins (heptad position a in helix 2) to the aqueous medium. For the three proteins, the spectral centers of mass initially increased with pressure and reached well defined plateaus at high pressures (>3 kilobar in the case of GM-0 and >2 and 1.5 kilobar for GM-1 and GM-2, respectively; Fig. 2). Of note is that the fully unfolded proteins (i.e. in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl) exhibited spectral centers of mass of 355 nm (see Fig. 4), whereas the pressure-denatured states reached plateau values at 342, 348, and 349 nm for GM-0, GM-1 and GM-2, respectively (Fig. 2). Therefore, the pressure-denatured states of these proteins can be interpreted as partially unfolded intermediate states. In addition, the pressure denaturation curves of all three proteins measured at higher concentrations (10 μm; Fig. 2, open symbols) did not exhibit any shifts when compared with the transitions observed at low protein concentrations (2 μm; Fig. 2, closed symbols). These findings support the view that the plateaus of the pressure denaturation curves can be interpreted as equilibrium folding intermediates and rule out possible contributions from protein aggregation. Importantly, the transitions were fully reversible for the three proteins, as indicated by the fact that the spectral centers of mass recovered completely to their original values upon decompression (asterisks in Fig. 2).Fig. 4Fluorescence emission spectra of native-like (▾), pressure-denatured (▵; 3.5 kilobar), cold-denatured (•; 3.5 kilobar, –10 °C), and fully unfolded GM-0 (□) in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cold Denaturation of GM-0, GM-1, and GM-2—It is well known that elevated hydrostatic pressures cause a depression in the freezing point of water (12Bridgman P.W. The Physics of High Pressure. G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., London1931: 233-243Google Scholar). This allowed us to carry out pressure-assisted cold denaturation experiments on GM-0 and its cavity-creating variants in the absence of cryosolvent additives. Fig. 3 shows cold denaturation of GM-0, GM-1 and GM-2 at 3.5 kilobar of pressure as monitored by the red-shifts of their intrinsic fluorescence emission. Decreasing temperature caused a progressive red shift in the fluorescence emission of GM-0, and the spectral center of mass reached a plateau at 347 nm at –5 °C. Comparison of the spectral center of mass of the cold denatured state of GM-0 with that of the fully unfolded protein (in 6 m GdnHCl) revealed a difference of ∼8 nm (Fig. 4), indicating that another equilibrium folding intermediate was stabilized at low temperature. Upon the return of the sample to room temperature, the fluorescence spectral center of mass returned to its original value, reflecting the complete reversibility of the process. Interestingly, the fluorescence emission spectra of GM-1 and GM-2 were unaffected by decreasing temperature, with no red shifts of the spectral centers of mass down to –10 °C (Fig. 3). These results indicate that GM-0 undergoes cold denaturation under pressure, reaching a state that is different from the fully unfolded state, whereas GM-1 and GM-2 do not undergo cold denaturation in the temperature range down to –10 °C. Thermodynamic parameters obtained from cold denaturation data for GM-0 are shown in Table I. Bis-ANS Binding Studies—To further characterize the folding intermediates of the three-helix bundle proteins, we have used the amphiphilic dye bis-ANS. Bis-ANS is a fluorescent probe whose quantum yield increases markedly with the increasing hydrophobicity of the environment. Because of its non-covalent binding to exposed hydrophobic domains on proteins, bis-ANS has been extensively used to probe conformational changes and folding of a number of proteins (for recent examples, see Refs. 7Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14861-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 13Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Surface-exposed hydrophobic domains are frequently found in folding intermediates such as molten globule states. These conformations are characterized by organized, native-like secondary structures but lack well defined tertiary interactions (16Ptitsyn O.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 376-379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For GM-0, the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS increased ∼2-fold in the transition from the native-like to the pressure-denatured state, and an additional marked increase (∼5-fold) occurred in the cold-denatured state (Fig. 5A). A significant blue shift of the emission of bis-ANS was also observed in the cold-denatured state relative to the native and pressure-denatured states (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that the pressure- and cold-denatured states of GM-0 bear features that are typical of molten globule states. By contrast, no significant increases in bis-ANS binding were detected when GM-1 and GM-2 were compressed and subjected to low temperatures under the same conditions (Fig. 5B). It is interesting to note that the individual free energy changes of the transitions to the pressure-denatured states of GM-0, GM-1, and GM-2 and the cold-denatured state of GM-0 are lower than the overall free energy change (ΔGov) obtained from the full unfolding of the three proteins at high concentrations of GdnHCl (Table I). These observations support the idea that equilibrium folding intermediates are stabilized under these experimental conditions. In this work, we investigated the equilibrium unfolding of distinct de novo designed three-helix bundle proteins using hydrostatic pressure and low temperatures to detect the existence of partially folded intermediates. Hydrophobic residues in the core region of GM-0 were mutated to evaluate their contributions to the folding plasticity of the protein. Based on pressure and cold denaturation studies, we conclude that native-like GM-0 populates two partially folded equilibrium intermediate states, whereas the mutants GM-1 and GM-2 (in which specific leucine and isoleucine residues were replaced by alanine residues) reveal only one folding intermediate under identical experimental conditions. It is interesting to compare our findings to those reported for similar experiments on natural proteins. Studies on ubiquitin, a small single-domain protein, revealed an obligatory kinetic folding intermediate stabilized at low GdnHCl concentrations (3Khorasanizadeh S. Peters I.D. Roder H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon replacement of the hydrophobic core residue valine 26 by alanine or glycine, the folding behavior of ubiquitin changed to a cooperative two-state transition (3Khorasanizadeh S. Peters I.D. Roder H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This observation was explained by the destabilization of the folding intermediate in the mutant proteins to such an extent that it was no longer observable. In addition, the authors also predicted that some proteins with apparent two-state folding may exhibit more complex transitions under well chosen stabilizing conditions. Good examples of this situation are the immunity proteins Im7 and Im9 (4Capaldi A.P. Shastry M.C. Kleanthous C. Roder H. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Gorski S.A. Capaldi A.P. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 849-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These four-helix bundle proteins exhibit ∼60% sequence identity to each other but fold by different mechanisms. Kinetic experiments carried out under physiological conditions revealed a productive on-pathway folding intermediate for Im7, whereas Im9 appeared to be a simple two-state folder (4Capaldi A.P. Shastry M.C. Kleanthous C. Roder H. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Extending those studies to acidic pH, however, revealed intermediate states for the folding transition of Im9 as well (17Gorski S.A. Capaldi A.P. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 849-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was concluded that intermediate formation is a general characteristic of immunity protein folding, depending on the range of folding conditions explored. Whereas the above mentioned studies focused on the population or not of kinetic folding intermediates, the literature also holds examples of changes in the folding thermodynamics of proteins upon subtle differences in physicochemical conditions or point mutations (18Sasahara K. Demura M. Nitta K. Proteins. 2002; 49: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Godbole S. Dong A. Garbin K. Bowler B.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Hobart S.A. Meinhold D.W. Osuna R. Colon W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13744-13754Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Equilibrium folding studies of hen egg white lysozyme, for example, revealed an intermediate stabilized in the GdnHCl-induced denaturation at pH 0.9 as evidenced by CD-spectroscopy (18Sasahara K. Demura M. Nitta K. Proteins. 2002; 49: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, (un)folding of lysozyme induced by GdnHCl at a slightly higher pH (2.2) shows a single cooperative transition. Also striking is the effect of a single mutation on the denaturation mechanism of the transcription regulator factor for inversion stimulation; a proline to alanine mutation at a central helix is sufficient to alter the equilibrium folding transition of the 22-kDa protein from two-state to three-state while its biological function is maintained (20Hobart S.A. Meinhold D.W. Osuna R. Colon W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13744-13754Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Application of hydrostatic pressure usually brings about reversible partial unfolding of proteins in aqueous solution, because the unfolded state occupies a smaller volume than the native state. The volume reduction is likely due to electrostriction and to hydrophobic solvation of the unfolded protein, as well as to the existence of packing defects and void volumes in the folded native state (21Mozhaev V.V. Heremans K. Frank J. Masson P. Balny C. Proteins. 1996; 24: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The contribution of electrostriction to the volume change is considered to be relatively small, as most of the charged side chains in proteins are usually surface-exposed in their native states (22Weber G. Drickamer H.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Controversy still exists as to whether the exposure of hydrophobic groups to water brings about negative or positive contributions to the volume change. Early studies based on the transfer of model hydrophobic compounds from non-polar solvents to water concluded that the exposure of buried hydrophobic residues provides a negative volume change (23Kauzmann W. Anfinsen J.C.B. Bailey K. Anson M.L. Edsall M.T. Advances in Protein chemistry. Academic Press, New York1959: 1-66Google Scholar). A decade later, however, Masterton and Seiler presented evidence indicating that interactions between aliphatic groups and water yield a positive ΔV (24Masterton W.L. Seiler H. J. Chem. Phys. 1968; 72: 4257-4262Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent pressure denaturation studies on site-directed mutants of monomeric staphylococcal nuclease in which internal cavity sizes were altered by amino acid substitution support the view that the loss of internal void volume is the major driving force of pressure-induced unfolding (25Frye K.J. Royer C.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Substitution of a central valine to smaller glycine or alanine residues yielded changes in ΔV upon pressure denaturation that were very similar to the differences between the van der Waals volumes of the individual amino acid side chains. A similar conclusion was reached in a recent investigation of the pressure denaturation of two naturally occurring variants of bovine β-lactoglobulin, which differ by the substitution of a valine residue by an alanine residue in the hydrophobic core of the protein (26Botelho M.M. Valente-Mesquita V.L. Oliveira K.M. Polikarpov I. Ferreira S.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2235-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To estimate the expected differences in volume changes (ΔΔV) for the substitution of Leu-35 and Leu-35/Ile-39 residues of GM-0 by alanine residues of GM-1 and GM-2, respectively, we used the van der Waals volumes of the corresponding amino acid side chains (27Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 82: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). As indicated in Table I, the predicted values of ΔΔV for GM-1 and GM-2 were 34 and 69 ml/mol, respectively. In the case of GM-1, this compares well with the experimentally observed volume change of 32 ml/mol, indicating that the solvent inaccessible cavity contributes significantly to the value of ΔV. More complex is the situation for GM-2. Clearly, the experimentally determined ΔΔV of 35 ml/mol is significantly smaller than the predicted value (69 ml/mol) and very close to that of GM-1. Most likely, the hydrophobic core region of GM-2 has adapted to the amino acid substitutions by repacking of the side chains. Side chains in protein cores contact, on average, two or three other side chains, rendering protein cores a multi-body problem (28Eastwood M.P. Wolynes P.G. J. Chem. Phys. 2001; 114: 4702-4716Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, predicting the possible effects of substitutions is rather difficult. In addition, de novo designed proteins seem to be more flexible and malleable than their natural counterparts. For example, NMR analysis of the structure of α3D, a de novo designed three-helix-bundle protein, showed that the protein adjusted in different ways to either alanine to leucine or alanine to isoleucine substitutions at the same position in the hydrophobic core (29Walsh S.T. Sukharev V.I. Betz S.F. Vekshin N.L. DeGrado W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whereas the leucine mutant showed reduced dispersion of the amide backbone and methyl side-chain resonances, the isoleucine mutant yielded well defined chemical shift dispersions, an indicator of native core packing. Cold denaturation has been observed for a variety of native (for examples, see Refs. 30Antonino L.C. Kautz R.A. Nakano T. Fox R.O. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7715-7718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and 31Lassalle M.W. Li H. Yamada H. Akasaka K. Redfield C. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and de novo designed proteins (7Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14861-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14480-14485Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interactions, which are believed to be the major stabilizing forces of protein cores, are destabilized at low temperatures, leading to protein unfolding (33Privalov P.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 281-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Therefore, the partial unfolding of GM-0 at low temperature (Fig. 3) suggests that a hydrophobic collapse step is involved in the folding process. Consistent with the reduced hydrophobic packing of their internal residues, GM-1 and GM-2 did not undergo cold denaturation under the same conditions as GM-0. This shows that even subtle, conservative amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic core may lead to profound changes in the folding mechanism of a protein, including the existence or not of a hydrophobic collapsed folding intermediate in equilibrium. A number of simulation studies of the folding of natural and designed helical proteins are consistent with the idea that single domain proteins can exhibit non-cooperative folding trajectories (5Zhou Y. Karplus M. Nature. 1999; 401: 400-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Boczko E.M. Brooks III, C.L. Science. 1995; 269: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). For example, different folding scenarios have been obtained in simulations in which only the difference between the strength of native and non-native contacts in the protein was manipulated (5Zhou Y. Karplus M. Nature. 1999; 401: 400-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It thus appears that folding can change from a cooperative two-state transition to one that includes up to two kinetic intermediate states. In addition, a rigorous thermodynamic calculation of the folding free energy of a three-helix bundle protein provided a detailed description of an equilibrium intermediate state characterized by strong interactions between two helices before the third helix docks onto this subdomain to complete the fold (6Boczko E.M. Brooks III, C.L. Science. 1995; 269: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The latter study is of particular interest to our findings in that the partial denaturation of GM-0 to the cold denatured state (I2) involves an on-pathway pressure-denatured intermediate (I1). Changes in protein folding pathways can also be rationalized by globally considering the free energy surface (34Gruebele M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Slight modifications in the amino acid sequence of a protein may have a small impact on the topography of the free energy surface. However, different parts of the unfolded free energy basin may be populated upon mutation and folding may follow a different path toward the global energy minimum. If, for example, such an alternative pathway is characterized by an intermediate basin, a two-state folder switches to a three-state folding transition (34Gruebele M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results support the notion that de novo protein design provides a valuable platform for characterizing the equilibrium folding transitions of biologically relevant structured motifs and might eventually also aid in the understanding of misfolding events and protein aggregation phenomena involved in a number of human diseases (35Ferreira S.T. De Felice F.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)."
