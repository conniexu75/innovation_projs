https://openalex.org/W1984395192,"Magnetic separations at very low magnetic field gradients (&lt;100 tesla per meter) can now be applied to diverse problems, such as point-of-use water purification and the simultaneous separation of complex mixtures. High–surface area and monodisperse magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) nanocrystals (NCs) were shown to respond to low fields in a size-dependent fashion. The particles apparently do not act independently in the separation but rather reversibly aggregate through the resulting high-field gradients present at their surfaces. Using the high specific surface area of Fe 3 O 4 NCs that were 12 nanometers in diameter, we reduced the mass of waste associated with arsenic removal from water by orders of magnitude. Additionally, the size dependence of magnetic separation permitted mixtures of 4- and 12-nanometer–sized Fe 3 O 4 NCs to be separated by the application of different magnetic fields."
https://openalex.org/W2154403718,"We report the sequence and analysis of the 814-megabase genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a model for developmental and systems biology. The sequencing strategy combined whole-genome shotgun and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences. This use of BAC clones, aided by a pooling strategy, overcame difficulties associated with high heterozygosity of the genome. The genome encodes about 23,300 genes, including many previously thought to be vertebrate innovations or known only outside the deuterostomes. This echinoderm genome provides an evolutionary outgroup for the chordates and yields insights into the evolution of deuterostomes."
https://openalex.org/W2007513923,"Many signaling, cytoskeletal, and transport proteins have to be localized to the plasma membrane (PM) in order to carry out their function. We surveyed PM-targeting mechanisms by imaging the subcellular localization of 125 fluorescent protein–conjugated Ras, Rab, Arf, and Rho proteins. Out of 48 proteins that were PM-localized, 37 contained clusters of positively charged amino acids. To test whether these polybasic clusters bind negatively charged phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P 2 ] lipids, we developed a chemical phosphatase activation method to deplete PM PI(4,5)P 2 . Unexpectedly, proteins with polybasic clusters dissociated from the PM only when both PI(4,5)P 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P 3 ] were depleted, arguing that both lipid second messengers jointly regulate PM targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1991561423,"Metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes generally coexist in as-grown materials. We present a gas-phase plasma hydrocarbonation reaction to selectively etch and gasify metallic nanotubes, retaining the semiconducting nanotubes in near-pristine form. With this process, 100% of purely semiconducting nanotubes were obtained and connected in parallel for high-current transistors. The diameter- and metallicity-dependent “dry” chemical etching approach is scalable and compatible with existing semiconductor processing for future integrated circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2068329746,"The segmental pattern of the spine is established early in development, when the vertebral precursors, the somites, are rhythmically produced from the presomitic mesoderm. Microarray studies of the mouse presomitic mesoderm transcriptome reveal that the oscillator associated with this process, the segmentation clock, drives the periodic expression of a large network of cyclic genes involved in cell signaling. Mutually exclusive activation of the notch–fibroblast growth factor and Wnt pathways during each cycle suggests that coordinated regulation of these three pathways underlies the clock oscillator."
https://openalex.org/W2030261975,"Nucleic acid hairpins provide a powerful model system for understanding macromolecular folding, with free-energy landscapes that can be readily manipulated by changing the hairpin sequence. The full shapes of energy landscapes for the reversible folding of DNA hairpins under controlled loads exerted by an optical force clamp were obtained by deconvolution from high-resolution, single-molecule trajectories. The locations and heights of the energy barriers for hairpin folding could be tuned by adjusting the number and location of G:C base pairs, and the presence and position of folding intermediates were controlled by introducing single-nucleotide mismatches."
https://openalex.org/W2152104872,"SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase, is considered a key regulator of cell survival and apoptosis through its interaction with nuclear proteins. In this study, we have examined the likelihood and role of the interaction between SIRT1 and Smad7, which mediates transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced apoptosis in renal glomerular mesangial cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that SIRT1 directly interacts with the N terminus of Smad7. Furthermore, SIRT1 reversed acetyl-transferase (p300)-mediated acetylation of two lysine residues (Lys-64 and -70) on Smad7. In mesangial cells, the Smad7 expression level was reduced by SIRT1 overexpression and increased by SIRT1 knockdown. SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of Smad7 enhanced Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1)-mediated ubiquitin proteasome degradation, which contributed to the low expression of Smad7 in SIRT1-overexpressing mesangial cells. Stimulation by TGFβ or overexpression of Smad7 induced mesangial cell apoptosis, as assessed by morphological apoptotic changes (nuclear condensation) and biological apoptotic markers (cleavages of caspase3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase). However, TGFβ failed to induce apoptosis in Smad7 knockdown mesangial cells, indicating that Smad7 mainly mediates TGFβ-induced apoptosis of mesangial cells. Finally, SIRT1 overexpression attenuated both Smad7- and TGFβ-induced mesangial cell apoptosis, whereas SIRT1 knockdown enhanced this apoptosis. We have concluded that Smad7 is a new target molecule for SIRT1 and SIRT1 attenuates TGFβ-induced mesangial cell apoptosis through acceleration of Smad7 degradation. Our results suggest that up-regulation of SIRT1 deacetylase activity is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy for prevention of TGFβ-related kidney disease through its effect on cell survival.

Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) is a class III histone deacetylase with deacetylase activity, depending on intracellular NAD+ concentrations (1Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L.

Furthermore, mammalian Sir2 homolog (SIRT1) has recently been reported to deacetylate not only the lysine residues of histone proteins but also the lysine residues of some apoptosis-inducible nuclear proteins, such as p53 (4Luo J.

Thus, it is conceivable that SIRT1 is a key regulator of cell defense and survival of mammalian cells through the interaction with apoptosis-inducible nuclear proteins. However, the target molecules of SIRT1 that are involved in apoptosis have been not fully elucidated.Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) 2The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; MMC, murine mesangial cell; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, RNA interference; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; rDNA, ribosomal DNA. 2The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; MMC, murine mesangial cell; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, RNA interference; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; rDNA, ribosomal DNA. is a multifunctional signaling cytokine that regulates apoptosis, cell cycle, differentiation, and extracellular matrix accumulation (9Massague J.

Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). In TGFβ-transgenic mice, which exhibit progressive glomerulosclerosis, mesangial cell apoptosis is accelerated in the advanced stage glomerulosclerosis (11Schiffer M. Bitzer M. Roberts I.S.

TGFβ signaling from the cell membrane to the nucleus is mediated and regulated by intracellular effector molecules, referred to as Smads (12Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Among the Smads, Smad7 was originally recognized as an auto-inhibitory downstream molecule for TGFβ signaling (13Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). In addition, Smad7 was also reported to modulate TGFβ-induced apoptosis (14Yamamura Y. Hua X. Bergelson S. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Smad7 mediates TGFβ-induced apoptosis in podocytes (11Schiffer M. Bitzer M. Roberts I.S. Kopp J.B. ten Dijke P. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Clin.

In renal glomerular mesangial cells, TGFβ-induced apoptosis was facilitated by Smad7 overexpression and was inhibited by the antisense oligonucleotide to Smad7 (18Okado T. Terada Y. Tanaka H. Inoshita S. Nakao A. Sasaki S. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 1178-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These reports support the notion that Smad7 mediates TGFβ-induced apoptosis in renal mesangial cells. Therefore, a more precise understanding of the regulation of Smad7 expression in the kidney may lead to the prevention of TGFβ-related pathological changes, including mesangial cell apoptosis and glomerulosclerosis.It was recently reported that E3 ubiquitin ligase smurf1 (Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1)-mediated protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates the level of Smad7 expression (20Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 21Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The acetyl-transferase (p300)-mediated acetylation of two specific lysine residues (Lys-64 and -70) on Smad7 is one of its post-translational modifications and inhibits its degradation by interfering with the Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination, which mediates the stabilization of Smad7 (22Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms for the deacetylation of Smad7 and the correlation between its deacetylation and degradation are yet to be fully understood.These previous results led us to investigate the possibility that apoptosis-associated nuclear protein Smad7 is a new target protein for SIRT1 and that the SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of Smad7 affects the degradation of Smad7. In the present study, we have investigated the capacity of SIRT1 to interact with Smad7 and inhibit TGFβ-induced apoptosis in renal glomerular mesangial cells. The results suggest that SIRT1 up-regulation is a potentially useful therapeutic target to prevent the progression of kidney disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-SIRT1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-cleaved caspase-3 (ASP175), anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (αPARP), and anti-acetyl-lysine antibody (αAc-K) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Protein A/G-agarose and anti-Myc (αMyc) monoclonal and anti-hemagglutinin (αHA) polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β actin, anti-FLAG (αFLAG) M2 monoclonal and lactacystin were from Sigma. Lipofectamine reagent was from Invitrogen. Human recombinant TGFβ1 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-Smad7 (αSmad7) antibody was obtained from IMGENEX (San Diego, CA).DNA Constructs—We generated an expression vector for Myc-tagged wild-type (WT) Smad7 by subcloning the PCR products into the pCMV-Myc expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as previously reported (23Kanasaki K. Koya D. Sugimoto T. Isono M. Kashiwagi A. Haneda M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Point mutants of Myc-tagged Smad7 (K64R, K70R, and K64R/K70R, respectively) vectors and FLAG-SIRT1(H355A) vector were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The various fragments of Myc-tagged Smad7 (amino acids 1–812 (ΔCT) and 590–1280 (ΔNT)) vectors were generated by PCR and cloned into the pCMV-Myc expression vector. FLAG-tagged Smad7 vectors were generated by subcloning into the pFLAG-CMV-6a,b,c expression vector. FLAG-SIRT1 (mouse Sir2α) vector was a kind gift from J. Luo (Columbia University, New York, NY), HA-tagged p300 vector was kindly provided by T. Nakajima (St. Marianna University school of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan), 6× Myc-tagged Smurf1 vector was a kind gift from K. Miyazono (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), and His-tagged ubiquitin vector was kindly gifted by D. Bohmann (University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY).Cell Culture—SV40-transformed murine mesangial cell (MMC) line (MES13 cells) and COS7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), and glucose (100 mg/deciliter).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 1% aprotinin) and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 revolutions/min for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation analysis using nuclear protein extractions of murine mesangial cells, cells were homogenized and lysed with hypotonic buffer (10 mmol/liter HEPES-KCl, pH 7.9, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 15 mmol/liter KCl, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Lewes, UK) with 0.8% Nonidet P-40, and the lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in high salt buffer (hypotonic buffer with 420 mmol/liter NaCl and 25% glycerol), rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were used as nuclear extracts. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by adding the appropriate antibodies plus protein A/G-Sepharose beads followed by incubation at 4 °C for 4 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with the appropriate antibodies, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). After washing, the blots were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown Experiments–GST fusion SIRT1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli transformed with pGEX-SIRT1 and purified by using MagnetGST protein purification according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Promega). GST pulldown assay using in vitro translated Myc-tagged Smad7 proteins was performed. Samples from the GST pulldown were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Smad7 was detected by using αMyc antibody.Retroviral Infection—The pBABE, pBABE-SIRT1, pSUPERretro, and pSUPERretro-SIRT1 RNA interference (RNAi) vectors were previously generated (24Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Machado De Oliveira R. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Retroviral infection was performed as previously described (24Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Machado De Oliveira R. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with pBABE, pBABE-SIRT1, pSUPERretro, or pSUPERretro-SIRT1 RNAi by using Lipofectamine reagent. At 48 h after transfection, the media containing retroviruses were collected, centrifuged, and transferred to MMCs treated by polybrene (1 μg/ml). The infected cells were selected by treatment with puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) for several days.In Vitro Translation—[35S]Methionine-labeled, in vitro translated FLAG-tagged SIRT1 and each Myc-tagged Smad7 (WT, ΔCT, or ΔNT) were generated with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system (Promega), and these proteins were used to perform immunoprecipitation analysis as described previously (25Sif S. Gilmore T.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7612-7617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation results were detected by autoradiography after 16 h at –80 °C.Pulse-Chase Analysis—Myc-tagged Smad7 vector was transfected in the MMCs infected with either pBABE or pBABE-SIRT1 retroviral vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, these cells were incubated for 1 h with 35S-labeled cysteine and methionine (Amersham Biosciences) in cysteine- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were washed and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml cysteine and methionine for the indicated time periods (0, 30, 60, and 120 min) followed by immunoprecipitation using αMyc. Immunoprecipitated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography after 16 h at –80 °C. The amount of 35S-labeled Myc-Smad7 at each point was plotted as the percent of the amount at the start of the chase.RNA Interference—The small interference RNA to mouse Smad7 (5′-CAUCAAGGCUUUUGACUAUGAGAAA-3′) was designed by and bought from iGENE Therapeutics (Tsukuba, Japan). MMCs on a 6-well plate were transfected with Smad7 RNAi using the TransIT-TKO reagent (Madison, WI). After 24 h, cells were treated with TGFβ (5 ng/ml) for 48 h. Levels of Smad7 expression were determined by immunoblot analysis 72 h after transfection.Analysis and Quantitation of Apoptosis—MMCs treated with various concentrations of TGFβ for the indicated time periods (0–48 h) were stained with DAPI for 5 min at room temperature and then examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61; Tokyo, Japan). The staining was performed in five independent experiments for each group, and 30 random fields (∼600 nuclei) were studied in each experiment. Apoptosis was defined as nuclear condensation, and the results were expressed as the percent of apoptotic cell number to total number of nuclei/field. Smad7- or Smad7(K64R/K70R)-induced apoptosis was detected as described below. MMCs were transfected with either Myc-tagged Smad7 or Smad7(K64R/K70R) followed by immunostaining using anti-Myc antibody and DAPI staining. The percentage of Myc-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei was scored 36 h after transfection. Apoptosis was also confirmed by assessing the amount of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, as biological apoptotic markers, by immunoblot analysis.Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance with subsequent Scheffe's test was used to determine the significance of differences in multiple comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSSIRT1 Interacts with Smad7 Both in Vivo and in Vitro—To investigate the general interaction between SIRT1 and Smad7 in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis in transiently transfected COS7 cells using either Myc-tagged Smad7 vector, FLAG-tagged SIRT1 vector, or both of these vectors (Fig. 1, A and B). Myc-tagged Smad7 was detected in the immunoprecipitates with αFLAG of co-transfection (Fig. 1A), and FLAG-tagged SIRT1 was detected in the immunoprecipitates with αMyc of co-transfection (Fig. 1B), indicating that SIRT1 interacts with Smad7 in vivo. We next performed immunoprecipitation experiments in vitro using either in vitro translated FLAG-tagged SIRT1 proteins, Myc-tagged Smad7 proteins, or both of these proteins (Fig. 1C), which provided additional evidence for an interaction between SIRT1 and Smad7 (Fig. 1C). In further immunoprecipitation analysis using the deletion mutants of Myc-tagged Smad7 vectors, SIRT1 was detected in the immunoprecipitates of both Smad7(WT) and Smad7(ΔCT) but not Smad7(ΔNT), indicating that SIRT1 interacts with the N terminus of Smad7 (Fig. 1, D and E). We confirmed a direct interaction between SIRT1 and Smad7 by using GST pulldown assay (Fig. 1F). These findings show that SIRT1 directly interacts with Smad7.SIRT1 Deacetylates the Lysine Residues of Smad7—To confirm that two specific lysine residues (Lys-64 and -70) of Smad7 are acetylated by acetyltransferase p300 (22Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we generated two single-mutated and a double-mutated Smad7 vector in which these lysine residues were mutated to arginine residues (K64R, K70R and K64R/K70R, respectively). In vivo acetylation assays revealed that wild-type Smad7 was acetylated by p300 (Fig. 2A). However, the acetylation of the lysine residues was partially decreased in the single-mutated Smad7(K64R and K70R), and it was completely inhibited in the double-mutated Smad7(K64R/K70R) (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that two specific lysine residues (Lys-64 and -70) of Smad7 were acetylated by p300 as previously reported (22Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether SIRT1 could deacetylate the lysine residues of Smad7. The p300-mediated acetylation of the lysine residues of Smad7 was decreased in SIRT1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2B, lane 3). SIRT1(H355A) was reported to function as a dominant negative mutant and to inhibit the endogenous SIRT1-mediated deacetylation (4Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). SIRT1(H355A) inhibited SIRT1-mediated decreases in the p300-induced acetylation of the lysine residues of Smad7 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that SIRT1 functionally interacts with Smad7, resulting in the deacetylation of the lysine residues of Smad7.FIGURE 2SIRT1 deacetylates lysine residues of Smad7.

To examine the physiological effects of SIRT1 on Smad7 in MMCs, SIRT1 expression in MMCs was modified through retroviral infection with either pBABE-SIRT1 or pSUPER-SIRT1 RNAi for overexpression (10-fold) or knockdown (7-fold), respectively, of the SIRT1 gene (Fig. 3B). The acetylated lysine residues of Smad7 have been reported to protect it against Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation (22Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of SIRT1 in the regulation of Smad7 degradation. The levels of Smad7 expression were significantly decreased in the SIRT1-overexpressing MMCs and were increased in the SIRT1 knockdown MMCs (Fig. 3B). However, SIRT1(H355A) significantly attenuated the decreased Smad7 expression in the SIRT1-overexpressing MMCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and D). To confirm that the decreased amount of Smad7 expression in the SIRT1-overexpressing MMCs was caused by the stimulation of degradation, we performed degradation assays using methionine pulse-chase analysis. This analysis revealed that the degradation of Smad7 was significantly accelerated in the SIRT1-overexpressing MMCs (Fig. 4A). To test the effect of SIRT1 on the ubiquitin-proteasome system in MMCs, we performed ubiquitination assays in the SIRT1-overexpressing and knockdown MMCs. Ubiquitination assays revealed that the ubiquitination of Smad7 was notably increased in the SIRT1-overexpressing MMCs and was decreased in the SIRT1 knockdown MMCs (Fig. 4B). SIRT1(H355A) inhibited the acceleration of Smad7 ubiquitination in the SIRT1-overexpressing MMCs (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the decreased amount of Smad7 expression in the SIRT1-overexpressing MMCs was significantly reversed by lactacystin, known as a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 4, D and E). These findings suggest that SIRT1 enhances the smurf1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of Smad7 in MMCs.FIGURE 3SIRT1 decreases level of Smad7 expression in MMCs.

By screening about 350,000 individuals in two populations from the Volga-Ural region of Russia, we identified a gene mutation in families who show an inherited form of hair loss and a hair growth defect. Affected individuals were homozygous for a deletion in the LIPH gene on chromosome 3q27, caused by short interspersed nuclear element–retrotransposon–mediated recombination. The LIPH gene is expressed in hair follicles and encodes a phospholipase called lipase H (alternatively known as membrane-associated phosphatidic acid–selective phospholipase A1α), an enzyme that regulates the production of bioactive lipids. These results suggest that lipase H participates in hair growth and development."

The role of the multigene PE family of proteins unique to mycobacteria in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis is still poorly understood, although certain PE_PGRS genes have been linked to virulence. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is essential for successfully combating tuberculosis. In this study we provide evidence that PE_PGRS33, a surface exposed protein, elicits TNF-α release from macrophages in a TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2)-dependent manner. ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) is activated downstream of TLR2. ASK1 activates the MAPKs p38 and JNK. PE_PGRS33-induced signaling leads to enhanced expression of TNF-α and TNF receptor I (TNFRI) genes. Mycobacterium smegmatis expressing PE_ PGRS33 elicits the same effects as purified PE_PGRS33. TNF-α release occurs even when internalization of the bacteria is blocked by cytochalasin D, suggesting that interaction of PE_ PGRS33 with TLR2 is sufficient to trigger the effects described. Release of TNF-α plays the determining role in triggering apoptosis in macrophages challenged with PE_PGRS33. The death receptor-dependent signals are amplified through classical caspase 8-dependent mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, leading to the activation of caspases 9 and 3.

Recent studies have shown that TNF–/– mice undergo an uncontrolled expansion of CD4 and CD8 T cells (9Zganiacz A. Santosuosso M. Wang J. Yang T. Chen L. Anzulovic M. Alexander S. Gicquel B. Wan Y.

Considering its central role in defining the course of tuberculosis infection, it is important to understand how the microbe regulates TNF-α induction in the host and how this is related to the regulation of key events such as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Because Mycobacterium tuberculosis resides in macrophages, the course of the infection rests on the outcome of the interaction between the bacterium and the host macrophages. Paradoxically, macrophages provide an intracellular niche for the invading pathogen and also restrict the pathogen by a variety of mechanisms. This duality of function has been analyzed in a recent report by Leemans et al. (13Leemans J.C. Thepen T. Weijer S. Florquin S. van Rooijen N. van de Winkel J.G. van der Poll T. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) who have suggested that the bacterium resides in resting macrophages, whereas activated macrophages deliver the antimicrobicidal arsenal required to limit the pathogen. Apoptosis of resting macrophages is likely to be a part of the immune defense mechanism. Mycobacteria-induced apoptosis of infected macrophages releases mycobacterial antigen-containing apoptotic vesicles. These vesicles are engulfed by dendritic cells, which process the antigenic cargo for subsequent presentation to CD8 T cells (14Winau F. Weber S. Sad S. de Diego J. Hoops S.L. Breiden B. Sandhoff K. Brinkmann V. Kaufmann S.H.E. Schaible U.E. Immunity. 2006; 24: 105-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that TNF-α plays a critical role in modulating apoptosis associated with M. tuberculosis infection. Inactivation of TNF-α is linked to the ability of M. tuberculosis to evade apoptosis of host macrophages (15Balcewicz-Sablinska M.K. Keane J. Kornfeld H. Remold H.G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2636-2641PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rojas M. Olivier M. Gros P. Barrera L.F. García L.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6122-6131PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the above, it is important to dissect the repertoire of mycobacterial molecules delivering TNF-α-dependent pro-apoptotic signals to macrophages, and to understand how mycobacteria may have developed mechanisms to suppress these signals. Eight percent of the coding sequence of the M. tuberculosis genome is dedicated to members of the unrelated PE and PPE gene families, characterized by the presence of N-terminal ProGlu and Pro-Pro-Glu motifs in the respective families (17Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6522) Google Scholar). Linkage of glycine-rich sequences encoded by polymorphic GC-rich repetitive sequences (PGRS) to the C-terminal ends of the PE domains is characteristic of the PE_PGRS family of proteins. Several PE_PGRS proteins are localized on the extracellular surface of M. tuberculosis (18Brennan M.J. Delogu G. Chen Y. Bardarov S. Kriakov J. Alavi M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7326-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 19Sampson S.L. Lukey P. Warren R.M. van Helden P.D. Richardson M. Everett M.J. Tuberculosis. 2001; 81: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One such protein is PE_PGRS33 (encoded by the open reading frame Rv1818c of M. tuberculosis H37Rv) (20Delogu G. Pusceddu C. Bua A. Fadda G. Brennan M.J. Zanetti S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A role of certain PE_PGRS proteins in virulence was suggested by gene inactivation studies in Mycobacterium marinum. Inactivation of two PE_PGRS genes resulted in a replication defect in macrophages and decreased survival in granulomas (21Ramakrishnan L. Federspiel N.A. Falkow S. Science. 2000; 288: 1436-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Global expression profiles have shown that the PE/PPE genes are not regulated as one group, but rather they show variable expression patterns under different environmental conditions likely dictated by different regulatory circuits (22Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger S. Rutherford R. Liu Y. Schoolnik G.K. Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The PE/PPE proteins are therefore likely to fulfill diverse functions in the biology of M. tuberculosis. The host response to infection is initiated by the early response of the innate immune system to an array of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns. It is therefore likely that differences in the virulence of M. tuberculosis could relate to differences in this early response. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (23Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6702) Google Scholar). The diversity of the innate immune response to pathogens is to a large extent generated by the diversity of signaling triggered by the TLRs and their adapters. Given that pathogenic mycobacteria infect professional phagocytes, there has understandably been considerable interest in deciphering how TLR-mediated signals can control the innate immune response to mycobacteria. TLR2-deficient mice have been reported to be susceptible to M. tuberculosis infection (24Drennan M.B. Nicolle D. Quesniaux V.J. Jacobs M. Allie N. Mpagi J. Fremond C. Wagner H. Kirschning C. Ryffel B. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), particularly in a high dose aerosol challenge model (25Reiling N. Holscher C. Fehrenbach A. Kroger S. Kirschning C. Goyert S. Ehlers S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3480-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The complementary approaches of using either individual molecules or the intact bacterium modified in expression of a particular molecule to study effects on host cell signaling in the context of innate immunity contribute toward detailed understanding of immune signaling in response to mycobacterial infection. In this study we have used both approaches to evaluate how one member of the unique PE_PGRS family of M. tuberculosis proteins, namely PE_PGRS33, regulates macrophage signaling. We provide evidence that the induction of TNF-α by PE_PGRS33 occurs in a TLR2-dependent manner and leads to consequent macrophage apoptosis. The apoptotic signals generated by PE_PGRS33-induced TNF-α release are amplified in a mitochondria-dependent pathway. The PGRS domain is responsible for mediating TNF-α release. The PGRS domain of PE_PGRS33 shows a large number of variations in clinical strains (26Talarico S. Cave M.D. Marrs C.F. Foxman B. Zhang L. Yang Z. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 4954-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The most important results of our study reflect that the deletion of some of the PGRS repeats within this domain (simulating the deletions that exist in putative PE_PGRS33 proteins from clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis) impact the TNF-α-inducing ability of the respective proteins. These findings are of potential clinical relevance and suggest that polymorphisms in the PGRS domain help clinical strains of M. tuberculosis modulate the release of TNF-α from macrophages. These modulatory effects could potentially regulate the clinical course of the disease.

The second PCR product was obtained using the antisense primer 5′-ATGAATTCCTACGGTAACCCGTTCATC-3′ and the sense primers shown in Table 1. SA-440 and SA455 variants of PE_PGRS33 (described under Fig. 1) were PCR-amplified using primers described by Talarico et al. (26Talarico S. Cave M.D. Marrs C.F. Foxman B. Zhang L. Yang Z. J. Clin.

A second round of PCR was performed using the respective pUC19 constructs and primer pairs A and B, followed by cloning in pET28a+ as described above. All constructs were verified by sequencing of both strands.TABLE 1Primers used for the generation of deletion constructs of PE_PGRS33Antisense primer for 1st fragmentSense primer for 2nd fragmentMutation5′—ATGGTACCGCCGAACCCTGCGGTG—3′5—ATGGTACCGGGGCCGGCGGGGCCG—3′Δ(Gly-184 to Gly-213)5′—ATGGTACCGGCGCCGTAGAGCAGCCC—3′5′—ATGGTACCGGCGGGGCCGGCGGAG—3′Δ(Gly-196 to Asp-243)5′—ATGGTACCGAGTCCGCCGACGCCG—3′5′—ATGGTACCATCGGATTGGTCGGGAAC—3′Δ(Leu-237 to Gly-327)5′—ATGGTACCGGCGTTGCCGCCCGCCC—3′5′—ATGGTACCGGCCTTCTGTTTGGTACC—3′Δ(Gly-372 to Ala-403) Open table in a new tab Induction of PE_PGRS33 from E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pJSK33 was carried out at 37 °C for 4 h with isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside (250 μm). Cells were harvested, and the cell pellet was resuspended and lysed with Bugbuster HT (Novagen) to which 0.5 mm EDTA and 100 μm Pefabloc was added. Hexa-His-tagged PE-PGRS33 was purified from the soluble fraction by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). All experiments were carried out with the purified PE-PGRS33 produced in E. coli unless otherwise stated. For expression of variant PE_PGRS proteins, E. coli strains Rosetta (Novagen) and C41(DE3) (Avedis, France) were also used. Variant PE_PGRS proteins were purified by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. Cloning and Expression of PE_PGRS33 in HEK293—To generate a Myc-His epitope tag in pcDNA3.1 (–)(Invitrogen), the Myc-His epitope present in pBAD-Myc-HisB (Invitrogen) was amplified using the sense and antisense primers 5′-CGGGATCCGAACAAAAACTCATCT-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTAAGCTGGAGACCGTT-3′, respectively. The resulting PCR product was cloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites (underlined) of pcDNA3.1(–) to generate the vector pcDNA3.1-Myc-His. PE_PGRS33 was amplified by PCR using the primer pairs 5′-TGCTCTAGAATGTCATTTGTGGTCACGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGAATTCATCGGTAACCCGTTCATCC-3′ (antisense). The resulting PCR product was cloned between the XbaI and EcoR1 sites (in boldface) of pcDNA3.1-Myc-His to generate pJSK37. 107 HEK293 cells were transfected with pJSK37 using the Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were rinsed (twice) with ice-cold PBS, scraped off, and homogenized with a 26-gauge needle in 1 ml of buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, aprotinin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm Pefabloc). His-tagged PE_PGRS33 was purified from the cytosolic fraction by chromatography on Ni+2-NTA-agarose. LPS Assay—LPS contamination of the purified protein was determined by Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay using the E-TOXATE kit from Sigma with a sensitivity limit of 0.1 endotoxin unit/ml. Ectopic Expression of His6-PE-PGRS33 in M. smegmatis—Briefly, the His-PE-PGRS33 gene was cloned in a shuttle vector carrying the mycobacterial and E. coli origins of replication under the control of the hsp60 promoter (28Choudhuri B.S. Bhakta S. Barik R. Basu J. Kundu M. Chakrabarti P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to generate pJSK101. For ectopic expression of His-PE_PGRS33, pJSK101 was electroporated into M. smegmatis mc2155. Expression of His-PE-PGRS33 was confirmed by Western blotting of the lysates from exponentially growing M. smegmatis/pJSK101 with anti-His antibody. Challenge of RAW 264.7 with Bacteria—RAW 264.7 cells were infected with M. smegmatis harboring vector alone or pJSK101 expressing PE_PGRS33 at multiplicities of infection of 5, 10, and 20 for various periods of time. Cytochalasin D was used to prevent internalization of bacteria (29Goddette D.W. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15974-15980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with cytochalasin D (5 μm) for 1 h followed by washing three times with PBS before infection with M. smegmatis. To determine the survival of bacteria within macrophages, infected macrophages were washed with PBS and lysed with 0.05% SDS. The lysates were serially diluted and plated on Middle Brook 7H11 agar, and colony-forming units were determined. Isolation of Monocyte-derived Macrophages (MDM)—MDM were isolated as described by Manor and Sarov (30Manor E. Sarov I. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 90-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human peripheral blood monocytes were prepared from heparinized blood of normal healthy volunteers (with informed consent), by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Sigma). Cells from the interface were washed three times, suspended in RPMI 1640 containing HEPES buffer, and incubated in plastic dishes for 2–3 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Adherent monocytes were removed from the plate by gentle scraping. Monocytes obtained were incubated for 7–10 days in RPMI with 10% FBS in a CO2 incubator when 95% of monocytes were converted to MDM. Cell Death—For the detection of histones by ELISA, cells were plated (6 × 104cells/well) on 96-well plates. After treatments, cell death was detected with the cell death detection ELISA Plus kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For measurements of annexin-fluos binding, 100 μl of cells in annexin-fluos binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) were mixed with 2 μl of annexin-fluos. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature, washed with binding buffer, and analyzed by flow cytometry. To assess necrosis, propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) was added to the cell suspension just before analysis. Unless otherwise stated, cell death was analyzed 20 h after challenge with PE_PGRS33 (or PE_PGRS62 or PE_PGRS48). Study of the Interaction of PE_PGRS33 with TLR2—Lysates from RAW 264.7 cells (107 cells/assay) were incubated with Ni2+-NTA or PE_PGRS33-bound Ni2+-NTA-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h with shaking. The beads were washed and boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer for 5 min, and proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-TLR2 antibody to detect His-PE_PGRS33-bound TLR2. In separate experiments, HEK293 cells transfected either with TLR2 or with TLR4 were incubated for 10 min with His-PE_PGRS33. Plates were washed with PBS and scraped out in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Pelleted cells were incubated with rabbit anti-His antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed twice with PBS and 1% BSA and incubated with 2 μg/ml Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG in 250 μl of PBS and 1% BSA for 45 min on ice. Pellets were washed twice, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. 10,000 cells were counted for each condition. Treatment of RAW 264.7 Cells with PE_PGRS33 and Preparation of Cell Lysates—RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates at 4 × 105 cells/well, treated with PE_PGRS33, and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 4 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Pefabloc, and 1 mm benzamidine) on ice for 15 min. Cell lysates were boiled for 5 min after the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting. When performing Western blotting for detection of caspases, cells were pelleted and freeze-thawed three times in 20 μl of cell extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES/NaOH, pH 6.5, containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Pefabloc). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for the detection of caspases. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% (w/v) BSA. After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) (or appropriate secondary antibody) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by development with BM chemiluminescence reagent (Roche Applied Science), and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR5; Eastman Kodak Co.). ASK1 Kinase Assay—This was done as described by Bhattacharyya et al. (31Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Basak C. Law S. Kundu M. Basu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26517-26525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates at 6 × 105 cells/well. After treatment, cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The supernatant (equivalent to 200 μg of protein) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal ASK1 antibody. Protein A/G Plus-agarose was added and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 3 h. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containin"

It has previously been shown that the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 also promotes the conjugation of Nedd8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. We report the identification of FBXO11, a member of the F-box protein family and a component of the Skp1·Cullin1·F-box (SCF) complex, as a new p53-interacting protein. We show that FBXO11 promotes the neddylation of p53 both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to the C-terminal lysine residues, FBXO11 can also promote Nedd8 conjugation to Lys-320 and Lys-321, and neddylation of p53 leads to suppression of p53 function. This is consistent with recent studies showing that a lysine to arginine mutation at Lys-320 significantly enhances p53 function, although Lys-320 was originally identified as an acetylation site involving PCAF-mediated activation of p53. Our study provides an example of an F-box protein acting as an adaptor protein that can mediate the neddylation of a non-cullin substrate.

Our study provides an example of an F-box protein acting as an adaptor protein that can mediate the neddylation of a non-cullin substrate. The p53 tumor suppressor has been dubbed the “guardian of the genome” because of its central role in the cellular response to stress. p53 functions as a transcription factor that is maintained at low levels in unstressed cells. In response to DNA damage, oncogene activation, hypoxia and oxidative damage, p53 levels and transcriptional activity are significantly enhanced, and the protein is able to initiate an anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic program that prevents the multiplication of damaged and potentially pre-cancerous cells (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6712) Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of p53 activation is not fully understood, p53 is thought to be regulated primarily by post-translational modification, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation (3Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In particular, Mdm2, a RING domain protein that is up-regulated in some tumors, is an important negative regulator of p53 function. Mdm2 binds directly to p53 and promotes its ubiquitination on six C-terminal lysines, thereby targeting it to the 26 S proteasome for degradation (4Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9391-9398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated by Chk1 and Chk2 on serine and threonine residues within the Mdm2-binding region, resulting in a disruption of the Mdm2-p53 interaction and in an increase in p53 levels (6Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W.

This mechanism accounts in part for the activation of p53 in response to DNA damage. It has recently been reported that in addition to its ubiquitin ligase activity, Mdm2 also promotes the conjugation of Nedd8 to p53 as part of its inhibitory function (9Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 83-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Nedd8 is a small ubiquitin-like protein with 53% identity to ubiquitin (10Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) that is conserved from yeast to mammals, and the function of which was first described in yeast as the ortholog Rub1 (11Liakopoulos D.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Nedd8 is linked covalently through its C-terminal carboxyl group to the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues on target proteins in a ubiquitin-like manner. Nedd8 is activated by APPBP1-Uba3, a heterodimeric E1 enzyme, and conjugated to lysine by E2 enzyme Ubc12. The best-characterized substrates of Nedd8 conjugation are proteins of the cullin family. In particular, Cullin1 (or its yeast ortholog Cdc53), a component of the Skp1·Cullin1·F-box·Roc1 (SCF) 3The abbreviations used are: SCF, Skp1·Cullin1·F-box·Roc1; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E1, activating enzyme; E2, carrier protein; E3, protein isopeptide ligase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: SCF, Skp1·Cullin1·F-box·Roc1; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E1, activating enzyme; E2, carrier protein; E3, protein isopeptide ligase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein. complex, was shown to be neddylated, and its modification was shown to be important for the ubiquitin ligase function of some SCF complexes (12Lammer D.

Roc1, the RING domain-containing subunit within the SCF complex, functions as the E3 ligase in the Cullin1 neddylation reaction (15Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

More recently, it has been reported that the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl also promotes the neddylation of its target protein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (17Oved S. Mosesson Y. Zwang Y.

Unlike ubiquitination, neddylation does not directly promote the proteasomal degradation of target proteins, and although Nedd8 contains internal lysines, it does not form polyprotein chains like ubiquitin. Several lines of evidence point to the importance of the neddylation pathway in cell cycle control and viability. A temperature-sensitive mutation in SMC1, the hamster homolog of E1 component APP-BP1, results in severe cell cycle defects at nonpermissive temperature in the ts41 cell line (18Handeli S.

We report the identification of a new Nedd8 ligase for p53, an F-box domain protein called FBXO11, and show that this protein inhibits p53 activity without affecting its stability. p53 Complex Purification—The epitope tagging strategy for the isolation of nuclear p53 protein complexes from human cells was performed essentially as described previously (20Luo J.

To obtain the FLAG-HA-p53-expressing cell line, H1299 cells were transfected with pCIN4-FLAG-HA-p53(R175H) and selected for 2 weeks on 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), until p53-expressing clones were obtained. To prevent the degradation of nuclear p53, H1299/FLAG-HA-p53(R175H) cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (50 μm, Sigma) for 6 h before harvesting. For nuclear extract preparation, cells were incubated in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and fresh protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)) for 15 min, Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem) was added to 0.2%, and the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. Pellets were vortexed for 15 min in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and fresh protease inhibitor), centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 rpm, and filtered with 0.45-μm syringe filters (Nalgene). Supernatants were diluted with buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, fresh protease inhibitor) to the 200 mm final NaCl concentration and used as nuclear extracts for M2 immunoprecipitation using α-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Binding proteins were eluted from the column with FLAG peptide (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. M2 eluates were then subjected to a second step of affinity purification on α-HA beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. p53 nuclear complexes were then eluted with HA peptide (Sigma) for 4 h at room temperature and resolved on a 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) followed by colloidal blue (Gelcode, Pierce) or silver staining. Specific bands were cut out from the gel and subjected to peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry. FBXO11 Cloning and Antibody Production—Full-length FBXO11 cDNA was amplified by PCR from Marathon-Ready HeLa cDNA (Clontech, BD Biosciences), which is tagged with an adaptor at the 5′-end and allows for the performance of 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), and cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-10 expression vector (Sigma). The expression plasmid for FBXO11(del-F-box) was produced by replacing the sequence corresponding to amino acids 152–197 with an XbaI site and cloning the fragment into p3XFLAG vector. To prepare the FBXO11 antiserum, the DNA sequence corresponding to the last 110 amino acids of FBXO11 (residues 817–927) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-2T (Promega). The GST-tagged epitope, GST-FBXO11 (817–927), was purified from Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) using GST-bind resin (Novagen) and sent to Covance for rabbit antiserum production. For antibody purification, the epitope sequence was cloned into pET14b His-tagged bacterial expression plasmid, and His-FBXO11 (817–927) was purified from Rosetta cells using nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen). The antigen was then coupled to agarose beads using AminoLink Plus Immobilization Kit (Pierce), and α-FBXO11 was affinity-purified following the manufacturer's protocol. Purification of FBXO11 Nuclear Complex—HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmid expressing FLAG-FBXO11 or FLAG-FBXO11(del-F-box) using the calcium phosphate method. Nuclear extract was prepared as described above in “p53 Complex Purification” and subjected to immunoprecipitation using M2 beads. Protein was eluted from the M2 column using FLAG peptide in BC100 buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and fresh protease inhibitor for 2 h at 4°C. A sample of the complex was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Skp1, Cullin1, and Roc1 were detected by Western blot using antibodies α-Skp1 P19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-Cullin1 AS97 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and α-Roc1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). GST-pulldown Assay—GST and GST-p53 were purified as described previously (23Li M. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Gu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50607-50611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled FBXO11 was prepared by in vitro translation using the TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 3 μg of GST protein was pre-incubated with in vitro translated FBXO11 for 1.5 h at 4 °C in BC100 buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin. GST beads were then added, and the solution was incubated for another 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and bound protein was eluted for 1 h at 4°C in BC100 buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for detection by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—HCT116 cells were lysed in BC100 buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and fresh protease inhibitor. Total protein was quantitated using protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Lysate containing 1 mg of total protein was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 1 μgof α-FBXO11, and A/G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added for overnight incubation, also at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and bound protein was eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. FBXO11 and p53 were detected by Western blot using α-FBXO11 and α-p53 DO-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Effect of FBXO11 Overexpression on p53 Stability—H1299 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes and transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 1 μg of GFP expression plasmid, 1 μg of p53 expression plasmid (pCIN4-FLAG-p53), and an increasing amount of FBXO11 expression plasmid (2, 4, 8, and 16 μg of p3XFLAG-FBXO11) as indicated. Cells were harvested after 24 h, lysed in FLAG lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 0.1% Sarkosyl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Na3VO4) containing fresh protease inhibitor and 1 mm DTT, and total protein was quantitated. FBXO11, p53, and GFP were detected by Western blot. In Vivo Ubiquitination and Neddylation Assays—The p53 lysine to arginine mutants were created using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. H1299 cells plated on 100-mm dishes were transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 8 μgof pCIN4-His-HA-Ub or pCIN4-His-HA-Nedd8, 2 μg of pCIN4-FLAG-p53, and 10 μg of p3XFLAG-FBXO11 or 2 μg of Mdm2 plasmid, as indicated. Cells were harvested after 24 h, and 10% of the cell suspension was kept for input and lysed in FLAG lysis buffer. The remaining cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer I (6 m guanidinium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm imidazole). 50 μl of nickel-agarose beads were added, and lysates were rotated for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed for 5 min at room temperature 1× in 1 ml of buffer I, 1× in 1 ml of buffer II (8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm imidazole), and 3× in 1 ml of buffer III (same composition as buffer II except pH 6.3). Bound proteins were eluted in 50 μlof2× SDS sample buffer containing 500 mm imidazole and 150 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature and resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Neddylated p53 species were detected by Western blot using p53-specific DO-1 antibody (neddylation assay) or FL-393 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, ubiquitination assay). In Vitro Neddylation Assay—His-p53 and GST-Mdm2 were purified as described previously (23Li M. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Gu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50607-50611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). SCFFBXO11 nuclear complex was purified from an H1299 stable line expressing FLAG-FBXO11 following the protocol described above in “Purification of FBXO11 Nuclear Complex.” For the in vitro p53 neddylation assay, 10 ng of His-p53 was incubated with 2 μgof Nedd8, 10 ng of E1 (APPBP1-Uba3), 200 ng of E2 (UbcH12) (all from BostonBiochem) and SCFFBXO11 complex (∼10 ng of FLAG-FBXO11) in a total reaction volume of 10 μl (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT) at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the samples were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. p53 was detected by Western blot using DO-1 antibody. Luciferase Assay—The pCIN4-FLAG-HA-p53-Nedd8 plasmid was constructed by fusing PCR-amplified and digested Nedd8 to the C terminus of p53. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (p53-/-, Mdm2-/-) double knock-out cells were transfected with 3 μg of p21-luciferase reporter plasmid, 1 μg of pRL-TK control vector, and the indicated amounts of pCIN4-FLAG-HA-p53 or pCIN4-FLAG-HA-p53-Nedd8 plasmid using the calcium phosphate method in 6-well plates. Lysis and measurements were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescence Staining—H1299 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μgof pCIN4-FLAG-HA-p53 or pCIN4-FLAG-HA-p53-Nedd8 plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were stained with α-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (21Nikolaev A.Y. Li M. Puskas N. Qin J. Gu W. Cell. 2003; 112: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). RNAi Knockdown of FBXO11—GFP (NNGCUACCUGUUCCAUGGCCA) and FBXO11 (1, NNUAGUCCAUACCAACUUCGU; 2, NNGAAUCAGGUCCUGGUGCAC; 3, NNCCGGAGACCCAGGCGAGUG) siRNA oligos were purchased from Dharmacon. U2OS and H1299 cells were plated at 80 × 103 cells per well in a 12-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected the following day using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfection was repeated after 24 h for a second round, and cells were harvested after 48 h and lysed in FLAG lysis buffer containing fresh protease inhibitor. Samples were run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and FBXO11, p53, p21, and β-actin were detected by Western blot using α-FBXO11, DO-1, C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and AC-15 (Sigma) antibodies, respectively. Purification of p53 Nuclear Complex—We used a biochemical purification strategy to identify p53-interacting factors in vivo. To this end, we generated a derivative of the p53-null human lung carcinoma H1299 cell line that stably expresses a double-tagged human p53 mutant (arginine 175 to histidine) containing N-terminal FLAG and HA epitopes (FLAG-HA-p53(R175H)) (Fig. 1A). We used transcriptionally inactive mutant p53 in the construct because wild-type p53 strongly induces apoptosis in transfected cells, making it difficult to generate a stable cell line. To isolate protein complexes containing p53, nuclear extracts from FLAG-HA-p53-expressing H1299 cells and from control cells (parental H1299) were first subjected to two rounds of immunoaffinity purification on M2-(α-FLAG) and HA-affinity columns. The eluted proteins were then fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by colloidal-blue and silver staining (Fig. 1B). As expected, we identified Mdm2, a known E3 ligase for p53, as a specific component of the complex. Identification of FBXO11 as a p53-interacting Protein—Peptide sequencing of a major band of about 120 kDa by mass spectrometry identified three peptide sequences that matched a single translation product of a cDNA clone in the GenBank™ data base (accession number NM_025133). This clone encodes a major fragment of FBXO11, a little known member of the F-box protein family (24Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 25Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (REVIEWS3002)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and homology alignment with partial cDNA sequences in the data base, we cloned the full-length cDNA for human FBXO11 (Fig. 2A, Genbank™ accession number AY827075). The N terminus of FBXO11 contains the ∼40 amino acid F-box motif common to all F-box protein family members (Fig. 2A). FBXO11 also contains a zinc finger-like domain called a UBR box at the C terminus. This domain was previously identified as the substrate-binding region of N-recognins, a family of ubiquitin ligases that recognize proteins through N-terminal signals and target them for degradation in a proteolytic pathway called the N-end rule pathway (26Tasaki T. Mulder L.C. Iwamatsu A. Lee M.J. Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. Muesing M. Kwon Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7120-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The central region of FBXO11 contains a large domain with homology to the bacterial periplasmic protein NosD, a component of the nitrous oxide reductase complex (27Zumft W.G. Viebrock-Sambale A. Braun C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Overlapping with the NosD domain are three small CASH (carbohydrate-binding proteins and sugar hydrolases) domains of unclear function (28Ciccarelli F.D. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Russell R.B. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 59-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To confirm the physical interaction between p53 and FBXO11, we first tested the binding of the two proteins in vitro in a GST-pulldown assay (Fig. 3A). 35S-Labeled in vitro translated FBXO11 bound to immobilized GST-p53 (Fig. 3A, lane 3) but not to GST alone (lane 2). We also investigated the interaction between endogenous p53 and FBXO11 protein in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3B). Total cellular extract from human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells was immunoprecipitated with α-FBXO11 or with normal rabbit IgG. As expected, Western blot analysis revealed that α-FBXO11 precipitated endogenous FBXO11 as well as endogenous p53 (Fig. 3B, lane 3), whereas the IgG control did not (lane 2). FBXO11 Is a Component of the SCF Complex—F-box family proteins are known to interact through their F-box domain with Skp1 (29Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), a linker protein that couples the F-box protein to Cullin1 and Roc1, forming a complex known as the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (30Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Several members of the F-box protein family have been shown to bind to specific substrate proteins and to recuit them to the modular SCF complex, thus promoting their ubiquitination and degradation (31Carrano A.C.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Given that FBXO11 is a member of the F-box protein family, we investigated whether it is a component of the SCF complex in vivo. We transfected HEK 293 cells with plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged FBXO11, FLAG-tagged FBXO11 lacking the F-box domain (del-F-box), or empty vector and precipitated the expressed protein with M2 (α-FLAG) antibody from nuclear extract (Fig. 2B). FLAG-FBXO11 co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Skp1, Cullin1, and Roc1 (Fig. 2B, lane 2), whereas FLAG-FBXO11(del-F-box) (lane 3) and the empty control (lane 1) did not. FBXO11 Does Not Regulate p53 Stability—Because a major function of F-box proteins involves the ubiquitination and degradation of their target proteins, we first sought to determine whether FBXO11 ubiquitinates p53 and affects its stability. We found that FBXO11 does not promote the ubiquitination of p53 in an in vivo assay (Fig. 4A). We transfected H1299 cells with p53 plasmid as well as a vector expressing His-tagged ubiquitin, alone (Fig. 4A, lane 1), with Mdm2 plasmid (lane 2), or with FBXO11 plasmid (lane 3). His-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were purified using nickel-agarose beads, and ubiquitin-modified p53 was detected by Western blot using p53-specific antibody. As expected, Mdm2 was able to promote the ubiquitination of p53 but FBXO11 was not. We also found that overexpression of FBXO11 in H1299 cells does not promote the degradation of p53 (Fig. 4B). H1299 cells were transfected with p53 alone (Fig. 4B, lane 3) and with increasing amounts of FBXO11 plasmid (lanes 4–7). The increase in FBXO11 had no effect on p53 protein levels. In addition, RNAi knockdown of FBXO11 in U2OS cells did not stabilize p53 compared with control knockdown using GFP siRNA (Fig. 7, upper panel).FIGURE 7FBXO11 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity. siRNA knockdown of FBXO11 using three different oligos (upper panel, lanes 2, 3, and 4) in U2OS results in an increase in p21 levels compared with control GFP siRNA (lane 1), whereas p53 levels are unaffected. Knockdown of FBXO11 in p53-null H1299 cells (lower panel, lanes 5 and 6) has no effect on p21 levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FBXO11 Promotes the Neddylation of p53 in Vivo and in Vitro—Roc1, the ubiquitin ligase subunit of the SCF complex, has been shown to promote the neddylation of cullins (15Kamura T.

Commun. 2003; 301: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and it has previously been suggested that p53 function is regulated by conjugation to Nedd8 (9Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 83-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to investigate whether FBXO11 can function as a Nedd8 E3 ligase for p53. FBXO11 was able to promote the neddylation of p53 in an in vivo neddylation experiment (Fig. 5A, lower panel). H1299 cells were transfected with p53 plasmid as well as a vector expressing His-tagged Nedd8, alone (Fig. 5A, lane 1) or with FBXO11 plasmid (lane 2). As for the in vivo ubiquitination assay described above, His-Nedd8-conjugated proteins were purified using nickel-agarose beads, and Nedd8-modified p53 was detected by Western blot using p53-specific antibody. His-Nedd8-conjugated p53 appears with the addition of FBXO11 plasmid (Fig. 5A, lane 2). We also used nuclear FBXO11 complex (SCFFBXO11) purified from a FLAG-FBXO11-expressing H1299 stable line in an in vitro neddylation assay (Fig. 5B). Included in the in vitro reaction are the Nedd8 E1 enzyme, a heterodimer of APP-BP1 and Uba3, the Nedd8 E2 enzyme Ubc12, purified Nedd8, His-p53, and the potential E3 ligase, SCFFBXO11. The FBXO11 complex was able to promote the neddylation of p53 under these conditions (Fig. 5B, lane 2). p53 is ubiquitinated on six C-terminal lysines, Lys-370, -372, -373, -381, -382, and -386 (4Nakamura S.

Surprisingly, their specific molecular effects are largely unknown. To characterize GC action in epidermis, we compared the transcriptional profiles of primary human keratinocytes untreated and treated with dexamethasone (DEX) for 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h using large scale microarray analyses. The majority of genes were found to be regulated only after 24 h and remained regulated throughout treatment. In addition to regulation of the expected pro-inflammatory genes, we found that GCs regulate cell fate, tissue remodeling, cell motility, differentiation, and metabolism. GCs suppress the expression of essentially all IFNγ-regulated genes, including IFNγ receptor and STAT-1, an effect that was previously unknown. GCs also block STAT-1 activation and nuclear translocation. Unexpectedly, GCs induce the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and repress pro-apoptotic ones, preventing UV-induced keratinocyte apoptosis. Consequently, treatment with GCs blocked UV-induced apoptosis of keratinocytes. GCs have profound effect on wound healing by inhibiting cell motility and the expression of the proangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor. They play an important role in tissue remodeling and scar formation by suppressing the expression of TGFβ1 and -2 and MMP1, -2, -9, and -10 and inducing TIMP-2. Finally, GCs promote terminal epidermal differentiation while simultaneously inhibiting early stage differentiation. These results provide new insights into the beneficial and adverse effects of GCs in the epidermis, defining the participating genes and mechanisms that coordinate the cellular responses important for GC-based therapies.

Because of their systemic effects on multiple targets, GCs affect many tissues differentially. They are widely used for their anti-inflammatory effects in treating asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, transplant patients, psoriasis, etc., but the mechanism of their action in skin has not been fully understood. Topical GC therapy was introduced by Sulzberger and Witten in 1952 (see Ref. 1Baumann L. Kerdel F. Freedberg I.M. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Austen F.K. Goldsmith L.A. Katz S.I. Fitzpatrick T.B. Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. 2. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1999: 2713-2717Google Scholar) and has been used since in the treatment of many dermatological diseases, including psoriasis, atopic and seborrheic dermatitis, intertrigo, and eczema. The side effects of systemic GC therapy have been identified for many tissues and organs, including skin, and may result in what was clinically described as Cushing's syndrome (2Fehm H.L. Voigt K.H. Pathobiol. Annu. 1979; 9: 225-255PubMed Google Scholar). Corticosteroids with higher potency may cause severe side effects after topical application, including irreversible striae, skin atrophy, steroid acne, and perioral and periocular dermatitis. Delayed wound healing following steroid therapy is a well known side effect (3Wicke C. Halliday B. Allen D. Roche N.S. Scheuenstuhl H. Spencer M.M. Roberts A.B. Hunt T.K. Arch.

Most of the known effects of GCs are thought to be dermal, including suppression of fibroblast proliferation, collagen turnover, and other ECM components (4Schacke H. Docke W.D. Asadullah K.

Molecular Mechanisms of Action of Steroid Hormone Receptors. Research Signpost, Kerala, India2002: 1-25Google Scholar). At the molecular level, GCs act through “pluripotent” glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) that may be active in various cellular compartments: membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus (13Lee B. Tomic-Canic M. Krstic-Demonacos M. Demonacos C. Molecular Mechanisms of Action of Steroid Hormone Receptors. Research Signpost, Kerala, India2002: 1-25Google Scholar, 14Yudt M.R. Cidlowski J.A. Mol.

In addition to operating as a transcription factor that directly binds promoter elements, GR also interacts with and affects the activity of a variety of transcription factors, thus affecting transcriptional potency of many signaling pathways, such as TNFα or epidermal growth factor (16Zhou J. Cidlowski J.A. Steroids. 2005; 70: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that GR represses the expression of epidermal keratin genes. This transcriptional regulation is mediated through a unique molecular mechanism that involves four GR monomers (17Jho S.H. Radoja N. Im M.J. Tomic-Canic M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45914-45920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Radoja N. Komine M. Jho S.H. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this conformation and DNA context, β-catenin and arginine methyltransferase (CARM-1), act as co-repressors of GR (19Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Vouthounis C. Lee B. Fallon J. Stallcup M. Merchant A. Galiano R.D. Tomic-Canic M. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We found GR inhibition to be dominant over epidermal growth factor receptor activation, leading to inhibition of keratinocyte migration and contributing to the inhibition of wound healing (20Lee B. Vouthounis C. Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Im M. Tomic-Canic M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The complex mechanism involving the transcriptional regulation of epidermal genes by GR is derived from the structure and the sequence of the response element, the conformation of the receptor and its modifications, the availability and the type of the interaction with co-regulators, and histone-modifying enzymes. To identify the tissue-specific transcriptional effects of GCs on epidermis, we utilized a large scale microarray. We found that the initial response of keratinocytes to treatment with GCs (1-4 h) involved a small number of regulated genes and focused only on three processes: transcription/signaling, cell fate, and metabolism. After the first 24 h, the response is expanded to multiple functional groups of genes, and many cellular processes are affected, including inflammation, apoptosis, cell migration, metabolism, and differentiation. Specifically, GCs inhibit keratinocyte proliferation, migration, and early stages of differentiation while inducing late differentiation. Unexpectedly, GCs seem to have an anti-apoptotic effect on keratinocytes by inducing anti-apoptotic genes and suppressing proapoptotic genes. Another surprising finding regards the potent inhibition of the IFNγ response, resulting in suppression of IFNγ expression, the IFNγ receptor, and both expression and activation of STAT-1. To the best of our knowledge, such a profound effect of GCs on the IFNγ pathway has not previously been reported in any other tissue. Taken together, these results indicate that GCs affect a wide range of processes that include not only anti-inflammatory responses but also epidermal differentiation, remodeling, metabolism and cell fate, all of which have important clinical implications in treating dermatologic disorders. Human Keratinocyte Cultures—Keratinocytes were maintained as previously published (20Lee B. Vouthounis C. Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Im M. Tomic-Canic M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), in serum-free keratinocyte medium with epidermal growth factor (Gibco), bovine pituitary extract (Gibco), and antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco) both in the presence and absence of 0.1 μm DEX (Sigma). This hormone concentration has been shown to saturate the receptor and have a potent transcriptional effect on keratinocytes (18Radoja N. Komine M. Jho S.H. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Lee B. Vouthounis C. Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Im M. Tomic-Canic M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The experiment was repeated twice using newly generated cultures. A paired set of treated and untreated cells was harvested for each time point, 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h, using 0.4% trypsin (Gibco) and stored in RNAlater (Ambion). Total RNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen). Northern blot analysis was done to assess the quality of mRNA isolated. 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed, amplified, and labeled according to the protocol (21Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Labeled cRNA was hybridized to HGU95Av2 arrays (Affymetrix), and arrays were washed and stained with anti-biotin streptavidinphycoerythin-labeled antibody using an Affymetrix fluidics station and then scanned using the Agilent GeneArray Scanner system (Hewlett-Packard). Microarray—Microarray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) was used for data extraction and for further analysis. Data mining tool 3.0 (Affymetrix) and GeneSpring™ software 5.1 (Silicon Genetics) were used for normalization, -fold change calculations, and clustering. To compare data from multiple arrays, the signal of each probe array was scaled to the same target intensity value. The microarray experiments were repeated with high reproducibility Fig. 1. -Fold changes obtained from the first and second experiments were averaged. Genes were considered regulated if expression levels differed more than 2-fold relative to untreated control at any time point. Using GeneSpring™, clustering was performed based on experiments or the expression profiles of individual genes. Functional annotation of regulated genes was performed as before (22Banno T. Adachi M. Mukkamala L. Blumenberg M. Antivir. Ther. 2003; 8: 541-554PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gazel A. Ramphal P. Rosdy M. De Wever B. Tornier C. Hosein N. Lee B. Tomic-Canic M. Blumenberg M. J. Invest.

The L2L program was used to identify the biological processes, molecular functions, and cell components of differentially expressed genes (24Newman J.C. Weiner A.M. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 81-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parameters of the program were calibrated using a set of identified NFκB-regulated genes (25Banno T. Gazel A. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18973-18980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—RNA isolation and purification was performed using Triazol (Invitrogen) extraction and subsequent Qiagen RNeasy kit column purification (Qiagen), followed by Northern blot as described (18Radoja N. Komine M. Jho S.H. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript™ first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Primer sequences were as follows: TTCTCTCCCTTCCTCTCTCC (Bak1-fw), ACTCCCTACTCCTTTTCCC (Bak1-rev), TGTCTACACTTAGCCTCTATCC (IκB-fw), ATCAGCCCCACATTCAAC (IκB-rev), TTGATAGAGTGTGGGGTGGG (TRADD-fw), ATCATTGCTTAACATTCGGGG (TRADD-rev), CCAACCTGAAAACCCACAC (BCL6-fw), ACGAAAGCATCAACACTCC (BCL6-rev), TCTCTGCCCACAGTCTTTCC (SFRP1-fw), TCACCCAATTTCACAATTCACC (SFRP1-rev), GACAGCAAAAATGACCCACC (EEF1A1-fw), ACAGCAAAGCGACCCAAAG (EEF1A1-rev), ACACCTCGTCAAACTCCTC (STAT1-rev), ACTTTCTGCTGTTACTTTCCC (STAT1-fw), GAGCAAACACATCTGACCTAC (MMP1-fw), CAAAATGAGCATCCCCTCC (MMP1-rev), CACTACTGTGCCTTTGAGTCC (MMP9-), ATCGCCAGTACTTCCCATCC (MMP9-revfw), TGCCCACAAAATCTGTTCC (MMP10-fw), and AACCTGCTTGTACCTCATTTC (MMP10-rev). Reverse transcription and amplification were carried out by incubation at 50 °C for 50 min. Initial PCR denaturation took place at 94 °C for 15 min, followed by 24-30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, initial polymerization at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final polymerization at 72 °C for 7 min. The numbers of cycles of amplification (24Newman J.C. Weiner A.M. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 81-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. Kimball J.R. Hoff M. Sun T.T. J.

Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar) were selected to detect amplified products in the exponential phase. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml of ethidium bromide (Sigma) and were visualized under UV light. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified using SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The primers used for PCR analysis were as follows: JAG1 (AATACATGTGGCCATTTCTGC, TGATTTCCTTGATCGGGTTC), TIMP1 (ACACTGTTGGCTGTGAGGAA, GTTTGCAGGGGATGGATAAA), IL-4R (GGGTCACAGTGGGAGAAGC, CAGGGCAAGAGCTTGGTAAG), LAMC2 (ACACATTAGACGGCCTCCTG, CCAGCCCCTCTTCATCTACA), FLNA (CAGTAGACTGCAGCAAAGCAG, ATGAACCCCCACCAGCAG), S100A7 (GGAGAACTTCCCCAACTTCC, ACATCGGCGAGGTAATTTGT), and EEF1A1 (CAAGCCCATGTGTGTTGAGA, CCACCGCAACTGTCTGTCT). The relative changes of gene expression were estimated and normalized to EEF1A1 by using the 2-ΔΔCT method (26Livak K. Schmittgen T. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121088) Google Scholar). Histology and Immunocytochemistry—Keratinocytes were grown on coverslips to 70% confluence. Cells were incubated for 24 h in a basal serum-free medium (custom made without hydrocortisone) and treated as follows: 0.1 μm DEX (Sigma), INF-γ 100 ng/ml (Sigma), DEX and INF-γ simulatneously for 72 h, pretreated with DEX for 24 h, and treated with INF-γ for the next 48 h or pretreated with INF-γ for 24 h and treated with DEX for 72 h. Cells were fixed in acetone-methanol (1:1) for 2 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and stained using STAT-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Human skin specimens were obtained from reduction mammoplasty following an approved protocol and treated for 24, 48, and 72 h as previously described (20Lee B. Vouthounis C. Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Im M. Tomic-Canic M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After incubation, skin biopsies were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue Tek) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Five-micrometer-thick skin sections were cut with a cryostat (Jung Frigocut 28006; Leica) and stored at -80 °C. Slides containing frozen sections were fixed in a cold acetone and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin diluted in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The following primary antibodies were as follows: monoclonal antibody against Filaggrin 1:1000 (Gift from Dr. Sun) (27Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. Kimball J.R. Hoff M. Sun T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and Involucrin 1:400 (NeoMarkers) and polyclonal antibody against STAT-1 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). These were used for overnight incubation at +4 °C. Signal was visualized using secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody 1:200 (Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted with mounting medium containing propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories). For staining with p65 antibody, 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) skin samples treated with 0.1 μm DEX or 100 ng/ml TNFα (Sigma) or pretreated with DEX for 24 h and treated with TNFα for the next 24 h were embedded in paraffin and stained following a previously published protocol (19Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Vouthounis C. Lee B. Fallon J. Stallcup M. Merchant A. Galiano R.D. Tomic-Canic M. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). All negative controls were prepared by substitution of the primary antibody with phosphate-buffered saline. Staining was analyzed using a Carl Zeiss microscope, and digital images were collected using the Adobe TWAIN_32 program. Three laboratory members blinded for the experiment performed quantification of the nuclei positive for STAT-1. The average and the S.D. values were calculated. All experiments were performed in triplicates, where 3-5 images/condition/time point were quantified. Western Blotting—Keratinocytes were incubated with or without DEX (0.1 μm) for 0, 1, 24, 48, and 72 h, and total protein extracts were obtained for each time point using a standard protocol (28Szell M. Bata-Csorgo Z. Koreck A. Pivarcsi A. Polyanka H. Szeg C. Gaal M. Dobozy A. Kemeny L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 25 μg of each protein extract was electrophoresed in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BioScience). The membrane was then incubated with Abs to STAT-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After the incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the immune complexes were visualized using Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed on x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co. Bio Max MR-Film) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proliferation Assay—Keratinocytes were seeded in 0.75-cm2 dishes at a concentration of 1100 cells/well and incubated in the keratinocyte basal media without hydorcortizone (Invitrogen) 24 h prior to treatment. Keratinocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm DEX (Sigma) for 24, 48, and 72 h and harvested by trypsinization. Growth curves were established from triplicate experiments by three laboratory members blinded to the experiment by counting cell numbers per cm2 at the each time point using a hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific). Statistical significance was determined using a standard t test. Keratinocyte Treatment and TUNEL Assay—Cells were incubated for 24 h in a basal serum-free medium (custom made without hydrocortisone) before the experiment. On the day of the experiment, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm DEX (Sigma) for 24 h (for the pretreatment condition), medium was removed from the cell cultures, and keratinocytes were irradiated with UVB irradiation (8 mJ/cm2) (Stratagene 2000 illuminator, UV Stratalinker 24000) (21Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated for 48 h in the basal keratinocyte medium and fixed for the TUNEL assay. The TUNEL assay was performed following a commercial protocol for the in situ cell death detection kit (TMR red) (Roche Applied Science). Cells were then mounted on slides using Dako flourescent mounting medium (DAKO Corp.) and examined using a microscope (Carl Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop TWAIN_32 program. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Three laboratory members blinded to the experiment counted apoptotic cells in 3-5 images/condition, and S.D. values were calculated. Global Transcriptional Changes after Glucocorticoid Treatment of Primary Human Keratinocytes—To identify the effects of GCs in epidermis, we treated primary human keratinocytes with 0.1 μm DEX for 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h, isolated and labeled mRNA, and hybridized it to Affymetrix HU95A chips. Of 12,653 total analyzed genes, 6,285 were found expressed in skin (49.7%). This is in agreement with results from other laboratories (21Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson Jr., J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). The majority of the GC-regulated genes were suppressed rather than induced. Of the 394 genes that were consistently regulated (6.3% of the total expressed in skin), 128 genes were induced, and 266 genes were suppressed. To compare experiments at different time points, cluster analysis was performed using Genespring™ 5.1, with each time point being a separate experiment. We found striking similarities among the 24, 48, and 72-h regulated genes. The most extensive regulation occurred at 24 h, where 172 genes were regulated. Most genes regulated by GCs at 24 h remained regulated until 72 h; after 48 h, only 15 of the 172 genes were not regulated, and 157 of these remained regulated even at 72 h of treatment. In addition, 125 and 74 new genes were regulated at 48 and 72 h, respectively. Very few genes were affected at 1 and 4 h. GCs affected only 23 genes at 1 h; signal transduction, cell fate, and metabolism were the predominant functional gene groups regulated. Inhibitor of κB (NFKBIA) was one of the earliest induced genes at 1 h. The same functional groups were regulated at 4 h, yet the number of regulated genes increased to a total of 64 (Table 1).TABLE 1List of genes regulated by GCs in the first 4 h of treatment Open table in a new tab To understand how GCs regulate cellular processes in keratinocytes, we summarized the microarray data in such a way that genes are clustered by their cellular functions (see below). Furthermore, we grouped several cellular functions into cellular processes, which resulted in the specific hierarchal tables summarized in Table 2. Overall, we found the genes that are involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, cornified envelope, cytoskeleton, DNA repair, ECM, interferon signaling, junctions, kinases, membrane protein, proteolysis, receptor, RNA metabolism, and secretion to be predominantly suppressed. We also found that genes involved in transcriptional regulation are among those induced by GC treatment (supplemental Tables 4-8).TABLE 2Summary list of GC-regulated genes after treatment for 24-72 h Open table in a new tab We performed real time RT-PCR to evaluate the results obtained from microarrays and found that data generated by both methods are in agreement for all of the genes tested (Fig. 2). As expected, results obtained by real time RT-PCR followed the pattern of the microarray data but were more pronounced, a predictable result, considering the more sensitive method of mRNA detection. Comparison of the lists of differentially expressed genes with their assigned ontology functions confirms the above analysis (Table 3). This is particularly apparent in the biological process category, where GCs induced the regulators of transcription, whereas they suppressed immune response and related processes. Similarly, the molecular functions overrepresented in the induced genes contain transcription factors and signaling proteins, whereas among suppressed genes the proteolysis inhibitors are significantly overrepresented. Correspondingly, the nuclear components are predominant in the induced set, whereas the extracellular matrix genes are suppressed by GCs.TABLE 3Ontological categories of GC-regulated genes Open table in a new tab We have described here the expression changes that glucocorticoid treatment exerts on the principal cellular components of epidermal tissue, primary human keratinocytes, thus providing a comprehensive view of the set of genes and cellular processes that are affected by GC treatment. Furthermore, we have described novel actions of GCs in epidermal keratinocytes, since we discovered a wide spectrum of genes affecting additional cellular processes that have not been associated previously with GCs. Specifically, we found that GCs inhibit apoptosis and block antigen presentation, tissue repair and remodeling, metabolism, keratinocyte migration and proliferation, differentiation, and cell fate control. Below, we focused on the analyses of specific gene groups and cellular processes regulated by GC treatment. Inflammation and Innate Immunity—GCs are known as major anti-inflammatory agents, and this served as a control for our experiments. A summary of microarray results is presented in supplemental Table 4. We found that within the first1hof treatment and throughout all time points, GCs induce the expression of IkB, suggesting early effects on NFκB inhibition (30Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). We did not find either NFκB components (such as p65 or p50) or TNFα ligand and receptor to be regulated. The inhibitory effects of GCs on pro-inflammatory processes include repression of interleukin signaling, specifically the expression of IL-1β, IL-4 receptor, and IL-11 genes after 24 h. It was surprising that other than inducing IκB, GCs did not regulate transcription of other TNFα signaling molecules. There are several molecular mechanisms through which GR-mediated inhibition of NFκB may be accomplished, reflecting tissue-specific effects (31De Bosscher K. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. J.

https://openalex.org/W2070102051,"Sea urchins are major components of marine communities. Their grazing limits algal biomass, and they are preyed upon by many predators. Purple sea urchins ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ) are among the best studied species. They live in environments that alternate between two stable states: luxuriant, species-rich kelp forests and sea urchin–dominated “barrens.” The transition from one state to the other can be initiated by several factors, including the abundance of algal food, predators, storm intensities, and incidence of disease. Purple sea urchins compete with other grazers, some of which are important fishery resources (such as abalones and red sea urchins), and they are harvested for scientific research. Revelations from their genome will lead to a better understanding of how they maintain their ecological importance, and may in turn enhance their economic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2022120527,"Potassium channels are K + -selective protein pores in cell membrane. The selectivity filter is the functional unit that allows K + channels to distinguish potassium (K + ) and sodium (Na + ) ions. The filter's structure depends on whether K + or Na + ions are bound inside it. We synthesized a K + channel containing the d -enantiomer of alanine in place of a conserved glycine and found by x-ray crystallography that its filter maintains the K + (conductive) structure in the presence of Na + and very low concentrations of K + . This channel conducts Na + in the absence of K + but not in the presence of K + . These findings demonstrate that the ability of the channel to adapt its structure differently to K + and Na + is a fundamental aspect of ion selectivity, as is the ability of multiple K + ions to compete effectively with Na + for the conductive filter."
https://openalex.org/W2116515774,"The critical role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression levels in developmental angiogenesis is well established. Nonetheless, the effects of different local (microenvironmental) VEGF concentrations in ischemia have not been studied in the adult organism, and VEGF delivery to patients has been disappointing. Here, we demonstrate the existence of both lower and upper threshold levels of microenvironmental VEGF concentrations for the induction of therapeutic vessel growth in ischemia. In the ischemic hind limb, implantation of myoblasts transduced to express VEGF164 at different levels per cell increased blood flow only moderately, and vascular leakage and aberrant preangiomatous vessels were always induced. When the same total dose was uniformly distributed by implanting a monoclonal population derived from a single VEGF-expressing myoblast, blood flow was fully restored to nonischemic levels, collateral growth was induced, and ischemic damage was prevented. Hemangiomas were avoided and only normal, pericyte-covered vessels were induced persisting over 15 mo. Surprisingly, clones uniformly expressing either lower or higher VEGF levels failed to provide any functional benefit. A biphasic effect of VEGF dose on vessel number and diameter was found. Blood flow was only improved if vessels were increased both in size and in number. Microenvironmental VEGF concentrations determine efficacy and safety in a therapeutic setting."
https://openalex.org/W2151746205,"Conventional ecological theory predicts that predators affect nutrient cycling by decreasing the abundance or activity of prey. By using a predator-detritivore-detritus food chain in bromeliads, we show that predators can increase nutrient cycling by a previously undescribed, but broadly applicable, mechanism: reducing nutrient export by prey emigration. Contrary to expectations, predation on detritivores increases detrital nitrogen uptake by bromeliads. Predation reduces detritivore emergence and hence export of nitrogen from the system. Detritivores therefore benefit their host plant, but only when predators are present. More generally, our results show that predator loss or extinction can dramatically and unexpectedly affect ecosystem functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2137944162,"A long-debated issue concerning the nucleosynthesis of neutron-rich elements in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is the identification of the neutron source. We report intermediate-mass (4 to 8 solar masses) AGB stars in our Galaxy that are rubidium-rich as a result of overproduction of the long-lived radioactive isotope 87 Rb, as predicted theoretically 40 years ago. This finding represents direct observational evidence that the 22 Ne(α,n) 25 Mg reaction must be the dominant neutron source in these stars. These stars challenge our understanding of the late stages of the evolution of intermediate-mass stars and would have promoted a highly variable Rb/Sr environment in the early solar nebula."
https://openalex.org/W2052273234,"Survivin appears to function as an apoptosis inhibitor and a regulator of cell division during development and tumorigenesis. Here we report the molecular characterization of the nucleocytoplasmic transport of survivin and its potential implications for tumorigenesis. We identified an evolutionary conserved Crm1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES) in survivin. In dividing cells, the NES is essential for tethering survivin and the survivin/Aurora-B kinase complex to the mitotic machinery, which in turn appears to be essential for proper cell division. In addition, export seems to be required for the cytoprotective activity of survivin, as export-deficient survivin fails to protect tumor cells against chemo- and radiotherapy-induced apoptosis. These findings appear to be clinically relevant since preferential nuclear localization of survivin correlated with enhanced survival in colorectal cancer patients. Targeting survivin's nuclear export by the application of NES-specific antibodies promoted its nuclear accumulation and inhibited its cytoprotective function. We demonstrate that nuclear export is essential for the biological activity of survivin and promote the identification of molecular decoys to specifically interfere with survivin's nuclear export as potential anticancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2072799789,"TRPM7 is a ubiquitously expressed nonspecific cation channel that has been implicated in cellular Mg2+ homeostasis. We have recently shown that moderate overexpression of TRPM7 in neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells elevates cytosolic Ca2+ levels and enhances cell-matrix adhesion. Furthermore, activation of TRPM7 by phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptor agonists caused a further increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and augmented cell adhesion and spreading in a Ca2+-dependent manner (1Clark K.

Regulation of the TRPM7 channel is not well understood, although it has been reported that PIP2 hydrolysis closes the channel. Here we have examined the regulation of TRPM7 by PLC-coupled receptor agonists such as bradykinin, lysophosphatidic acid, and thrombin. Using FRET assays for second messengers, we have shown that the TRPM7-dependent Ca2+ increase closely correlates with activation of PLC. Under non-invasive “perforated patch clamp” conditions, we have found similar activation of TRPM7 by PLC-coupled receptor agonists. Although we could confirm that, under whole-cell conditions, the TRPM7 currents were significantly inhibited following PLC activation, this PLC-dependent inhibition was only observed when [Mg2+]i was reduced below physiological levels.

A characteristic feature is the inhibition of TRPM7 currents by physiological (1–2 mm) intracellular Mg2+ levels; in whole-cell patch clamp experiments, large outwardly rectifying TRPM7 currents (3Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 7Runnels L.W.

Furthermore, MgATP and MgGTP also inhibit the channels (3Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A.

Physiol. 2002; 120: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). TRPM7 currents have been termed MagNuM (for Mg2+ nucleotide-regulated metal ion (3Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A.

Physiol. 2002; 120: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar)) currents. These terms will here be used interchangeably to reflect whole-cell currents evoked by internal Mg2+ depletion. MIC/MagNuM currents revert at about 0 mV and lack voltage- and time-dependent activation (3Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 7Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Inward currents are predominantly carried by divalent cations, whereas outward currents consist mainly of monovalent cations (at low [Mg2+]i). Outward rectification is most likely due to divalent permeation block of inward currents at negative potentials (3Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), because perfusion with divalent-free extracellular solutions augments inward currents and linearizes the I/V relationship. The activation of TRPM7 by internal perfusion with Mg2+-free solutions does not reflect the release of the permeation block, but the precise mechanism has not yet been solved (10Kozak J.A. Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Several reports document that the set point for [Mg2+]i sensitivity is governed by the kinase domain; however, TRPM7 channels lacking the kinase domain can still be activated by internal Mg2+ depletion (4Schmitz C.

Thus, the interactions of TRPM7 with Mg2+ are complex; Mg2+ is conducted through the channel pore, causes voltage-dependent permeation block, and influences gating at the cytosolic surface. The exact mechanisms by which receptor agonists regulate TRPM7 are less well characterized, and the published data are, at least partly, conflicting. An initially claimed indispensable role for the kinase domain (7Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) was challenged in subsequent studies (4Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) that the TRPM7 α-kinase specifically phosphorylates the heavy chain of myosin-II, thereby strongly influencing cell adhesion. Importantly, association with and subsequent phosphorylation of myosin-II depend on prior activation of the channel by phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptors, and influx of extracellular Ca2+ constitutes an essential step in this process (1Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G. Figdor C.G. Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. van Leeuwen F.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, TRPM7 binds directly to several PLC isoforms, including PLCγ and PLCβ (14Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of PLC on TRPM7 observed in intact cells by biochemical, cell-biological, and live cell-imaging studies contrasts with a report that, in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, whole-cell TRPM7 currents are inhibited by PIP2 hydrolysis (14Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). PIP2-dependent gating also occurs in other TRP family members, including TRPV1 (15Prescott E.D. Julius D. Science. 2003; 300: 1284-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), TRPM4 (16Zhang Z. Okawa H. Wang Y. Liman E.R. J. Biol.

Penner R. Fleig A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given the discrepancies between the documented whole-cell patch clamp results and our cell biological observations, we re-examined how PLC-activating receptor agonists affect TRPM7 currents using non-invasive techniques in cells that moderately overexpress TRPM7. To this end, we combined fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays for second messengers with perforated patch experiments and Ca2+ fluorometry to show that opening of TRPM7 channels closely correlates with PLC activation but not with cAMP/cGMP signaling. We also showed that, in perforated patches, TRPM7 currents are evoked by treatment of intact cells with a membrane-permeable Mg2+ chelator (EDTA-AM) and that these currents are inhibited rather than augmented by PLC-activating receptor agonists. We conclude that PLC-coupled agonists activate rather than inhibit TRPM7 in intact cells.

Preimmune serum was used as a control in all experiments. For immunolabeling, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with rabbit anti-TRPM7 sera (1:200) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (1:1000). Amplification was by tyramide-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the in vitro kinase assay, TRPM7 was precipitated from lysed cells with anti-TRPM7 antibodies and assayed for kinase activity as published recently (1Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L.

Excitation was at 425 nm using an ND3 filter, and cyan and yellow fluorescent protein emissions were collected simultaneously at 470 ± 20 and 530 ± 25 nm, respectively. Data were acquired at 4 Hz, and FRET was expressed as the ratio of cyan to yellow fluorescent protein signals. This ratio was set to 1.0 at the onset of the experiments, and changes are expressed as the percent of deviation from this initial value. Patch Clamp Experiments—Electrophysiological recordings were collected using the HEKA EPC9 system. Current recordings were digitized at 100 kHz (ramp and block pulse protocols) or 10 Hz (steady-state whole-cell currents). Borosilicate glass pipettes were fire-polished to 2–4 MΩ. After establishment of the GΩ seal, the patched membrane was ruptured by gentle suction to obtain whole-cell configuration, or amphotericin B (240 μg/ml) was used to obtain the perforated patch configuration with the typical access resistance of 3–10 MΩ. Solutions were (in mm) 120 whole-cell pipette potassium-glutamate, 30 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.2 CaCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, and 1 MgATP; 140 external solution NaCl, 5 KCl, 0–1 MgCl2, 0–10 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH; for perforated patch recordings, the pipette solution was complemented with 240 μg/ml amphotericin B, and MgATP was omitted. TRPM7 Expression Raises Basal and Agonist-induced Cytosolic Ca2+ Levels—Consistent with previous observations (3Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), we found that transient overexpression of TRPM7 channels was lethal to N1E-115 cells and several other cell lines tested within a few days (data not shown). Furthermore, at early time points after transfection, much of the TRPM7 protein was found localized to biosynthetic compartments. To circumvent these problems, we expressed TRPM7 in N1E-115 cells at low levels by retroviral transduction (1Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G. Figdor C.G. Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. van Leeuwen F.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These cells, termed N1E-115/TRPM7 cells, were viable, divided normally, and could be routinely kept in culture for several months (1Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G. Figdor C.G. Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. van Leeuwen F.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Using a TRPM7-specific antibody (1Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G. Figdor C.G. Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. van Leeuwen F.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the expression level in N1E-115/TRPM7 cells was found to be 2–3 times higher than that in the parental cells (Fig. 1a). Under these conditions, the TRPM7 mainly localized to the plasma membrane, as shown in Fig. 1b. Moreover, depletion of intracellular Mg2+ in whole-cell patch clamp recordings showed that N1E-115/TRPM7 has ∼2.5 times higher current density of MIC/MagNuM currents than wild type (wt) cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Ratiometric analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed that intracellular Ca2+ was elevated significantly in N1E-115/TRPM7 cells (108.9 ± 6.0 nm, n = 50) as compared with parental cells (85.3 ± 2.5 nm, n = 50; p < 0.05) (Fig. 1c). Thus, TRPM7 channel expression contributes to basal Ca2+ homeostasis, in agreement with reports that the channels are partly preactivated (1Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G.

Jalink K. van Leeuwen F.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) indicate that TRPM7 channels are activated by bradykinin (BK), we monitored the effect of the addition of BK on TRPM7-mediated Ca2+ influx by comparing N1E-115/TRPM7 to parental cells. In parental cells, 1 μm BK induced a cytosolic Ca2+ increase (765.9 ± 9.7 nm, n = 80) that peaked within seconds and subsequently returned to values close to resting levels (92.9 ± 2.9 nm) within 60 s (Fig. 1d, left panel). This corresponds to a mean increase of 7.6 nm from basal levels, which was not statistically significant. In contrast, in N1E-115/TRPM7 cells, the BK-induced transient Ca2+ increase (peak 843.3 ± 12.7 nm) was followed by a prominent sustained Ca2+ elevation (141.0 ± 7.0 nm, n = 120) that lasted for several minutes before returning to resting levels rather abruptly (Fig. 1d, right panel; quantification in Fig. 1c). This corresponds to a mean increase in sustained Ca2+ levels of 32.1 nm (p < 0.001, paired t test) in accordance with the higher TRPM7 expression levels in these cells. Thus, in N1E-115/TRPM7 cells, the addition of BK elicits a sustained phase in the Ca2+ response, in good agreement with our cell biological data (1Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G. Figdor C.G. Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. van Leeuwen F.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In summary, the observed increase in Ca2+ influx is mediated by TRPM7 channels and is not due to the retroviral transduction procedure (supplemental Fig. S2). TRPM7 Activation Is Downstream of PLC in Intact N1E-115 Cells—Endogenous B2 bradykinin receptors in N1E-115 cells signal predominantly via the Gq-linked PLC pathway (27Coggan J.S. Thompson S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C841-C848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but some reports suggest that, depending on the cell type, the B2 receptors may occasionally either inhibit (28Hanke S. Nurnberg B. Groll D.H. Liebmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8452-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or stimulate (29Albert O. Ancellin N. Preisser L. Morel A. Corman B. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) the production of cAMP. We set out to identify the signaling events responsible for BK-induced activation of TRPM7 in N1E-115/TRPM7 cells by correlating Ca2+ fluorometry with the activation of intracellular signaling pathways, as detected by various FRET assays. BK caused rapid breakdown of a significant fraction (60–80%) of the plasma membrane PIP2 pool, as detected by a FRET assay (21van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) that reports membrane PIP2 content (Fig. 2a, upper panel, first trace). The Gq/PLC-coupled receptor agonist lysophosphatidic acid and thrombin receptor-activating peptide also activate PLC, although to a lesser extent (∼20–30% of BK values; n > 200) (Fig. 2a, upper panel, second and third trace (21van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)). Similar to BK, the initial Ca2+ peak induced by these agonists was followed by sustained Ca2+ influx in N1E-115/TRPM7 cells (Fig. 2a, lower panel). In contrast, sustained Ca2+ influx was not seen when cells were stimulated with agonists of receptors that do not couple to PLC, such as prostaglandin E1 (Fig. 2a, 4th trace, and data not shown). Thus, TRPM7 activation correlates well with PLC activation/Ca2+ signaling. To address the possible involvement of cAMP in the BK-induced opening of TRPM7, we monitored cAMP levels in intact N1E-115/TRPM7 cells using a genetically encoded cAMP sensor (30Zaccolo M. De Giorgi F. Cho C.Y. Feng L. Knapp T. Negulescu P.A. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 31Bacskai B.J. Hochner B. Mahaut-Smith M. Adams S.R. Kaang B.K. Kandel E.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1993; 260: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The addition of BK to N1E-115/TRPM7 cells had no effect on cAMP levels (n = 8), whereas forskolin (25 μm) readily raised cAMP levels (Fig. 2b, left panel). Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin to specifically inhibit Gi and thereby block receptor-induced decreases in cAMP levels did not affect the BK-induced Ca2+ influx (data not shown). Therefore, in N1E-115/TRPM7 cells, changes in cAMP levels do not mediate the BK-induced opening of TRPM7. In addition, neither prostaglandin E1, which activates Gs to cause a rapid and sustained increase in [cAMP]i (Fig. 2b, middle panel), nor sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P, data not shown), which couples to Gi and G13 but not to PLC in N1E-115 cells (32Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Offermanns S. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), had any effect on Ca2+ levels. We conclude that there is no evidence for a role of cAMP in BK-mediated Ca2+ influx in N1E-115/TRPM7 cells. We also investigated the effects of the nitric oxide donor nitroprusside, because nitric oxide was reported to activate TRPM7-mediated Ca2+ influx in cultured cortical neurons (33Aarts M. Iihara K.

In intact parental and N1E-115/TRPM7 cells, nitroprusside triggered the production of cGMP (Fig. 2c, left panel (24Ponsioen B. Zhao J. Riedl J. Zwartkruis F. van der Krogt G. Zaccolo M.

In conclusion, TRPM7 opening closely correlates with PLC activation but not with other G protein-linked signals. Activation of PLC Inhibits Whole-cell TRPM7 Currents in N1E-115/TRPM7 Cells—In whole-cell patch clamp experiments using HEK-293 cells overexpressing M1 muscarinic receptors, TRPM7 channels were shown to be inhibited by carbachol-induced PIP2 breakdown (14Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). This inhibition was reverted to by intracellular perfusion with a water-soluble PIP2 analogue. However, our cell biological observations (1Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G. Figdor C.G. Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. van Leeuwen F.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and Ca2+ data (see above) show that PLC activation causes opening rather than closure of TRPM7 channels. We therefore tested whether voltage ramp-induced TRPM7 currents, recorded in whole cells with Mg2+-free pipet"

Stomatal closure in response to the drought stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), results from anion and K+ release from guard cells. Previous studies have shown that cytosolic Ca2+ elevation and ABA activate S-type anion channels in the plasma membrane of guard cells, leading to stomatal closure. However, membrane-bound regulators of abscisic acid signaling and guard cell anion channels remain unknown. Here we show that the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein AtMRP5 is localized to the plasma membrane. Mutation in the AtMRP5 ABC protein impairs abscisic acid and cytosolic Ca2+ activation of slow (S-type) anion channels in the plasma membrane of guard cells. Interestingly, atmrp5 insertion mutant guard cells also show impairment in abscisic acid activation of Ca2+-permeable channel currents in the plasma membrane of guard cells. These data provide evidence that the AtMRP5 ABC transporter is a central regulator of guard cell ion channel during abscisic acid and Ca2+ signal transduction in guard cells.

Guard cells are highly specialized epidermal cells that in pairs form stomatal pores in aerial organs of plants. Each pair of guard cells forms a pore through which water and CO2 exchange occurs. Guard cells modulate stomatal pore size by coordinating responses to environmental and physiological factors, including light, temperature, Ca2+, and the plant hormone abscisic acid. These factors induce dynamic changes in the intracellular concentrations of inorganic and organic ions. Stomatal opening occurs by osmotic swelling of guard cells, caused by K+ uptake through inward K+ channels, Cl- uptake, and production of organic solutes (1MacRobbie E.A.C. Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.

Anion efflux, Ca2+ influx, and H+-ATPase inhibition depolarize the membrane potential of guard cells, thus providing the driving force for K+ efflux through outward K+ channels (10Schroeder J.I. J.

The present understanding of the guard cell signal transduction network and of the functions of individual genes in these processes has benefited from the analyses of mutants affected in stomatal physiology. First mutants that impair Ca2+-activation of anion channels have been recently identified, demonstrating that Ca2+-dependent protein kinases function in this response (9Mori I.C. Murata Y. Yang Y. Munemasa S. Wang Y.-F. Andreoli S. Tiriac H. Alonso J.M. Harper J.F. Ecker J.R. Kwak J.M. Schroeder J.I. PloS Biol. 2006; 4: 1749-1762Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, the membrane proteins that function in channel regulation remain unknown. The ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is a large, ubiquitous, and diverse group of proteins, most of which mediate substrate transport across biological membranes (13Sanchez-Fernandez R.

Forestier C. Kolukisaoglu H.U. Mueller-Roeber B. Schulz B. Planta. 2002; 214: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). ABC transporters have been shown to function not only as ATP-dependent pumps but also as ion channels and ion channel regulators. In animals, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exhibits ion channel activity and CFTR and sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) also modulate the activity of associated ion channels. In addition, both of these membrane proteins are receptors for sulfonylureas (15Schmid-Antomarchi H. de Weille J. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Schultz B.D. DeRoos A.D.G. Venglarik C.J. Singh A.K. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J.

Leonhardt et al. (6Leonhardt N. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1141-1151PubMed Google Scholar, 19Leonhardt N. Marin E. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subsequently, it was shown that glibenclamide-induced stomatal opening is impaired in Arabidopsis plants carrying a T-DNA insertion in the AtMRP5 gene, which encodes a multidrug resistance-associated protein. Homozygous atmrp5-1 T-DNA insertion lines do not open their stomatal pores in response to glibenclamide (20Gaedeke N. Klein M. Kolukisaoglu H.U. Forestier C. Muller A. Ansorge M. Becker D. Mamnun Y. Kuchler K. Schulz B. Mueller-Roeber B. Martinoia E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and AtMRP5 expressed in mammalian HEK293 cells is able to bind glibenclamide (21Lee E.K. Kwon M. Ko J.H. Yi H. Hwang M.G. Chang S. Cho M.H. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results suggest that AtMRP5 is responsible for glibenclamide-induced stomatal opening. In addition, detailed physiological analysis revealed that the stomata of atmrp5-1 mutant plants opened slightly less in the light and exhibited a reduced sensitivity to ABA and external calcium (22Klein M. Perfus-Barbeoch L. Frelet A. Gaedeke N. Reinhardt D. Mueller-Roeber B. Martinoia E. Forestier C. Plant J. 2003; 33: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Overall, atmrp5-1 mutant plants were less susceptible to drought stress. Different roles of AtMRP5 in guard cell regulation can be hypothesized: (i) AtMRP5 encodes a guard cell anion channel; (ii) AtMRP5 directly modulates a guard cell ion channel; and (iii) AtMRP5 does not modulate ion channels but affects regulation of stomatal movements via other structural or metabolic mechanisms. To analyze the functions of AtMRP5 in signal transduction during regulation of stomatal movements and to distinguish among these hypotheses, we localized AtMRP5 and performed patch clamp analyses of guard cell anion and Ca2+-permeable channels in atmrp5 mutant and wild-type guard cells, which reveal an interesting dual regulation of both ion channel types. Plant Growth—Arabidopsis thaliana plants, ecotype WS (Wassilewskija), were grown for 3–4 weeks in pots in standard soil (ED 73 + Bims, Einheitserde, Germany) in a plant growth chamber with an 8-h light period (100 μmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic active radiation) at 22 °C and a 16-h dark period at 21 °C and relative humidity of 70%, or as described previously (23Allen G.J. Murata Y. Chu S.P. Nafisi M. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1649-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Plants were watered daily. Molecular Cloning of AtMRP5-GFP and Generation of Transgenic Plants—The AtMRP5 cDNA was cloned via NotI-NotI digestion from pN-AtMRP5 (20Gaedeke N. Klein M. Kolukisaoglu H.U. Forestier C. Muller A. Ansorge M. Becker D. Mamnun Y. Kuchler K. Schulz B. Mueller-Roeber B. Martinoia E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) into pRTΩ-Not (24Uberlacker B. Werr W. Mol. Breeding. 1996; 2: 293-295Crossref Google Scholar) resulting in pRTΩ-MRP5. In this vector, AtMRP5 was placed under the control of CaMV (cauliflower mosaic virus) 35S promoter and the Cabb B-D polyadenylation signal. To construct a C-terminal in-frame fusion between AtMRP5 and GFP6, the terminal 1215 bases of AtMRP5 were amplified using primers 5Z-s (5′-ctt caa gag aat tgg) and 5Y-as (5′-cg tctaga gcggccgc cccggg taa ttc agg gat tcc) where XbaI, NotI, and SmaI sites in 5Y-as are underlined. In 5Y-as, the stop codon of AtMRP5 was omitted. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega, Madison, WI) resulting in pG-5Y. AtMRP5 contains a unique XbaI site at position +3465 of the coding sequence. The entire gene of an enhanced GFP version (GFP6) (25Humair D. Hernandez Felipe D. Neuhaus J.M. Paris N. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using primers GFP5SmaI-s (5′-cgg cccggg ggt ggc gga ggg atg agt aaa gga gaa gaa ctt ttc ac) and GFP6SmaI-as (5′-cgg cccggg gagctc tta ttt gta tag ttc atc cat gcc atg tg). In GFP5SmaI-s, a SmaI restriction site (underlined) and four glycine codons (bold) were introduced upstream of the EGFP coding sequence. In GFP6SmaI-as, SacI and SmaI sites (underlined) were introduced downstream of the stop codon of GFP6. The amplified GFP6 fragment was introduced into pG-6Y via SmaI. The resulting fragment fused to GFP6 was released by XbaI and cloned into XbaI-cut pRTΩ-MRP5 resulting in pRTΩ-MRP5GFP. Because pRTΩ-MRP5 contains an additional XbaI site in the cassette cloning site 3′ of AtMRP5, XbaI restriction allowed replacement of the native AtMRP5 3′ end with the fragment carrying the GFP6 fusion. All PCR fragments and plasmids were verified by sequencing. The cassette containing AtMRP5-GFP was excised using AscI and inserted into either pCambia1302 (www.cambia.org) or pGreen0179. Both vectors were modified to contain a unique AscI site in the multicloning site by insertion of a linker. 7M. Klein, unpublished. The resulting constructs pC1302-AtMRP5-GFP and pG0179-AtMRP5-GFP were used to transform either Arabidopsis wild-type plants or mutant atmrp5-1 plants by floral dipping using Agrobacterium strain GV3101 (26Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More than 25 T1 transformants for each construct were selected on half-strength MS (Murashigo and Skoog, Duchefa) medium agar plates containing hygromycin (Duchefa) for 7 days and were subsequently transferred on fresh sterile agar plates without antibiotic before transfer to soil pots. Root Length of Complemented Lines—Homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing AtMRP5-GFP, wild-type (Ws-2), and atmrp5-1 mutants were grown on half-strength MS (Sigma) medium in a vertical position for 9 days in continuous light. These plates were scanned using EPSON Perfection 2450 PHOTO, and the roots were measured using the measuring tool integrated in the Leica IM1000 software (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). Analysis of Stomatal Apertures—For experiments at the University of Zurich stomatal apertures of rosette leaves of 7- to 8-week-old plants were measured according to the method of Lascève et al. (27Lascève G. Leymarie J. Vavasseur A. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 350-358Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Measurements were started in the morning after 15–16 h of darkness. Leaves were detached and floated on a solution containing 10 mm KCl, 30 mm KOH, 10 mm MES-iminodiacetic acid, pH 6.0, in Petri dishes containing glibenclamide at the indicated concentrations. Glibenclamide-dependent stomatal apertures were analyzed after 2 h in the dark at 20 °C. Parts of abaxial epidermis were peeled off with sharp forceps, transferred into a drop of floating solution on a glass slide, and immediately processed for microscopic analysis of stomatal apertures. For experiments at UCSD, leaves of 4- to 5-week-old wild-type and atmrp5-1 plants were incubated in white light with a fluency rate of 125 μmol m-2 s-1 for 2.5 h in stomatal opening solution containing 5 mm KCl, 50 μm CaCl2, and 10 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.15. Stomatal apertures were measured 2.5 h after glibenclamide or ABA were added. Plants were grown in growth chambers with a period of 16-h light with 8-h darkness. Standard errors were calculated relative to the number of epidermal peel experiments. Bright-field pictures of stomata were taken with a Leica DMR microscope equipped by a Leica DC300F charged coupled device camera and controlled by software (Leica) or with an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope and a charged coupled device camera as previously described (23Allen G.J. Murata Y. Chu S.P. Nafisi M. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1649-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The width of the stomatal pores was determined using the measuring tool integrated in imaging software. Protoplast Isolation—For the analysis of AtMRP5-GFP, homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis plants were grown for 7 days on half-strength MS medium under continuous light. Protoplasts were prepared following the procedure described in Song et al. (28Song W.Y. Sohn E.J. Martinoia E. Lee Y.J. Yang Y.Y. Jasinski M. Forestier C. Hwang I. Lee Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (see supplemental “Materials and Methods”). Seedlings were incubated in medium A (0.5 m Sorbitol, 20 mm MES/KOH, pH 5.6, 1 mm CaCl2) containing 0.03% (w/v) pectolyase Y-23 and 0.75% (w/v) cellulase Y-C for 2 h at 30 °C. The protoplasts were collected by centrifugation (250 × g, 5 min) on a cushion of osmotically stabilized Percoll (Amersham Biosciences, 500 mm sorbitol, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0). They were washed in medium B (500 mm betaine, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MES/KOH, pH 5.6) three times with a centrifugation at 180 × g, 5 min to recover them at the bottom of the tube and to remove Percoll in the medium. For patch clamp analyses at the University of Zurich, guard cell protoplasts were isolated by a two-step enzyme digestion as described by Wang et al. (29Wang X.-Q. Ullah H. Jones A.M. Assmann S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 2070-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), except that protoplasts were resuspended in a 500 mm mannitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2 in the final step. For analysis of ABA regulation of ICa channel currents and S-type anion currents at UCSD, wild-type Ws-2 and mutant plants were grown in soil in a plant growth chamber with a 16-h light (75 μmol s-1 m-2 light fluence rate) and 8-h dark regime at 20 °C and watered every 2 days. Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts were isolated enzymatically from leaf epidermal strips of 4- to 6-week-old plants as described previously (30Murata Y. Pei Z.-M. Mori I.C. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophysiological Measurements—Whole cell patch clamping was performed on guard cell protoplasts. S-type anion channel activity was measured in the absence or the presence of ABA and under high and low calcium concentrations. For experiments performed at the University of Zurich, the bath contained 40 mm CaCl2 (23Allen G.J. Murata Y. Chu S.P. Nafisi M. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1649-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MES-Tris (pH 5.5); the pipette contained 150 mm tetraethyl-ammonium-Cl, 2 mm MgCl2, 6.7 mm EGTA, 3.35 mm CaCl2, 5 mm ATP (4 mm ATP and 1 mm GTP in ABA experiments), and 10 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.2), which results in a free intracellular calcium concentration of 0.26 μm. For high cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) experiments, CaCl2 was increased to 5.864 mm, which results in 2 μm free calcium. Free calcium concentration was calculated using “CALCIUM” software. Osmolality was adjusted to 500 mos·mol·kg-1 with sorbitol. For ABA experiments, cells were preincubated with 50 μm ABA (50 mm stock solution in ethanol, and final ethanol concentration of 0.1%) for 90 min on ice, and ABA was included in the pipette and bath during the recording. After establishing the whole cell configuration, the membrane potential was held at 30 mV for 10 min, and subsequently the channel activity was measured by applying a voltage protocol consisting of seven pulses starting at -145 mV. The duration of each pulse was 40 s, and the increase in voltage was +30 mV (31Schroeder J.I. Keller B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5025-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Current amplitudes were measured at the end of voltage pulses. At the University of Zurich electrophysiological measurements were performed with an EPC10 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Data acquisition and analysis were made using PULSE (HEKA). Patch pipettes were prepared from N-51A capillaries (Garner glass, Claremont, CA) by a DMZ-Universal puller (Zeitz Instruments GmbH, München, Germany). Currents were low pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 1 kHz. For experiments performed at UCSD, the pipette solution contained 5 mm ATP-Tris, 150 mm CsCl, 6.7 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.1 with Tris. The CaCl2 concentration was calculated to obtain a concentration of free [Ca2+]cyt equal to 2 μm as described previously (7Allen G.J. Kuchitsu K. Chu S.P. Murata Y. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1785-1798PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the bath contained 30 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm MES adjusted to pH 5.6 with Tris. The osmolalities of pipette and bath solutions were adjusted using an osmometer (Model 5500, Wescor, Inc., Logan, UT) to 500 mmol/kg and 485 mmol/kg with d-sorbitol, respectively. The bath solution for guard cell protoplast preincubation was supplemented with 40 mm CaCl2 (23Allen G.J. Murata Y. Chu S.P. Nafisi M. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1649-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 12–15 min after establishment of the whole cell configurations, the bath solution containing 1 mm CaCl2 was perfused, and voltage pulses were applied. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of ICa currents and S-type anion currents at UCSD in Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts were performed using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), which was connected to a microcomputer via an interface as described previously (5Pei Z.-M. Kuchitsu K. Ward J.M. Schwarz M. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Seal resistances were >10 GΩ. The liquid junction potential was measured for ICa analyses and corrected as described previously (33Bolte S. Brown S. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). pClamp software (version 8.0, Axon Instruments) was used to acquire and analyze whole cell currents. Voltage ramps were applied each minute with a ramp speed of -210 mV s-1. For ICa current analyses, the bath solution contained 100 mm BaCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MES adjusted to pH 5.6 with Tris, and the pipette solution contained 10 mm BaCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes adjusted to pH 7.1 with Tris. The osmolalities of bath and pipette solutions were adjusted to 485 and 500 mmol/kg with d-sorbitol, respectively. 1 mm NADPH was freshly added to the pipette solution before experiments each day. Approximately 20 min after establishment of the whole cell configuration, 50 μm ABA was added extracellularly by perfusion, and the ramp protocol was applied for 16 additional min after ABA application for each cell. Student t-tests were performed for statistical analysis. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Analysis: Image Acquisition and Processing—Homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 10 days on half-strength MS medium under continuous light. Root pieces of seedlings were excised and incubated in the presence or absence of either 5 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) (33Bolte S. Brown S. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) during one night or with 1 mm propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) just before visualization. They were subsequently analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The emitted fluorescence was captured between 500 and 530 nm for GFP (green channel) and 620 and 750 nm for FM4-64, propidium iodide, and autofluorescence of chlorophyll (red channel) following excitation with a 488 nm argon laser line and an RSP500 dichroic beam splitter. Laser intensities were set to ∼40–50%, and intensities, gain, and offset adjustments were not changed when the specimens obtained from AtMRP5-GFP-expressing plant material were compared with corresponding wild-type samples. Stored images were false-colored in green (GFP) or red (FM4-64, propidium iodide, and chlorophyll autofluorescence) using Adobe Photoshop. Data Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using SSPS 11.5. AtMRP5 Is Localized in the Plasma Membrane—Localization studies of plant MRPs have revealed that these transporters can be targeted to the vacuolar as well as to the plasma membrane (34Liu G.

To determine the localization of AtMRP5, we used an enhanced version of GFP (GFP6) (25Humair D. Hernandez Felipe D. Neuhaus J.M. Paris N. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which was inserted at the C-terminal position of the gene. This particular position was chosen to minimize the interference with functional transmembrane domains of AtMRP5. Furthermore, four glycine residues were added between the last amino acids of AtMRP5 and the methionine of GFP6 to provide a linker allowing flexible movements of the GFP. Stably transformed, independent homozygous plant lines were used for localization studies. To determine whether AtMRP5 is correctly targeted, we investigated whether the expression of the AtMRP5-GFP fusion in the atmrp5-1 T-DNA disruption mutant restores the wild-type phenotype. The enhanced drought stress tolerance, the glibenclamide sensitivity of stomata, and shorter root length were analyzed. Deletion mutant lines expressing CaMV35S::AtMRP5-GFP exhibited a root length almost identical to the wild type and statistically different from atmrp5-1 plants (Fig. 1, A and B). Additionally, two complemented lines were used to analyze the response of stomata to the sulfonylurea compound glibenclamide. As previously observed, in atmrp5-1 plants, stomatal opening induced by glibenclamide was strongly impaired (Fig. 1C) (20Gaedeke N. Klein M. Kolukisaoglu H.U. Forestier C. Muller A. Ansorge M. Becker D. Mamnun Y. Kuchler K. Schulz B. Mueller-Roeber B. Martinoia E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast in four independent AtMRP5-GFP-expressing atmrp5-1 lines, glibenclamide-induced stomatal opening in the dark was restored (Fig. 1D). Finally, the AtMRP5-GFP-expressing atmrp5-1 lines showed drought-induced wilting similar to wild-type plants (Fig. 1E). These results demonstrate that AtMRP5-GFP fusion is functionally active and complements the atmrp5-1 disruption mutant phenotype. The complementation of three phenotypes by the AtMRP5-GFP-expressing atmrp5-1 lines allowed us to investigate the cellular localization of AtMRP5-GFP. Confocal microscope analysis of seedlings transformed with AtMRP5-GFP showed fluorescence at the periphery of cells, suggesting that the AtMRP5 protein is targeted to the plasma membrane. GFP fluorescence could be observed in different tissues of transgenic lines, e.g. in root (Fig. 2, A–D), leaves, and petals. To determine whether the observed fluorescence was associated with the vacuolar membrane or the cell wall, we used specific markers for these compartments. In case of the vacuole we used the fluorescence dye FM4-64 (37Betz W.J. Mao F. Bewick G.S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 363-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Betz W.J. Mao F. Smith C.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). It has been reported that, after 60-min incubation, FM4-64 reaches the vacuolar membrane of BY2 cells and that, between 3 and 10 h, all vacuolar membranes are stained (33Bolte S. Brown S. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 39Kutsuna N. Kumagai F. Sato M. Hasezawa S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), green fluorescence due to AtMRP5-GFP and red fluorescence due to FM4-64 were not overlapping, and the green fluorescence was located between two vacuolar membranes of adjacent cells. These observations demonstrate that AtMRP5-GFP is not located in the tonoplast. To exclude that the green fluorescence is emitted by the cell wall, we used propidium iodide (40Corliss D.A. White W.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a membrane-impermeant red fluorescent dye known to stain the cell wall. In this case the red fluorescence due to the propidium iodide and corresponding to the cell wall between neighboring cells was located between two layers of green fluorescence, due to AtMRP5-GFP and corresponding to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, C and D). These data provide evidence that AtMRP5-GFP is targeted to the plasma membrane. Confocal microscope analyses were also performed on isolated protoplasts from seedlings and leaves of homozygous plants of the T3 generation. As already shown at the plant level, the green fluorescence was restricted to the periphery of the protoplasts (Fig. 2, E–H) surrounding the red fluorescence emitted by the chloroplasts. The localization did not depend on the genetic background of the plants. Either wild-type or mutant plants transformed with the CaMV35S::AtMRP5-GFP showed the same localization of AtMRP5.

https://openalex.org/W2047883781,Some pathogenic bacteria actually invade the cytoplasm of their target host cells. Invasive bacteria acquire the propulsive force to move by recruiting actin and inducing its polymerization. Here we show that Shigella movement within the cytoplasm was severely hindered by microtubules and that the bacteria destroyed surrounding microtubules by secreting VirA by means of the type III secretion system. Degradation of microtubules by VirA was dependent on its α-tubulin–specific cysteine protease–like activity. virA mutants did not move within the host cytoplasm and failed to move into adjacent cells.

We examined the complete repertoire of genes expressed in the S. purpuratus embryo, up to late gastrula stage, by means of high-resolution custom tiling arrays covering the whole genome. We detected complete spliced structures even for genes known to be expressed at low levels in only a few cells. At least 11,000 to 12,000 genes are used in embryogenesis. These include most of the genes encoding transcription factors and signaling proteins, as well as some classes of general cytoskeletal and metabolic proteins, but only a minor fraction of genes encoding immune functions and sensory receptors. Thousands of small asymmetric transcripts of unknown function were also detected in intergenic regions throughout the genome. The tiling array data were used to correct and authenticate several thousand gene models during the genome annotation process."
https://openalex.org/W1972068895,"Glucocorticoids are well-established anti-inflammatory drugs thought to mainly act by inhibition of proinflammatory transcription factors like NF-kappaB. In recent years, however, transcription factor-independent mechanisms of glucocorticoid action have been proposed, namely the influence on MAPK pathways. Here we identify MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) as a pivotal mediator of the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids in the human endothelium. We applied dexamethasone (Dex) to TNF-alpha-activated human endothelial cells and used the adhesion molecule E-selectin as inflammatory read-out parameter. Dex is known to reduce the expression of E-selectin, which is largely regulated by NF-kappaB. Here, we communicate that Dex at low concentrations (1-100 nM) markedly attenuates E-selectin expression without affecting NF-kappaB. Importantly, Dex is able to increase the expression of MKP-1, which causes an inactivation of TNF-alpha-induced p38 MAPK and mediates inhibition of E-selectin expression. In endothelial MKP-1(-/-) cells differentiated from MKP-1(-/-) embryonic stem cells and in MKP-1-silenced human endothelial cells, Dex did not inhibit TNF-alpha-evoked E-selectin expression. Thus, our findings introduce MKP-1 as a novel and crucial mediator of the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids at low concentrations in the human endothelium and highlight MKP-1 as an important and promising anti-inflammatory drug target."

The cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) 4The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylylimido-diphosphate. family constitutes a highly conserved but functionally diverse family that is essential for many cellular regulatory processes, notably in the regulation of transcription and cell cycle progression (reviewed in Refs. 1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar and 2Oelgeschlager T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For full activity, CDKs absolutely require association with an activating cyclin molecule, and they may also require phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue that lies within the activation loop (Thr-160 in CDK2). Beyond these effects, CDKs are regulated by multiple mechanisms that include inhibitory phosphorylation of conserved residues within the active site (3Solomon M.J. Kaldis P. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 1998; 22: 79-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and binding of additional regulatory molecules (4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Early studies in Schizosaccharomyces pombe demonstrated that Cdc2 (CDK1) Tyr-15 phosphorylation directly regulates entry into mitosis and is an important element in the control of the unperturbed cell cycle (5Gould K.L.

Subsequent studies showed that in higher vertebrates the adjacent threonine residue (Thr-14) is also a site of inhibitory phosphorylation, (8Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 9Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation at either or both of these sites abrogates CDK1 kinase activity (5Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 9Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 10Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In human cells, the mechanism of inhibition of CDK1-cyclin complexes by phosphorylation is conserved and plays a major role in controlling passage through the G2/M transition point (reviewed in Ref. 11Takizawa C.G. Morgan D.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to be the exception in that phosphorylation of Tyr-19 is detectable (the residue equivalent to CDK1 Tyr-15) but its dephosphorylation is not a requirement for entry into mitosis, suggesting that other mechanisms must regulate the transition (12Amon A. Surana U. Muroff I. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1992; 355: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Sorger P.K. Murray A.W. Nature. 1992; 355: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CDK1 on Tyr-15 is catalyzed by members of the Wee1/Mik1 kinase family (14Featherstone C. Russell P.

In human cells there are three Cdc25 isoforms (Cdc25 A, B, and C). Initial characterization suggested that they had discrete and non-overlapping roles in regulating CDK activation. However, this model has had to be re-evaluated as an increasing body of evidence supports a model in which the three isoforms cooperate to regulate the major cell cycle transitions (reviewed in Ref. 23Boutros R. Dozier C. Ducommun B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Other members of the human CDK family that regulate the cell cycle (CDKs 2, 4, and 6) all contain a tyrosine residue equivalent to CDK1 Tyr-15, and phosphoforms of these CDKs, phosphorylated on this tyrosine residue, have been detected in cultured cell lines (24Gu Y.

Whether inhibitory phosphorylation is as crucial for their activities in the unperturbed cell cycle as it is for the activity of CDK1 is still unresolved. CDK2 is phosphorylated on Thr-14 and Tyr-15 during S and G2 phases and is dephosphorylated by Cdc25 (24Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 26Gabrielli B.G. Lee M.S. Walker D.H. Piwnica-Worms H. Maller J.L. J. Biol.

Indirect evidence suggests that this phosphorylation might regulate CDK2 activity in this context: modulation of Cdc25A activity either by ectopic overexpression (28Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or by immunodepletion (29Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) results, respectively, in an accelerated G1/S transition or in a G1/S block. As CDK2 is the major cell cycle regulator during these cell cycle transitions, it has been proposed that these effects are as a result of Cdc25A activity against CDK2. Indeed Cdc25A overexpression resulted in an increase in CDK2-cyclin A and cyclin E activity concomitant with CDK2 Tyr-15 dephosphorylation (30Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, recent work showing that CDK1 can substitute for CDK2 to promote S-phase, as revealed by experiments in CDK2-/-p27-/- cells (31Aleem E. Kiyokawa H. Kaldis P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), would suggest that further work is required to establish whether CDK2 and/or CDK1 is the essential Cdc25A target at G1/S. In contrast, the importance of CDK inhibition by phosphorylation in establishing cell cycle arrest in response to checkpoint activation is well documented. Active site phosphorylation of CDK1 (32Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 33Poon R.Y. Jiang W. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Exposure to transforming growth factor β results in a cell cycle arrest that is correlated with elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated CDKs 4 and 6 (25Iavarone A. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 387: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and that may be mediated by down-regulation of Cdc25A. Genetic and biochemical studies to dissect the effect of tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation on CDK activity have focused on CDK1 because of its established role in controlling entry into M-phase. In mouse cells, expression of a CDK1 (Y15E) mutant produces a dominant negative phenotype (9Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Similarly chicken mutants (CDK1(T14E), CDK1(Y15E), CDK1(T14D, Y15F), and CDK1(T14A, Y15D)) were unable to rescue fission yeast cells lacking wild-type CDK1 function and caused a cdc phenotype upon overexpression (7Krek W. Marks J. Schmitz N. Nigg E.A. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 43-53PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that negative charge at either position 14 or 15 is sufficient to inhibit kinase activity. Early biochemical studies suggested that Tyr-15-phosphoylated CDK1 is inactive (15Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Molecular models of CDK1 have suggested that a phosphate group located on Tyr-15 would present a steric and charge impediment to peptide substrate binding (41Marcote M.J. Knighton D.R. Basi G. Sowadski J.M. Brambilla P. Draetta G. Taylor S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5122-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Endicott J.A. Nurse P. Johnson L.N. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of suicide inhibitor labeling of Tyr-15-phosphorylated CDK1 has further suggested that phosphorylation of Tyr-15 might not inhibit ATP binding (43Atherton-Fessler S. Parker L.L. Geahlen R.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), an hypothesis supported by molecular modeling studies (44Bartova I. Otyepka M. Kriz Z. Koca J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Despite extensive x-ray crystallographic analysis of members of the CDK family, an atomic structure for a CDK in this phosphorylated state has not been described. In this report we present both the structure and the kinetic properties of CDK2-cyclin A phosphorylated on Tyr-15 and Thr-160. These results are discussed with respect to the molecular mechanism of CDK inhibitory phosphorylation and its physiological consequences. Purification of Phosphorylated CDK2-Cyclin A Complexes— T160pCDK2-cyclin A was purified as described (45Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A was purified by one of two methods. In the first method (Method 1), a modified pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) that independently expresses human CDK2 and the human Wee1 kinase catalytic domain (46McGowan C.H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (pGEX-6P-CDK2-Wee1) was transformed into Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3)/LysS. Notably, only GST-CDK2 contains a cleavage site for PreScission protease. GST-CDK2 and GST-Wee1 fusion proteins were purified together by affinity chromatography, and then GST-CDK2 was phosphorylated in vitro on Thr-160 by GST-CIV1 as described (47Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Lawrie A.M. Morris M.C. Tunnah P. Divita G. Johnson L.N. Endicott J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8746-8756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Following a buffer exchange step, the mixture of GST-Y15pT160pCDK2, GST-CIV1, and GST-Wee1 was re-applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Lysate from a culture of E. coli B834(DE3)/pLysS cells expressing a truncated version of human cyclin A (residues 174–432) (45Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) was passed over the column. The binary Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A complex, GST-Wee1, and GST-CIV1 were eluted with glutathione; the mixture was incubated with PreScission protease and then subjected to gel filtration (Superdex 75 HR26/60; Amersham Biosciences) followed by a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The binary complex was recovered in the flow-through, and any remaining GST-CIV1 or GST-Wee1 was retained on the final column. In the second method (Method 2), pGEX-6P-CDK2-Wee1 and a pACYC-derived vector to express GST-CIV1 were cotransformed into E. coli strain B834(DE3). This expression system produced CDK2 phosphorylated on Tyr-15 and Thr-160. The Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A complex was subsequently prepared by a modified method to that described for preparation of T160pCDK2-cyclin A (45Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Briefly, Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A was purified by sequential affinity (glutathione-Sepharose 4B), size-exclusion, and then affinity chromatography steps as described (45Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The sample was then enriched for Y15pT160pCDK2 by exploiting a GST-Cdc25A affinity column. The Cdc25A construct used (GST-Cdc25AC430S (336–523)) encodes glutathione S-transferase fused to Cdc25A residues 336 to 523 and is a substrate-trapping mutant in which the catalytic cysteine (Cys-430) is mutated to serine. The construct was expressed in E. coli strain B834(DE3), and an S100 lysate was prepared and loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column pre-equilibrated with HEPES-buffered saline. 10 mg of purified Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A was then applied to the GST-Cdc25AC430S(336–523) affinity column and washed to baseline with HEPES-buffered saline. Bound Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A was eluted with a gradient of dihydrogen ammonium phosphate (0–0.5 m). The eluted complex was buffer exchanged into HEPES-buffered saline and glycerol added to 50%. The inclusion of this additional affinity step in the purification procedure consistently enriched for Tyr-15-phosphorylated CDK2-cyclin A. Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A prepared by Method 2 was used for the ATPase assays and kinetic analysis. Analysis of Phosphorylated CDK2—The extinction coefficient (ϵ280) of T160pCDK2-cyclin A was determined by amino acid analysis. Subsequently, protein concentrations were determined from measured A280 values and an ϵ280 = 67420 m-1 cm-1. The extent of Tyr-15 phosphorylation was determined by N-terminal sequencing (described in supplemental information). Estimating the Extent of Phosphorylation of Tyr-15—The amount of amino acid liberated at each cycle of N-terminal sequencing was recorded for amino acid Gly-3 and for amino acids Gly-13 through Gly-19 in each of three separate sequencing runs of T160pCDK2-cyclin A (data presented in supplemental information for material prepared by Method 2, Table 1). Data for the different runs were placed on a common scale by dividing the amount of amino acid liberated at each cycle of a given run by the mean amount of amino acid liberated for cycles corresponding to Gly-3, Gly-13 through Thr-14, and Gly-16 through Tyr-19 of that run. The data were further normalized for cycle-to-cycle effects (principally expected to result from the relative efficiency of hydrolysis and derivatization of different amino acids) by dividing the scaled datum corresponding to a given cycle of a given run by the mean of the scaled data observed for that particular cycle in all runs. The variance of the resulting distribution of values, which should have a mean value of 1.0 for homogenous samples, is an estimate of the accuracy of the N-terminal sequencing protocol in determining the occupancy of the expected amino acid at any given sequence position. In this case, an accuracy of ± 0.11 was observed.TABLE 1Statistics of the datasets used and of the refined structuresY15pT160p CDK2-cyclinA-AMPPNPT160pCDK2-cyclinAaT160pCDK2-cyclin A and Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A crystals were grown in the presence of AMPPNP, cross-linked, and subsequently soaked in mother liquor supplemented with substrate peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures”Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclinAaT160pCDK2-cyclin A and Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A crystals were grown in the presence of AMPPNP, cross-linked, and subsequently soaked in mother liquor supplemented with substrate peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures”Cell dimensions (Å)a = 73.8, b = 133.2, c = 147.6a = 73.8, b = 133.2, c = 148.5a = 73.0, b = 133.6, c = 148.0Space groupP212121P212121P212121Maximum resolution (Å)2.33.23.2Observations490488223202207912Unique reflections, completeness (%)64652 (94.5)24761 (99.5)24165 (98.1)Rmerge (%)7.310.310.3Mean I/σ(I)4.22.62.6Highest resolution bin (Å):2.42-2.303.37-3.203.37-3.20Completeness (%)94.5100.0100.0Rmerge (%)bRmerge=∑h∑j|Ih,j-I¯h|∑h∑j|Ih,j| where Ih,j is the intensity of the jth observation of unique reflection h36.733.632.6Mean I/σ(I)1.92.31.9Statistics and model quality No. of protein atoms884090188856 No. of solvent molecules6584590 No. of peptide atoms0380 No. of AMPPNP atoms62062 Rfree (%)26.528.731.5 Rconv (%)cRconv=∑h‖Foh|-|Fch‖∑h|Foh| where Fo,h and Fc,h are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes for reflection h, k, l.

Run-to-run scaling was carried out as above, but the cycle-to-cycle scaling was performed using the scale factors determined for the singly phosphorylated sample. Correction by this method of the observed yields of unphosphorylated tyrosine at position 15 of the doubly phosphorylated samples yielded occupancies of 0.042 and 0.055, i.e. a mean of 0.049, with an S.E. of the mean of 0.077. ATPase Assay—The hydrolysis of ATP was monitored using a coupled spectrophotometric assay using material prepared by Method 2 as described previously (Refs. 48Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 49Stevenson L.M. Deal M.S. Hagopian J.C. Lew J.

Assay of the Kinetics of Phosphorylation of Histone H1 by T160pCDK2-Cyclin A and Y15pT160pCDK2-Cyclin A— T160pCDK2-cyclin A (5.2 nm, prepared by Method 2) was incubated with histone H1 substrate at varying concentrations in the range 6.25–100 μm. The kinase reaction was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP/Mg2+ (600 cpm/pmol) in a final reaction volume of 10 or 20 μl containing 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 0.01% monothioglycerol, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Triplicate reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 10 min before being terminated by the addition of 50% acetic acid. Phosphorylated histone was separated from free ATP by p81 paper cation exchange chromatography. Phosphate incorporation and hence the rates of reaction were determined by Cerenkov counting. The kinetic parameters from the data were determined by non-linear regression analysis. Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A was analyzed similarly except that a higher final enzyme concentration (1.6μm) and a higher substrate concentration range (up to 200μm) were used, reflecting the lower activity and higher Km of this sample. Analysis of the variation of initial rate with concentration of ATP for Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A suggested trace contamination of the sample with the more highly active T160pCDK2-cyclin A, particularly apparent at lower concentrations of substrate (Fig. 4). Regression analysis for this sample therefore used data from the higher concentration regime (50–200μm). Attempts to model the contribution of T160pCDK2-cyclin A to the kinetic data recorded from the Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A sample indicated a contamination of <1%, a value within the estimated accuracy of the amount indicated by N-terminal sequencing. Crystallization of Phosphorylated CDK2-Cyclin A Binary Complexes—Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A complex prepared by Method 1 in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl to 10 mg/ml and 5′-adenylylimido-diphosphate (AMPPNP) (Sigma) was added to an aliquot of the protein solution to a final concentration of 1 mm. Crystals were grown at 4 °C in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 m KCl, and 1.20 m (NH4)2SO4. Crystals of T160pCDK2-cyclin A-AMPPNP were grown under very similar conditions as previously described (45Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A native Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A-AMPPNP dataset was collected from a crystal that, although soaked in a substrate peptide solution (sequence PKTPKKAKKL), had no bound peptide. After failing to bind peptide to these crystals despite repeated attempts, protein cross-linking was used to allow soaking at higher peptide concentrations. The crystals (T160pCDK2-cyclin A-AMPPNP and Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A-AMPPNP) were first cross-linked for 30–60 min at 4 °C by gentle vapor diffusion of glutaraldehyde added to the well solution (0.1%) and then soaked for 15 min in mother liquor supplemented with 20 mm substrate peptide (HHASPRK, previously shown to bind to T160pCDK2-cyclin A) (45Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). For all data collection, crystals were briefly cryoprotected in 8 m sodium formate and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were integrated, scaled, and merged using the programs MOSFLM and SCALA. Statistics for the datasets are presented in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A-AMPPNP was solved by molecular replacement using the program Molrep via the CCP4 GUI (50Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr.

Several cycles of rigid body refinement were initially pursued using REFMAC5. Subsequent refinement was then pursued using REFMAC in conjunction with manual rebuilding using the programs O (52Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A detailed description of all steps in the structure determination and refinement procedure is provided in the supplemental information. Statistics for the final models are presented in Table 1. The Structure of CDK2-Cyclin A Phosphorylated on Tyr-15 and Thr-160—To provide a structural understanding of the role of Tyr-15 phosphorylation in regulating CDK activity we have determined the structure of a CDK2-cyclin A complex phosphorylated on Tyr-15 and Thr-160 (Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A) (Table 1) and characterized its catalytic activity (Table 2 and Fig. 4) A Cdc25A affinity column was found to be the most effective method to enrich for Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin A, and exploiting this method preparations were conservatively estimated to contain 95.1% ± 7.8% CDK2 phosphorylated on Tyr-15 (supplemental Table S1). In our early CDK2/Wee1 coexpression studies we detected low levels of Thr-160 phosphorylation by SDS-PAGE gel shift assay and subsequent dephosphorylation by kinase-associated phosphate (KAP) (results not shown). Using more sensitive protein sequencing techniques we did not detect any phosphorylation on Thr-14 (supplemental Table S1). Taken together, these results suggest that the isolated Wee1 catalytic domain retains a degree of selectivity for Tyr-15 but that in this in vitro system Thr-160, and not Thr-14, is additionally susceptible to phosphorylation.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for T160pCDK2-cyclin A and Y15pT160pCDK2-cyclin AParameterT160pCDK2-cyclin AY15pT160p CDK2-cyclin AFold change upon phosphorylationAverageS.D.nAverageS.D.nKinase activity (H1)34 Km (μm)281.978162.8 kcat (s–1)5.2(7)aPreviously reported values (54)0.40.080.0165 kcat/Km (μm–1 s–1)0.190.020.00100.0002190ATPase activity34 Km (μm)812072231.1 kcat (s–1)0.071 (0.2)aPreviously reported values (54)0.0090.0960.00731.3 kcat/Km (μm–1 s–1)0.000870.000240.00130.000141.5a Previously reported values (54Hagopian J.C.

In this report, we characterize the role of Wnt2 in mesoderm development during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation by creating ES cell lines in which Wnt2 was deleted. Wnt2-/- embryoid bodies (EBs) generated increased numbers of Flk1+ cells and blast colony-forming cells compared with wild-type EBs, and had higher Flk1 expression at comparable stages of differentiation. Although Flk1+ cells were increased, we found that endothelial cell and terminal cardiomyocyte differentiation was impaired, but hematopoietic cell differentiation was enhanced and smooth muscle cell differentiation was unchanged in Wnt2-/- EBs. Later stage Wnt2-/- EBs had either lower or undetectable expression of endothelial and cardiac genes compared with wild-type EBs. Consistently, vascular plexi were poorly formed and neither beating cardiomyocytes nor α-actinin-staining cells were detectable in later stage Wnt2-/- EBs. In contrast, hematopoietic cell gene expression was upregulated, and the number of hematopoietic progenitor colonies was significantly enhanced in Wnt2-/- EBs. Our data indicate that Wnt2 functions at multiple stages of development during ES cell differentiation and during the commitment and diversification of mesoderm: as a negative regulator for hemangioblast differentiation and hematopoiesis but alternatively as a positive regulator for endothelial and terminal cardiomyocyte differentiation.

However, manipulating the differentiation of pluripotent cells into a desired cell type is difficult to control. Therefore, efforts have been directed toward understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms for maintaining ES cell pluripotency as well as for ES cell fate determination and lineage specification. Under appropriate culture conditions, ES cells will spontaneously differentiate and form embryoid bodies (EBs) that recapitulate the differentiation program of normal embryonic development. This in vitro experimental model is widely used to study mesoderm development, including the hematopoietic system, vascular endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes (1Keller G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 2Wang R. Clark R. Bautch V.L. Development. 1992; 114: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Drab M. Haller H. Bychkov R.

Murine hematopoietic and endothelial cell development begins in the yolk sac mesoderm at approximately day 7.5 of gestation and is marked by establishment of blood islands (5Moore M.A. Metcalf D. Br.

The close physical relationship between these two cell populations within blood islands has led to a widely accepted hypothesis that a common precursor for both hematopoietic and endothelial cells exists, the hemangioblast (7Pardanaud L.

Genesis. 2003; 35: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Wnts are paracrine/autocrine signaling molecules that have been implicated in many aspects of normal development. Canonical Wnt signaling acts through β-catenin and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcriptional factors that regulate target gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 18He X. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 791-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and 19Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Developmental Wnt signaling is active during embryogenesis in the cardiac crescent and in endothelial cells during intraembryonic angiogenesis (20Maretto S. Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Braghetta P. Broccoli V. Hassan A.B. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Piccolo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3299-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Wnt ligands, receptors, and inhibitors are expressed by vascular cells and participate in both normal and pathologic vessel growth, yet the key players in these processes and their roles are not yet identified (reviewed in Ref. 21Goodwin A.M. D'Amore P.A. Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling also participates in hematopoiesis by providing proliferative signals for immature hematopoietic progenitors and promoting the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (22Van Den Berg D.J. Sharma A.K. Bruno E. Hoffman R. Blood. 1998; 92: 3189-3202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Reya T. Duncan A.W. Ailles L. Domen J. Scherer D.C. Willert K. Hintz L. Nusse R. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). Among the various Wnts, Wnt2 is localized to sites within the heart, vasculature, and associated mesoderm during development, making it a likely candidate to regulate mesoderm differentiation and subsequent hematovascular development (24McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Development. 1989; 107: 643-650PubMed Google Scholar, 25Monkley S.J. Delaney S.J. Pennisi D.J. Christiansen J.H. Wainwright B.J. Development. 1996; 122: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wnt2-/- mice have been generated and analyses of these mice indicate that Wnt2 is required for proper vascularization of extraembryonic tissues, although a complete assessment of hematovascular development was not performed (25Monkley S.J. Delaney S.J. Pennisi D.J. Christiansen J.H. Wainwright B.J. Development. 1996; 122: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, our inductive microarray studies indicate that Wnt2 is among the most highly up-regulated genes in Flk1+ cells during EB differentiation, suggesting that Wnt2 is the key Wnt signal for coordination of hemangioblast differentiation from primitive mesoderm. To extend these studies, we established ES cell lines carrying targeted mutations for Wnt2 to characterize mesoderm differentiation in EBs. Wnt2 plays critical roles in the commitment and diversification of mesoderm, acting as a positive signal for endothelial and cardiomyocyte differentiation but inhibiting hemangioblast differentiation and hematopoiesis, suggesting that manipulation of Wnt2 signals may be useful to tune stem cell differentiation for vascular applications. Generation of Wnt2 Mutant ES Cell Lines and ES Cell Culture—The R1 ES cell line heterozygous for the Wnt2 mutation (Wnt2+/neo) was previously described (25Monkley S.J. Delaney S.J. Pennisi D.J. Christiansen J.H. Wainwright B.J. Development. 1996; 122: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hygromycin (hygro-) targeting vector was constructed using strategies (outlined in Fig. 1) similar to that for the Neo-targeting vector (25Monkley S.J. Delaney S.J. Pennisi D.J. Christiansen J.H. Wainwright B.J. Development. 1996; 122: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hygro-targeting construct was electroporated into Wnt2+/neo ES cells. Homologous recombination occurring between the hygro-targeting vector and the wild-type allele replaces exon 2 of Wnt2 with the PGK-hygro cassette, resulting in a compound heterozygote (Wnt2hygro/neo). Hygro-resistant ES cell colonies were screened by PCR with a primer set indicated by arrows in Fig. 1. PCR-positive colonies were grown in G418-containing media and the subsequent G418-resistant colonies were analyzed by Southern blotting to confirm homologous recombination. Genomic DNA digested with SacI was probed by a 0.5-kb 3′ external fragment (indicated by a bar in Fig. 1). Of 117 colonies analyzed, two Wnt2hygro/neo (hereafter referred to as Wnt2-/-) ES cell colonies (G3 and D8) were obtained, and G3 was used in all of following experiments, although cells derived from both clones behaved identically in our assays. Wnt2+/+, Wnt2+/-, and Wnt2-/- ES cells were maintained on mitomycin-treated feeder cells in the presence of LIF. Cells were transferred to gelatin plates with 5637 cellconditioned medium as a source of LIF and passaged two times to remove feeder cells before the onset of differentiation. In vitro differentiation was performed as previously described (26Moser M. Binder O. Wu Y. Aitsebaomo J. Ren R. Bode C. Bautch V.L. Conlon F.L. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5664-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). FACS Analysis and Immunostaining—EBs were dissociated with trypsin and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Flk1 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) for FACS analysis of Flk1 expression. Cells were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) with Cytomation Summit software. For immunostaining, EBs were fixed in ice-cold methanol:acetone (50:50), blocked, and incubated with primary antibodies followed by appropriate secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies used were rat anti-PECAM-1 (MEC13.3, BD Pharmingen), mouse anti-α-actinin (EA-53, Sigma), and mouse anti-α-smooth muscle actin (1A4, Sigma). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed as previously described (27Wang H. Charles P.C. Wu Y. Ren R. Pi X. Moser M. Barshishat-Kupper M. Rubin J.S. Perou C. Bautch V. Patterson C. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with an Applied Biosystems 7700 Sequence Detection System using total RNA purified from EBs. Amplifications were performed in triplicate for 40 temperature cycles. Copy numbers of the mRNA template in each sample were calculated using the ABI Sequence Detector Software. Hemangioblast Colony and Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Assays—EBs were generated as described with some modification (28Chan R.J. Johnson S.A. Li Y. Yoder M.C. Feng G.S.

Briefly, ES cells were plated in 6-well dishes in differentiation medium containing Iscove-modified Dulbecco's medium, 15% differentiation fetal calf serum (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada), glutamine (2 mm), monothioglycerol (450 μm), holo-transferrin (500 μg/ml), and ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml). ES cells were plated at 50,000 cells/ml for day 4 EBs or 5,000 cells/ml for days 5-6 EBs, with an additional 5% protein-free hybridoma medium (Invitrogen). BL-CFCs, erythroid, and myeloid colonies were generated as described (28Chan R.J. Johnson S.A. Li Y. Yoder M.C. Feng G.S. Blood. 2003; 102: 2074-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Keller G.M. Webb S. Kennedy M. Klug C.A. Jordan C.T. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 209-230Google Scholar). For BL-CFC assays, day 4 EB cells were plated at 50,000 cells/ml in 1% methylcellulose with 10% differentiation fetal calf serum, 25% D4T cell-conditioned media (13Kennedy M. Firpo M. Choi K. Wall C. Robertson S. Kabrun N. Keller G. Nature. 1997; 386: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), c-kit ligand (1% conditioned medium), and VEGF (5 ng/ml, R & D Systems). Days 5 and 6 EB cells were plated at 50,000 cells/ml in 1% methylcellulose with 15% plasma-derived serum (Animal Technologies, Antech, TX), erythropoietin (20 units/ml) (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), kit ligand (1%), thrombopoietin (2% conditioned medium), transferrin (500 μg/ml), and 5% PFHM-II for primitive and definitive erythroid colony assays, or with 15% plasma-derived serum, erythropoietin (20 units/ml), c-kit ligand (1%), thrombopoietin (2%), 5% hybridoma medium, interleukin-3 (1% conditioned medium), and interleukin-11 (5 ng/ml, R&D Systems) for myeloid and mixed colony assays. Primitive and definitive erythroid colonies were counted after 4-6 days, and myeloid and mixed colonies were counted after 7-10 days. Production of Conditioned Media—We used a Drosophila S2 cell line expressing Wnt2 and a control S2 cell line, which were generous gifts from Roel Nusse (Stanford University). Wnt2 S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under selection with hygromycin (125 μg/ml) for 2-3 passages before collection of media. Increased Numbers of Flk1+ Cells and BL-CFC Frequency in Wnt2-deficient EBs—In a previously described set of gene expression profiling experiments (comparing gene expression profiles in Flk1+ cells versus Flk1- cells at different stages during ES cell in vitro differentiation), we found that Wnt2 expression was much higher in Flk1+ cells in comparison with Flk1- cells (27Wang H. Charles P.C. Wu Y. Ren R. Pi X. Moser M. Barshishat-Kupper M. Rubin J.S. Perou C. Bautch V. Patterson C. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This expression pattern was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis, which indicated that Wnt2 was expressed in early Flk1+ cells and undetectable in Flk1- cells, and was expressed in later stage Flk1- cells at much lower levels compared with Flk1+ cells (Fig. 1A). In a hierarchical clustering analysis for differentially expressed genes in Flk1+ versus Flk1- cells over time, Wnt2 was clustered closely with Flk1 and other genes related to mesoderm development such as Bmp4, Tgfb2, Hand1, and Gata6 (Fig. 1B). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that Wnt2 may participate in developmental events within the mesoderm that determine vascular and/or hematopoietic differentiation. Therefore, we initially evaluated the effects of Wnt2 on the early development of Flk1+ cells by creating Wnt2- ES cells (Fig. 1, C and D). We compared these cells to Wnt2+/- ES cells, similar to approaches that have been previously described for other targeted alleles in this system (10Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J. Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), because the Wnt2- and Wnt2+/- ES cells have been through identical selection processes and Wnt2+/+ ES cells lacking a selection marker cannot be brought through the same selection process. Nevertheless, Wnt2+/- ES cells differentiate in all of the lineages we characterize in these experiments with kinetics that mimic unselected Wnt2+/+ ES cells (see below), indicating that a phenotype due to heterozygosity for Wnt2 is either absent or extremely subtle. All the ES cells used in these studies maintained a highly undifferentiated state, as determined by Nanog expression and germ-line competency (data not shown). Days 3-4 (72, 82, and 96 h) Wnt2+/- and Wnt2-/- EBs were analyzed by FACS for their potential to generate Flk1+ cells. In Wnt2+/- EBs, the Flk1+ cell population was initially detected at around 82 h and it progressively increased in abundance to about 30% at 96 h (Fig. 2, A and B). These kinetics match those of Wnt2+/+ EBs found in our previous studies (27Wang H. Charles P.C. Wu Y. Ren R. Pi X. Moser M. Barshishat-Kupper M. Rubin J.S. Perou C. Bautch V. Patterson C. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), arguing against a significant phenotype due to lack of a single Wnt2 allele. In contrast, Wnt2-/- EBs generated Flk1+ cells in increased numbers and with accelerated kinetics. The Flk1+ cell population was detected as early as 72 h and increased dramatically to about 50% at 96 h in Wnt-/- EBs. Consistent with these observations, Flk1 mRNA was more abundantly expressed in days 3.5 and 4 EBs in Wnt2-/- ES cells as well (Fig. 2C). These experiments indicate that Wnt2 coordinates events within primitive cell populations that determine when and how mesoderm-derived cells such as those expressing Flk1+ appear. To assess the specificity of Wnt2 effects on mesoderm differentiation, we analyzed the expression of genes associated with ES cells and the three germ layer lineages (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) in Wnt2-/- and Wnt2+/- EBs during different stages of ES cell differentiation (Table 1, Fig. 2C). Oct4, which is expressed in the inner cell mass and in undifferentiated ES cells, was down-regulated with similar kinetics during differentiation in both Wnt2-/- and Wnt2+/- EBs. The mesoderm marker gene, Brachyury (T), was expressed at higher levels at day 3 in Wnt2-/- EBs (18.8-fold increase compared with mRNA levels in undifferentiated cells) compared with Wnt2+/- EBs (2.9-fold increase), and was also down-regulated more rapidly in Wnt2-/- EBs. Flk1 and another T-box gene that has been implicated in yolk sac development, Tbx3 (31Davenport T.G. Jerome-Majewska L.A. Papaioannou V.E. Development. 2003; 130: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), were similarly up-regulated early, but greatly reduced at later stages of Wnt2-/- EBs compared with Wnt2+/- EBs. In contrast to those mesoderm-associated genes, no significant difference was found for the ectoderm-associated marker neural cell adhesion molecule or the endoderm-associated gene α-fetoprotein in Wnt2-/- EBs compared with Wnt2+/- EBs. Therefore, the effects of Wnt2 on ES cell differentiation appear to be largely restricted to the mesoderm, and deficiency of Wnt2 promotes the early differentiation of mesoderm and dysregulates its terminal differentiation.TABLE 1Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of indicated mRNAs over time in Wnt2+/− and Wnt2−/− EBs (n = 3 per condition)0 Days2 Days3 Days3.5 Days4 Days6 Days8 Days10 DaysMeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.Wnt2+/−Flk11.00.01.00.21.40.32.50.718.32.124.93.714.45.39.33.4T1.00.02.10.12.90.56.91.216.73.19.12.01.40.21.10.2Oct43.20.73.90.83.80.53.60.43.60.83.30.61.20.31.00.0Wnt2−/−Flk11.00.01.10.22.10.421.35.337.74.831.63.928.51.96.92.0T1.00.01.90.418.81.322.23.715.01.81.80.21.60.31.30.1Oct43.81.04.00.63.30.63.10.73.00.62.60.51.10.21.00.0 Open table in a new tab The BL-CFC is an in vitro equivalent of the hemangioblast and is able to generate primitive and definitive hematopoietic cells as well as endothelial cells when cultured with appropriate growth factors (13Kennedy M. Firpo M. Choi K. Wall C. Robertson S. Kabrun N. Keller G. Nature. 1997; 386: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 14Choi K. Kennedy M. Kazarov A. Papadimitriou J.C. Keller G. Development. 1998; 125: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm the effects of Wnt2 on the differentiation of the early mesoderm-associated hemangioblast, we performed hemangioblast colony assays. Because maximum numbers of BL-CFCs are reached between days 3.25 and 4.25 during EB differentiation (13Kennedy M. Firpo M. Choi K. Wall C. Robertson S. Kabrun N. Keller G. Nature. 1997; 386: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), we plated cells of Wnt2+/- and Wnt2-/- EBs at day 4.0 in methylcellulose cultures in the presence of VEGF and c-kit ligand. BL-CFCs can be readily identified morphologically in distinction to secondary EBs (Fig. 2D). Compared with Wnt2+/- ES cells, the generation of BL-CFCs from Wnt2-/- ES cells was significantly enhanced. The production of secondary EBs from Wnt2-deficient cells was slightly, but not significantly, decreased. The increase in BL-CFC frequency in Wnt2-deficient ES cells coincides closely with the increase of Flk1+ cells by FACS analysis (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these experiments indicate that deficiency of Wnt2 enhances the differentiation and proliferation of ES cells to hemangioblasts. Wnt2 Affects the Differentiation of EBs to Endothelial Cells but Not SMC—Because Flk1+ hemangioblasts serve as vascular progenitors, we next investigated the role of Wnt2 in vascular development. Flk1 expression levels were reduced in Wnt2-/- EBs at day 10 (Fig. 2C), which coincides with attainment of the mature vascular phenotype and primitive vascular plexus formation in EBs (26Moser M. Binder O. Wu Y. Aitsebaomo J. Ren R. Bode C. Bautch V.L. Conlon F.L. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5664-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), indicating the possible impairment of terminal vascular development. Therefore, we performed RT-PCR for endothelial-specific genes including PECAM, VE-cadherin, and Tie2 at different time points during differentiation in Wnt2+/- and Wnt2-/- EBs (Table 2, Fig. 3A). These three endothelial markers were up-regulated with similar kinetics during differentiation over time (from day 6 to 10) in Wnt2+/- EBs, with peak levels at day 10 when the endothelial phenotype is maturing. However, this expression pattern was reversed in Wnt2-/- EBs, with peak levels 2-fold or greater above those seen in Wnt2+/- EBs in day 6 EBs and levels less than half of those seen in Wnt2+/- EBs at day 10 (Table 2). To further confirm the effect of Wnt2 on endothelial development, day 8 EBs were stained with a PECAM antibody to demarcate the vascular network. In Wnt2+/- EBs, well organized vascular plexi were formed, whereas only a few, scattered PECAM-positive cells were seen in Wnt2-/- EBs (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that the terminal differentiation of ES cells to endothelial cells is impaired in Wnt2-/- EBs.TABLE 2Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of endothelial mRNAs over time in Wnt2+/− and Wnt2−/− EBs (n = 3 per condition)0 Days2 Days3 Days3.5 Days4 Days6 Days8 Days10 DaysMeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.Wnt2+/−PECAM13.80.51.90.41.40.11.20.21.00.03.00.63.20.44.60.9VE-cad1.00.01.00.11.20.11.10.11.20.210.82.114.01.917.92.1Tie21.80.11.40.11.20.21.00.01.10.110.13.416.31.728.12.9Wnt2−/−PECAM14.30.51.60.21.60.31.20.21.00.05.61.03.90.81.70.3VE-cad1.00.01.20.21.20.21.20.12.00.224.33.619.92.89.83.0Tie22.00.11.50.11.10.11.00.01.90.524.83.517.31.96.11.3 Open table in a new tab SMC are periendothelial cells that are essential for vascular maturation and stabilization. Recent studies have shown that Flk1+ cells in EBs may also give rise to SMC under appropriate conditions (15Yamashita J. Itoh H. Hirashima M. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Yurugi T. Naito M. Nakao K. Nature. 2000; 408: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also performed expression analyses using molecular markers for SMC, including transcription factors involved in regulation of SMC differentiation (Mef2c and serum response factor) and contractile proteins smooth muscle (SM) α-actin, SM 22α, and SM myosin heavy chain, the latter of which is probably the most SMC-restricted gene. All of these markers showed very similar expression patterns, and no consistent differences were detected between Wnt2+/- and Wnt2-/- EBs during ES cell differentiation (Fig. 3A). To further confirm this observation, day 8 EBs were stained with aSM α-actin antibody. In support of the gene expression analyses, we saw no difference for SM α-actin staining between Wnt2+/- and Wnt2-/- ES cells (Fig. 3B). Therefore, Wnt2 is necessary for hemangioblast development as well as further differentiation to endothelial cells but probably not for SMC differentiation, whether or not these SMCs derive from Flk1+ cell populations. Wnt2-deficient EBs Have Impaired Cardiomyocyte Differentiation—Cardiomyocytes are also mesoderm-derived and recent data indicate that Flk1+ cells may give rise to some populations of cardiomyocytes (16Yamashita J.K.

Rossant J. Sato T.N. Genesis. 2003; 35: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, Wnt2 expression is detected in precardiac mesoderm and derived structures such as the pericardium from as early as 7.5 days post-conception forward (24McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Development. 1989; 107: 643-650PubMed Google Scholar, 25Monkley S.J. Delaney S.J. Pennisi D.J. Christiansen J.H. Wainwright B.J. Development. 1996; 122: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Wnt signaling is generally required for normal cardiogenesis (32Tzahor E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 33Marvin M.J. Di Rocco G. Gardiner A. Bush S.M. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Wnt2 had any effect on in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation in the ES differentiation model, where the differentiation and formation of beating cardiomyocytes occurs in later stage EBs (days 8 and 10). First, we analyzed Wnt2+/- and Wnt2-/- EBs at different time points for their expression of specific cardiomyocyte markers: the cardiogenic transcription factors, GATA4 and Nkx2.5, and cardiac-specific proteins, α- and β-myosin heavy chain and ventricular-specific myosin light chain-2v. In Wnt2+/- EBs, these genes were all up-regulated over time during differentiation (Table 3, Fig. 3A). In comparison, GATA4 and Nkx2.5 were expressed, but at reduced levels, after day 6 in Wnt2-/- EBs. Moreover, whereas we readily detected greater than 20-fold induction of cardiacspecific proteins α- and β-myosin heavy chain and myosin light chain-2v in later Wnt2+/- EBs (days 6 to 10), minimal quantitative induction of these genes was detected in later Wnt2-/- EBs (Table 3). Consistent with a major defect in the terminal stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation, we did not observe the formation of spontaneously beating clusters in any Wnt2-/- EBs after 8-10 days culture, whereas these beating clusters were easily detected in all Wnt2+/- EBs. Similarly, when we stained day 8 EBs with an antibody for α-actinin, a marker for cardiomyocytes, we found α-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes in Wnt2+/- EBs but no stained cells were found in"

While hTR is ubiquitously expressed, hTERT is normally restricted to germ cells and certain stem cells, but both are often deregulated during tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated the effects of changes in hTR cellular levels. Surprisingly, while inhibition of hTR expression triggers a rapid, telomerase-independent, growth arrest associated with p53 and CHK1 activation, its increased expression neutralizes activation of these pathways in response to genotoxic stress. These hTR effects are mediated through ATR and are sufficiently strong to impair ATR-mediated DNA-damage checkpoint responses. Furthermore, in response to low UV radiation, which activates ATR, endogenous hTR levels increase irrespective of telomerase status. Thus, we uncovered a novel, telomerase-independent, function of hTR that restrains ATR activity and participates in the recovery of cells from UV radiation.

Most human somatic cells have a limited replicative lifespan when propagated in vitro which is due to their inability to maintain chromosome ends, the telomeres (1Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. Exp.

Telomeres are specialized DNA-protein structures that preserve the integrity of the ends of the chromosomes and the stability of the genome (2Cong Y.S. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

However, with each cell division telomeres are shortened and once one or more erode to a certain critical point, the shortening induces a DNA damage checkpoint, thereby posing a barrier to continued cell growth and, therefore, to cancer (3Harley C.B.

Cells that escape replicative senescence by inactivating critical cell cycle checkpoint genes, such as p53, continue to erode their telomeres, eventually reaching a point that is called crisis (9Shay J.W.

In humans, the core components of the telomerase complex are the protein catalytic subunit hTERT and the telomerase RNA subunit hTR (14Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V.

Its secondary structure is very well conserved with telomerase RNAs from several vertebrate species, indicating an important role for RNA structure in telomerase function (19Chen J.L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Several proteins have been described to bind to hTR and these are involved in hTR stability, maturation, accumulation, and functional assembly of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex (2Cong Y.S. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66 (table of contents): 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Certain mutations or deletions in hTR lead to a rare skin and bone marrow failure syndrome called dyskeratosis congenita, which is believed to be caused by defective telomere maintenance in stem cells (20Mitchell J.R.

Nature. 2001; 413: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). As expression of hTR has been found to be essential for telomere maintenance in human disease and also for telomere length maintenance in mouse models, it is expected to be up-regulated in cancer cells (22Chiang Y.J.

Indeed, several studies have shown that hTR up-regulation is an early event in tumorigenesis and that hTR levels correlate better to tumor grade than telomerase activity or hTERT expression (23Soder A.I.

Oncol. 2005; 23: 9138-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of hTR was also found to be an early event in mouse models of tumorigenesis. Here, telomerase RNA levels did not parallel the amount of telomerase activity detected (32Blasco M.A. Rizen M. Greider C.W. Hanahan D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 33Broccoli D. Godley L.A. Donehower L.A. Varmus H.E. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3765-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These studies show that even in tumors that lacked telomerase activity, telomerase RNA was up-regulated. Therefore, hTR may have functions that are separable from its role in telomerase activity (32Blasco M.A. Rizen M. Greider C.W. Hanahan D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Contrasting these observations are mice in which mouse telomerase RNA (mTR) was deleted from the germ line. These mice are viable for six generations until telomeres have completely eroded (34Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). However, the first generation of these mice, which still have long telomeres, have less skin tumors than wild-type mice following skin chemical carcinogenesis, indicating for some telomerase-independent effects of mTR (35Gonzalez-Suarez E. Samper E. Flores J.M. Blasco M.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This argues that most mTR function is dependent on telomerase. However, as germ line gene knock-out may allow for compensating events to occur while acute inhibition in somatic cells may not (36Sage J. Miller A.L. Perez-Mancera P.A. Wysocki J.M. Jacks T. Nature. 2003; 424: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), inhibition of telomerase RNA by RNA interference in cancer cell lines may expose its telomerase independent functions. Telomeres are intimately linked with DNA damage responses. Dysfuctional telomeres are recognized as damaged DNA and directly associate with many DNA damage response proteins (37d'Adda di Fagagna F. Teo S.-H. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1781-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Moreover, the main cellular transducers of DNA damage, ATM and, to a lesser extent, ATR, have been shown to play an important role in telomere homeostasis (38Takata H. Kanoh Y. Gunge N. Shirahige K. Matsuura A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 515-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Verdun R.E. Crabbe L. Haggblom C. Karlseder J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). ATM and ATR are phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinases (PIKKs) that coordinate the repair, cell cycle checkpoint, and apoptotic responses to DNA damage (40Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). Loss of ATM causes telomere decapping and shortening in every organism investigated thus far, and TRF2, a telomeric DNA binding protein, has been shown to bind and inhibit ATM activation (37d'Adda di Fagagna F. Teo S.-H. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1781-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 41Karlseder J. Hoke K. Mirzoeva O.K. Bakkenist C. Kastan M.B. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E240Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Probing a telomeric function for ATR in mammalian cells has not been possible since ATR is essential for cell viability (42Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent report has shown that in Arabidopsis ATR is required for maintenance of telomeric DNA (43Vespa L. Couvillion M. Spangler E. Shippen D.E. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2111-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, PIKKs function in telomere homeostasis and telomeres with their telomere-associated factors influence PIKKs activity. Telomerase and telomeres are attractive targets for cancer therapies and have been extensively explored to this end (2Cong Y.S. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66 (table of contents): 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Inhibition of telomerase by antisense strategies or a dominant negative hTERT protein leads to the expected telomere shortening, although the growth inhibition induced by this mechanism requires a long lag period due to the number of cell divisions required for telomeres to become substantially shortened to induce growth arrest (44Hahn W.C. Stewart S.A. Brooks M.W. York S.G. Eaton E. Kurachi A. Beijersbergen R.L. Knoll J.H. Meyerson M. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 45Herbert B. Pitts A.E. Baker S.I. Hamilton S.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Corey D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14276-14281Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Recently, some studies have reported rapid cytotoxic responses of cancer cell lines in response to low levels of hTERT and hTR. A novel telomere-independent growth inhibitory response pathway was proposed (46Li S. Crothers J. Haqq C.M. Blackburn E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23709-23717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 47Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the effects exerted by hTR on the cellular growth and checkpoint controls and uncovered a novel, telomerase-independent, function of hTR to counterbalance the activity of endogenous ATR. Materials and Antibodies—UV radiation was performed with a Stratalinker (Stratagene), and ionizing irradiation was performed with a 2 × 415-Ci137Cs source. Prior to UV radiation, medium was reserved, and cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Antibodies used in this study were directed against cdk4 (C-22), p53 (DO1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Ser-15 p53, phospho-Ser-317 Chk1, phospho-T68 Chk2 (Cell Signaling), FLAG (M2, Sigma), γ-H2AX (Ser-139, Upstate Biotechnology), and ATR (ab2905, Abcam). Constructs—hTR knockdown constructs were cloned in pSuper, pRetroSuper(pRS)-Hygro (48Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), and pRS-GFP (49Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The sequences used were as follows: hTRkd#1, GTCTAACCCTAACTGAGAAGG; hTRkd2, CCGTTCATTCTAGAGCAAAC; hTRkd3, GAGTTGGGCTCTGTCAGCC. The CMV-hTR expression construct was cloned by PCR in pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) to contain 149 nucleotides downstream of the full-length hTR for proper processing; H/ACA box snoRNA constructs were also cloned into this vector. pRS-p53kd and pRS-Rb were described previously (49Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). ATRkd sequences used were as follows: #1, GACGGTGTGCTCATGCGGC; #2, CCTGATGGAGTGGCCGGAG; we used a combination of the two constructs cloned in pSuper. We cloned the ATR cDNA from the pBJ5.1-Flag-ATR (a kind gift from Professor Steve Jackson) vector into the pZome1N vector (Cellzome) downstream of the TAP tag (50Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). The GST-p53 (amino acids 1-101) construct was cloned by PCR into pGEX-1N (Amrad). pTRI-GAPDH and -cyclophilin constructs for the RNase protection assay (RPA) were from Ambion, and the hTR RPA vector was cloned by PCR into pTRI (Ambion) from nucleotides 105-370 in reverse orientation. Cell Culture, Retroviral Transduction, and Transfection—All cells described here were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. BJ cells were transduced at population doubling 35. The generation of BJ-tert cells has been described previously (49Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); GM847 cells were a kind gift from Professor Batsheva Kerem. MCF7, U2OS, and TIG3 cell lines expressing the ecotropic receptor were infected with ecotropic retroviral supernatants as described previously (48Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) to generate polyclonal pools of cells. Except for kinase assays, transfection was done by electroporation as described previously (51Agami R. Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). For kinase assays, HEK293, U2OS, and MCF7 cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation. Western Blotting, Cell Cycle Profile Analysis, and Competitive Growth Assays—For Western blot analysis, whole-cell extracts were prepared and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and ATR immunoblots were separated on 5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Milipore). Western blots were developed with Supersignal (Pierce), and densitometric quantitation of Western blots was performed with Aida 3.40 software (Raytek, Sheffield, UK). Cell cycle profile analysis was performed as described before by Duursma et al. (52Duursma A. Agami R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6937-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For competitive growth assays, cells were infected with pRS-GFP-hTRkd or pRS-GFP retrovirus and allowed to recover for 4 days; the initial percentage of GFP-positive cells varied between 15 and 50%. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with the CellQuest program (BD Bioscience). Telomerase Activity Assays, Quantitative RT-PCR, and RNase Protection Assays—MCF7 extracts were assayed for telomerase activity using a PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay (53Kim N.W. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, cDNA was transcribed using SuperSCRIPT III (Invitrogen) with random hexamers following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed with a SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems), and the samples were amplified and analyzed by an ABI-prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primers for OAS1 (2′5′-oligoadenylate synthetase) were described before (54Scherr M. Battmer K. Schultheis B. Ganser A. Eder M. Gene Ther. 2005; 12: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Ct values were normalized for β-actin. RPAs were performed using the HybSpeed RPA and MAXIscript kits from Ambion according to manufacturer's instructions. We used 5-8 μg of RNA per reaction. In vitro transcription of pTRI-hTR yielded an RNA of 300 nucleotides, 265 nucleotides of which are complementary to hTR. Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assays—To determine ATR activity, TAP-ATR was immunoprecipitated from extracts of transfected HEK293, MCF7, or U2OS cells using rabbit IgG-Sepharose (Sigma). Prior to immunoprecipitation, cells were UV irradiated with either 80 or 20 J/m2 or mock treated. Beads were washed three times with ELB lysis buffer (125 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5 mm NaOV, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and ATR was cleaved from the beads by addition of recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 8°C according to manufacturer's instructions. The substrate, GST-p53-(1-101) bound to glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences), was washed three times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm NaOV, and 2 mm β-glycerophosphate). Reactions were carried out in a 50-μl volume of kinase buffer with cleaved ATR, 10 μg of GST-p53-(1-101), 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (500 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) at 30 °C for 15 min. In samples with RNase A, 0.5 μg was added to the kinase reaction prior to the addition of the substrate; we added 1 μg of in vitro transcribed hTR or H/ACA snoRNA to the indicated samples, which was produced from linearized CMV-hTR/snoRNA plasmid with a MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions. The beads with GST-p53-(1-101) were then extensively washed and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried, stained with Coomassie Blue, and exposed to a phospho imager screen for quantitation on a Basreader 3000 (Fuji) with Aida 3.40 software (Raytek, Sheffield, UK). Immunofluorescence, Mitotic Entry, and Fragile Site Assays—MCF7 cells were transfected by electroporation (>90% efficiency) with the indicated constructs. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed, permeabilized in 4% formaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100, and washed with PBS containing 0.05% saponin. Slides were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.05% saponin. Cells were stained with antibody directed against phosphorylated H2AX; fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Images were recorded with a Leica TCS SP2-AOBS (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) confocal system. For counting mitotic entry, after 72 h, transfected MCF7 cells were treated with 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR) or mock treated and incubated with nocodazole (0.25 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and stained with Hoechst. Mitotic cells were scored double blind with a Zeiss RS III microscope. For each sample, 600 cells were counted. For fragile site assays, cells were grown on coverslips, and common fragile sites were induced by growing the cells in M-199 medium in the presence of 0.4 μm aphidicolin and 0.5% ethanol, for 24 h prior to the fixation of chromosomes by standard procedures. Images were obtained with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV inverted microscope controlled by SmartCapture2 software. For each sample, 400 chromosomes were counted double blind. Inhibition of hTR Expression Induces a Rapid Cellular Growth Arrest—To inhibit hTR expression we designed shRNA constructs to target sequences in different regions of the hTR molecule. We aimed our constructs to three distinct single stranded (loops) regions of the hTR molecule, as predicted by its very strong and conserved secondary structure (19Chen J.L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To assess the efficacy of inhibition of hTR expression, we transfected MCF7 breast carcinoma cells with the shRNA constructs or a vector control. We used RPA with RNA probes partially complementary to hTR or cyclophilin control to assess hTR RNA levels in cell extracts (Fig. 1B). Quantitative analysis revealed that hTRkd#1 and hTRkd#2 reduced the levels of endogenous hTR to 19 and 67%, respectively, whereas no hTR reduction was seen by hTRkd#3. U2OS osteosarcoma cells, which lack expression of hTR and hTERT but maintain their telomeres by ALT (55Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Dalla-Pozza L. Dunham M.A. Reddel R.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 56Scheel C. Schaefer K.L. Jauch A. Keller M. Wai D. Brinkschmidt C. van Valen F. Boecker W. Dockhorn-Dworniczak B. Poremba C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), were used as a control. Indeed, no hTR expression was observed in U2OS cells, which could be re-expressed through transfection of a CMV-hTR plasmid (Fig. 1B). We also verified the extent of hTR knockdown in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts to exclude knockdown of hTR only in cytoplasmic fractions (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). We found that hTR resides mainly in the nucleus, and upon expression of hTRkd#1, hTR levels in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were dramatically decreased. To assess the effects of inhibition of hTR on telomerase activity we performed a TRAP assay with extracts of MCF7 cells transfected with the hTRkd constructs or control plasmid. As expected we found almost no telomerase activity in hTRkd#1-transfected cells, and hTRkd#2 gave a moderate reduction, whereas hTRkd#3 did not inhibit telomerase activity.FIGURE 1Reduction of telomerase activity and rapid growth inhibition by reduction of hTR expression. A, schematic representation of the hTR RNA. Boxed regions correspond to targeted sequences by shRNAs 1, 2, and 3, and the template sequence is shown in a closed box. B, RPA was used to detect the levels of hTR and the control cyclophilin. The full-length probes and protected fragments are indicated, and 10% of the input probe was loaded on the gel. Quantification was performed by densitometry. C, a TRAP assay was performed to detect telomerase activity in extracts of MCF7 cells transfected with the indicated constructs. D, MCF7 cells were transfected with hTRkd#1 or vector constructs and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2 phases are shown. S.D. is from three independent experiments. E, a colony growth assay of MCF7 cells transfected with the hTR knockdown constructs or a vector control. Cells were selected with hygromycin for 10 days and stained with Coomassie Blue. F, colony growth assay of virally transduced MCF7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2021580403,"Epithelial tubes are essential for the proper function of a diverse array of eukaryotic organs. Here we present a novel class of genes required for maintaining epithelial cell shape, polarity, and paracellular barrier function in the Drosophila embryonic tracheal system. Mutations in one member of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family (pgant35A) are recessive lethal and result in tracheal tubes that are irregular in diameter and morphology. Further analysis of the pgant35A mutants reveals diminished levels of the apical determinant Crbs and the luminal marker 2A12, concomitant with increased staining in cytoplasmic vesicles within tracheal cells. GalNAc-containing glycoproteins are severely diminished along the apical region of the tracheal system as well. Tracheal cells become irregular in size and shape, and septate junction proteins are mislocalized to a more apical position. Most notably, paracellular barrier function is lost in the tracheal system of the mutants. Overexpression of wild type pgant35A under control of the trachea-specific breathless (btl) promoter results in partial rescue of the lethality. We propose a model where pgant35A is required to establish proper apical composition of tracheal cells by influencing apical delivery of proteins/glycoproteins. Disruption of the normal apical content results in altered cell morphology and loss of paracellular barrier function. These studies demonstrate a previously unrecognized requirement for mucin-type O-glycosylation in epithelial tube integrity and have obvious implications for epithelial morphogenesis in higher eukaryotes, since a unique ortholog to pgant35A exists in mammals.

Epithelial tubes are crucial components of higher eukaryotic organs, such as the kidney, lung, salivary gland, and vascular system. Tube length and diameter control are critical, since tubes of irregular size or shape may be unable to transport fluids or gases efficiently and may lack the proper surface to volume ratio necessary for appropriate exchange of materials (1Lubarsky B.

Additionally, the proper establishment of cell junctions to form a diffusion barrier across the tube surface is required to prevent loss of materials and inappropriate introduction of others from the surrounding environment. The Drosophila tracheal system has served as a model system for epithelial tube formation and has aided in elucidating factors important for tube morphogenesis in mammalian systems (1Lubarsky B.

Along the lateral surfaces, septate junctions are functionally analogous to vertebrate tight junctions and are responsible for establishing the transepithelial diffusion barrier of the tracheal tube (2Wu V.M.

Additionally, septate junctions influence cell shape and tube size, since some septate junction proteins have been found to limit the extent of apical cell surface formation (16Woods D.F. Hough C.

All of these studies point to an incredibly complex interplay of many components to ensure proper cell polarity, morphology, and epithelial barrier formation. Although many genes controlling tracheal tube morphogenesis have been identified, many more factors involved in these processes are still unknown. Here, we provide the first demonstration that mucin-type protein O-glycosylation is required for proper tracheal tube formation and function. The synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans is initiated by the UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family (ppGalNAcTs or ppGaNTases in mammals and pgants in Drosophila) (EC 2.4.1.41). This enzyme family is evolutionarily conserved and catalyzes the transfer of the sugar GalNAc onto the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues of secreted and membrane-bound proteins, laying the foundation for the formation of more complex sugar structures that can be further elaborated (Fig. 1, A and B) (reviewed in Refs. 22Ten Hagen K.G.

Chem. 2005; 13: 5021-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that one member of this family is essential for viability in Drosophila (pgant35A) (24Ten Hagen K.G.

Surprisingly, we find that mucin-type O-glycans are abundant on the apical surface and lumen of tracheal tubes and are required for proper epithelial cell morphology, polarity, and paracellular barrier formation within the developing Drosophila tracheal system. This study will aid in elucidating the role of this posttranslational modification in mammalian systems, since a distinct mammalian ortholog to pgant35A exists and is expressed in tissues dependent upon epithelial function. Drosophila Crosses—The mutants used in this study were described previously (24Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22616-22622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and are as follows: pgant35AHG8, pgant35ASF32, and pgant35A3775 (Fig. 1C). Mutants were balanced over CyO or CyO, P{w+ = ActGFP}JMR1 as described previously (24Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22616-22622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Crosses between heterozygotes carrying different allelic mutations and crosses to obtain germ line clones (GLCs) of pgant35AHG8 and pgant35ASF32 are described in the supplemental data. The pUAST plasmid (26Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to generate Gal4-inducible constructs that were then used to create transgenic flies. The complete coding region from the wild type pgant35A cDNA was removed from the plasmid, FlyH-2a, on ApaI (blunt)/NotI ends and cloned into the EcoRI (blunt)/NotI sites of pUAST. Transformants were produced by Genetic Services Inc. (Cambridge, MA) using a methodology based on the procedure described previously (27Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar, 28Spradling A.C. Rubin G.M. Science. 1982; 218: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Rescue experiments were performed using transgenic flies (w; P{UAS-pgant35A#5}/P {UAS-pgant35A#5}) with insertions on the third chromosome and the following stocks: w; btl-Gal4/TM3, Ser (29Shiga Y. Tanaka-Matakatsu M. Hayashi S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1996; 38: 99-106Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (kind gift of D. Andrew); Bloomington stock #5138 (y1, w*; P{tubP-GAL4}LL7/TM3, Sb1); and a stock from J. Kennison, w; TM6C, cu, Sb, e, ca/Su(Tpl)s1, red, e. All stocks used in the rescue experiments were first crossed into pgant35Amutant backgrounds to generate both Gal4 driver lines and P{UAS-pgant35A} transgenic lines heterozygous for pgant35Amutant/CyO. These heterozygous lines were then crossed as follows, and rescue of the pgant35A lethality was assessed by the presence of straight winged, Sb+ progeny: pgant35Amutant/CyO; P{UAS-pgant35A#5}/P{UAS-pgant35A#5} females × pgant35Amutant/CyO; P{tubP-GAL4}LL7/TM6C, cu, Sb, e, ca males. The same crossing scheme was used with the btl-Gal4 driver line. The total population of stage 16-17 embryos from the btl-Gal4 crosses was stained with 2A12, and the ratio of those with straight (“normal”) to curved (“abnormal”) dorsal longitudinal tracheal trunks was calculated. Rescue of the pgant35A lethality by btl-driven pgant35A expression was assessed by the presence of straight winged, Sb+ adult progeny. Whole Mount Antibody Staining and Lectin Staining—Embryos homozygous for pgant35A mutations were selected by lack of GFP fluorescence and fixed as previously described (30Tian E. Ten Hagen K.G. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was according to standard procedures. The following antibodies from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank were used at the indicated concentrations: 2A12 (1:5) (31Samakovlis C. Hacohen N. Manning G. Sutherland D.C. Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Development. 1996; 122: 1395-1407PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Crumbs (Cq4) (1:100), anti-Dlg (4F3) (1:50), anti-DE-cadherin (DCAD2) (1:25), anti-Armadillo (N2 7A1) (1:100), and anti-α-spectrin (3A9) (1:25). Mouse monoclonal anti-Tn antibody (Ca3638) (32Avichezer D. Springer G.F. Schechter B. Arnon R. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (1:50) was a kind gift of Dr. Richard D. Cummings, who had acquired the stocks of antibodies and hybridomas from the late Dr. Georg F. Springer. The rabbit anti-Sinuous serum (1:500) was a generous gift of G. Beitel; heat-fixed embryos were used for Sinuous staining (19Wu V.M. Schulte J. Hirschi A. Tepass U. Beitel G.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). All secondary antibodies (Biotin-, fluorescein isothiocyanate-, and Cy3-conjugated) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and used at concentrations of 1:2000 (Biotin-conjugated) and 1:100 (fluorescence-conjugated). The fluorescence-conjugated lectins, Artocarpus integrifolia (Jacalin), Arachis hypogea (peanut agglutinin), Vicia villosa agglutinin, and Triticum vulgare (wheat germ agglutinin) were purchased from EY Laboratories. Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated Glycine maximus (soybean agglutinin) was purchased from Molecular Probes. All lectins were used at 10 μg/ml. Fluorescein-conjugated chitin-binding probe was purchased from Bio-Labs and used at a 1:500 dilution. Stained embryos were staged according to Hartenstein (33Hartenstein V. Atlas of Drosophila Development. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 2-52Google Scholar) and analyzed with the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Images were processed using the LSM Imager Browser and Photoshop. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Probe synthesis and whole mount RNA in situ hybridizations were performed as described previously (30Tian E. Ten Hagen K.G. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except proteinase K (Sigma; 3 μg/ml) was used to penetrate embryos for 2 min at room temperature and 1 h on ice. Primary antibody against the protein of interest was added along with the anti-digoxygenin antibody. Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect the primary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated digoxygenin was amplified by tyramide signal amplification (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (1:50). Stained embryos were analyzed by confocal microscopy as described above. Transepithelial Barrier Dye Permeability Assay—Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated 10-kDa dextran (Molecular Probes) was injected into the posterior cavity of stage 16-17 dechorionated embryos as described previously (17Lamb R.S. Ward R.E. Schweizer L. Fehon R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3505-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The embryos were examined by confocal microscopy. pgant35A Is Required during Early Pupation and Embryogenesis—To examine the stage at which homozygous pgant35A mutants die, we crossed two heterozygous strains containing distinct pgant35A allelic mutations. Two of these previously characterized mutants (pgant35AHG8 and pgant35A3775) contain point mutations in the coding region of pgant35A, resulting in stop codons that delete all or most of the catalytic region and render the enzymes inactive (Fig. 1C) (24Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22616-22622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The third mutant (pgant35ASF32) contains a missense mutation, changing a conserved arginine to a tryptophan and severely diminishing enzymatic activity (Fig. 1C) (24Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22616-22622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Each pgant35A allele was balanced over a wild type chromosome carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the actin promoter (Act5C-GFP), allowing us to identify homozygous mutant pgant35A progeny by lack of GFP fluorescence. Results from three crosses using the previously characterized pgant35A mutants demonstrated that substantial portions of pgant35A/pgant35A homozygous mutants arrest during embryogenesis (13-27%) and larval development (27-36%) (Table 1). Those homozygous mutants that continue to pupation never proceed past pupal stage P4ii (when the head sac is everted), with most arresting during prepupal stages P1-P4 (when histolysis is occurring, prior to imaginal leg and wing disc eversion). These results indicate that pgant35A is required to complete pupation and also plays a role during embryonic and larval development.TABLE 1Percentage survival of progeny from pgant35A heterozygous mutant crossesGenotypeEmbryos hatching to larvaeLarvae that pupatePupae that eclose%%%w; pgant35AHG8/pgant35ASF3273 (n = 176)73 (n = 218)0 (n = 161)w; pgant35AHG8/pgant35A377587 (n = 209)69 (n = 312)0 (n = 218)w; pgant35ASF32/pgant35A377580 (n = 134)64 (n = 239)0 (n = 155) Open table in a new tab Expression of Wild Type pgant35A Rescues Lethality—To conclusively demonstrate that mutations in the pgant35A gene are responsible for the lethality observed, we constructed transgenic flies containing a wild type pgant35A cDNA under the control of the UAS promoter (UAS-pgant35A transgenic line) and crossed these with the tubulin promoter-Gal4 driver transgenic line in the mutant backgrounds. As mentioned earlier, homozygous mutants derived from the heterozygous cross die throughout development but never proceed past pupation. Expression of wild type pgant35A cDNA under the control of the tubulin-Gal4 driver (which is expressed ubiquitously) resulted in rescue of the lethality in 86% of the homozygous mutant progeny. Rescued progeny were viable and fertile. Additionally, the expected number of wild type heterozygous progeny expressing the tubulin-Gal4-driven pgant35A cDNA were also seen, indicating that overexpression of pgant35A did not have any obvious effect on viability or fertility. These experiments conclusively demonstrate that the pgant35A gene is responsible for the lethality observed. pgant35A Germ Line Clones Arrest during Embryogenesis and Have Tracheal Defects—Recent work by our group has shown that pgant35A has very strong maternal RNA expression in the embryo (30Tian E. Ten Hagen K.G. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To examine when the product of the pgant35A gene is first required during development, we generated pgant35A mutant germ line clones (GLCs) (which contain no wild type maternal pgant35A transcripts in the oocyte). Homozygous mutant pgant35A GLCs were crossed to heterozygotes containing a different pgant35A mutant allele over a wild type chromosome carrying Act5C-GFP. For each allelic combination, most homozygous maternal and zygotic (m/z) pgant35A mutants arrested during embryogenesis (88%); only 12% hatched to larvae (Table 2). Of those larvae, none proceeded to pupation. Some progeny that received a wild type pgant35A allele from their fathers were able to complete embryogenesis (76% for pgant35ASF32 GLC crosses and 45% for pgant35AHG8 GLC crosses), pupate (77% for pgant35ASF32 GLC crosses and 17% for pgant35AHG8 GLC crosses), and continue to adulthood, indicating that zygotic expression of wild type pgant35A during embryogenesis is able to rescue the lethality in a percentage of the cases (Table 2). Therefore, the results from these crosses indicate that pgant35A is required during embryogenesis.TABLE 2Percentage survival of progeny from pgant35A mutant germ line clone crossesGenotypeEmbryos hatching to larvaeLarvae that pupatePupae that eclose%%%w; pgant35AHG8/pgant35A377512 (n = 570)0 (n = 110)NAaNA, not applicable. n = total number of progeny scored for each genotype at each stage.w; pgant35AHG8/+45 (n = 397)17 (n = 176)93 (n = 30)w; pgant35ASF32/pgant35A377512 (n = 405)0 (n = 107)NAw; pgant35ASF32/+76 (n = 269)77 (n = 205)96 (n = 157)a NA, not applicable. n = total number of progeny scored for each genotype at each stage. Open table in a new tab pgant35A homozygous m/z mutant progeny have highly irregular tracheal systems, as seen when staining for the trachea-specific luminal marker, 2A12 (Fig. 2). Most mutants display normal tracheal development until stage 13-15 (Fig. 2, G-I) but acquire obvious tracheal defects by stages 15-17 (Fig. 2, A-F). In particular, the dorsal longitudinal trunk is convoluted and follows a circuitous path (Fig. 2, B, C, E, and F). Additionally, it is highly irregular in diameter, with many regions being much wider or narrower than in wild type embryos. Secondary and tertiary branches show irregularities in branch formation and diameter as well (Fig. 2, B, C, E, and F). Staining with the 2A12 marker is reduced relative to wild type embryos and variable over the length of the tracheal tubes. In general, the severity of the tracheal phenotypes correlated with the severity of the mutant allele (Figs. 1 and 2). Additionally, the percentage of embryos with affected tracheal tubes was also greater in the pgant35AHG8 GLC crosses (86% of pgant35AHG8/3775 embryos affected, n = 98) than in the pgant35ASF32/3775 GLC crosses (72% of pgant35ASF32/3775 embryos affected, n = 83). RNA in situ hybridization showed pgant35A expression in the dorsal longitudinal tracheal trunks and tracheal transverse connectives at stages 15-17 (Fig. 2, J-M). In situ hybridization combined with immunostaining for the luminal 2A12 protein demonstrates that pgant35A expression is confined to the tracheal cells at stage 15 (Fig. 2, L and M). These results, combined with earlier work (30Tian E. Ten Hagen K.G. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), demonstrate that pgant35A is one of only two pgant family members expressed in the embryonic tracheal system; the other family member, pgant2, is expressed earlier during tracheal development, beginning at stage 12 (30Tian E. Ten Hagen K.G. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The time of pgant35A expression (stage 15) corresponds to a period of intense apical secretion in the developing tracheal system and correlates well with the time of onset of the tracheal defects observed in pgant35A m/z mutants. pgant35A Mutants Have Altered Tracheal Cell Morphology—To further investigate the stage at which tracheal defects are first detected, we stained stage 15 embryos for 2A12 and the apical determinant, Crbs. In pgant35A m/z homozygous mutants, decreased levels of 2A12 are seen in the tracheal lumen, with a corresponding increase in 2A12 staining within the cytoplasm of the tracheal cells relative to wild type (Fig. 3, A-A″). Additionally, apical Crbs staining in pgant35A mutants is also slightly reduced, with increased Crbs present in cytoplasmic punctae within the tracheal cells (Fig. 3, B-B″). These results suggest that trafficking of secreted and membrane-bound proteins, such as 2A12 and Crbs, is compromised in pgant35A mutants, with increased amounts of protein being retained in cytoplasmic vesicles. By embryonic stage 17, when tracheal tube diameter expansion is normally occurring, the tracheal tubes of the pgant35A m/z mutants display the irregular diameter and morphology first detected with the 2A12 staining. Stage 17 embryos stained with the cytoskeletal protein, α-spectrin (34Dubreuil R.R. Maddux P.B. Grushko T.A. MacVicar G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), reveal irregular cell shape and size along the length of the tracheal tube; cells no longer display the evenly spaced, regular appearance but are either much larger or smaller than wild type and highly irregular in shape (Fig. 3, C-C″), thus contributing to the irregularities seen in tracheal tube morphology. Additionally, α-spectrin levels are reduced along the apical region of the cells relative to wild type (Fig. 3, C-C″). Alterations in the α-spectrin staining appear more severe in the pgant35AHG8 GLC progeny relative to the pgant35ASF32 GLC progeny, consistent with previous molecular and biochemical characterization of the severity of these mutations (Fig. 1). Further reduction in apical surface staining at stage 17 is seen for Crbs. Apical Crbs is severely diminished in pgant35A mutants across the entire length of the dorsal tracheal trunk in stage 16-17 embryos (Fig. 3, D-D″), suggesting alterations in the polarity of these cells at this stage. Because Crbs is known to regulate adherens junction formation (9Tepass U. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Bachmann A. Schneider M. Thellenberg E. Grawe F. Knust E. Nature. 2001; 414: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we next examined the adherens junction protein, DE-cadherin in pgant35A m/z mutants. DE-cadherin is normally found in an even band around wild type tracheal cells in the subapical region (Fig. 3E). In pgant35A mutants, DE-cadherin is present but does not form a continuous band around the tracheal cells, indicating a discontinuous ZA in the mutant tracheal cells (Fig. 3, E′ and E″). Similar results were obtained with another ZA marker, Armadillo (supplemental data). Taken together, these results show that loss of pgant35A results in reduction of apical and luminal components and subsequent alterations in cell shape and ZA formation at stages 16-17. These changes are likely the result of altered intracellular trafficking observed at stage 15, where mutants had increased cytoplasmic retention of apical and luminal proteins. The tracheal phenotypes seen for the pgant35A mutants are highly reminiscent of the diameter and length irregularities seen in some septate junction mutants and thus prompted us to examine the expression and localization of two septate junction components, Sinuous (19Wu V.M. Schulte J. Hirschi A. Tepass U. Beitel G.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and Discs large (Dlg) (16Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Septate junctions are unique paracellular structures that maintain a permeability barrier in epithelial tubes and represent the functional equivalent of mammalian tight junctions (2Wu V.M. Beitel G.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Tepass U. Tanentzapf G. Ward R. Fehon R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 747-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In wild type embryos, the septate junction proteins are normally localized to the lateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells that comprise the trachea (Fig. 3, F and G). In the pgant35A mutants, however, Sinu and Dlg are mislocalized, being reduced in the lateral regions and increased along the apical surface (Fig. 3, F′-F″ and G′-G″). Again, as expected, the mislocalization of septate junction components appears more severe in the pgant35AHG8 GLC cross than in the pgant35ASF32 GLC cross. These data demonstrate that mutations in pgant35A result in alterations in cell shape and polarity as well as mislocalization of septate junction proteins in the embryonic tracheal system. Diminished O-Glycosylation within the Trachea of pgant35A Mutants—To examine the affects of the pgant35A mutation on the glycan composition in the developing tracheal system, we used a variety of lectins to stain wild type and homozygous pgant35A m/z mutants. The lectins, Jacalin (which detects GlcNAcβ1-3GalNAcα-S/T or Galβ1-3GalNAcα-S/T or sialic acid-Galβ1-3GalNAcα-S/T or"

Because the two activities reside in separate protein domains, polymerases must employ a mechanism that allows for efficient switching of the primer strand between the two active sites to achieve fast and accurate replication. Prior mutational and structural studies suggested that a β hairpin structure located in the exonuclease domain of family B polymerases might play an important role in active site switching in the event of a nucleotide misincorporation. We show that deleting the β hairpin loop in RB69 gp43 affects neither polymerase nor exonuclease activities. Single binding event studies with mismatched primer termini, however, show that the β hairpin plays a role in maintaining the stability of the polymerase/DNA interactions during the binding of the primer DNA in the exonuclease active site but not on the return of the corrected primer to the polymerase active site. In addition, the deletion variant showed a more stable incorporation of a nucleotide opposite an abasic site. Moreover, in the 2.4Å crystal structure of the β hairpin deletion variant incorporating an A opposite a templating furan, all four molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit have DNA in the polymerase active site, despite the presence of DNA distortions because of the misincorporation, confirming that the primer strand is not stably bound within the exonuclease active site in the absence of the β hairpin loop.

Survival of a species necessitates a high degree of accuracy during the replication of its genome. Replicative DNA polymerases therefore possess high levels of discrimination against incorrect nucleotides. When mistakes are made, a rare but potentially problematic situation, many polymerases are equipped with a built-in exonuclease activity, which is capable of removing the mismatched base at the primer terminus. This proofreading activity increases the accuracy of the polymerase up to a hundredfold over that of the polymerase activity alone. One of the most potent exonuclease activities is found in the replicative DNA polymerases from bacteriophages T4 and RB69, which are members of the B family of DNA polymerases. These enzymes can achieve an error frequency of ∼1 mistake for every 108 correct incorporations (1Kunkel T.A. Loeb L.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1539-1545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Drake J.W. Nature. 1969; 221: 1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because the exonuclease domain of these polymerases is located some 30-40 Å away from the polymerase active site, an intriguing question is how the mismatched primer migrates from the polymerase to the exonuclease active site. In DNA polymerases of the A family, the exonuclease domain is located on one side of the palm domain, whereas in the B family polymerases, the proofreading domain is found on the opposite side. Different mechanisms are therefore likely at work in the two families during the primer switching event that takes place during proofreading. Both families of polymerases, however, have been shown to switch active sites processively. For the B family replicative DNA polymerase from bacteriophage T4, switching from the exonuclease to polymerase active sites has been shown to be processive (3Reddy M.K. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14157-14166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for the A family replicative DNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7, the switch between active sites has been shown to be processive in both directions (4Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These polymerases can readily switch DNA between the exonuclease and polymerase active sites without dissociating from the duplex DNA. The A family repair polymerase (pol) 4The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; β-, β hairpin loop deletion; g43, gene 43; gp43, gene product 43; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s., root mean square. 4The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; β-, β hairpin loop deletion; g43, gene 43; gp43, gene product 43; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s., root mean square. I from Escherichia coli can also switch active sites intramolecularly, but the predominant pathway appears to be an intermolecular pathway of dissociation from the mismatched primer terminus with rebinding of the DNA within the exonuclease active site (5Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10858-10866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such an arrangement makes intuitive sense because replicative polymerases have to copy much longer stretches of DNA than repair polymerases; reassembling the replication machinery every time a mispaired nucleotide must be excised is likely be detrimental to the replication of the genome of an organism. A structural basis for the intramolecular pathway has been difficult to elucidate, as it requires a system that allows for visualization of both pre- and post-nucleotide insertion events, as well as editing events. gp43, the DNA polymerase from bacteriophage RB69 (a homolog of T4, as described below), provides a unique opportunity to observe these different conformational states. Several mutations in T4 have been shown to affect the ability of the polymerase to switch the primer strand between active sites (reviewed in Ref. 6Reha-Krantz L.J. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) rather than influence the polymerization or exonuclease reactions. Of these, some are antimutators, such as the A737V substitution within the thumb domain of the enzyme (7Spacciapoli P. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 438-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation is proposed to cause the thumb domain to remain in a more “open” conformation, which would cause the primer to remain within the exonuclease active site for a longer period of time. This results in a polymerase that has more opportunity to degrade primers and is thus more likely to edit mistakes, albeit at the cost of editing correctly base-paired nucleotides. Other switching mutants display a mutator phenotype. Switching from the polymerase to the exonuclease active site is greatly reduced, which decreases the efficiency of the editing reaction. A common mutation pulled out of genetic selection experiments is the mutation encoding the G255S amino acid substitution in T4 (G258S in RB69) (8Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Stocki S.A. Nonay R.L. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This single amino acid substitution leads to a higher phage mutation rate in replicating cells (8Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and biochemical assays show that the exonuclease activity of the polymerase on single-stranded DNA is unaffected by the point mutation, but the rate of degradation of double-stranded DNA is reduced (9Stocki S.A. Nonay R.L. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Marquez L.A. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28903-28911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results suggested a role for this amino acid in the formation of exonuclease complexes. Structural studies of a T4 DNA polymerase fragment showed that the glycine residue at position 255 resides at the tip of a β hairpin loop within the exonuclease domain of the protein (11Wang J. Yu P. Lin T.C. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8110-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but so far there is no structure of full-length T4 DNA polymerase in complex with DNA. The homologous polymerase from bacteriophage RB69, gp43, which shares 61% sequence identity with the T4 polymerase (12Wang C.C. Yeh L.S. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26558-26564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), has been crystallized in an apoform (13Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and with both normal and damaged DNA (14Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 15Hogg M. Wallace S.S. Doublié S.

Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In the ternary complex of the polymerase with a chain terminated primer/template and an incoming dTTP, the fingers domain is closed, and the β hairpin segment is found in an “up” conformation and does not associate with the DNA (Fig. 1A). The 5′ single-stranded template DNA in this structure stacks against Trp-574 at the junction of the palm and fingers domain (17Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Similarly, in a binary complex of the polymerase bound to DNA containing a templating furan (a chemically stable abasic site analog (18Takeshita M. Chang C.N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and a chain terminated primer, the fingers domain is open, and the β hairpin is also in an up conformation (16Freisinger E. Grollman A.P. Miller H. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with no interaction with the single-stranded template DNA. Using an extendable primer, a binary polymerase-DNA complex was captured in which an A was incorporated opposite furan (15Hogg M. Wallace S.S. Doublié S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this structure, four discrete complexes were observed in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. In two of these, the primer/template duplex is located in the polymerase active site, and the duplex has failed to translocate. In these structures, the β hairpin has swung “down,” and the single-stranded template DNA is sandwiched between the β hairpin and Phe-359 of the N-terminal domain of the protein (Fig. 1B). Collectively, the structural studies suggest that the β hairpin loop holds the template strand in place, while the primer strand unwinds from the template and moves toward the exonuclease active site. In an attempt to understand the role of this β hairpin segment in forming exonuclease complexes, we created a β hairpin loop deletion (β-) variant (I253G, Δ254-260) of RB69 gp43. Biochemical assays indicate that neither the polymerase nor exonuclease activities of the enzyme are affected by the deletion variant. Instead, it is the ability of the polymerase to remain associated with the DNA during formation of exonuclease complexes that is reduced in this variant, which in turn leads to a higher tolerance for the generation of errors. A structural analysis of this polymerase variant is consistent with the biochemical data, as it reveals a marked preference for keeping the primer DNA in the polymerase active site after a misincorporation event. Enzymes and Oligonucleotides—Plasmids expressing fulllength and exonuclease-deficient (D222A/D327A) RB69 g43 with a C-terminal His3 tag were obtained from Dr. James Karam (Tulane University). The C-terminal His6-tagged RB69 g43 β-(I253G, Δ254-260) construct was designed as follows. The cDNA for wild type RB69 pol from plasmid pRB.43 (19Bebenek A. Dressman H.K. Carver G.T. Ng S. Petrov V. Yang G. Konigsberg W.H. Karam J.D. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10387-10397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the appropriately restricted pET21 vector (Invitrogen), and DH5α cells were transformed with this plasmid. After isolation of the pET21 vector containing the RB69 g43 insert, the I253G replacement and the Δ254-260 deletion in the g43 insert were carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic oligonucleotide forward and reverse primers were 48 residues long and had 24 residues of the wild type RB69 g43 flanking the site of the deletion, and residue 253 was changed from Ile to Gly. After transforming DH5α cells with the PCR product, plasmid p281 was purified and sequenced. The altered g43 sequence was found to be correct and had no adventitious substitutions in the g43 insert. BL21-DE3 cells were then transformed with this plasmid and the RB69 β-variant expressed after induction of the cells with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The exonuclease-deficient variant (D222A/D327A) of the β-polymerase was made using standard site-directed mutation techniques, and its sequence was checked in its entirety. All enzymes were purified according to a previously published protocol (20Hogg M. Cooper W. Reha-Krantz L. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2528-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were purchased from The Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) and were purified on 16% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea and de-salted on a Sep-Pak cartridge. Duplexes were formed by mixing primer and a 20% excess of template in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl, heating to 90 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooling to room temperature. Primer strands for biochemical assays were labeled at the 5′-end with tetrachlorofluorescein for visualizing product bands. The template sequence was 5′-TTGCGXCTTATGACAGCCGCG-3′, where the X was either a thymine or a furan. The furan residue is the chemically stable abasic site analog used in previous biochemical (20Hogg M. Cooper W. Reha-Krantz L. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2528-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Berdis A.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7180-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and structural (15Hogg M. Wallace S.S. Doublié S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 16Freisinger E. Grollman A.P. Miller H. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) studies. The primer strand sequences were 5′-GCGGCTGTCATAAG-3′ for the properly paired primer/template and 5′-GCGGCTGTCATAAC-3′, 5′-GCGGCTGTCATACC-3′, and 5′-GCGGCTGTCATCCC-3′ for the single, double, and triple mismatches, respectively. As a control experiment, the same primers were annealed to the shorter 18-mer template used for crystallization experiments. The results from the kinetics experiments described below were indistinguishable between the longer 21-mer template used for kinetics experiments and the shorter 18-mer template used for crystallization experiments (data not shown). Polymerase and Exonuclease Assays—All time points from 6 ms to 8 min were taken using an RQF-3 rapid quench apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). For all reactions, syringe A contained 2000 nm enzyme and 500 nm DNA (either duplex DNA or single-stranded primer alone) in a buffer of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Syringe B contained 20 mm magnesium acetate and 250 μm dNTP in an equivalent buffer. For incorporation reactions opposite furan, 2 mm dATP was used as the incoming nucleotide, and for exonuclease assays the dNTPs were omitted. Both halves of the reaction were pushed into the reaction chamber with the same buffer and were quenched by the addition of 500 mm EDTA. Ten microliters of each quenched reaction were mixed with 10 μl of formamide, and product bands were separated from the unreacted primers on 16% polyacrylamide gels with 8 m urea. Gels were scanned on a Bio-Rad molecular imager FX at the Alexa 532 setting to excite the tetrachlorofluorescein fluorophore attached to the 5′-end of the primer DNA. Relative intensities of DNA bands were quantified using Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad), and all data were plotted using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The relative intensities of each band were calculated by dividing the intensity of the band by the total intensities of all bands at a given time point. For nucleotide incorporation assays, the percent incorporation was plotted against time and fit to a single exponential equation (p = A(1-e-kt)) to determine the observed rate constant. For exonuclease assays, the amount of terminal nucleotide remaining, as a percent of the total band intensities, was plotted against time and fit to a single exponential decay (p = Ae-kt). For active site switching experiments, the relative proportion of nucleotide extended was calculated as the ratio of the intensities of all extended bands divided by the total intensities of all bands at the last time point in the experiment (1 s). All reactions were run at 25 °C. Maintaining a saturating amount of enzyme over DNA ensured that small differences in dissociation rates do not affect the reaction rates. Heparin Trap—For single binding events, heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa, Mr 3000; Sigma) was added to the Mg2+/dNTP half of the reaction at 2 mg/ml. Control reactions were run in which heparin was preincubated with the DNA and dNTPs, and the reaction was started by addition of enzyme. No products were observed in these reactions demonstrating the efficacy of the heparin trap (data not shown). For multiple binding events, heparin was omitted. Crystallization—The C-terminal His6-tagged exonuclease-deficient (D222A/D327A), β-variant (I253G, Δ254-260) was used for crystallographic studies. A furan-modified 18-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CGFCTTATGACAGCCGCG) was annealed to a complementary 14-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GCGGCTGTCATAAG). The polymerase (100 μm) was mixed with the annealed primer/template (100 μm) and 2 mm of dATP. Hanging drops were set up by mixing 0.5 μl of reaction mix with 0.5 μl of reservoir solution (9% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, 100 mm sodium acetate, 125 mm magnesium sulfate, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.1), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 14% (v/v) glycerol) and were equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution at 20 °C. After about 10 days, primitive monoclinic (P21) crystals grew to maximum dimensions of 120 × 80 × 80 μm3. Crystals were cryoprotected by increasing the concentration of glycerol and polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether to 17% (v/v) and 10% (w/v), respectively. The crystals were incubated in the cryoprotecting solution for 5 min prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection—X-ray diffraction data to 2.4-Å Bragg spacings were measured at λ = 0.98 Å and at a temperature of 100 K at beamline ID23-D of the Advanced Photon Source, using a MAR m300 CCD detector. The data were processed and scaled using HKL 2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The unit cell parameters (a = 133.07 Å, b = 123.06 Å, c = 164.56 Å, and β = 96.78°) are very similar to those reported for our previously published structure (PDB code 1RV2 (15Hogg M. Wallace S.S.

Based on the structural evidence, we hypothesized that the β hairpin loop was holding the single-stranded template DNA in the polymerase active site, while the incorrectly extended primer strand moved toward the exonuclease active site. If this hypothesis was correct, we would expect the formation of exonuclease complexes to be hindered by the deletion of the β hairpin loop. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized primers ending with one, two, or three mispairs at the 3′-end. In order for extension of the primer to occur, the mispairs must first be removed by the exonuclease activity of the enzyme, followed by switching the primer back into the polymerase active site and subsequent addition of nucleotides to the growing primer. A heparin trap was used to ensure that a single binding event occurs (3Reddy M.K. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14157-14166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the resulting partitioning assay can be used to measure the following: 1) the total amount of DNA processed (excision followed by extension), and 2) the amount of extension relative to the amount of excision. In control experiments with an exonuclease-deficient mutant, we were unable to detect any extended mismatches at the dNTP concentration used (within a limit of detection of about 1 fmol of fluorescently labeled primer) demonstrating that excision of the mismatch must occur before the primer can be measurably extended (data not shown). Therefore, for both sets of measurements, only fully excised mismatches can be considered as extendable substrates. For a single mismatch any excision product of length n - 1 or shorter will result in extendable duplex DNA; for a double mismatch anything n - 2 or shorter is extendable, and for a triple mismatch products n - 3 or shorter are extendable, although in these experiments excision products shorter than n - 3 were not observed. For the first measurement, the total amount of mismatched primer successfully excised and extended during a single binding event, dividing the total intensities of all the extended bands (n + x) plus the completely corrected primers (n - x, as described above) by the sum total of all bands (extended (n + x), excised (n - x), and original primer (n)), shows that there is a 2-3-fold decrease in the amount of excised and extended DNA between the wild type and β-variant polymerases for all three mismatch lengths (Fig. 2A; Table 2, 1st column).

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a sphingolipid released from activated platelets, stimulates COX-2 induction and activates G-protein-coupled receptors coupled to Gα family members. In this study, we investigated whether Gα12 family regulates COX-2 induction by S1P and investigated the molecular basis of this COX-2 regulation. Gene knock-out and chemical inhibitor experiments revealed that the S1P induction of COX-2 requires Gα12 but not Gα13, Gαq, or Gαi/o. The specific role of Gα12 in COX-2 induction by S1P was verified by promoter luciferase assay, Gα12 transfection, and knockdown experiments. Experiments using siRNAs specifically directed against S1P1-5 showed that S1P1, S1P3, and S1P5 are necessary for the full activation of COX-2 induction. Gel shift, immunocytochemistry, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and NF-κB site mutation analyses revealed the role of NF-κBin COX-2 gene transcription by S1P. Gα12 deficiency did not affect S1P-mediated IκBα phosphorylation but abrogated IκBα ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, the inhibition of S1P activation of JNK abolished IκBα ubiquitination. Consistently, JNK transfection restored the ability of S1P to degrade IκBα during Gα12 deficiency. S1P injection induced COX-2 in the lungs and livers of mice and increased plasma prostaglandin E2, and these effects were prevented by Gα12 deficiency. Our data indicate that, of the Gα proteins coupled to S1P receptors, Gα12 specifically regulates NF-κB-mediated COX-2 induction by S1P downstream of S1P1, S1P3, and S1P5, in a process mediated by the JNK-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα.

Experiments using siRNAs specifically directed against S1P1-5 showed that S1P1, S1P3, and S1P5 are necessary for the full activation of COX-2 induction. Gel shift, immunocytochemistry, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and NF-κB site mutation analyses revealed the role of NF-κBin COX-2 gene transcription by S1P. Gα12 deficiency did not affect S1P-mediated IκBα phosphorylation but abrogated IκBα ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, the inhibition of S1P activation of JNK abolished IκBα ubiquitination. Consistently, JNK transfection restored the ability of S1P to degrade IκBα during Gα12 deficiency. S1P injection induced COX-2 in the lungs and livers of mice and increased plasma prostaglandin E2, and these effects were prevented by Gα12 deficiency. Our data indicate that, of the Gα proteins coupled to S1P receptors, Gα12 specifically regulates NF-κB-mediated COX-2 induction by S1P downstream of S1P1, S1P3, and S1P5, in a process mediated by the JNK-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα.

Aso R. Int. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Res. 2001; 21: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PGs are produced by members of the cyclooxygenase (COX) family, and whereas COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most mammalian tissues, COX-2 induction is restricted to some pathological lesions (e.g. atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and cancerous tissues) (2Schonbeck U. Sukhova G.K. Graber P. Coulter S. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Transcription of the COX-2 gene is promoted by transcription factors encoded by immediate early genes and can be up-regulated by various proinflammatory agents, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, cytokines, and mitogens. Moreover, PGs produced by inducible COX-2 participate in the vasodilatation associated with thrombosis and amplify inflammatory responses (3Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown the involvement of lipid factors in diverse cellular responses. In particular, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid mediator that exerts a wide range of physiological activities (4Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25851-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). S1P enhances vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and thus serves as a factor that stimulates coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, and an abnormal vascular tone during aging (5Deutschman D.H. Carstens J.S. Klepper R.L. Smith W.S. Page M.T. Young T.R. Gleason L.A. Nakajima N. Sabbadini R.A. Am. Heart J. 2003; 146: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Boguslawski G. Grogg J.R.

The most well known actions of S1P are mediated by its binding to a family of S1P G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (7Rosen H. Goetzl E.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Moreover, S1P receptors couple to a variety of G-proteins and thus regulate cell migration, angiogenesis, vascular maturation, cardiac development, neuronal survival, and immunity (4Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25851-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 8Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated sphingolipids in the regulation of the COX-2 gene and in those of other target genes, whose products mediate vascular inflammatory responses (9Pettus B.J. Bielawski J. Porcelli A.M. Reames D.L. Johnson K.R. Morrow J. Chalfant C.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the functions of sphingolipids in the regulation of the COX-2 gene and their relations with the promotion of inflammatory processes are not completely understood. However, the observation that the down-regulation of sphingosine kinase-1 prevents cytokines from inducing COX-2 suggests that an S1P-mediated cell signaling pathway is required for COX-2 induction (9Pettus B.J. Bielawski J. Porcelli A.M. Reames D.L. Johnson K.R. Morrow J. Chalfant C.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 10Davaille J. Gallois C.

G-proteins interact with GPCRs, and then activated G-proteins transmit signals to regulate physiological responses. Heterotrimeric G-proteins are defined by their α subunits, which are classified as Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq, and Gα12. Of the G-protein families, Gα12 members are activated by sphingolipids, TXA2, or lysophosphatidic acid (11Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B.

Gα12 and Gα13 appear to differ in terms of their abilities to couple to different ligands and to recruit different signaling pathways as physiological effectors (11Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S.

Gene knock-out experiments revealed that Gα13 knock-out (Gα13-/-) mice have impaired angiogenesis and intrauterine death, whereas Gα12-deficient mice survived (12Gu J.L. Muller S. Mancino V. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9352-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the regulatory roles of Gα12 on COX-2 gene induction by S1P, a sphingolipid released from activated platelets. We examined whether COX-2 induction by S1P occurs via pathways involving Gα12, Gα13, Gαq, or Gαi/o. Based on our previous finding that Gα12 members regulate NF-κB activation by thrombin (13Kang K.W. Choi S.Y. Cho M.K. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17368-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we further examined whether NF-κB regulation is linked with G-protein-mediated signaling for COX-2 induction by S1P. We also explored the molecular basis of Gα12 function in the S1P-induced IκBα degradation necessary for NF-κB activation, with particular reference to its JNK-dependent IκBα ubiquitination. In addition, we verified the physiological role of Gα12 on COX-2 induction by S1P in an animal model.

The MEF cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106/dish (10-cm diameter) and preincubated for 24 h at 37 °C. For all experiments, cells were grown to 80-90% confluence. The cells were scraped, transferred to microtubes, and allowed to swell by adding lysis buffer. Nuclear extracts and total lysates were prepared, as described previously (13Kang K.W. Choi S.Y.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4150-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PCR Analysis—S1P receptor and COX-2 transcripts were analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription or real time PCR. RNA was isolated from cells by using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT)16 primers to obtain cDNA. The cDNA was amplified by PCR. The sequences of the primers used were as follows: S1P1 receptor (197 bp), 5′-GATGCGCCGGGCCTTCAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGAAGAAGAACTGACGTTTCCA-3′ (antisense); S1P2 receptor (205 bp), 5′-ACGTGGCGTAGCCGGGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATTTTCCCTTCAGACCACTG-3′ (antisense); S1P3 receptor (209 bp), 5′-TCTTCCGGTTGGTGTGCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTGCAGAGGACCCCGTTCT-3′ (antisense); S1P4 receptor (321 bp), 5′-GCTGCCCCTCTACTCCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATTAATGGCTGAGTTGAACAC-3′ (antisense); S1P5 receptor (167 bp), 5′-CCAACAGCTTGCAGCGATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTTGCTACTCCAGGACTG-3′ (antisense); COX-2 (624 bp), 5′-TCTCCAACCTCTCCTACTAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCACGTAGTCTTCGATCACT-3′ (antisense). Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analyses were performed according to the previously published procedures (13Kang K.W. Choi S.Y. Cho M.K. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17368-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Ki S.H. Cho I.J. Choi D.W. Kim S.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4150-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Proteins of interest in lysates or nuclear fractions were resolved using a 7.5% gel and developed using an ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Shift Assay—Double-stranded DNA probes for the consensus sequences of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) (5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′), cAMP-response element/E-box (CREB) (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′), and NF-κB(5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) were used for gel shift analyses after end labeling of each probe with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts were prepared by modification of the procedure published previously (13Kang K.W. Choi S.Y. Cho M.K. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4150-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry of p65—Cells were grown on Lab-TEK chamber slides® (Nalge Nunc International Corp.) and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. A standard immunocytochemical method was used as described previously (17Ki S.H. Cho I.J. Choi D.W. Kim S.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4150-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Counterstaining with propidium iodide verified the location and integrity of nuclei. Stained cells were examined using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS NT, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Transient Transfection—Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well dish and transfected the following day. Briefly, the cells were incubated with a minigene construct expressing C-terminal peptide of Gα12 or Gα13 that serves as a blocker of the specific site of the GPCR (Gα12 or Gα13 minigene) and 3 μl of Lipofectamine® reagent (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of antibiotics-free minimal essential medium for 3 h. Culture medium was changed with serum-free minimal essential medium with antibiotics, and the cells were further incubated for 24 h. In some experiments, cells were transfected with the wild type Gα12 plasmid. Knockdown Experiment Using siRNA—Cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA directed against Gα12 (100 pmol) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. COX-2 was immunoblotted in the lysates of cells incubated with S1P for 3 h. The target sequences of a commercially available Gα12 siRNA mixture were 5′-CCAGUAAGCAAGACAUCCU-3′, 5′-GCAUCACAUCUAUCCUGUU-3′, and 5′-CUCUGCUGUUGAUCUGUAA-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation—To assess ubiquitinated IκBα, cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding His-tagged ubiquitin. Cell lysates (250 μg/ml) were incubated with anti-His antibody overnight at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complex was immunoprecipitated after incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-agarose. Immune complexes were solubilized in 2× Laemmli buffer. Protein samples were resolved and immunoblotted with anti-IκBα antibody. COX-2 Promoter-Luciferase Assay—Genomic DNA was isolated from ICR mouse tail. To generate pGL-mCOX2-724, a COX-2 promoter-luciferase construct, the COX-2 promoter region from -724 to + 7 bp was amplified and then ligated into KpnI/XhoI sites of pGL3-basic plasmid (Promega). Mutation constructs to the NF-κB and E-box sites of COX-2 promoter were produced by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were 5′-GGGGAGAGGTGAGGGccTTCCCTTAGTTAGGACC-3′ and 5′-GTCACCACTACGTCACGcaGAGTCCGCTTTACAGAC-3′, respectively (lowercase letters indicate mutant nucleotides) (3Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 18Vila-del Sol V. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2825-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (ABI7700). The COX-2 luciferase (or mutant) construct and pCMV-LacZ were co-transfected to RK-/- and/or Gα12-/- cells and then incubated with 1 μm S1P for 3 h. To determine the COX-2 promoter activity, we used the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The activity of β-galactosidase was measured to normalize transfection efficiency using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate at 420 nm. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells were treated with S1P for 1 h, and then formaldehyde was added to the cells to a final concentration of 1% for cross-linking of chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were conducted as described previously (17Ki S.H. Cho I.J. Choi D.W. Kim S.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4150-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PCR was performed with the specific primers flanking the NF-κB region of the COX-2 gene (sense, 5′-ATGTGGACCCTGACAGAGGA-3′; antisense, 5′-TCTCCGGTTTCCTCCCAGTC-3′, 222 bp). Knock-out Animals—Gα12 knock-out mice generated as described previously (11Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) were supplied by Dr. M. Simon. After they were anesthetized with ketamine, wild type (WT) or Gα12 knock-out mice were infused with S1P for 30 min via the femoral vein or intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (1 mg/kg). Animals were sacrificed 3 h after treatment. COX-2 was immunoblotted in the lung or liver homogenates. Prostaglandin E2 contents in plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance procedures were used to assess significant differences among treatment groups. For each significant effect of treatment, the Newman-Keuls test was used for comparisons of multiple group means. The criterion for statistical significance was set at p < 0.01. COX-2 Gene Repression by Gα12 Deficiency—S1P treatment at 0.3 or 1 μm notably induced COX-2 in RK-/- MEF cells. In this study, RK-/- cells were used as a knock-out control, because the physiological function of rhodopsin kinase is restricted to phototransduction (19Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Palczewski K. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2003; 22: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and is not relevant to the function of endogenous G-protein in MEFs. S1P at 0.1 μm, which is equivalent to the plasma concentration observed in healthy control animals (20Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo. 1997; 121: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), weakly enhanced COX-2 expression (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that S1P at submicromolar concentrations has a threshold effect on COX-2 induction. Considering the micromolar range of S1P observed in plasma (i.e. 1-5 μm) (20Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo. 1997; 121: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) after platelet activation, the concentrations of S1P used in this study appropriately represent pathophysiological situations. We confirmed that the ability of S1P to induce COX-2 in RK-/- cells was the same as that in wild type MEF cells (Fig. 1B). In subsequent experiments, we determined whether deficiencies of specific Gα proteins affected the induction of COX-2 by S1P. Whereas COX-2 expression increased in RK-/-, Gα13-/-, or Gαq-/- cells 1-12 h after S1P treatment, Gα12 deficiency completely blocked the ability of S1P to induce COX-2 (Fig. 1, C and D). Moreover, COX-2 was minimally expressed in untreated Gα12-/- or Gα12/13-/- cells compared with control or Gαq-/- cells, which suggests that the constitutive expression of COX-2 requires Gα12 (Fig. 1D). Activated S1P1-5 couple with Gαi proteins and thus inhibit S1P action (21Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). To exclude the involvement of Gαi/o in the induction of COX-2 by S1P, COX-2 was immunochemically monitored in cells incubated with 1 μm S1P after pretreatment with 0.1 ng/ml PTX, an inhibitor of Gαi/o proteins. Our results demonstrated that PTX treatment failed to alter the ability of S1P to induce COX-2 (Fig. 1E), which indicates that COX-2 induction by S1P is unaffected by the Gαi/o pathway. A previous study showed that S1P promotes ERK1/2 phosphorylation via a Gαi/o-dependent pathway (22Sato K. Tomura H. Igarashi Y. Ui M. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Data showing that PTX inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation by S1P confirmed the effectiveness of PTX. We next determined whether the lack of COX-2 induction by S1P in Gα12-/- cells is the result of the down-regulation of COX-2 gene transcription. Reporter gene assays revealed that the luciferase activity of pGL-mCOX-2-724, containing the promoter region of the human COX-2 gene, was significantly increased by S1P (1 μm, 3 h) in RK-/- cells (Fig. 1F). Moreover, Gα12 deficiency completely inhibited the ability of S1P to induce luciferase expression. On the other hand, a lack of Gα13 did not change COX-2 gene induction. Real time PCR analysis revealed that S1P treatment enhanced the level of endogenous COX-2 mRNA in RK-/- cells but not in Gα12-/- cells (Fig. 1G). In Gα13-/- cells, S1P also increased COX-2 mRNA levels. Our data indicate that Gα12, but not Gα13, plays a critical role in COX-2 induction by S1P, which results from the transcriptional activation of the COX-2 gene. Given the specific role of Gα12 in the induction of COX-2, we focused subsequently on the role of Gα12 in the gene regulation. Transfection and siRNA Knockdown Experiments—To confirm the regulatory role of Gα12 on COX-2 induction by S1P, we examined the effect of wild-type Gα12 (Gα12W) overexpression in Gα12-/- cells. Gα12W transfection enabled these cells to respond to S1P with respect to COX-2 induction (Fig. 2A). To further verify the role of Gα12 on S1P-mediated COX-2 induction, we measured COX-2 expression levels under knockdown conditions. Fig. 2B shows that Gα12 knockdown by siRNA decreased S1P-dependent COX-2 induction; this knockdown of Gα12 was confirmed by immunoblotting. These data confirm that Gα12 indeed mediates the induction of COX-2 by S1P. Consistently, the induction of COX-2 by S1P was completely abrogated by transfection with the minigene vector of Gα12 but not by that of Gα13 (C-terminal peptide of Gα12 or Gα13 blocks GPCR) in control cells (Fig. 2C, top). Gα12 or Gα13 minigene transfection inhibited S1P- or thrombin-inducible ERK phosphorylation, as was previously observed (23Gilchrist A. Vanhauwe J.F. Li A. Thomas T.O. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25672-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which validated our assay conditions (Fig. 2C, bottom). This finding suggests the involvement of Gα12 coupling to GPCR during the induction of COX-2 by S1P. Identification of S1P Receptors for COX-2 Induction—To determine whether S1P receptors are required for COX-2 induction and to identify the responsible S1P receptor isoforms, we performed an experiment with siRNAs specifically directed against S1P1-5. First, the presence of S1P receptor sub-types in MEF cells was examined by RT-PCR of S1P1-5 gene products (Fig. 3A). The intensities of bands were comparable with each other in the MEF cells, indicating that the transcripts for S1P receptors are comparable except for specific Gα-protein knockouts. Subsequently, transfection with siRNAs directed against S1P1, S1P3, or S1P5 notably suppressed S1P-mediated COX-2 induction, whereas transfection with siRNAs against S1P2 or S1P4 failed to do so (Fig. 3B, top). RT-PCR control experiments confirmed specific knockdown of S1P receptors by siRNAs (Fig. 3B, bottom). Our results suggest that S1P requires S1P1, S1P3, and S1P5 for full activation of COX-2 induction. Role of NF-κB Activation in Gα12-mediated COX-2 Induction—NF-κB, C/EBP, and CREB proteins are critical transcription factors and interact with the upstream region of the COX-2 gene (24Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). To determine whether COX-2 induction by S1P was accompanied by the activations of transcription factors, we first performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Treatment of control cells with S1P (1 μm, 30 min to 3 h) resulted in increases in the band intensities of NF-κB DNA binding (Fig. 4A). Immunocompetition assays using anti-p65 antibody confirmed the specificity of NF-κB DNA binding (data not shown). In contrast, the bindings of C/EBP and of CREB to their respective consensus oligonucleotides were not increased by S1P treatment. Moreover, a deficiency of Gα12 completely abolished the formation of NF-κB DNA complex, indicating that Gα12 regulates NF-κB activation in response to S1P. Next, to explore the functional role of NF-κB activation by S1P in COX-2 gene induction, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Genomic DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 (a major component of NF-κB) antibody, and this was followed by the reversal of cross-linking and PCR amplification using primers flanking the proximal and distal regions of the DNA corresponding to the NF-κB binding site in the COX-2 gene promoter. In control cells treated with S1P, PCR product intensity was significantly higher than in untreated cells, and increases in the band intensity of NF-κB DNA complex were prevented by the absence of Gα12 (Fig. 4B). We next tested whether mutation of the NF-κB binding site present in the promoter region of the COX-2 gene suppressed NF-κB-mediated gene transcription by S1P. Consistent with the above results, mutation of the NF-κB binding site abolished an increase in COX-2 reporter activity by S1P (Fig. 4C). A previous study showed that mutation of the E-box in the promoter region of COX-2 did not change lipopolysaccharide-induced reporter activity (3Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, COX-2 induction by S1P was unaffected by specific mutation of the E-box consensus sequence, which supports the specific role of NF-κB. These data indicate that NF-κB activation by S1P depends on Gα12 and contributes to COX-2 gene induction. Nuclear Translocation of p65—Activated NF-κB, which consists of p65 and p50, translocates into the nucleus after being relieved from its IκBα binding. Immunocytochemistry showed that p65 was located mainly in the cytoplasm of MEF cells (Fig. 5A). S1P treatment (1 μm, 1 h) allowed p65 to translocate into the nucleus in control cells. On the contrary, the nuclear translocation of p65 was blocked by the absence of Gα12.Aswas expected, the absence of Gα13 did not inhibit p65 nuclear localization, confirming the specific role of Gα12 in NF-κB activation. The nuclear integrity was confirmed by propidium iodide staining of the MEF cells. In addition, immunoblot analyses were performed to compare the nuclear levels of p65 as a function of time. S1P treatment (30 min to 3 h) increased p65 levels in the nuclear fractions of control or Gα13-/- cells but not in those of Gα12-/- cells (Fig. 5B), thus verifying that the lack of Gα12 inhibits NF-κB nuclear translocation. IκBα Degradation by Gα12—Activation of NF-κB is initiated by extracellular stimuli that lead to the activation of IKK complex, which phosphorylates IκBα proteins. To address whether NF-κB-mediated COX-2 induction by S1P involves IκBα phosphorylation, COX-2 expression was monitored in RK-/- cells incubated with Bay117082 (a specific IKK inhibitor) prior to S1P treatment (25Pahl H.L.

Enteric bacteria mount stress responses that allow them to survive in acidic conditions as they pass through the stomach (pH 2–4) on their way to the intestine (1Castanie-Cornet M.P. Penfound T.A.

Escherichia coli resists strong acid challenges by activating multicomponent systems that pump protons out of the cytoplasm as rapidly as they leak in, thereby maintaining a steady-state intracellular pH of ∼5.0 (3Richard H. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6032-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Two well studied acid resistance systems use proton extrusion pumps powered by amino acid decarboxylation: one for glutamate and the other for arginine. This report concerns the arginine system, outlined in Fig. 1. Arg enters the cell through a membrane transporter and is then decarboxylated by an acid-activated arginine decarboxylase. This reaction consumes a proton, which ends up on the 1-position of the product 1-amino-4-guanidino-n-butane, commonly denoted agmatine (Agm). 2The abbreviations used are: Agm, agmatine; MFS, major facilitator superfamily; DM, decylmaltoside; EB, external buffer; WB, wash buffer; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Agm leaves the cell, carrying this “virtual proton” with it, through the same membrane transporter that brings Arg in with a one-to-one exchange stoichiometry (4Iyer R. Iverson T.M. Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2002; 419: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This transport protein (accession number P60061), recently identified and named AdiC (5Gong S. Richard H. Foster J.W.

This report describes the overexpression, purification, and quaternary structure of AdiC, along with an initial description of its membrane transport behavior. The protein forms a stable homodimer in detergent micelles and phospholipid membranes. Exchange transport of Arg and Agm is tightly coupled, electrogenic, and acid-activated. The unusually high expression level of this membrane protein makes it an attractive system for detailed structure-function analysis. Expression, Purification, and Reconstitution—The coding sequence of the adiC gene of E. coli was inserted into the XbaI/HindIII cassette of vector pASK-IBA2 (11Skerra A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) behind a ribosome-binding sequence (TAACGAGGGCAAAAA), as described for a Cl– transporter (12Accardi A. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Williams C. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A hexahistidine tag followed by a thrombin recognition sequence and linker (HHHHHHSGGLVPRGSGT) was interposed between the initiator methionine and the natural AdiC sequence. Transformed BL21(DE3) cells were grown in Terrific Broth at 37 °C to A600 of 1.5 and induced with 0.2 mg/liter anhydrotetracycline for 3 h. Cell pellets, suspended in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, were sonicated on ice with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin/pepstatin; 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), and membrane protein was extracted in 40 mm decylmaltoside (DM) at room temperature for 2 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 40 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a Talon cobalt affinity column (2-ml bed volume for a 1-liter culture). The column was washed with 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm DM (wash buffer, WB) and then with 20 mm imidazole in WB until the peak of nonspecifically bound protein had passed (∼15 ml); AdiC was eluted by 400 mm imidazole in WB. After concentrating to 0.5–1 ml, the sample was treated with thrombin (Roche Applied Science, 0.1 units/mg of AdiC) at 4 °C overnight, and AdiC was purified on a Superdex 200 size exclusion column in WB with 5 mm DM. This column was calibrated (13Maduke M. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) with the elution times in DM solutions of functionally active integral membrane protein complexes of known molecular sizes (and roughly similar non-pathological shapes) as follows: MthK, 250 kDa (14Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), 10.5 ml; CLC-ec1-FAB complex (15Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), 200 kDa, 11.1 ml; MloK1 (16Nimigean C.M. Shane T. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), 150 kDa, 11.3 ml; CLC-ec1, 100 kDa, 12.5 ml; KcsA (17Heginbotham L. Odessey E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), 74 kDa, 13.3 ml. Bound detergent and lipid make these membrane proteins elute systematically ahead of soluble-protein standards of similar molecular size: catalase, 232 kDa, 12.3 min; FAB 100 kDa, 15.9 min bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa, 13.8 min. The AdiC peak was collected into an Amicon concentrator with 50-kDa cutoff and concentrated to 5–10 mg/ml. Molar extinction coefficient was estimated from the AdiC sequence as 86,000 m–1 cm–1 (A280 of unity equivalent to 11.6 μm, 0.54 mg/ml), a value confirmed by substrate binding stoichiometry via isothermal titration calorimetry. Arg-transporting proteoliposomes were formed from a micellar solution consisting of 34 mm Chaps in WB, 20 mg/ml phospholipid (E. coli polar lipid, Avanti), and AdiC (typically 1–5 μg/mg of lipid); detergent was removed by extensive dialysis against external buffer (EB, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.0). For experiments in which pH was varied, 25 mm citrate/25 mm phosphate was substituted for Mes. Proteoliposomes were stored frozen in aliquots at –80 °C. For most experiments, liposomes were formed 1–2 days after purification, although AdiC could be stored in detergent at 4 °C for a month without loss of transport activity upon subsequent reconstitution or of monodispersity in gel filtration. 14C[Arginine] Uptake—Antiport activity was followed via uptake of l-[14C]arginine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) into AdiC-containing liposomes preloaded with a saturating concentration of non-radioactive substrate (in most cases 5 mm Agm or Arg). The liposomes were loaded by 2–3 rounds of freeze-thaw sonication in the presence of substrate, and after the final thawing step, they were then extruded 21 times through a membrane filter (400 nm, Avestin). Just before the uptake assay, the extraliposomal substrate was removed by centrifuging the liposomes through Sephadex G-50 spin columns equilibrated with EB and dried by prespinning (a 100-μl sample for each 1.5-ml column). Uptake was initiated by adding l-Arg spiked with [14C]Arg (typically 50 μm, 1 μCi/ml). At each time point, [14C]Arg trapped inside the liposomes was measured by applying a 50-μl sample to a 2-ml G-50 column equilibrated with substrate-free EB, a maneuver that quickly stops the uptake (∼10 s), and eluting the liposomes with 1.2 ml of EB for liquid scintillation counting. Unless otherwise noted, transport assays were carried out in EB. Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking—For cross-linking in detergent solution, glutaraldehyde (50–100 mm) was added to AdiC (1–3 mg/ml in WB containing either 10 mm DM or 0.5% SDS, for cross-linking in native or denaturing conditions, respectively). After an hour at room temperature, SDS gel-loading buffer was added, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with 10% β-mercaptoethanol. For cross-linking in membranes, liposomes containing AdiC (20 or 0.1 μg of protein/mg of lipid) were formed from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol, 1:1 or 3:1 w/w, 10 mg/ml. This composition avoids lipid amino groups, which would confound the cross-linking reaction. Cross-linking was carried out as above. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—All solutions were thoroughly degassed before titration in an ITC instrument (MicroCal). A solution of AdiC (0.15 mm in 1.8-ml WB) was loaded into the sample cell, 6 mm titrant (Arg or Agm in WB) was loaded into the injection syringe, and the system was equilibrated at 25 °C. A titration curve was generated by 25 successive 20-μl injections at 200-s intervals. Control injections were done in the absence of protein to determine background corrections. The data were fit to single-site binding isotherms with Origin software. Purification and Homodimeric Architecture—A construct of AdiC bearing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was expressed in E. coli, solubilized in detergent (DM), and purified by a conventional three-step procedure involving Co-affinity chromatography, thrombin cleavage of the His tag, and final cleanup by gel filtration. The procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2A, which shows the completeness of His tag removal and high purity of the final preparation of AdiC, a single band on SDS-PAGE gels running somewhat faster than the position expected from its polypeptide sequence (46.8 kDa), as has been seen with other membrane proteins. In gel filtration on a calibrated Superdex 200 column, micellar AdiC runs as a symmetrical, monodisperse peak (Fig. 2B), but it co-elutes (12.4 ml) with the 100-kDa standard CLC-ec1, well ahead of the position expected (∼14 ml) from its monomer molecular size and also ahead of the 74-kDa standard KcsA (13.3 ml). Thus, AdiC appears to behave as a 94-kDa homodimer in detergent solution. However, this inference is shaky since membrane proteins typically bind detergent and lipids, unknown extra mass that affects the gel filtration profile. This ambiguity is mitigated empirically by the use of membrane proteins for calibration, but it is not eliminated since it is still possible that AdiC may bind much more detergent than do the standards. In light of these uncertainties, which apply to all hydrodynamic size determination methods for membrane proteins, we turned to an alternative, independent approach to scrutinize the oligomeric state of the protein: glutaraldehyde cross-linking. Directed at surface-exposed amino groups, glutaraldehyde has been used to analyze the quaternary structure of purified multisubunit membrane proteins (13Maduke M. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18Roth G.J. Siok C.J. Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1301-1304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lai F.A.

This method also has potential pitfalls, especially when used with protein mixtures, but it produces clean results for purified AdiC in detergent solution (Fig. 3A). Treatment of the protein results in a shift of the monomer band (∼30-kDa position on a denaturing SDS gel) to a position (∼70 kDa) expected for the homodimer. The shift is quantitative: complete conversion of monomer to dimer with no indication of the higher bands that would arise by cross-linking between separately dispersed proteins. Moreover, cross-linker treatment in a denaturing detergent, SDS, fails to shift the monomer band, a result that further argues against such intermolecular cross-linking. The glutaraldehyde-treated samples, whether cross-linked or not, run as fuzzy bands, as expected from the adduct heterogeneity produced by this reaction. Does AdiC form a homodimer in membranes? To address this biologically pertinent question, we cross-linked functionally reconstituted AdiC, taking advantage of liposomes as nano-vessels in which individual transporters can be held in isolation from each other. If AdiC is reconstituted at high protein density, 20 μg/ml, where many transporters inhabit each liposome, a menagerie of high oligomers is seen with much of the protein unable to enter even the stacking gel (data not shown), as expected from intermolecular cross-linking of proteins sharing the same liposome. However, a completely different gel pattern is seen if AdiC is reconstituted at 200-fold lower density, where the number of protein molecules in the sample is much less than the number of liposomes. In this situation, most of the liposomes are devoid of protein, and those containing AdiC carry only a single transporting unit (13Maduke M. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Heginbotham L. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In these “lonesome transporter” conditions, glutaraldehyde quantitatively shifts the monomer band to the dimer position without the appearance of any higher bands (Fig. 3B). These results are starkly incompatible with AdiC being monomeric and thus establish the membrane-embedded protein as a homodimer. This conclusion is notable as most well studied MFS transporters function as monomers, but it is not unprecedented since a few cases of multimeric MFS proteins have been described (23Hickman R.K. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1715-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Geertsma E.R. Duurkens R.H. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Arginine Transport—Purified AdiC was reconstituted into lipid vesicles preloaded with the physiological exchange partner, Agm, at a high concentration, 5 mm. The addition of 50 μm [14C]Arg to the external solution evokes robust uptake observable within a few seconds and approaching a steady level in 10 min (Fig. 4). The large outwardly directed Agm gradient drives Arg into the liposomes; the magnitude of active accumulation can be appreciated by noting that at maximal uptake, ∼30% of the Arg in the system ends up inside the liposomes, which take up only ∼2% of the volume. A rough calculation indicates that at maximal uptake, internal Arg is concentrated to ∼1.5 mm, external Arg is depleted to ∼35 μm, and internal Agm falls to ∼3.5 mm. Somewhat faster uptake is seen under [14C]Arg-Arg exchange conditions. No Arg uptake occurs in liposomes in which transport substrate is absent or in liposomes loaded with d-Arg. Arg-Agm exchange increases with the concentration of AdiC in the liposomes (Fig. 5A). At limiting low density, ∼0.1 μg/mg of lipid, where most of the liposomes are protein-free and those liposomes that do contain transporters carry only a single copy, uptake is low but readily discernable. As AdiC density increases, so does uptake, which tends toward saturation in both rate and final extent above ∼3 μg/mg. For the initial rate, this probably reflects the limited time resolution of our transport assay (∼10 s), whereas saturation of final uptake is expected if all liposomes are reconstituted with protein at these high densities. As a component of an E. coli acid resistance response, AdiC operates below pH 5, and this biological imperative shows itself in the pH dependence of transport (Fig. 5B). The protein supports respectable antiport around neutral pH, but the uptake rate is much greater at pH 4. (Liposome leakiness precludes measurements below pH 4.) Electrogenicity of Arg-Agm Exchange—E. coli uses AdiC to bring Arg into the cell as Agm is simultaneously excreted. This function demands a one-for-one transport stoichiometry, as has been confirmed in whole-cell studies (4Iyer R. Iverson T.M. Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2002; 419: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In our standard assay conditions at pH 6, Arg and Agm differ in charge (+1 and +2, respectively), and so the reaction is expected to be electrogenic, generating outward positive current and thus inside negative voltage. The resulting electrical imbalance would hinder the uptake reaction unless charge buildup were relieved. However, under the conditions of Fig. 4, with symmetrical KCl, the K+ ionophore valinomycin, which would dissipate any such inhibitory membrane potential, fails to enhance Arg-Agm exchange (data not shown). This negative result has two possible explanations. Either the transporter is unexpectedly electroneutral, or the K+ and Cl– ions in the system, despite their low membrane permeabilities, manage to electrically compensate by virtue of their vast excess over the transported substrates. We tested these alternatives by imposing large membrane potentials, either positive or negative, using K+ gradients in the presence of valinomycin and substituting a large impermeant anion, glutamate (13Maduke M. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Goldberg A.F.X. Miller C. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 124: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), for Cl–. Arg-Agm exchange was examined in liposomes loaded with Tris-glutamate and immersed in K-glutamate (high voltage, positive inside) and in liposomes with these ionic conditions reversed (high negative voltage). In the absence of valinomycin, both conditions show Arg uptake (Fig. 6), with liposomes formed in Tris-glutamate somewhat more active than those formed in K-glutamate, for unknown reasons. Valinomycin now alters transport dramatically, exactly as expected for electrogenic exchange. Initial rates are accelerated by positive voltage at least 10-fold (beyond the time resolution of the assay) and inhibited at least 10-fold by negative voltage. Steady-state uptake levels respond similarly, although not by the same factors as the initial rates. Control experiments (not shown) confirm that valinomycin has negligible effect on [14C]Arg-Arg self-exchange, which is necessarily electroneutral. These results demonstrate that AdiC-mediated Arg-Agm exchange is electrogenic. As a supplementary point, we note that if Cl– is used as the anion in similar K+ gradient experiments (not shown), the valinomycin effect on transport is less impressive than with glutamate; this result suggests that the background permeability of Cl– in our system accounts for the aforementioned failure of valinomycin to stimulate transport in symmetrical KCl solutions. Transport Kinetics and Substrate Specificity—To gain a preliminary kinetic overview of AdiC, we measured the initial steady-state rate of [14C]Arg-Arg exchange as a function of external Arg concentration, with saturating Arg inside the liposomes (Fig. 7A). The rate follows a Michaelis-Menten relation (Fig. 7B), with Km of 80 μm, in unreasonably good agreement with the half-saturation concentration (83 μm) for Arg uptake into whole E. coli cells acid-shocked at pH 2.5 (6Iyer R. Williams C. Miller C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6556-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); when these rates are normalized to the amount of protein in the assay, Vmax is on the order of 1 s–1, a surprisingly low value, even at the submaximal pH used in these experiments. A few substrate analogues were qualitatively assessed for transport competence (Fig. 7C). After accumulation of [14C]Arg to a steady level, test compounds were added to the external solution at a high concentration (5 mm); the ensuing Arg efflux reflects coupled influx of the test compound. l-Arg, the natural substrate, stimulates almost complete efflux by the first time point; in contrast, d-Arg shows no transport whatever, as expected from its inability to support l-Arg/d-Arg exchange in the direct uptake assay (Fig. 4). Lysine and ornithine show intermediate behavior, and 1,5-diaminopentane, an Agm analogue in which an amino group substitutes for the guanidinium, is transported well. This small survey serves as a guide for future detailed studies on transport specificity. It is an enzymological truism that the Michaelis-Menten constant of a substrate does not represent equilibrium binding, and this dictum is all the more applicable in a membrane transport protein, where the reaction involves multiple conformations and substrates are distinguished vectorially. However, the equilibrium binding parameters for substrates, analogues, and inhibitors are nevertheless desirable as these can give information on energetic determinants of substrate recognition. We therefore used ITC of AdiC in detergent solution to investigate binding of its two natural substrates. For both Arg and Agm, substrate titrations produce easily measured signals of heat absorption, showing that binding is enthalpically unfavorable, and thus entropy-driven, with Arg showing substantially larger binding enthalpy than Agm. The titration data are fit well by isotherms saturating at one binding site per AdiC monomer (Fig. 8), with equilibrium dissociation constants of ∼100 μm for Arg and ∼30 μm for Agm. Full thermodynamic parameters are reported in Table 1.TABLE 1Equilibrium binding parameters derived from isothermal titration calorimetrySubstrateKDNumber of binding sites per AdiC monomerΔHoΔSoμmnkcal/molcal/mol-KArginine93 μm1.034.634Agmatine29 μm1.030.422 Open table in a new tab The Arg-Agm exchanger AdiC, a key component in a strong acid resistance pathway of E. coli, belongs to the enormous MFS superfamily of coupled transporters. MFS proteins labor at an impressively diverse range of biological tasks in prokaryotes (7Saier Jr., M.H. Beatty J.T. Goffeau A. Harley K.T. Heijne W.H. Huang S.C. Jack D.L. Jahn P.S. Lew K. Liu J. Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Tseng T.T. Virk P.S. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar), including proton-coupled accumulation of nutrients and extrusion of xenobiotics, obligatorily linked substrate-product exchange, and membrane energization by virtual proton pumping. In E. coli cells, AdiC-mediated Arg-Agm exchange across the inner membrane is undetectable at neutral pH but is acutely activated by acid challenge (4Iyer R. Iverson T.M. Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2002; 419: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5Gong S. Richard H. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4402-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Iyer R. Williams C. Miller C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6556-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, this does not mean that AdiC itself is acid-activated since in cellular conditions, transport is strictly coupled to Agm generation by arginine decarboxylase, an acid-activated enzyme (26Blethen S.L. Boeker E.A. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1671-1677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were therefore motivated to study AdiC in isolation, removed from the complexities of the cytoplasm. To our surprise, we found that this membrane protein is overexpressed in E. coli, that it can be readily purified to homogeneity in monodisperse form, and that it is stable in detergent solution for several weeks at 4 °C. Approximately 10 mg of purified AdiC is routinely obtained per liter of bacterial culture, a circumstance that eases the pathway toward understanding the workings of the transporter. AdiC retains in vitro its essential biological function: electrogenic exchange of Arg for Agm at low pH. Electrogenicity is unsurprising under our usual assay conditions at pH 6, where Arg(+1) and Agm(+2) differ in charge, but it is noteworthy in view of the cellular conditions prevailing during acid shock. At pH 2, for instance, the carboxyl group of Arg (pKa ∼ 3.5) is over 95% protonated, and consequently, both substrates are almost always in the +2 form. Nevertheless, an electrogenic mechanism that in acidic conditions selects the rare Arg(+1) form is biologically necessary since electroneutral exchange of Arg(+2) for Agm(+2), being proton-neutral, would be useless for acid resistance (4Iyer R. Iverson T.M. Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2002; 419: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is satisfying that this inference from physiological purpose, an electrogenic mechanism for Arg-Agm exchange, is experimentally verified in the reduced, purified system. AdiC is a homodimer in phospholipid membranes and probably in detergent micelles as well. This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence, gel filtration in detergent being merely suggestive and cross-linking at limiting dilution in liposomes being compelling; quantitative cross-linking to a dimer in liposomes that contain only a single transporting unit cannot be reasonably understood otherwise. We hasten to emphasize that this result implies nothing at all about the exchange mechanism or the functional relevance of dimeric association. Transport could in principle involve cooperative cross-talk between the twin subunits, but it is also possible that the subunits work independently of one another, as in the fast gating of “double-barreled” CLC Cl– channels (27Miller C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 299: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 28Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13189-13198Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This report introduces some basic biochemical and functional characteristics of AdiC. The transporter is worthy of further detailed work because of its idiosyncratic biological function as well as for the opportunities it offers, through its compliant biochemical behavior, for understanding membrane transport proteins at mechanistic and structural levels.

https://openalex.org/W2012905650,"Impairment of both insulin and leptin action has been implicated in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. By assessing hepatic triglyceride (TG) stores in response to modulation of leptin action (by leptin infusion), we attempted to determine whether leptin has the major role in hepatic TG accumulation. TG were markedly decreased (by 63%, P<0.05) in young animals treated with leptin. However, this was also associated with improvement in hepatic insulin action (2-fold decrease in HGP during clamp, P<0.05). These effects on hepatic TG stores and insulin action were abolished in old rats who demonstrate leptin resistance. Since these experiments could not discern the role of leptin from the role of hepatic insulin action on hepatic TG stores, we further examined the effect of improvement of hepatic insulin action by visceral fat removal (VF-). Enhancement of hepatic insulin action in old VF-rats was associated with reduced hepatic TG stores (by 64% P<0.01). Because this manipulation may have induced an improvement in leptin action as well, we studied VF removal in a genetically leptin-resistant model (Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats, ZDF). Only in this mode was exclusive improvement of hepatic insulin action by VF removal not associated with reduced hepatic TG stores, suggesting that improved hepatic insulin action is not necessary for modulation of hepatic TG stores. By dissociating action of leptin from that of insulin, we suggest that the failure of leptin action is the major physiological mechanism for hepatic steatosis."
https://openalex.org/W2075238731,"Several microbial pathogens stimulate the ectodomain shedding of host cell surface proteins to promote their pathogenesis. We reported previously that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus activate the ectodomain shedding of syndecan-1 and that syndecan-1 shedding promotes P. aeruginosa pathogenesis in mouse models of lung and burned skin infections. However, it remains to be determined whether activation of syndecan-1 shedding is a virulence mechanism broadly used by pathogens. Here we show that Streptococcus pneumoniae stimulates syndecan-1 shedding in cell culture-based assays. S. pneumoniae-induced syndecan-1 shedding was repressed by peptide hydroxamate inhibitors of metalloproteinases but not by inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways previously found to be essential for syndecan-1 shedding caused by P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, or other shedding agonists. A 170-kDa protein fraction with a peptide hydroxamate-sensitive shedding activity was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the 170-kDa fraction is composed of ZmpB and ZmpC, two metalloproteinase virulence factors of S. pneumoniae. Both the purified 170-kDa ZmpB/ZmpC fraction and unfractionated S. pneumoniae culture supernatant generated syndecan-1 ectodomains that are smaller than those released by endogenous shedding. Further, a mutant S. pneumoniae strain deficient in zmpC, but not zmpB, lost its capacity to stimulate syndecan-1 shedding. These data demonstrate that S. pneumoniae directly sheds syndecan-1 ectodomains through the action of ZmpC. Several microbial pathogens stimulate the ectodomain shedding of host cell surface proteins to promote their pathogenesis. We reported previously that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus activate the ectodomain shedding of syndecan-1 and that syndecan-1 shedding promotes P. aeruginosa pathogenesis in mouse models of lung and burned skin infections.

These data demonstrate that S. pneumoniae directly sheds syndecan-1 ectodomains through the action of ZmpC. Numerous proteins can be released from host cell surfaces by a proteolytic cleavage mechanism known as ectodomain shedding (1Arribas J. Borroto A. Chem.

Approximately 2% of cell surface proteins are processed by this post-translational mechanism (1Arribas J. Borroto A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4627-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Ectodomain shedding can rapidly down-regulate protein expression at the cell surface and also generate soluble ectodomains that can function in a paracrine or autocrine manner. Interestingly, the list of shed proteins includes many mediators of tissue injury and inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, epidermal growth factor, FasL, L-selectin, and interleukin-6 receptor (1Arribas J. Borroto A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4627-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Blobel C.P.

Thus, ectodomain shedding is increasingly recognized as an important post-translational mechanism that regulates both infectious and noninfectious inflammatory processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that microbial pathogens can stimulate the ectodomain shedding of several proteins from host cell surfaces to promote their pathogenesis (5Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 6Schmidtchen A. Frick I. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Vollmer P.

For example, lipoteichoic acid of Staphylococcus aureus binds to platelet-activating factor receptor and activates a signaling mechanism that results in a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-10-mediated shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor in epithelial cells. Shed heparin-binding epidermal growth factor then activates the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor receptor to induce mucin overexpression, which promotes lung infection by obstructing airflow and inhibiting antibacterial agents (5Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Extracellular proteinases secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes shed dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, which bind to and inactivate neutrophil-derived α-defensins (6Schmidtchen A. Frick I. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Streptolysin O, a toxin virulence factor secreted by S. pyogenes, stimulates the shedding of L-selectin, interleukin-6 receptor, and CD14, and this is thought to dysregulate the host inflammatory response to promote streptococcal pathogenesis (8Walev I. Tappe D. Glubins E. Bhakdi S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 865-872PubMed Google Scholar, 9Walev I. Vollmer P. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Rose-John S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 7882-7887Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, secreted products of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, and Serratia marcescens activate interleukin-6 receptor shedding (7Vollmer P. Walev I. Rose-John S. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3646-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and those of S. epidermidis stimulate tumor necrosis factor-α shedding (10Mattson E. Van Dijk H. Verhoef J. Norrby R. Rollof J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4351-4355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that various microbial pathogens activate the ectodomain shedding of inflammatory factors to dysregulate the host response to infection and promote their pathogenesis. Syndecan-1 is a type I transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan predominantly expressed by epithelial cells and plasma cells, although it is also expressed by other cell types (e.g. endothelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts) to a lesser degree (11Bernfield M.

P. aeruginosa stimulates syndecan-1 shedding through LasA, a virulence factor for its lung infection, whereas S. aureus augments shedding through α- and β-toxins, two cytolytic toxins implicated in several staphylococcal infections. Interestingly, both P. aeruginosa LasA and S. aureus α- and β-toxins do not directly cause syndecan-1 shedding. Instead, they activate a protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) 2The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; HS, heparan sulfate; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; NMuMG, normal murine mammary gland; TAPI, tumor necrosis factor-α protease inhibitor. 2The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; HS, heparan sulfate; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; NMuMG, normal murine mammary gland; TAPI, tumor necrosis factor-α protease inhibitor.-dependent intracellular signaling mechanism that stimulates endogenous syndecan-1 shedding at the cell surface (14Park P.W.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 251-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). There are several indications that syndecan-1 shedding enhances bacterial virulence. Syndecan-1 shedding occurs in vivo when mice are infected with P. aeruginosa (20Haynes 3rd, A. Park P.W. Ruda F. Oliver J. Hamood A.N. Griswold J.A. Rumbaugh K.P. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Park P.W. Pier G.B. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Nature. 2001; 411: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and inhibition of syndecan-1 shedding with peptide hydroxamates reduces the virulence of P. aeruginosa in lung infections in mice (22Park P.W. Pier G.B. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Nature. 2001; 411: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Further, syndecan-1 null mice that are incapable of shedding their syndecan-1 ectodomains markedly resist P. aeruginosa and S. aureus lung infection relative to wild type mice (20Haynes 3rd, A. Park P.W. Ruda F. Oliver J. Hamood A.N. Griswold J.A. Rumbaugh K.P. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Park P.W. Pier G.B. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Nature. 2001; 411: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). How syndecan-1 shedding promotes bacterial pathogenesis is not completely understood, but syndecan-1 ectodomains bind to and inhibit various host defense factors, such as antimicrobial peptides, in a heparan sulfate (HS)-dependent manner (22Park P.W. Pier G.B. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Nature. 2001; 411: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, because soluble HS can inhibit several cytokines (23Xu J. Park P.W. Kheradmand F. Corry D.B. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5758-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Fritchley S.J. Kirby J.A. Ali S. Clin. Exp.

Chem. 2005; 280: 37558-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), syndecan-1 ectodomains might similarly inhibit cytokines through their HS moiety. These observations suggest that activation of syndecan-1 shedding is a broadly used pathogenic strategy to enhance microbial virulence. In this study, we investigated whether Streptococcus pneumoniae enhances syndecan-1 shedding. S. pneumoniae, a Gram-positive bacterium, is a major human pathogen that can cause both invasive and noninvasive infections, such as pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, and otitis media (27Hollingshead S.K. Briles D.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Tuomanen E.I. Austrian R. Masure H.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Our results show that S. pneumoniae can activate syndecan-1 shedding in a metalloproteinase-dependent but intracellular signaling-independent manner. Consistent with this activity, we also show that (i) biochemically purified fractions containing the S. pneumoniae shedding activity are composed of zinc metalloproteinase B (ZmpB) and ZmpC, (ii) purified S. pneumoniae zinc metalloproteinases directly shed syndecan-1 ectodomains, and (iii) S. pneumoniae metalloproteinases cleave syndecan-1 ectodomains at a site distinct from that cleaved by endogenous sheddases. Moreover, the deletion of zmpC was found to abrogate syndecan-1 shedding activity, whereas deletion of zmpB had no effect. These data indicate that S. pneumoniae directly sheds syndecan-1 ectodomains through ZmpC in a manner distinct from previously described mechanisms of syndecan-1 shedding.

Briefly, confluent NMuMG cells in 96-well plates were incubated with test samples diluted in the NMuMG culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml insulin) for the indicated time periods at 37 °C. The conditioned medium was collected and acidified by the addition of NaOAc (pH 4.5), NaCl, and Tween 20 to final concentrations of 50 mm, 150 mm, and 0.1% (v/v), respectively. Various volumes of acidified samples were dot-blotted onto the Immobilon Ny+ membrane, probed with 281-2 or Ky8.2 anti-syndecan-1 or -4 antibodies, and developed by ECL. Blots were scanned, and the intensity of dots was quantified by NIH Image software. Purification of the S. pneumoniae Syndecan-1 Shedding Enhancer—The TIGR4 strain was grown in 4 liters of THY broth for 8 h at 37 °Cto late log growth phase, and the culture supernatant was subjected to 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitate was resuspended in 50 ml of autoclaved deionized H2O, dialyzed three times against 4 liters of autoclaved deionized H2O, and lyophilized. The lyophilized sample was resuspended in 10 ml of DEAE binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl) and applied to a HiTrap DEAE FF 5-ml column pre-equilibrated with DEAE binding buffer. The applied sample was eluted with a 0.1–1.0 m NaCl gradient, and fractions were dialyzed against autoclaved deionized H2O and then tested for their capacity to shed syndecan-1 ectodomains by the cell culture-based shedding assay. Active fractions that eluted at ∼0.3 m NaCl were pooled, lyophilized, resuspended in 2 ml of TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), and fractionated by Sephacryl S-300 size exclusion chromatography. TBS was applied to the column at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and 10-min fractions (4 ml) were collected. Aliquots (200 μl) of each fraction were Speed Vacdried and resuspended in NMuMG culture medium, filtersterilized, and tested for their syndecan-1 shedding activity. This purification scheme typically yielded 0.8–1 mg of the purified 170-kDa syndecan-1 shedding enhancer from 4 liters of bacterial culture supernatant. Radioiodination and Autoradiography—The purified 170-kDa syndecan-1 shedding-enhancing protein (10 μg) was incubated with 20 μg of immobilized IODOGEN and 500 μCi of Na125I in 50 μl of TBS for 10 min at room temperature. Free 125I was separated from iodinated protein by PD-10 chromatography. To estimate the purity of the 170-kDa fraction, 3 ng of the radioiodinated sample was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was vacuum-dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax film with an intensifying screen at –80 °C. The film was scanned, and the intensity of radioactive protein bands was quantified using the NIH Image software. Mass Spectrometry and N-terminal Microsequencing—The purified 170-kDa protein fraction containing the syndecan-1 shedding activity was subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion after reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide. Tryptic digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) (ABI 4700 MALDI-TOF system) at the Baylor College of Medicine Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory (Houston, TX). MALDI-TOF MS peptide fingerprints were searched against public domain databases using MS-FIT software. One of the peptides with an m/z value of 1128.6 was further analyzed by MS/MS (ABI 4000 Q-TRAP LC MS/MS system). For N-terminal sequencing, the 170-kDa protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, excised, and analyzed by the ABI 477A peptide sequencer. Alternatively, the 170-kDa protein was digested with trypsin, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and the 50- and 30-kDa tryptic fragments were excised from the membrane and loaded onto the ABI 477A peptide sequencer. The deduced N-terminal sequence of the 50-kDa tryptic digest was searched by BLAST. Generation of Zinc Metalloproteinase Mutant Strains–Mutant strains devoid of the three zinc metalloproteinases were generated in the TIGR4 strain (Table 1). The strains were made by PCR ligation mutagenesis, creating gene replacements of the metalloproteinase genes with the Janus cassette containing the selectable marker aphIII, encoding kanamycin resistance (31Lau P.C.

Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5190-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers were designed to amplify the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of target genes zmpC, zmpB, and iga with genomic DNA from strain TIGR4 as template. Flanking amplicons were 500–1200 bp in length. Primers AEB-35F and AEB-31R were also used to amplify the 2903-bp Janus cassette. Restriction sites were integrated into the two primers nearest each target gene and into the Janus primers to allow for directional ligation as described (31Lau P.C. Sung C.K. Lee J.H. Morrison D.A. Cvitkovitch D.G. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2002; 49: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). After digestion of the amplicons, tripartite ligation of the flanking amplicons and the Janus cassette was carried out, and the ligation mix was used to transform competent S. pneumoniae TIGR4 as previously described (31Lau P.C. Sung C.K. Lee J.H. Morrison D.A. Cvitkovitch D.G. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2002; 49: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The expected replacement of each target gene with the aphIII gene by reciprocal recombination was confirmed in kanamycin-resistant transformants by PCR. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using STATVIEW 4.51 software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Differences between experimental groups and respective controls were examined by Student's t test. p values of <0.05 were deemed statistically significant. S. pneumoniae Activates Syndecan-1 Shedding—To determine whether S. pneumoniae strains possess the capacity to activate syndecan-1 shedding, nine S. pneumoniae strains with different capsular serotypes were examined for their shedding activity.

We show that CD47-SIRPα binding interactions are different between mice and humans, and we exploit phylogenetic divergence to identify the species-specific binding locus on the immunoglobulin domain of human CD47. All of the studies are conducted in the physiological context of membrane protein display on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Novel quantitative flow cytometry analyses with CD47-green fluorescent protein and soluble human SIRPα as a probe show that neither human CD47 nor SIRPα requires glycosylation for interaction. Human CD47-expressing CHO cells spread rapidly on SIRPα-coated glass surfaces, correlating well with the spreading of primary human T cells. In contrast, CHO cells expressing mouse CD47 spread minimally and show equally weak binding to soluble human SIRPα. Further phylogenetic analyses and multisite substitutions of the CD47 Ig domain show that human to cow mutation of a cluster of seven residues on adjacent strands near the middle of the domain decreases the association constant for human SIRPα to about one-third that of human CD47. Direct tests of cell-cell adhesion between human monocytes and CD47-displaying CHO cells affirm the species specificity as well as the importance of the newly identified binding locus in cell-cell interactions.

Cell-cell interactions are of course critical in immune function but can have important and revealing differences between species as well as nonlinear dependences on molecular parameters, such as affinity.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), have expanded considerably since the identification of SIRPα as a physiological ligand (3Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T.

SIRPα is also broadly expressed, present at high levels on myeloid lineages (monocytes, neutrophils) and neurons but absent from many if not most other cells (7van Beek E.M. Cochrane F. Barclay A.N. van den Berg T.K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7781-7787Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).

However, in humans as opposed to mice, severe reductions of CD47 levels on red cells, as found on various Rh-deficient patient cells, can occur with little to no evidence of anemia or enhanced clearance by splenic macrophages (17Bruce L.J.

On the SIRPα side, the N-terminal Ig domain is sufficient for the interaction with CD47 (21Vernon-Wilson E.F. Kee W.J. Willis A.C. Barclay A.N. Simmons D.L. Brown M.H. Eur. J.

Although it appears that the CD47-SIRPα interaction is enhanced by domain orientation with a conserved “long range” disulfide between the Ig domain and one of the extracellular loops of the membrane-spanning domain (20Rebres R.A. Vaz L.E. Green J.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34607-34616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), further information about the CD47 binding locus for SIRPα is limited to that of Liu et al. (24Liu Y.

However, the cross-species variation in the residues comprising a putative binding site did not match recent findings on species specificity of human SIRPα binding that show that human SIRPα binds to CD47 on red cells from pig and man but does not show detectable binding with red cells from mice, rats, or cows (25Subramanian S. Parthasarathy R. Sen S. Boder E.T. Discher D.E. Blood. 2006; 107: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Both Thr91 and Val115 are not conserved in pig CD47, suggesting that these amino acids are not required for SIRPα binding. Here we exploit the broad phylogenetic variation in CD47 (Fig. 1A)to identify the binding locus for species-specific interactions with SIRPα.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Invitrogen) was used as is or supplemented with either 1% BSA (Roche Applied Science) or 1% BSA plus 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma). Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (Bio-Rad) supplemented with Tween 20 (Sigma) and nonfat dry milk (Albertsons, Inc., Boise, ID) was used in Western blotting. Bordetella pertussis toxin (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), cytochalasin D (Sigma), latrunculin A (Sigma), and formaldehyde (methanol-free; Polysciences, Warrington, PA) were used in certain experiments. PKH26 and PKH67 cell labeling kits (Sigma) were used to label monocytes and T cells, respectively. All other reagents used were from Sigma unless noted otherwise.Antibodies—Primary antibodies are listed in Table 1. Secondary antibodies used for flow cytometry included AlexaFluor 647-conjugated rabbit anti-GST (Invitrogen) and AlexaFluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen).

(Tokyo). 1998; 123: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and other CD47 variants were typically PCR-amplified, digested with XhoI and BamHI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and ligated to similarly digested vector, pEGFP-N3 (Clontech), which results in an in-frame fusion of EGFP at the C terminus of full-length CD47. Single site mutants were prepared using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and multiple site mutants were prepared using sequential application of the QuikChange protocol or through gene synthesis by PCR. The CD47-encoding DNA segment was always sequenced prior to use. Sequence information for all oligonucleotides is available upon request.Transient Expression of CD47-GFP—CHO cells were plated at 105 cells/cm2 1 day prior to transfection. On the day of transfection, medium was replaced with 2 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) per 25 cm2 of surface area, and 10–15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 and 5 μg of plasmid DNA were diluted in 0.25 ml of Opti-MEM I separately and 5 min later were mixed together and incubated for at least 20 min at room temperature. Lipid-DNA complexes in a total volume of 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM I were then added to the flasks, incubated for 4–6 h, and then replaced with 5 ml of serum-containing medium. Transfected cells were harvested using DPBS supplemented with 2 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) 1–2 days post-transfection for analysis.Soluble Human SIRPα Production—The extracellular domain of human SIRPα1 fused to GST (referred to as “soluble SIRPα” or “SIRPα” henceforth) was prepared by transfection of COS-1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and the expression plasmid (6Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E.J. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein was purified from cell-free supernatant using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) as described previously (25Subramanian S. Parthasarathy R. Sen S. Boder E.T. Discher D.E. Blood. 2006; 107: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Aglycosylated soluble SIRPα was prepared by transfection in 10 μg/ml tunicamycin. Core-glycosylated soluble SIRPα (high mannose) was prepared by transfecting Lec 1 cells. Monocytic THP-1 cells do not show any significant reduction in SIRPα levels (>90% of untreated level) when grown in the presence of deoxyman-nojirimycin, suggesting that core glycosylation is sufficient for export, whereas tunicamycin treatment reduces levels significantly (∼30% of untreated level; data not shown). Soluble SIRPα production in COS-1 cells is also reduced in the presence of tunicamycin, which could, however, be related to off target effects.Fluorescent Labeling of Transfected CHO with Soluble SIRPα and CD47 Antibodies—Dynamic light scattering indicated that the GST-SIRPα plus anti-GST complex had a mean hydrodynamic radius, Rh ≈ 12 nm (by mass). Manufacturer-supplied measures of Rh for two large proteins (IgG, 160 kDa, 7.1 nm; thyroglobulin, 650 kDa, 10.1 nm) yield a power law fit of Rh = 2.0 × M0.25, and this correlation implies a molecular mass for the complex of M ≈ 1.3 MDa, consistent with gel filtration (M ≥ 1 MDa). Assuming two SIRPα (monomers) to two anti-GST, this molecular mass would imply approximately six SIRPα per complex. Five microliters of the soluble SIRPα (final concentration ∼1 μm); 5 μl of 2 mg/ml AlexaFluor 647 rabbit anti-GST; 40 μl of DPBS, 1% BSA; and ∼2.5 × 106 CHO cells were mixed and incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of cold DPBS, 1% BSA and analyzed immediately. For blocking, saturating antibody was added prior to soluble SIRPα. For antibody labeling, saturating levels of anti-CD47 antibody in 50 μl of DPBS, 1% BSA and ∼2.5 × 106 CHO cells were mixed together and incubated as above. Cells were washed in 0.5 ml of DPBS, 1% BSA and then resuspended in 50 μl of DPBS, 1% BSA containing 5 μl of secondary antibody (2 mg/ml). After an incubation of at least 20 min at room temperature, cells were washed once in 0.5 ml of DPBS and resuspended in 1 ml of DPBS, 1% BSA and kept on ice.Measurement of CD47 Density on Primary Cells—Anticoagulated human blood was treated with RBC lysis buffer (Sigma) and labeled with saturating levels of B6H12 (BD Biosciences) or BRIC126 (IBGRL) for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed twice with DPBS, 1% BSA and incubated with the saturating levels of secondary antibody for at least 30 min on ice. Cells were washed and resuspended in DPBS, 1% BSA and stored on ice until flow cytometric analysis. Mean fluorescence intensities were calibrated against washed human RBC (prepared separately) labeled with saturating B6H12/BRIC126 levels and the same secondary antibody. Surface areas were determined microscopically for detached CHO cells (460 μm2) and human T cells (184 μm2) approximating these cells as spherical (surface area = 4 × projected area). The upper bound estimate of 50,000 CD47 molecules on the surface of the human RBC (surface area = 128 μm2) was used (18Mouro-Chanteloup I. Delaunay J. Gane P. Nicolas V. Johansen M. Brown E.J. Peters L.L. Van Kim C.L. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Western Blotting—CHO cell lysates were prepared from frozen cell pellets lysed in DPBS containing 0.5% SDS and protease inhibitors (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and Na-EDTA) and further homogenized by passing through a 21-gauge needle. Cell lysates were denatured for 10 min at 100 °C after the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (Fisher) and then left untreated or incubated with peptide:N-glycanase (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA) or endoglycosidase Hf (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C overnight. Samples were then electrophoresed on BisTris gels (NuPAGE; Invitrogen) under reducing conditions in MOPS buffer and transferred to 0.2 μm polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) by shaking for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, washed with TTBS, and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-GFP secondary antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals) in TTBS for at least 60 min. The membrane was washed in TTBS and then in TBS and incubated with the alkaline phosphatase substrate, nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) until satisfactory color development.Cell Spreading Assay—200 μl of DPBS containing soluble SIRPα at 7 μg/ml was used to coat 35-mm dishes with glass coverslip bottoms (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA; available surface area ∼1.6 cm2) for 1 h at room temperature and then blocked with 200 μl of DPBS, 1% BSA or DPBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 for at least 1 h at room temperature. Just before adding cells, the block solution was removed, and the dish was washed with 2 ml of serum-free medium (CD-CHO(A) for CHO and AIM-V for T cells; Invitrogen), and then 2 ml of fresh medium was added and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 until the experiment. CHO cells expressing GFP fusions did not require additional labeling. However, human T cells were labeled with PKH67 (Sigma) immediately prior to cell spreading experiments. The dish was maintained at 37 °C using a heating stage. Cells were added, and images of the contact area under total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illumination were taken 5, 10, and 20 min after the addition of cells. 10-fold lower SIRPα levels gave no spreading of any cells over this time period.Cell-Cell Conjugate Assay—Human monocytes were labeled with PKH26 (Sigma) per instructions and mixed with CHO cells expressing GFP alone or GFP fusions of different CD47 variants incubated at room temperature in DPBS, 1% BSA for 30 min with intermittent mixing and analyzed by flow cytometry (after compensation using single color controls). The ratio of the number of clustered CHO cells to unclustered CHO cells is expressed as a percentage and denoted “percentage of CHO cells in clusters.”Flow Cytometric Analysis and Sorting—For analysis, forward scatter, side scatter, and fluorescence (FL1, FL2, and FL3 channels in logarithmic mode) were acquired for at least 10,000 events using a FACScan or FACSCalibur (BD Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). A BD FACSVantage™ SE cell sorter (with BD FACSDiVa™ option; BD Immunocytometry Systems) was used for cell sorting. CHO cells expressing three different levels of hCD47-GFP were simultaneously sorted into Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 30% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic. Approximately 6 × 105 cells from each subpopulation were collected, spun, and resuspended in CD-CHO(A) (Invitrogen) prior to use in cell spreading experiments.Microscopy—Images were acquired on a Nikon TE300 or Olympus IX71 inverted microscope with a ×60 (oil, 1.4 numerical aperture) objective using a Cascade CCD camera (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ). Image acquisition was performed with Image Pro software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). All subsequent image analysis was done using ImageJ (28Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). In cell spreading experiments, the contact area was measured using a 488-nm laser that illuminated ∼200 nm into the sample from the glass surface (TIRF mode).Homology Modeling and Molecular Dynamics—The amino acid (aa) sequence of the extracellular domain of human CD47 was aligned to the rat myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) sequence (Protein Data Bank code 1PK0) (29Breithaupt C. Schubart A. Zander H. Skerra A. Huber R. Linington C. Jacob U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9446-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) using ClustalW version 1.82 (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar). The alignment was submitted to Swiss Model (31Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar) to obtain a homology model. The obtained structure was further refined by molecular dynamics simulation (∼200 ps) and energy minimization (10,000 steps) in a box of explicit water (32Kale L. Skeel R. Bhandarkar M. Brunner R. Gursoy A. Krawetz N. Phillips J. Shinozaki A. Varadarajan K. Schulten K. J. Comput. Phys. 1999; 151: 283-312Crossref Scopus (2116) Google Scholar). The numbering of residues in CD47 neglects the first 18 amino acids that make up the signal peptide. A homology model of the N-terminal Ig domain of human SIRPα1 was also constructed using coordinates of the light chain variable region (VL) of a Fab structure (Protein Data Bank code 1RHH) (33Darbha R. Phogat S. Labrijn A.F. Shu Y. Gu Y. Andrykovitch M. Zhang M.Y. Pantophlet R. Martin L. Vita C. Burton D.R. Dimitrov D.S. Ji X. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1410-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with ∼22% sequence identity as template. Both Protein Data Bank structures are provided as supplemental files.Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—The MicroPoint laser (Photonic Instruments, St. Charles, IL) with a nanosecond pulse laser exciting the dye Coumarin 440 was used to photobleach CD47-GFP in adherent CHO cells. FRAP was performed by bleaching a small spot (diameter ∼2 μm) with multiple pulses of the laser, and the fluorescence recovery was determined by plotting the time profile of the background-corrected fluorescence in the bleached region normalized to the background-corrected total cell fluorescence signal.RESULTSDisplay of Wild-type CD47 and CD47-GFP Fusion—Full-length human CD47 (hCD47) was expressed with a C-terminal GFP tag in transiently transfected CHO cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The fusion protein localizes to the CHO cell membrane as is evident from the edge bright GFP fluorescence and also from binding of antibodies to the extracellular Ig domain of hCD47. Flow cytometry shows that expression levels vary by 1000-fold, with red cell and T cell densities near the midrange of CHO cell expression (Fig. 1C); the variation is usefully exploited here in a number of studies directed at clarifying the interaction.A soluble fusion of the human SIRPα1 triple Ig extracellular domain to GST was precomplexed with AlexaFluor 647-anti-GST, and this SIRPα was incubated with the CHO cells; SIRPα binds to single cells in proportion to the level of GFP fluorescence, whereas GST alone (plus anti-GST) does not show detectable binding. The anti-CD47 antibody B6H12 is known to inhibit binding (6Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E.J. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vernon-Wilson E.F. Kee W.J. Willis A.C. Barclay A.N. Simmons D.L. Brown M.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2130-2137PubMed Google Scholar) and indeed blocks binding here to background levels; the nonblocking antibody 2D3 (6Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E.J. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vernon-Wilson E.F. Kee W.J. Willis A.C. Barclay A.N. Simmons D.L. Brown M.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2130-2137PubMed Google Scholar) does not perturb binding, and neither does the intracellular GFP tag on CD47 nor a range of CHO cell treatments, such as heating to physiological temperature, cooling to 4 °C (to inhibit endocytosis), or disruption of the cytoskeleton (Fig. S1).For quantitative analysis of soluble SIRPα binding by flow cytometry, the hCD47-GFP expression range was split into eight bins (128 channels each), and the bin average binding was replotted on linear scales (Fig. 1D). The “binding slope” of each regressed line is simply the bound fluorescence normalized by expression level (i.e. the bound fraction, θ). By titrating soluble SIRPα, θ should and does vary hyperbolically with SIRPα (Fig. 1E). The saturable and specific binding of normal hCD47 binding to SIRPα yields an apparent dissociation constant Kd(app) = 0.7 μm and shows no cooperativity (Hill exponent = 1). For brevity, we will more simply denote Kd(app) by Kd henceforth. This method of analyzing flow cytometry binding data appears both novel and simple for the quantitative determination of affinities with transiently expressing cells. Moreover, determinations of the binding slope θ made with subsaturating concentrations of [SIRPα] ≤ Kd are clearly the most sensitive to structural perturbations as exploited below.Glycosylation Is Not Required for CD47 Export or SIRPα Interactions—Both CD47 and SIRPα are highly glycosylated proteins (5Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 34Mawby W.J. Holmes C.H. Anstee D.J. Spring F.A. Tanner M.J. Biochem.

Microfibrillar proteins mainly include fibrillins and microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs). MAGP-2 exhibits developmental expression peaking at elastic fiber onset, suggesting that MAGP-2 mediates elastic fiber assembly. To determine whether MAGP-2 regulates elastic fiber assembly, we used an in vitro model featuring doxycycline-regulated cells conditionally overexpressing exogenous MAGP-2 and constitutively expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged tropoelastin. Analysis by immunofluorescent staining showed that MAGP-2 overexpression dramatically increased elastic fibers levels, independently of extracellular levels of soluble tropoelastin, indicating that MAGP-2 stimulates elastic fiber assembly. This was associated with increased levels of matrix-associated MAGP-2. Electron microscopy showed that MAGP-2 specifically associates with microfibrils and that elastin globules primarily colocalize with MAGP-2-associated microfibrils, suggesting that microfibril-associated MAGP-2 facilitates elastic fiber assembly. MAGP-2 overexpression did not change levels of matrix-associated fibrillin-1, MAGP-1, fibulin-2, fibulin-5, or emilin-1, suggesting that microfibrils and other elastic fiberassociated proteins known to regulate elastogenesis do not mediate MAGP-2-induced elastic fiber assembly. Moreover, mutation analysis showed that MAGP-2 does not stimulate elastic fiber assembly through its RGD motif, suggesting that integrin receptor binding does not mediate MAGP-2-induced elastic fiber assembly. Because MAGP-2 interacts with Jagged-1 that controls cell-matrix interaction and cell motility, two key factors in elastic fiber macroassembly, microfibril-associated MAGP-2 may stimulate elastic fiber macroassembly by targeting the release of elastin globules from the cell membrane onto developing elastic fibers.

Elastic fibers are major insoluble extracellular matrix structures that provide connective tissues with flexibility and extensibility. These properties are critical to the functions of arteries, lung, skin, and all other dynamic tissues and have been essential requirements in the evolution of multicellular organisms. The importance of elastic fibers is highlighted by severe heritable connective tissue diseases caused by mutations in components of elastic fibers (1Milewicz D.M. Urban Z. Boyd C. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Elastic fibers are complex structures composed of two major components as follows: an inner core of amorphous cross-linked tropoelastin and an outer microfibril mantle composed of multiple proteins. Various other components of the elastic fiber localize at the elastin-microfibril or cell-elastic fiber interface (for review see Ref. 2Kielty C.M. Sherratt M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including fibulin-2, fibulin-5, and emilin-1. These elastic fiber-associated molecules are important mediators of elastic fiber assembly as deletion of these genes induces elastic fiber defects in mice (3Chu M. Communication: 2nd National Meeting of the American Society for Matrix Biology, San Diego, CA, November, 10-13, 2004, Abstr. 28.American Society for Matrix Biology. 2004; Google Scholar, 4Yanagisawa H.

Doliana R. Colombatti A. Volpin D. Bonaldo P. Bressan G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 638-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Microfibrils play an essential role in elastic fiber assembly by orchestrating deposition of tropoelastin onto the developing elastic fiber. Recent data have shown that a microfibril scaffold is required for deposition of tropoelastin into the extracellular matrix (6Kozel B.A. Ciliberto C.H. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This confirms previous ultrastructural studies showing that microfibrillar proteins are generally expressed prior to tropoelastin during development (7Mariencheck M.C. Davis E.C. Zhang H. Ramirez F. Rosenbloom J. Gibson M.A. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 31: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that elastin in early stages of assembly is always associated with microfibrils in developing elastic tissues (8Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1983; 10: 97-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Greenlee Jr., T.K. Ross R. Hartman J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1966; 30: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, because of the structural and functional heterogeneity of microfibrils, the molecular basis of tropoelastin alignment by microfibrils remains unclear. In this respect, each microfibrillar component may selectively determine the structure of microfibrils and/or their function in tropoelastin alignment. The biological role of these microfibrillar molecules is still under investigation. Fibrillin-1 and -2 are the principal structural components of microfibrils in elastic fibers (10Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 11Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Mutation of fibrillin-1 in the Tight-skin (Tsk) mice induces major alterations in microfibril structures (12Gayraud B.

Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). They also have a function in tropoelastin deposition as they regulate tropoelastin coacervation (14Clarke A.W. Wise S.G. Cain S.A. Kielty C.M. Weiss A.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10271-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). They are large glycoproteins that have distinct but overlapping pattern of expression (15Zhang H. Hu W. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Fibrillin-2 is generally expressed earlier in development than fibrillin-1 and may be particularly important in elastic fiber formation (16Pereira L. Andrikopoulos K. Tian J. Lee S.Y. Keene D.R. Ono R. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Biery N.J. Bunton T. Dietz H.C. Ramirez F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Apart from the fibrillins, MAGP-1 (microfibril-associated glycoprotein 1) is possibly the best candidate for an integral microfibril molecule important for structural integrity. It is associated with virtually all microfibrils and is widely expressed in mesenchymal and connective tissue cells throughout the development. MAGP-1 binds to amino-terminal exons 1-10 of fibrillin-1 (17Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39661-39666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) through its carboxyl-terminal region containing seven common cysteine residues (18Penner A.S. Rock M.J. Kielty C.M. Shipley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35044-35049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MAGP-1 forms ternary complexes with fibrillin-1 and decorin (19Trask B.C. Trask T.M. Broekelmann T. Mecham R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1499-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), as well as with biglycan and tropoelastin (20Reinboth B. Hanssen E. Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3950-3957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). MAGP-1 also binds to the α3 chain of type VI collagen (21Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). MAGP-2, the other member of this small microfibrillar protein family, is a 170-173 residue protein structurally related to MAGP-1 mainly in its central region. MAGP-2 contains an RGD motif through which it specifically binds to the αvβ3 integrin (22Gibson M.A. Leavesley D.I. Ashman L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and interacts with Jagged-1, an activating ligand for Notch receptor signaling (23Nehring L.C. Miyamoto A. Hein P.W. Weinmaster G. Shipley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20349-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). MAGP-2 is specifically associated with fibrillin-containing microfibrils. It binds to a carboxyl-terminal 7 tandem cbEGF-like repeat-containing region of fibrillin-1 through its carboxyl-terminal region (18Penner A.S. Rock M.J. Kielty C.M. Shipley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35044-35049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as well as to amino-terminal and central regions of fibrillin-1 (24Hansen H.E. Hew F.H. Moore G.

The role of MAGP-2 in microfibril structure remains unclear because it exhibits restricted patterns of tissue localization and developmental expression. However, it may have a specialized function in matrix homeostasis. We have recently shown that fibrosis in skin of scleroderma patients and Tsk mice is associated with increased MAGP-2 levels (13Lemaire R. Farina G. Kissin E. Shipley J.M. Bona C. Korn J.H. Lafyatis R. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and that MAGP-2 stimulates expression of type I procollagen (25Lemaire R. Korn J.H. Shipley J.M. Lafyatis R. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 1812-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Other evidence suggests that MAGP-2 may also modulate microfibril function in elastogenesis, as MAGP-2 is associated with elastin-associated microfibrils in developing nuchal ligaments (26Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Kumaratilake J.S. Sandberg L.B. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); MAGP-2 mRNA expression peaks at the period of onset of elastogenesis in this tissue (27Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and increased matrix-associated MAGP-2 in the hypodermis of Tsk mice is associated with increased elastic fiber assembly. Consistent with MAGP-2 function in elastogenesis, several fibrillin-1 mutations giving rise to Marfan syndrome have been mapped to the 7 cbEGF repeats-containing region that binds MAGP-2 (28Handford P.A. Downing A.K. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).

Cells and Plasmids—All cells used in this study were developed from a mouse embryonic fibroblast line (MEF 3T3; Clontech) that harbors the pTet-Off regulator, a plasmid expressing a tetracycline (tet)-controlled transactivator protein that binds to promoter tet-responsive element (CMVmin + TRE). MEF-TE cells constitutively overexpressing tropoelastin were created by transfecting MEF cells with pEGFP-bTE-FL, a vector supporting CMV-driven expression of bovine tropoelastin tagged with EGFP (B. Kozel). MG-TE cells conditionally overexpressing mouse MAGP-2 and constitutively tropoelastin were developed by transfecting MEF-TE cells with pTRE-MAGP-2, a vector supporting tet-regulated TRE-driven expression of MAGP-2 (25Lemaire R.

MGV5-TE and MGΔRGD-TE cells conditionally overexpressing V5-tagged MAGP-2 and ΔRGD MAGP-2, respectively, were developed by transfecting MEF-TE cells with pTRE2-MAGP2-V5 and pTRE2-MAGP2ΔRGD (25Lemaire R.

MEF-ΔcFbn cells conditionally overexpressing carboxyl-terminal truncated fibrillin-1 mutant were developed by transfecting MEF cells with pTRE-ΔcFbn-EGFP, vector supporting tet-regulated TRE-driven expression of the truncated fibrillin-1 mutant. pTRE-ΔcFbn-EGFP was constructed, first by creating pTRE-Fbn-1, a vector supporting conditional expression of wild-type fibrillin-1. pTRE-Fbn-1 was constructed by deleting the 3.0-kb Sph-1 fragment from pTRE2-Tsk fibrillin (13Lemaire R. Farina G. Kissin E. Shipley J.M. Bona C. Korn J.H. Lafyatis R. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), corresponding to the duplicated region within Tsk fibrillin-1, followed by religation. Second, a 792-bp EGFP cDNA-containing fragment from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted in-frame into pTRE-Fbn-1 in place of a 300-bp SacI/XbaI fragment, corresponding to the 91 carboxyl-terminal amino acid of fibrillin-1. Cell Transfection—Cell lines were transfected using Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were selected for 12-14 days using G418 (100 μg/ml) and hygromycin (60 μg/ml). 40-50 selected cell colonies were then ring-cloned, expanded, and analyzed for the transfected gene by Northern blot and Western blot. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Secreted proteins were precipitated from culture media by trichloroacetic acid. Proteins from cell and matrix layers were directly lysed in SDS-PAGE buffer, 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then incubated with primary polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against mouse MAGP-2 (1/1000 dilution) (13Lemaire R. Farina G. Kissin E. Shipley J.M. Bona C. Korn J.H. Lafyatis R. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), mouse fibrillin-1 (Ab9543, gift from L. Sakai), mouse fibulin-5 (1/2000, gift from B. Schiemann), bovine fibronectin (1/2000; Calbiochem), EGFP (1/1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or monoclonal mouse antisera to bovine α-tropoelastin (1/400, clone BA4; RDI, Flanders, NJ). The secondary antibody consisted of a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antimouse IgG antibody (1/10,000). Signal was detected using Supersignal West Pico or Femto chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) followed by autoradiography. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), separated by electrophoresis through a 1 m formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-H; Amersham Biosciences). Blotted RNAs were then hybridized to random primed 32P-labeled cDNA probes for either mouse MAGP-2, tropoelastin, or 18S ribosome, as described previously (29Kissin E.Y. Lemaire R. Korn J.H. Lafyatis R. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 3000-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown in Lab-Tek 8-chamber culture slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL), fixed for 10 min in paraformaldehyde at room temperature, blocked for 30 min with 3% BSA in TBS, and then incubated for 2 h with polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against either mouse MAGP-2 (gift from J.

Cells were washed three times with TBS for 5 min and incubated for 1 h with a rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at a 1/200 dilution. Specific fluorescence signals were then visualized by an Olympus BH-2 microscope under fluorescent light associated with high resolution Olympus DP70 camera. Exposure times were set manually and were identical between dox + and dox - conditions. Immunoelectron Microscopy of Elastic Fibers—MGV5-TE cells overexpressing MAGP-2 were plated 1/3 in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and cultured without dox in the presence of TGF-β. After 2 weeks, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed three times for 5 min with PBS, and aldehydes quenched with 0.1 m ammonium chloride for 10 min. Cells were then blocked for 30 min with 1% BSA/PBS, incubated with primary antibodies directed to MAGP-2-V5 and/or elastin-EGFP in 1% BSA/PBS for 90 min, washed three times for 5 min with PBS, and incubated with secondary gold-labeled anti-IgG antibodies in 1% BSA/PBS for 60 min. Immunolocalization of MAGP-2-V5 was performed using a mouse anti-V5 antibody in combination with a 6-nm gold-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1/30 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coimmunolocalizations of MAGP-2-V5 and elastin-EGFP were performed using two antibody combinations. The first combination used mouse antibody to V5 (1/100) and rabbit antibody to GFP (1/300, Ab290; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) associated with 6-nm gold-labeled anti-mouse and 18-nm gold-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. The second combination used rabbit antibody to MAGP-2 (1/200) and mouse antibody to bovine elastin (1/200, clone BA4) associated with 18-nm gold-labeled anti-rabbit and 6-nm gold-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Following antibody incubation, cells were washed three times for 5 min with PBS, prior to final fixation in 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer for 15 min on ice. Cells were then stained with 1.25% osmium tetroxide, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate for 30 min, washed three times for 5 min with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, incubated with 2% tannic acid in 0.1 m cacodylate for 30 min, washed three times with cacodylate buffer, rinsed twice for 5 min with 15% ethanol, followed by a 30-min incubation in 4% aqueous uranyl acetate before sequential dehydration with ethanol. The samples were then embedded in PolyBed812-filled gelatin capsules and baked at 60 °C for 18 h. 60-nm thin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined on a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. MAGP-2 Overexpression Stimulates Elastic Fiber Assembly in MEF Cells—As a tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying elastic fiber assembly, we used cultured MEF cells, a 3T3-derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line that assembles fibrillin microfibrils but not elastic fibers because tropoelastin is not expressed (Fig. 1A). Because these cells produce all components required to form the scaffolding of elastic fibers, but not tropoelastin itself, they provide an excellent in vitro system for studying elastic fiber assembly in association with constitutive expression of an exogenous tropoelastin molecule. To generate MEF cells constitutively expressing tropoelastin (MEF-TE cells), MEF cells were transfected with a vector supporting CMV-driven expression of bovine tropoelastin tagged with EGFP. Their ability to deposit exogenous tropoelastin onto microfibrils was then tested by EGFP fluorescence and immunofluorescence. Cells were cultured in the presence of TGF-β in order to maximize the assembly of fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils in the matrix (29Kissin E.Y. Lemaire R. Korn J.H. Lafyatis R. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 3000-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At 1-week post-confluence, MEF cells constitutively overexpressing tropoelastin (MEF-TE cells) showed a sparse and restricted network of thin developing elastic fibers that stretched between a discontinuous network of dense elastin globules (Fig. 1B). Importantly, MEF-TE cells cultured for longer times, up to a month, eventually showed a much more robust elastic fiber network as elastic fibers built up in diameter and length (data not shown). To investigate the role of MAGP-2 in elastic fiber assembly, we developed MEF-TE cells conditionally overexpressing exogenous mouse MAGP-2 (MG-TE cells) under the control of tet via the Tet-Off system (31Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). ME-TE cells, originally designed to constitutively express a tet-controlled transactivator, were stably transfected with a plasmid supporting mouse MAGP-2 expression under the control of the tet-responsive element. In the absence of dox, a tet analog, MG-TE cells showed high levels of MAGP-2 in the culture medium (Fig. 1C, dox -). In the presence of dox, MG-TE cells showed only low levels of endogenous MAGP-2 in the medium as expression of exogenous MAGP-2 is repressed (Fig. 1C, dox +). Overexpression of MAGP-2 did not change mRNA expression or medium levels of tropoelastin (Fig. 1, D and E, dox + versus dox -). Of note, TGF-β greatly enhanced levels of exogenous MAGP-2 present in the medium (Fig. 1C, dox -). This is associated with a similar increase in levels of exogenous MAGP-2 mRNA (data not shown). Because expression of exogenous MAGP-2 mRNA is driven by a CMV minimum promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”), this suggests that TGF-β stabilizes the MAGP-2 mRNA. To look at the effect of MAGP-2 overexpression on elastic fiber assembly, hyper-confluent MG-TE cells were cultured for 1 week with or without dox in the presence of TGF-β, and then elastic fibers were analyzed by EGFP fluorescence. Consistent with parental MEF cells (Fig. 1B), MG-TE cells cultured with dox, and therefore expressing only low levels of endogenous MAGP-2, showed an extremely poor and limited network of elastic fibers associated with numerous and prominent elastin globules (Fig. 2A, dox +). Thin, sparse developing elastic fibers stretched between these large elastin globules that were arranged in a discontinuous, loose network (Fig. 2B, panels d and j). In contrast, MEG-TE cells cultured with dox, and therefore overexpressing exogenous MAGP-2, showed a strong and extended network of elastic fibers (Fig. 2A, dox -). Elastic fibers were thick and dense and seemed to be generated from the aggregation of the elastin globules (Fig. 2B, panels c and i). Of note, both control transfection with the empty pTRE2 and control dox treatment of parental MEF-TE cells failed to alter elastic fibers assembly, indicating that the effect of MAGP-2 on elastic fibers was not because of either the plasmid pTRE-2 or dox (data not shown). These results suggest that MAGP-2 overexpression stimulates assembly of tropoelastin onto microfibrils, independent of extracellular levels of soluble tropoelastin available to the matrix (Fig. 1E). MAGP-2-induced Elastic Fibers Are Associated with Increased Matrix-associated Levels of MAGP-2—To investigate the molecular basis of the stimulation of elastic fiber assembly by MAGP-2, MG-TE cells were also stained in parallel for MAGP-2 by immunofluorescence. MG-TE overexpressing exogenous MAGP-2 showed a dramatic increase in matrix-associated MAGP-2 compared with the same cells expressing only endogenous MAGP-2 (Fig. 2B, panels a versus b and g versus h). Remarkably, increases in elastic fibers and matrix-associated MAGP-2 upon expression of exogenous MAGP-2 were closely associated as they largely colocalized (Fig. 2B, panels e and k). Similarly, in the absence of exogenous MAGP-2, the sparse network of elastic fibers also colocalized with basal endogenous matrix-associated MAGP-2 (Fig. 2B, panels f and l). MAGP-2-induced Matrix-associated Elastin Primarily Colocalizes with MAGP-2-associated Microfibrils and Forms Elastic Fibers—Ultrastructural analysis of elastic fibers assembled by MGV5-TE cells overexpressing V5-tagged MAGP-2 and EFGP-tagged tropoelastin was performed by EM associated with immunolocalization of MAGP-2 alone (Fig. 3, A and B) or in combination with elastin (Fig. 3, C and D). Gold-labeled anti-V5 and MAGP-2 antibodies targeting MAGP-2-V5 specifically localized to 10-12 nm fibrillin microfibrils within the matrix (Fig. 3, A-C, 6-nm gold labeling, and D, 18-nm gold labeling). This is consistent with previous immunoelectron microscopy studies performed on various animal tissues showing specific localization of MAGP-2 to fibrillin microfibrils (26Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Kumaratilake J.S. Sandberg L.B. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Dark, electron dense, globular structures typical of elastin were found exclusively associated with bundles of fibrillin microfibrils (Fig. 3, A-D), providing molecular evidence for the presence of elastic fibers in our in vitro system. Although a substantial amount of MAGP-2-associated microfibrils was elastin-free, elastin globules primarily localized to MAGP-2-associated microfibrils (Fig. 3, A-D), not to MAGP-2-free microfibrils (Fig. 3, A-C, arrowheads). These globules were gold-labeled by antibody to GFP targeting elastin-EGFP (Fig. 3C, 18 nm-gold particles) and antibody to bovine tropoelastin (Fig. 3D, 6 nm-gold particles), confirming their elastin nature. The lack of uniform labeling of these globules by the antibody to GFP is likely to represent a technical artifact inherent to the complexity of immuno-EM technique and/or lack of accessibility of EGFP epitopes within highly cross-linked elastin globules. Of note, control experiments using secondary 6- or 18-nm gold-labeled secondary antibodies alone showed no immunogold labeling (data not shown). The close association of elastin globules with MAGP-2 molecules within the matrix suggests that MAGP-2 facilitates elastic fiber assembly from its matrix-associated form, as opposed to its soluble non-bound form. To selectively assess the effect of matrix-associated and soluble MAGP-2 on elastic fiber assembly, we took advantage of the inability of soluble MAGP-2 provided as an external source from conditioned medium to assemble within the matrix of ME-TE cells (data not shown). ME-TE cells were cultured in high content MAGP-2-containing media conditioned from dox-regulated MG-TE overexpressing MAGP-2 and then elastic fibers analyzed by EGFP fluorescence. Although conditioned media were renewed every other day for 2 weeks, ME-TE cells cultured in MAGP-2-containing medium (dox -) showed no increase in elastic fibers compared with cells cultured in MAGP-2-free media (dox +) (data not shown). Because soluble MAGP-2 failed to stimulate elastic fiber assembly in matrix-associated MAGP-2-free conditions, this result supports the electron microscopy data, indicating that matrix-associated MAGP-2 mediates MAGP-2-induced elastic fiber assembly.

Here we demonstrate that LIN-9, designated as Mip/LIN-9, interacts with B-Myb but not with c-Myb or A-Myb. Mip/LIN-9 regulates the expression of B-Myb in a post-transcriptional manner, and its depletion not only decreases the level of the B-Myb protein but also affects the expression of S phase and mitotic genes (i.e. cyclin A, CDK1, and cyclin B). The critical role of Mip/LIN-9 on the expression of S and G2/M genes is further supported by the finding that coexpression of Mip/LIN-9 and B-Myb results in the activation of cyclin A and cyclin B promoter-luciferase reporters, and both proteins are detected on the cyclin A and B promoters. Interestingly, although Mip/LIN-9 promoter occupancy peaks earlier than B-Myb, the highest levels of expression of cyclins A and B correlate with the maximum binding of B-Myb to these promoters. These data support the concept that Mip/LIN-9 is required for the expression of B-Myb, and both proteins collaborate in the control of the cell cycle progression via the regulation of S phase and mitotic cyclins.

We identified two human forms encoding proteins with predicted molecular masses of ∼62 and 54 kDa, whereas in mouse cells only cDNAs encoding the 62-kDa form were isolated (10Sandoval R. Xue J.

A mutant form of the mouse gene that lacks the first 84 amino acids corrects the CDK4 null phenotype and restores the expression of E2F-regulated genes, indicating that mammalian Mip/LIN-9 functions in G1 downstream of CDK4 (10Sandoval R.

Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One of the Drosophila members of the Mip/LIN-9 family, Mip130, is part of a group of proteins designated as Mip (Myb-interacting proteins), which has a dual role regulating DNA replication at specific foci and transcription of specific genes (4Lewis W.P.

Cell. 2004; 119: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mip130 is part of a large complex termed dREAM (Drosophila RB, E2F, and Myb), which also includes other Myb-interacting proteins such as Mip40 and Mip120. Interestingly, the expression of some proteins in the complex is required for the stability of other components (4Lewis W.P. Beall L.E. Fleischer C.T. Georlette D. Link J.A. Botchan R.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2929-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 5Beall L.E. Bell M. Georlette D. Botchan R.M.

Mip130 is epistatic to Dm-myb because its deletion rescues the lethal phenotype produced by the knockout of Dm-myb (5Beall L.E. Bell M. Georlette D. Botchan R.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1667-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, these authors proposed that this lethal effect is because of unchecked repressor activity of Mip130. Unlike Drosophila, there are three mammalian Myb proteins: A-, B-, and c-Myb. The retroviral oncogene v-Myb is also a member of this family (for recent reviews see Refs. 11Joaquin M. Watson J.R.

As in the case of Dm-myb, the absence of B-Myb in mice produces an early embryonic lethal phenotype underscoring the role of B-Myb in development (16Tanaka Y. Patestos P.N. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J.

Blood. 2005; 105: 3855-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, CDK4, -6, and cyclin D complexes do not phosphorylate or activate B-Myb but rather inhibit its activity (30Ganter B. Fu S. Lipsick S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Horstmann S. Ferrari S. Klempnauer H.K.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One possible interpretation is that the CDK4, -6, and cyclin D complex may be responsible for impeding the early activation of B-Myb. Additionally, several lines of evidence also indicate that B-Myb functions downstream of p53. First, overexpression of B-Myb overcomes the growth arrest induced by p53 even in the presence of high levels of p21 and negligible CDK2/cyclin E kinase activity (34Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor M.P. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S. Appella E. Mercer E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Second, RAS and B-Myb are transforming in MEFs in the presence of normal p53 and ARF (35Masselink H. Vastenhouw N. Bernards R. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the deletion of B-Myb in DT40 cells impairs the response to DNA-damaging agents (36Ahlbory D. Appl H. Lang D. Klempnauer H.K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our present knowledge regarding the function of mammalian members of the Mip/LIN-9 family is limited to its role as a collaborator of pRB in tumor suppression and a downstream target of CDK4/cyclin D (1Gagrica S.

Because Drosophila Mip130 interacts with Dm-myb (4Lewis W.P. Beall L.E. Fleischer C.T. Georlette D. Link J.A. Botchan R.M.

Our results indicate that indeed, human and mouse forms of Mip/LIN-9 associate with B-Myb. The presence of mammalian Mip/LIN-9 is pivotal for the expression of the B-Myb protein because its depletion reduces the expression of B-Myb and its target genes cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1. The role of Mip/LIN-9 in cell proliferation was further demonstrated by the finding that in its absence p53–/– MEFs become contact-inhibited at lower densities. Moreover, Mip/LIN-9 participates in the regulation of S and G2/M genes as supported by the finding that coexpression with B-Myb produces a significant increase in luciferase activity of cyclin A- and B-promoter constructs. This effect is further increased by coexpression of a known activator of B-Myb, cyclin A (18Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marias R. Watson R.

The regulation of the expression of cyclins A and B by B-Myb and Mip/LIN-9 is at the promoter levels because both proteins associate with these promoters in ChIP assays. Surprisingly, although maximum promoter occupancy by Mip/LIN-9 precedes the peak in B-Myb binding, the latter has a closer temporal relationship with the highest level of protein expression for these cyclins. Altogether, these data support the concept that Mip/LIN-9 and B-Myb collaborate in the regulation of cell cycle progression by controlling the induction of S phase and mitotic cyclins. Tissue Culture, Constructs, and Transfections—U2OS, T98G, B-JAB, HL-60, NIH3T3, and p53–/– MEFs were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. MEFs were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 on 60-mm dishes 24 h before infection with the indicated retroviruses. Retroviruses (pBabe-puro and pBabe-puro-Mip/LIN-9 antisense) were produced in an ecotropic packaging cell line as described previously (37Pear S.W. Nolan P.G. Scott L.M. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Forty eight hours after infection, cells were selected in complete growth medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin for 14 days. Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (10Sandoval R. Xue J. Tian X. Barrett K. Pilkinton M. Baida G. Ucker D. Raychaudhuri P. Cook J.L.

Mip/LIN-9 mouse monoclonal (mAb) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb) against LIN-9 fusion proteins and peptides were developed in our laboratory (10Sandoval R. Xue J. Tian X. Barrett K.

Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were also used in these studies: anti-B-Myb (N-19, sc-724); -cyclin B (sc-245), A-Myb (sc-28686) and -cyclin A (sc-751) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-CDK1 antibody (610038) was from BD Transduction Laboratories; the anti-acetylated histone 4 and c-Myb were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; and the anti-tubulin antibody (ab3194) was from Abcam. Additionally, an anti-B-Myb serum was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Lewis. Densitometric analysis was performed using the computer program NIH Image version 1.62. Cell Cycle Synchronization—NIH3T3 cells or p53–/– MEFs were plated at 106 per 100-mm dish and 24 h later were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in serum-free DMEM for 48–72 h. Cells were released by changing medium to DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points following release. Synchronization was measured by FACS analysis of propidium iodine-stained cells. B-Myb Gene Expression Using Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA (0.3 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction using the Reverse-iT™ 1st strand synthesis kit from Abgene Biotechnologies Ltd. Real time quantitative PCR was achieved by using a cDNA equivalent of 30 ng of total RNA. The reaction was performed in 25 μl using SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was developed with the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Amplification was performed using a 2-min step at 50 °C and a 10-min denaturation step at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of primer annealing, and a polymerization step at 60 °C. Each sample was processed in triplicate, and the data are expressed as the mean threshold cycle (CT) ± S.D. Promoter and ChIP Assays—The luciferase assay system from Promega was used for promoter assays. Transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. T98G and U2OS cells were plated in triplicate at 2.5 × 105 per well in 12-well dishes 24 h before transfection with a total of 2.1 μg of plasmid DNA (0.6 μg of each construct and 0.3 μg of the reporter) (38Shimizu M. Nomura Y. Suzuki H. Ichikawa E. Takeuchi A. Suzuki M. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Control enhanced green fluorescent protein and pCMV vectors were used to maintain the total amount of DNA at 2.1 μg. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and read on a Victor 2 plate reader. ChIP assays were performed using the EZ ChIP (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) following the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Briefly, 107 cells per immunoprecipitation were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated to produce chromatin fragments between 500 and 1,000 bp. Chromatin was subsequently incubated with 2 μg each of preimmune mouse IgG (Sigma), Mip/LIN-9 mAb, B-Myb pAb (N-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or acetylhistone H4 antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoprecipitated samples were treated as described by the manufacturer's instructions, and purified DNA from the ChIP samples was assayed by semiquantitative PCR using primers for the E2F-regulated promoter sequences of mouse cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 as described previously (17Zhu W. Giangrande H.P. Nevins R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4615-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 39Rayman B.J. Takahashi Y. Indjeian B.V. Dannenberg H.J. Catchpole S. Watson J.R. Riele T.H. Dynlacht D.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). PCR amplicons were separated on 2% agarose gels and subsequently visualized by ethidium bromide staining. LIN-9 and B-Myb Form a Complex in Mammalian Cells–Because Drosophila Mip130 and Dm-Myb are part of the same protein complex, we sought to determine whether their mammalian homologs, Mip/LIN-9 and B-Myb, are also associated in human and mouse cells. To address this question, we performed coupled immunoprecipitation/Western blot using anti-B-Myb and anti-Mip/LIN-9 antibodies and protein lysates obtained from mouse and human cell lines. Fig. 1 shows that the anti-Mip/LIN-9 antibody (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lane 2) coprecipitates a protein that comigrates with endogenous B-Myb (lane 3) in p53–/– MEFs and human U2OS (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 4). In some human cells such as U2OS, a background band that migrates faster than the specific band for B-Myb is present in immunoprecipitations with the normal rabbit serum used as control for B-Myb (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Importantly, the reciprocal experiment shows that endogenous Mip/LIN-9 is coprecipitated by the anti-B-Myb pAb (Fig. 1, A and B, lower panels). The data obtained with human cells, which unlike mouse cells express both Mip/LIN-9 long and short, further indicate that B-Myb interacts with both forms of Mip/LIN-9 (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lane 2). These results demonstrate that endogenous Mip/LIN-9 and B-Myb, similarly to Mip130 and Dm-myb in Drosophila, are part of the same protein complex. Because there are extensive areas of homology among Myb family members, we next tested if Mip/LIN-9 was also able to interact with c-Myb and A-Myb. To address this issue, HL-60 and B-JAB cells, were used for coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Fig. 1C shows that anti-Mip/LIN-9 and c-Myb mAbs fail to coprecipitate c-Myb and Mip/LIN-9, respectively. Similarly, the Mip/LIN-9 and A-Myb mAbs do not coprecipitate A-Myb or Mip/LIN-9 (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that Mip/LIN-9 specifically interacts with B-Myb. To determine the region of Mip/LIN-9 involved in the interaction with B-Myb, 293 cells were transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion constructs encoding different regions of Mip/LIN-9. Fig. 1E shows that B-Myb interacts with the full-length form of Mip/LIN-9 and a truncation encoding residues 1–147. A much weaker interaction was observed with the region 148–542 suggesting that either the B-Myb-binding domain extends beyond amino acid 147 or another region of Mip/LIN-9 plays a minor role in the interaction. Depletion of Mip/LIN-9 Decreases the Expression of B-Myb and Its Transcriptional Targets Cyclins A2 and B1 and CDK1–We sought to determine the role of Mip/LIN-9 in cell cycle regulation using a knockdown approach. For these experiments, we selected p53–/– MEFs because they are immortal and contain wild type pRB, and previous reports suggested that B-Myb acts downstream of p53 (34Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor M.P. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S. Appella E. Mercer E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Masselink H. Vastenhouw N. Bernards R. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After several failed attempts to produce a knockdown using short interfering RNAs against the mouse gene (data not shown), we successfully reduced the expression of Mip/LIN-9 using a retrovirus carrying this gene in the antisense orientation. It quickly became evident that the puromycin-resistant clones carrying the antisense construct proliferated slower than a pool of p53–/– MEFs infected with empty vector (see below). Clones were expanded and tested for the expression of Mip/LIN-9. Fig. 2 (A and B, upper and lower panels) shows that the antisense construct reduced the expression of Mip/LIN-9 by 60–75% of control cells (empty vector) after normalization by the expression of tubulin. Similar results were obtained with other clones obtained from two independent antisense infections of p53–/– MEFs (data not shown). Immunoblotting of asynchronously growing MEFs with an anti-B-Myb pAb (Fig. 2B, upper panel) revealed that B-Myb was also decreased in all three clones. Moreover, the decrease in Mip/LIN-9 also affected the expression of B-Myb-regulated genes (17Zhu W. Giangrande H.P. Nevins R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4615-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) such as cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). To determine whether the decrease in B-Myb was because of transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms, we performed real time PCR with cells expressing the Mip/LIN-9 antisense construct or control vector. Fig. 2C shows that there are no differences in the transcription of B-Myb or control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase between Mip/LIN-9 AS cells and controls, indicating that the decrease in B-Myb expression is because of post-transcriptional mechanisms. Experiments intended to determine whether the mechanism involved proteosomal degradation or translational regulation did not provide conclusive results (data not shown). For instance, treatment with the proteosomal inhibitor MG132 increased the expression of Mip/LIN-9 in control cells with no clear effect on B-Myb. Cell proliferation studies also demonstrated that the absence of Mip/LIN-9 and the decrease in B-Myb and its regulated genes affected the pattern of proliferation of p53–/– MEFs, because clones expressing the antisense construct plateau at lower densities than cells expressing empty vector (Fig. 2D). Moreover, cells carrying the antisense construct remained flat and were not transformed by oncogenic RAS, whereas control cells were spontaneously transformed in culture after a few passages (data not shown). These results suggest that Mip/LIN-9 regulates the expression of B-Myb, as well as S and G2/M genes required for cell proliferation. Mip/LIN-9 Collaborates with B-Myb in the Induction of Cyclin A and Cyclin B—We next determined the effect of the knockdown of Mip/LIN-9 on cell cycle re-entry of serum-starved cells after being released in growth medium. Although p53–/– MEFs expressing control vector showed limited synchronization, likely due to the known fact that the lack of p53 leads to the acquisition of additional mutations in culture and spontaneous transformation, the induction of cyclin A occurs at 12 h when cells star"
https://openalex.org/W2006618556,"We report the first crystal structures of a family II pyrophosphatase complexed with a substrate analogue, imidodiphosphate (PNP). These provide new insights into the catalytic reaction mechanism of this enzyme family. We were able to capture the substrate complex both by fluoride inhibition and by site-directed mutagenesis providing complementary snapshots of the Michaelis complex. Structures of both the fluoride-inhibited wild type and the H98Q variant of the PNP-Bacillus subtilis pyrophosphatase complex show a unique trinuclear metal center. Each metal ion coordinates a terminal oxygen on the electrophilic phosphate and a lone pair on the putative nucleophile, thus placing it in line with the scissile bond without any coordination by protein. The nucleophile moves further away from the electrophilic phosphorus site, to the opposite side of the trimetal plane, upon binding of substrate. In comparison with earlier product complexes, the side chain of Lys296 has swung in and so three positively charged side chains, His98, Lys205 and Lys296, now surround the bridging nitrogen in PNP. Finally, one of the active sites in the wild-type structure appears to show evidence of substrate distortion. Binding to the enzyme may thus strain the substrate and thus enhance the catalytic rate.

The universally present inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase, EC 3.6.1.1) 4The abbreviations used are: PPase, pyrophosphatase; PNP, imidodiphosphate; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. is a central enzyme of phosphorus metabolism. PPases are essential enzymes, because they hydrolyze the inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) generated during a number of ATP-dependent cellular processes and thus provide the necessary thermodynamic pull for them (1Kornberg A. Kasha M. Pullman B. Horizons in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1962: 251Google Scholar). PPases require divalent metal cations for catalysis. Soluble PPases comprise two families, which differ completely in both sequence (2Shintani T. Uchiumi T. Yonezawa T. Salminen A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Hachimori A.

Biol. 1999; 23: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) occur in all types of cells from bacteria to man, whereas family II PPases occur almost exclusively in bacteria. Of the 57 known family II PPases, 53 occur in eubacteria, 3 in archaebacteria, and 1 in a unicellular eukaryote (Giardia lamblia). Three Vibrio species, including Vibrio cholerae, have genes for both family I and family II PPases. The frequent occurrence of family II PPase in human pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus agalactiae causes neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis; Streptococcus mutans, dental caries; and V. cholerae, cholera) makes studies of this enzyme medically important. In addition, family II PPases belong to the “DHH” family of phosphoesterases, named after the characteristic DHH amino acid signature (7Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 17-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes have similar structures (5Ahn S. Milner A.J. Futterer K. Konopka M. Ilias M. Young T.W. White S.A.

In contrast to family I PPases, which have a simple cup-like single-domain structure, family II PPases have two domains, with the active site at the domain interface (4Merckel M.C. Fabrichniy I.P.

The C-terminal domain of family II PPase contains the high affinity substrate-binding site, whereas the catalytic site that binds the nucleophile-coordinating metal cations is located in the N-terminal domain. Closure of the C-terminal domain onto the N-terminal one creates the catalytically competent conformation by bringing the electrophilic phosphate of substrate into the catalytic site (9Fabrichniy I.P.

The natural metal cofactor of family I PPases is Mg2+, binding to the enzyme with micromolar affinity, whereas family II enzymes are best activated by Mn2+ or Co2+, which bind with nanomolar affinity. With these metal ions, family II PPases are ∼10-fold more active than family I PPases (kcat of 1700-3300 s-1 versus 110-330 s-1) (10Zyryanov A.B. Vener A.V. Salminen A. Goldman A. Lahti R.

Biophys. 2000; 379: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Mg2+ confers lower activity but greater substrate-binding affinity on family II PPases than Mn2+ (Kd of 60 μm versus 180 μm), whereas, in family I enzymes, the reverse is true (13Zyryanov A.B. Shestakov A.S. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 901-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several structures of family II PPases are available: S. mutans (Sm-PPase) complexed with Mn/Fe3+ and two sulfates (4Merckel M.C. Fabrichniy I.P. Salminen A. Kalkkinen N. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A.

Zyryanov A.B. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14403-14411Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); Bacillus subtilis (Bs-PPase) complexed with with only Mn2+ (5Ahn S.

Salminen A. Zyryanov A.B. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14403-14411Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The crystal structures showed that the preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+ in family II PPases is at least partly due to the histidine ligands that bind the metal ions and bidentate carboxylate coordination of metal ion in the binding site (4Merckel M.C. Fabrichniy I.P. Salminen A. Kalkkinen N. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, our recent structural data revealed a more subtle reason. Substrate binding to family II PPase appears to require a change in the coordination number of the high affinity metal site from five to six (9Fabrichniy I.P. Lehtiö L. Salminen A. Zyryanov A.B. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14403-14411Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Varied five/six-coordinated geometry is typical for transition metals, such as Mn2+ or Co2+, but not for Mg2+, which is almost always six-coordinated (14Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Consequently Mn2+ and Co2+ fit the catalytic machinery better than Mg2+. Furthermore, Zn2+, which does not form six coordination easily (14Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), is a very poor activator of family II PPase (9Fabrichniy I.P. Lehtiö L. Salminen A. Zyryanov A.B. Baykov A.A. Lahti R.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14395-14402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the structural data described above do not explain the 10-fold difference in kcat between the two PPase families. Our goal here was to solve the first structures of a family II PPase with a PPi analogue, imidodiphosphate (PNP). We therefore crystallized the fluoride-inhibited WT-Bs-PPase·Mg4·F·PNP complex, and the virtually inactive H98Q variant with PNP and the water nucleophile: H98Q-Bs-PPase·M4·H2O·PNP. Protein Preparation and Crystallization—Native Bs-PPase and its H98Q variant were expressed and purified as described previously (16Halonen P. Tammenkoski M. Niiranen L. Huopalahti S. Parfenyev A.N. Goldman A. Baykov A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4004-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The protein stock solutions, 35-40 mg/ml, were dialyzed against 83 mm TES/K+ buffer (pH 7.2) containing 17 mm KCl and 0.05 mm EGTA to remove metal ions (16Halonen P. Tammenkoski M. Niiranen L. Huopalahti S. Parfenyev A.N. Goldman A. Baykov A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4004-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Reagents were analytical grade from Sigma. To prepare the WT-Bs-PPase·Mg4·F·PNP complex, the protein stocks were supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm NaF and incubated for 5-10 min at room temperature followed by addition of 1 mm PNP and a further 5-min incubation. The protein was then crystallized in sitting-drop vapor diffusion setups at 4 °C in a 3:2-ml mixture of protein sample:well solution (100 mm HEPES/K+ (pH 7.5), 2.3-2.5 m ammonium sulfate, 3-4% polyethylene glycol 400). The ammonium sulfate was ultra-pure, to make the concentration of transition metal cations as low as possible. Large single rhombic crystals (1.0 mm × 0.8 mm × 0.5 mm), space group P212121 appeared within 2-3 days and diffracted to 1.75-Å resolution at the ESRF (Table 1). The same method and similar reagents were used to crystallize the H98Q variant. These crystals diffracted to 2.15-Å resolution on our home source (Table 1). The complex we obtained, however, contains H2O instead of F-, and Fe3+ and Mn2+ in addition to Mg2+ (see below). As a control, we also solved the structure without NaF, and the position of the density in the active site was unchanged (Table 2). This shows that the atom between M1, M2, and M4 is water, not F-, in the H98Q crystals.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsWT-Bs-PPaseH98Q-Bs-PPaseData collectionWavelength (Å)0.9341.544Space groupP212121P212121Cell dimensions, a, b, c (Å)60.0, 115.9, 147.959.9, 115.2, 148.1Resolution (Å)1.75 (1.80-1.75)2.15 (2.19-2.15)RsymaRsym = ∑i|Ii- 〈I 〉|/∑ 〈I 〉, where I is an individual intensity measurement and 〈I 〉 is the average intensity for this reflection with summation over all data.0.052 (0.452)0.086 (0.399)I/σ(I)14.9 (2.8)15.0 (3.3)Completeness (%)99.9 (100)98.9 (97.9)Redundancy4.2 (3.2)3.7 (3.4)RefinementResolution (Å)20-1.7530-2.15No. reflections99,32350,598RworkbRwork is defined as ∑|Fobs|-|Fcalc|/∑|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively. / RfreecRfree is the R-factor for the test set (5% of the data, randomly chosen).0.166/0.1860.169/0.205Residues included (total 309)A: 2-308; B: 1-308A: 2-308; B: 1-308No. atomsProtein4,9404,771Ligand/ion10974Water436486B-factors (Å2)Protein44.433.5Ligand/ion53.944.7Water47.635.4r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.0160.015Bond angles (°)1.521.47Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored regions91.890.7Additionally allowed8.29.3regionsa Rsym = ∑i|Ii- 〈I 〉|/∑ 〈I 〉, where I is an individual intensity measurement and 〈I 〉 is the average intensity for this reflection with summation over all data.b Rwork is defined as ∑|Fobs|-|Fcalc|/∑|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively.c Rfree is the R-factor for the test set (5% of the data, randomly chosen).

Open table in a new tab Data Collection and Processing—Crystals were briefly transferred to mother liquor supplemented with 18% glycerol and flash-frozen in a boil-off liquid nitrogen stream. Synchrotron data were collected for WT-Bs-PPase on beamline ID14-EH1 (λ = 0.934 Å) at the ESRF, Grenoble, France. Data for H98Q-Bs-PPase were collected at home using CuKα radiation from a RU300 Rigaku rotating anode generator fitted with confocal mirrors and a Raxis IV+ image plate detector. Data were processed with XDS (17Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3241) Google Scholar) and the HKL package (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38600) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Structure Solution and Refinement—The structures were solved by molecular replacement with CNS (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Lahti R. Goldman A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14403-14411Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) as a search model. We refined the structures with CNS using the MLF target and checked and rebuilt the models using O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Water molecules were built with CNS or ARP/wARP (21Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). The final rounds of refinement (Table 1), including TLS (translation, libration, and screw rotation displacement) refinement, were done with Refmac (22Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13910) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 Program Suite (23P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19795) Google Scholar). The occupancies of the active site ligands were verified by refinement in CNS (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar). Both structures contain residues 2-308 in monomer A and residues 1-308 in monomer B out of the total 309 residues. The stereochemistry of the resulting models was good: PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.V. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) classified all the residues in the most favored and additional allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). Structures were overlaid and displayed in O. The electron density maps were calculated with CNS and Refmac, and the figures were generated with PyMOL. 5W. L. DeLano (2002) PyMOL, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA. Identification of the Metals—To differentiate between enzyme-bound Mg2+ and transition metal cations, we used anomalous difference Fourier maps. Two 5.5-6.0 σ anomalous peaks observed at the positions of both M1 and M2 metal binding sites in the H98Q-Bs-PPase structure, collected at 1.54 Å wavelength, indicated the presence of atoms heavier than Mg2+. In agreement with this, the (2Fo - Fc) electron-density peaks associated with the M1 and M2 sites were too large (7-9 σ) to be Mg2+. Fluorescence scans carried out at the ESRF around the manganese, iron, cobalt, and zinc K-edges indicated that only manganese and iron (presumably Mn2+ and Fe3+) were present (data not shown). We therefore collected anomalous diffraction data just above and below the manganese and iron absorption edges in order to be able to calculate the occupancies of both metal ions in the active sites (Table 2). Data above and below the iron K-edge were collected on ESRF beamline BM14, and data from the same crystal were collected above and below the manganese K-edge at ESRF beamline ID23-EH1 (Table 2). We also collected data from H98Q-Bs-PPase crystals grown in the presence and in the absence of fluoride to see if there was any difference between them (Table 2). The geometry for Mn2+ and Mg2+ bound to PPase metalbinding sites was evaluated using angular distortion as previously described (9Fabrichniy I.P. Lehtiö L. Salminen A. Zyryanov A.B. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14403-14411Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. between the ideal geometry angles and those observed in the structures, δ, gives a measure of the correspondence to the tested coordination type. Kinetic Measurements—Imidodiphosphate hydrolysis was assayed at 25 °C by measuring phosphate accumulation with a sensitive Malachite green procedure (27Smirnova I.N. Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reaction medium contained 1 mm free Mg2+, 1 mm PNP, 83 mm TES/KOH buffer, pH 7.2, 50 μm EGTA, and 17 mm KCl. In calculating the rate of the enzymatic reaction, we took into account that the second product (phosphoramidate) is rapidly converted into phosphate in strongly acidic medium in the course of phosphate determination (28Chanley J.D. Feageson E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 1181-1190Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The amount of substrate consumed was thus assumed to equal half of the phosphate released. PNP as Substrate—The dissociation constant for PNP binding to family II PPases (12 μm (29Zyryanov A.B. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2005; 70: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)) is reasonably close to that for PPi (60 μm (10Zyryanov A.B. Vener A.V. Salminen A. Goldman A. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), in agreement with their very similar three-dimensional structures (30Larsen M. Willett R. Yount R.G. Science. 1969; 166: 1510-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the rate of PNP hydrolysis at its saturating concentration (1 mm) by Mg-Bs-PPase occurred with a catalytic constant of only 0.014 s-1 (Fig. 2). This is 104 times lower than for PPi (11Parfenyev A.N. Salminen A. Halonen P. Hachimori A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24511-245118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The time course of PNP hydrolysis showed no initial burst of product formation at comparable product and enzyme concentrations, indicating that hydrolysis of enzyme-bound PNP is the ratelimiting step of the process. The rate of hydrolysis was further decreased in the presence of fluoride (Fig. 2), which had a KI of 12 ± 2 μm. The rate of PNP hydrolysis by H98Q-Bs-PPase was undetectable indicating that it was at least 200-fold lower than for WT. Overall Conformation of the WT- and H98Q-Bs-PPase Structures—The very low activity of Bs-PPase against PNP in the presence of fluoride allowed us to solve the structure of the Bs-PPase·Mg4·F·PNP complex. On the other hand, the inactivating mutation on the active site histidine (H98Q) and serendipitous crystallization with transition metal cations (see below) made it possible to crystallize its PNP complex without fluoride anion. Both WT- and H98Q-Bs-PPase PNP-bound structures are in the closed conformation, similar to that in the Sg- and Bs-PPase structures containing one sulfate molecule bound to the high affinity substrate-binding site Sul2 (5Ahn S. Milner A.J. Futterer K. Konopka M. Ilias M. Young T.W. White S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Fabrichniy I.P. Lehtiö L. Salminen A. Zyryanov A.B. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14403-14411Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In both WT and H98Q variant structures, the two monomers in the asymmetric unit are very similar with r.m.s.d./Cα of 0.22-0.33 Å. In addition the N-terminal domains are very similar to all known Bs-PPase and other family II PPase structures (r.m.s.d./Cα of 0.15-0.39 and 0.73-0.80 Å, respectively). As the structures are so similar, the discussion of WT and the H98Q variants is conflated. In addition, we only discuss monomer A in the WT and H98Q asymmetric units, unless there are significant differences between monomer A and monomer B. Metal Binding—In contrast to all earlier structures of family II PPase, four metal ions are bound to the active site of each monomer in both WT-Bs-PPase and H98Q variant structures when crystallized together with PNP (Fig. 3). For WT, all four cations are clearly Mg2+, based on three lines of evidence. First, in an anomalous map calculated from data collected at 0.934 Å (Table 1), the peak heights at M1 and M2 are below the noise level of the map (data not shown). Second, the B-factors for the metal ions refined as Mg2+ are ∼34 Å2, similar to the surrounding residues. Finally, WT-BsPPase clearly contains PNP (Fig. 3C), which means that fluoride is very likely to be present as an inhibitor, and F- binds to Mg2+-containing, not Mn2+-containing, BsPPase (10Zyryanov A.B. Vener A.V. Salminen A. Goldman A. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Kuhn N.J. Wadeson A. Ward S. Young T.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Conversely, anomalous difference Fourier calculations on the H98Q-BsPPase structure using data collected at the CuKα wavelength (Table 1) clearly indicated the presence of transition metal ions. X-ray fluorescence scans (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that the ions present were Fe3+ and Mn2+. By collecting data sets above and below the absorption edges, we could identify both the positions and the amounts of the transition metal ions in the active site; they are in sites M1 and M2 alone, consistent with earlier data (4Merckel M.C. Fabrichniy I.P. Salminen A. Kalkkinen N. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Ahn S. Milner A.J. Futterer K. Konopka M. Ilias M. Young T.W. White S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Fe3+: Mn2+ ratio is about 6:1 in site M1 and about 2:1 in site M2, based on the peak heights (Table 2 and Fig. 4A). Apparently, traces of Mn2+ and Fe3+ were present in amounts sufficient to fill the M1 and M2 sites even in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+; this is consistent with the nanomolar affinity of family II PPase for transition cations (10Zyryanov A.B. Vener A.V. Salminen A. Goldman A. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In SmPPase, Mn2+ and Fe3+ do not exchange for Mg2+ even in the presence of a large excess of Mg2+ (4Merckel M.C. Fabrichniy I.P. Salminen A. Kalkkinen N. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We could thus trap the OH- on the enzyme. Because transition metal cations occupy the M1 and M2 sites, water/OH-, not fluoride, must be bound. This can be seen in two ways. First, the position of the nucleophile is the same when the H98Q variant crystals are grown in the absence of fluoride; i.e. when the site must be occupied by water/hydroxide ion (data not shown) and, second, this position is slightly different than it is in the WT-BsPPase·Mg4·F·PNP complex (Fig. 4A). In both structures, the metal ions M1 and M2 are bound to six conserved residues from the N-terminal domain. M2, which binds tightest (9Fabrichniy I.P. Lehtiö L. Salminen A. Zyryanov A.B.

https://openalex.org/W2034407646,"Regulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), the primary NO receptor, is linked to NO binding to the prosthetic heme group. Recent studies have demonstrated that the degree and duration of sGC activation depend on the presence and ratio of purine nucleotides and on the presence of excess NO. We measured NO dissociation from full-length α1β1 sGC, and the constructs β1(1–194), β1(1–385), and β2(1–217), at 37 and 10 °C with and without the substrate analogue guanosine-5′-[(α,β-methylene]triphosphate (GMPCPP) or the activator 3-(5′-hydroxymethyl-3′-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1). NO dissociation from each construct was complex, requiring two exponentials to fit the data. Decreasing the temperature decreased the contribution of the faster exponential for all constructs. Inclusion of YC-1 moderately accelerated NO dissociation from sGC and β2(1–217) at 37 °C and dramatically accelerated NO dissociation from sGC at 10 °C. The presence of GMPCPP also dramatically accelerated NO dissociation from sGC at 10 °C. This acceleration is due to increases in the observed rate for each exponential and in the contribution of the faster exponential. Increases in the contribution of the faster exponential correlated with higher activation of sGC by NO. These data indicate that the sGC ferrous-nitrosyl complex adopts two 5-coordinate conformations, a lower activity “closed” form, which releases NO slowly, and a higher activity “open” form, which releases NO rapidly. The ratio of these two species affects the overall rate of NO dissociation. These results have implications for the function of sGC in vivo, where there is evidence for two NO-regulated activity states.

In response to NO, sGC produces the second messenger cGMP, modulating physiological processes such as neurotransmission and vasodilation (6Munzel T. Feil R. Mulsch A. Lohmann S.M. Hofmann F. Walter U. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2172-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The α1β1 sGC heterodimer is activated several hundredfold above the basal level by the binding of NO to the heme of the β1 H-NOX domain (7Stone J.R.

Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how this binding event is translated into increased catalytic activity. The mechanism by which sGC deactivation occurs has been a focus of much investigation (8Brandish P.E. Buechler W.

Initially thought to result from simple dissociation of NO from the heme, the deactivation process has turned out to be more complicated. In fact, regulation of sGC by NO has been shown to involve a complex interplay between binding of NO to the heme and to non-heme sites as well as allosteric regulation by GTP, also a substrate, and ATP, a reporter for the energy status of the cell (15Cary S.P.L. Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In integrating the inputs from all these signals, sGC has been shown to have a remarkable attribute, the ability to exist in a stable low activity state or a transient high activity state, both containing NO bound to the heme (16Cary S.P.L. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Russwurm M. Koesling D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4443-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Many questions concerning the existence and characteristics of these two sGC heme-NO species, and how they might be regulated by NO and nucleotides, remain to be addressed. In addition to responding to cellular inputs, sGC can be activated by a class of small molecules exemplified by 3-(5′-hydroxymethyl-3′-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1). These molecules not only activate sGC in the absence of heme ligands but also synergize with the NO- and CO-bound forms of the enzyme to reach maximal activity. There has been much speculation about the binding site and mechanism of action of YC-1 (18Hering K.W. Artz J.D. Pearson W.H. Marletta M.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

By using purified sGC, and sGC heme domain constructs (Fig. 1) that possess heme characteristics similar to those of the full-length α1β1 enzyme (21Karow D.S. Pan D. Davis J.H. Behrends S.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15959-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we carried out spectroscopic and kinetic analyses of NO dissociation in the absence and presence of YC-1 and the substrate analogue guanosine-5′-[(α,β-methylene]triphosphate (GMPCPP), as well as activity studies with YC-1. Dissociation was found to exhibit two exponential phases, the relative contributions of which could be differentially affected by YC-1, GMPCPP, or changes in temperature. We propose a model for dissociation of NO from sGC involving the existence of two 5-coordinate sGC heme-NO species indistinguishable by electronic absorption spectroscopy but clearly different in their ability to release NO from the heme; this model is discussed in context of the current hypothesis for regulation of sGC by NO and nucleotides.

Sf9 cells were obtained from the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology Tissue Culture Facility, University of California, Berkeley. Rat lung sGC α1 and β1 cDNAs were provided by Dr. Masaki Nakane, Abbott. H-NOX domain constructs from rat sGC β1 and β2 subunits (β1(1–194), β1(1–385), and β2(1–217)) were purified as described (21Karow D.S. Pan D. Davis J.H. Behrends S. Mathies R.A.

CO gas was from Praxair. GMPCPP was from Jena Biosciences. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Baculovirus Construction—Rat sGC β1 cDNA was inserted between the NotI and XbaI sites of the plasmid pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) to generate pFastBac1/sGCβ1. PCR was used to insert an in-frame C-terminal RGS-H6 tag in front of the stop codon of the α1 cDNA. The forward primer was 5′-TGGCGGCCGCAAGGAGGAAACCAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CGTCTAGATTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGAGATCCTCTATCTACCCCTGATGCTTTGCCTAAGAAGTTAGCGTTTCC-3′. PCR products were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired changes (University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core Facilities). The H6sGC α1 gene was inserted between the NotI and XbaI sites of pFastBac1 to generate the construct pFastBac1/sGCα1. The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used to generate recombinant baculoviruses from pFastBac1/sGCα1 and pFastBac1/sGCβ1 according to the manufacturer's protocol. High titer stocks of recombinant baculoviruses were prepared by standard methods. Optimization of the amount of each virus used for protein production was carried out as described previously (23Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. DiValentin M. Schelvis J.P. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10848-10854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Production of Recombinant sGC—Sf9 cells were cultured in Ex-Cell 420 insect serum-free medium (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) at 28 °C. Cultures were grown in 2800-ml Fernbach flasks with shaking at 135 rpm. Cells were subcultured between 0.7 × 106 and 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cell density and viability were determined by trypan blue exclusion using a hemocytometer. For protein expression, 1-liter cultures of Sf9 cells at a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/ml in 2800-ml Fernbach flasks were infected with H6α1 and β1 recombinant viruses. Cells were harvested 3 days post-infection by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at –80 °C. Purification of Recombinant sGC—All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen cell pellets from 5-liter expression cultures were thawed on ice and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm KH2PO4, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm Pefabloc (Pentapharm), 1 mm benzamidine, 5% glycerol) plus Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Resuspended cells were broken with a Bead Beater (BioSpec Products) using 0.1-mm diameter glass beads, and the lysate was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant was applied to a 2.5-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a BioLogic LP (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with buffer A until the A280 was stable, and then an aliquot of buffer A (25 ml) was brought to 1.2 m NaCl and applied to the column. The column was washed with 50 ml of 12.5 mm imidazole in buffer A and eluted with 25 ml of 125 mm imidazole in buffer A, collecting 2-ml fractions during the elution. Fractions containing sGC (identified by yellow color) were pooled, concentrated to 1–1.5 ml in a Vivaspin-20 50K filter (Vivascience), and exchanged into buffer B (25 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol)) on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The sample was diluted to ∼7 ml with buffer B and applied to a 2-ml prepacked POROS HQ2 anion-exchange column (Applied Biosystems) at 2 ml/min using a BioLogic Duo Flow (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer B and developed with a 35-ml 120–285 mm gradient of NaCl in buffer B, collecting 1-ml fractions. Fractions containing purified sGC (exhibiting an A278/A431 < 1.1) were pooled, concentrated in a Vivaspin-6 50K filter, drop-frozen in liquid N2, and stored in liquid N2. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE using pre-cast 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and was routinely greater than 95%. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad) or calculated from the A431 using an extinction coefficient of 148,000 m–1 cm–1 (8Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Dissociation of NO from the Heme of β1(1–194), β1(1–385), β2(1–217), and sGC—The dissociation of NO from the heme of each H-NOX domain construct and sGC was measured at 37 and 10 °C using the CO/dithionite trapping method described previously (16Cary S.P.L. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The trapping solution was prepared as follows: a solution of sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl was prepared in a Teflon-sealed Reacti-Vial (Pierce) using an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products). The solution was removed from the anaerobic chamber and saturated with CO by bubbling the gas through the solution for 10 min. Protein-NO complexes were formed by incubation with excess DEA/NO (in 10 mm NaOH) at 25 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl for 10 min. Complete conversion to the nitrosyl species was verified by following the shift in the Soret maximum from 431 to 399 nm. Stock solutions of YC-1 were made in Me2SO. When present, YC-1 concentrations ranged from 0.96 to 96 μm, and the final concentration of Me2SO was 1%. Experiments with GMPCPP contained 10–1000 μm nucleotide (added before DEA/NO addition) and included 5 mm MgCl2, which alone had no effect on NO dissociation. Proteins were placed in a septum-sealed anaerobic cuvette and deoxygenated using an oxygen-scavenged gas train. A small amount of DEA/NO (∼3 eq) was added just before deoxygenation to maintain the nitrosyl species (any remainder was subsequently destroyed by the large excess of Na2S2O4 in the trapping solution). The head space of the anaerobic cuvette was replaced with CO, and the cuvette and trap solutions were equilibrated at assay temperature for 1 min. The reaction was initiated by addition of CO/dithionite solution to the anaerobic cuvette with a Hamilton gas-tight syringe and mixing. The final concentration of Na2S2O4 in the reaction mixture was 30 mm. Final protein concentrations were 1.9–2.5 μm for β1(1–194), β1(1–385), and β2(1–217), and 0.88–2.5 μm for sGC. Data collection was initiated ∼10 s after trap addition. The reaction was monitored by electronic absorption spectroscopy using a Cary 3E spectrophotometer equipped with a Neslab RTE-100 temperature controller. Data were collected over the range of 380–450 nm at 909 nm/min with a 1.5-nm data point interval. Spectra were recorded every 18 s for 5 min, every 1 min for 10 min, and every 2 min thereafter for a total of 3 h, or until the reaction was complete. A buffer base line was subtracted from each spectrum, and spectra were corrected for base-line drift by normalization to an isosbestic point at ∼410 nm. For data obtained in the absence of YC-1 or GMPCPP, difference spectra were obtained by subtraction of the time 0 spectrum from all subsequent spectra. To obtain difference spectra for data acquired in the presence of YC-1 or GMPCPP, a time 0 spectrum from a reaction carried out in the absence of either compound and containing an identical amount of protein was subtracted from all subsequent spectra, and all time points were offset by an amount corresponding to the mixing time for the experiment. Values for the change in absorbance at 423 nm (ΔA423; β1(1– 194) and β1(1–385)) or 424 nm (ΔA424; sGC and β2(1–217)) were extracted from the difference spectra and plotted versus time to obtain dissociation time courses for each experiment. Dissociation time courses were obtained in duplicate or triplicate, and each experiment was repeated 2–5 times over several days. Generally, because of the relative difficulty in obtaining large amounts of purified sGC, ΔA424 values for full-length sGC, which are proportional to the experimental protein concentrations, were smaller than for the heme domain constructs. YC-1 Activation of the sGC-NO Complex—End point assays were performed in triplicate at 10 and 37 °C as described previously (25Derbyshire E.R. Tran R. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16257-16265Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of DEA/NO (10 mm) were prepared in NaOH (10 mm). Stock solutions of YC-1 (15 mm) were prepared in Me2SO. Assay mixtures contained 0.2 μg of sGC in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 μm YC-1 where indicated. sGC was incubated with DEA/NO (100 μm) for 10 min at 25 °C and equilibrated at assay temperature for 1 min. Assays were initiated by addition of GTP and MgCl2 to 1 and 3 mm, respectively. Final assay volumes were 100 μl and contained 2% Me2SO, which did not affect enzyme activity. Reactions were quenched after 3 min by the addition of 400 μl of 125 mm Zn(CH3CO2)2 and 500 μl of 125 mm Na2CO3. cGMP quantification was carried out using a cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit, format B (Biomol), per the manufacturer's instructions. Each experiment was repeated four times to ensure reproducibility. Data Analysis and Statistics—Curve fitting, data analysis, and figure generation were carried out using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). The data from each dissociation experiment were fit to single or double exponentials as shown in Equations 2 and 3 under “Results” to obtain observed rate constants. To determine whether a single exponential or two exponentials best fit the data, the residuals from each fit were compared. Additionally, for each set of dissociation data, the fit to a single exponential was compared with the fit to two exponentials using the F test. A two-exponential fit was considered better than a one-exponential fit if p < 0.0001. For dissociation experiments, rates are expressed as means ± S.D. For activity assays, significant differences between the means were determined using the two-tailed t test; the significance level used was 0.05. Kinetic Considerations; Developing a Model for NO Dissociation from sGC—The binding of NO to the sGC heme has been shown to proceed through initial formation of a 6-coordinate intermediate, followed by rupture of the iron-histidine bond to form the final 5-coordinate ferrous nitrosyl complex (7Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 26Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The simplest mechanism for dissociation of NO from the 5-coordinate sGC heme-NO complex would be the reverse of NO binding as follows: rebinding of the proximal histidine ligand to form a 6-coordinate heme-NO intermediate followed by dissociation of NO to form a 5-coordinate histidyl-ligated heme, as shown in Scheme 1. heme-NO5C⇌kHdkHrheme-NO6C⇌kon[NO]koffheme5C+NOSCHEME 1 The values of kHr and kHd are the rate constants for rebinding and dissociation, respectively, of the proximal histidine ligand; kon is the rate constant for binding of NO to the heme, and koff is the rate constant for the dissociation of NO from the 6-coordinate heme-NO complex. In this study, we employed an NO trap, consisting of a sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) solution saturated with CO (COsat), to obtain rates for dissociation uncomplicated by NO rebinding. This system has been used previously to determine the NO dissociation rates for a number of heme proteins (16Cary S.P.L. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At the concentrations of dithionite and CO used in these experiments, the reaction of NO with dithionite and the binding of CO to the vacated heme coordination site are not rate-limiting (Refs. 24Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and 29Boon E.M. Davis J.H. Tran R. Karow D.S. Huang S.H. Pan D. Miazgowicz M.M.

Thus, under our NO-trapping conditions, the above reaction scheme simplifies to Scheme 2, heme-NO5C⇌kHdkHrheme-NO6C→koffheme-COSCHEME 2 where koff is the rate constant for the dissociation of NO from the 6-coordinate heme-NO complex to form the CO complex, which is irreversible because of the COsat/dithionite trap. Assuming a steady-state equilibrium between heme-NO5C and heme-NO6C, Equation 1 can be derived for the observed reaction rate after mixing (derivation of the first-order rate constant kobs for mechanisms similar to that described in Scheme 2 has been discussed in detail (29Boon E.M.

Importantly, when starting from a mixture of heme-NO5C and heme-NO6C, if koff is faster than kHr, a two-exponential increase as described by Equation 3 is predicted, ΔAt=ΔA1(1-e-k1t)+ΔA2(1-e-k2t)(Eq. 3) where ΔAt is the change in signal amplitude at time t; ΔA1 and ΔA2 are the contributions of each exponential process to the total change in signal amplitude, and k1 and k2 are the observed rate constants for each process. That is exactly what is observed for dissociation of NO from several prokaryotic H-NOX domains, for which the heme-NO complexes have been demonstrated to exist as an equilibrium mixture of 5- and 6-coordinate states (29Boon E.M. Davis J.H. Tran R. Karow D.S. Huang S.H. Pan D. Miazgowicz M.M. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21892-21902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, previous studies using electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy have demonstrated that for sGC and the sGC H-NOX constructs studied in this work, the heme-NO complex is exclusively 5-coordinate (21Karow D.S. Pan D. Davis J.H. Behrends S. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16266-16274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Deinum G. Stone J.R. Babcock G.T.

From these observations, it can be inferred that there is no appreciable amount of heme-NO6C in a solution of NO-bound sGC, relegating heme-NO6C to the status of a transient intermediate in the dissociation reaction pathway. Thus, in order to accommodate any observed two-exponential dissociation of NO, Scheme 2 must be expanded to include an additional 5-coordinate heme-NO species, as shown in Scheme 3, heme-NO5C*⇌kCkOheme-NO5C⇌kHdkHrheme-NO6C→koffheme-COSCHEME 3 where heme-NO*5C and heme-NO5C are two 5-coordinate heme-NO species that are spectroscopically identical but kinetically distinct. In this mechanism, the 5-coordinate heme-NO complex of sGC exists as an equilibrium mixture of 5-coordinate heme-NO species (heme-NO*5C and heme-NO5C), with slow interconversion between the two forms compared with NO dissociation. A two-exponential NO dissociation time course would be observed if, upon mixing with the NO trap, NO dissociated from the heme-NO5C fraction with a kobs according to the reaction in Scheme 2, with the remainder of the dissociation reaction proceeding from the heme-NO*5C fraction, as indicated in Scheme 3, and dependent on the rate of interconversion between 5-coordinate species (kO – kC). Thus, the observation of two exponentials versus one in the dissociation of NO from a sGC H-NOX domain would indicate that NO dissociates from a mixture of 5-coordinate heme-NO species, with ΔA1 and ΔA2 proportional to the amount of each species at the start of the dissociation reaction. Dissociation of NO from sGC and sGC H-NOX Domain Constructs at 37 °C—In the presence of the NO trap (COsat/dithionite), dissociation of NO from the heme of sGC and sGC H-NOX domain constructs resulted in an increase in absorbance at 423–424 nm because of formation of the heme-CO complex. A representative set of difference spectra for dissociation at 37 °C from sGC, β1(1–194), β1(1–385), and β2(1–217) is shown in Fig. 2. The corresponding plots of ΔA423 or ΔA424 against time, shown in the top panels of Fig. 3, A–D, yield a dissociation time course for each construct. For each dissociation time course, the fits to both single and double exponentials (Equations 2 and 3) are shown. The residuals for each fit are plotted above each time course. In each case, examination of the residuals suggested that a two-exponential fit provided a better model for the data than a single exponential fit. A comparison of the one- and two-exponential fits using the F test supported the two-exponential fit as the better model in each case (p < 0.0001). The two rate constants obtained for each construct (a faster constant k1 and a slower constant k2, averaged from 2–4 experiments per construct) and the amplitudes of each corresponding phase (as a percent of the calculated total) are shown in Table 1. The observed data are consistent with a model where dissociation proceeds from an initial equilibrium mixture of two 5-coordinate heme-NO complexes, as outlined in Scheme 3. Accordingly, we propose that k1 corresponds to dissociation of NO from the heme-NO5C conformation at a rate equal to kobs in Equation 1, whereas k2 represents the observed rate of reaction, corresponding to kO – kC, that is limited by the slower conversion from heme-NO*5C to heme-NO5C.FIGURE 3Time courses for dissociation of NO from sGC and H-NOX domain constructs at 37 °C.

Neuregulin in the absence of GDNF was relatively ineffective. Soluble receptors for neuregulins blocked the effects of GDNF and SNL-CM, suggesting that both neuregulin and GDNF are required for effective formation of long spermatogonial chains.

Such spermatogonia isolated from SD-Tg(ROSA-EGFP)2-4Reh rats are also referred to herein as GFP+ spermatogonia.Feeder Cell Lines—The STO (SIM mouse embryo-derived thioguanine and ouabain resistant)-neomycin-LIF 76/7 fibroblast line (SNL) was a gift from Allan Bradley, and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (cDMEM) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. MSC-1 Sertoli cells were a gift from Michael D. Griswold and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 medium, 1:1, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B (DHF12), and 8.5% FBS at 32.5 °C in 5.5% CO2. Prior to culture with testis cells, feeder cell lines were prepared as previously described (10Hamra F.K. Schultz N. Chapman K.M. Grellhesl D.M. Cronkhite J.T. Hammer R.E. Garbers D.L. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Spermatogenesis Colony Forming Assays—To analyze colony formation in vitro, the number of aligned spermatogonia formed from freshly isolated testis cells (day 0) was scored on culture day 9. Standard incubation conditions were: 0.5-1 × 104 cells plated/cm2, DHF12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 30 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, minus or plus added test reagents, at 32.5 °C in 5.5% CO2. On day 9, the cultures were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde, labeled with the anti-TEX14 IgGs using our reported protocol for immunocytochemistry (10Hamra F.K. Schultz N. Chapman K.M. Grellhesl D.M. Cronkhite J.T. Hammer R.E. Garbers D.L. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and then the number of GFP+/TEX14+ Aal spermatogonia formed in each culture were scored by counting on a fluorescent microscope. For characterization and isolation of factors from SNL-CM, cultures of spermatogonia were initiated on S-laminin. Compared with laminin, S-laminin stimulated the formation of 4-fold more total Aal spermatogonia (TEX14+, GFP+)/well at the 8-32-cell stages in response to GDNF (supplemental Fig. S1). At plating densities of less than 104 cells/cm2 on S-laminin, individual colonies of GFP+ spermatogonia were composed of individual chains formed by intercellular bridges based on TEX14 expression. Therefore, under these conditions the number of independent chains/well is considered to be equal to the number of GFP+ colonies/well.To analyze colony formation in vivo, WT Sprague-Dawley rats at 12 days of age were injected (intraperitoneal) with 12.5 mg/kg busulfan (4 mg/ml in 50% Me2SO) and then used as recipient males at 24 days of age. Donor rat germ cells (GFP+) isolated from culture were loaded into injection needles fashioned from 100 μl of glass capillary tubes at ∼3 × 103 GFP+ cells/65 μl of culture media (DHF12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 30 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.04% trypan blue. The entire 65-μl volume was then transferred into the seminiferous tubules of anesthetized rats by retrograde injection through the rete of their right testes (50Ogawa T. Dobrinski I. Brinster R.L. Tissue Cell. 1999; 31: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The number of GFP+ colonies formed/testis were scored by using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Inc.) to visualize donor cell transgene expression in the seminiferous tubules at 32 days following transplantation.Collection of Conditioned Medium—SNL fibroblasts were grown as monolayers in plastic culture dishes (10 cm) containing 10 ml of cDMEM. The cDMEM was removed from confluent cultures by aspiration, and then the monolayers in each dish were rinsed with 12 ml of serum-free cDMEM (sfDMEM)/dish. The sfDMEM used to rinse the monolayers was thoroughly removed from each culture and then replaced with 10 ml of fresh sfDMEM/dish. The cultures were then maintained for 2 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 2 days, the conditioned sfDMEM (SNL-CM) was removed from the cultures and transferred into sterile 50-ml tubes. The collected SNL-CM was centrifuged at ∼3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, using a Beckman GPR tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant liquid was retained and stored frozen in sterile T75 flasks at -40 °C.Concentration of SNL-CM—For pilot experiments, 400 ml of SNL-CM was processed under sterile conditions using an Amicon 8400 ultrafiltration apparatus fitted with 3000 Mr cut-off filters (YM3, Millipore). This step yielded 26 ml of retentate fluid (15× SNL-CM) and 374 ml of filtrate fluid. To identify factors that stimulate spermatogonial development by purification techniques, 10 liters of SNL-CM were collected and processed by the same method to yield ∼125 ml of retentate fluid (80× SNL-CM) and ∼875 ml of filtrate fluid. Retentate and filtrate fluid were stored frozen at -40 °C until further use.Purification of Spermatogenic Factors from Conditioned Medium—The preparation of 80× SNL-CM was fractionated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC runs were supported using a Hewlett-Packard 1100 Series HPLC work station equipped with on-line monitoring, and off-line analysis software (HP Chem-Station). The 80× SNL-CM was adjusted to 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and injected onto a preparative C4, HPLC column (22 × 250 mm, TP214 Vydac, Inc.) equilibrated at 1% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Bound components of the SNL-CM were then eluted from the column using a two-step linear gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentration over 120 min (1% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from 0 to 15 min, then 1 to 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from 15 to 120 min) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Column fractions (8 ml/fraction) containing peaks of activity from duplicate columns runs (60 ml, 80× SNL-CM/run) were pooled, concentrated on a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, Inc.), suspended to 2 ml in sterile column buffer (100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.9), and then further fractionated over a 25/60, Sephacryl-200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in column buffer using a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Column fractions (5 ml/fraction) containing activity were pooled, concentrated on a SpeedVac, suspended to 1 ml in 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and then further fractionated over a semi-preparative, C4, HPLC column (10 × 250 mm, TP214, Vydac, Inc.) using a two-step linear gradient (20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from 0 to 5 min, then 20-50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from 5 to 90 min) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Fractions containing activity were pooled, concentrated on a SpeedVac, suspended to 1 ml in 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and then further fractionated over an analytical C4, HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, TP214, Vydac, Inc.) using a two-step linear gradient (20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 0-5 min, then 20-40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from 5 to 90 min) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/ml. A portion of the fraction (10% of total fraction volume) containing the peak of biological activity was then fractionated by electrophoresis over an 8% acrylamide gel. Based on pilot experiments, seven slices of acrylamide (1 mm, height) were dissected from the lane loaded with the active fraction spanning the 36- and 64-kDa prestained molecular weight markers (Sea Blue, Invitrogen, Inc.). The dissected gel slice fractions were place in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.5 ml of DHF12-FBS, minced with a scalpel, and agitated for 16 h at 1000 rpm at 22-24 °C. The fractions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min in a table top microcentrifuge. The supernatant fluid was maintained and tested for biological activity.Production of Sertoli Cell-modified Laminin (S-Laminin)—The rat Sertoli cell line, ASC-17D, was obtained from Barry R. Zirkin (Johns Hopkins Medical School) and was maintained at 32 °C in 5.5% CO2 in DHF12 medium supplemented with 8.5% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (ASC medium). Culture plates were pre-coated with 2.2 μg/cm2 mouse laminin for 4 h at 22-24 °C. The ASC-17D cells were suspended in ASC medium then plated into the laminin-coated wells (1.5 × 105 cells/cm2) and maintained at 32 °C in 5.5% CO2 for 2 days. To remove the ASC-17D cells from the S-laminin, cultures were treated for 4 h with fresh ASC medium containing 10 μg/ml of mitomycin-C. The mitomycin-C-containing medium was removed and the cells were rinsed 2 times with 0.5 ml/well of ASC medium prior to the subsequent addition of fresh ASC medium. The cultures were then maintained for another 6 days. Medium was replaced with fresh ASC medium on the third day. Six days after mitomycin-C treatment the medium was again removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of sterile water/well. The water was removed from the wells after 10 min. The plates of S-laminin were allowed to air dry in the cell culture hood for 3-4 h and then were stored at 4 °C until use.TEX14 Antibody Production and Purification—Synthetic peptides, TEX14-1 (CNMTLLDPTKGSTREKKTKDQ) and TEX14-2 (CTKGSTREKKTKDQDMVEQKR) were produced based on an amino acid sequence that was deduced from PCRamplified cDNA. The cDNA was first synthesized from total RNA from rat LB germ cells. The partial sequence encoded the carboxyl terminus of the rat TEX14 protein (NCBI accession U46694). Amino-terminal cysteine residues were added for conjugation to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce, Inc.). Purified conjugates were used to raise polyclonal antisera in rabbits. Preimmune and immune sera were processed over protein-A affinity columns (Hi-Trap, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Purified IgG fractions from immune sera were further purified by affinity chromatography using the antigenic TEX14-1 and TEX14-2 peptides (Sulfolink Kit, Pierce, Inc.). All preimmune (PI-1 and PI-2) and immune (anti-TEX14-1 and anti-TEX14-2) IgG preparations were adjusted to ∼2 μm by protein assay (microBCA, Pierce Inc.) and Coomassie staining (GelCode Blue, Pierce Inc.) on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Commercial sources of purified, rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Inc. and Research Diagnostics, Inc.) served as standard to determine IgG concentrations.RESULTSRat germ cells that bind to laminin are highly enriched in type A spermatogonia (>90%) and spermatogonial stem cells (10Hamra F.K.

The laminin selection results in greater than 24-fold more DAZL+ spermatogenic colonies formed/10,000 cells plated than unfractionated testis cells after 9 days in culture on SNL fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S2A).

Experiments show that melt inclusions subjected to a thermal gradient migrate through olivine crystals, under the kinetic control of crystal-melt interface mechanisms. Exsolved gas bubbles remain fixed and eventually separate from the melt. Scaled to thermal gradients in Earth's mantle and geological times, our results account for the grain-scale segregation of primitive melts, reinterpret CO 2 -rich fluid inclusions as escaped from melt, and question the existence of a free, deeply percolating fluid phase.

https://openalex.org/W1969237253,"Certain viral and cellular mRNAs initiate translation cap-independently at internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements. Picornavirus IRES elements are widely used in dicistronic or multicistronic vectors in gene therapy, virus replicon systems, and analysis of IRES function. In such vectors, expression of the upstream gene often serves as internal control to standardize the readings of IRES-driven downstream reporter activity. Picornaviral IRES elements translate optimally at up to 120 mm K+ concentration, whereas genes used as upstream reporters usually have lower salt optima when present in monocistronic mRNAs. However, here we show that such reporter genes are efficiently translated at higher K+ concentrations when placed upstream of a functional picornavirus IRES. This translation enhancement occurs in cis, is independent of the nature of the first reporter and of second reporter translation, and is conferred by the IRESs of picornaviruses but not of hepatitis C virus. A defective picornavirus IRES with a deletion killing IRES activity but leaving the binding site for initiation factor eIF4G intact retains translation enhancement activity. Translation enhancement on a capped mRNA is disabled by m7GDP. In addition, the C-terminal fragment of eIF4G can confer translation enhancement also on uncapped mRNA. We conclude that whenever eIF4F has been captured to a dicistronic mRNA by binding to a picornavirus IRES via its eIF4G moiety, it can be provided in cis to the 5′-end of the RNA and there stimulate translation initiation, either by binding to the cap nucleotide using its eIF4E moiety or by binding to the RNA cap-independently using its eIF4G moiety.

Such IRES elements were first discovered in picornaviruses like encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (3Jang S.K. Kräusslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), poliovirus (4Pelletier J. Sonenberg N.

Virol. 1992; 66: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of several cellular mRNAs is driven by IRES elements (2Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The picornaviral IRES elements are classified in three groups according to their sequences and secondary structures, the type I elements of the entero-/rhinovirus group (including poliovirus), the type II elements of the cardio-/aphthovirus group (including EMCV and FMDV), and the type III element of hepatitis A virus (1Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). After infection of a susceptible cell, these IRES elements guide the small ribosomal subunit to an AUG triplet in a starting window at the 3′-border of the IRES (1Jackson R.J. Kaminski A.

Acta Virol. 2003; 47: 65-72PubMed Google Scholar). Using dicistronic mRNA systems for analyzing the activity of mutant IRES elements of FMDV (16Bassili G. Tzima E. Song Y. Saleh L. Ochs K. Niepmann M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2555-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and poliovirus, we made a surprising observation: the first reporter gene in such dicistronic mRNAs was very actively translated also at high salt concentrations in the presence of a functional downstream IRES, although the same reporter gene was translated with poor efficiency at high salt concentrations when placed in a monocistronic mRNA. Investigating this effect in detail, we show in this study that a functional picornavirus IRES in a dicistronic mRNA may support the activity not only of the downstream but also of the upstream reporter gene at high salt concentrations in cis. Analysis of different experimental parameters influencing this effect shows that the enhanced availability of the initiation factor eIF4F provided by a functional picornavirus IRES on the same RNA molecule in cis causes this translation enhancement effect. This effect may have important implications mainly for the investigation of the effect of mutations on translation and viral RNA replication in dicistronic replicon systems as well as on the analysis of IRES function on its own. Plasmids—The dicistronic expression vector pCAT-FM was renamed for clarity from pD12 (13Ochs K. Rust R.C. Niepmann M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7505-7514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contains downstream of an SP6 polymerase promoter the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and the FMDV IRES with the 11th AUG of FMDV fused to the firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene, followed by SV40 tAg splice and p(A) signals to allow efficient processing of transcripts after transfection. Plasmids pCAT-FM-up-CG and pCAT-FM-up-4 are pD12 derivatives described previously (16Bassili G. Tzima E. Song Y. Saleh L. Ochs K. Niepmann M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2555-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). pCAT-FM-d3 was derived from pD12 by exactly deleting FMDV IRES stem-loop 3 sequences. pFM is renamed from pM12 (13Ochs K. Rust R.C. Niepmann M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7505-7514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for clarity; it contains the FMDV IRES and the firefly luciferase gene. pMPolio (17Ochs K. Saleh L. Bassili G. Sonntag V.H. Zeller A. Niepmann M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2113-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) contains downstream of an SP6 polymerase promoter the complete poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) 5′-UTR sequence with the authentic initiator AUG fused to the Fluc coding sequence. For construction of pRL-FM-wt, pRL-FM-up-CG, and pRL-FM-up-4, the CAT reporter gene was removed from the respective pCAT-FM-plasmid, and the T7 polymerase promoter sequence together with the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene from phRL-null (Promega) were inserted. For construction of the dicistronic expression vector pRL-PV-wt, the Rluc gene from phRL-null was inserted upstream of the poliovirus IRES in pMPolio. pRL-PV-S.3 and pRL-PV-ΔV were generated by replacing the wild-type poliovirus IRES in pRL-PV-wt by the mutated poliovirus IRES elements from plasmids pMPolio-S3 and pMPolio-ΔV (18Ochs K.

For construction of pCAT-PV-wt, the CAT gene from pCAT-FM was ligated into pRL-PV-wt, replacing the Rluc gene. pCAT-PV-S.3 and pCAT-PV-ΔV were generated by replacing the wt poliovirus IRES in pCAT-PV-wt by the mutated poliovirus IRES from plasmids pMPolio-S3 and pMPolio-ΔV (18Ochs K.

In Vitro Transcription—Plasmids were usually linearized downstream of the Fluc gene. RNAs were synthesized in vitro at 37 °C for 60 min by using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase, respectively. For synthesis of capped RNAs, the rGTP concentration was reduced to 50 μm, and m7GpppG cap analogue (Roche Applied Science) was added to a concentration of 500 μm. The capped RNA was purified by precipitation with 2.5 m ammonium acetate, polyadenylated using poly(A) polymerase (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH), and again purified by precipitation with 2.5 m ammonium acetate. RNA for translation of FMDV L protease was transcribed from pFMDV14 (15Saleh L. Rust R.C. Füllkrug R. Beck E. Bassili G. Ochs K. Niepmann M. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The concentrations of all transcripts were determined photometrically and by agarose gel electrophoresis. In Vitro Translation—Translation reactions were performed in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL; Promega) or in non-nuclease-treated cytoplasmic HeLa extract (41Bergamini G. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. RNA. 2000; 6: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). 10-μl reactions usually contained 200 ng of RNA and 4.4 μl of extract. For labeling of proteins, 0.2 μl of [35S]methionine (15 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) was included. The RRL contained 113 mm of endogenous K+-acetate added by the supplier. To the translation reactions, KCl was supplemented to total concentrations of up to 160 mm as indicated. m7GDP or GDP was supplemented to 100 μm were indicated. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gels were analyzed by autoradiography. The gels were checked for equal sample loading if appropriate. m7GDP, a eIF4E inhibitor, was used at 100 μm concentration. Hippuristanol, an inhibitor of eIF4F activity, was kindly provided by J. Tanaka and J. Pelletier (42Bordeleau M.E. Mori A. Oberer M. Lindqvist L. Chard L.S. Higa T. Belsham G.J. Wagner G. Tanaka J. Pelletier J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and used at 10 μm concentration. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and BHK21 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, l-glucose (4500 mg/liter), l-glutamine, and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin and were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. RNA transfections were performed with the Transmessenger reagent (Qiagen) according to protocols provided by the supplier. Luciferase Assays—Renilla and firefly luciferase (Promega) as well as β-galactosidase reporter activity (Roche Applied Science) activities were determined essentially according to protocols provided by the reagent suppliers. Activities of reporter expression were usually measured 4 h after transfection. Western Blots–eIF4G and its C-terminal cleavage products were detected using an anti-eIF4G antiserum (BD Transduction Laboratories) that recognizes the C terminus of eIF4G (15Saleh L. Rust R.C. Füllkrug R. Beck E. Bassili G. Ochs K. Niepmann M. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Northern Blots—RNAs were detected with a 32P-labeled RNA probe complementary to the 3′-region of the firefly luciferase gene (43Song Y. Friebe P. Tzima E. Jünemann C. Bartenschlager R. Niepmann M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11579-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using standard procedures. Dicistronic mRNAs are widely used in IRES research to monitor the activity of an IRES or its mutant variants. In such experiments, the efficiency of translation of the second reporter gene, which is located downstream of the IRES, serves as a measure for the biologic activity of the IRES. At the same time, expression of the upstream first reporter gene of the dicistronic mRNA is usually used as an internal standard to level out differences between the different reactions of a given experiment that are due to slight variations in cell density, transfection efficiency, and other parameters of the experiment in question. A Picornavirus IRES Can Enhance Translation of an Upstream Reporter Gene at Physiological Salt Concentrations–In the course of experiments designed to analyze the effects of mutations in the eIF4G-binding site in the FMDV IRES (16Bassili G. Tzima E. Song Y. Saleh L. Ochs K. Niepmann M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2555-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we made a surprising observation when we used dicistronic mRNAs (Fig. 1A) to compare the translation efficiency of the up-4 mutant IRES (Fig. 1B) with wild-type IRES activity in the translation-competent RRL. These dicistronic mRNAs contain CAT as first reporter, the FMDV IRES, and the firefly luciferase (Fluc) as second, IRES-dependent reporter. At a potassium concentration of 50 mm, Fluc expression was significantly decreased with the IRES mutant up-4, whereas expression of the first reporter CAT was essentially unchanged and could be regarded as an internal standard (Fig. 1, C, compare lane 2 with lane 1, and D, 50 mm, black bars). When the same dicistronic mRNAs were translated in the presence of 120 mm K+, which is actually close to the physiological K+ concentration in living cells, we observed that the expression of the IRES-dependent Fluc protein was seriously impaired with the up-4 mutant IRES as expected (16Bassili G. Tzima E. Song Y. Saleh L. Ochs K. Niepmann M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2555-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, to our surprise also the level of CAT expression from the dicistronic mRNA containing the mutant IRES was much lower than CAT expression from the mRNA with the wild-type IRES (Fig. 1, C, compare lane 4 with lane 3, and D). Northern blots (Fig. 1E) show that the differences in expression were not due to differences in RNA amounts or stability. Thus, the presence of an active IRES in the dicistronic mRNA not only drives expression of the downstream reporter gene (which is regarded as a measure for IRES activity) but also positively influences first reporter expression, which is inefficient at elevated salt concentrations in the absence of an functional IRES (see also below). In the following, we performed a series of experiments to answer these questions: (i) Does the translation enhancement depend on the biological activity of the IRES or just on IRES RNA structure? (ii) Is the translation enhancement dependent on the type of picornavirus IRES? (iii) Does the effect depend on a special feature of a particular first reporter gene? (iv) Does the translation enhancement occur preferentially in cis on the same molecule of RNA or does it also occur in trans between different RNA molecules? (v) Is a second reporter gene translation required? (vi) Which factors may be involved in the translation enhancement? A Functional IRES Is Required for Translation Enhancement–To answer the above questions, we first analyzed the translation efficiency of the CAT first reporter gene contained in the dicistronic RNA at different K+ concentrations in comparison with the CAT gene contained in a monocistronic mRNA (Fig. 2A). With the dicistronic mRNA bearing the FMDV IRES, IRES-dependent Fluc expression was very efficient up to K+ concentrations of 120 mm, still significantly efficient at 130–140 mm but inefficient only above 140 mm (Fig. 2B). Expression of the CAT gene contained in the same mRNA was efficient up to K+ concentrations of 120 mm but declined at K+ concentrations of 130 mm or more. To check equal sample loading, the gels were Coomassie-stained prior to x-ray film exposure (not shown), and experiments performed with different RNA concentrations revealed that the effect was not concentration-dependent (not shown). In contrast, expression of the CAT gene from a monocistronic mRNA (Fig. 2D) showed a sharp decline at K+ concentrations above 70 mm and was nearly undetectable at K+ concentrations of 100 mm or higher. Thus, CAT first reporter translation was enhanced significantly in the presence of the downstream FMDV IRES at elevated salt concentrations. The Translation Enhancement Is Independent of the Type of Picornavirus IRES—To find out whether the observed translation enhancement is an effect special to a certain IRES structure, we used the poliovirus IRES instead of the FMDV IRES in a dicistronic mRNA. In this case, the expression of Fluc driven by the poliovirus IRES was not as efficient at higher salt concentrations (Fig. 2C) as with the FMDV IRES, consistent with the finding that the poliovirus IRES has a salt optimum for translation at about 80 mm K+ instead of the 120 mm K+ optimal for FMDV IRES activity in vitro (36Borman A.M. Bailly J.L. Girard M. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3656-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, also with the poliovirus IRES, first reporter CAT expression was significantly more efficient in the range of 80–100 mm K+ (Fig. 2C) compared with CAT expressed from the monocistronic mRNA (Fig. 2D). In conclusion, the enhancement of first reporter gene translation in a dicistronic mRNA depends on the presence of a functional IRES rather than on any particular RNA sequences or secondary structures unique to a certain IRES element. The Translation Enhancement Is Independent of the Nature of the First Reporter Gene—When we exchanged the first reporter gene CAT for the unrelated Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene (for the constructs, see Fig. 2E), we found that Rluc expression at elevated K+ concentrations was stronger in the presence of the poliovirus IRES in the same mRNA (Fig. 2G) compared with Rluc present only in a monocistronic mRNA (Fig. 2H) and even stronger in the presence of the FMDV IRES (e.g. compare lane 6 in Fig. 2, F–H). Thus, the enhancement of the efficiency of translation of the first reporter gene in a dicistronic mRNA is independent of the nature of the first reporter gene. Translation in HeLa Extract—To confirm that the results obtained by in vitro translations using reticulocyte lysate reflect biologically relevant phenomena, we also used cytoplasmic HeLa extract, which allows translation in an environment close to normal cellular conditions (41Bergamini G. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. RNA. 2000; 6: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). With this extract, we observed that Renilla luciferase expression from a monocistronic mRNA slightly differs from the expression in RRL by showing maximal translation at higher salt concentrations. However, the overall efficiency of Rluc translation from the monocistronic mRNA was low. In contrast, when the Rluc gene was placed in the dicistronic mRNA together with the downstream FMDV IRES driving Fluc expression (pRL-FM RNA) (Fig. 3A), the expression of the first reporter Rluc was enhanced enormously in a range from 90 to 120 mm K+, thereby exhibiting a salt optimum at"

We show here for zebrafish that embryonic retinoid homeostasis essentially depends on the activity of a leci-thin:retinol acyltransferase (Lratb). During embryogenesis, lratb is expressed in mostly non-overlapping domains opposite to retinal dehydrogenase 2 (raldh2), the key enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis. Blocking retinyl ester formation by a targeted knock down of Lratb results in significantly increased retinoic acid levels, which lead to severe embryonic patterning defects. Thus, we provide evidence that a balanced competition between Lratb and Raldh2 for yolk vitamin A defines embryonic compartments either for retinyl ester or retinoic acid synthesis. This homeostatic mechanism dynamically adjusts embryonic retinoic acid levels for gene regulation, concomitantly sequestering excess yolk vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters for the establishment of larval vision later during development.

The biological importance of retinoids (vitamin A or all-trans retinol (ROL) 4The abbreviations used are: ROL, all-trans retinol; Raldh, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase; Lrat, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase; RA, retinoic acid; RAL, all-trans retinal; RE, retinyl esters; WISH, whole mount in situ hybridization; hpf, hours post-fertilization; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MO, morpholino oligonucleotide. 4The abbreviations used are: ROL, all-trans retinol; Raldh, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase; Lrat, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase; RA, retinoic acid; RAL, all-trans retinal; RE, retinyl esters; WISH, whole mount in situ hybridization; hpf, hours post-fertilization; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MO, morpholino oligonucleotide. and its derivatives) for vertebrate development has long been known, because both deprivation and exposure to excess retinoids cause major embryonic abnormalities. The ROL derivative all-trans retinoic acid (RA) is a hormonal signaling molecule that acts in developing and adult tissues (1Livrea M.A. Livrea M.A. Vitamin A and Retinoids, an Update of Biological Aspects and Clinical Applications. Birkhauser, Basel, Switzerland2000Crossref Google Scholar). RA regulates gene expression via heterodimeric nuclear receptors, the RA receptors and the retinoid X receptors (2Petkovich M. Brand N.J. Krust A. Chambon P. Nature. 1987; 330: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 3Giguere V. Ong E.S. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Both are ligand-dependent transcription factors belonging to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors (4Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar). RA is generated from maternal ROL via all-trans retinal (all-trans RAL) by a stepwise enzymatic oxidation. Hereby, the second oxidation step catalyzed by retinal dehydrogenases (Raldhs) is thought to be rate-limiting (5Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 6Zhao D. McCaffery P. Ivins K.J. Neve R.L. Hogan P. Chin W.W. Drager U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The first step in the turn-off mechanism of retinoid signaling is the catabolism of RA by a class of cyto-chrome P450 enzymes (Cyp26s) to more polar products, such as 4-hydroxy RA or 4-oxo RA (7White J.A. Guo Y.D. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilworth F.J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29922-29927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The catabolic control of RA levels via Cyp26s is not sufficient to explain all aspects of retinoid homeostasis, considering for example the key role of vitamin A in vision. In photoreceptors, ROL is required for the synthesis of 11-cis retinal (11-cis RAL), the chromophore of visual pigments (8Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 743-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), in much higher amounts than for RA synthesis in gene regulation. This quantitatively different requirement for ROL calls for a mechanism that maintains the homeostasis between RA and 11-cis RAL synthesis. To elucidate the underlying control mechanism of retinoid homeostasis, we used the zebrafish as a model. In this oviparous vertebrate, yolk retinoids must be proportioned during embryonic development to adequately support both these processes. We found that sequestration of retinyl esters (RE) is essential for retinoid homeostasis during embryonic development. We molecularly and functionally characterized two different lecithin:retinol acyltransferases (Lrats), Lrata and Lratb that convert ROL to its ester form. Lrata is exclusively expressed in light-sensitive organs such as the pineal gland and the developing eyes, indicating that this Lrat contributes to retinoid metabolism in light perception (visual cycle). By contrast, lratb was already expressed during embryonic stages. Most interestingly, the expression domains of lratb were mutually exclusive to those of raldh2, suggesting that embryonic compartments for either RE or RA production exist. Targeted gene knock down of the Lratb function resulted in highly decreased embryonic RE but increased RA levels leading to severe patterning defects. Thus, a competition of Lratb and Raldh2 for yolk ROL dynamically adjusts embryonic RA synthesis levels. This homeostatic control mechanism elegantly satisfies the different quantitative and temporal requirements for ROL in gene regulation and vision during zebrafish development. Cloning of lrata and lratb—For cloning lrat orthologues from zebrafish, we searched the data base and found two full-length cDNA sequences (GenBank™ accession codes BC095753 and BC090301) encoding proteins with high overall sequence identity to the mouse and human Lrat, respectively. We here termed the corresponding genes lrata and lratb. For cloning, we performed reverse transcription PCR with whole RNA preparations from 3-day post-fertilization larvae (lrata) and liver of adult zebrafish (lratb) and the oligonucleotide primers lrata-up ATGCTGGACTCGCTGACTTTTC and lrata-down ACCAGCCATCCACAAAATAAAGG for lrata and lratb-up ATGTTAGATTCTCTCTCCTTGC and lratb-down TCCAGCCATCCACAAGATG for lratb. The corresponding lrata and lratb cDNAs obtained were cloned into the vector pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen) and verified by sequence analyses. Construction of Drosophila S2 Schneider Cell Expression Vectors, Transient Transfection of S2 Cells, and Induction—For cloning of lrata the primers forward, 5′-TTACTAGTAAAATGGTGGACTCGCTGACTTT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCTCGAGACCAGCCATCCACAAAATAAA-3′, and lratb forward, 5′-TTACTAGTAAAATGGTAGATTCTCTCTCCTT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCTCGAGTCCAGCCATCCACAAGATGA-3′, were used. PCR products were cut with SpeI and XhoI and ligated into a likewise treated pMT-V5/HisA expression vector (Invitrogen. By this procedure both lrata and lratb were linked to the V5/HisA epitope of the expression vector. S2 cells were purchased from Invitrogen and grown in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks (Greiner Bio One). Cells were maintained at 28 °C. On the day prior to transfection, cells were seeded in 30-mm (1.5 × 106 cells/dish) culture dishes (Greiner). To ensure comparability, for each experiment a single pool of cells was used. Transient transfection with 2 μg of plasmid DNA was accomplished using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein expression was induced 24 h post-transfection by addition of 1 mm copper sul-fate. Assays were carried out 48 h post-transfection under dim red light (620 nm). For this purpose, the cell culture medium was replaced by 2 ml of fresh medium containing 5 μm ROL (Sigma). After 1 h of incubation time, the medium was discarded and cells were washed with 2 ml pf PBS. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min and subjected to HPLC analysis using HPLC system 1. Subcellular Localization of Zebrafish lratb in S2 Cells—S2 cells were seeded in 30-mm cell culture dishes on top of poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated coverslips. After 24 h of protein expression induction, coverslips were washed with PBS and removed from the dishes. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 min. Methanol was removed, and 4% paraformaldehyde was added for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) and blocked with PBSTM (PBST containing 1% skim milk powder, w/v) for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were incubated in PBSTM containing anti-V5 antibody (1:10,000) (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with PBSTM, and incubated in anti-mouse-Cy3 antibody (1:400) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylin-dole (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence signals were recorded on a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was carried out with a Leica TCS4D microscope. Fish Maintenance and Strains—Zebrafish (strain AB/TL) were bred and maintained under standard conditions at 28.5 °C (9Westerfield M. Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. 2.1 Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1994Google Scholar). Morphological features were used to determine the stage of the embryos in hours (hpf) or days post-fertilization (10Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W.

Embryos used for in situ hybridization experiments were raised in the presence of 200 μm 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit pigmentation. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) was performed as described (11Hauptmann G. Gerster T.

The RNA probes were generated with the Dig RNA or the fluorescein labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Injections of Morpholino Oligonucleotide and mRNA—For targeted knock down of the Lratb protein an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) (GeneTools, LLC) was used covering +1 to +25 of the lratb mRNA, 5′-ACAGCAAGGAGAGAGAATCTAACAT-3′. The MO was dissolved in 0.3× Danieau′s solution (1× Danieau is 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 58 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.6 mm Ca(NO3)2) to obtain a stock concentration of 1 mm (8.57 mg/ml). The stock solution was diluted to 1.7 mg/ml. The injected volume was ∼3 nl, corresponding to 5.1 ng of MO/egg. Rescue experiments were performed by co-injection of 5.1 ng of lratb MO and 12.7 ng of raldh2 MO (12Begemann G. Schilling T.F. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Ingham P.W. Development. 2001; 128: 3081-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional rescue experiments were performed with lratb mRNA. For this purpose the lratb cDNA was cloned into the vector pCS2+ and mRNA was synthesized in vitro using the mMESSAGEmMACHINE kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion Europe Ltd. UK). Rescue by co-injection of 30 pg of the lratb mRNA demonstrated the specificity of lratb MO. Retinoid Treatments of Embryos—Fish embryos (4 hpf) were treated with 10-6 m ROL, 10-6 m RAL, 10-7 m RA, and 10-7 m 4-oxo RA in egg water. Retinoids were prepared from a stock of 10-3 m ROL, 10-3 m all-trans RAL, 10-4 m RA, and 10-4 m 4-oxo RA in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (Sigma-Aldrich). As controls, siblings were treated with equivalent amounts of Me2SO alone. During treatment, embryos were kept under dim red light (620 nm). Retinoids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and 4-oxo RA was synthesized as previously described (21Moise A.R. Kuksa V. Blaner W.S. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27815-27825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HPLC Analysis of Retinoids of Zebrafish Embryo—For extraction of retinoids, staged zebrafish embryos were collected under dim red light (620 nm). For the determination of apolar retinoids, 200 μlof2 m NH2OH and 200 μl of 100% MetOH were added to the embryos (n = 50). After homogenization, retinoids were extracted and subjected to HPLC system 1 as previously described (22von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). For determination of RA levels, staged embryos (n = 100) were collected and homogenized in 350 μl of PBS buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 7.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 KH2PO4, pH 7.2) and 150 μl of ethanol. Then 750 μl of ethylacetate/methylacetate (8:1, v,v) were added. The probes were mixed and subjected to centrifugation for 1 min at 5000 × g at 24 °C. The supernatant was collected and transferred to a new reaction tube. Extraction of the aqueous phase was repeated. The collected supernatants were vacuum dried (Concentrator 5301, Eppendorf, Germany). The dried pellet was resolved in 100 μl of HPLC solvent. The HPLC solvent was n-hexane and ethylacetate (81:19, v,v) containing 12.5 μl of acetic acid/100 ml. HPLC system 2 consisted of a Hypersil 3-μm column (Knauer) and a Beckman System Gold (Beckman Instruments) equipped with a multidiode array model 166 (Beckman Instruments) with flow rate of 1 ml min-1. For quantification of the molar amounts of retinoids, peak integrals were scaled with defined amounts of reference substances from Sigma-Aldrich and were quantified using the 32 Karat software (Beckman Instruments). Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. Photography—Live embryos were photographed in egg water and stained whole mount embryos in 100% glycerol on a dissecting microscope (Leica MZ FLIII) with an Axiocam (Zeiss). RE and Lrat Exist in the Zebrafish Embryo—In zebrafish, yolk ROL is mainly required for the establishment of functional visual pigments and is recovered in the eyes in the form of RE and 11-cis RAL already at early larval stages (23Lampert J.M. Holzschuh J. Hessel S. Driever W. Vogt K. von Lintig J. Development. 2003; 130: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here we determined the metabolic fate of yolk ROL during embryogenesis. We found that RAL, the yolk storage form of ROL in this teleost (23Lampert J.M. Holzschuh J. Hessel S. Driever W. Vogt K. von Lintig J. Development. 2003; 130: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), is largely converted to RE already during early embryogenesis. These compounds are the storage and transport form of ROL but are also intermediates for the synthesis of the visual chromophore 11-cis RAL (24Bernstein P.S. Law W.C. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As development proceeds, the increase in RE is proportional to the decrease of yolk RAL (Fig. 1). Lrat is the main enzyme responsible for RE synthesis in mammals (25Ruiz A. Winston A. Lim Y.H. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Bok D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3834-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, we searched the data base for putative zebrafish lrat homologues and found two candidate expressed sequence tags. We used reverse transcription PCR to clone the corresponding genes from embryonic mRNA preparations and labeled these lrata and lratb.Onthe level of the deduced amino acid sequences, Lrata and Lratb share 59 and 58% identity with human LRAT and 63% identity with each other (Fig. 2). A putative C-terminal transmembrane domain and catalytic amino acid residues (His-163 and Cys-161) were conserved, which are structural features that have been shown to be crucial for human LRAT enzymatic activity (26Mondal M.S. Ruiz A. Hu J. Bok D. Rando R.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Lrat catalyzes a transfer of an acyl group from the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) to ROL, yielding RE (25Ruiz A. Winston A. Lim Y.H. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Bok D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3834-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). When we transiently expressed the putative Lratb homologue from zebrafish in Drosophila S2 cells and added ROL to the cell culture medium, cells expressing Lratb efficiently synthesized RE, whereas in nontransfected cells this ROL derivative was not detectable (Fig. 3, A–C). A similar result with respect to both the cellular localization and enzymatic activity was obtained upon transient expression of lrata in this cell culture system (data not shown).FIGURE 3Lratb expression in S2 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting (A) and by epi-fluorescence microscopy (B) upon immunostaining (red, Lratb; blue,4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); scale bar 10 μm).

Lrata mRNA was first detectable at 24 hpf in the pineal gland, a light-sensitive endocrine organ (Fig. 4). Then at 54 hpf, lrata was expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium of the developing eyes. These results show that Lrata contributes to ROL metabolism (visual cycle) in light-sensitive organs. By contrast, lratb expression already became detectable in early embryonic stages (Fig. 5). At 5 hpf (30% epiboly), this gene was expressed throughout the embryo (Fig. 5B). During gastrulation, the expression faded on the ventral side (Fig. 5C) and became restricted to the neural plate during late epiboly (Fig. 5, D–F). Additionally, the mesendoderm started to express lratb at this stage (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, lratb expression domains were opposite to those previously reported for raldh2 (12Begemann G. Schilling T.F. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Ingham P.W. Development. 2001; 128: 3081-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Grandel H. Lun K. Rauch G.J. Rhinn M. Piotrowski T. Houart C. Sordino P. Kuchler A.M. Schulte-Merker S. Geisler R. Holder N. Wilson S.W. Brand M. Development. 2002; 129: 2851-2865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes the key enzyme for RA formation (6Zhao D. McCaffery P. Ivins K.J. Neve R.L. Hogan P. Chin W.W. Drager U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown by double WISH, lratb and raldh2 were expressed in sharply defined, non-overlapping domains at these embryonic stages (Fig. 5, E and F). In the bud stage and early segmentation stages, expression of lratb was seen throughout the presumptive brain and in the posterior trunk (Fig. 5, G–I). Strongest expression was found in the hindbrain up to rhombomere 5, as defined by krox20 staining (Fig. 5G), and in the tail bud (Fig. 5H). During segmentation, lratb expression persisted in the hindbrain and in the tail bud (Fig. 5, J–M). Again, lratb expression domains were adjacent to those of raldh2 at these developmental stages (Fig. 5, J and M). In addition, migrating neural crest cells expressed this enzyme (Fig. 5K, arrowhead). At later embryonic stages, lratb expression persisted in the posterior hindbrain and migrating neural crest. Additionally, lratb expression was found in the anterior endoderm (Fig. 5, N–P). At 72 hpf, staining for lratb mRNA faded out (data not shown). The mostly non-overlapping expression domains for lratb and raldh2 throughout embryo-genesis suggested that they define embryonic compartments for either RE or RA synthesis.FIGURE 5Analysis of lratb expression during the first 2 days of development using WISH. lratb expression is first detectable at 30% epiboly in the whole embryo (A–C) and becomes restricted during epiboly to the presumptive neural ectoderm (D). E and F, at 100% epiboly lratb (in blue) is expressed in the neural plate and presumptive mesoderm adjacent to raldh2 (in red). G and I, at bud stage expression of lratb (blue) is detected in the neural tube up to rhombomere 5 as revealed by krox20 expression (r3 and r5 in red). H and I,a strong expression of lratb is seen in the tail bud and presomitic mesoderm. J and L, during segmentation neural expression of lratb becomes restricted to the posterior hindbrain and persists in the tail bud and presomitic mesoderm. J, raldh2 (in red) is expressed throughout the somites, whereas lratb (in blue)is only expressed in the dorsal and ventral part. K, migrating neural crest cells from rhombomere 4 express lratb (blue, arrowhead)(krox20 expression in red). M, double WISH for raldh2 (in red) and lratb (in blue) reveals complementary expression domains around the tail bud. N, double WISH for raldh2 (in red) and lratb (in blue) of 24-hpf embryo shows that lrat2 expression persisted in the posterior hindbrain and migrating neural crest. Additionally, anterior endodermal cell layers expressed lratb. Lateral (O) and dorsal (P) view of a 48-hpf embryo revealed that lratb persisted in the posterior hindbrain and anterior endoderm.

Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). After injection of the MO into eggs of the one-cell stage, we determined retinoid levels in 24-hpf embryos. In repeated experiments (n = 3, with 60 embryos each), we found that the MO treatment strongly reduced RE levels in morphants as compared with controls (Figs. 6 and 8G).FIGURE 8RA and RE levels in wild-type and morphant embyros.

To provide evidence that Lratb deficiency interferes with retinoid signaling, we analyzed the expression of relevant marker genes by mRNA WISH. Analysis of pax2.1, pax6.2, and otx2 mRNA expression showed that the presumptive retina and the mid-brain were reduced in size (Fig. 7, A, B, and D, respectively). We also found patterning defects throughout the hindbrain as visualized by staining for pax2.1, fgf8, and krox20 mRNA (Fig. 7, A, C, and E). Additionally, as revealed by double WISH for krox20 and myoD, the body axis of morphants was shortened (Fig. 7E). Moreover, morphants showed ectopic myoD mRNA expression in the presomitic mesoderm (Fig. 7F), and the fgf8 expression domain was anteriorly expanded in the tail bud (Fig. 7H). Furthermore, analysis of myoD expression revealed that the somites were enlarged and not oriented in a herringbone-like fashion but stuck out perpendicularly to the anteroposterior axis as already seen in living embryos (Fig. 7, G and I). Dorsal views of myoD-stained embryos additionally showed that the notochord was undulated (Fig. 7F), an observation that was confirmed by staining for sonic hedgehog (shh) (Fig. 7, J and K). Comparable patterning defects in the hindbrain, the neuronal tube, and in the somites have been reported both for embryos treated with exogenous RA (29Hamade A. Deries M. Begemann G. Bally-Cuif L. Genet C. Sabatier F. Bonnieu A. Cousin X. Dev. Biol. 2006; 289: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and mutants with impaired RA catabolism such as Cyp26a1-/- mice and giraffe/cyp26a1 zebrafish mutant (13Emoto Y. Wada H. Okamoto H.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Indeed, cyp26a1 mRNA expression was up-regulated in many embryonic tissues of the morphants, including the eyes, the paraxial mesoderm, and the tail bud (Fig. 7L). Because cyp26a1 mRNA expression is induced by RA (7White J.A. Guo Y.D. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilworth F.J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29922-29927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), this finding indicated that the morphants suffered from an excess of RA. To confirm this interpretation, we determined RA levels in 10- (bud stage) and 24-hpf embryos by HPLC analysis. Consistent with early embryonic lratb expression, RA levels were significantly increased in morphants at the bud stage, and this increase was still found at 24 hpf (Fig. 8, A–F). This finding directly showed that when RE formation via Lratb is abolished the embryos synthesize toxic amounts of RA that are incompatible with normal development.

The recombinant Escherichia coli-derived enzymes were shown previously to elongate exogenously supplied oligosaccharides of their cognate GAG (e.g. HA elongated by PmHAS). Here we show that oligosaccharides and polysaccharides of certain noncognate GAGs (including sulfated and iduronic acid-containing forms) are elongated by PmHAS (e.g. chondroitin elongated by PmHAS) or PmCS. Various acceptors were tested in assays where the synthase extended the molecule with either a single monosaccharide or a long chain (∼102-4 sugars). Certain GAGs were very poor acceptors in comparison to the cognate molecules, but elongated products were detected nonetheless. Overall, these findings suggest that for the interaction between the acceptor and the enzyme (a) the orientation of the hydroxyl at the C-4 position of the hexosamine is not critical, (b) the conformation of C-5 of the hexuronic acid (glucuronic versus iduronic) is not crucial, and (c) additional negative sulfate groups are well tolerated in certain cases, such as on C-6 of the hexosamine, but others, including C-4 sulfates, were not or were poorly tolerated. In vivo, the bacterial enzymes only process unsulfated polymers; thus it is not expected that the PmCS and PmHAS catalysts would exhibit such relative relaxed sugar specificity by acting on a variety of animal-derived sulfated or epimerized GAGs.

The backbones of the vertebrate GAGs, HA (-β1,4-GlcUA-β1,3-Glc-NAc-), chondroitin sulfate (-β1,4-GlcUA-β1,3-GalNAc-), heparan sulfate (α1,4-GlcUA-β1,4-GlcNAc-), heparin (-α1,4-IdoUA-α 1,4-GlcNAc-), and keratan sulfate (-β1,3-Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-), are sulfated except for HA. The bacterial GAG polymers are not known to be sulfated. The enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of all the GAG backbones, except for keratan, have been molecularly cloned.Certain bacterial enzymes, including the Gram-negative Pasteurella multocida type A hyaluronan synthase, PmHAS, and the type F chondroitin synthase, PmCS, are particularly amenable to study because of their two active center architecture (10Jing W.

The streptococcal and animal HA synthase enzymes, however, do not readily utilize exogenously supplied acceptors and are more difficult to study (13DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol.

The sugar nucleotide specificity of native sequence enzymes has been evaluated with naturally occurring UDP-sugar donors; only the authentic monosaccharide molecules are transferred efficiently by the native enzymes (e.g. C-4 epimers will not substitute).

Therefore, throughout the text all polysaccharides are defined with respect to their source and are given a simple nomenclature code (Table 1).TABLE 1Carbohydrate nomenclature, code and structure Due to the presence of multiple sulfation isomers within any one commercial chondroitin sulfate preparation (e.g. CSA and CSB, etc.), the simple identification code designates the animal source of polymer (the source is underlined). The manufacturer assay values are presented for polysaccharides. The oligosaccharide structures were verified by mass spectrometry and/or NMR. R indicates functional group on hexosamine.CodeOligosaccharide (source)StructureHA4Hyaluronan tetrasaccharide (S. zooepidemicus)(β1,3-GlcNAc-β1,4-GlcUA)2CSbt3Chondroitin 4-sulfate trisaccharide (bovine trachea)(GalNAc-4SO4)-β1,4-GlcUA-β1,3-(GalNAc-4SO4)CSs3Chondroitin 6-sulfate trisaccharide (shark cartilage)(GalNAc-6SO4)-β1,4-GlcUA-β1,3-(GalNAc-6SO4)CSs5Chondroitin 6-sulfate pentasaccharide (shark cartilage)(Cs3)-β1,4-GlcUA-β1,3-(GalNAc-6SO4)CSpII3C-5-epimerized chondroitin 4-sulfate trisaccharide (porcine intestinal mucosa, Prep II; Celsus)(GalNAc-4SO4)-β1,4-IdoUA-α1,3-(GalNAc-4SO4)CSpII5C-5-epimerized chondroitin 4-sulfate pentasaccharide (porcine intestinal mucosa, Prep II; Celsus)(CSpII3)-β1,4-IdoUA- α1,3-(GalNAc-4SO4)dCSpII3Desulfated C-5-epimerized chondroitin sulfate trisaccharide (porcine intestinal mucosa, Prep II; Celsus)GalNAc-β1,4-IdoUA-α1,3-GalNAcHep5Synthetic heparin pentasaccharide (Arixtra®)(GlcNR′-6OR)-α1,4-(GlcUA)-β1,4-(GlcNR′-3OR-6OR)-α1,4-(Ido UA-2OR)-α1,4-(GlcNR′-6OR)) methyl glycoside, where R, R′ = SO3He5Heparosan pentasaccharide (E. coli K5)GlcNAc-(α1,4-GlcUA-β1,4-GlcNAc)2CodePolysaccharide (source)StructureHAHyaluronic acid (S. zooepidemicus)(β1,3-GlcNAc-β1,4-GlcUA)∼200CUnsulfated chondroitin (Pasteurella type F)(β1,3-GalNAc-β1,4-GlcUA)∼40CSbtChondroitin sulfate (bovine trachea)(β1,3-(GalNAc-4SO4 or -6SO4)-β1,4-GlcUA)∼50, where 70% CSA = 4-SO4, 30% CSC = 6-SO4CSpIC-5-epimerized chondroitin sulfate (porcine intestinal mucosa, Prep I; Sigma)(β1,3-(GalNAc-4SO4)-α1,4-IdoUA)∼50, where 90% CSA = 4-SO4; ? % epimerizedCSpIIC-5-epimerized chondroitin 4-sulfate (porcine intestinal mucosa, Prep II; Celsus)(β1,3-(GalNAc-4SO4)-α1,4-IdoUA)∼60, ∼95% epimerizeddCSpIIDesulfated C-5-epimerized chondroitin sulfate (porcine intestinal mucosa, Prep II; Celsus)(β1,3-GalNAc-α1,4-IdoUA)∼25, ∼95% epimerizedCSsChondroitin sulfate (shark cartilage)(β1,3-(GalNAc-4SO4 or -6SO4)-β1,4-GlcUA)∼130, where 90% CSC = 6-SO4, 10% CSA = 4-SO4CSsfChondroitin sulfate (shark fin)((β1,3-GalNAc-6SO4)-(β1,4-GlcUA/IdoUA-2SO4))∼100 aThe major disaccharide unit of the polysaccharide.

Shark fin chondroitin sulfate (CSsf) (sold as “chondroitin sulfate D”) and squid cartilage chondroitin sulfate (CSq) (sold as “chondroitin sulfate E”) were obtained from Associates of Cape Cod/Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). In addition, a highly C-5 epimerized (>95% 4S-GalNAc-IdoUA repeats) chondroitin sulfate (CSpII; a high purity dermatan sulfate from porcine intestinal mucosa similar to CSpI above, but better characterized) and heparan sulfate (porcine intestinal mucosa) were obtained from Celsus Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH). Unsulfated chondroitin polysaccharide (C) and unsulfated heparosan polysaccharide was prepared from cultures of either type F or type D P. multocida, respectively (20DeAngelis P.L. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Mao W.J. Linhardt R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The degree of polymerization of the HA and the unsulfated chondroitin was reduced to ∼80 and ∼20 kDa, respectively, by autohydrolysis (121 °C, 20 p.s.i., 20 min) to be more comparable with the smaller molecular weight chondroitin sulfates (∼15-40 kDa) and heparin (∼17-19 kDa). In addition, 80-kDa monodisperse HA was prepared by synchronized stoichiometrically controlled chemoenzymatic reactions (12Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42345-42349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).To avoid the heterogeneity problem intrinsic to natural GAG polysaccharides, a series of defined oligosaccharides of known structure and length (Table 1) was prepared as described below and outlined in Table 2.TABLE 2Oligosaccharide derivative preparation strategy The various polysaccharides were cleaved by GAG digestive enzymes (HAase, testicular hyaluronidase; ABCase, chondroitin ABC lyase; HepIIIase, heparin lyase III) and/or desulfated by solvolysis.

The resulting oligosaccharide products were fractionated on a Bio-Gel P6 (Bio-Rad) column eluted with 100 mm sodium chloride. Sized oligosaccharides were then desalted by SEC on a Bio-Gel P2 column. Charge separation of the tetrasaccharide fraction was carried out by semi-preparative strong anion exchange-high performance liquid chromatography (SAX-HPLC) (21Yang H.O. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Kuberan B. Yu G. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The major peaks were pooled, lyophilized, and desalted on a Bio-Gel P2 column. The unsaturated chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharide containing two 4-O-sulfonated GlcNAc residues (1 mg) was dissolved in distilled water (1 mg/ml). To remove the nonreducing terminal unsaturated GlcUA residue, equal volumes of the oligosaccharide solution and mercuric acetate reagent (35 mm, adjusted to pH 5 using acetic acid in distilled water) were added and stirred for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then passed through a pre-washed Dowex 50W-X8 H+ column, neutralized with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and then applied to a Bio-Gel P2 column to obtain the pure trisaccharide CSb3. The structure of this trisaccharide was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis (Table 3) (21Yang H.O. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Kuberan B. Yu G. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J.

The resulting oligosaccharide products were fractionated on a Bio-Gel P6 column, and each oligosaccharide was desalted on a Bio-Gel P2 column. The unsaturated chondroitin tetrasaccharide (1 mg) and hexasaccharide (1 mg) were treated with mercuric acetate reagent as described earlier to obtain the trisaccharide CSs3 and pentasaccharide CSs5. The structures of these products were determined by ESI-MS analysis (Table 3).C-5-epimerized Chondroitin 4-Sulfate Trisaccharide and Pentasaccharide (CSpII3 and CSpII5)—C-5-epimerized chondroitin sulfate from porcine intestinal mucosa, CSpII (Celsus; 10 g), was treated with chondroitin ABC lyase (20 units) as above. The resulting oligosaccharide products were fractionated on a Bio-Gel P6 column, and each oligosaccharide was desalted by SEC on a Bio-Gel P2 column. Charge separation of sized oligosaccharide fractions was carried out by SAX-HPLC. The major peaks were pooled, lyophilized, and desalted on a Bio-Gel P2 column. The unsaturated C-5-epimerized chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharide (6 mg) and hexasaccharide (2 mg) were treated with mercuric acetate reagent to obtain the pure C-5-epimerized chondroitin sulfate trisaccharide, CSpII3, and pentasaccharide, CSpII5. The structures of these oligosaccharides were confirmed by 1H NMR and ESI-MS analysis (Table 3) (21Yang H.O. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Kuberan B. Yu G. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Desulfated C-5-epimerized Chondroitin Sulfate (dCSpII) Polysaccharide—The sodium salt of C-5-epimerized chondroitin sulfate (high purity dermatan sulfate from porcine intestinal mucosa; Celsus), CSpII (250 mg), was treated with 250 ml of acidic methanol (1.25 ml of acetyl chloride in 250 ml of methanol) for 3 days at room temperature. The recovered solid product (methyl ester of desulfated epimerized chondroitin sulfate) was treated with 10 ml of 0.1 m sodium hydroxide for 24 h at room temperature to obtain free carboxylate, O-desulfated epimerized chondroitin sulfate dCSpII (22Avci F.Y. Toida T. Linhardt R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This structure was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (23Sudo M. Sato K. Chaidedgumjorn A. Toyoda H. Toida T. Imanari T. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 297: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Desulfated C-5-epimerized Chondroitin Sulfate Trisaccharide (dCSpII3)—The dCSpII polymer (100 mg) was treated with chondroitin ABC lyase (1 unit) as described earlier. The resulting oligosaccharide products were fractionated on a Bio-Gel P6 column, and each oligosaccharide was desalted on a Bio-Gel P2 column. Charge separation of sized oligosaccharide fractions was carried out by SAX-HPLC. The major peaks were pooled, lyophilized, and desalted on a Bio-Gel P2 column. C-5-epimerized chondroitin tetrasaccharide without sulfate groups at Glc-NAc residues (1 mg) was treated with mercuric acetate reagent to obtain the trisaccharide. The structure of this trisaccharide was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis (Table 3).Synthetic Heparin Pentasaccharide (Hep5)—The synthetic analog of the anti-thrombin III binding pentasaccharide, fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra®), was obtained from the pharmacy. The contents of 10 syringes (25 mg in 5 ml of isotonic saline total) were collected and dialyzed (1000-Da cutoff) against water for 2 days at 4 °C and lyophilized to obtain the pentasaccharide Hep5 in quantitative yield.Heparosan Pentasaccharide (He5)—Heparosan polysaccharide was isolated from E. coli K5 and purified according to the published procedure (24Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Using heparin lyase III from Flavobacterium heparinum, a controlled partial depolymerization was performed. The oligosaccharide mixture was size-fractionated using a Bio-Gel P6 column. Each fraction was concentrated and desalted on a Bio-Gel P2 SEC column. The unsaturated hexasaccharide was treated with mercuric acetate reagent to obtain heparosan pentasaccharide He5. Analysis by ESI-MS confirmed the structure of this product (data not shown).Sugar Quantitation—All carbohydrates were assayed by carbazole method (25Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5132) Google Scholar) for uronic acid using GlcUA as a standard.Synthase Purification—The recombinant E. coli cells expressing the truncated, soluble dual-action catalysts PmHAS-(1-703) or PmCS-(46-695) were extracted with the permeabilization agent octylthioglucoside (1% w/v) in 1 m ethylene glycol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, containing protease inhibitors (14DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The extract was clarified by centrifugation and applied to a pseudoaffinity column (Tosoh Toyopearl AF-Red-650) equilibrated in the same buffer except 50 mm Hepes was substituted for Tris. The protein eluted with a NaCl gradient (0-1.5 m NaCl for 120 min), and the enzyme peak was determined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The pooled enzyme (∼95% pure PmHAS or PmCS) was concentrated with an ultrafiltration device (Amicon Ultra 15 ml, 50-kDa cutoff). The protein was quantitated by the Bradford assay with a bovine serum albumin standard (Pierce).Synthase Assays and Acceptor Utilization Tests—PmHAS or PmCS-catalyzed polymerization was measured with radiolabeled sugar incorporation assays. UDP-GlcUA and UDP-Hex-NAc polymerization was recorded by monitoring incorporation of UDP-[3H]GlcUA as denoted in Equation 1, acceptor+nUDP-[H3]GlcUA+nUDP-HexNAcâ†’2nUDP+([H3]GlcUA-HexNAc)n-acceptor(Eq. 1) Typically, 25-μl reactions containing ∼1 μg (∼13 pmol) of enzyme, PmHAS-(1-703) or PmCS-(46-695), and ∼0.01 nmol to 3.75 nmol of a given acceptor were employed. A “no acceptor” control was used for all analyses; this background value corresponding to de novo polymer initiation was subtracted from the value obtained from the assay with acceptor. Assays with an HA polymer acceptor were employed in every data set to allow for normalization. Polymerization reactions contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 m ethylene glycol, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.05 mm UDP-[3H]GlcUA (1 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.2 mm UDP-HexNAc (UDP-GlcNAc for PmHAS or UDP-Gal-NAc for PmCS) and were incubated at 30 °C for either 3 min (polysaccharide acceptors) or 30 min (oligosaccharide acceptors). Reactions were stopped by placing on ice and adding SDS (2% final w/v). Descending paper chromatography was used to separate the unincorporated radiolabel from the elongated acceptors (10Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The assays were performed in duplicate and were linear with respect to enzyme concentration and time; less than 5% UDP-sugar substrate was consumed.Single sugar additions were also monitored by reverse phase HPLC ESI-MS (26Thanawiroon C. Linhardt R.J. J. Chromatogr. A. 2003; 1014: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, similar reaction conditions were utilized as described above, except only single unlabeled UDP-sugar (2-6 mm final) was employed. The enzyme adds a monosaccharide unit onto the nonreducing end of various acceptors as shown in Equation 2 or 3. acceptor+UDP-GlcUA→UDP+(GlcUA-acceptor)(Eq. 2) acceptor+UDP-HexNAc→UDP+(HexNAc-acceptor)(Eq. 3) Chimeric GAG Synthesis—The purified enzymes PmHAS-(1-703) or PmCS-(46-695) (∼1 μg) were used to add unlabeled HA or chondroitin chains, respectively, to various GAG polysaccharide acceptors (∼8-225 μg). Reactions (25 μl) contained the same reaction buffer as above except that 2-4 mm UDP-GlcUA and 2-4 mm UDP-HexNAc (UDP-GlcNAc for PmHAS or UDP-GalNAc for PmCS) were utilized at 30 °C for varying times (see Equation 1, but without the 3H label).Size Analysis of Polysaccharides—Polymers were analyzed using 1-1.2% 1× TAE-agarose gels (30 V, 5 h, Stains-All detection) (27Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The specific Streptomyces hyaluronate lyase from Sigma was employed to destroy and thus identify authentic HA chains. Defined HA molecular weight standards were from (Hyalose L.L.C., Oklahoma City, OK) (12Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42345-42349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Kilobase DNA standards were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).Analytical high performance SEC was performed with PLaquagel-OH 60, -OH 50, -OH 40 columns in tandem (15 μm, 7.5 × 300 mm, Polymer Laboratories Amherst, MA) eluted with 50 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7, at 0.4-0.5 ml/min. Multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) detection was performed to quantify absolute molecular weights (12Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42345-42349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe finding that recombinant PmHAS, and later PmCS, was able to elongate certain small oligosaccharides, including HA4 and chondroitin sulfate hexasaccharides, respectively (13DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19DeAngelis P.L. Padgett-McCue A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24124-24129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), led to a broader investigation of the potential range of acceptor usage (Tables 4 and 5). In contrast, the other distinct bacterial HA synthase enzymes from group A and C Streptococcus cannot be tested at this time because of their inability to elongate exogenously added acceptors.TABLE 4PmHAS and PmCS polysaccharide acceptor specificity Polymerization assays with each acceptor (at least three experiments in duplicate) were performed. The value of no acceptor control (∼300 – 600 dpm) was subtracted from each point. The averaged values for PmHAS or PmCS are presented. The ratio (nanomoles of test acceptor/nmol of HA standard) was employed to normalize to the HA signal (30,000 dpm for 0.02 nmol of HA), which was set to 100%. For all results, * = p < 0.05 and ** = p < 0.01 in a Student's one-tailed t test for comparison of a given test acceptor to the no acceptor control assay. ND indicates not determined. Both enzymes may utilize either HA or chondroitin polymers,"
https://openalex.org/W2083971370,"Circadian clocks are self-sustained biochemical oscillators. The oscillator of cyanobacteria comprises the products of three kai genes (kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC). The autophosphorylation cycle of KaiC oscillates robustly in the cell with a 24-h period and is essential for the basic timing of the cyanobacterial circadian clock. Recently, period extender (pex), mutants of which show a short period phenotype, was classified as a resetting-related gene. In fact, pex mRNA and the pex protein (Pex) increase during the dark period, and a pex mutant subjected to diurnal light-dark cycles shows a 3-h advance in rhythm phase. Here, we report the x-ray crystallographic analysis and biochemical characterization of Pex from cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The molecule has an (α + β) structure with a winged-helix motif and is indicated to function as a dimer. The subunit arrangement in the dimer is unique and has not been seen in other winged-helix proteins. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay using a 25-base pair complementary oligonucleotide incorporating the kaiA upstream sequence demonstrates that Pex has an affinity for the double-stranded DNA. Furthermore, mutation analysis shows that Pex uses the wing region to recognize the DNA. The in vivo rhythm assay of Pex shows that the constitutive expression of the pex gene harboring the mutation that fails to bind to DNA lacks the period-prolongation activity in the pex-deficient Synechococcus, suggesting that Pex is a DNA-binding transcription factor.

Organisms from cyanobacteria to mammals have a circadian rhythm, an adaptation to diurnal environmental changes such as light and temperature. The timing machinery of the rhythm is known as the “circadian clock” (1Bünning E. The Physiological Clock. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1973Google Scholar, 2Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. DeCoursey P.J. Chronobiology: Biological Timekeeping. Sinauer Associates Inc.,, Sunderland, MA2004Google Scholar). The clock has three representative properties (free running, resetting, and temperature compensation), which are essential to a system of time measurement. In cyanobacteria, circadian rhythms have been reported in amino acid uptake (3Chen T. Chen T.L. Hung L.M. Hung T.C.

After a photosynthesis gene (psbAI) in a unicellular strain, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, was shown to be transcribed rhythmically with a circadian period under constant conditions (9Kondo T.

Transcription of either the kaiA or kaiBC operon is under circadian feedback regulation, whereby the kaiA and kaiC proteins (KaiA and KaiC) activate and repress the promoter of kaiBC (11Ishiura M.

KaiC has autokinase activity essential to the rhythm, where the kinase reaction is accelerated and decelerated by KaiA and kaiB protein (KaiB), respectively (13Nishiwaki T. Satomi Y. Nakajima M.

This observation indicates that various heteromultimeric complexes of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC are formed in the cell (15Kitayama Y. Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kondo T.

Resetting-related mutants have been isolated and found to lack normal circadian resetting. Period extender (pex), mutants of which show a short-period phenotype (22Kutsuna S. Kondo T. Aoki S. Ishiura M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was recently classified as a resetting-related gene (23Takai N. Ikeuchi S. Manabe K. Kutsuna S. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2006; 21: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Insertion of pex into the genome of the clock mutant C22a (which has a kaiA1 mutation) causes extension of the 22-h period phenotype of C22a to 24 h, similar to that of the wild type (10Kondo T.

Levels of pex mRNA and pex protein (Pex) increase in the dark period, and a pex mutant subjected to diurnal light-dark cycles shows an advance in the phase of the rhythm by 3 h, suggesting that Pex has a resetting function (23Takai N. Ikeuchi S. Manabe K. Kutsuna S. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2006; 21: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis demonstrates that Pex has a PadR domain, which is conserved among PadR proteins in lactobacilli Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus plantarum (24Barthelmebs L. Lecomte B. Divies C. Cavin J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6724-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PadR is a transcriptional regulator related to multiple antibiotic resistance repressor (MarR) 3The abbreviations used are: MarR, multiple antibiotic resistance repressor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; SeMet, selenomethionine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RTP, replication terminator protein. family proteins with DNA-binding activity (25Nikaido H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 5: 516-523Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and binds to the promoter of the padA gene, which is essential for metabolizing environmental toxins such as p-coumaric acid. Despite these structural indications, however, no experimental evidence has been obtained regarding the function of Pex. To understand the molecular mechanism involved in regulating the circadian clock oscillation in cyanobacteria, we have determined the crystal structure of a N-terminal deletion mutant of Pex, Pex-(15–148), from S. elongatus PCC 7942 at 1.8-Å resolution by x-ray diffraction. To our knowledge, this is the first structure determination of a protein of the circadian input system in the cyanobacteria circadian clock. Pex-(15–148) has a winged-helix motif and is likely to function as a dimer with a unique subunit arrangement. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) and mutation analysis demonstrate that Pex has specific affinity for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) containing the kaiA upstream site and that the wing region in the winged-helix motif has a crucial role in interaction with the DNA. Protein Expression and Purification—Genes encoding full-length Pex, Pex-(1–148), and its N-terminal deletion mutants (Pex-(15–148) and selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled Pex-(15–148)) were subcloned into expression vector pGEX6P-1 (GE Healthcare) at the 5′ BamHI-XhoI site, and expressed as fusion proteins of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for Pex-(1–148) and Pex-(15–148), and in E. coli strain B834(DE3) for SeMet-labeled Pex-(15–148). The cells were grown at 37 °C to a cell density of 0.4–0.6 at 660 nm and incubated for a further 5 h after the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C. Pex-(1–148), Pex-(15–148), and SeMet-labeled Pex-(15–148) were purified under the same experimental conditions. The cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by sonication at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a GST affinity column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GS4B) (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-free lysis buffer. The adsorbed fraction was eluted with elution buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 30 mm reduced glutathione). The fusion protein was cleaved by 100 units of PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) for 40 h at 4 °C. The cleaved protein was applied to an affinity HiTrap heparin column (GE Healthcare), equipped with anÁKTA Prime system (GE Healthcare) equilibrated at 4 °C with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The adsorbed fraction was eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Homogeneity of the purified protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Purified protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA was concentrated at 4 °C to ∼4 mg/ml in a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon). The concentration of the purified protein was determined by UV absorption. Crystallization and Data Collection—Pex-(15–148) was successfully crystallized at 20 °C by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method using 0.5–1.0 m Li2SO4 as a precipitant in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.8–4.6) containing 50 mm magnesium acetate. Crystals of SeMet-labeled Pex-(15–148) were obtained under the same conditions. All x-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline BL-5 at Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan, using an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector. Before the x-ray experiments, crystals of Pex-(15–148) and SeMet-labeled Pex-(15–148) were each soaked in the crystallization buffer containing 20% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were processed with HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) and Phaser (28Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). This is attributable to significantly large differences in the ternary structures between Pex-(15–148) and the search models. The structure of Pex-(15–148) was therefore solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction using the SeMet-labeled Pex-(15–148) crystal. Experimental phases were calculated up to 2.0-Å resolution with SOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) and improved by solvent-flattening with RESOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). An initial model was build by ARP/WARP (30Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Int. Tables Crystallogr. 2001; F: 720-722Google Scholar), followed by O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and refined with CNS (32Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

After several cycles of rebuilding with program O and refinement with CNS and REFMAC5 (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), the model finally converged, resulting in a crystallographic R value of 19.6% and a free R value of 23.4% for all diffraction data up to 1.8-Å resolution. The Ramachandran plot of the final model, containing 222 amino acid residues, 144 water molecules, and 2 SO42- ions, shows that all of the amino acid residues have good stereochemistry, with 95.0% of residues in the most favorable regions and 5.0% in additional allowed regions defined by the program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 282-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The figures were generated by PyMol (35DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Coordinates for Pex-(15–148) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (Protein Data Bank code 2E1N). Site-directed Mutagenesis and EMSA—Alanine mutants of Pex-(1–148), Y82A, T83A, K86A, D90A, R104A, R106A, and R108A, were prepared using pGEX6P-1 wild-type Pex-(1–148) as a template with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutants were expressed as fusion proteins of GST from a pGEX6P-1 vector in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and purified by the same protocol used for wild-type Pex-(15–148), except that a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) was used instead of the HiTrap heparin column. The DNA binding capacities of wild-type and mutant Pex were examined by EMSA using a 25-bp complementary oligo-nucleotide containing the kaiA upstream sequence including the -60 to -36 region (kaiA upstream site), 5′-ATTTTTCCTTTGTCCAGAGATTAAT-3′ (as the 1st codon of kaiA is +1), which was purchased from Invitrogen. The dsDNA was prepared by annealing at a 1:1 molar ratio in 0.1 m KCl solution. Each solution (5 μl) containing 5 pmol of DNA oligomer (1 μm final concentration) and a 1.5-fold excess of each of wild-type and mutant Pex was separated by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for 90 min. The running solution was 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 20 mm acetic acid and 1 mm EDTA. The shifted bands stained by ethidium bromide in the gel were detected by an Image Analyzer (TOYOBO FAS-III). We also purchased the 25-bp DNAs of a 5-nucleotide downstream sequence (kaiA-1) and 21-nucleotide upstream sequence (kaiA-2)ofthe kaiA upstream site (5′-TCCTTTGTCCAGAGATTAATCTGTC-3′; kaiA-1,5′-TGCAGTGCTAGGCTAAATTAAATTT-3′; kaiA-2) and CmpR binding site in the psbAII promoter region (psbAII) (40 bp, 5′-AGTCCTTAGTTGAACTATTTACGAGACTTAATAGCCTCGT-3′) (45Takahashi Y. Yamaguchi O. Omata T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In Vivo Rhythm Assay—The bioluminescence reporter S. elongatus PCC 7942 cell NUC42 was used as wild-type, in which a gene fusion of a kaiBC promoter and a gene set of bacterial luciferase, luxAB, was recombined into a genomic region, neutral site I (12Kutsuna S. Nakahira Y. Katayama M. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1478-1484Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The pex-deficient mutant cell, YCC19, derived from the kaiBC reporter was used (23Takai N. Ikeuchi S. Manabe K. Kutsuna S. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2006; 21: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The pex-deficient mutant harboring the pex with an E. coli inducible promoter, Ptrc, in the genomic region neutral site II was used as the constitutive induction cell of pex. Then, we constructed the plasmid by which Pex(R106A) protein was expressed with Ptrc inducible promoter. At first we amplified the DNA fragment of the pex gene with base pair substitutions at the 106th codon for Arg to Ala by PCR with KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO). The amplified pex DNA was digested with the BamHI restriction enzyme and inserted into unique BamHI site downstream of the Ptrc promoter in the pTS2KPtrc plasmid. The obtained plasmid was checked by sequencing and then introduced into YCC19. These cyanobacterial cells were cultivated on BG-11 agar medium containing 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside under continuous light until the colonies with 0.2 mm in diameter appeared. After resetting of the clock by treatment of 12-h darkness, a lid of a microcentrifuge tube containing 30 μl of vacuum pump oil with 3% bioluminescence substrate (n-decanal; Wako) was placed on the agar medium with the colonies. Then, bioluminescence were monitored under continuous light at 30 °C using an automated system equipped with photon-multiplier tubes, as previously described (11Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Western Blotting Analysis—About 5000 of the Synechococcus colonies of each cell were formed on BG-11 agar medium containing 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 days in a continuous light condition. Then those colonies were subjected to 12 h dark. The wild-type and pex-deficient mutant colonies subjected to 6 h dark were collected with a spreader. After the 12-h dark treatment, colonies were illuminated for 6 h, then, collected. The cell pellet was suspended in 200 μlof Tris-buffered saline and sonicated to extract soluble protein as described previously (23Takai N. Ikeuchi S. Manabe K. Kutsuna S. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2006; 21: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cell extract containing 18 μgof total protein was electrophoresed through a 20% SDS-acrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween (0.3%; PBS-T) for 1 h. The anti-GST-Pex antiserum was diluted 100-fold in PBS-T and used as primary antibody for 1 h. After washing the membrane in PBS-T, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit Ig was diluted in PBS-T (1/1000) and used as the secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). These procedures were performed at room temperature except the blotting at 5 °C. The chemiluminescence substrate was Immun-Star HRP Luminol/Enhancer, used with the Fluor-S MultiImager chemiluminescence imaging system (Bio-Rad). Crystal Structure—The crystal structure of Pex-(15–148) from cyanobacterium S. elongatus PCC 7942 was successfully solved by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method and refined at 1.8-Å resolution. The molecule has an (α + β) structure, which forms a winged-helix motif together with two additional α helices in the N-terminal (α0 helix, residues 25–33) and C-terminal (α4 helix, residues 120–131) regions (Fig. 1A). The winged-helix motif consists of helices α1 (residues 42–53), α2 (residues 60–70), and α3 (residues 78–90), strands β1 (residues 94–99) and β2 (residues 108–113), and the wing region that connects strands β1 and β2. The amino acid sequence of the molecule, together with assignments of the secondary structure elements, is shown in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of cyanobacterial Pex proteins. Residues conserved among the three proteins are shown on a black background. The secondary structure elements, α-helices (bars) and β-strands (arrows), and disordered regions (broken lines) of Pex (15–148) from S. elongatus (molecule B) are indicated above the alignment and colored as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Asterisks indicate the mutation sites used for EMSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two molecules (molecules A and B), which are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, are present in the crystal asymmetric unit (Fig. 3A). They have essentially the same structure with root mean square deviations of 1.1 Å for Cα atoms from residues 23 to 132. Residues 15–22 and 133–148 in molecule A and residues 15–22 and 135–148 in molecule B were disordered. Molecule A is in close contact with molecule B, forming a dimer in the crystal. The contact is hydrophobic in nature, with an interface of 1,150 Å2 between helix α4 (Leu124, Leu127, and Tyr131) in molecule A and helix α0 (Met23, Phe25, Ile28, Tyr29, Phe31, and Phe32) in molecule B (Fig. 3B). In addition to these structural features, the Fo - Fc map showed a higher peak with a contour level of more than 13 σ near the wing region (Fig. 1, A and B). On the basis of the chemical components of the crystallization solution and the fact that the peak was near basic residues such as Arg104, Arg106, and Arg108 in the wing region (Fig. 1B), this peak was assigned to SO42-. Interestingly, these three arginine residues are completely conserved among all cyanobacterial Pex proteins (Fig. 2). Comparison of Pex with Other Winged-helix Proteins—Pfam (36Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R.

In fact, a search of the Protein Data Bank using the Dali server (37Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) showed that Pex is similar to replication terminator protein (RTP) of Bacillus subtilis (PDB code 1BM9, Z-score 10.0) (38Bussiere D.E.

Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Although their amino acid sequences are not homologous to that of Pex (sequence identity 10–19%), these proteins all have winged-helix motifs for DNA binding. The winged-helix motifs of Pex, RTP, SmtB, MecI, and MarR could be superimposed with root mean square deviations ranging from 2.4 to 4.0 Å. There is a large difference in a linker region between the α2 and α3 helices. The linker of Pex is significantly longer than those of the other four proteins and thus Asn73–Arg75 in this long linker of Pex can interact with His38–Leu40 in the N-terminal portion that precedes the winged-helix motif (Fig. 1, A and C). This interaction is not observed in the other four proteins due to conformational differences in the N-terminal region of the winged-helix motif. The arrangement of helix α4 in relation to the winged-hel"
https://openalex.org/W2045767106,"Protease-substrate interactions are governed by a variety of structural features. Although the substrate sequence specificities of numerous proteases have been established, “topological specificities,” whereby proteases may be classified based on recognition of distinct three-dimensional structural motifs, have not. The aggrecanase members of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family cleave a variety of proteins but do not seem to possess distinct sequence specificities. In the present study, the topological substrate specificity of ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) was examined using triple-helical or single-stranded poly(Pro) II helical peptides. Substrate topology modulated the affinity and sequence specificity of ADAMTS-4 with Km values indicating a preference for triple-helical structure. In turn, non-catalytic ADAMTS-4 domains were critical for hydrolysis of triple-helical and poly(Pro) II helical substrates. Comparison of ADAMTS-4 with MMP-1 (collagenase 1), MMP-13 (collagenase 3), trypsin, and thermolysin using triple-helical peptide (THP) and single-stranded peptide (SSP) substrates demonstrated that all five proteases possessed efficient “triple-helical peptidase” activity and fell into one of two categories: (kcat/Km)SSP > (kcat/Km)THP (thermolysin, trypsin, and MMP-13) or (kcat/Km)THP ≥ (kcat/Km)SSP and (Km)SSP > (Km)THP (MMP-1 and ADAMTS-4). Overall these results suggest that topological specificity may be a guiding principle for protease behavior and can be utilized to design specific substrates and inhibitors. The triplehelical and single-stranded poly(Pro) II helical peptides represent the first synthetic substrates successfully designed for aggrecanases. Protease-substrate interactions are governed by a variety of structural features. Although the substrate sequence specificities of numerous proteases have been established, “topological specificities,” whereby proteases may be classified based on recognition of distinct three-dimensional structural motifs, have not. The aggrecanase members of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family cleave a variety of proteins but do not seem to possess distinct sequence specificities. In the present study, the topological substrate specificity of ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) was examined using triple-helical or single-stranded poly(Pro) II helical peptides. Substrate topology modulated the affinity and sequence specificity of ADAMTS-4 with Km values indicating a preference for triple-helical structure. In turn, non-catalytic ADAMTS-4 domains were critical for hydrolysis of triple-helical and poly(Pro) II helical substrates. Comparison of ADAMTS-4 with MMP-1 (collagenase 1), MMP-13 (collagenase 3), trypsin, and thermolysin using triple-helical peptide (THP) and single-stranded peptide (SSP) substrates demonstrated that all five proteases possessed efficient “triple-helical peptidase” activity and fell into one of two categories: (kcat/Km)SSP > (kcat/Km)THP (thermolysin, trypsin, and MMP-13) or (kcat/Km)THP ≥ (kcat/Km)SSP and (Km)SSP > (Km)THP (MMP-1 and ADAMTS-4). Overall these results suggest that topological specificity may be a guiding principle for protease behavior and can be utilized to design specific substrates and inhibitors. The triplehelical and single-stranded poly(Pro) II helical peptides represent the first synthetic substrates successfully designed for aggrecanases. Collagen catabolism is considered a committed physiological event in remodeling of tissues and embryonic development as well as a critical step in the pathology of numerous diseases (1Cawston T.E.

The triple-helical structure of collagen renders it resistant to most proteases. Several members of the metallopeptidase “clan” MA(M), specifically matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; Dnp, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; fTHP, fluorogenic triple-helical peptide; Hyp, 4-hydroxy-l-proline; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Mca, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl; SSP, single-stranded peptide; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; THP, triple-helical peptide; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; Dnp, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; fTHP, fluorogenic triple-helical peptide; Hyp, 4-hydroxy-l-proline; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Mca, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl; SSP, single-stranded peptide; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; THP, triple-helical peptide; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. possess collagenolytic activity (4Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.2nd Ed. 1. Elsevier/Academic Press, Amsterdam2004: 472-769Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For example, one or more of the interstitial collagens (types I–III) are hydrolyzed within their triple-helical domain by MMP-1, -2, -8, -13, -14, and -18 (5Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 87-92Google Scholar). Other members of the MMP family, such as MMP-3, share similar primary and tertiary structures and substrate sequence specificities with collagenolytic MMPs but do not cleave triple-helical structures (6Murphy G.

Triple-helical structure itself provides favorable interactions with several MMPs (i.e. MMP-1 and MMP-8 hydrolyze a triple-helical substrate more efficiently than an analogous single-stranded one), whereas the activities of other MMPs, such as MMP-3, are reduced when susceptible sequences are incorporated within a triple-helical structure (9Lauer-Fields J.L.

Considerable evidence has accumulated that non-catalytic domains or regions beyond the active site, termed exosites, play significant roles in MMP recognition and processing of natural protein substrates (8Chung L.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The apparent regulatory role played by the collagen triple helix, in concert with recognition by regions beyond the protease active site, suggests that topology of the substrate may be an element of proteolytic specificity. In the present study we considered the topological specificity of the metallopeptidase family M12(B), which are members of the same MA(M) clan as MMPs but are not known to cleave triple-helical domains within collagens. More specifically, we examined the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family to evaluate the role of substrate topology on enzyme activity. Among the ADAMTS family members, several have been described to have proteolytic activity toward aggrecan (ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, -9, and -15), whereas others can remove the N-propeptide region from native interstitial procollagens (ADAMTS-2, -3, and -14) or cleave von Willebrand factor (ADAMTS-13) (16Apte S.S.

Interestingly the processing of the collagen N-propeptide region by ADAMTS-2 appears to require retention of substrate supersecondary (triple-helical) structure (19Tanzawa K. Berger J. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1120-1126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arnold W.V. Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Hattori H. Mechling D. Bächinger H.-P. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

In a similar fashion, N-terminal truncations in the interglobular domain of aggrecan reduce ADAMTS-4 activity toward the aggrecanase cleavage site (21Horber C. Buttner F.H. Kern C. Schmiedeknecht G. Bartnik E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) possibly due to alterations in the proteoglycan three-dimensional structure. Consistent with these results, short or random coil peptides modeled after aggrecan cleavage sites are not hydrolyzed efficiently by ADAMTS-1, ADAMTS-4, or ADAMTS-5 (21Horber C. Buttner F.H. Kern C. Schmiedeknecht G. Bartnik E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Sugimoto K. Takahashi M. Yamamoto Y. Shimada K. Tanzawa K. J.

Biochem. 2003; 314: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results suggest that members of the ADAMTS family require a distinct topology for efficient substrate hydrolysis and that some family members (such as ADAMTS-2, -3, and -14) may interact with a three-stranded motif. Furthermore ADAMTS-1 processes collagen-associated proteins (25Lind T. Birch M.A. McKie N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 281: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Canals F. Colome N. Ferrer C. del Carmen Plaza-Calonge M. Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Proteomics. 2006; 6: S28-S35Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, triple-helical topology may be generally recognized by ADAMTS family members. In the present study, we (a) designed potential substrates for ADAMTS-4 based on triple-helical or poly(Pro) II helical topologies, (b) utilized deletion mutants of ADAMTS-4 to evaluate the enzyme domains critical for processing of designed substrates, and (c) examined the collagenolytic activity and “topological specificity” of ADAMTS-4 in comparison with collagenolytic MMPs and proteases that cleave a wide variety of substrates (trypsin and thermolysin). Ultimately we were able to develop unique substrates for ADAMTS-4 and propose a role for the triple helix as a topology generally recognized by proteases. Materials—All standard chemicals were peptide synthesis or molecular biology grade and purchased from Fisher Scientific. Guinea pig skin type I collagen and gelatin were obtained as described previously (15Chung L. Dinakarpandian D. Yoshida N. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B. Visse R. Nagase H.

Amino acids are of the l-configuration. Hexanoic acid (CH3-(CH2)4-CO2H, designated C6) and decanoic acid (CH3(CH2)8CO2H, designated C10) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. THPs and SSPs were synthesized by Fmoc solid-phase methodology and purified in our laboratory by methods described previously (12Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Nagase H. Fields G.B.

Peptide Analyses—Analytical reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1100 liquid chromatograph equipped with a Vydac 218TP5415 C18 reversed-phase column (5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, 150 × 4.6 mm). Eluants were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B). The elution gradient was 0–100% B in 20 min with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Detection was at λ = 220, 324, and 363 nm. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed on a Hewlett-Packard G2025A LD-TOF or ABD DE-STR Voyager mass spectrometer using either α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or a 2,5-hydroxybenzoic acid/2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid (9:1, v/v) matrix (32Henkel W.

Single chain mass values were as follows: (α1(IV)1263–1277) SSP, [M + H]+ 1463.1 Da (theoretical mass, 1463.6 Da); fTHPa, [M + H]+ 4641.6 Da (theoretical mass, 4642.0 Da); and fSSPa, [M + H]+ 4645.1 Da (theoretical mass, 4642.0 Da). All mass values were within 0.07% of theoretical mass. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded over the range λ = 190–250 nm on a Jasco J-600 or J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1.0-cm-path length quartz cell. Thermal transition curves were obtained by recording the molar ellipticity ([θ]) at λ = 222 nm while the temperature was continuously increased in the range of 5–95 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/min. Temperature was controlled using a Jasco PTC-348WI temperature control unit. For samples exhibiting sigmoidal melting curves, the inflection point in the transition region (first derivative) is defined as the melting temperature (Tm). Enzymes—Pro-MMP-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and folded from the inclusion bodies as described previously (8Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-1 was activated by reaction with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and a 110 molar amount of MMP-3 at 37 °C for 6 h. After activation, MMP-3 was completely removed from MMP-1 by affinity chromatography using an anti-MMP-3 IgG Affi-Gel 10 column. Pro-MMP-13 was a generous gift from Dr. Maureen Horrocks, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, and was activated with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. The amounts of active MMP-1 and MMP-13 were determined by titration with recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) (34Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) over a concentration range of 0.1–3 μg/ml. Pro-MMP-1 with the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain deleted (residues 243–450; designated pro-MMP-1(Δ243–450)) was expressed in E. coli using the expression vector pET3a (Novagen), folded from inclusion bodies, and purified as described previously (35Suzuki K. Kan C.-C. Huang W. Gehring M.R. Brew K. Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The zymogen was activated as described above for the full-length pro-MMP-1. ADAMTS-4 and C-terminal deletion mutants were expressed in 293-EBNA cells and purified as described previously (36Kashiwagi M. Enghild J.J. Gendron C. Hughes C. Caterson B. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10109-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The concentrations of active recombinant ADAMTS-4 and variants were determined by titration with N-TIMP-3 (36Kashiwagi M. Enghild J.J. Gendron C. Hughes C. Caterson B. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10109-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Trypsin and thermolysin were obtained from Promega and Sigma, respectively. Assays—Two different peptidase assay methods were utilized, the first for discontinuous fluorometric analyses and the second for continuous fluorometric analyses. For the discontinuous assay method, (α1(IV)1263–1277) THP and (α1(IV)1263–1277) SSP were prepared as stock solutions in “fluorometric” assay buffer (50 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35). Enzyme (MMP-1, MMP-13, trypsin, and thermolysin) assays were carried out in assay buffer by incubating a range of substrate concentrations (20–200 μm) with 5–40 nm enzyme at 30 °C. Enzymatic activity was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of the enzyme/substrate solution to 30 μl of o-phenanthroline (20 mm) or 50 μm leupeptin at appropriate times. Rates of hydrolysis were monitored by the addition of 200 μl of fluorescamine solution. Fluorescamine solution was prepared by first dissolving fluorescamine in acetone at a concentration of 40 mm and then diluting the fluorescamine concentration to 5 mm with assay buffer minus Brij-35. Fluorescamine reacts with free amino groups, resulting in a fluorophore with λexcitation = 387 nm and λemission = 480 nm. Fluorescence was measured on a Molecular Devices SPEC-TRAmax Gemini dual scanning microplate spectrofluorometer. Rates of hydrolysis were obtained from plots of fluorescence versus time using only data points corresponding to less than 40% full hydrolysis. The slope from these plots was divided by the fluorescence change corresponding to complete hydrolysis and then multiplied by the substrate concentration to obtain hydrolysis rates in units of μm/s. For the continuous assay method, substrates fTHPa, fSSPa, fTHP-4, and fSSP-3 were prepared as stock solutions in fluorometric assay buffer. Enzyme (MMP-1, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, trypsin, and thermolysin) assays were carried out in assay buffer by incubating a range of substrate concentrations (1–64 μm) with 5–50 nm enzyme at 30 °C. Fluorescence was measured using λexcitation = 325 nm and λemission = 393 nm. Hydrolysis rates were obtained from plots of fluorescence versus time using only data points corresponding to less than 40% full hydrolysis. The slope from these plots was divided by the fluorescence change corresponding to complete hydrolysis and then multiplied by the substrate concentration to obtain initial velocity in units of μm/s. The fluorescence change corresponding to complete hydrolysis differed for fTHPs and fSSPs and as a function of temperature, and thus trends in rates of hydrolysis (where fluorescence is not corrected) occasionally differ from trends in kcat/Km. To determine activation energies (Ea), kinetic parameters were determined at 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C, and an Arrhenius plot of log kcat versus 1/temperature (K) was constructed where the slope = –Ea/2.3R (R is the molar gas constant). For all Ea value determinations, the highest temperature utilized was ∼10 °C below the Tm of the triple-helical substrate. Sites of substrate hydrolysis by ADAMTS-4, thermolysin, and trypsin were established by MALDI-TOF-MS and/or Edman degradation sequence analysis using an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer/120A analyzer as described previously (33Lauer-Fields J.L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 890: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sites of fTHP-4 and fSSP-3 hydrolysis by MMP-1 and MMP-13 have been evaluated previously (12Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5795-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Type I collagen, type IV collagen, and type I gelatin hydrolysis was analyzed as described previously (15Chung L.

Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were 50 nm for MMP-1, MMP-1(Δ243–450), and MMP-13; 225 nm for ADAMTS-4-3; 15 nm for thermolysin; 20 nm for trypsin; 1.8 mg/ml for type I collagen and gelatin; and 3.0 mg/ml for type IV collagen. Five milliliters of enzyme were incubated with 16 μl of type I collagen or gelatin or 10 μl of type IV collagen at 25 °C for 48 h. Samples were run on 15-well, 1.5-mm NuPAGE® 4–12% bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). ADAMTS-4 Substrate Design—To investigate topological requirements of a typical aggrecanase (ADAMTS-4, aggrecanase 1), we used chemically synthesized fluorescence resonance energy transfer triple-helical substrates in which (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (Mca) is the fluorophore and 2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) is the quencher (9Lauer-Fields J.L.

Chem. 2002; 383: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Substrate sequences were based on known aggrecanase cleavage sites in human aggrecan (38Nagase H. Kashiwagi M. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2003; 5: 94-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An ADAMTS-4 substrate was designed that utilized the aggrecan Glu1545↓Gly1546 cleavage site within a triple-helical structure. Residues 1540–1552 from human aggrecan (Thr-Ala-Ser-Glu-Leu-Glu1545↓Gly1546-Arg-Gly-Thr-Ile-Gly-Ile) were incorporated between five Gly-Pro-Hyp repeats at the N and C termini. Gly from the P4 subsite in the analogous bovine aggrecan sequence was used instead of Ser to retain a collagen-like Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating motif. Lys(Mca) and Lys(Dnp) were substituted for Ala and Ile in the P5 and P5′ subsites, respectively, resulting in fTHPa (Fig. 1). CD spectroscopy indicated a Tm value of 33 °C for fTHPa (Fig. 2). 3The use of C6- and C10-modified peptides results in triple helices that are stabilized by the alkyl chains (28Yu Y.-C. Tirrell M. Fields G.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9979-9987Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 29Yu Y.-C. Roontga V. Daragan V.A. Mayo K.H. Tirrell M. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in a fashion similar to covalent cross-linking of the three chains (33Lauer-Fields J.L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 890: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This greatly reduces concentration-dependent effects on triple helix stability (86Locardi E. Kwak J. Scheraga H.A. Goodman M. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1999; 103: 10561-10566Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), although, even without addition of the alkyl chains, such effects are minimal based on the range of substrate concentrations examined here. Additionally differences in substrate activities are not complicated by substrate aggregation. THPs containing N-terminal, C16 branched alkyl chains can aggregate to form micelles (87Gore T. Dori Y. Talmon Y. Tirrell M. Bianco-Peled H. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 5352-5360Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and C10 and C16 alkyl chains induce small aggregates of 18 and 22 triple helices, respectively (88Forns P. Lauer-Fields J.L. Gao S. Fields G.B. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, in these prior cases, the triple-helical peptide concentration was 0.5–1.5 mm. The present study used C6 and C10 triple-helical peptides at considerably lower concentrations (1–20 μm). Aggregates at these concentrations were not observed previously by dynamic light scattering (89Minond D. Lauer-Fields J.L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11474-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the high critical micellar concentrations of the potassium salts of octadecanoic acid (C18·K+), cis-Δ9-octadecanoic acid (C18:1·K+), and 12-hydroxy-cis-Δ9-octadecanoic acid (C18:1-OH·K+) at 0.5, 1.5, and 3.6 mm, respectively (90Myers D. Myers D. Surfactant Science and Technology. VCH Publishers, New York1988: 81-121Google Scholar). The fTHPa Tm value affords a unique opportunity in that assays may be performed when the substrate is in primarily a triple-helical (i.e. 25 °C) or non-triple-helical (i.e. 37 °C) conformation. A substrate analogous to fTHPa was designed of the same length and composition but without the ability to form a triple helix (fSSPa; Fig. 1). In this case, the Gly, Pro, and Hyp residues at the N and C termini were scrambled. The CD spectrum for fSSPa was indicative of a poly(Pro) II helix but not a triple helix, and a sigmoidal transition melt for fSSPa was not observed (data not shown).FIGURE 2Thermal transition curve for purified THPa in 0.25% (v/v) fluorometric assay buffer at a substrate concentration of 2 μm. Molar ellipticities ([θ]) were recorded at λ = 225 nm while the temperature was increased from 5 to 85 °C.

It has been reported that C-terminal processing of ADAMTS-4 initially enhanced general protease activity against S-carboxymethylated transferrin, fibromodulin, decorin, and versican (36Kashiwagi M.

If ADAMTS-4 possesses topological specificity, the use of ADAMTS-4 deletion mutants may identify the domain responsible for this specificity. Treatment of fTHPa with full-length ADAMTS-4 (ADAMTS-4-1) and four ADAMTS-4 deletion mutants at 25 °C followed by fluorescence and MALDI-MS analyses indicated that fTHPa was readily hydrolyzed by all proteases (Fig. 4, top) except ADAMTS-4-1 (data not shown). The lack of hydrolysis by ADAMTS-4-1 is not surprising as full-length ADAMTS-4 has a different aggrecan sequence specificity profile than the ADAMTS-4 deletion mutants (36Kashiwagi M. Enghild J.J.

We found that in these cells, lipopolysaccharide stimulates the expression of MHC II genes via the activation of Erk1/2, which is mediated by Toll-like receptor 4. Erk1/2 then phosphorylates the serine at position 357, which is located in a degron of CIITA isoform 1 that leads to its monoubiquitylation. Thus modified, CIITA isoform 1 binds P-TEFb, which mediates the elongation of RNA polymerase II and co-transcriptional processing of nascent transcripts. This induction leads to the expression of MHC II genes. Subsequent polyubiquitylation results in the degradation of CIITA isoform 1. Thus, the signaling cascade from Toll-like receptor 4 to CIITA isoform 1 represents one connection between innate and adaptive immunity in macrophages.

Thus, the signaling cascade from Toll-like receptor 4 to CIITA isoform 1 represents one connection between innate and adaptive immunity in macrophages. The immune system is composed of innate immunity, which performs the function of immune surveillance, and adaptive immunity, which eliminates non-self-antigens and creates the immune memory. Constituents of the former are antigen-presenting cells and of the latter are B and T cells. Because the establishment of adaptive immunity is dependent on innate immunity, appropriate interactions between them are indispensable for the normal function of the immune system. Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells that remove and digest invading pathogens as well as present antigenic peptides, thus directing the immune response against them. They sense the presence of these pathogens via their pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 2The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MHC, major histocompatibility complex class; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TLR, Toll-like receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; CIITA, class II transactivator; IF, isoform; AAD, acidic activation domain; P-TEFb, positive transcription elongation factor b; CycT1, cyclin T1; MEK, MAPK/Erk kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; ALLN, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-l-norleucinal. flagellin, etc., which is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (1Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). For example, the binding between LPS and TLR4 triggers a signaling cascade that results in the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), and Jun kinases (JNK), as well as of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (2Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). This signaling leads to the presentation of antigenic peptides in the groove of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules to CD4+ T cells and subsequently to the establishment of adaptive immunity (1Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Because MHC II determinants are involved directly in the establishment of adaptive immunity, it is not surprising that their expression is tightly regulated. One of the levels of this regulation is at transcription and is mediated by the class II transactivator (CIITA). Transcription of CIITA can be initiated from three distinct promoters called PI, PIII, and PIV, which direct the synthesis of three isoforms (IF) of CIITA: IF1, IF3 and IF4 (3Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Different isoforms are expressed following distinct stimuli in different cells. Whereas CIITA IF1 is expressed in macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells, CIITA IF3 is expressed in B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (4LeibundGut-Landmann S. Waldburger J.M. Reis e Sousa C. Acha-Orbea H. Reith W. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Only one study has been performed on CIITA IF1 (5Nickerson K. Sisk T.J. Inohara N. Yee C.S.

CIITA isoforms do not bind to DNA. Rather they bind to the preformed enhanceosome on MHC II promoters, where they recruit general transcription factors (13Fontes J.D. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Toth C.R.

Transcription of eukaryotic genes is a highly coordinated process and is often regulated by post-translational modifications of activators. The most studied are post-translational modifications of proteins containing class II B or acidic activation domains (AADs). The phosphorylation of proteolytic signaling elements, called degrons, which are located in or near these AADs, leads to their monoubiquitylation and higher transcriptional activity. Subsequent polyubiquitylation finally results in their degradation (22Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Indeed, by binding the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is composed of cyclin T1 (CycT1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9), the monoubiquitylated VP16 protein increases the rates of elongation rather than initiation of transcription (23Kurosu T. Peterlin B.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Of note, cyclin-dependent kinase 9 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and the negative transcription elongation factor, which contains 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole-sensitivity inducing factor and negative elongation factor (24Sims III, R.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). These changes lead additionally to co-transcriptional processing of nascent mRNA species. LPS increases the levels of MHC II molecules on macrophages via an unknown mechanism (25Figueiredo F. Koerner T.J. Adams D.O. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3781-3786PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wentworth P.A. Ziegler H.K. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3167-3173PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found that TLR4, which binds LPS, directs several post-translational modifications of CIITA IF1. These modifications include its phosphorylation and monoubiquitylation. They lead to the binding between CIITA IF1 and P-TEFb, which increases the transcriptional activity of CIITA IF1 and thus the expression of MHC II genes. Subsequent polyubiquitylation results in a rapid degradation of CIITA IF1. Thus, these findings connect the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. Animals, Cells, and Cell Culture—C57BL/10ScN mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in our colony. HeLa, COS, and RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics.

Transient Transfection and CAT Assay—The cells were seeded into 100-mm-diameter Petri dishes ∼12 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with FuGene 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). CAT enzymatic assays were performed as described (29Fujinaga K. Cujec T.P. Peng J. Garriga J. Price D.H. Grana X. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fold transactivation represents the ratio between the CIITA-activated transcription and the activity of the reporter plasmid alone. Immunoprecipitation Assay and Western Blot Analysis—The cells were transfected with 2 μg of indicated plasmid vectors. About 18 h after transfection, the immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (12Tosi G. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M.

Precipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed by chemiluminiscence assay from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays, RT-PCR, and Quantitative Real-time PCR—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (30Jiang H. Zhang F. Kurosu T. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell.

In Vitro Transcription and Translation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—f:CIITA1 and f:CIITA1(S357A) were expressed in vitro by using coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription and translation system from Promega (Madison, WI). In vitro kinase assay with Erk1/2 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Pulse-Chase Analysis—18 h after transfection, COS cells were starved for 2 h in medium without cysteine and methionine. Radioactive labeling with [S35]cysteine and [S35]methionine was performed for 40 min. After the labeling, the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for indicated time periods. The cells were lysed for 45 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation. Precipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by radiography. LPS Increases the Expression of MHC II Determinants via TLR4 in Mouse Macrophages—Upon stimulation with LPS, macrophages increase the surface levels of MHC II molecules (1Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Via TLR4, LPS also activates Erk1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPKs (2Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked two questions. First, does the expression of MHC II determinants depend on TLR4? Second, does this induction depend on any of these kinases? To answer the first question, we infected primary bone marrow-derived macrophages from TLR4–/– mice with TLR4 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4) or an empty vector as the control (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Two days later, we stimulated these macrophages with LPS for 2 h (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3) or left them untreated (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 4). To exclude a possible translocation of MHC II molecules from the cytoplasm to the cell surface, we examined their levels by Western blotting rather than by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Indeed, LPS induced the expression of MHC II determinants only in macrophages that expressed TLR4 (12 h; Fig. 1A, top panel, compare lane 3 with lanes 1, 2, and 4), which correlated with the activation of Erk1/2 by 20 min (Fig. 1A, middle panel, compare lanes 1–4). Levels of Erk1/2 were comparable in all samples (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). These results indicate that LPS activates Erk1/2 and increases the expression of MHC II determinants in primary macrophages via TLR4. To answer the second question, we duplicated these experiments in RAW 264.7 cells, which are a mouse macrophage cell line. At identical time points, we determined levels of MHC II determinants (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). Indeed, LPS induced the expression of MHC II genes in RAW 264.7 cells equivalently to primary macrophages (Fig. 1B, top panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, when these cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor UO 126 prior to the addition of LPS, the expression of MHC II determinants was abolished (Fig. 1B, top panel, compare lanes 2 and 3). These experiments were repeated with inhibitors of JNK and p38 MAPKs, but they had no effect on the induction of MHC II determinants by LPS (data not presented). UO 126 is a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor that prevents the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Erk1/2. These findings were confirmed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-Erk1/2 antibodies (20 min; Fig. 1B, bottom panel, compare lanes 2 and 3). Moreover, as presented in supplemental Fig. S1 (top panel, lanes 1–6), the activation of Erk1/2 was detectable by 10 min and disappeared by 2 h upon the addition of LPS in primary cells. We conclude that the activation of Erk1/2 precedes and is required for the induction of MHC II determinants by LPS. To determine effects of LPS on MHC II transcription, we stimulated RAW 264.7 cells with LPS and measured levels of I-Aα transcripts starting at the zero time point. After 2 h, the cells were washed, and the medium was changed. We performed RT-PCR at the indicated time points (Fig. 1C, top panel). Initially, we did not detect MHC II transcripts in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1C, top panel, lane 1). They appeared 1 h and peaked 2 h after the addition of LPS (Fig. 1C, top panel, compare lanes 3 and 4). 4 h later, MHC II transcripts disappeared almost completely (Fig. 1C, top panel, lane 5). Importantly, the levels of actin mRNA, which we used as the internal control, were equivalent in all samples (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). Thus, LPS activates transiently Erk1/2, which is followed by the induction of MHC II transcription. Next, we wanted to determine whether the expression of MHC II genes depended on the de novo synthesis of CIITA. Because different isoforms of CIITA had been described in RAW 264.7 cells (33Giroux M. Schmidt M. Descoteaux A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4187-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Nikcevich K.M. Piskurich J.F. Hellendall R.P. Wang Y. Ting J.P. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 99: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we investigated first CIITA IF1, IF3, and IF4 transcripts by RT-PCR in the presence and absence of LPS in these cells. However, as presented in supplemental Fig. S2, only CIITA IF1 mRNA encodes a functional CIITA protein in RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, CIITA IF1 was the only isoform that we detected by immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blotting in these cells (see Fig. 3D, bottom panel). Next, we performed quantitative real time RT-PCR to quantify mRNA levels of CIITA IF1 in stimulated and unstimulated cells (Fig. 1D). Time points 0, 2, and 4 h correspond to samples from Fig. 1C (lanes 1, 4, and 5). Surprisingly, the stimulation with LPS for 2 h decreased levels of CIITA IF1 mRNA up to 7-fold, compared with those in unstimulated cells. Thus, we conclude that LPS induces the transcription of MHC II genes without a concomitant increase in CIITA IF1 transcripts in macrophages. Moreover, this stimulation depends on TLR4 and the activation of Erk1/2 and leads to a transient induction of transcription of MHC II genes. Erk1/2 Phosphorylates CIITA IF1 on the Serine at Position 357—Effects of LPS on levels of MHC class II determinants depend on the activation of Erk1/2. Moreover, CIITA IF1 directs the transcription of MHC II genes in macrophages. However, because the amounts of CIITA IF1 mRNA actually decreased (Fig. 1D), we hypothesized that Erk1/2 modifies the preformed CIITA IF1 for its increased transcriptional activity. When analyzed by gel electrophoresis, CIITA IF3 migrates as a double band, which has been attributed to its phosphorylation (6Greer S.F. Harton J.A. Linhoff M.W. Janczak C.A. Ting J.P. Cressman D.E. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Sisk T.J. Nickerson K. Kwok R.P. Chang C.H. Int. Immunol. 2003; 15: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Tosi G. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5467-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment with λ-phosphatase and direct labeling revealed that the upper band represents the phosphorylated form of CIITA IF3 (12Tosi G. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5467-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because it also appears as a double band, we wanted to determine whether CIITA IF1 is also modified by phosphorylation. Thus, we expressed the FLAG epitope-tagged CIITA IF1 protein (f:CIITA1) (Fig. 2A, lane 1) in COS cells. In these cells, Erk1/2 is active constitutively. Thus, they do not need the stimulation by LPS. An aliquot of cell lysates was incubated with λ-phosphatase, which removes phosphates from serines and threonines (Fig. 2A, lane 2). As expected, the upper f:CIITA1 band disappeared completely (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2). We conclude that CIITA IF1 is also phosphorylated in cells. Because in Fig. 1 we showed that the increased expression of MHC II determinants after LPS stimulation depended on the activation of Erk1/2, we searched for putative Erk1/2 phosphorylation sites in CIITA IF1. Erk1/2 is a proline-directed kinase with the consensus phosphorylation sequence PX(S/T)P, where the serine or threonine is phosphorylated. Indeed, there is only one consensus Erk1/2 phosphorylation site in CIITA IF1, which contains a serine at position 357 (S357) (Fig. 2B). To determine whether this site is phosphorylated, we created the mutant f:CIITA1 protein, where the serine at position 357 was changed to alanine (f:CIITA1(S357A)). Next, we expressed both the wild type f:CIITA1 and the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) proteins in COS cells (Fig. 2C). We made two observations. First, expression levels of the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) protein were 4-fold higher than those of the f:CIITA1 protein (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2). Second, the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) protein migrated as a single lower band (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2), which represents the nonphosphorylated form of CIITA IF1. Thus, we conclude that CIITA IF1 is phosphorylated on Ser357 in cells. Next, we wanted to determine whether Erk1/2 is involved in the phosphorylation of CIITA IF1 and whether the upper band of CIITA IF1 would diminish under the influence of UO 126. Again we expressed f:CIITA1 (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2) and treated COS cells with UO 126 (Fig. 2D, lane 2) or the solvent as the control (Fig. 2D, lane 1). As expected, in the presence of UO 126, the upper band of f:CIITA1 disappeared (Fig. 2D, top panel, compare lanes 1 and 2), which correlated with the absence of phosphorylated Erk1/2 (Fig. 2D, bottom panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). This finding suggests that Erk1/2 is involved in the phosphorylation of CIITA IF1. To extend our findings, we determined whether Erk1/2 could phosphorylate CIITA IF1 in vitro and whether this phosphorylation depended on Ser357. Thus, we performed in vitro kinase assays with Erk1/2. Wild type f:CIITA1 and mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) proteins were transcribed and translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro (Fig. 2E). Aliquots of the reaction were incubated with Erk1/2 (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 4) or with the reaction buffer as the control (Fig. 2E, lanes 1 and 3). Indeed, as indicated by the appearance of the upper band, Erk1/2 phosphorylated the wild type f:CIITA1 protein (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, Erk1/2 did not phosphorylate the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) protein, which was confirmed by the absence of the upper band (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 2). Overall, we conclude that Erk1/2 phosphorylates Ser357 in CIITA IF1 in vitro and in vivo. CIITA IF1 Is Ubiquitylated in Cells—Thus far, we determined not only that Erk1/2 phosphorylates Ser357 in f:CIITA1, but we also observed that this phosphorylation affects the stability of f:CIITA1. Namely, expression levels of the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) protein were higher than those of f:CIITA1 (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2). These findings led us to hypothesize that the phosphorylation and degradation of CIITA IF1 could be connected via ubiquitin. To address this notion, we determined first whether different expression levels of f:CIITA1 and mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) proteins were due to differences in their rates of degradation. We expressed f:CIITA1 (Fig. 3A, top panel) and the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) proteins (Fig. 3A, bottom panel) and performed pulse-chase analyses in COS cells. Indeed, the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) protein had a half-life of ∼2 h, which was four times longer than that of f:CIITA1 (Fig. 3A, compare top and bottom panels). We conclude that the phosphorylation of CIITA IF1 leads to its degradation. Next, we wanted to determine whether CIITA IF1 was degraded via the proteasome. We expressed f:CIITA1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2) and the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4) proteins in COS cells. Transfected cells were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor ALLN for 6 h (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4) and the solvent as the control (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 3). ALLN increased levels of only the phosphorylated form of f:CIITA1 ∼4-fold (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2, compare top and bottom bands). It had almost no effect on levels of the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) protein (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Thus, we conclude that the phosphorylated CIITA IF1 is also degraded via the proteasome. To determine whether CIITA IF1 is ubiquitylated, we performed ubiquitylation assays in vivo. In COS cells, we co-expressed f:CIITA1 with the Myc epitope-tagged ubiquitin (m:Ub) (Fig. 3C, lane 2) or an empty plasmid vector as the control (Fig. 3C, lane 1). Indeed, in the presence of f:CIITA1 and m:Ub, there was a strong ubiquitylation ladder (Fig. 3C, lane 2). Because the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) protein was more stable than f:CIITA1, we assumed that the ubiquitylation of f:CIITA1 was dependent on the phosphorylation of Ser357. Thus, we performed the ubiquitylation assay in vivo with the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) protein (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4). Indeed, by densitometry we determined that the mutant f:CIITA1(S357A) protein was ubiquitylated 4-fold less than f:CIITA1 (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2 and 4). We conclude that CIITA IF1 is ubiquitylated, which is promoted by the phosphorylation of Ser357 in CIITA IF1. Finally, we asked whether the endogenous CIITA IF1 is also ubiquitylated in mouse macrophages. To address this question, we repeated ubiquitylation assays in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 3D). Because of low levels of expression or accelerated degradation, we were not able to detect CIITA IF1 or its ubiquitylation in untreated cells (Fig. 3D, lane 1) or cells treated with LPS and UO 126, respectively (data not presented). However, we were able to observe the heavily ubiquitylated CIITA IF1 only after treatment with LPS and ALLN (Fig. 3D, lane 2). We treated cells with ALLN for 2 h prior to 40 min of treatment with LPS. Afterward, the cells were incubated with ALLN for an additional 2 h. Interestingly, CIITA IF1 was present in phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms (Fig. 3D, bottom panel, lane 2), which can be explained by transient activation of Erk1/2 by LPS (Fig. 1D). Thus, we conclude that the endogenous CIITA IF1 is phosphorylated and ubiquitylated in RAW 264.7 cells. In CIITA IF1, there is a predicted PEST sequence from positions 360 to 385 (Fig. 3E). The phosphorylation of these sequences decreases the stability of proteins (22Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 35Yeh E.

Because the phosphorylation of Ser357, which is flanked by a proline, a serine, and an acidic residue, led to the degradation of CIITA IF1, we surmise that the actual PEST seq"

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These pathogenic bacteria have developed sophisticated heme uptake systems that harness the iron from heme-containing proteins present in the host (13Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar, 14Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu. Rev.

The HO enzymes from N. meningitidis (nmHO) and P. aeruginosa (paHO) are both essential for the utilization of iron from imported heme, and the crystal structures of these two bacterial HO enzymes have now been solved (16Friedman J. Lad L. Li H. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5239-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Schuller D.J. Zhu W. Stojiljkovic I. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11552-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although most HOs hydroxylate exclusively the α-meso heme carbon (Fig. 1), paHO is unusual because the γ-meso carbon is the predominate site of hydroxylation (18Caignan G.A. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Zeng Y. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Bunce R.A. Eastman M.A. Rivera M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14879-14892Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) even though the structure paHO is very much the same as other HOs. The difference in hydroxylation patterns is due to an ∼100° rotation of the heme in paHO relative to other HOs which places the γ-meso carbon at the same position in the active site as the α-meso carbon in other HOs (16Friedman J. Lad L. Li H. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5239-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The Fe(II) atom of the heme prosthetic group of heme proteins is an efficient binder of O2, NO, and CO, and the binding by heme proteins of these diatomic molecules is of critical importance to physiological processes such as respiration, vasodilation, and neurotransmission (19Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar, 20Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A common feature shared by all heme proteins is the need to not only bind its target ligand but also to discriminate against the binding of heme ligands of similar size and shape. Fe(II) adducts of CO are normally linear because backbonding is optimized by the overlap of Fe(II) d-orbitals with the empty π* orbitals of CO (22Ghosh A. Bocian D.F. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 6363-6367Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Spiro T.G. Jarzecki A.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Spiro T.G. Kozlowski P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, Fe(II)-NO and Fe(II)-O2 are naturally bent in order to maximize overlap with the occupied π* electrons of the ligand with the dz2 iron orbitals. Thus, the intrinsic binding geometries of these ligands can be utilized by heme proteins to increase ligand discrimination (25Jain R. Chan M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ligand discrimination by globins results from the preferred ligand geometries of bound O2 and CO (27Vojtechovsky J. Chu K. Berendzen J. Sweet R.M. Schlichting I. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2153-2174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The greater polarity of the bound O2 ligand also plays a role in enhancing the affinity of O2 relative to CO for both the globins and HO enzymes. The partition constant (M), defined as the ratio of the equilibrium association constants for CO and O2 (KCO/KO2), is ∼30,000 for free heme, whereas that for sperm whale myoglobin is only ∼40 and is further reduced to ∼4 for human heme oxygenase (28Migita C.T.

The O2 affinities of mammalian HO-1 and HO-2 are 30–90-fold higher than those of mammalian myoglobins (28Migita C.T. Matera K.M. Ikeda-Saito M. Olson J.S. Fujii H. Yoshimura T. Zhou H. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 945-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas the O2 affinity of the bacterial HO from C. diphtheriae is 20-fold higher than that of myoglobin (29Unno M. Matsui T. Chu G.C. Couture M. Yoshida T. Rousseau D.L. Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21055-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This increased O2 affinity is largely due to a 100-fold slower rate of dissociation from HO relative to the globins. Thus, even though the inherent affinity of the ferrous heme for O2 is lower than that for CO, myoglobin and heme oxygenase clearly alter the binding characteristics of the heme, dramatically increasing the O2 affinity relative to CO. Here we report the kinetic rate constants for the binding of CO and O2 by the bacterial heme oxygenases, nmHO and paHO, and provide a structural basis for ligand discrimination. Preparation of Ligand-bound Heme Oxygenases—Expression, purification, and reconstitution of the recombinant nmHO and paHO with heme were carried out as described previously (11Zhu W. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6783-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Ratliff M. Zhu W.M. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Spectral characterization and information on the stability of nmHO and paHO have been reported (11Zhu W. Wilks A.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Ligand binding reactions were measured using stopped-flow and flash photolysis techniques as described previously (30Farres J. Rechsteiner M.P. Herold S. Frey A.D. Kallio P.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4125-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Carver T.E. Olson J.S. Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3168-3176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CO forms of the enzymes were prepared by diluting the ferrous form of the heme·HO complex into anaerobic buffer solutions containing known CO concentrations. Because of the rapid rate of autooxidation of ferrous iron, the oxygenated forms of the enzymes were made as follows. First, the ferric heme·HO complex was reduced with sodium dithionite in deoxygenated buffer. Then, the reduced form of the complex was loaded onto a column of Sephadex G-25 and eluted with buffer containing known oxygen concentrations. Formation of the complex and sample integrity were confirmed by optical absorption spectra recorded before and after flash photolysis measurements. All of the kinetic measurements were carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 20 °C. Stock solutions of O2, CO, and NO were prepared by equilibrating the buffer with 1 atm of the pure gas at room temperature. If required, saturated stock solutions (1300 μm O2, 1000 μm CO, and 1800 μm NO) were diluted with degassed buffer in gas-tight Sample-Lock Hamilton syringes. Association Rate Constants—Oxygen association rate constants were measured by laser flash photolysis using a pulsed dye laser system fitted with a Quantel Brillian B Nd:YAG laser. Solutions were irradiated at λ = 540 nm (β-band of heme) with a pulse of 10 ns and monitored at λ = 434 nm (Fe2+ soret peak). CO association rate constants were measured by stopped-flow kinetics using an Applied Photophysics SX18MV-R. Solutions were also monitored at λ = 434 nm. Final protein concentrations for each set of experiments were 10 μm. Time courses are the average of five traces, and the observed rates for O2 and CO binding by nmHO and paHO were obtained by fitting the average traces to a single exponential expression. Second-order association rate constants were obtained from the slopes of the linear plots of the observed pseudo-first-order rate constants versus ligand concentration. Dissociation Rate Constants—Dissociation rate constants for both O2 and CO were measured directly by carrying out replacement reactions with an Applied Photophysics SX18MV-R. The ligands of a 10 μm solution of the O2- and CO-bound forms of the HO enzymes were replaced by a high concentration of displacing ligand (500 μm CO and 900 μm NO, respectively). Solutions were measured at λ = 410 nm and λ = 420 nm in order to follow the absorbance changes due to the dissociation of O2 and CO, respectively. The dissociation rate constants were then calculated from the expressions kO2=kobs(1+kO2'[O2]/kCO'[CO]) and kCO=kobs(1+kCO'[CO]/kNO'[NO]). Because kNO'≫kCO' for all heme proteins, the observed replacement rate constant (kobs) was directly equal to the CO dissociation rate constant (kCO). Molecular Dynamics—Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out with Amber 8.0. Heme parameters were provided by Dr. Dan Harris (Molecular Research Institute). Partial charges for the heme and CO were taken from the ferrous·CO complex provided by Dr. John Straub (Boston University). The crystal structures for CO complexes of rat HO-1 (1IX4) and nmHO (1P3V) were stripped of crystallographically defined water molecules except for those in the active site near the bound CO. The solvent-stripped structure was solvated with water molecules within a 30 Å radius of the CO molecule. The entire solvated protein was energy minimized as follows. First, water and H atoms were allowed to move in a short 10-ps low temperature (50 °C) MD simulation followed by 500 cycles of energy minimization for both protein and solvent. Second, both protein and solvent were allowed to move in a 10-ps 50 °C MD simulation followed by 500 cycles of energy minimization. Finally, a 2-ns MD simulation was carried out at 300 °C. Residues within a 20 Å sphere surrounding the CO were allowed to move. Coordinate sets were saved every 10 ps, giving a total of 200 coordinate sets. During all minimizations and dynamics runs the CO molecule was constrained to the crystallographic coordinates. This was done to avoid ambiguity in modeling the Fe-C-O bond angle and tilt. Ligand Binding and Dissociation Kinetics—The association and dissociation rate constants for the binding of CO and O2 by nmHO and paHO are compared with those of myoglobin, mammalian HO-1, and bacterial cdHO, and protoheme in Table 1.

The association rate constants for O2 binding by nmHO and paHO are 5.0 and 4.5 μm-1 s-1, respectively. These values are ∼4-fold smaller than that of myoglobin but very similar to both the mammalian and bacterial HO enzymes. The CO association reactions of both the nmHO and paHO heme complexes are also monophasic, with the observed rates showing a linear dependence on the CO concentration. Although the time courses for the binding of CO by HO-1 and cdHO were moderately biphasic and could be fit to a two-exponential expression (29Unno M. Matsui T. Chu G.C. Couture M. Yoshida T.

The association rate constants for CO binding by nmHO and paHO are 1.10 and 0.90 μm-1 s-1, respectively. These values are similar to that of myoglobin, as well as those of HO-1 and cdHO. Sample traces for the CO and O2 association reactions are provided in Fig. 2, A and C, respectively. The second-order association rate constants for the binding of CO and O2 by nmHO and paHO were obtained from the slopes of the linear plots of the observed rate constants (kobs) versus ligand concentration (Fig. 2, E and F). The O2 dissociation rate constants for nmHO and paHO are 1.5 and 1.7 s-1, respectively. These data indicate that the dissociation rate constants for O2 binding by nmHO and paHO are ∼14-fold slower than that of myoglobin but are ∼7-fold faster than those of mammalian HO-1 and bacterial cdHO. The CO dissociation rate constants for nmHO and paHO are 0.16 and 0.12 s-1, respectively. The dissociation rate constants for CO binding by nmHO and paHO are ∼6-fold faster than that of myoglobin but are ∼22-fold faster than those of HO-1 and cdHO. Sample traces for the CO and O2 dissociation reactions are provided in Fig. 2, B and D, respectively. The oxygen equilibrium constants (KO2) for nmHO and paHO are 3.3 and 2.6 μm-1, respectively, which are ∼3-fold greater than that of myoglobin but ∼8-fold smaller than those of HO-1 and cdHO. The CO equilibrium constants (KCO) for nmHO and paHO are 6.9 and 7.5 μm-1, respectively, which are ∼5-fold smaller than that of myoglobin but are ∼17-fold smaller than those of HO-1 and cdHO. It should be noted that although the CO and O2 equilibrium constants (KCO and KO2) for nmHO and paHO are smaller than those of HO-1 and cdHO, the ratios of equilibrium constants (KCO/KO2) for nmHO and paHO are 2 and 3, respectively, which are similar to those of HO-1 and cdHO. The smaller CO and O2 affinities by nmHO and paHO are largely due to the much faster dissociation rate constants for these enzymes compared with HO-1 and cdHO. Structural Basis for Ligand Discrimination—The problem in understanding ligand discrimination is illustrated in Table 1. Protoheme binds CO ∼30,000-fold more tightly than O2 but only 40-fold more tightly in myoglobin. Steric factors were long thought to be the predominant structural underpinning of such ligand discrimination in heme proteins. Early on, Collman et al. (32Collman J.P. Brauman J.I. Halbert T.R. Suslick K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3333-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) proposed that a strategically placed distal histidine in myoglobin could accommodate a bent O2 ligand but would inhibit the binding of a normally linear CO ligand. However, in recent years structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies have revealed the importance of electrostatic interactions for diatomic ligand discrimination (25Jain R. Chan M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Sigfridsson E. Ryde U. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Sigfridsson E. Ryde U. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been shown that the H-bond between the distal His in myoglobin and O2 is quite important in controlling O2 affinity (35Olson J.S. Phillips G.N. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 544-552Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The HO crystal structures show that steric crowding is an important factor in HO although electrostatics also is quite important. Dioxygen-bound cdHO has two strong hydrogen bonds that can preferentially stabilize the highly polar Fe·O2 complex (29Unno M. Matsui T. Chu G.C. Couture M. Yoshida T. Rousseau D.L. Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21055-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). One interaction is with the amide NH of Gly-139, and the other is with the distal pocket water molecule. Mutagenesis studies have also demonstrated that increasing the strength and number of hydrogen bonds donated from the distal pocket amino acids to the iron-bound O2 decreases the rate of O2 dissociation from myoglobin (36Krzywda S. Murshudov G.N. Brzozowski A.M. Jaskolski M. Scott E.E. Klizas S.A. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. Wilkinson A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15896-15907Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Smerdon S.J.

Brunori M. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7509-7519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the more extensive H-bonding in HO-1 compared with myoglobin explains why koff of O2 is slower in HO-1 and thus is a major contributing factor in ligand discrimination. Whether or not this view holds with all HOs will require additional structures of oxy complexes, but unfortunately obtaining such structures is very difficult. However, NO is a good mimic of O2 because, like O2, NO prefers a bent geometry. Moreover, the structure of the rat HO-1·NO (39Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9898-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) complex exhibits a very similar H-bonding pattern as the cdHO·O2 complex (Fig. 3D). Thus, a comparison between various CO and NO complexes provides some insights on O2/CO discrimination. Currently, the only two heme oxygenases that have crystal structures available for both the CO- and NO-bound forms are those of nmHO and rat HO-1 (39Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9898-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Friedman J. Lad L. Deshmukh R. Li H. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34654-34659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, the NO has three H-bonding partners, the peptide NH of Gly-143 and a water molecule which, as already noted, is very similar to the cdHO·oxy complex (29Unno M. Matsui T. Chu G.C. Couture M. Yoshida T. Rousseau D.L. Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21055-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The situation with nmHO is slightly different. In this case the NO forms only one H-bond, with the active site water. The peptide NH group of Gly-120 (Fig. 3B) is too far and geometry not optimal for good H-bonding. If, as we expect, the oxy complex is similar, then the missing H-bond in nmHO compared with HO-1 helps to explain why koff for O2 is faster in nmHO than in HO-1 or cdHO. The more significant difference between nmHO and HO-1 or cdHO is that koff for CO is ∼18 times faster, indicating that the nmHO·CO complex is less stable that in HO-1. HO-1 undergoes a fairly large structural change in response to CO binding, whereas nmHO does not. To accommodate the CO ligand, which prefers a linear Fe-C-O geometry, the distal helix in HO-1 shifts by ∼1.0 Å and the CO-bound heme shifts by ∼1.0 Å in the opposite direction. The bent NO, however, leads to very little change. In sharp contrast, the nmHO structure does not change when CO binds. As a result, the CO may experience less favorable electrostatic interactions than in HO-1. More specifically, in HO-1·CO the active site water is 2.9 Å from the CO whereas this distance is 3.1 Å in nmHO (Fig. 3, A and C). In addition, the CO is very close, 2.7 Å, to the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-117 whereas the corresponding distance is 2.9 Å in HO-1 (Fig. 3, A and C). A 0.2 Å difference is small and probably within the margin of error in comparing two structures. Thus, it is difficult to conclude that differences in steric crowding are the structural basis for the differences in CO koff. Here is where the molecular dynamics simulations provided some insights that point toward electrostatics as being an important factor in controlling the stability of the CO complex. The average MD structure (average of 100 structures) taken over the last 1 ns of the simulation superimposed on the crystal structures is shown in Fig. 4. Also shown in panels B and D are the average MD structures together with key distances. There are two important differences between nmHO and HO-1. First, note that in HO-1 the peptide carbonyl O atom of Gly-139 is tied up in a helical H-bond with Gly-144 (Fig. 4B) whereas the corresponding carbonyl O atom in nmHO (Ser-117) is not (Fig. 4D). As a result, the partial negative charge on the carbonyl O atom of Ser-117 in nmHO is not attenuated by H-bonds, thus providing greater electrostatic destabilization of the CO O atom than in HO-1. Second, the water near the CO in HO-1 is closer to the CO than in nmHO, thus providing greater electrostatic stabilization of the CO O atom. Over the 2-ns simulation the water-CO distance is 4.61 ± 0.97 Å in HO-1 and 5.83 ± 1.29 Å in nmHO-1. There is a fair amount of fluctuation owing to large movement of solvent as expected, but it is clear that the CO is better solvated in HO-1. Thus, less electrostatic stabilization of and greater electrostatic repulsion of CO in nmHO can help to explain the faster koff for CO. One problem with this argument is that CO is normally considered to be the least polar of heme diatomic ligands and, as such, electrostatics should not play that important a role in CO binding. However, electrostatic control of CO binding is supported by model heme studies. One comprehensive study on CO- and O2-bound twin-coronet porphyrins (TCPs) established that CO/O2 ligand discrimination may be controlled by the polar effects exerted by overhanging hydroxyl groups (41Tani F. Matsu-ura M. Ariyama K. Setoyama T. Shimada T. Kobayashi S. Hayashi T. Matsuo T. Hisaeda Y. Naruta Y. Chem. Eur. J. 2003; 9: 862-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Specifically, the TCP·O2 complex was stabilized by hydrogen bonding with two overhanging hydroxyl groups, whereas the TCP·CO complex was destabilized because of suppression of π backbonding from the iron atom to bound CO. The decrease in backbonding was caused by strong negative electrostatic interactions of bound CO with the lone pairs of the hydroxyl groups in the distal pocket, which resulted in an increase in the dissociation rate of CO from TCP compared with chelated protoheme (41Tani F. Matsu-ura M. Ariyama K. Setoyama T. Shimada T. Kobayashi S. Hayashi T. Matsuo T. Hisaeda Y. Naruta Y. Chem. Eur. J. 2003; 9: 862-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These model heme studies thus support the view that the reason nmHO exhibits a slower CO koff than HO-1 is due to less favorable electrostatic stabilization of the CO complex compared with HO-1."
