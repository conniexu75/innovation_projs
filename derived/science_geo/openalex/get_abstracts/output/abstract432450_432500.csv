https://openalex.org/W2014678245,"Bacteria can be trapped by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in vitro, but their relevance in vivo is uncertain, in part because NETs are thought to be released by dying neutrophils, thereby eliminating the other antimicrobial functions of these cells. Paul Kubes and his colleagues report in this issue that NET release need not kill neutrophils and that NETosis can by dynamically imaged in vivo. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released as neutrophils die in vitro in a process requiring hours, leaving a temporal gap that invasive microbes may exploit. Neutrophils capable of migration and phagocytosis while undergoing NETosis have not been documented. During Gram-positive skin infections, we directly visualized live polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) in vivo rapidly releasing NETs, which prevented systemic bacterial dissemination. NETosis occurred during crawling, thereby casting large areas of NETs. NET-releasing PMNs developed diffuse decondensed nuclei, ultimately becoming devoid of DNA. Cells with abnormal nuclei showed unusual crawling behavior highlighted by erratic pseudopods and hyperpolarization consistent with the nucleus being a fulcrum for crawling. A requirement for both Toll-like receptor 2 and complement-mediated opsonization tightly regulated NET release. Additionally, live human PMNs injected into mouse skin developed decondensed nuclei and formed NETS in vivo, and intact anuclear neutrophils were abundant in Gram-positive human abscesses. Therefore early in infection NETosis involves neutrophils that do not undergo lysis and retain the ability to multitask."

This species is a wild South American cotton, whose progenitor is thought to have been the contributor of the D subgenome of the allotetraploid commercial species Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense, which account for ~95% of the worldwide cotton crop. We have sequenced and assembled a draft genome of G. raimondii, whose progenitor is the putative contributor of the D subgenome to the economically important fiber-producing cotton species Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense. Over 73% of the assembled sequences were anchored on 13 G. raimondii chromosomes. The genome contains 40,976 protein-coding genes, with 92.2% of these further confirmed by transcriptome data. Evidence of the hexaploidization event shared by the eudicots as well as of a cotton-specific whole-genome duplication approximately 13–20 million years ago was observed. We identified 2,355 syntenic blocks in the G. raimondii genome, and we found that approximately 40% of the paralogous genes were present in more than 1 block, which suggests that this genome has undergone substantial chromosome rearrangement during its evolution. Cotton, and probably Theobroma cacao, are the only sequenced plant species that possess an authentic CDN1 gene family for gossypol biosynthesis, as revealed by phylogenetic analysis."

However, these nanocrystalline metals are not thermally stable; at elevated temperatures the grains will grow and merge. Alloying with a second metal to slow grain growth can slow down this process, which has shown some success on a trial-and-error basis. Chookajorn et al. (p. 951 ; see the Perspective by Weertman ) now provide a theoretical framework to create stability maps to identify potential alloys with the greatest thermal stability. For tungsten, counterintuitively, the theory suggests that atoms with the largest size differential or lowest solubility are not the best alloying choice. Indeed, an alloy of tungsten and titanium was processed more easily than pure nanocrystalline tungsten and also showed better stability at high temperatures."

Mucus—experienced, for example, in the form of a runny nose or productive cough—is one of the tools the body uses to expel or prevent the uptake of foreign matter. In a number of diseases, a failure of the normal mucus-control system leads to obstructions of the airways and respiratory problems. Button et al. (p. 937 ; see the Perspective by Dickey ) examine the existing gel-on-liquid model, where the mucus is thought to sit on a watery periciliary layer around the beating lung cilia that has been used to explain the flow of mucus. A gel-on-brush model is proposed where the mucus sits on a brushlike periciliary layer. The key elements of this layer are membrane-tethered macromolecules that cause normal flow and clearance of mucus. When dehydrated, the interface is disrupted, preventing normal mucus motion."
https://openalex.org/W1988303870,"Cancer drugs often induce dramatic responses in a small minority of patients. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the genetic basis of a durable remission of metastatic bladder cancer in a patient treated with everolimus, a drug that inhibits the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. Among the somatic mutations was a loss-of-function mutation in TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1), a regulator of mTOR pathway activation. Targeted sequencing revealed TSC1 mutations in about 8% of 109 additional bladder cancers examined, and TSC1 mutation correlated with everolimus sensitivity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using whole-genome sequencing in the clinical setting to identify previously occult biomarkers of drug sensitivity that can aid in the identification of patients most likely to respond to targeted anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2125836344,"Cancer cells engage in a metabolic program to enhance biosynthesis and support cell proliferation. The regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) influence altered glucose metabolism in cancer. The interaction of PKM2 with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins inhibits enzyme activity and increases the availability of glycolytic metabolites to support cell proliferation. This suggests that high pyruvate kinase activity may suppress tumor growth. We show that expression of PKM1, the pyruvate kinase isoform with high constitutive activity, or exposure to published small-molecule PKM2 activators inhibits the growth of xenograft tumors. Structural studies reveal that small-molecule activators bind PKM2 at the subunit interaction interface, a site that is distinct from that of the endogenous activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). However, unlike FBP, binding of activators to PKM2 promotes a constitutively active enzyme state that is resistant to inhibition by tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. These data support the notion that small-molecule activation of PKM2 can interfere with anabolic metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2021014465,"Embryonic Cell Sorting and Movement Differential cell adhesion has long been thought to drive cell sorting. Maître et al. (p. 253 , published online 23 August) show that cell sorting in zebrafish gastrulation is triggered by differences in the ability of cells to modulate cortex tension at cell-cell contacts, thereby controlling contact expansion. Cell adhesion functions in this process by mechanically coupling the cortices of adhering cells at their contacts, allowing cortex tension to control contact expansion. In zebrafish epiboly the enveloping cell layer (EVL)—a surface epithelium formed at the animal pole of the gastrula—gradually spreads over the entire yolk cell to engulf it at the end of gastrulation. Behrndt et al. (p. 257 ) show that an actomyosin ring connected to the epithelial margin triggers EVL spreading both by contracting around its circumference and by generating a pulling force through resistance against retrograde actomyosin flow."
https://openalex.org/W2137741805,"Metabolic Sensor The enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes the transfer of N -acetylglucosamine from uridine diphospho- N -acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serine or threonine residues of intracellular proteins and responds to the metabolic status of the cell. Yi et al. (p. 975 ; see the Perspective by Mattaini and Vander Heiden ) show that O-GlcNAcylation of phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) reduces its activity, thus influencing rates of glycolysis within cells. O-GlcNAcylation of PFK1 was increased in cells exposed to hypoxia, and was increased in several cell lines derived from human tumors. Thus, metabolic changes mediated by O-GlcNAcylation may benefit anabolism and growth of cancer cells. However, glycosylation of PFK1 was not detected in rapidly proliferating normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W3037031488,"Supernovae (SNe), the luminous explosions of stars, were observed since antiquity, with typical peak luminosity not exceeding 1.2x10^{43} erg/s (absolute magnitude >-19.5 mag). It is only in the last dozen years that numerous examples of SNe that are substantially super-luminous (>7x10^{43} erg/s; <-21 mag absolute) were well-documented. Reviewing the accumulated evidence, we define three broad classes of super-luminous SN events (SLSNe). Hydrogen-rich events (SLSN-II) radiate photons diffusing out from thick hydrogen layers where they have been deposited by strong shocks, and often show signs of interaction with circumstellar material. SLSN-R, a rare class of hydrogen-poor events, are powered by very large amounts of radioactive 56Ni and arguably result from explosions of very massive stars due to the pair instability. A third, distinct group of hydrogen-poor events emits photons from rapidly-expanding hydrogen-poor material distributed over large radii, and are not powered by radioactivity (SLSN-I). These may be the hydrogen-poor analogs of SLSN-II."

https://openalex.org/W1976843984,"Complement is an ancient danger-sensing system that contributes to host defense, immune surveillance and homeostasis. C5a and its G protein–coupled receptor mediate many of the proinflammatory properties of complement. Despite the key role of C5a in allergic asthma, autoimmune arthritis, sepsis and cancer, knowledge about its regulation is limited. Here we demonstrate that IgG1 immune complexes (ICs), the inhibitory IgG receptor FcγRIIB and the C-type lectin–like receptor dectin-1 suppress C5a receptor (C5aR) functions. IgG1 ICs promote the association of FcγRIIB with dectin-1, resulting in phosphorylation of Src homology 2 domain–containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP) downstream of FcγRIIB and spleen tyrosine kinase downstream of dectin-1. This pathway blocks C5aR-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, C5a effector functions in vitro and C5a-dependent inflammatory responses in vivo, including peritonitis and skin blisters in experimental epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Notably, high galactosylation of IgG N-glycans is crucial for this inhibitory property of IgG1 ICs, as it promotes the association between FcγRIIB and dectin-1. Thus, galactosylated IgG1 and FcγRIIB exert anti-inflammatory properties beyond their impact on activating FcγRs."
https://openalex.org/W1981224101,"Mechanisms by which autophagy promotes cell survival or death are unclear. We provide evidence that C(18)-pyridinium ceramide treatment or endogenous C(18)-ceramide generation by ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1) expression mediates autophagic cell death, independent of apoptosis in human cancer cells. C(18)-ceramide-induced lethal autophagy was regulated via microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 β-lipidation, forming LC3B-II, and selective targeting of mitochondria by LC3B-II-containing autophagolysosomes (mitophagy) through direct interaction between ceramide and LC3B-II upon Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission, leading to inhibition of mitochondrial function and oxygen consumption. Accordingly, expression of mutant LC3B with impaired ceramide binding, as predicted by molecular modeling, prevented CerS1-mediated mitochondrial targeting, recovering oxygen consumption. Moreover, knockdown of CerS1 abrogated sodium selenite-induced mitophagy, and stable LC3B knockdown protected against CerS1- and C(18)-ceramide-dependent mitophagy and blocked tumor suppression in vivo. Thus, these data suggest a new receptor function of ceramide for anchoring LC3B-II autophagolysosomes to mitochondrial membranes, defining a key mechanism for the induction of lethal mitophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2076312582,"Wong et al. differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into mature airway epithelial cells expressing CFTR, a gene involved in cystic fibrosis. Applying the method to induced pluripotent stem cells derived from cystic fibrosis patients provides a renewable source of cells for drug screening. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene, which regulates chloride and water transport across all epithelia and affects multiple organs, including the lungs. Here we report an in vitro directed differentiation protocol for generating functional CFTR-expressing airway epithelia from human embryonic stem cells. Carefully timed treatment by exogenous growth factors that mimic endoderm developmental pathways in vivo followed by air-liquid interface culture results in maturation of patches of tight junction–coupled differentiated airway epithelial cells that demonstrate active CFTR transport function. As a proof of concept, treatment of CF patient induced pluripotent stem cell–derived epithelial cells with a small-molecule compound to correct for the common CF processing mutation resulted in enhanced plasma membrane localization of mature CFTR protein. Our study provides a method for generating patient-specific airway epithelial cells for disease modeling and in vitro drug testing."

https://openalex.org/W2004869330,"Recognizing Escaped Commensals In order to coexist peacefully, the billions of bacteria in our gut and our immune system have reached a détente. An intestinal mucosal firewall exists, so bacteria remain localized to the gut, where the immune system is tightly regulated so that these bacteria are tolerated. Enteric infections, however, lead to a breach in this mucosal firewall, resulting in exposure of the peripheral immune system to the intestinal bacterial contents. What is the result? Using oral Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice, Hand et al. (p. 1553 , published online 23 August) show that, besides the T. gondii –specific T cell response, a commensal bacteria–specific T cell response is elicited. The CD4 + T cell–specific response was tracked to a commensal-derived flagellin, and these T cells expanded after T. gondii infection and formed long-lived memory cells able to respond to subsequent challenges. Thus, enteric infections can lead to the formation of commensal bacteria–specific, long-lived memory T cells that reside throughout the body—which may play a role in intestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2005725359,"Cortical-feedback projections to primary sensory areas terminate most heavily in layer 1 (L1) of the neocortex, where they make synapses with tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons. L1 input is thought to provide ‘contextual’ information, but the signals transmitted by L1 feedback remain uncharacterized. In the rodent somatosensory system, the spatially diffuse feedback projection from vibrissal motor cortex (vM1) to vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1, also known as the barrel cortex) may allow whisker touch to be interpreted in the context of whisker position to compute object location. When mice palpate objects with their whiskers to localize object features, whisker touch excites vS1 and later vM1 in a somatotopic manner. Here we use axonal calcium imaging to track activity in vM1-->vS1 afferents in L1 of the barrel cortex while mice performed whisker-dependent object localization. Spatially intermingled individual axons represent whisker movements, touch and other behavioural features. In a subpopulation of axons, activity depends on object location and persists for seconds after touch. Neurons in the barrel cortex thus have information to integrate movements and touches of multiple whiskers over time, key components of object identification and navigation by active touch."
https://openalex.org/W2052024119,"Stellar Explosions Stars that are born with masses greater than eight times that of the Sun end their lives in luminous explosions known as supernovae. Over the past decade, access to improved sky surveys has revealed rare types of supernovae that are much more luminous than any of those that were known before. Gal-Yam (p. 927 ) reviews these superluminous events and groups them into three classes that share common observational and physical characteristics. Gamma-ray bursts are another type of extreme explosive events related to the death of massive stars, which occur once per day somewhere in the universe and produce short-lived bursts of gamma-ray light. Gehrels and Mészáros (p. 932 ) review what has been learned about these events since the launch of NASA's Swift (2004) and Fermi (2008) satellites. The current interpretation is that gamma-ray bursts are related to the formation of black holes. Type Ia supernovae are used as cosmological distance indicators. They are thought to be the result of the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarf stars in binary systems, but the nature of the stellar companion to the white dwarf is still debated. Dilday et al. (p. 942 ) report high-resolution spectroscopy of the supernova PTF 11kx, which was detected on 26 January 2011 by the Palomar Transient Factory survey. The data suggest a red giant star companion whose material got transferred to the white dwarf."
https://openalex.org/W2102406302,"Mutations are the raw material of evolution but have been difficult to study directly. We report the largest study of new mutations to date, comprising 2,058 germline changes discovered by analyzing 85,289 Icelanders at 2,477 microsatellites. The paternal-to-maternal mutation rate ratio is 3.3, and the rate in fathers doubles from age 20 to 58, whereas there is no association with age in mothers. Longer microsatellite alleles are more mutagenic and tend to decrease in length, whereas the opposite is seen for shorter alleles. We use these empirical observations to build a model that we apply to individuals for whom we have both genome sequence and microsatellite data, allowing us to estimate key parameters of evolution without calibration to the fossil record. We infer that the sequence mutation rate is 1.4-2.3×10(-8) mutations per base pair per generation (90% credible interval) and that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred 3.7-6.6 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2040925848,"The mineralocorticoid receptor, targeted by drugs commonly used to treat hypertension, is generally thought to contribute to hypertension by altering kidney function. Using mice lacking the mineralocorticoid receptor specifically in smooth muscle cells, Iris Jaffe and her colleagues show that it also controls many aspects of vascular aging, including blood vessel tone, and that these vascular effects contribute to the mineralocorticoid receptor's prohypertensive actions. Hypertension is a cardiovascular risk factor present in over two-thirds of people over age 60 in North America; elevated blood pressure correlates with increased risk of heart attack, stroke and progression to heart and kidney failure. Current therapies are insufficient to control blood pressure in almost half of these patients1,2. The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), acting in the kidney, is known to regulate blood pressure through aldosterone binding and stimulation of sodium retention3. However, recent studies support the concept that the MR also has extrarenal actions4,5,6,7 and that defects in sodium handling alone do not fully explain the development of hypertension and associated cardiovascular mortality8,9. We and others have identified functional MR in human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs)10,11, suggesting that vascular MR might directly regulate blood pressure. Here we show that mice with SMC-specific deficiency of the MR have decreased blood pressure as they age without defects in renal sodium handling or vascular structure. Aged mice lacking MR in SMCs (SMC-MR) have reduced vascular myogenic tone, agonist-dependent contraction and expression and activity of L-type calcium channels. Moreover, SMC-MR contributes to angiotensin II–induced vascular oxidative stress, vascular contraction and hypertension. This study identifies a new role for vascular MR in blood pressure control and in vascular aging and supports the emerging hypothesis that vascular tone contributes directly to systemic blood pressure."

https://openalex.org/W1969770915,"The brain contains a highly diversified complement of molecular species of a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin, which, because of its polyunsaturation, can readily undergo oxygenation. Using global lipidomics analysis in experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), we found that TBI was accompanied by oxidative consumption of polyunsaturated cardiolipin and the accumulation of more than 150 new oxygenated molecular species of cardiolipin. RNAi-based manipulations of cardiolipin synthase and cardiolipin levels conferred resistance to mechanical stretch, an in vitro model of traumatic neuronal injury, in primary rat cortical neurons. By applying a brain-permeable mitochondria-targeted electron scavenger, we prevented cardiolipin oxidation in the brain, achieved a substantial reduction in neuronal death both in vitro and in vivo, and markedly reduced behavioral deficits and cortical lesion volume. We conclude that cardiolipin oxygenation generates neuronal death signals and that prevention of it by mitochondria-targeted small molecule inhibitors represents a new target for neuro-drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2061925865,"Maintaining Repression The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays a critical role in gene silencing in metazoans, methylating histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) to generate a repressive chromatin mark. The catalytic subunit E(z)/Ezh2 requires the presence of two other subunits—ESC/EED and Su(z)12—for enzyme activity. Yuan et al. (p. 971 ; see the Perspective by Pirrotta ) show that both a fragment of the histone H3 N-terminal tail, and histone H1 stimulated PRC2 enzyme activity on poor, low-density chromatin substrates, indicating that that PRC2 is regulated by the density and compaction states of chromatin. The histone H3 fragment binds to the Su(z)12 subunit of PRC2 to stimulate E(z)/Ezh2. Local chromatin compaction preceded establishment of histone H3K27 methylation indicating how PRC2 might maintain the repressed state."
https://openalex.org/W1999024554,"Mutations of the cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) and netrin-G1 (NTNG1) genes cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with clinical features that are closely related to Rett syndrome, including intellectual disability, early-onset intractable epilepsy and autism. We report here that CDKL5 is localized at excitatory synapses and contributes to correct dendritic spine structure and synapse activity. To exert this role, CDKL5 binds and phosphorylates the cell adhesion molecule NGL-1. This phosphorylation event ensures a stable association between NGL-1 and PSD95. Accordingly, phospho-mutant NGL-1 is unable to induce synaptic contacts whereas its phospho-mimetic form binds PSD95 more efficiently and partially rescues the CDKL5-specific spine defects. Interestingly, similarly to rodent neurons, iPSC-derived neurons from patients with CDKL5 mutations exhibit aberrant dendritic spines, thus suggesting a common function of CDKL5 in mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W1989043763,"Transcription Around the Clock The biological clock that controls daily rhythms in mammalian physiology and behavior is thought to be regulated in large part by transcriptional events (see the Perspective by Doherty and Kay ). Koike et al. (p. 349 ; published online 30 August) produced a comprehensive analysis of these transcriptional events across the entire mouse liver genome over a 24-hour period. Only ∼22% of cycling messenger RNA transcripts were driven by de novo transcription, suggesting that posttranscriptional events also play an important regulatory role in the mammalian clock. Biological timing in organisms can also respond to rhythmic cues from the environment. Morf et al. (p. 379 , published online 23 August) explored how one such cue, cycles in ambient temperature, influence circadian timing in mammalian cells. Cold-inducible RNA–binding protein (CIRP) accumulates when body temperature is low. A systematic search for binding partners of CIRP identified RNA encoding core components of the circadian clock. Loss of CIRP decreased the amplitude of circadian gene expression and cells lacking CIRP adapted more quickly to temperature cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2030071264,"A paramutation is an epigenetic interaction between two alleles of a locus, through which one allele induces a heritable modification in the other allele without modifying the DNA sequence. The paramutated allele itself becomes paramutagenic, that is, capable of epigenetically converting a new paramutable allele. Here we describe a case of paramutation in animals showing long-term transmission over generations. We previously characterized a homology-dependent silencing mechanism referred to as the trans-silencing effect (TSE), involved in P-transposable-element repression in the germ line. We now show that clusters of P-element-derived transgenes that induce strong TSE can convert other homologous transgene clusters incapable of TSE into strong silencers, which transmit the acquired silencing capacity through 50 generations. The paramutation occurs without any need for chromosome pairing between the paramutagenic and the paramutated loci, and is mediated by maternal inheritance of cytoplasm carrying Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) homologous to the transgenes. The repression capacity of the paramutated locus is abolished by a loss-of-function mutation of the aubergine gene involved in piRNA biogenesis, but not by a loss-of-function mutation of the Dicer-2 gene involved in siRNA production. The paramutated cluster, previously producing barely detectable levels of piRNAs, is converted into a stable, strong piRNA-producing locus by the paramutation and becomes fully paramutagenic itself. Our work provides a genetic model for the emergence of piRNA loci, as well as for RNA-mediated trans-generational repression of transposable elements."
https://openalex.org/W2041485433,"The bidirectional movement of intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles, which are composed of motors, IFT-A and IFT-B subcomplexes, and cargoes, is required for the biogenesis and signalling of cilia(1,2). A successful IFT cycle depends on the proper assembly of the massive IFT particle at the ciliary base and its turnaround from anterograde to retrograde transport at the ciliary tip. However, how IFT assembly and turnaround are regulated in vivo remains elusive. From a whole-genome mutagenesis screen in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified two hypomorphic mutations in dyf-2 and bbs-1 as the only mutants showing normal anterograde IFT transport but defective IFT turnaround at the ciliary tip. Further analyses revealed that the BBSome (refs 3, 4), a group of conserved proteins affected in human Bardet-Biedl syndrome(5) (BBS), assembles IFT complexes at the ciliary base, then binds to the anterograde IFT particle in a DYF-2- (an orthologue of human WDR19) and BBS-1-dependent manner, and lastly reaches the ciliary tip to regulate proper IFT recycling. Our results identify the BBSome as the key player regulating IFT assembly and turnaround in cilia."
https://openalex.org/W2007047843,"No mucosal adjuvant formulation is approved for clinical use, even though boosting immunity at sites of pathogen entry should increase the efficacy of nonreplicating vaccines. Wegmann et al. report that polyethyleneimine (PEI) acts as a potent mucosal adjuvant for protein antigens from influenza and herpes simplex virus, protecting mice against otherwise lethal infections. Protection against mucosally transmitted infections probably requires immunity at the site of pathogen entry1, yet there are no mucosal adjuvant formulations licensed for human use. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) represents a family of organic polycations used as nucleic acid transfection reagents in vitro and DNA vaccine delivery vehicles in vivo2,3. Here we show that diverse PEI forms have potent mucosal adjuvant activity for viral subunit glycoprotein antigens. A single intranasal administration of influenza hemagglutinin or herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein D with PEI elicited robust antibody-mediated protection from an otherwise lethal infection, and was superior to existing experimental mucosal adjuvants. PEI formed nanoscale complexes with antigen, which were taken up by antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo, promoted dendritic cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes and induced non-proinflammatory cytokine responses. PEI adjuvanticity required release of host double-stranded DNA that triggered Irf3-dependent signaling. PEI therefore merits further investigation as a mucosal adjuvant for human use."

Using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing, we identified causal mutations in ABCD4, a gene that codes for an ABC transporter, which was previously thought to have peroxisomal localization and function. Our results show that ABCD4 colocalizes with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 and LMBD1, the latter of which is deficient in the cblF defect. Furthermore, we show that mutations altering the putative ATPase domain of ABCD4 affect its function, suggesting that the ATPase activity of ABCD4 may be involved in intracellular processing of vitamin B12."

Previs et al. (p. 1215 , published online 23 August; see the Perspective by Burghardt and Ajtai ) have isolated native myosin thick filaments from transgenic mouse hearts, which retained the spatial distribution of cMyBP-C in the thick filament. Imaging of a single actin filament being propelled along the thick filament showed that the N-terminal 29-kD domain of cMyBP-C slows actomyosin motion in parts of the thick filament corresponding to the C-zones in which the thick filaments are cross-bridged. This effect on actomyosin contractility was tuned by graded phosphorylation of four serines adjacent to the 29-kD domain. The findings may explain the appearance of a cMyBP-C fragment in the serum of patients with cardiac ischemia and why cMyBP-C haploinsufficiency associated with cardiomyopathy patients might trigger a hypertrophic response."

https://openalex.org/W1984881525,"Experience-induced expression of immediate-early gene Arc (also known as Arg3.1) is known to be important for consolidation of memory. Using in vivo longitudinal multiphoton imaging, we found orchestrated activity-dependent expression of Arc in the mouse extrastriate visual cortex in response to a structured visual stimulation. In wild-type mice, the amplitude of the Arc response in individual neurons strongly predicted the probability of reactivation by a subsequent presentation of the same stimulus. In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, this association was markedly disrupted in the cortex, specifically near senile plaques. Neurons in the vicinity of plaques were less likely to respond, but, paradoxically, there were stronger responses in those few neurons around plaques that did respond. To the extent that the orchestrated pattern of Arc expression reflects nervous system responses to and physiological consolidation of behavioral experience, the disruption in Arc patterns reveals plaque-associated interference with neural network integration."
https://openalex.org/W2016761490,"Stellar Explosions Stars that are born with masses greater than eight times that of the Sun end their lives in luminous explosions known as supernovae. Over the past decade, access to improved sky surveys has revealed rare types of supernovae that are much more luminous than any of those that were known before. Gal-Yam (p. 927 ) reviews these superluminous events and groups them into three classes that share common observational and physical characteristics. Gamma-ray bursts are another type of extreme explosive events related to the death of massive stars, which occur once per day somewhere in the universe and produce short-lived bursts of gamma-ray light. Gehrels and Mészáros (p. 932 ) review what has been learned about these events since the launch of NASA's Swift (2004) and Fermi (2008) satellites. The current interpretation is that gamma-ray bursts are related to the formation of black holes. Type Ia supernovae are used as cosmological distance indicators. They are thought to be the result of the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarf stars in binary systems, but the nature of the stellar companion to the white dwarf is still debated. Dilday et al. (p. 942 ) report high-resolution spectroscopy of the supernova PTF 11kx, which was detected on 26 January 2011 by the Palomar Transient Factory survey. The data suggest a red giant star companion whose material got transferred to the white dwarf."

(p. 960 ) describe the evolutionary trajectory underlying the emergence of a class of α-pyrone-bearing metabolites—arabidopyrones—in the model plant Arabidopsis . The first step of the arabidopyrone synthesis pathway is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme neofunctionalized following a recent gene duplication event. This development led to the synthesis of a catechol-substituted substrate, which became a new substrate for a highly conserved extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase. Thus, plants can rapidly assemble a specialized metabolic pathway by substituting a new biological activity into an existing catalytic framework."

Here we blocked the degradation of opioids in peripheral injured tissue to locally augment this physiological system. In rats with hindpaw inflammation, inhibitors of aminopeptidase N (APN; bestatin) or neutral endopeptidase (NEP; thiorphan), and a dual inhibitor, NH2-CH-Ph-P(O)(OH)CH2-CH-CH2Ph(p-Ph)-CONH-CH-CH3-COOH (P8B), were applied to injured paws. Combined bestatin (1.25–5 mg)/thiorphan (0.2–0.8 mg) or P8B (0.0625–1 mg) alone elevated mechanical nociceptive thresholds to 307 and 227% of vehicle-treated controls, respectively. This analgesia was abolished by antibodies to methionine-enkephalin, leucine-enkephalin, and dynorphin A 1–17, by peripherally restricted and by selective μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptor antagonists. Flow cytometry and photospectrometry revealed expression and metabolic activity of APN and NEP on macrophages, granulocytes, and sciatic nerves from inflamed tissue. Radioimmunoassays showed that inhibition of leukocytic APN and NEP by bestatin (5–500 μM)/thiorphan (1–100 μM) combinations or by P8B (1–100 μM) prevented the degradation of enkephalins. Blockade of neuronal peptidases by bestatin (0.5–10 mM)/thiorphan (0.1–5 mM) or by P8B (0.1–10 mM) additionally hindered dynorphin A 1–17 catabolism. Thus, leukocytes and peripheral nerves are important sources of APN and NEP in inflamed tissue, and their blockade promotes peripheral opioid analgesia.—Schreiter, A., Gore, C., Labuz, D., Fournie-Zaluski, M.-C., Roques, B.

https://openalex.org/W2052554181,"The factors underlying vulnerability to alcoholism are largely unknown. We identified in rodents an innate endophenotype predicting individual risk for alcohol-related behaviors that was associated with decreased expression of the neuroplasticity-related polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM). Depletion of PSA-NCAM in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was sufficient to render mice unable to extinguish alcohol seeking, indicating a causal role of naturally occurring variation. These data suggest a mechanism of aberrant prefrontal neuroplasticity that underlies enhanced propensity for inflexible addiction-related behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2023681324,"Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) is essential for the production of reduced vitamin K that is required for modification of vitamin K-dependent proteins. Three- and four-transmembrane domain (TMD) topology models have been proposed for VKOR. They are based on in vitro glycosylation mapping of the human enzyme and the crystal structure of a bacterial (Synechococcus) homologue, respectively. These two models place the functionally disputed conserved loop cysteines, Cys-43 and Cys-51, on different sides of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. In this study, we fused green fluorescent protein to the N or C terminus of human VKOR, expressed these fusions in HEK293 cells, and examined their topologies by fluorescence protease protection assays. Our results show that the N terminus of VKOR resides in the ER lumen, whereas its C terminus is in the cytoplasm. Selective modification of cysteines by polyethylene glycol maleimide confirms the cytoplasmic location of the conserved loop cysteines. Both results support a three-TMD model of VKOR. Interestingly, human VKOR can be changed to a four-TMD molecule by mutating the charged residues flanking the first TMD. Cell-based activity assays show that this four-TMD molecule is fully active. Furthermore, the conserved loop cysteines, which are essential for intramolecular electron transfer in the bacterial VKOR homologue, are not required for human VKOR whether they are located in the cytoplasm (three-TMD molecule) or the ER lumen (four-TMD molecule). Our results confirm that human VKOR is a three-TMD protein. Moreover, the conserved loop cysteines apparently play different roles in human VKOR and in its bacterial homologues.

https://openalex.org/W2002797905,"The vast majority of known non-accreting neutron stars (NSs) are rotation-powered radio and/or gamma-ray pulsars. So far, their multiwavelength spectra have all been described satisfactorily by thermal and non-thermal continuum models, with no spectral lines. Spectral features have, however, been found in a handful of exotic NSs and thought to be a manifestation of their unique traits. Here we report the detection of absorption features in the X-ray spectrum of an ordinary rotation-powered radio pulsar, J1740+1000. Our findings bridge the gap between the spectra of pulsars and other, more exotic, NSs, suggesting that the features are more common in the NS spectra than they have been thought so far."
https://openalex.org/W2069941614,"Meprinα, an astacin-type metalloprotease is overexpressed in colorectal cancer cells and is secreted in a non-polarized fashion, leading to the accumulation of meprinα in the tumor stroma. The transition from normal colonocytes to colorectal cancer correlates with increased meprinα activity at primary tumor sites. A role for meprinα in invasion and metastatic dissemination is supported by its pro-angiogenic and pro-migratory activity. In the present study, we provide evidence for a meprinα-mediated transactivation of the EGFR signaling pathway and suggest that this mechanism is involved in colorectal cancer progression. Using alkaline phosphatase-tagged EGFR ligands and an ELISA assay, we demonstrate that meprinα is capable of shedding epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) from the plasma membrane. Shedding was abrogated using actinonin, an inhibitor for meprinα. The physiological effects of meprinα-mediated shedding of EGF and TGFα were investigated with human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). Proteolytically active meprinα leads to an increase in EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and subsequently enhances cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, the implication of meprinα in the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway indicates a role of meprinα in colorectal cancer progression.

https://openalex.org/W2031143033,"BMP Signaling and Transcription Bone morphogenetic protein signaling (BMP) is widely used for dorsoventral axis determination in animal embryos, which involves specific interactions between BMPs and their antagonists. In the genomes of many animals, the gene Pinhead is encoded as a neighbor of one of the BMP ligand genes, Admp (antidorsalizing morphogenetic protein). Working in ascidian tailbud-stage embryos, Imai et al. (p. 964 ) now show that Pinhead is an antagonist of ADMP and is important for the establishment of the sharp boundary of the ventral epidermis. Transcription of Pinhead disturbs transcription of Admp by a cis -acting mechanism, which may explain the mutually exclusive expression of these two functionally opposed genes."
https://openalex.org/W2135230520,"The loading of antigen-derived peptides onto MHC class I molecules for presentation to cytotoxic T cells is a key process in adaptive immune defense. Loading of MHC I is achieved by a sophisticated machinery, the peptide-loading complex (PLC), which is organized around the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) with the help of several auxiliary proteins. As an essential adapter protein recruiting MHC I molecules to TAP, tapasin catalyzes peptide loading of MHC I. However, the exact stoichiometry and basic molecular architecture of TAP and tapasin within the PLC remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that two tapasin molecules are assembled in the PLC, with one tapasin bound to each TAP subunit. However, one tapasin molecule bound either to TAP1 or TAP2 is sufficient for efficient MHC I antigen presentation. By specifically blocking the interaction between tapasin-MHC I complexes and the translocation complex TAP, the MHC I surface expression is impaired to the same extent as with soluble tapasin. Thus, the proximity of the peptide supplier TAP to the acceptor MHC I is crucial for antigen processing. In summary, the human PLC consists maximally of 2× tapasin-ERp57/MHC I per TAP complex, but one tapasin-ERp57/MHC I in the PLC is essential and sufficient for antigen processing.—Hulpke, S., Baldauf, C., Tampé, R.
