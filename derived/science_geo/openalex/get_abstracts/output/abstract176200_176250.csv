https://openalex.org/W2133891056,"When presented with a gradient of chemoattractant, many eukaryotic cells respond with polarized accumulation of the phospholipid PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3). This lipid asymmetry is one of the earliest readouts of polarity in neutrophils, Dictyostelium discoideum and fibroblasts. However, the mechanisms that regulate PtdInsP(3) polarization are not well understood. Using a cationic lipid shuttling system, we have delivered exogenous PtdInsP(3) to neutrophils. Exogenous PtdInsP(3) elicits accumulation of endogenous PtdInsP(3) in a positive feedback loop that requires endogenous phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases (PI(3)Ks) and Rho family GTPases. This feedback loop is important for establishing PtdInsP(3) polarity in response to both chemoattractant and to exogenous PtdInsP(3); it may function through a self-organizing pattern formation system. Emergent properties of positive and negative regulatory links between PtdInsP(3) and Rho family GTPases may constitute a broadly conserved module for the establishment of cell polarity during eukaryotic chemotaxis."

https://openalex.org/W1987726916,Migration of neuronal precursor cells from the external germinal layer (EGL) to the internal granular layer (IGL) is a crucial process in the development of the mammalian cerebellar cortex. These cells make up the only precursor population known to migrate away from the surface of the brain. We studied the role of the chemokine stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in the cerebellar tissue of rats and knockout mice and found (i) that it functions as an attractive guidance cue for neuronal migration and (ii) that its secretion from non-neuronal meningeal tissue is important for controlling the migration of embryonic EGL cells.
https://openalex.org/W2032233723,"The apoptotic protein tBid is effective in promoting both leakage and lipid mixing in liposomes composed of cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine at a molar ratio of 1:2 in the presence of calcium. When half of the phosphatidylcholine component of these liposomes is replaced with phosphatidylethanolamine, a lipid that promotes negative membrane curvature, the rates of both leakage and lipid mixing caused by tBid are substantially increased. Replacement of cardiolipin with phosphatidylglycerol, a lipid that is structurally similar to cardiolipin but does not promote negative membrane curvature in the presence of calcium, prevents the tBid from promoting leakage. The promotion of leakage by tBid is also inhibited by several substances that promote positive membrane curvature, including lysophosphatidylcholine, tritrpticin, a potent antimicrobial peptide, and cyclosporin A, a known inhibitor of cytochrome crelease from mitochondria. We directly measured the effect of tBid on membrane curvature by 31P NMR. We found that tBid promotes the formation of highly curved non-lamellar phases. All of these data are consistent with the hypothesis that tBid promotes negative curvature, and as a result it destabilizes bilayer membranes. Bcl-XL inhibits leakage and lipid mixing induced by tBid. Bcl-XL is anti-apoptotic. It reduces the promotion of non-bilayer phases by tBid, although by itself Bcl-XL is capable of promoting their formation. Bcl-XL has little effect on liposomal integrity. Our results suggest that the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-XL is not a consequence of its interaction with membranes, but rather with other proteins, such as tBid.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar). Members of this protein family can be either pro-apoptotic, such as tBid, or anti-apoptotic, such as Bcl-XL. Mitochondria play a central role in this process (3Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar, 4Martinou J.C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of apoptosis is the rapid and complete release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol (6Madesh M. Antonsson B. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Hajnoczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5651-5659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). One of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is Bid. Unlike other Bcl-2 proteins that have several domains, Bid has only one BH3 domain. The proteolytic enzymes, the caspases, also play an important role in apoptosis. One of the roles of caspases-8 is to catalyze the cleavage of Bid to a truncated form, tBid (8Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). The tBid is then N-myristoylated, which results in its targeting to mitochondria (11Zha J. Weiler S., Oh, K.J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) where it releases cytochrome c and other proteins from the intermembranous compartment. Cardiolipin is required for the binding of t-Bid to mitochondria (12Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X.S. Wang X.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been demonstrated for the action of tBid. It has been shown that tBid can promote the oligomerization of both Bak (13Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Weiler S., Oh, K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 14Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as Bax (15Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). The oligomerization of Bak and Bax is required for their pro-apoptotic activity (16Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been shown that tBid itself homo-oligomerizes, and this process, without the participation of Bak or Bax, results in the release of cytochrome c (17Grinberg M. Sarig R. Zaltsman Y. Frumkin D. Grammatikakis N. Reuveny E. Gross A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12237-12245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as well as other proteins (18Van Loo G. Demol H. van Gurp M. Hoorelbeke B. Schotte P. Beyaert R. Zhivotovsky B. Gevaert K. Declercq W. Vandekerckhove J. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) from mitochondria. In addition, it has been observed that tBid promotes leakage in model membranes in the absence of other proteins (19Zhai D. Miao Q. Xin X. Yang F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,20Kudla G. Montessuit S. Eskes R. Berrier C. Martinou J.C. Ghazi A. Antonsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22713-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A physical property of the membrane that will contribute to its stability is the intrinsic curvature of its constituent monolayers (21Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Cell membranes are essentially flat structures on a molecular scale. However, each monolayer of the bilayer may have greater stability after acquiring is certain degree of curvature. Minimum curvature energy will be reached when the monolayer bends to shape equal to its intrinsic curvature. When a bilayer has a large intrinsic negative monolayer curvature, it will spontaneously convert from a flat structure to an inverted phase, such as the hexagonal phase. In the hexagonal phase the phospholipids are arranged as cylinders with an aqueous core. The cylinders are packed with hexagonal symmetry, and the phospholipids are oriented with their headgroups adjacent to the aqueous core. Membrane monolayer curvature may have particular importance in relation to the functioning of mitochondria. It is known that mitochondrial lipids will convert from a lamellar to a hexagonal phase in the presence of Ca+2 (22Nicolay K. van der, N. R. Fok J.J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 819: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Hope M.J. Nayar R. Rietveld A. Verkleij A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 600: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Freeze fracture electron microscopy has also demonstrated the presence of non-bilayer structures in intact mitochondria (24Van Venetie R. Verkleij A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 692: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The propensity of the mitochondrial membrane to form hexagonal phases has been suggested to modulate the movement of calcium through the membrane (25Wolkowicz P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 232: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as well as the activity of certain mitochondrial enzymes (26Li L. Zheng L.X. Yang F.Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 76: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is known that cytochrome c itself will induce the formation of the hexagonal phase in bilayers of cardiolipin (27de Kruijff B. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 602: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), one of the major lipid components of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In addition to the release of cytochrome c across the outer mitochondrial membrane, it is also found that tBid induces a striking remodeling of mitochondrial structure with a mobilization of about 85% of the cytochrome c stores in cristae (28Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). During this process, individual cristae become fused and the junctions between the cristae and the intermembrane space are opened. The morphological reorganization of mitochondria may also be related to the propensity of the membrane to form inverted phases. It has been shown that the membranes of mitochondria of amoeba form structures resembling a lipidic cubic phase, a structure formed by membranes with negative curvature propensity (29Anderson D.M. Gruner S.M. Leibler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5364-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The morphological reorganization of mitochondria observed during apoptosis is inhibited by cyclosporin A (28Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), a peptide that has been shown to inhibit membrane processes requiring increased negative curvature (30Epand R.M. Epand R.F. McKenzie R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1526-1529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ceramides, a class of lipids that promotes negative curvature (31Montes L.R. Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Goni F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11788-11794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), cause the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria (32Arora A.S. Jones B.J. Patel T.C. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 33Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6660-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 34Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O. Schenk U. Pruschy M. Rocha S. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6080-6084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Ceramides have also been recently shown to form stable conductance channels in membrane bilayers (35Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Together these observations are highly suggestive that monolayer curvature properties modulate mitochondrial function and that increased negative membrane curvature is associated with apoptosis. There are several ways by which the promotion of leakage can be related to intrinsic monolayer curvature. There is evidence for the formation of a highly curved, non-lamellar phase in mitochondria, i.e.the cubic phase (36Deng Y. Marko M. Buttle K.F. Leith A. Mieczkowski M. Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An even more highly curved lipid phase is the hexagonal phase. Formation of this phase will completely break down the permeability barrier of the mitochondria. This is a rather extreme consequence and would result in the release of all materials from the mitochondria. However, even without undergoing a phase transition, simply a change in the propensity to form a phase with a highly curved morphology would be sufficient to destabilize the bilayer and allow more rapid release of mitochondrial contents. This leakage would occur, as has been observed with tBid (20Kudla G. Montessuit S. Eskes R. Berrier C. Martinou J.C. Ghazi A. Antonsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22713-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), without the formation of channels. Alternatively, leakage may occur through a protein pore whose formation or transport activity could be increased by greater intrinsic negative curvature in the bilayer. Such curvature modulation of transport has been observed, for example, with the ionophores alamethicin (37Keller S.L. Bezrukov S.M. Gruner S.M. Tate M.W. Vodyanoy I. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 23-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and gramicidin (38Nielsen C. Andersen O.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2583-2604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cardiolipin may be important for the actions of Bcl-2 proteins and their relationship to membrane curvature. When the negative charge of this lipid is neutralized by Ca2+, the lipid readily converts from a bilayer to a highly curved non-bilayer phase, the hexagonal phase (39Rand R.P. Sengupta S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 255: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Bax and Bak promote the movement of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria (40Nutt L.K. Pataer A. Pahler J. Fang B. Roth J. McConkey D.J. Swisher S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9219-9225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 41Nutt L.K. Chandra J. Pataer A. Fang B. Roth J.A. Swisher S.G. O'Neil R.G. McConkey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20301-20308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, cardiolipin may be important for the binding of certain Bcl-2 proteins, as has been suggested for tBid (12Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X.S. Wang X.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, cardiolipin is a lipid component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, whereas Bcl-2 proteins bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane (15Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, cardiolipin may interact with the Bcl-2 proteins as a consequence of protein-promoted lipid transfer. Increased rates of lipid transfer have been shown with both Bid and tBid (42Esposti M.D. Erler J.T. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7268-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). There is evidence that components of the permeability transition pore reside at contact points between the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria (43Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). It has been shown that tBid also localizes to mitochondria at these contact sites (44Lutter M. Perkins G.A. Wang X. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The marked morphological changes in mitochondria that are induced by tBid strongly suggest that the inner mitochondrial membrane is also involved in the apoptotic action of this protein (28Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). We have further elucidated how tBid interacts with membranes and how the lipid composition of membranes affects the actions of this protein. We have studied the leakage of vesicle contents, a process related to the release of proteins such as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from the intermembrane space. We have also measured the promotion of lipid mixing induced by tBid, a process that may be similar to that which allows lipids from the inner mitochondrial membrane to transfer to the outer membrane. Leakage and lipid mixing are two functional manifestations of membrane destabilization, and the extent of one of these processes may be altered at the expense of the other (45Polozov I.V. Polozova A.I. Tytler E.M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Woolley G.A. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9237-9245Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The liposomes we used in this study contained cardiolipin and the stability of the cardiolipin-containing bilayer was decreased by the addition of calcium. We evaluated the role of the intrinsic curvature properties of the liposome by substituting phosphatidylcholine (PC),1 a lipid that forms stable bilayers, for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a lipid that promotes negative intrinsic monolayer curvature. Insertion of a protein that promotes negative curvature should be more disruptive to a bilayer that already has a negative curvature tendency because of the presence of PE. We also measured effects of tBid on intrinsic membrane curvature by directly monitoring the modulation of the polymorphism of a lipid mixture, using 31P NMR. The shape of the 31P NMR spectrum is known to be different for lipids in the lamellar phase and in non-bilayer phases such as the inverted hexagonal phase (46Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 513: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As the temperature is increased the acyl chains of phospholipids in bilayers will acquire increased splay. This will increase the negative curvature tendency of the membrane, and, at sufficiently high temperature, this will convert the lipid to the hexagonal phase. We measured the modulation of the relative amounts of bilayer and hexagonal phases by tBid as a function of temperature as well as a function of lipid to protein ratio. In addition, we present evidence that several agents that promote positive curvature inhibit tBid-promoted vesicle leakage as well as the release of cytochromec from isolated mitochondria. Caspase-8-cut Bid (tBid) was obtained from purified full-length Bid as described in a previous study (15Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). The resulting N- and C-terminal fragments were not separated. It has been found that the mixture of the two fragments has comparable activity to the isolated C-terminal fragment (20Kudla G. Montessuit S. Eskes R. Berrier C. Martinou J.C. Ghazi A. Antonsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22713-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A 10-fold excess of the N-terminal is required to inhibit the action of the C-terminal fragment in the presence of membranes. tBid was kept as a stock solutions in 15% glycerol with 0.5 mm EDTA. Bcl-XL was prepared as previously described (47Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The stock solutions of Bcl-XL were in 30% glycerol. The tritrpticin was a synthetic product purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and obtained from Professor Vogel at the University of Calgary. Cyclosporin A was purchased from Sigma Chemical Corp (St. Louis, MO). All lipids, including the fluorescently labeled lipids, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The cardiolipin was a synthetic tetraoleoyl form and the lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was the 1-palmitoyl form. Lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol, 2/1 (v/v) at the desired molar ratio. The lipid was deposited as a film on the wall of a glass test tube by solvent evaporation with nitrogen. Final traces of solvent were removed for 2–3 h in a vacuum chamber attached to a liquid nitrogen trap. The lipid films were suspended in the appropriate buffer by vortexing at room temperature to form multilamellar vesicles (MLV). The lipid suspensions were further processed with 5 cycles of freezing and thawing, followed by 10 passes through two stacked 0.1-μm polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore Filtration Products, Pleasanton, CA) in a barrel extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, BC), at room temperature. LUVs were kept in ice and used within a few hours of preparation. Aqueous content leakage from liposomes was determined using the ANTS-DPX assay (48Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Lipid films were hydrated with 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mmDPX, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The osmolarity of this solution was adjusted to be equal to that of the buffer (50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) as measured with a cryo-osmometer (Advanced Model 3MOplus Micro-Osmometer, Advanced Instruments Inc., Norwood, MA). LUVs of 0.1-μm diameter were prepared by extrusion as described above. After passage through a 2.5- × 20-cm column of Sephadex G-75, the void volume fractions were collected and the phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphate analysis. The fluorescence measurements were performed in 2 ml of buffer in a quartz cuvette equilibrated at 37 °C with stirring. Aliquots of LUVs were added to the cuvette to a final lipid concentration of 50 μm, and the fluorescence was recorded as a function of time using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm with 8-nm bandwidths. A 490-nm cutoff filter was placed in the emission path. One of the proteins in buffer was added to the lipid vesicles in the cuvette to give a final protein concentration in the cuvette of 20 nm. Leakage was initiated with the addition of several microliters of a 1 m CaCl2solution in buffer. The amount of Ca2+ added was chosen so as to cause only slow leakage from the LUV alone. The potentiation or inhibition of leakage caused by the proteins was measured over several minutes. The value for 100% leakage was obtained by adding 20 μl of a 10% Triton X-100 solution to the cuvette. Runs were done in duplicate. The LUVs were composed of DOPC:cardiolipin (2:1) or DOPC:DOPE:cardiolipin (1:1:1). The solution of tBid contained glycerol, but appropriate controls demonstrated that the glycerol had no effect on leakage at the final concentrations used in the assays. The resonance energy transfer assay of Struck et al. (49Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) was used to monitor membrane fusion. LUVs were prepared containing either DOPC:cardiolipin (2:1) or a mixture of equimolar amounts of DOPC:DOPE:cardiolipin. For each of these lipid systems two populations of LUVs were prepared, one unlabeled and one labeled with 2 mol% each of N-Rh-PE and N-NBD-PE. A 9:1 molar ratio of unlabeled to labeled liposomes was used in the assay. Fluorescence was recorded at excitation and emission wavelengths of 465 and 595 nm, respectively, using a 490-nm cut-off filter placed between the cuvette and the emission monochromator, with 8-nm bandwidths, using an SLM Aminco Bowman AB-2 spectrofluorometer. Siliconized glass cuvettes (1 cm2) were used with continuous stirring in a thermostatted cuvette holder. Measurements were carried out using a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7.5. LUVs at a final lipid concentration of 50 μm were added to 2 ml of buffer in the cuvette at 37 °C, and then the protein was injected to give a final concentration of 20 nm. Lipid mixing was initiated by addition of the indicated amount of CaCl2solution. The amount of Ca2+ added was such that it caused only a slow rate of lipid mixing with the LUV alone. The effect of the proteins on the rate of lipid mixing was monitored. Fluorescence was recorded for several minutes, and then 20 μl of 10% Triton X-100 was added (final concentration, 0.1%). The initial residual fluorescence intensity, prior to addition of calcium, Fo, was taken as zero. The maximum fluorescence intensity,Fmax, was obtained by dilution of the labeled lipids with 20 μl of 10% Triton X-100. Percent lipid mixing at timet is given by: [(Ft −Fo)/(Fmax −Fo)] × 100. All runs were done in duplicate and were found to be in close agreement. Appropriate controls were done that demonstrated that the glycerol that was present in the stock solution of tBid had no effect on lipid mixing at the final concentrations used in the assays. A dried lipid, prepared as described above, was hydrated by suspending in buffer by vortexing at room temperature, followed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. An aliquot of MLVs was then taken into buffer or protein solution containing calcium. These mixtures were freeze-thawed three times and then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 150 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was removed and assayed for protein. The concentration of phospholipid was determined by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate released after digestion by the method of Ames (50Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). The concentration of protein was determined by the CBQCA assay (Molecular Probes) and read after 3 h of incubation at room temperature, in a 96-well plate with a SpectraMax microplate spectrofluorometer equipped with SOFTmax Pro software. Appropriate lipid controls were carried out for all assays. The 31P NMR spectra were measured using suspensions containing 5 mg of a mixture of DOPE:DOPC:cardiolipin (1:1:1). The lipid mixture was first deposited as a film from a solution in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) as described above for the preparation of LUVs. The lipid film was hydrated by vortexing with 25 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7.5 in the absence or presence of tBid and/or Bcl-XL. After the lipid was suspended at room temperature, a small volume of CaCl2 solution was added to make the calcium concentration 10 mm. The suspension was then frozen and thawed three times to assure equilibration, and the sample was loaded into a 5-mm diameter Shigemi NMR tube (Shigemi Co., Tokyo, Japan). Controls with lipid alone showed that glycerol had no effect on the lipid polymorphism. Spectra were obtained using a Bruker AM-500 spectrometer operating at 202.45 MHz in a 10-mm broadband probe over a 30-kHz sweep width in 16 × 1024 data points. A 90° pulse width of 16.6 μs was used. Composite pulse decoupling was used to remove any proton coupling. Generally, 800 free induction decays were processed using an exponential line broadening of 100 Hz prior to Fourier transformation. Probe temperature was maintained to ±0.2 °C by a Bruker B-VT 1000 variable temperature unit. Temperatures were monitored with a calibrated thermocouple probe placed in the cavity of the NMR magnet. Mitochondria from HeLa cells have been prepared by differential centrifugation as previously described (51Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (30 μg of protein) were incubated with various concentrations of tritrpticin in the presence or absence of 5 μm tBid for 20 min at room temperature in 100 μl of KCl buffer (125 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm phosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mmsuccinate, 15 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4). Mitochondria were then centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g, and both the pellets and supernatants were analyzed for cytochrome c by Western blot. Equal loading of the mitochondrial pellet was verified using an antibody against prohibitin. Leakage of vesicle contents is strongly promoted by tBid (Fig. 1). We have compared the amount of leakage from LUV composed of DOPC:cardiolipin (2:1 molar ratio) with vesicles of DOPC:DOPE:cardiolipin (1:1:1 molar ratio). In both cases, leakage was initiated by the addition of ∼7 mm Ca2+. A calcium concentration was chosen so"

Thus the process of oxidative DNA damage requires only H2O2, free iron, and an as-yet unidentified electron donor that reduces ferric iron to the ferrous state. Previous work showed that H2O2kills Escherichia coli especially rapidly when respiration is inhibited either by cyanide or by genetic defects in respiratory enzymes. In this study we established that these respiratory blocks accelerate the rate of DNA damage. The respiratory blocks did not substantially affect the amounts of intracellular free iron or H2O2, indicating that that they accelerated damage because they increased the availability of the electron donor. The goal of this work was to identify that donor. As expected, the respiratory inhibitors caused a large increase in the amount of intracellular NADH. However, NADH itself was a poor reductant of free iron in vitro. This suggests that in non-respiring cells electrons are transferred from NADH to another carrier that directly reduces the iron. Genetic manipulations of the amounts of intracellular glutathione, NADPH, α-ketoacids, ferredoxin, and thioredoxin indicated that none of these was the direct electron donor. However, cells were protected from cyanide-stimulated DNA damage if they lacked flavin reductase, an enzyme that transfers electrons from NADH to free FAD. The Km value of this enzyme for NADH is much higher than the usual intracellular NADH concentration, which explains why its flux increased when NADH levels rose during respiratory inhibition. Flavins that were reduced by purified flavin reductase rapidly transferred electrons to free iron and drove a DNA-damaging Fenton system in vitro. Thus the rate of oxidative DNA damage can be limited by the rate at which electron donors reduce free iron, and reduced flavins become the predominant donors in E. coli when respiration is blocked. It remains unclear whether flavins or other reductants drive Fenton chemistry in respiring cells.

Molecular oxygen is a triplet species that is constrained to accept electrons one at a time, and its univalent redox potential is low enough that it is unable to abstract electrons from most structural biomolecules. Thus it does not directly oxidize amino acids or nucleic acids. However, it can slowly oxidize the reduced flavins of many redox enzymes, thereby generating a mixture of superoxide (O2O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (1Massey V. Strickland S. Mayhew S.G.

O2O and H2O2 are both stronger oxidants than oxygen, and they can efficiently oxidize iron-sulfur clusters and protein thiols with which oxygen reacts slowly or not at all (4Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar).Still, neither O2O nor H2O2 is a sufficiently potent oxidant to abstract electrons from nucleic acids (8Brawn K.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3023-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Oxidative DNA damage is therefore ascribed to a fourth oxygen species, the hydroxyl radical (HO⋅). The hydroxyl radical is powerful enough to react at diffusion-limited rates with either the base or sugar residues of DNA, leading to base modification and/or strand breakage (Reaction 4, below) (10Hutchinson F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 32: 116-154Google Scholar, 11Aruoma O.I. Halliwell B. Gajewski E. Dizdaroglu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20509-20512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HO⋅ can be formed when H2O2 is univalently reduced by transition metals. In biological systems, the pertinent metal appears to be ferrous iron. The evidence for this conclusion is that cell-permeable iron chelators fully protect intracellular DNA from exogenous H2O2 (12Meneghini R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 13Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutants that are derepressed for iron uptake, and as a consequence contain abnormally high levels of free iron, exhibit high mutation rates and are rapidly killed when they are exposed to H2O2 (14Nascimento A.L.T.O.

The catalytic iron is thought to exist as a small pool of adventitious iron that has dissociated from iron trafficking processes or metalloenzymes. This iron is presumably loosely bound to whatever biomolecules are available, including DNA itself. (Because it is not stably integrated into proteins, this iron is typically referred to as “free” iron.) Because most ferrous chelates are rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen, the existence of a small pool of ferrous iron that is available to react with H2O2 indicates that some countervailing reductive process must continuously re-reduce the free iron. In fact, the efficiency with which exogenous H2O2 damages DNA provides evidence that iron re-reduction must be rapid. When Escherichia coli is treated with 2.5 mm H2O2, DNA damage is generated at a high rate for up to 20 min (13Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). At this concentration of H2O2 the Fenton reaction (76m−1 s−1 (17Walling C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1975; 8: 125-131Crossref Scopus (2747) Google Scholar)) should oxidize pre-existing reduced iron within seconds; the observation that damage occurs steadily indicates that a reductant recycles the iron very efficiently.Thus hydroxyl radicals are created when iron catalyzes the transfer of an electron from a reductant to H2O2. That reductant has not been identified. Superoxide itself is capable of reducing free iron and functions in that capacity in some in vitro Fenton systems (8Brawn K. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 9Lesko S.A. Lorentzen R.J. Ts'o P.O.P.

However, the intracellular concentration of superoxide is so low (∼10−10m) (19Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tyler D.D.

Data. 1985; 14: 1041-1062Crossref Scopus (1800) Google Scholar), that the predicted half-time for this reaction in vivois >10 h, far too long to be physiologically relevant. Although superoxide is mutagenic (22Farr S.B. D'Ari R. Touati D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8268-8272Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), this effect apparently stems from its ability to increase the concentration of free iron by leaching it from unstable iron-sulfur clusters (16Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 23Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Other cellular reductants have been considered. Thiols (∼10−3m), α-ketoacids (∼10−3m), and NAD(P)H (∼10−4m) are all abundant inside cells, and each of these can reduce ferric iron in vitro (24Rowley D.A. Halliwell B.

Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). The rates at which they do so have not been compared, so it is difficult to predict which would be the predominant reductant in vivo.E. coli becomes fully resistant to oxidative DNA damage when it is starved for carbon sources, and sensitivity returns when they are re-administered (27Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This pattern matches the depletion and replenishment of these reductant pools, and it suggests that the availability of a reductant for free iron can determine the rate at which oxidative DNA damage occurs. In fact, when respiration inE. coli was blocked by the addition of cyanide, the rate at which exogenous H2O2 killed cells was dramatically potentiated (26Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2147034765,"Heat shock proteins play central roles in ensuring the correct folding and maturation of cellular proteins. Here we show that the heat shock protein Hsp70 has a novel role in prolonging the lifetime of activated protein kinase C. We identified Hsp70 in a screen for binding partners for the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Hsp70 specifically binds the unphosphorylated turn motif (Thr641 in protein kinase C βII), one of three priming sites phosphorylated during the maturation of protein kinase C family members. The interaction of Hsp70 with protein kinase C can be abolished in vivo by co-expression of fusion proteins encoding the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C or the carboxyl terminus of Hsp70. Pulse-chase experiments reveal that Hsp70 does not regulate the maturation of protein kinase C: the rate of processing by phosphorylation is the same in the presence or absence of disrupting constructs. Rather, Hsp70 prolongs the lifetime of mature protein kinase C; disruption of the interaction promotes the accumulation of matured and then dephosphorylated protein kinase C in the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells. Furthermore, studies with K562 cells reveal that disruption of the interaction with Hsp70 slows the protein kinase C βII-mediated recovery of cells from PMA-induced growth arrest. Last, we show that other members of the AGC superfamily (Akt/protein kinase B and protein kinase A) also bind Hsp70 via their unphosphorylated turn motifs. Our data are consistent with a model in which Hsp70 binds the dephosphorylated carboxyl terminus of mature protein kinase C, thus stabilizing the protein and allowing re-phosphorylation of the enzyme. Disruption of this interaction prevents re-phosphorylation and targets the enzyme for down-regulation. Heat shock proteins play central roles in ensuring the correct folding and maturation of cellular proteins. Here we show that the heat shock protein Hsp70 has a novel role in prolonging the lifetime of activated protein kinase C. We identified Hsp70 in a screen for binding partners for the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Hsp70 specifically binds the unphosphorylated turn motif (Thr641 in protein kinase C βII), one of three priming sites phosphorylated during the maturation of protein kinase C family members. The interaction of Hsp70 with protein kinase C can be abolished in vivo by co-expression of fusion proteins encoding the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C or the carboxyl terminus of Hsp70. Pulse-chase experiments reveal that Hsp70 does not regulate the maturation of protein kinase C: the rate of processing by phosphorylation is the same in the presence or absence of disrupting constructs. Rather, Hsp70 prolongs the lifetime of mature protein kinase C; disruption of the interaction promotes the accumulation of matured and then dephosphorylated protein kinase C in the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells. Furthermore, studies with K562 cells reveal that disruption of the interaction with Hsp70 slows the protein kinase C βII-mediated recovery of cells from PMA-induced growth arrest. Last, we show that other members of the AGC superfamily (Akt/protein kinase B and protein kinase A) also bind Hsp70 via their unphosphorylated turn motifs. Our data are consistent with a model in which Hsp70 binds the dephosphorylated carboxyl terminus of mature protein kinase C, thus stabilizing the protein and allowing re-phosphorylation of the enzyme. Disruption of this interaction prevents re-phosphorylation and targets the enzyme for down-regulation. protein kinase C heat shock protein phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 protein kinase A Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium protein phosphatase 1 hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase peptide-binding domain combined peptide-binding domain and carboxyl terminus The function of signaling proteins is under acute regulation by macromolecular interactions that reversibly modulate their conformation and spatial distribution. These intra- and intermolecular rearrangements can be taxing to the stability of the proteins. Whereas the involvement of heat shock proteins in stabilizing the conformational transitions of newly synthesized proteins is well documented (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar), mechanisms for stabilizing the conformational and structural transitions of mature proteins are less well understood. Protein kinase C (PKC)1serves as a paradigm for a protein under acute structural and spatial regulation: its conformation and its binding partners change continuously during its lifetime in the cell. Specifically, newly synthesized protein associates with the membrane in an open conformation in which its autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence is expelled from the active site (2Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the upstream kinase PDK-1 is docked to the exposed carboxyl terminus (3Gao T. Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the PDK-1 site on the activation loop sequence is accessible for phosphorylation (2Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation of the activation loop sequence, PDK-1 is released from the carboxyl terminus of PKC, thus exposing the carboxyl terminus for two rapid phosphorylations. In the case of conventional PKCs, this phosphorylation occurs by an intramolecular mechanism, underscoring the conformational flexibility of the carboxyl terminus (4Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mature, phosphorylated species is released to the cytosol and the pseudosubstrate gains access to the active site, thus maintaining the enzyme in an autoinhibited state. The enzyme is then activated following receptor-mediated generation of Ca2+ and diacylglycerol. These ligands recruit PKC to membranes by engaging its two membrane-targeting modules on the membrane, an event that provides the energy to expel the pseudosubstrate from the substrate-binding cavity and allow substrate phosphorylation. The membrane-bound, active species adopts an open conformation in which the enzyme is very sensitive to dephosphorylation. Prolonged activation results in significant dephosphorylation, association of the dephosphorylated species with the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells, and eventual down-regulation (5Hansra G. Bornancin F. Whelan R. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32785-32788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Specific protein partners bind to each of the conformational/phosphorylation states of PKC (i.e.unphosphorylated, phosphorylated but inactive, phosphorylated and active, and dephosphorylated). What mechanisms stabilize PKC to the continual structural and spatial re-arrangements? An increasing number of studies suggest that heat shock proteins may play a role not only in protein folding, but also in sustaining the activated state of protein kinases. Most notable is the interaction of Hsp90 with a number of protein kinases, including Src, Raf, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (6Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Richter K. Buchner J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In the case of Src, binding to Hsp90 stabilizes the activity of Src, with studies in yeast indicating that the growth arrest resulting from expression of v-Src is overcome by lowering the level of Hsp90 expressed (8Xu Y. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Similarly, Hsp90 has recently been shown to protect Akt/protein kinase B from dephosphorylation, hence sustaining the active state of Akt and protecting cells from apoptosis (9Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Hsp90 has also been shown to bind directly and stabilize PDK-1, thus prolonging the signaling lifetime of this pivotal kinase (10Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In fact, an increasing number of chaperones are being identified as binding partners for particular protein kinases, including chaperone p32 for protein kinase D (11Storz P. Hausser A. Link G. Dedio J. Ghebrehiwet B. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24601-24607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Hsp90 for the mitogen-activated protein kinase MOP (12Miyata Y. Ikawa Y. Shibuya M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21841-21848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, mounting evidence supports a common mechanism for increasing the lifetime of signaling molecules by direct interaction with molecular chaperones. In this study we identified Hsp70 in a screen for binding partners for the carboxyl terminus of PKC. We show that Hsp70 binding is regulated by the phosphorylation state of the turn motif, one of the two conserved carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites, and that Hsp70 binds mature PKC that has become dephosphorylated, rather than newly synthesized PKC that has yet to be phosphorylated. Functional studies reveal that the interaction of Hsp70 with PKC prolongs the lifetime of active PKC and sustains its function. Hsp70 may generally regulate the function of AGC kinases: we show that the conserved turn motifs of protein kinase A (PKA) and Akt supports Hsp70 binding, apparently by the same phosphoregulated mechanism as PKC.

Similarly, construction of mammalian expression vectors encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of domains of PKCβII (GST-C1, GST-C2, and GST-CD (the catalytic domain), GST-CT (the wild type carboxyl terminus), GST-CT/S660A, GST-CT/S660E, and GST-CT/T641E/S660E (GST-CT/E2)) were described previously (3Gao T. Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the peptide-binding domain (PBD), the carboxyl terminus (CT70), or the combined peptide-binding domain and the carboxyl terminus (PBCT) of Hsp70 were amplified from full-length Hsp70 by PCR. The PCR products were subcloned into pEBG vector (3Gao T. Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to yield in-frame fusions of the various domains to GST (tag at NH2terminus). Carboxyl-terminal Myc-tagged constructs of Hsp70, the ATPase domain, or the PBCT region of Hsp70 were generated from full-length Hsp70 by PCR followed by subcloning of the products into pcDNA3.1Myc/His(−) vector (Invitrogen). TsA201 or COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfection of all cell types was carried out using Effectene transfection reagents (Qiagen). TsA201 cells were transiently transfected with GST-tagged domains of PKCβII or GST-tagged domains of Hsp70. In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with GST-tagged domains and wild-type or specified mutants of PKCβII, Akt, or PKA. The transfected cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm benzamidine, 40 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 300 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The detergent-solublized cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice in buffer A and twice in buffer B (buffer A plus 300 mm NaCl), and proteins bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using chemiluminescence. In some experiments, detergent-solublized lysates from cells expressing PKC, PKA, or Akt were treated with 2 units ml−1 PP1 for 30 min at room temperature to dephosphorylate the turn motif of these kinases (15Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between endogenous Hsp70 and endogenous PKCβII was examined in K562 cells. Cells were lysed in buffer A and the detergent-solublized cell lysate was incubated with an anti-PKCα monoclonal antibody and Ultra-link protein A/G beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in buffer A and twice in buffer B. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using chemiluminescence. COS7 cells were co-transfected with PKCβII and GST vector, GST-CT/S660A, or GST-PBCT. 24–30 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with methionine/cysteine-deficient DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C, as described previously (16Sonnenburg E.D. Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45289-45297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The cells were then pulse-labeled with 1 mCi ml−1[35S]methionine/cysteine in methionine/cysteine-deficient DMEM for 7 min at 37 °C, and chased in chase media (DMEM containing 5 mm unlabeled methionine and 5 mmunlabeled cysteine) for 0, 30, or 60 min. At the indicated times, cells were lysed in buffer A and PKC was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKCα monoclonal antibody (cross-reactive with PKCβII, Transduction Laboratories) coupled to Ultra-link protein A/G beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with buffer B and once with buffer A. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and 35S incorporation detected by autoradiography. K562 cells were seeded at 2–3 × 105 ml−1 and treated with PMA (20 nm) for 2 days. PMA was removed by washing cells three times in growth media, as described (17Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cells were counted using a hemocytometer to establish the baseline number. Cells were then divided into 5 equal groups and plated in 6-well (25 mm) plates. One group of cells was allowed to grow in growth media (control). A second group of cells was grown in the continued presence of PMA. The other three groups of cells were transfected with PKCβII, GST-CT/S660A, or Myc-PBCT. Cell numbers were counted every 24 h for 3 days following transfection. The carboxyl terminus of PKC is required for the function of the enzyme: in addition to stabilizing the mature conformation of PKC by intramolecular interactions, it serves as the docking site for PDK-1 (3Gao T. Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To address whether this regulatory sequence mediates other key protein interactions, we initiated a study to identify binding partners of the carboxyl terminus. A construct of GST fused to the carboxyl-terminal 46 residues of PKCβII (GST-CT) was expressed in tsA2101 cells. Interacting proteins were identified by Coomassie Blue staining of gels from GST pull-down analysis of detergent-solublized cell lysates. A major band migrating at 70 kDa was present in pull-down analysis from cells expressing GST-CT but not GST alone (data not shown). This band was excised from the gel, analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry, and identified as heat shock protein 70. The interaction and specificity of the interaction of Hsp70 with the carboxyl terminus of PKC was confirmed by probing GST pull-downs of various domains of PKC (shown in Fig.1A) expressed in tsA2101 cells with antibodies specific for Hsp70. Fig. 1B (upper panel) shows that endogenous Hsp70 bound constructs containing the carboxyl terminus (GST-CT; lane 2) and the entire catalytic domain (GST-CD; lane 5) of PKC. In contrast, no significant binding was detected to GST alone (lane 1), or fusion proteins of the C1 (GST-C1; lane 3) or C2 domains (GST-C2; lane 4). The level of Hsp70 expression was similar in all samples (lower panel). These results indicate that endogenous Hsp70 interacts with PKCβII in vivo, and that the interaction is mediated by the carboxyl terminus of PKC. We next examined the interaction between endogenous (full-length) PKCβII and endogenous Hsp70. We used K562 cells because of their relatively high levels of endogenous PKCβII (17Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC was immunoprecipitated from the Triton X-100-solublized cell lysate using an anti-PKCα monoclonal antibody that cross-reacts with PKCα and -βII. The upper panel in Fig.2 shows that endogenous Hsp70 was present in immune complexes with PKC (lane 2) but was not present in control samples in which antibody was omitted from precipitations (lane 1). PKCβII in the immunoprecipitates was detected by an anti-PKCβII antibody (lane 2, lower panel). These results show that endogenous PKCβII interacts with endogenous Hsp70 in intact cells. Hsp70 contains three defined functional domains (Fig.3A): a 44-kDa ATPase domain (ATP), an 18-kDa peptide-binding domain (PBD), and a 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal sequence (CT70) (18Kiang J.G. Tsokos G.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). To map the region in Hsp70 that binds PKC, GST fusion constructs of different domains were co-expressed with recombinant PKCβII in tsA201 cells and their interaction with PKC determined by GST pull-down experiments from Triton X-100-solubilized cell lysates. Fig. 3B shows that PKCβII was expressed to similar levels in all samples (lower panel). Western blot analysis of the GST pull-down experiments confirmed the presence of the constructs in the pull-down experiments (middle panel). PKCβII associated with full-length Hsp70 (GST-Hsp70; lane 1), a construct of the peptide-binding and carboxyl-terminal domains (GST-PBCT;lane 2), and a construct of just the peptide-binding domain (GST-PBD; lane 3). No significant binding was detected to a construct of just the carboxyl-terminal sequence (GST-CT70; lane 4). PKCβII did not bind a Myc-tagged construct of the ATPase domain (data not shown). Thus, the peptide-binding domain of Hsp70 contains the primary determinants that mediate the binding of Hsp70 to PKC. The more robust binding to the combined PBCT construct compared with the peptide-binding domain alone revealed some contribution of the carboxyl terminus, possibly by structuring the peptide-binding domain for optimal interaction with PKC, or by directly contributing binding determinants. The PBCT construct was used in subsequent experiments because it binds PKC better than the PBD construct. PKCβII typically migrates as a doublet: the major slower migrating band represents phosphorylated PKC (Fig. 3, double asterisk) and the minor faster migrating band represents unphosphorylated PKC (dash). The PKC that associated with full-length Hsp70 was the unphosphorylated species (upper panel, lane 1); this species represented less than 10% of the total PKC in the lysate (lower panel). These data suggest that the phosphorylation state of PKC is important in the Hsp70 interaction. To further test whether Hsp70 specifically binds unphosphorylated PKCβII, wild-type enzyme and several phosphorylation deficient mutants were co-expressed with a Myc-tagged Hsp70 in tsA201 cells (Fig. 4). The lower panel in Fig. 4 shows the expression of these constructs and their relative electrophoretic mobilities. Wild-type PKCβII migrated primarily as the mature, phosphorylated protein (double asterisk) with a minor amount of unphosphorylated protein (dash) (lane 1), as in Fig. 3. Mutation of the activation loop (T500A3) or turn motif (T641A3) phosphorylation sites, or mutation to render PKC catalytically inactive (K371R), prevents phosphorylation of PKC and these mutants co-migrate with unphosphorylated PKC (lanes 2, 3, and 6) (2Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutation of the hydrophobic site to Ala (lane 4) or Glu (lane 5) still allows processing of PKC by phosphorylation (13Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), so that these constructs migrate as a major slower migrating species representing fully phosphorylated enzyme and a minor slower migrating species representing unphosphorylated protein. Note that the mobility of the full-phosphorylated S660A (single asterisk) was intermediate between that of full-phosphorylated (double asterisk) and completely unphosphorylated (dash) wild-type enzyme because one of the phosphorylation sites is occupied by Ala; conversely, the mobility of the unphosphorylated form of S660E is slower (single asterisk) than that of unphosphorylated wild-type enzyme (dash) because a negative charge occupies one of the phosphorylation sites. Note that the minor band migrating above full-phosphorylated PKBβII represents endogenous PKCα (indicated with open arrow). The Myc-tagged Hsp70 was immunoprecipitated from the detergent-solublized lysates of cells expressing PKCβII constructs with an anti-Myc antibody and its presence detected with an anti-Hsp70 antibody (Fig. 4, middle panel). Fig. 4 (upper panel) shows that each construct of PKC was complexed with Hsp70. Importantly, the unphosphorylated species of PKC was enriched by over an order of magnitude in the immune complexes relative to phosphorylated PKC, whereas unphosphorylated protein represented about 10% of the wild-type (lane 1) and S660E (lane 5) PKC in the total cell lysate, it represented over 90% of the PKC in the complex with Hsp70. Unphosphorylated S660E (lane 6; fastest migrating band) was co-precipitated as efficiently as unphosphorylated wild-type enzyme (lane 1) and unphosphorylated S660A (lane 5). Thus, negative charge at the hydrophobic motif does not influence the interaction of Hsp70 with PKC. However, phosphorylated S660A (position indicated withsingle asterisk in the lower panel of Fig. 4) did not interact with Hsp70 (lane 5; only the slowest migrating band is present on the beads); this species of PKC has phosphate on the turn motif but no charge on the hydrophobic motif, indicating that phosphorylation of the turn motif, in contrast to that of the hydrophobic motif, abolishes the interaction with Hsp70. Thus, Hsp70 selectively binds unphosphorylated PKC and in a manner that is sensitive to the charge at the turn motif but not the hydrophobic motif. The above data show that Hsp70 selectively binds unphosphorylated PKC, yet experiments with the S660E mutant showed that this interaction is not sensitive to the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif. This led us to explore whether phosphorylation of the turn motif regulates the interaction of PKC with Hsp70. TsA201 cells were transfected with GST alone (Fig.5, lane 1) or the following fusion constructs of the carboxyl terminus: GST-T641E/S660E in which both turn and hydrophobic sites were mutated to Glu, GST-S660A (lane 3), and GST-S660E (lane 4). GST pull-down experiments showed that the carboxyl-terminal constructs with mutations at Ser660 effectively bound Hsp70, independently of the charge at this position (upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, additional mutation of Thr641to Glu to mimic the phosphate at the turn motif abolished the interaction of the carboxyl terminus with Hsp70 (upper panel, lane 2). This result suggests that phosphorylation at the turn motif (but not hydrophobic) provides an on/off switch for the interaction of Hsp70 with PKC. The turn motif is conserved throughout the AGC family of kinases (19Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), prompting us to explore whether phosphorylation-regulated binding of Hsp70 was conserved among the PKC family and even generally among AGC superfamily members. Specifically, we asked whether three other kinases bind Hsp70: PKCζ, a member of the atypical class of PKC isozymes that is most divergent from the conventional class of which PKCβII is a member; Akt (protein kinase B); and the archetypal AGC family member, PKA. Similar to the PKC family members, Akt and PKA are constitutively phosphorylated at their turn motifs (20Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 21Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Each of these kinases was co-expressed with GST-Hsp70 in tsA201 cells. Detergent-solublized cell lysates were then treated without or with PP1 to dephosphorylate the kinases. Control or phosphatase-treated lysates were then subjected to GST pull-down analysis and the beads were probed for relevant kinases with specific antibodies. Fig. 6A shows that no significant binding of PKCζ, Akt, or PKA was detected in nonphosphatase samples (lane 1). However, significant association of all three kinases was observed in phosphatase-treated samples (lane 2). Thus, Hsp70 selectively binds the dephosphorylated species of these AGC family members. We next addressed whether, as occurs for PKC, phosphorylation of the turn motif is the switch that abolishes Hsp70 binding to Akt and PKA. TsA201 cells were co-transfected with GST-Hsp70 and either wild-type Akt or PKA (which are quantitatively phosphorylated at the turn motif), or the turn motif mutants of each kinase, T450A or S338A, respectively. Hsp70 was pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads and pellets were analyzed for bound kinases using the antibodies for Akt or PKA. Fig.6B shows modest association of both wild-type Akt and PKC (lane 1) with Hsp70. However, mutation of the turn motif to Ala resulted in a dramatic increase in association (lane 2). Thus, similar to its interaction with PKC, Hsp70 binds Akt and PKA via the unphosphorylated turn motif. We next investigated whether the interaction between full-length PKCβII and Hsp70 could be disrupted by overexpression of fusion proteins encoding either the carboxyl terminus of PKC or the PBCT domain of Hsp70. Constructs of the carboxyl terminus of PKC bind PDK-1 and promote the autophosphorylation of PKC (3Gao T. Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To avoid disrupting the interaction with PDK-1, we focused on a construct of the carboxyl terminus that has a mutation that abolishes PDK-1 binding but does not affect Hsp70 binding: a carboxyl-terminal construct with Ser660 (a key PDK-1-docking site) mutated to Ala. TsA201 cells were co-transfected with PKCβII and GST (Fig. 7, lane 1), GST-CT/S660A (lane 2), or GST-PBCT (lane 3). PKC in the detergent-solublized cell lysates was immunoprecipitated and bound Hsp70 was detected with anti-Hsp70 antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2322599576,"SOCS-1 is an inducible SH2-containing inhibitor of Jak kinases and as such can potently suppress cytokine signaling. SOCS-1 deficient mice die within the first three weeks of life from a myeloproliferative disorder driven by excessive interferon signaling. We report here that SOCS-1 inhibits proliferation signals induced by a variety of oncogenes active within the hematopoietic system. Ectopic expression of SOCS-1 abolished proliferation mediated by a constitutively active form of the KIT receptor, TEL-JAK2, and v-ABL, and reduced metastasis from BCR-ABL transformed cells. SOCS-1, however, did not interfere with v-SRC or RASV12 mediated cellular transformation. A mutant form of SOCS-1 unable to bind through its SH2 domain to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins could still inhibit KIT, but not TEL-JAK2, indicating multiple mechanisms for SOCS-1-mediated tumor suppression. We show that the steady state levels of TEL-JAK2 and to a greater extent v-ABL are diminished in the presence of SOCS-1. Lastly, we show that SOCS-1 -/- fibroblasts are more sensitive than wild type fibroblasts to either spontaneous or oncogene-induced transformation. These data suggest that loss-of-function of SOCS-1 may collaborate with a variety of hematopoietic oncogenes to facilitate tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2137926932,"BLM, WRN, and p53 are involved in the homologous DNA recombination pathway. The DNA structure-specific helicases, BLM and WRN, unwind Holliday junctions (HJ), an activity that could suppress inappropriate homologous recombination during DNA replication. Here, we show that purified, recombinant p53 binds to BLM and WRN helicases and attenuates their ability to unwind synthetic HJ in vitro. The p53 248W mutant reduces abilities of both to bind HJ and inhibit helicase activities, whereas the p53 273H mutant loses these abilities. Moreover, full-length p53 and a C-terminal polypeptide (residues 373–383) inhibit the BLM and WRN helicase activities, but phosphorylation at Ser376 or Ser378 completely abolishes this inhibition. Following blockage of DNA replication, Ser15 phospho-p53, BLM, and RAD51 colocalize in nuclear foci at sites likely to contain DNA replication intermediates in cells. Our results are consistent with a novel mechanism for p53-mediated regulation of DNA recombinational repair that involves p53 post-translational modifications and functional protein-protein interactions with BLM and WRN DNA helicases.

We hypothesize that p53 may regulate HR through its modulation of the BLM and WRN helicase activities. In this study, we present the first evidence that p53 modulates the ability of BLM and WRN helicases to disrupt HJ. This property can be altered by modifications to the p53 C terminus at Ser376 or Ser378. These modifications decrease modulation of recombination and abrogate the binding of p53 to BLM. p53-mediated inhibition of BLM or WRN helicase activity apparently occurs through direct binding to these helicases. In addition, we show that p53 colocalizes in vivo with BLM and RAD51 at putative sites of stalled DNA replication forks and HJ in cells arrested in S-phase by aphidicolin (APH). These results indicate a possible physiological mechanism for the regulation of HR by the physical and functional interaction of p53 with the BLM and WRN DNA helicases as well as their DNA substrates.

The product was then purified by separation through a 10% TBE gel, and recovered by electroelution and dialysis. The linear blunt duplex DNA used as the nonspecific competitor was prepared by annealing X12-1 with its complement.

The WRN helicase assay reactions contained 40 mm Tris borate, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of BLM or WRN proteins, and they were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The products were separated by electrophoresis through 10% nondenaturing polyacrylaminde gels at 4 °C and visualized using a PhosphorImager or film autoradiography and quantified using the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Helicase data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). p53·DNA complexes were assembled by incubating 50 ng of DNA in a 50-μl reaction containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl for 20 min at room temperature using a 1:6 molar ratio of HJ DNAs to p53 tetramers. The complexes were fixed with 0.6% glutaraldehyde (v/v) for 10 min at room temperature followed by gel filtration using a 1-ml Bio-Gel A-5m (Bio-Rad) column to remove free protein and fixatives. The samples were prepared for electron microscopy as described previously (34Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were adsorbed to thin carbon foils supported by 400-mesh copper grids in the presence of spermidine, then washed with a water/ethanol series, air dried, and rotary shadowcast with tungsten. The grids were visualized in a Phillips CM12. Images for publication were scanned with a Nikon 4500 AF film scanner and the contrast was adjusted with Adobe Photoshop software. BLM and WRN were diluted to a concentration of 2 nm in carbonate buffer (0.016m Na2CO3, 0.034 mNaHCO3, pH 9.6) and were then used to coat appropriate wells of a 96-well ELISA plate. WT p53 or mutant p53 proteins were incubated at 0–20 nm in a binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 50 mm NaCl) for 30 min at 24 °C. Then, DO-1 and secondary antibodies were added sequentially. Phosphatase substrate (Sigma) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The A405 values, corrected for background with BSA, were expressed as the mean of three independent experiments. Far Western blotting was performed as described by Wu et al.(4Wu L. Davies S.L.

BLM or WRN (200 ng) were run on a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Hybond-ECL filters (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were denatured and incubated with WT or mutant p53 proteins (200 ng/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. Western analysis was then conducted to detect p53 using DO-1 as the primary antibody. Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of p53 proteins was performed as described (35Takenaka I. Morin F. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. J. Biol.

The reactions were stopped by the addition of a peptide PKC inhibitor. The reaction mixture was then incubated in the presence or absence of phosphatase PP1 (0.02 unit). Separate aliquots were analyzed by Western blot or helicase assay. GlutathioneS-transferase fusion p53 protein was produced inEscherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). BLM and WRN proteins were prepared using the TnT quick- coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. In vitro binding assay was done in immunoprecipitation buffer with rotation at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, the samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE and separated by electrophoresis. Cells in 4-well glass chamber slides were cultured with 5 μg/ml APH for 14 h, fixed, and stained, as described (4Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D.

Images were analyzed by Confocal Assistant software or Laser Sharp. Quantitation of nuclear foci was determined from 100 cells for each treatment. Data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Because the helicase activities of BLM and WRN are necessary for the promotion of HJ branch migration (10Constantinou A. Tarsounas M.

This X-junction is a mimic of the HJ. Consistent with previous reports (9Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., J.R. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D.

To test the effect of p53 on BLM or WRN disrupting the X-junction, BLM or WRN were incubated with the X-junction in the presence of PAb421-immunopurified recombinant WT p53 (Fig. 1). WT p53 inhibited the activities of both BLM and WRN to similar extents. At 6 nm concentration, WT p53 inhibited both BLM and WRN helicase activities by about 80%. Two recombinant p53 mutant proteins (248W and 273H) that correspond to hotspot mutants found in human cancer were also tested. The p53 273H lacked this inhibitory activity, whereas the p53 248W mutant protein had less effect (about 50% inhibition) on BLM or WRN activity. In the absence of BLM or WRN, neither WT p53 nor mutants p53 248W and p53 273H showed intrinsic helicase activity (Fig. 1A). To determine whether that inhibition of BLM and WRN helicases by p53 is structure-specific, an M13 28-bp partial duplex DNA substrate was incubated with BLM (6 nm) and increasing amounts of p53 (0, 5, 10, and 20 nm monomer). As shown in Supplemental Materials Fig. 1, p53 did not inhibit BLM unwinding of the M13 partial duplex. Consistent with a previous report that p53 does not inhibit WRN unwinding of a partial duplex substrate (33Brosh Jr., R.M. Karmakar P. Sommers J.A. Yang Q. Wang X.W. Spillare E.A. Harris C.C. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35093-35102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it suggests that inhibition of BLM and WRN helicases by p53 is structure-specific. Recombinant p53 protein produced in baculovirus exists in a tetrameric form and binds to its DNA consensus sites predominantly as a tetramer or as higher molecular weight complexes (36Halazonetis T.D.

Consistent with previous data (10Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C.

One possibility is that a single molecule of BLM binds to the X-junction, whereas WRN and p53 bind to this substrate either in different oligomeric states or at multiple sites on the DNA molecule. Whereas WT p53 bound efficiently to the X-junction, p53 248W bound to a lesser degree, and p53 273H showed no detectable binding activity (Fig. 2A). The shifted bands were competed efficiently by the unlabeled X-junction, but not by double-stranded DNA (blunt ends). The simultaneous addition of both p53 and BLM to EMSA reactions resulted in an increased intensity of the shifted bands with different mobility. The presence of both p53 and BLM in these shifted bands was confirmed by Western blot analysis with either p53 or BLM antibody, indicating the presence of a p53-BLM·X-junction complex (Fig. 2B, bands 7 and 8). Similar results were obtained when WRN and p53 were used on the EMSA analysis. Both proteins were detected in the shifted bands (Fig. 2C). To visualize HJ by electron microscopy, 4-way junctions containing 500-bp arms (Hol575) were constructed as described previously (22Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol.

The Hol575 DNA was incubated with WT p53 as well as p53 248W and p53 273H at room temperature for 20 min. The samples were fixed, processed through Bio-Gel A-5m to remove free proteins and fixatives, and prepared for EM. Examination of the WT p53 complexes with Hol575 showed that a large number of the HJ DNAs had p53 bound at the crossover point (Fig. 3A). The DNA molecules were scored (n = 300) and the results showed that 63% of the HJ had p53 bound somewhere on the DNA. Of these bound molecules, 70% contained p53 at the crossover point, 13% had protein bound along an arm of the HJ, and 17% had p53 at an end of one arm. The p53 248W showed slightly lower binding affinity than the WT p53. Of the molecules scored, 40% of the molecules were bound by p53. In addition, this mutant had lower affinity for the crossover point of the junction. Of the bound molecules counted, only 45% had protein at the crossover junction when compared with 70% in WT p53. The remaining molecules had p53 bound either along the arm or at the termini of the arms. Finally, the p53 273H mutant showed very low binding to the Hol575 template. Only 12% of the DNA molecules were bound by the protein and, more interestingly, none of the bound molecules had p53 at the crossover point. When compared with the WT p53, this mutant not only had reduced binding to DNA, but also had lost the specificity of the crossover point. The E. coli RuvA protein specifically binds to HJ at the crossover junction (41Adams D.E. West S.C. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 42Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Hargreaves D. Artymiuk P.J. Baker P.J. Sharples G.J. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Here, it competed efficiently with WRN or p53 for binding to the X-junction (Fig. 3B). In the presence of a 3-fold excess of WRN or p53 over RuvA, the RuvA·X-junction complex predominated. This indicated that the affinity of WRN and p53 for the X-junction is less than that observed with RuvA. Consistent with a previous report (11Karow J.K. Constantinou A., Li, J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), similar results were seen with BLM (data not shown). These data indicate that p53, BLM, and WRN recognize the DNA crossover of the HJ. Next, we compared the effects of various concentrations of WT, 248W, or 273H p53 for their binding to the X-junction and their inhibition of BLM or WRN helicase activity. WT p53 bound to the X-junction and inhibited the helicase activities of BLM and WRN in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). Binding of the p53 248W to the X-junction and inhibition of BLM and WRN helicase activities were dose-dependent, but the magnitude of the effect was reduced significantly relative to that of WT p53. p53 273H did not significantly bind to the X-junction nor inhibit helicase activity. To determine whether protein-protein interactions were also responsible for p53-mediated modulation of the BLM and WRN helicase activitiesin vivo, cell lysates were prepared from either untreated or irradiated (5 gray) normal lymphoblastoid cells (GM01310). The lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-BLM or anti-WRN antibody. The efficiency of the immunoprecipitation was assessed by analyzing supernatants of the immunoprecipitation and straight loadings of the cell lysates by Western blotting with anti-BLM or anti-WRN antibody. Only about 20% BLM or WRN proteins were immunoprecipitated by these antibodies (data not shown). A dilution series of recombinant p53 was used as a standard for quantification of the amount of cellular p53. p53 increased to 3.3 × 104 molecules/cell 3 h after irradiation (Fig.5A), whereas the amount of BLM was unchanged under these experimental conditions. Assuming that there are 4,000 molecules of BLM/cell (43Sanz M.M. Proytcheva M. Ellis N.A. Holloman W.K. German J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 91: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the ratio of p53 to BLM is about 8:1. Previous studies have suggested that active forms of BLM and p53 are hexameric and tetrameric, respectively (30Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 36Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the maximum calculated percentage of p53 that could be immunoprecipitated by anti-BLM antibodies is ∼12%. We found that about 2% of the cellular p53 was immunoprecipitated by anti-BLM or anti-WRN antibody after exposure to irradiation (Fig. 5B). The efficiency of BLM or WRN immunoprecipitation was only 20%, thus we conclude that approximately 10% of the cellular p53 binds to either BLM or WRN under our conditions. This is close to the theoretical maximum that could be immunoprecipitated by anti-helicase antibodies, indicating that both helicases bind saturating amounts of p53. Because p53 is in large excess, these results indicate that only a fraction of p53 is involved in binding to helicases. Competitive peptides blocked co-immunoprecipitation of p53 with anti-BLM or WRN excluding the possibility that the immunoprecipitation was nonspecific (data not shown). Direct binding of p53 to both BLM and WRN was confirmed by far Western analysis. BLM, WRN, or p53 were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then incubated with WT or mutant p53 proteins. WT p53 and p53 248W exhibited strong binding to BLM or WRN, whereas p53 273H showed weaker, but detectable, binding. BSA was used as a negative control (Fig. 5C). We next analyzed the binding affinities of WT and mutant p53 to BLM and WRN. Using an ELISA, WT p53 and p53 248W bound in a dose-dependent manner, and with similar affinities, to both BLM and WRN. In contrast, p53 273H showed a relatively weak level of binding to either BLM or WRN (Fig. 5D). The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by the absence of detectable signals in wells that had been precoated with BSA only (data not shown). The p53 C terminus is required for binding to both BLM or WRN (26Blander G. Kipnis J. Leal J.F., Yu, C.E. Schel"
https://openalex.org/W2032824516,"Nitric oxide (NO) signal transduction may involve at least two targets: the guanylyl cyclase-coupled NO receptor (NOGCR), which catalyzes cGMP formation, and cytochrome c oxidase, which is responsible for mitochondrial O2 consumption and which is inhibited by NO in competition with O2. Current evidence indicates that the two targets may be similarly sensitive to NO, but quantitative comparison has been difficult because of an inability to administer NO in known, constant concentrations. We addressed this deficiency and found that purified NOGCR was about 100-fold more sensitive to NO than reported previously, 50% of maximal activity requiring only 4 nm NO. Conversely, at physiological O2concentrations (20–30 μm), mitochondrial respiration was 2–10-fold less sensitive to NO than estimated beforehand. The two concentration-response curves showed minimal overlap. Accordingly, an NO concentration maximally active on the NOGCR (20 nm) inhibited respiration only when the O2concentration was pathologically low (50% inhibition at 5 μm O2). Studies on brain slices under conditions of maximal stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis suggested that the local NO concentration did not rise above 4 nm. It is concluded that under physiological conditions, at least in brain, NO is constrained to target the NOGCR without inhibiting mitochondrial respiration.

NO can also be cytotoxic and has been incriminated in many different pathologies, including atherosclerosis, septic shock, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders (1Hobbs A.J. Higgs A. Moncada S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Although much has been learned about the mechanism of NO synthesis (2Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), the transduction pathways engaged by physiological NO signals to modify cell and tissue function remain to be clearly defined. The established target is the guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptor, or NOGCR, 2For historical reasons, this protein has been called “soluble guanylyl cyclase,” but this name is now considered inappropriate (29Zabel U. Kleinschnitz C., Oh, P. Nedvetsky P. Smolenski A. Muller H. Kronich P. Kugler P. Walter U. Schnitzer J.E. Schmidt H.H. Nat.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44647-44652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The nomenclature adopted here is consistent with that used for other receptors. which exists in at least two different heterodimeric isoforms (α1β1 and α2β1). This is a metabotropic type of receptor equipped with a heme prosthetic group to which NO binds, triggering the formation of cGMP from GTP in the cyclase domain of the protein. Through this route, NO elicits many effects such as smooth muscle relaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and synaptic plasticity (3Koesling D. Friebe A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 41-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the NO concentrations that engage the NOGCR is important for understanding the receptor kinetics, for informing on the physiological NO concentrations likely to exist in tissues, and for developing realistic models of NO signaling. Currently, however, the information on this issue is incoherent. Studies on the purified α1β1 receptor protein have suggested that the NO concentration giving half-maximal activation (the EC50) is 250 nm (5Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). More recently, an EC50 of 1.6 μm has been obtained for the enzyme in an extract of rat aorta (6Artz J.D. Toader V. Zavorin S.I. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9256-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The validity of this range appears to be supported by several studies that have used the NONOate, diethylamine/NO adduct (DEA/NO), which degrades to release NO with a half-life of 2.1 min (at 37 °C). Typically the EC50 of DEA/NO in standard assays of NOGCR activity is about 300 nm (7Schrammel A. Behrends S. Schmidt K. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar, 8Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and this has been assumed to approximate the potency of NO (8Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Russwurm M. Mergia E. Mullershausen F. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24883-24888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to these estimates made on the purified protein or in cell-free extracts, the estimated EC50 value for NOGCR activation by NO in intact cells from the brain ranges from 20 to 45 nm (10Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4287-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) down to 2 nm (11Griffiths C. Garthwaite J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 855-862Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Despite the variability on both sides, this comparison might suggest that, along with other functional differences, the NOGCR in intact cells possesses heightened sensitivity to NO (12Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Another putative target for NO is cytochrome c oxidase, which is the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain responsible for almost all cellular O2 consumption. By competing with O2 for binding to cytochrome coxidase, NO is considered to regulate the rate of respiration and the tissue distribution of O2 (13Moncada S. Erusalimsky J.D. Nature Revs. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 14Cooper C.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 33-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Brown G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 16Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ensuing inhibition of respiration, and thus, of ATP synthesis, could have pathological repercussions, particularly in tissues such as brain that rely almost entirely on oxidative phosphorylation to meet their energy requirements (17Erecinska M. Silver I.A. Respir. Physiol. 2001; 128: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). An important consideration here is the NO concentration range that is active on cytochrome c oxidase relative to that which engages the NOGCR. Under physiological conditions (30 μm O2), the NO concentration required to achieve 50% inhibition of respiration (the IC50) has been estimated to be 60 nm in brain synaptosomes (18Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) and 11 nm in isolated mitochondria (19Koivisto A. Matthias A. Bronnikov G. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Hence, depending on which pairs of values are taken, concomitant activation of the NOGCR and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration would appear inevitable, or at least plausible. Aside from the problems of variability in the published estimates of the apparent potency of NO toward both these targets, another pertinent issue is that, to determine the true potency of any agonist on its receptor, it is a prerequisite that the agonist be applied in known concentrations that are stable over the period of measurement. Because of the instability of NO in aerobic solutions, particularly in the hyperoxic solutions used in the laboratory, this has not been achieved for either target, raising further uncertainty about their true sensitivities. By devising a method for delivering known, constant NO concentrations, we address this deficiency and provide a quantitative comparison of the potency of NO for activating purified NOGCR and inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Constant NO concentrations were obtained by allowing a dynamic equilibrium to exist between NO release from a donor and NO inactivation by red blood cells. Red blood cells were prepared from whole rat blood as described (20Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and kept on ice. This stock was diluted to a final concentration of around 2 million cells/ml in either: (a) buffer (pH 7.4) containing NaCl (130 mm), Tris/HCl (50 mm), MgCl2 (3 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for NOGCR experiments or (b) a suspension of cells from the cerebellum (20 million cells/ml), prepared as described previously (10Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4287-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), for determination of the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to NO. The NONOates diethylenetriamine/NO adduct (DETA/NO) and DEA/NO (both from Alexis, Nottingham, UK) were prepared in 10 mm NaOH and diluted 1:100 into the final incubation medium. The NO and O2 concentrations were recorded with a 1-Hz sampling frequency at 37 °C in a sealed, stirred vessel equipped with an electrochemical NO probe (ISO-NOP, World Precision Instruments, Stevenage, UK) and O2 electrode (Rank Brothers, Cambridge, UK). The rate of O2 consumption in the presence of fixed NO concentrations achieved following addition of DETA/NO was measured within the O2 concentration range 20–30 μm. This rate was expressed as a fraction of the control rate measured beforehand within the range 30–40 μm O2. All measurements were adjusted for slight basal drift by deducting the gradient found on adding NaCN (1 mm) as described previously (18Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Purified NOGCR (soluble guanylyl cyclase; Alexis) was diluted in a buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin to give a stock concentration of 5 μg/ml, which was stored on ice. For experiments with clamped NO concentrations, DETA/NO was added to red blood cells incubated at 37 °C at time 0, substrate (1 mm GTP) at 45 s, and NOGCR (final concentration 0.05 μg/ml) after 1 min. Addition of GTP or the receptor protein did not disturb the steady-state NO concentration, as measured by the electrochemical probe. Aliquots of the reaction mix were removed after various times and inactivated in boiling buffer (50 mm Tris, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). For experiments with DEA/NO, NOGCR was added to a buffer containing: Tris/HCl (50 mm), MgCl2 (3 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), GTP (1 mm), dithiothreitol (3 mm), and 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 5 s before addition of DEA/NO. Aliquots were removed and inactivated in boiling buffer. The levels of cGMP in both cases were measured by radioimmunoassay. For determining the activity of the NOGCR in brain tissue, 400 μm thick slices of cerebellum from 8-day-old rats (prepared as in Ref. 21Southam E. East S.J. Garthwaite J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 2072-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were preincubated for ∼2 h in an oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing: NaCl (124 mm), KCl (3 mm), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mm), MgSO4 (1 mm), NaHCO3 (26 mm), CaCl2 (2 mm), andd-glucose (10 mm) at 37 °C. The slices were exposed to DEA/NO in various concentrations or NMDA (in the presence of 100 μml-arginine, added 15 min beforehand), and 2 min later, slices were inactivated in boiling buffer (50 mm Tris, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and then sonicated. The protein content of the homogenate was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method with bovine serum albumin as standard and, following centrifugation, the cGMP content of the supernatant was determined by radioimmunoassay. An apparatus for maintaining constant (clamped) NO concentrations has been designed (22Zhelyaskov V.R. Godwin D.W. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but it is expensive to construct and unsuited to most biological applications. We have found a cheap and simple solution to the problem based on the principle that a fixed NO concentration will be formed when a constant source of NO comes into equilibrium with a “sink” that consumes it. For a source, we used the diethylenetriamine/NO adduct DETA/NO, which decomposes slowly with first order kinetics (a half-life of 20 h at 37 °C), thus releasing NO at an effectively constant rate for many hours. For a sink, we have exploited the ability of oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) when located within red blood cells to consume NO at an appropriate first order rate, forming methemoglobin and nitrate (20Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). When DETA/NO (50–500 μm) was mixed with a suspension of red blood cells (2 million/ml), a fixed concentration of NO was attained within 1 min (Fig. 1a). The amplitude of the steady-state concentration varied faithfully with the rate of NO release so that a linear relationship was observed between the DETA/NO concentration and the steady-state NO concentration (Fig.1b). At the upper extreme (750 μm DETA/NO), the NO sink became exhausted after around 2 min, presumably due to oxyHb oxidation. Thus, the method is capable of producing clamped NO concentrations covering the range 0–75 nm and lasting at least several minutes. This simple reaction mixture was used to test NOGCR sensitivity, but in principle, introduction of an appropriate concentration of red blood cells in suspension into any biological system would enable NO clamping to be achieved. Addition of small volumes (10 μl) of purified NOGCR to this pre-equilibrated mixture (1 ml) in the presence of substrate (GTP) and co-factor (Mg2+) did not affect the NO concentration (not shown). Accordingly, the cGMP resulting from receptor activation accumulated linearly with time and with no visible delay, regardless of NO concentration (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, addition of cGMP showed that the product remained stable in the mixture (Fig.1d). The full concentration-response curve (Fig.2a) had a threshold of ∼0.5 nm, and maximum activity was observed at ∼20 nm. The curve was well described by the Hill equation with an EC50 of 3.9 nm and a Hill constant of 2.1. The high sensitivity of the purified NOGCR to NO found here contrasts with previous measurements variously reporting EC50 values of 250 nm (5Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) or 1.6 μm (6Artz J.D. Toader V. Zavorin S.I. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9256-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), possible reasons for which are discussed later (see “Discussion”). Also apparently conflicting with the present result are several other studies using the NONOate DEA/NO (a half-life of 2.1 min) whose EC50 on the purified NOGCR following a 10-min incubation, about 300 nm (7Schrammel A. Behrends S. Schmidt K. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar, 8Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), has been assumed to correspond to the EC50 for NO (8Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Russwurm M. Mergia E. Mullershausen F. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24883-24888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When we reproduced these conditions, the EC50 for DEA/NO was indeed 300 nm (Fig. 2b). On measuring the profile of NO produced by 300 nm DEA/NO, however, it was found that the concentration peaked at 50 nm after 2 min and then fell below the probe detection limit after 5–6 min (Fig.3a). Therefore, the EC50 for DEA/NO could simply reflect NO being in active concentrations for about half of the measured time. In accordance with this possibility, when the activity was followed over the whole 10-min period, it varied as predicted should the true EC50 for NO be 3.9 nm (Fig. 3a). Thus, cGMP accumulated at the maximal rate for the first 3–4 min, but then the rate progressively decreased as NO fell below 20 nm, falling to 0 after around 6 min, coincident with the disappearance of NO. For this independent (but corroborating) estimate of the EC50 for NO to be valid, the enzyme activity would have to respond in a dynamic manner as the NO concentration falls. If deactivation on removal of NO takes many minutes, as suggested by a study on the purified protein (Ref. 23Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, but see also Refs. 9Russwurm M. Mergia E. Mullershausen F. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24883-24888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and24Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the potency of NO measured by charting the changes in NOGCR activity over time in response to DEA/NO (Fig.3a) would be an overestimate. The deactivation rate was investigated by adding sufficient free oxyHb (10 μm) to remove all free NO. Accumulation of cGMP ceased abruptly on the addition of oxyHb, consistent with deactivation occurring within the ∼0.5 s of mixing time (Fig. 3b) and thereby validating this second estimate of the potency of NO. The O2 consumption of cells from rat brain (cerebellum) was measured in the presence of fixed NO concentrations and at an O2 concentration of between 20 and 30 μm, corresponding to the range typically found in the brain in vivo (17Erecinska M. Silver I.A. Respir. Physiol. 2001; 128: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). As expected, concentration-dependent inhibition was observed, but the IC50 value was about 120 nm(Fig. 4a,b), which is 2–10-fold higher than found in earlier work on brain synaptosomes and isolated mitochondria (18Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 19Koivisto A. Matthias A. Bronnikov G. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As with the NOGCR, the Hill constant was 2, which is in agreement with findings using isolated mitochondria (19Koivisto A. Matthias A. Bronnikov G. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The question was then addressed from a different perspective: how low does the O2 concentration need to be before an NO concentration that is maximally effective on the NOGCR (20 nm) exerts significant respiratory inhibition? For 50% inhibition by 20 nm NO, the O2 concentration needed to fall to 5 μm (Fig. 4c). The foregoing results suggest that the NO concentration would need to be supramaximal for the NOGCR in order to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase significantly under normoxic conditions (Fig. 4d). It could be argued that the two proteins represent distinct high and low affinity targets, but for this hypothesis to be tenable, evidence is needed that the NOGCR can become saturated in response to endogenous NO synthesis. To examine this possibility, NOGCR activity was used as an intrinsic biosensor to provide a readout of the maximal tissue NO concentrations that can be generated endogenously. In brain, neuronal NO synthase activity is coupled to activation of the NMDA type of glutamate receptor (4Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), and this pathway is particularly prominent in the developing cerebellum (21Southam E. East S.J. Garthwaite J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 2072-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Garthwaite J. Charles S.L. Chess Williams R. Nature. 1988; 336: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). On exposure of intact slices of this tissue to a maximally effective concentration of NMDA (300 μm; Ref. 21Southam E. East S.J. Garthwaite J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 2072-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in the presence of a saturating concentration of the NO synthase substrate, l-arginine (100 μm; Ref. 21Southam E. East S.J. Garthwaite J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 2072-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), cGMP rose 200-fold, from 1.9 ± 0.2 pmol/mg of protein to 366 ± 39 pmol/mg of protein (n = 5). To calibrate this response, the slices were exposed to increasing concentrations of exogenous NO, using DEA/NO as the donor. Because of the powerful NO inactivation pathway that is expressed in brain and other tissues, high concentrations of NO donors need to be applied to intact brain slices to supply the cells with active concentrations of free NO (11Griffiths C. Garthwaite J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 855-862Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At the peak of the response to DEA/NO (100 μm; curve not shown), cGMP was 619 ± 33 pmol/mg of protein (n = 5), almost twice the level found with NMDA. The lower response found with NMDA was not because the agonist reduced the responsiveness of the NOGCR (e.g. through raising cytosolic Ca2+; Ref. 26Parkinson S.J. Jovanovic A. Jovanovic S. Wagner F. Terzic A. Waldman S.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) because simultaneous exposure to NMDA failed to inhibit the response to DEA/NO (717 ± 28 pmol/mg of protein; n = 5). Because pharmacological activation of NMDA receptors in this way will lead to the switch-on of multiple NO sources throughout the slice, it follows that sources and sinks will rapidly come to equilibrium generating a steady-state “continuum” of NO throughout the tissue (27Wood J. Garthwaite J. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Visible evidence for the validity of this assumption is provided by immunocytochemical data on cGMP accumulation in NMDA-stimulated cerebellar slices (28de Vente J. Bol J.G.J.M. Berkelmans H.S. Schipper J. Steinbusch H.M.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 845-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Inspection of Fig. 2a suggests, therefore, that maximal endogenous NO synthesis raises the local NO concentration experienced by NOGCR in situ to about 4 nm. By using clamped NO concentrations, we find that NO is about 100-fold more potent as an agonist for the purified NOGCR and 2–10-fold less potent as an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration than reported previously, the net effect being that there is minimal overlap in the two concentration-response curves at physiological O2 concentrations (Fig. 4d). This, together with evidence that the NOGCR is not saturated during maximal endogenous NO synthase activity and that even a saturating NO concentration for the NOGCR only affects respiration when the O2 concentration is very low, signifies that, in the brain at least, the NO signaling pathway has evolved to target the NOGCR without simultaneously influencing mitochondrial function. The explanation for the much higher previous estimates of the potency of NO on the NOGCR in its purified form or in extracts (0.25 and 1.6 μm; Refs. 5Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar and 6Artz J.D. Toader V. Zavorin S.I. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9256-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is not entirely clear, but the NO concentrations were not measured over time, and in one case (5Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), losses occurring through reaction with components of the reaction mixture, such as dithiothreitol and residual O2, presumably exceeded expectations. In the other case (6Artz J.D. Toader V. Zavorin S.I. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9256-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the value of 1.6 μm was derived by summing the NO released by various donors over a 10-min period, disregarding NO loss or degradation altogether. As shown here using DEA/NO, the EC50 value derived in this way is misleading because it measures the donor concentration required to maintain NO in active concentrations for half the incubation period, not the potency of NO on its receptor. It follows that changes (or otherwise) in the EC50 value for the donor cannot alone be taken as evidence for changes (or otherwise) in the sensitivity of the NOGCR. The recent conclusion, made on this basis, that association with membranes “sensitizes” the receptor to NO (29Zabel U. Kleinschnitz C., Oh, P. Nedvetsky P. Smolenski A. Muller H. Kronich P. Kugler P. Walter U. Schnitzer J.E. Schmidt H.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) may therefore be spurious as a lower rate of NO consumption (16Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 30Griffiths C. Yamini B. Hall C. Garthwaite J. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) by membrane fractions as compared with cytosol could account for the differing apparent EC50 values for DEA/NO (0.24 versus 0.48 μm, respectively). On the other hand, the EC50 value measured here for the purified NOGCR (4 nm) is in good agreement with the value of 2 nm estimated for intact brain cells (11Griffiths C. Garthwaite J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 855-862Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), especially considering the large extrapolation involved in arriving at this estimate. Higher EC50 values (20–45 nm) have also been reported for the same cells (10Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4287-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but these relied on assumptions about the efficiency of NO release from a caged precursor, which must be regarded as questionable. Consequently, there are now no good grounds for proposing the existence of cellular factors that enhance the potency of NO on its receptor (12Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in our hands, the rapid rate of deactivation of purified NOGCR (≤0.5 s, Fig. 3b) is consistent with the subsecond deactivation rate measured in intact cells (10Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4287-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the reasons for the much slower rates (from 5 s to 3 min) found for the purified NOGCR in other laboratories (9Russwurm M. Mergia E. Mullershausen F. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24883-24888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and their variability remain uncertain, this finding dissipates the need to invoke the existence of factors in cells that enhance the rate of dissociation of NO from its receptor (9Russwurm M. Mergia E. Mullershausen F. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24883-24888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition to providing a measure of the potency of NO for the NOGCR, the shape of the concentration-response curve is also instructive. The current model of a single binding event to the heme prosthetic group (3Koesling D. Friebe A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 41-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) predicts a Hill slope of 1 (Fig.2b, dashed line), whereas we found that the curve was steeper, with a Hill slope of 2. The most straightforward interpretation of a slope greater than 1 is that the receptor incorporates multiple agonist binding sites that act in a cooperative fashion. This possibility has been raised previously for the NOGCR based on analysis of activation kinetics (31Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), but we have recently argued that these data are equivocal and can be fitted by a simpler model (32Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The shape of the equilibrium concentration-response curve of the NOGCR provides the first unambiguous evidence that a single NO binding event cannot underlie receptor activation. It follows that the simplest model must now incorporate two NO binding events, meaning that the NOGCR can exist in at least four states (unbound, a single NO-bound state, a double NO-bound state, and an active state) and that progressive activation of a population of receptors would proceed in three kinetic phases. Testing the predictions of this new model against existing equilibrium and kinetic data is clearly desirable. In addition to NOGCR activation, there has been growing interest in the possibility that NO could function as a regulator of mitochondrial respiration, based in part on the assumption that at physiological O2 concentrations, cytochromec oxidase would be inhibited by NO concentrations similar to those required for NOGCR activation (13Moncada S. Erusalimsky J.D. Nature Revs. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 14Cooper C.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 33-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Brown G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Our experiments, however, showed that the two concentration-response curves were separated by a factor of 30 and that the IC50 for respiratory inhibition by NO was 2–10-fold higher than previous estimates (18Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 19Koivisto A. Matthias A. Bronnikov G. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The discrepancy probably relates to the former use of bolus-like additions of NO because when the brain cells used here were challenged with boluses of NO (at ∼100 μmO2), the IC50 measured during the subsequent decay of NO (120 nm; Ref. 11Griffiths C. Garthwaite J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 855-862Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) matched that found for isolated mitochondria (also at ∼100 μm O2) using a similar approach (19Koivisto A. Matthias A. Bronnikov G. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Based on this result, it would have been predicted that the IC50 in brain cells would have been about 11 nm at 30 μmO2 (19Koivisto A. Matthias A. Bronnikov G. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas with clamped NO concentrations, it was 10-fold higher (120 nm). Presumably, inadvertent effects of the bolus itself and/or the use of ever-changing concentrations during the decay phase account for the different values. In any case, boluses of NO are unlikely to be found in vivo because the relatively slow switch-on of NO synthesis, which is dependent on Ca2+-calmodulin interactions or phosphorylation cascades (2Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), would be quickly balanced by NO inactivation (predicted to impose a half-life on NO of about 100 ms; Refs. 11Griffiths C. Garthwaite J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 855-862Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar and 16Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), the result being a steady-state NO concentration analogous to that formed by the DETA/NO-red blood cell mixture (Figs. 1a and 4a) but much faster (a 100-ms time scale). It was only with O2 at very low concentrations that an NO concentration maximally active on the NOGCR (20 nm) could affect respiration. The O2concentration needed for 50% inhibition under these conditions (5 μm) corresponds to one that, if sustained for more than a few seconds in brain tissue, is pathological (17Erecinska M. Silver I.A. Respir. Physiol. 2001; 128: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Indeed, initial signs of metabolic stress occur in brain at about 10 μmO2 (17Erecinska M. Silver I.A. Respir. Physiol. 2001; 128: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), at which concentration 20 nm NO failed to affect respiration (Fig. 4c). Moreover, given the highKm value of the brain NO synthase for O2(350 μm; Ref. 33Santolini J. Meade A.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48887-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it is doubtful that 20 nmNO and low micromolar O2 could coexist unless the pathway that inactivates NO (11Griffiths C. Garthwaite J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 855-862Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) is compromised. However, although also O2-dependent (30Griffiths C. Yamini B. Hall C. Garthwaite J. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), this pathway is as active at 30 μm O2 as it is at 200 μm O2, indicating a much lowerKm value than the NO synthase. 3C. Griffiths and J. Garthwaite, unpublished observation. From these data, it is unlikely that NO concentrations in the range active on the NOGCR could simultaneously inhibit mitochondrial respiration in vivo. This raises the question of whether NO ever rises above this range physiologically to the extent that it could influence O2 consumption. Our attempt to answer this by maximal stimulation of endogenous NO formation in brain slices suggested that this was not the case in that local NO rose only to an apparent concentration of 4 nm. This is consistent with studies in the brain in vivo where, even under conditions of abnormally elevated neuronal activity, cGMP rises to only a fraction of the maximum levels achievable (34Wood P.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 1-25PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, from a recent spectroscopic analysis of cytochrome c oxidase in rat brain in vivo, it has been concluded that endogenous NO does not inhibit this enzyme, either during physiological conditions or during reperfusion following transient ischemia (35De Visscher G. Springett R. Delpy D.T. Van Reempts J. Borgers M. van Rossem K. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This finding accords with our data suggesting that NO rises only to about 1 nm in slices of rat striatum in vitro subjected to simulated ischemia and reperfusion (36Griffiths C. Garthwaite G. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The NO-consuming pathway identified recently in brain (11Griffiths C. Garthwaite J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 855-862Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) appears well suited to constrain NO concentrations to the low nanomolar range that selectively engages the NOGCR. Whether or not NO is similarly constrained in other tissues remains to be determined. Finally, the NO concentrations active on the NOGCR have long been used as a guide to the physiological NO concentrations existing in tissues, and thus, to the exogenous concentrations that should be applied experimentally. Our results suggest a downward revision by about 2 orders of magnitude in this range. As a consequence, many findings made using NO concentrations previously considered physiological may be of more pathological relevance, although what constitutes a pathological NO concentration in vivo remains to be defined."

Therefore, we generated and characterized transgenic mice overexpressing human renin (hREN) under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter (GFAP-hREN) and synapsin-I promoter (SYN-hREN) and bred them with mice expressing human angiotensinogen (hAGT) under the control of the same promoters (GFAP-hAGT and SYN-hAGT). Both GFAP-hREN and SYN-hREN mice exhibited the highest hREN mRNA expression in the brain and had undetectable levels of hREN protein in the systemic circulation. In the brain of GFAP-hREN and SYN-hREN mice, hREN protein was observed almost exclusively in astrocytes and neurons, respectively. Transgenic mice overexpressing both hREN and hAGT transgenes in either glia or neurons were moderately hypertensive. In the glia-targeted mice, blood pressure could be corrected by intracerebroventricular injection of the Ang-II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan, and intravenous injection of a ganglion blocking agent, but not an arginine vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, lowered blood pressure. These data suggest that stimulation of Ang-II type 1 receptors in the brain by Ang-II derived from local synthesis of renin and angiotensinogen can cause an elevation in blood pressure via a mechanism involving enhanced sympathetic outflow.

Buckley J.P. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1961; 106: 834-837Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence has accumulated that Ang-II has actions on the CNS including increasing sympathetic outflow, arginine vasopressin (AVP) release, water intake, and salt appetite (2Wright J.W. Harding J.W. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1992; 17: 227-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Existence of a local RAS in the CNS has been suggested, since all components of this system have been reported in the brain. In addition, several lines of evidence point to a contribution of an overactive brain RAS to the hypertensive state in spontaneously hypertensive rats, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) salt hypertensive rats, Dahl salt sensitive rats, and renal hypertensive rats (3Yongue B.G. Angulo J.A. McEwen B.S. Myers M.M. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Pochiero M. Nicoletta P. Losi E. Bianchi A. Caputi A.P. Pharmacol. Res.

Despite numerous studies demonstrating the important cardiovascular effects of Ang-II or Ang-II receptor antagonists injected into the brain, it remains unclear whether RAS components synthesized in the brain, in particular renin and angiotensinogen (AGT), have an important role in the local synthesis of Ang-II. In the brain, AGT expression is localized mainly in astrocytes (glia) (7Thomas W.G. Sernia C. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 319-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Stornetta R.L. Hawelu Johnson C.L. Guyenet P.G. Lynch K.R. Science. 1988; 242: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To determine whether locally synthesized AGT can be processed to Ang-II in the brain, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing human AGT (hAGT) under the control of an astrocyte-specific (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) promoter (GFAP-hAGT) (9Morimoto S. Cassell M.D. Beltz T.G. Johnson A.K. Davisson R.L. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These mice exhibit hAGT expression primarily in the brain but have a normal BP because of the strict species specificity of the enzymatic reaction between AGT and renin (10Hatae T. Takimoto E. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of purified recombinant human renin (hREN) protein elicited a pressor response, which was prevented by ICV preinjection of an Ang-II type 1 receptor antagonist, losartan. Accordingly, we concluded that AGT synthesized in the brain can be converted to Ang-II if renin is present. In addition to glia, AGT is expressed in select populations of neurons in regions of the brain, such as the subfornical organ, that can influence cardiovascular function (7Thomas W.G. Sernia C. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 319-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Imboden H. Harding J.W. Hilgenfeldt U. Celio M.R. Felix D. Brain Res. 1987; 410: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine the relevance of neuronal AGT, we also developed a transgene overexpressing hAGT from a neuronal promoter, synapsin-I (SYN) (12Morimoto S. Cassell M.D. Sigmund C.D. Physiol Genomics. 2002; 9: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As above, expression was high in the brain, and hAGT was exclusively localized in neurons co-expressing the neuronal marker NeuN. ICV infusion of purified hREN caused a transient pressor response, suggesting that Ang-II release from either glial cells or neurons is functional in the brain. ICV injection of homologous species renin increases BP in several animals (13Buckley J.P. Jandhyala B.S. Doursout M.F. Huang Y.K. Chelly J.E. J Physiol (Paris). 1984; 79: 485-490PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kawasaki H. Takasaki K. Furukawa T. Eur. J Pharmacol. 1987; 138: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and early studies detected renin activity in the brain (15Ganten D. Marquez-Julio A. Granger P. Hayduk K. Karsunky K.P. Boucher R. Genest J. Am. J. Physiol. 1971; 221: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Fischer-Ferraro C. Nahmod V.E. Goldstein D.J. Finkielman S. J. Exp. Med. 1971; 133: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Later, immunoreactive renin was found in the hypothalamus and cerebellar cortex in the mouse and rat brain and in neurons in all areas of the human brain (17Fuxe K. Ganten D. Hokfelt T. Locatelli V. Poulsen K. Stock G. Rix E. Taugner R. Neurosci. Lett. 1980; 18: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Slater E.E. Defendini R. Zimmerman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5458-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Despite these observations and the clear documentation of the expression of the other RAS genes in the brain, the notion that renin is endogenously expressed in brain remains controversial. We recently reported hREN expression in the brain of a new transgenic model containing a tightly regulated hREN transgene (19Morimoto S. Cassell M.D. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Renin-containing cells were detected in neurons in the brain stem, and in glial cells in the hypothalamus and cortex. We therefore hypothesize that local synthesis of renin may cleave locally synthesized AGT to produce brain Ang-II. To test this hypothesis and to determine the functional role of glial and neuronal hREN expression, we generated two novel transgenic mouse models expressing hREN under the control of either the GFAP promoter (GFAP-hREN) or the SYN promoter (SYN-hREN). A cDNA encoding a modified hREN protein was removed from pRhR1100FM (generous gift from Dr. Timothy L.

A 2.2-kb fragment of human GFAP promoter was excised with EcoRI from the plasmid gfa2 and was subcloned into pBluescript II SK+/− to form pGFAP-SK (22Brenner M. Kisseberth W.C., Su, Y. Besnard F. Messing A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rat SYN promoter was amplified by PCR from pBL4.3 Syn-CAT to contain EcoRV andBamHI ends (23Hoesche C. Sauerwald A. Veh R.W. Krippl B. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26494-26502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The modified SYN promoter was cloned into the EcoRV-BamHI sites of pBluescript II SK+/− to create pSYN-SK. The intron, renin cDNA, and SV40 poly(A) site was removed from pSTEC-1 and ligated to pGFAP-SK to create GFAP-hREN and to pSYN-SK to form SYN-hREN. All cloning junctions were confirmed by sequencing. The modifications consisted of replacing the normal prorenin-converting enzyme cleavage site with the ubiquitous processing protease furin and tagging the carboxyl terminus of the protein with a Myc epitope (24Prescott G. Silversides D.W. Chiu S.M. Reudelhuber T.L. Physiol Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Myc epitope did not provide sufficient sensitivity to detect the protein using anti-Myc antiserum. The transgenes were excised by digestion with BssHII and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Transgene DNA was microinjected into one-cell fertilized mouse embryos obtained from superovulated C57BL/6J X SJL/J (B6SJL F2) mice using standard procedures. All transgenic mice were heterozygous and were maintained by breeding with B6SJL F1 mice. Transgenic mice carrying both GFAP-hREN and GFAP-hAGT transgenes were generated by breeding heterozygous GFAP-hREN with heterozygous GFAP-hAGT transgenic mice. The SYN-hREN/SYN-hAGT double transgenic mice were similarly bred. Mice used for experiments were 15–20 weeks of age. Nontransgenic age-matched littermates from the same breeding were always used as controls in the studies described herein. All mice received standard mouse chow (LM-485; Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets, Madison, WI) and water ad libitum unless specified. Care of the mice used in the experiments met the standards set forth by the National Institutes of Health in their guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals, and all procedures were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa. Existence of transgene(s) was identified by PCR of tail genomic DNA using hREN- and/or hAGT-specific primer sets as described previously (25Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Carney C. Schlager G. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Results of PCR for GFAP-hREN and SYN-hREN founder mice were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Tissues were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was purified using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center Inc.). RNase protection assays were performed using the RPA III kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Total RNA (50 μg) was hybridized to hREN, and mouse β-actin probes were labeled with [α-32P]UTP byin vitro transcription and purified through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protected fragments for hREN and mouse β-actin were 300 and 245 bp, respectively. Plasma renin activity and concentration were determined as described previously (26Thompson M.W. Smith S.B. Sigmund C.D. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Radioimmunoassay was performed on plasma using the angiotensin I (Ang-I)125I-labeled RIA kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were diluted with reagent blank to remain on the linear portion of the standard curve. Brain sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at 25 °C and incubated at 4 °C 18 h with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against hREN (1:2,000 dilution for GFAP-hREN and 1:100 for SYN-hREN; kindly provided by Professor Pierre Corvol, INSERM U36, College de France), which had been preadsorbed with nontransgenic brain sections at 4 °C for 48 h (19Morimoto S. Cassell M.D. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sections also incubated with mouse monoclonal antisera (Chemicon International Inc.) against either GFAP (1:1,000 dilution), microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2; 1:400 dilution), or neuronal nuclei (NeuN; 1:500) (Chemicon International) as described (19Morimoto S. Cassell M.D. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GFAP-hREN samples were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:250 dilution), avidin D (1:50), biotinylated anti-avidin (1:125), fluorescein avidin D (1:250; all from Vector Laboratories), and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution; Chemicon International); each incubation was at 25 °C for 1 h followed by rinsing with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS except for the last rinse, which used PBS. Measurement of arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) and ICV and intravenous infusion studies were performed in conscious, unrestrained mice as described previously (9Morimoto S. Cassell M.D. Beltz T.G. Johnson A.K. Davisson R.L. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, base-line AP and HR were measured continuously for 1 h/day for 3 consecutive days starting 2 days after surgery. The effect of ICV losartan (10 μg; generous gift of Merck) and artificial cerebrospinal fluid on basal AP and HR was examined. Intravenous injection of the same dose of losartan was also tested. The effects of intravenous injection of a ganglion blocker, hexamethonium (5 mg/kg intravenously), an antagonist of peripheral arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1receptors (AVPX; Manning Compound (d(CH2)5Tyr2(ME)Arg8)-vasopressin; 10 μg/kg intravenously), and saline on base-line AP and HR were also determined. All hemodynamic data were collected and analyzed on a computer using Chart version 4.0.1 in Powerlab. Drinking volume of water and salt preference were measured as described previously (9Morimoto S. Cassell M.D. Beltz T.G. Johnson A.K. Davisson R.L. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); water intake was measured individually in metabolic cages with standard chow and tap water ad libitum daily for 3 days. To determine salt preference, mice were fed salt-deficient chow and given 0.3 mol/liter hypertonic saline and tap water in separate randomized burettes ad libitum for 3 days. Salt preference was calculated as a percentage by dividing the volume of saline consumed by the total volume of fluid consumed. Urinary volume was measured by collecting 24-h urine in metabolic cages with standard chow ground with tap water (100 g of chow/150 ml of water) and tap waterad libitum daily for 3 days. Urinary and plasma osmolality were measured by using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor Inc.). Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Group comparisons were made with unpaired t tests and confirmed with repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Student’s modified t test with Bonferroni correction. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. GFAP-hREN and SYN-hREN transgenic mice were generated by fusing the GFAP and SYN promoters to a hREN cDNA. Since the mechanisms activating renin in the brain are unknown, we chose to use a hREN cDNA that was modified to contain a ubiquitous furin cleavage site in place of the prorenin-converting enzyme site normally separating the prosegment from the active enzyme (Fig.1A). Three transgenic founders of each construct were identified, and two GFAP-hREN and three SYN-hREN founders were successfully bred to establish transgenic lines. An RNase protection assay was used to examine the tissue-specific expression of the transgenes. In GFAP-hREN line 10267/4, low but clearly detectable expression of hREN mRNA was observed in the brain with lower expression in other tissues such as heart, lung, spleen, submandibular gland, and white adipose tissue (Fig.1B). In SYN-hREN line 11110/2, robust expression of hREN mRNA was detected in the brain, with low level ectopic expression evident in brown adipose tissue (Fig. 1C). TableI shows a quantitative summary of hREN mRNA expression in all lines of GFAP-hREN and SYN-hREN transgenic mice. GFAP-hREN line 10267/4 and Syn-hREN line 11110/2 were selected for further analysis, since these exhibited the highest level of expression in the brain and retained the most brain-restricted pattern of hREN expression.Table ISummary of hREN expression in GFAP-hREN and SYN-hREN transgenic miceLineConnBrainLiverKidneyHeartLungAdrenalAortaSpleenSalivaryDiaphragmWATBATSkeletalTestes10267/4G3130.4 ± 48.34.7 ± 3.51.6 ± 1.14.3 ± 3.119.1 ± 12.80.8 ± 0.50.8 ± 0.53.3 ± 2.711.3 ± 2.41.1 ± 0.753.2 ± 22.70.9 ± 0.513.2 ± 11.44.0 ± 4.010268/4G232.5 0.3 0.01.60.20.00.10.117.9 5.714.732.517.91.111110/2S3448.2 ± 173.420.1 ± 9.90.33 ± 0.29.4 ± 4.8111.8 ± 86.20.2 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.816.2 ± 16.20 ± 00 ± 01.8 ± 1.7234.8 ± 168.6111.6 ± 58.344.7 ± 44.711114/3S178.011.130.57.33.21.61.86.2 9.0 2.465.121.654.66.111116/1S263.5 0.4 4.91.30.30.30.31.3 1.812.222.429.0 5.71.3Expression was quantified by scanning the RPA films and analyzed by NIH (SCION) IMAGE.

Given the presence of “ectopic” hREN mRNA expression in tissues outside the brain, we were concerned that hREN protein might be released into the systemic circulation. Therefore, we measured plasma hREN concentration to determine whether transgene expression outside the brain results in a significant increase of hREN protein in the systemic circulation (Table II). The fidelity and specificity of the assay was confirmed by the observation of basal levels of mouse renin (24.5 ± 3.7 versus30.3 ± 3.4 ng of Ang-I/ml/h, transgenic versuscontrol) and hREN protein (14.1 ± 1.7 versus 3.2 ± 0.8 ng of Ang-I/ml/h, transgenic versus control) in the plasma of transgenic mice expressing hREN under the control of its own promoter (termed systemic hREN transgenic mice) (27Sigmund C.D. Jones C.A. Kane C.M., Wu, C. Lang J.A. Gross K.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although all five lines of GFAP-hREN and SYN-hREN transgenic mice exhibited a slight increase in hREN concentration in the plasma, these values were not significantly different from those for nontransgenic mice. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a significant amount of hREN protein is released into the systemic circulation in either the glial or neuronal transgenic models.Table IIPlasma hREN concentrationnMouse PRAHuman PRCng Ang-I/ml/hNontransgenic930.3 ± 3.43.2 ± 0.82-aRepresents background of the assay.GFAP-hREN Line 10267/4524.9 ± 4.84.1 ± 1.0 Line 10268/4524.4 ± 3.84.2 ± 1.3SYN-hREN Line 11110/2532.7 ± 5.95.3 ± 0.9 Line 11114/3531.7 ± 3.36.6 ± 1.8 Line 11116/1529.9 ± 1.63.8 ± 1.0Systemic hREN Line 9824.5 ± 3.714.1 ± 1.72-bp < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice.2-a Represents background of the assay.2-b p < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice. Open table in a new tab To examine the cell-specific expression of the transgene in the brain, double labeling for hREN and GFAP (a glial marker), MAP-2, or NeuN (neuronal markers) was performed. In GFAP-hREN transgenic mice, hREN staining was observed in the cell bodies and processes of astrocytes in almost all regions of the brain as confirmed by co-staining with GFAP, but not with MAP-2 (Fig. 2,A–D; Table III). In nontransgenic mice, some very light hREN immunostaining of glia-like elements was observed in cortex (Fig. 2E). This immunostaining was generally distributed throughout the brain and showed no regional specificity. The only exception to this was the subfornical organ (Fig. 2, F–I) and area postrema (data not shown), where hREN co-localized with both GFAP and MAP-2. We showed previously that the GFAP promoter targeted expression of hAGT to neurons in the subfornical organ (9Morimoto S. Cassell M.D. Beltz T.G. Johnson A.K. Davisson R.L. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, hREN-positive radial astroglia were observed in cerebellum (Fig. 2J). Strong nonspecific staining was still detected in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum in both controls and transgenic mice although the antiserum was preadsorbed with brain sections from control mice (Fig.2, J and K). In SYN-hREN mice, hREN staining was observed in the cell bodies of neurons in all regions of the brain as confirmed by co-staining with NeuN but not with GFAP (Fig.3, A–D, Table III). Only low background staining was observed in sections from nontransgenic controls (Fig. 3E).Table IIIDistribution of hREN staining in brain of transgenic miceGFAP-hRENSYN-hRENGliaNeuronGliaNeuronBrain Stem Medulla Nucleus of the solitary tract+−−+ Dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus−−−+ Area postrema+?+?−+ Ventrolateral medulla−−−+ Inferior olivary nucleus+−−+ Pons Locus coeruleus−−−+ Parabrachial nucleus−?−+ Mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus−?−+ Midbrain Periaqueductal gray+−−+ Superior colliculus+−−+ Thalamus Paraventricular nucleus+−−+ Ventral posterior thalamus+−−+ Lateral septal nucleus+−−+ Hypothalamus Paraventricular nucleus+−−+ Supraoptic nucleus+−−+ Ventromedial nucleus+−−+ Suprachiasmatic nucleus+−−+ Median eminence+−−+ Organum vasculosum of the lamina+−−+ Terminalis Periventricular anteroventral third+−−+ Ventricle Median preoptic nucleus+−−+Cerebrum Hippocampus+−−+ Subfornical organ++−+ Amygdala+−−+ Cortex+−−+Cerebellum+?−+The symbols are: +, expression positive; −, expression negative; +?, expression likely; ?, expression unclear.

To examine the physiological significance of the local production of renin and AGT in the brain on BP and electrolyte homeostasis, we generated GFAP-hREN/GFAP-hAGT and SYN-hREN/SYN-hAGT double transgenic mice. Because there is a strict species specificity of the biochemical reaction between AGT and renin (10Hatae T. Takimoto E. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), there was no difference in base-line mean arterial pressure (MAP) or HR between single GFAP-hREN transgenic mice (lacking the human AGT gene) and their nontransgenic littermates (GFAP-hREN, 118 ± 3 mm Hg, 590 ± 32 bpm,n = 5; nontransgenic, 116 ± 4 mm Hg, 594 ± 20 bpm, n = 7) or between single SYN-hREN transgenic mice and their nontransgenic littermates (SYN-hREN, 114 ± 3 mm Hg, 628 ± 34 bpm, n = 5; nontransgenic, 119 ± 5 mm Hg, 609 ± 28 bpm, n = 5). In contrast, both the neuronal and glial double transgenic mice (containing both hREN and hAGT in brain) exhibited a moderate but significant elevation in MAP on each of the 3 days of measurement (compiled in Fig.4). Although statistically significant, the elevation in MAP is probably not enough to consider them overtly hypertensive, since there are some strains of mice with higher base line arterial pressure (28Ryan M.J. Didion S.P. Davis D.R. Faraci F.M. Sigmund C.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Base-line HR was not significantly different between double transgenic and control groups. ICV injection of losartan (10 μg) caused an approximately 11 mm Hg fall in MAP in the GFAP-hREN/GFAP-hAGT mice, reducing MAP back to base line (Fig. 5A). Nontransgenic mice exhibited only a 5 mm Hg decrease in MAP. The HR change induced by ICV losartan was variable and did not achieve statistical significance in either group. Intravenous administration of the same amount of losartan-injected ICV did not significantly affect MAP or HR in either group. Because of the possible contribution of increased brain RAS to the elevated BP in these double transgenic mice, we wanted to investigate the mechanism of chronic BP elevation downstream of the CNS. We focused these studies in the GFAP-hREN/GFAP-hAGT mice because the blood pressure increase was larger than in SYN-hREN/SYN-hAGT. The major mechanisms of pressor response to ICV Ang-II are via activation of sympathetic nervous system and/or AVP secretion. Consequently, we examined the effects of intravenous treatment with a ganglionic blocking agent, hexamethonium, and an AVP V1 receptor antagonist, AVPX, on BP. Intravenous injection of hexamethonium caused a greater fall in MAP in glia-specific mice than nontransgenic mice (Fig. 5B). Although the reduction in MAP by intravenous AVPX tended to be greater in the transgenic mice, the difference did not achieve statistical significance (Fig. 5C). Finally, we measured drinking volume, salt preference, and urinary volume in both the glia- and neuron-specific double transgenic mice (Fig. 6). Drinking volume and salt preference were significantly higher in both models compared with controls (Fig. 6, A and B). Concomitant with increased water intake, urinary volume was significantly higher in the double transgenics (Fig. 6C). Urinary osmolality was lower in glia-specific mice (1,612 ± 163 mosmol/KgH2O,n = 11) than controls (2,240 ± 156 mosmol/KgH2O, n = 11, p < 0.01). Urinary osmolality tended to be lower in neuron-specific mice (1,804 ± 168 mosmol/KgH2O, n = 11) but did not reach statistical significance. In this light, urine output was lower in the neuron-specific mice than in the glia-specific mice (Fig. 6C). Plasma osmolality was not different between the groups (glia-specific, 335 ± 9, n = 5; neuron-specific, 325 ± 6, n = 9; co"

This virus has a 9.6-kb positive-stranded RNA genome that codes for a polyprotein with a length of slightly more than 3000 amino acids. The HCV structural proteins, core, E1, and E2, are located at the amino terminus and are released from the polyprotein by the cellular signal peptidase located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5Hijikata M.

The non-structural proteins, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B, are located at the carboxyl terminus and are separated from each other by the protease activity residing within the NS3 protein (7Tomei L.

Lindenbach B.D. Pragai B.M. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5063-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to contain a signal sequence to direct the downstream NS2 protein to the membranes (11Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Tanji Y. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2731-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS2 is separated from its preceding p7 protein by the signal peptidase (11Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Tanji Y. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2731-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of NS2 in the HCV life cycle is unclear. Its deletion did not abolish the replication of HCV RNA in cell cultures, indicating that it is not required for viral RNA replication (12Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 13Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). The separation of NS2 and its following NS3 protein requires most of the NS2 sequence and its adjacent NS3 protease domain (14Pieroni L. Santolini E. Fipaldini C. Pacini L. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6373-6380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The deduced amino acid sequence of NS2 indicates that it is a hydrophobic protein. Previous studies indicate that NS2 is a non-glycosylated integral membrane protein and mostly not exposed in the cytosol (15Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. Monica N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the membrane topology of this protein remains unclear. In this report, we have studied the molecular mechanism that regulates the membrane translocation of NS2. Interestingly, our results indicate that the membrane-association of NS2 is p7-independent. Further studies indicate that NS2 contains at least two internal signal sequences for its membrane association and likely has multiple transmembrane domains.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies indicate that the HCV NS2 protein is an integral membrane protein that is targeted to the ER membrane by a signal sequence located in its preceding p7 protein (11Mizushima H.

Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have further studied how NS2 associates with the membranes. In agreement with the earlier studies, we found that the NS2 protein was separated from the preceding p7 sequence only in the presence of membranes (Fig. 1A), indicative of separation by the signal peptidase. Interestingly, we also found that NS2, in the absence of p7, could become membrane-associated (Fig. 1B). This membrane association is supported by the immunofluorescence double-staining experiment using the ER-associated calreticulin as the ER marker (Fig.2B). Because this membrane association could not be abolished by treating the membranes with 1 m NaCl or by extraction with the chaotropic alkaline carbonate buffer (Fig. 4), NS2 was apparently an integral membrane protein. The association of NS2 with the membranes only occurred co-translationally (Fig. 3), suggesting the presence of internal signal sequences in NS2. This possibility was tested by the deletion-mapping experiments, which revealed two internal signal sequences located within aa 839–883 and aa 928–960 (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). These two sequences could target the α-globin reporter, a cytosolic protein, to the membranes in HuH7 cells (Figs. 7 and 8).The identification of the two internal signal sequences suggests that NS2 is a type III integral membrane protein with multiple transmembrane domains (20Matlack K.E. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Singer S.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 247-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To further study the membrane topology of NS2, we performed the glycosylation studies by introducing glycosylation sites into various regions of the NS2 sequence. Interestingly, the glycosylation site introduced near the amino terminus of NS2 was used independent of the p7 sequence (Fig. 9A). These results indicate that the amino terminus of NS2 can be localized to the ER lumen independent of p7. Because the presence of p7 did not significantly increase the glycosylation efficiency of NS2–812G (Fig.9A), the role of the p7 signal sequence in the membrane translocation of NS2 is unclear. The p7 signal sequence may be needed only for the separation of NS2 from its preceding HCV sequences by signal peptidases.The hydrophobicity plot of NS2 based on its deduced amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 10A. The sequence aa 814–835 near the amino terminus is highly hydrophobic. It is conceivable that this hydrophobic domain serves as the first transmembrane domain that will have a type I topology, because the amino terminus of NS2 is localized in the ER lumen. If this is correct, the hydrophilic sequence immediately following aa 835 is expected to be localized in the cytosol. The observation that the glycosylation site introduced at aa 839 was not used is consistent with this speculation (Fig. 10B). The first internal signal sequence was mapped between aa 839 and 883 (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). This sequence likely contains the second transmembrane domain. As the glycosylation site introduced at aa 869 was used for glycosylation, the second transmembrane domain may be residing between aa 843 and 866, a sequence that is largely hydrophobic (Fig. 10A). This second transmembrane domain will have a type II topology with the amino terminus in the cytosol and the carboxyl terminus in the ER lumen.The sequence from aa 872 to 919 is highly hydrophobic (Fig.10A). This sequence may contain a third transmembrane domain. If this is correct, this transmembrane domain is expected to have a type I topology with the amino terminus in the ER lumen and the carboxyl terminus in the cytosol. The second signal sequence was identified between aa 928 and 960. This sequence likely contains the fourth transmembrane domain. The sequence from aa 928 to 956 is highly hydrophobic and may serve this function (Fig. 10A). If this second signal sequence indeed contains another transmembrane domain, it will likely have a type II topology with its carboxyl terminus localized to the ER lumen, because the glycosylation site introduced at aa 988 was used for glycosylation (Fig. 9B, also see Ref.15Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. Monica N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of NS2 is predicted to localize in the ER lumen, because the glycosylation site introduced at aa 1018 near the carboxyl terminus was used for glycosylation (Fig. 9B). This result is consistent with the glycosylation studies of Santoliniet al. (15Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. Monica N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who also predicted that the carboxyl terminus of NS2 would be localized to the ER lumen. A model of the NS2 topology in the membrane is illustrated in Fig. 10B. This model predicts that the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus are localized to the ER lumen and that NS2 has a total of four alternating type I and type II transmembrane domains.In conclusion, our studies have allowed us to identify two internal signal sequences in the NS2 sequence, which allowed us to propose a model that NS2 has a type III membrane topology with multiple transmembrane domains. This model will now enable us to further explore the possible functions of NS2, which have remained largely elusive.

This virus has a 9.6-kb positive-stranded RNA genome that codes for a polyprotein with a length of slightly more than 3000 amino acids. The HCV structural proteins, core, E1, and E2, are located at the amino terminus and are released from the polyprotein by the cellular signal peptidase located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5Hijikata M.

The non-structural proteins, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B, are located at the carboxyl terminus and are separated from each other by the protease activity residing within the NS3 protein (7Tomei L.

Lindenbach B.D. Pragai B.M. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5063-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to contain a signal sequence to direct the downstream NS2 protein to the membranes (11Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Tanji Y. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2731-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS2 is separated from its preceding p7 protein by the signal peptidase (11Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Tanji Y. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2731-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of NS2 in the HCV life cycle is unclear. Its deletion did not abolish the replication of HCV RNA in cell cultures, indicating that it is not required for viral RNA replication (12Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M.

Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). The separation of NS2 and its following NS3 protein requires most of the NS2 sequence and its adjacent NS3 protease domain (14Pieroni L. Santolini E. Fipaldini C. Pacini L. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6373-6380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of NS2 indicates that it is a hydrophobic protein. Previous studies indicate that NS2 is a non-glycosylated integral membrane protein and mostly not exposed in the cytosol (15Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. Monica N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the membrane topology of this protein remains unclear. In this report, we have studied the molecular mechanism that regulates the membrane translocation of NS2. Interestingly, our results indicate that the membrane-association of NS2 is p7-independent. Further studies indicate that NS2 contains at least two internal signal sequences for its membrane association and likely has multiple transmembrane domains. DISCUSSIONPrevious studies indicate that the HCV NS2 protein is an integral membrane protein that is targeted to the ER membrane by a signal sequence located in its preceding p7 protein (11Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Tanji Y. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2731-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. Monica N. J.

https://openalex.org/W2058009015,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin are known to prevent apoptosis. The signaling network of IGF-1 and insulin occurs via multiple pathways involving different insulin receptor substrates (IRSs). To define their roles in the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 and insulin, we established brown pre-adipocyte cell lines from wild-type and IRS knockout (KO) animals. In response to 16 h of serum deprivation, IRS-1-deficient cells showed a significant decrease in response to IGF-1 protection from apoptosis, whereas no changes were observed in the IRS-2, IRS-3, or IRS-4 KO cells. Five hours after serum withdrawal, cells already began to undergo apoptosis. At this early time point, IGF-1 and insulin were able to protect both wild-type and IRS-1 KO cells from death by 85–90%. After a longer period of serum deprivation, the protective ability of insulin and IGF-1 was decreased, and this was especially reduced in the IRS-1 KO cells. Reconstitution of these cells with IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, or IRS-1/IRS-2 chimeras restored the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-1, whereas overexpression of IRS-4 had no effect at long time points and actually reduced the effect of IGF-1 at the short time point. The biochemical basis of the defect in anti-apoptosis was not dependent on phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase; whereas phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity was decreased by 30% in IRS-1 KO cells. Akt phosphorylation was slightly reduced in these cells. Phosphorylation of the transcription factors cAMP response element-binding protein and FKHR by IGF-1 and insulin was markedly reduced in IRS-1 KO cells. In addition, both IGF-1 and insulin prevented caspase-3 cleavage in the wild-type cells, and this effect was greatly reduced in the IRS-1-deficient cells. These findings suggest that the IRS proteins may play differential roles in the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-1 and insulin in brown pre-adipocytes, with IRS-1 being predominant, possibly acting through caspase-3-, CREB-, and FKHR-dependent mechanisms.

Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The biological effects of both of these peptides are mediated by the activation of their respective cell surface receptors. Activation of these receptors results in phosphorylation of several IRSs. These, in turn, interact with SH2 domain-containing proteins such as PI3K, Grb2, SHP2, and others. Activation of PI3K leads to activation of the main downstream effector Akt and stimulation of several biological responses, including glucose metabolism and cell proliferation and survival. Association of IRS proteins with Grb2 leads to recruitment of SOS and Ras and results in activation of the MAPK pathway, a major regulatory pathway for gene expression. The IRS proteins are a growing family of proteins that are phosphorylated by the activated insulin and IGF-1 receptors as well as growth hormone and cytokine receptors. There are at least four members of this family that have been identified (IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-4). With the exception of IRS-3, which is about 60 kDa in size and not found in the humans, the other IRS proteins range in size between 160 and 185 kDa and are present in both humans and rodents. To obtain a better understanding of the physiological role of the four different IRS proteins, we and others have established mice with a targeted knockout (KO) of each IRS gene. IRS-1-deficient mice have a phenotype of growth retardation and insulin resistance (2Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Brüning J.C. Haag III, B.L. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R.

In contrast, mice with disruption of IRS-3 do not show any obvious defect in growth or glucose metabolism (5Liu S. Wang Q. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol.

Our laboratory has successfully established brown pre-adipocyte cell lines derived from different KO mice and begun to use these cells as a model system to study the roles of various IRS proteins in cell growth, survival, and differentiation.

Recently, we have found that IRS-3 and IRS-4 act as negative regulators of IGF-1 signaling pathway by suppressing the function of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in embryonic fibroblasts (9Tsuruzoe K. Emkey R. Kriauciunas K.M. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the extent to which the various IRS proteins may play uniqueversus redundant or complementary roles in other insulin- and IGF-1-mediated responses is still poorly understood. Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, which plays a critical role in controlling cell number and eliminating misplaced cells, and is characterized by chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic blebbing, and DNA fragmentation (10Hengartner M.O. Nat. Insight. 2000; 407: 770-776Google Scholar). At the molecular level, apoptosis involves at least three major components: the Bcl-2 protein family; the caspases, which belong to a family of cysteine proteases; and the Apaf-1/CED-4 protein that relays the signals integrated by Bcl-2 protein family to caspases (11Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Depletion of growth factors is a common cause of apoptosis. Several peptide growth factors are considered to generate signals for growth and survival, including IGF-1 and insulin. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed by which these factors protect cells from apoptosis, including the PI3K/Akt pathway (12Minshall C. Arkins S. Dantzer R. Freund G.G. Kelley K.W. J.

Although intensive studies have been done to elucidate the involvement of different downstream signaling molecules in the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 and insulin, little is know about the contribution of different IRS proteins in mediating these responses. In the present study, we have investigated the role of the IRS proteins in the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 and insulin by using KO cell lines derived from all four IRS KO mice. IRS-1 deficiency causes a significant reduction in response to IGF-1 and insulin protection from serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Caspase-3 and the transcription factors CREB and FKHR appear to be downstream mediators of IRS-1, which may mediate the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 and insulin. Human recombinant IGF-1 was obtained from Pepro Tec. Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human recombinant insulin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified. Antibodies to IRS-1 (JD287 and JD288, which recognized amino acid residues 511–859 and 859–1233 of mouse IRS-1, respectively) and IRS-2 (JD250) were prepared as described previously (22Sun X.J.

The antibody against IRS-3 was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 240–491 of rat IRS-3 as previously described (9Tsuruzoe K. Emkey R.

Anti-phospho-FKHRL1 (Ser-253) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Brown pre-adipocytes were isolated and immortalized as previously described (7Fasshauer M. Klein J.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. Retroviral expression vectors of human IRS-1, mouse IRS-2, mouse IRS-3, and mouse IRS-4 were prepared as previously described (7Fasshauer M. Klein J. Kriauciunas K.M. Ueki K. Benito M. Kahn C.R. Mol.

N1.C2 and N2.C1 chimeras were constructed by using the AflIII sites of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which located approximately half of each protein. The N1.C2 chimera had N-terminal half of IRS-1 and C-terminal region of IRS-2. Conversely, the N2.C1 chimera contained the N-terminal domain of IRS-2 and C-terminal half of IRS-1. 3 μg of these plasmids was transfected into ΦNX-packaging cells in 6-cm-diameter plates using the calcium phosphate method (24Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). The cells were refed 10 h later, and viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection. KO cells were infected at 70% confluence in a 12-well plate with Polybrene (8 μg/ml)-supplemented virus-containing supernatant for overnight. 48 h after infection, cells from each well were trypsinized and transferred to a 15-cm-diameter plate. Stable cell lines were established by selection in medium containing 250 μg/ml bleomycin analogue, ZeocinC. For transient transfection, 5 × 105 cells were plated on a well of six-well plates and grown overnight at 37 °C. 5 μg of pEBG-mBad DNA (Cell Signaling Technology) was transfected into the cells using LF2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 5 h. Then the cells were washed twice with medium and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS for overnight. 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-deprived for 4 h and stimulated with 10 nm IGF-1 or insulin for 10 min. Cell lysates were prepared as described below. Cells were plated at 4000 cells per well in multiple 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. Then the cells were washed twice with medium containing no FBS and serum-deprived in medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin alone or treated with 100 nm IGF-1 or insulin for indicated times. Cells cultured in serum-containing medium were used as negative controls. Apoptosis was measured by detection of DNA fragmentation using a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into cytosol was calculated using the formula suggest by the manufacture: (absorbance of sample cells)/(absorbance of negative control cells). The protective effects of IGF-1 and insulin were calculated by using the following formula: (enrichment factors of serum-deprived cells subtracts enrichment factors of IGF-1- or insulin-treated cells)/(enrichment factors of serum-deprived cells). The numbers were then multiple by 100 to give the percentage of protection. Mean and standard error values from three or four independent experiments were calculated as percentage of wild-type control within each experiment. Cells grown on a 100-mm dish were serum-deprived overnight in medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then treated for the indicated times with IGF-1 or insulin at a final concentration of 10 nm. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.5 ml of lysis buffer as previously described (25Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Zhu J. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11832-11839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates (30–50 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using specific antisera and detection with chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). For detection of caspase-3 cleavage, cells were grown to confluence and serum-deprived for 4 or 7 h in the absence or presence of IGF-1 or insulin. Cells cultured in serum-containing medium were used as a negative control. Both floating and attached cells were collected and subjected to lysis and immunodetection as described above. Cell lysates were obtained as described above, and supernatants containing 500 μg of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose, washed three times with lysis buffer, washed twice with PI3K reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA), and resuspended in 50 μl of PI3K reaction buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidyl inositol (Avanti Polar Lipids). The reactions were performed, and phosphorylated lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography as described previously (26Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S.

Differences between two groups were evaluated by an unpaired Student t test. p < 0.05 was defined as indicating the presence of a statistically significant difference. To determine if the brown pre-adipocyte cell lines were sensitive to serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis, we grew the wild-type cells in media deprived from serum in the absence or presence of IGF-1 or insulin for various times (Fig.1A). Cells began to undergo apoptosis at as early as 5 h after serum deprivation as measured in the DNA fragmentation assay and reached a maximal level at 13 h. Both IGF-1 and insulin were able to protect these cells from apoptosis, with IGF-1 having the greater effect. At 13 h, IGF-1 was able to reduce cell death about 75%, whereas insulin could only protect 40% of the cells, and little or no apoptosis occurred when cells were cultured in the presence of serum. These results were confirmed by using other assays for apoptosis, such as propidium iodide staining coupled with flow cytometry analysis, and TUNEL assays (data not shown). Using the quantitative real-time PCR, we estimated the relative amount of different IRS variants in wild-type cells. 2Y.-H. Tseng and C. R. Kahn, unpublished observations. Both IRS-1 and IRS-2 were abundant in these cells with IRS-1 expressed at a slightly higher level than IRS-2. IRS-3 was expressed at a low level in the pre-adipocytes, whereas IRS-4 was barely detectable. We next examined the ability of IGF-1 to protect cells from 16-h serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis in different IRS KO cells (Fig.1B). There was a significant 30% decrease of IGF-1 protection in the IRS-1 KO cells as compared with the wild-type cells. In contrast, the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1 appeared to be normal in the IRS-2-, IRS-3-, or IRS-4-deficient cells. Basal rates of apoptosis following serum withdrawal were similar in all KO cells to that of the wild-type cells (data not shown). These data suggested that IRS-1 played an important role in the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1. To further investigate the role of IRS-1 in mediating the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 and insulin, we assessed the time course of apoptosis and rescue in wild-type and IRS-1 KO cells (Fig. 2). In both cell types, there was a time-dependent decrease in the ability of IGF-1 and insulin to protect against cell death. Interestingly, during the first 5 h, both hormones were able to protect at least 85% of the cells from apoptosis in both cell lines. After 5 h, deficiency of IRS-1 caused a significant reduction in the anti-apoptotic ability of IGF-1 and insulin. Based on these observations, we defined a biphasic response to IGF-1 and insulin protection of cells during serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. At the early phase (e.g.5 h), IRS-1 deficiency did not affect the anti-apoptotic function of both factors, whereas at the late phase (e.g. 13 h) IRS-1 played an important role. We also examined other downstream effectors that may mediate the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 and insulin. Caspase-3 is one of the key executioners of apoptosis. Activation of caspase-3 requires proteolytic processing of its inactive zymogen into active p17 and p12 subunits. Using an antibody that specifically recognized the large fragment (17 kDa) of activated caspase-3, we detected significant accumulation of cleaved p17 subunit of caspase-3 at as early as 4 h of serum deprivation (Fig.3A, lanes 1 and 5). In the wild-type cells, both IGF-1 and insulin were able to prevent the occurrence of caspase-3 cleavage, although with insulin the effect was not complete (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). In the IRS-1 KO cells, there was a slight increase of cleaved caspase-3, even in the presence of IGF-1 (Fig. 3A, lane 6), and this process was dramatically increased in the insulin-treated cells (Fig. 3A, lane 7). As a control, serum completely block caspase-3 cleavage in both wild-type and IRS-1 KO cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 8). After 7 h of serum deprivation, there was an increase in the amount of cleaved caspase-3 in both wild-type and IRS-1 KO cells treated with either IGF-1 or insulin, but a similar pattern was observed (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data suggest that, in the early phase, although we could not detect any defect in the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 and insulin in the IRS-1 KO cells by DNA fragmentation assay, these cells already displayed the defect in response to IGF-1 and insulin protection as measured by other earlier apoptotic event, such as caspase-3 cleavage. To confirm that the lack of IRS-1 was responsible for impaired responses to IGF-1 and insulin protection from apoptosis, and to examine the possible complementary versus redundancy among IRS family members with respect to their ability to mediate the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 and insulin, the IRS-1 KO cells were infected with retroviruses expressing full-length of IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, or IRS-4. Western blot analysis revealed about 30–80% (average 65%) IRS-1 re-expression of that seen in the wild-type cells (Fig.4A). IRS-2 protein was present in both wild-type and IRS-1 KO cells (Fig. 4B). The IRS-1 KO cells exhibited a slight increase in IRS-2 protein expression compared with the wild-type cells. This is consistent with previous observation by Valverde et al. (27Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in fetal brown adipocytes and was not altered by IRS-1 re-expression. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, we could increase the level of IRS-2 protein to about 2-fold over that in the parental cells. Both IRS-3 and IRS-4 proteins could be detected only in cells infected with retroviruses encoding the respective genes (Fig. 4, C and D). All IRS proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated upon 5 min of IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 4E). Consistent with our previous findings in embryonic fibroblasts (9Tsuruzoe K. Emkey R. Kriauciunas K.M. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), expression of either IRS-3 or IRS-4 in the IRS-1 KO cells showed a significant decrease in both IRS-2 protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 (Fig. 4, Band D). To estimate the relative “functional” concentration of each IRS protein in the reconstituted cells, we quantified the corresponding phosphorylated IRS protein (Fig.4E). This revealed reconstitution of IRS tyrosine phosphorylation to about 90, 100, 110, and 140% of that of wild-type in cells reconstituted with IRS-1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively. This result indicated that all the isoforms were sufficiently and almost equally expressed in the reconstituted cells. We next examined the ability of IGF-1 to protect these cell lines from 16-h serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis (Fig.5A). IRS-1-reconstituted cells showed a very significant increase in response to IGF-1 protection from apoptosis as compared with the IRS-1-deficient cells (p< 0.001). Expression of IRS-2 or IRS-3 in these cells also increased the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 (p < 0.05). In contrast, IRS-4 overexpression did not improve the deficiency in response to IGF-1 protection from cell death. Brown pre-adipocytes are very sensitive to serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. By 5 h of serum deprivation, we observed cell death as marked by DNA fragmentation (Figs. 1A and 2), caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 3A), by microscopy (data not shown), and annexin staining coupled with flow cytometry analysis (data not shown). At the early phase (e.g. 5 h), IRS-1 was not required for the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1 and insulin, because both hormones produced almost equal protective effects in both the wild-type and IRS-1 KO cells. Interestingly, overexpression of IRS-4 in the IRS-1-deficient cells caused an almost 50% reduction of IGF-1 protection from 5-h serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis, while other IRS proteins did not show any effect at this time point (Fig.5B). These data suggested that IRS-4 might act as a negative regulator in the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1. To further address the structure-function relationship of IRS proteins, we generated cell lines expressing IRS-1/IRS-2 chimeric proteins. Fortuitously, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 contained an AflIII site located approximately in the middle of each protein, and this site was in-frame with the coding sequence of IRS-1 and IRS-2 allowing for simple exchange of the two halves of each protein (Fig.6A). This resulted in two different IRS-1/IRS-2 chimeras. The N1.C2 construct contained an N-terminal half of IRS-1 and C-terminal region of IRS-2. Conversely, the N2.C1 chimera had all the N-terminal domains of IRS-2 and C-terminal half of IRS-1. Both chimeras were expressed in the IRS-1 KO cells by retroviral-mediated gene transfer. Using two different antibodies, JD 287 and JD 288, which recognize amino acids 511–859 and 859–1233 of IRS-1, respectively, we found that the N1.C2 construct was expressed at a similar level to that seen in the wild-type cells, but the N2.C1 chimera was expressed only about 10% of that of the wild-type cells (Fig. 6B). We also noticed that the levels of IRS-1 re-expression varied from 30% to 80% of that seen in the wild-type cells, which was consistent with the findings in Fig. 4. Interestingly, both chimeras appeared to be able to enhance the protective effect of IGF-1 from apoptosis caused by 16-h serum deprivation (Fig. 6C). Expression of the N1.C2 construct in IRS-1-deficient cells displayed a greater effect than that of expression of IRS-1 or IRS-2 alone or the N2.C1 chimera in the IRS-1 KO cells. The enhancing effect of N1.C2 construct may be due to overexpression of this chimeric protein in the cells or to an important role of the N terminus in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of IRS-1. To address the potential signaling pathways involved in the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1, we determined PI3K activity, Akt phosphorylation, and MAPK phosphorylation in wild-type, IRS-1 KO, and IRS-1 KO cells reconstituted with different IRS proteins (Fig.7). As all the IRS proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated by IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 4E"

In higher animals, exteroceptorstransduce external stimuli such as sound, vibration, touch, and local gravity, whereas interoceptors provide feedback for the voluntary musculature and autonomic signals that provide information on filling of the hollow organs (blood pressure regulation, filling of the bladder, etc.). Interoceptors include cellular transducers that permit local control of blood flow, dilation-induced changes in heart rate, and regulation of cell volume and thirst; hormonal-coupled transducers that convert mechanical stimuli into release of factors such as renin and atrial naturietic factor; and autocrine and paracrine transducers that are responsible for local secretion of agents such as endothelin and other growth factors and gene regulators that affect cell division and cell size, as in bone and muscle growth. MSCs are the only known primary mechanical transducers and may drive many of these processes. The three-dimensional structure of a bacterial MSC is known (2Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), but in eukaryotes, the only MSCs that have been cloned are a family of K+-selective channels (3Patel A.J.

They can be classified in a broad spectrum as stretch-activated channels (SACs) and stretch-inactivated channels. Some of each are K+-selective, and others are nonselective cation channels (6Hamill O.P. Martinac B. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 685-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Despite the widespread nature of mechanical transduction in biology, no specific activator or inhibitors of MSCs have been known until recently. Gd3+ (10–20 μm) inhibits SACs in both plant and animal cells, suggesting a functional homology between the channels, but Gd3+ is not specific for SACs; nor can it be considered a useful lead compound for the development of therapeutic agents. Furthermore, it is not clear if the effects of Gd3+are directly on SACs or mediated by a stiffening of membrane lipids (7Ermakov Y.A. Averbakh A.Z. Yusipovich A.I. Sukharev S. Biophys.

Rev. 1996; 48: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar) can inhibit SACs, but again they lack specificity. Recently, we discovered a family of peptides from the venom of the Chilean rose tarantula,Grammostola spatulata, that inhibit SACs in astrocytes and heart cells. The more potent of these toxins, GsMTx-4, not only blocks MSC currents seen with patch clamp recording but exhibits effects at the cellular level that appear to involve MSC activation. GsMTx-4 can reduce the cell size in swollen and hypertrophic heart cells, decrease volume-activated currents in astrocytes (14Suchyna T.M. Johnson J.H. Hamer K. Leykam J.F. Gage D.A. Clemo H.F. Baumgarten C.M. Sachs F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and inhibit stretch-induced arrhythmias in the heart (15Bode F. Sachs F. Franz M.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 35-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We have determined the solution structure of GsMTx-4 and a lower affinity inhibitor (GsMTx-2) using homonuclear and heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The backbone folds of both peptides exhibit the inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) motif, which is characteristic of a family of invertebrate toxins directed toward a variety of ion channels (16Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 17Norton R.S. Pallaghy P.K. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1573-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) as well as at least one mammalian protein (18McNulty J.C. Thompson D.A. Bolin K.A. Wilken J. Barsh G.S. Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15520-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A dominant feature of the structures is a hydrophobic patch, similar to that described for Hanatoxin (19Takahashi H. Kim J.I. Min H.J. Sato K. Swartz K.J. Shimada I. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), encompassing most of the aromatic residues that have been suggested to be important for toxin-receptor interaction. As with Hanatoxin, MSC peptides have charged residues surrounding the hydrophobic patch, but the distribution of the charges differs between GsMTx-4 and GsMTx-2, suggesting structural correlates that may account for differences in affinity. Hanatoxin is ineffective on MSCs. The ICK motif can be viewed as a well defined scaffold upon which side chains are placed to produce specificity for a particular target. Knowing the structure of MSC-directed ICK peptides, we can design modified structures that are labeled with various indicators, peptides that have higher affinity, and peptides that have differing specificity within the family of MSCs. A high affinity tag may allow isolation of this very difficult group of ion channels. The method for venom fractionation and toxin isolation is described in detail by Suchyna et al.(14Suchyna T.M. Johnson J.H. Hamer K. Leykam J.F. Gage D.A. Clemo H.F. Baumgarten C.M. Sachs F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, G. spatulata (Theraphosidae) spider venom was produced by an electrical milking procedure (20Bascur L. Yevenes I. Adrian H. Toxicon. 1980; 18: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. The venom was fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography, incorporating Beckman System Gold 126 solvent delivery and 168 photodiode array detector modules (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) using linear gradients of solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). A Zorbax RX-C8 (9.4 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å; Mac-Mod Analytical, Inc., Chadds Ford, PA) reversed-phase column was used in conjunction with a 40-min linear gradient (15–55% B) with a flow rate of 3.5 ml/min. Fractions were lyophilized and tested for MSC blocking activity on outside-out patches. Fractions that tested positive were further fractionated with slower gradients on a Vydac C18 column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å; The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) until a single component was isolated that showed blocking activity. The purity of specific peaks was assessed by analytical chromatography on a Jupiter C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a 40-min gradient of 20–28% B. The average yield of GsMTx-4 and GsMTx-2 from several purifications was ∼8 and ∼24 mg/ml of venom fractionated, respectively. Thus, GsMTx-4 is at least 2 mmin whole venom, whereas GsMTx-2 is at least 6 mm. 0.5 μl of the sample solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was mixed on the sample plate with 0.5 μl of a saturated solution of 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnaminic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing insulin as the internal calibrant. The solution was air-dried before introduction into the mass spectrometer. Spectra were acquired on a PerSeptive Voyager-DE STR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight instrument operated in reflectron delayed extraction mode (200 ns). The instrument was equipped with a nitrogen laser (3-ns pulse, 1950 power). The accelerating potential was 25 kV, and the grid voltage was 72%. The toxin was further purified by microbore reversed-phase HPLC (0.8 × 250-mm C18 column, with a linear gradient from 15–70% B over 90 min, with a flow rate of 40 μl/min, monitored at 214 nm). The toxin peak was collected at 24.6 min. The HPLC fraction (∼1 nmol) was dried down and taken up in 80 μl of 8m guanidine-HCl, 100 mm Tris, 5 mmtributylphosphine at pH 8.5 and incubated for 8 h at 55 °C.N-Isopropyliodoactamide (1 mg in 20 μl of MeOH plus 80 μl of Tris) was added, and the solution was incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The reduced and alkylated peptide was then desalted by HPLC on a C18 column as described above (elution time 30.1 min). N-terminal sequencing was carried out on an ABI 477 after loading the reduced and alkylated peptide on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Digestion with BNPS-skatole was carried out by dissolving the purified reduced and alkylated peptide in 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 15 μl of BNPS-skatole. The solution was incubated at room temperature for 8 h. The digestion products were separated by HPLC as described above. Two main peaks were collected and sequenced by Edman degradation. Asp-N digestion was performed by dissolving the purified reduced and alkylated peptide in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and treating with 1% (w/w) Asp-N for 20 h at 35 °C. The fragments were separated and analyzed by mass spectrometry prior to Edman degradation. For mass spectrometry, 1 μl of the sample solutions (intact toxin or fragments) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (or the HPLC elution solvent) were mixed on the sample plate with 1 μl of a saturated solution of 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The solution was allowed to air-dry before being introduced into the mass spectrometer. Activated adult astrocytes isolated from gelatin-sponge implants taken from adult Sprague-Dawley rat brain were generously provided by Dr. Thomas Langan (SUNY Buffalo) at passage numbers 2–4. Astrocytes were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and were used in experiments between 2 and 5 days after passage. Cells between passages 4 and 35 expressed SACs with the same properties. Flat, polygonal, fibroblast-like cells and stellate cells were used. An Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) amplifier was used for patch clamping, whereas experimental protocols and data acquisition were controlled by Axon Instruments pClamp8 software via a Digidata 1322A acquisition system. Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and low pass-filtered at 2 kHz through the four-pole Bessel filter on the Axopatch 200B. All potentials are defined with respect to the extracellular surface. Electrodes were pulled on a model PC-84 pipette puller (Brown-Flaming Instruments, CA), painted with Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI) and fire-polished. Electrodes were filled with KCl saline (140 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgSO4, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3) and had resistances ranging from 6 to 8 megaohms. Bath saline consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 6 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3. Pressure and suction were applied to the pipette by a HSPC-1 pressure clamp (ALA Scientific Instruments) controlled by the pClamp software. Perfusion of toxin samples was performed by a pressurized local perfusion system BPS-8 (ALA Scientific Instruments) with eight separate channels. Off-line data analysis was performed with Clampfit and Origin 6.1 software. In order to determine whether the proteins were aggregated, the coefficients of self-diffusion (Dt) for GsMTx2 and GsMTx4 were measured using a longitudinal encode-decode pulse sequence (21Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar) with the proteins lyophilized and resuspended in D2O. Lysozyme was used as a standard control for slope calibration. Dt for 2 mm lysozyme in a1H2O/2H2O mixture at 298 K was taken to be 1.08 × 10−6 cm2s−1 (21Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Data from experiments utilizing 10 different gradient strengths, ranging from 4 to 60 gauss, were analyzed. Increments of 1/8, 1/4, ½, and 3/4 maximum were run in triplicate to provide estimates of error in the exponential fit. Peak intensities were fit to the equation,ln(I)=ln(I0)+G2γ2δ2(Δ/3−δ/3)DtEquation 1 where I represents measured peak intensity,G is the gradient strength in gauss/cm, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of protons (26,753 radian s−1G−1), δ is the length of the gradient pulse (1.5 ms), Δ is the diffusion time between gradients (600 ms), andDt is the self-diffusion rate. Samples from the Vydac C18 column were lyophilized and resuspended in distilled H2O to 2 mm toxin. The samples were then titrated to pH 4.5, and D2O was added to 8%. A 250-μl aliquot of the protein solution was transferred to a 5-mm Shigemi tube for NMR spectroscopy. All experiments were performed on Varian Inova 600 and 500 spectrometers equipped with triple resonance Z-gradient probes at the Cornell Biomolecular NMR Center. Data were collected in States-TPPI mode (22States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) for quadrature detection. Homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY (23Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wu¨thrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar), TOCSY (24Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Mag. Res. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3111) Google Scholar), and COSY (25Aue W.P. Bartholdi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2229-2246Crossref Scopus (3098) Google Scholar) spectra were obtained at 5, 16, 20, 25, and 35 °C with presaturation during the recycle period followed by SCUBA recovery (26Brown S.C. Weber P.L. Mueller L. J. Mag. Res. 1988; 77: 166-169Google Scholar). A DIPSI-2 (27Rucker S.P. Shaka A.J. Mol. Phys. 1989; 68: 509-517Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar) sequence of 60–90 ms was used in the TOCSY experiments, and a 150-ms mixing period was used in the NOESY experiments. Two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC and1H,13C HSQC (28Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2435) Google Scholar) spectra were acquired with natural abundance proteins. Data were processed either with a modification of version 2.3 of Felix software (Accelrys, Inc.) or NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11632) Google Scholar). Sparky (30Goddard, T. D., and Kneller, D. G., Sparky, Version 3, University of California, San FranciscoGoogle Scholar) was used for data visualization, assignments, and peak integration. Dihedral angle constraints were obtained from the chemical shift index (31Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 32Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar, 33Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar) and from measurements of coupling constants using a two-dimensional COSY experiment with 8192 points in t2. Stereospecific assignments and χ1 constraints were determined using an exclusive COSY (34Griesinger C. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Res. 1987; 75: 747-792Google Scholar) and the NOESY experiments. Distance constraints for structural calculations were obtained from a series of two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY experiments at 5–35 °C in either 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O. Distance constraints were classified into four categories according to the intensity of the NOE cross-peak (<2.4, <3.4, <4.0, and <5.5 Å). On the basis of the chemical shift index and coupling constants from a high resolution COSY experiment, backbone dihedral angles were constrained to favorable regions of φ,ψ space: α-helix, φ, −80 ± 30°; ψ, −20 ± 30°; β-strand, φ, −105 ± 65°; ψ, 145 ± 45° (35Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4470) Google Scholar). χ1 constraints and stereospecific assignments of β protons were made based on the exclusive COSY and NOESY spectra (36Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Schaumann T., Go, N. Wu¨thrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The distance and dihedral restraints were used as inputs to determine preliminary structures using the distance geometry/simulated annealing protocol in CNS 1.0 (Crystallography and NMR System) (37Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding constraints were added in subsequent calculations based on deuterium exchange data, characteristic NOE patterns (see Fig. 3), and likely hydrogen bonding partners determined from the preliminary structures. Three hundred structures were calculated using CNS, and the 20 lowest energy structures were aligned to the average structure using XPLOR version 3.851 (38Brunger A.T. Xplor Manual: Version 3.843. Yale University, 1996Google Scholar). The structures were visualized using Swiss-PdbView (39Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Procheck-NMR, Aqua (35Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4470) Google Scholar), and NMRCLUST (40Kelley L.A. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The hydrogen-bonding pattern was verified by recalculating a set of 200 structures without the hydrogen bonding constraints. The 20 lowest energy structures were analyzed. The NH and carbonyl oxygens of the hydrogen bonding pairs were oriented correctly in almost all structures, although in some cases, the distance between the NH and oxygen was somewhat greater than that observed when the hydrogen bonding constraints were included in the calculation. G. spatulatawhole venom was fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC, and fractions were superfused onto outside-out patches from rat astrocytes to assess MSC activity. Fractions that showed activity were again fractionated on successively shallower gradients until a single active component was isolated. Suchyna et al. (14Suchyna T.M. Johnson J.H. Hamer K. Leykam J.F. Gage D.A. Clemo H.F. Baumgarten C.M. Sachs F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) described the properties and primary structure of GsMTx-4, a peptide with the highest affinity of any known blocker of MSCs. At a concentration of 5 μm, GsMTx-4 blocked ∼92% of the MSC current with an association rate of 3.4 × 105m−1s−1 (Fig. 1A). The ratio of association and dissociation rates produced an equilibrium constant of ∼500 nm. A similar number resulted from treating the reaction as a simple bimolecular reaction and using the residual (steady state) current as a measure of the unbound fraction (see Figs. 5 and 6 in Suchyna et al. (14Suchyna T.M. Johnson J.H. Hamer K. Leykam J.F. Gage D.A. Clemo H.F. Baumgarten C.M. Sachs F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar)). The largest HPLC peak in Grammostola whole venom was actually a complex of several peaks, one of which could block MSCs but showed lower activity than GsMtx-4. The active peak eluted at 21.5 min on a 15–50% acetonitrile 40-min linear gradient (see Fig. 3A in Ref. 14Suchyna T.M. Johnson J.H. Hamer K. Leykam J.F. Gage D.A. Clemo H.F. Baumgarten C.M. Sachs F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). At 5 μm, this peptide (designated GsMTx-2) blocks ∼45% of the MSC current with an association rate constant of 1.7 × 105m−1 s−1 (Fig. 1B). Assuming a single binding site, the ratio of the residual unblocked steady state current (I) to the peak current in the absence of toxin (Io) is I/Io= 1/(1 + T/KD), where T is the toxin concentration. For 5 μm GsMTx-2,I/Io is 0.55, giving aKD of ∼6 μm. Thus, the affinity of GsMTx-2 for astrocyte MSCs is ∼12 times lower than that of GsMTx-4. The sequence of GsMTx-2 has less than 25% homology to GsMTx-4 as shown at thebottom of the sequence alignment in Fig. 1C. The four ICK tarantula peptides shown in the middle of Fig.1C have the highest sequence similarity to GsMTx-4 (and higher than that of GsMTx-2) but are not mechanotoxins (toxins that inhibit MSCs). Given that the peptides that are not mechanotoxins have much higher sequence similarity to GsMTx-4 than GsMTx-2, the structures of GsMTx-2 and GsMTx-4 may provide clues as to the origin of specificity for MSCs. Of the peptide sequences shown, three-dimensional structures only exist for Hanatoxin, GsMTx-2, and GsMTx-4 (see below). For these three peptides, the hydrophobic amino acids that form a cluster on the surface of the three peptides are shown in green (Fig. 1). Assuming structural homology, the corresponding hydrophobic amino acids on the other three toxins (TXP5, SNX-482, and ω-GsTx-S1A) are also shown in green. The hydrophobic patch of Hanatoxin has been suggested to be part of the channel-binding domain, based on homology to other toxins. The charged residues that surround the hydrophobic patch are shown in blue (+) and lavender (−), but since their sequence positions vary significantly, the charges are only marked on the toxins where structures are known. In order to determine whether GsMTx2 and GsMTx4 were aggregated in the samples used for NMR spectroscopy,Dt was measured at 500 MHz using a pulsed field gradient method (21Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar) with lysozyme as a standard. Plots of ln(I) versus G2 (Equation 1) were linear over the range of gradient strengths used for experiments for all three proteins (the two toxins and lysozyme). The averageDt for GsMTx2 was 2.26 × 10−6cm2 s−1, and that for GsMTx4 was 2.22 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. Using the known hydrodynamic radius of lysozyme (Rh = 20.5 Å),Rh of GsMTx2 and GsMTx4 could be estimated as ∼12.8 and 13.3 Å, respectively (41Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). These values are what would be expected given the empirical relationship, Rh = 4.75n0.29, for the hydrodynamic radius of a globular protein having n = 31 and 35 amino acids (41Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Likewise, these values are consistent with the overall shape and dimensions of the calculated structures described below, confirming that, under the conditions used, both toxins are monomeric. Sequence-specific resonance assignments (excluding the first residue) were made for both peptides using both homonuclear and heteronuclear experiments. A natural abundance 1H,15N HSQC experiment provided a fingerprint of the amide nitrogen and amide proton correlation for each residue except proline (Fig.2). Homonuclear TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and NOESY experiments were then used to do the bulk of the assignments, which employed standard techniques (42Wu¨thrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The assignments were assisted by the analysis of a 1H,13C HSQC spectrum. Using the proton chemical shifts in this spectrum, the peaks could be assigned to a particular spin system by comparison with the TOCSY experiment. The corresponding carbon chemical shift of the Cα and Cβ could then be used to aid in identification of the amino acid type. Backbone NOEs used to make sequential assignments and to aid in the assignment of hydrogen bonds are summarized in Fig. 3A. Using chemical shift index analysis and analysis of the high resolution DQF-COSY spectra, a total of 14 (GsMTx-4) and 17 (GsMTx-2) φ,ψ distance constraints were obtained. Characteristic of the ICK motif, both GsMTx-2 and GsMTx-4 exhibit three disulfide bonds in relatively close proximity. For GsMTx-4, if the structures are calculated without assuming a disulfide-bonding pattern, the bond between Cys2 and Cys17 can clearly be assigned due to the proximity of the two side chains and an NOE between an Hβ of Cys2 and an Hβ of Cys17. Of the remaining four cysteines, Cys9 is positioned close to both Cys30 and Cys23(3.69 ± 0.32 Å and 4.13 ± 0.69 Å, respectively). If one assumes a disulfide bond between Cys9 and Cys30, then Cys16 and Cys23 would not be positioned correctly to form a disulfide (9.51 ± 0.99 Å apart). On the other hand, if Cys9 formed a disulfide with Cys23, then Cys30 could easily form a disulfide with Cys16. This pattern is supported by an observed NOE between an Hβ of Cys16 and an Hβ of Cys30. The lowest energy structures and lowest r.m.s. deviations were obtained from structures with explicit disulfides between Cys9–Cys23 and Cys16–Cys30 as opposed to the two other possible patterns (Cys9–Cys30/Cys16–Cys23and Cys9–Cys16/Cys23–Cys30). In order to test this pattern further, structures were calculated, restraining the disulfide dihedral to within ±10° of the ideal values (i.e. 90 ± 10° and −90 ± 10°). 50 structures were calculated for each of three combinations of disulfide bonds holding 2–17 constant (Cys9–Cys23/Cys16–Cys30, Cys9–Cys30/Cys16–Cys23, and Cys9–Cys16/Cys23–Cys30) and each of eight combinations of two dihedral constraints (90 ± 10° and −90 ± 10°) on the three disulfides (i.e.400 structures for each of the three disulfide-bonding patterns). For Cys2–Cys17/Cys9–Cys30/Cys16–Cys23, less than 3% of the structures had no NOE violations, and all had relatively high overall energies. Both Cys2–Cys17/Cys9–Cys23/Cys16-Cys30and"
https://openalex.org/W2005225965,"The novel protein kinase C (nPKC) isoforms are important regulators of human involucrin (hINV) gene expression during keratinocyte differentiation (Efimova, T., and Eckert, R. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 1601–1607). Although the regulatory mechanism involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, the role of individual MAPK isoforms has not been elucidated. We therefore examined the effects of individual nPKCs on MAPK activation. We observe unique changes whereby nPKC expression simultaneously increases p38 activity and decreases ERK1 and ERK2 activity. Although p38α, p38β, and p38δ are expressed in keratinocytes, only a single isoform, p38δ, accounts for the increased p38 activity. Parallel studies indicate that this isoform is also activated by treatment with the keratinocyte regulatory agents, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, calcium, and okadaic acid. These changes in MAPK activity are associated with increased C/EBPα transcription factor expression and DNA binding to the hINV promoter and increased hINV gene expression. Expression of PKCδ, PKCε, or PKCη causes a 10-fold increase in hINV promoter activity, whereas C/EBPα expression produces a 25-fold increase. However, simultaneous expression of both proteins causes a synergistic 100-fold increase in promoter activity. These responses are eliminated by the dominant-negative C/EBP isoform, GADD153, and are also inhibited by dominant-negative forms of Ras, MEKK1, MEK3, and p38. These results suggest that the nPKC isoforms produce a unique shift in MAPK activity via a Ras, MEKK1, MEK3 pathway, to increase p38δ and inhibit ERK1/2 and ultimately increase C/EBPα binding to the hINV promoter and hINV gene expression. The novel protein kinase C (nPKC) isoforms are important regulators of human involucrin (hINV) gene expression during keratinocyte differentiation (Efimova, T., and Eckert, R. L. (2000) J. Biol.

Although p38α, p38β, and p38δ are expressed in keratinocytes, only a single isoform, p38δ, accounts for the increased p38 activity. Parallel studies indicate that this isoform is also activated by treatment with the keratinocyte regulatory agents, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, calcium, and okadaic acid. These changes in MAPK activity are associated with increased C/EBPα transcription factor expression and DNA binding to the hINV promoter and increased hINV gene expression. Expression of PKCδ, PKCε, or PKCη causes a 10-fold increase in hINV promoter activity, whereas C/EBPα expression produces a 25-fold increase. However, simultaneous expression of both proteins causes a synergistic 100-fold increase in promoter activity. These responses are eliminated by the dominant-negative C/EBP isoform, GADD153, and are also inhibited by dominant-negative forms of Ras, MEKK1, MEK3, and p38. These results suggest that the nPKC isoforms produce a unique shift in MAPK activity via a Ras, MEKK1, MEK3 pathway, to increase p38δ and inhibit ERK1/2 and ultimately increase C/EBPα binding to the hINV promoter and hINV gene expression. protein kinase C conventional/classical PKC atypical PKC novel PKC human involucrin mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK/ERK kinase constitutively active MEK MEK kinase 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate multiplicity of infection c-Jun N-terminal kinase dominant-negative CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Protein kinase C (PKC)1 family members are classified into three major groups. The conventional/classical PKCs (cPKCα, cPKCβI, cPKCβII, and cPKCγ) are calcium-, diacylglycerol-, and phospholipid-dependent kinases; the atypical PKC kinases (aPKCζ and aPKCλ) are calcium- and diacylglycerol-independent (1Newton A.C.

In previous studies, we demonstrated that the novel PKC isoforms PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCη, but not the conventional and atypical PKC forms, activate keratinocyte differentiation as measured by effects on human involucrin (hINV) gene expression (10Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Deucher A. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17032-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Involucrin is a precursor of the keratinocyte-cornified envelope and a marker of early keratinocyte differentiation (12Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative PKCδ inhibits this response (10Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This pathway appears to operate by triggering a cascade that includes Ras, MEKK1, and MEK3. Although this pathway is known to require MAPK activity, whether individual nPKCs activate different MAPKs has not been explored. In the present study we activate the signaling cascades at the PKC level by expression of individual nPKC isoforms in keratinocytes and monitor the effects on MAPK function and downstream responses. Our results show that nPKC activation results in increased p38δ MAPK activity and reduced ERK1/2 activity. No change in activity of other p38 isoforms (p38α and p38β) is observed. This combination of changes leads to increased C/EBPα transcription factor expression and activity and increased hINV gene expression. These results suggest that nPKC inhibits ERK1/2 expression and activates p38δ via a Ras, MEKK1, MEK3 pathway that targets C/EBPα to increase hINV gene expression.

The final DNA concentrations in all groups were adjusted to identical levels using empty expression vector. The luciferase activity was assayed immediately using a Promega luciferase assay kit and a Berthold luminometer. All of the assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Luciferase activity was normalized per μg of protein as described previously (10Efimova T.

Transfection efficiency was monitored using a green fluorescent protein expression plasmid. nPKC-expressing adenoviruses were previously constructed (26Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S.

Adenoviruses encoding constitutively active MEK6 and wild type FLAG-tagged p38 MAPK isoforms α, β, γ, and δ were obtained from Dr. Y. Wang (27Wang Y., Su, B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J.

A control (empty) adenovirus, Ad5-EV, was generated by recombining pCA3 plasmid with the pJM17 adenovirus backbone. Recombinant adenoviruses were propagated in 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride centrifugation. The optimal multiplicity of adenoviral infection was determined using the green fluorescent protein-encoding adenovirus. The adenoviruses were administered at the indicated MOI in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml polybrene. Total cell or nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured human epidermal keratinocytes as described previously (15Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Equal quantities of protein were electrophoresed on a 10% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked, incubated with an indicated primary antibody, washed, and exposed to an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Secondary antibody binding was visualized using chemiluminescent detection methods (29Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The activities of MAPKs were measured using nonisotopic p44/42 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and JNK/stress-activated protein kinase assay methods (New England Biolabs) (25Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocyte total cell lysates were prepared under nondenaturing conditions. Equal amounts of total protein (200 μg) were used per each kinase assay. Immobilized, dual phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-p38 MAPK monoclonal antibodies were used to selectively immunoprecipitate active (phosphorylated) ERK1/2 and p38 kinases, respectively. JNK/stress-activated protein kinase was selectively precipitated from cell lysates using c-Jun fusion protein glutathione-Sepharose beads. Precipitated kinases were then allowed to phosphorylate substrate proteins (Elk-1 for ERK1/2, ATF-2 for p38, and c-Jun for JNK/stress-activated protein kinase) in a kinase reaction performed in the presence of ATP. Phosphorylation of the substrate proteins was analyzed by immunoblot using phosphorylated substrate-specific antibodies. The activity of adenovirus-delivered FLAG-tagged p38 MAPK isoforms was measured by precipitating the tagged kinases using anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (F3165; Sigma). Expression of individual FLAG-p38 isoforms was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-FLAG antibody. To measure the activity of endogenous p38δ isoform, p38δ-specific antibody (SC-7585) was used to selectively immunoprecipitate this enzyme followed by a kinase assay performed as outlined above. The gel mobility shift assay was performed exactly as previously outlined (14Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using a double-stranded, 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide, 5′-GGTTTGCTGCTTAAGATGCCTG-3′ (C/EBP site is in bold), that encodes the hINV C/EBP-binding site region (15Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To identify the mechanism whereby the nPKC isoforms regulate gene expression during keratinocyte differentiation, we transfected keratinocytes with empty adenovirus or adenovirus encoding PKCδ or PKCη. At 48 h, the cells were harvested, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed by immunoprecipitating the activated forms of all p38 isoforms using anti-phospho-p38. Kinase activity was then measured based on the ability of the precipitated kinase to phosphorylate ATF-2. Parallel assays were performed to measure ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 activity. As shown in Fig.1A, PKCη and PKCδ markedly increase p38 activity. In contrast, ERK1/2 activity is suppressed (P-ELK1). JNK activity was not detected (P-c-Jun). To assure that the observed changes in kinase activity were not due to regulation of kinase level, we measured endogenous kinase levels by immunoblot. Fig. 1B shows that nPKC expression does not alter the level of p38, JNK1/2, or ERK1/2. To evaluate whether the decline in overall ERK activity is selectively associated with reduced ERK1 or ERK2 activity, we compared total ERK1/2 and P-ERK1/2 levels by immunoblot. Fig. 1C shows that although total ERK1/2 levels are not altered by PKCδ or η treatment, both isoforms are proportionately reduced in activity as measured by diminished levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2). Fig. 1A shows that JNK1/2 is not active. Thus, as a positive control to assure that the JNK assay is functional, we treated keratinocytes for 24 h with okadaic acid, prepared extracts, and assayed JNK activity. As shown in Fig.1D, okadaic acid-dependent JNK activity is readily detected, confirming the validity of the assay. Finally, it is important to confirm that the vector-delivered proteins are expressed. Thus, extracts were prepared from adenovirus expression vector-infected cells, and the level of PKC isoform expression was monitored by immunoblot. The blot shown in Fig. 1E confirms that PKCδ and η are expressed. It should be noted that, as expected (10Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), endogenous PKCη expression is detected when the film exposure time is extended, and overexpression of selected PKC isoforms does not affect the expression of the endogenously expressed PKCs (not shown). Taken together, these results provide evidence that nPKC isoforms δ and η activate p38, inhibit ERK1/2, and have no effect on JNK1/2 activity. p38 MAPK exists as a family of four distinct isoforms (α, β, δ, and γ) that have different biological functions (30Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). To identify which p38 isoform is activated by PKCη and δ, keratinocytes were infected with FLAG-tagged p38α, β, γ, or δ in the presence of empty virus or virus encoding PKCη or PKCδ. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and individual FLAG-p38 isoforms were precipitated using anti-FLAG antibody and assayed for the ability to phosphorylate ATF-2 (29Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27214-27220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that adenovirus-delivered FLAG-p38α, γ, and δ are active in control (empty virus infected) cultures and that p38δ and γ activities are increased in the presence of nPKC expression. In contrast, no p38β activity is detected for any of the treatment conditions. Our previous study using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR indicates that p38γ is not expressed in keratinocytes (29Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the only p38 isoform that is increased in activity in response to nPKC is p38δ. To confirm that the vector-delivered p38 isoforms are expressed, we prepared cell extracts and performed immunoblots using a FLAG-specific antibody. Fig.2B shows that, with the exception of p38γ, which is expressed at higher levels, each FLAG-p38 isoform is expressed at a relatively similar level. The above results suggest that p38δ is the major p38 isoform activated by PKCδ and η. To determine whether endogenous p38δ behaves in a similar manner, we infected keratinocytes with empty vector or vectors encoding PKCδ or PKCη. After 48 h, endogenous p38δ was selectively immunoprecipitated, and p38δ activity was assayed based on the ability to phosphorylate ATF-2. As shown in Fig. 2C, PKCδ and η stimulate the activation of endogenous p38δ. In contrast, the dominant-negative forms of PKCδ and η (dnPKCδ and dnPKCη) do not regulate p38δ activity, suggesting that this regulation requires nPKC activity. To assure that these changes in p38δ activity are not the results of altered p38δ levels, we prepared extracts from cells at 48 h after nPKC-encoding virus infection and measured p38δ levels by immunoblot. The middle panel of Fig. 2C shows that PKC expression does not alter p38δ levels. The bottom panel is a β-actin immunoblot that is included to assure even loading. If nPKC activation is important for response to agents that regulate keratinocyte differentiation, we would anticipate that treatment with these agents would produce a change in MAPK activity similar to that of expression of nPKC isoforms. To address this issue, cells were infected with a FLAG-p38δ encoding adenovirus. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 0.3 mm calcium, 100 nm okadaic acid, or 50 ng/ml TPA, agents that regulate nPKC activity or the activity of enzymes immediately downstream of the nPKCs. At the indicated times, the extracts were prepared, and FLAG-38δ was precipitated and assayed for activity. As measured by the ability to phosphorylate ATF-2, each of these agents induced strong and sustained activation of p38δ; however, the time course of the calcium-dependent activation was slower (Fig.3A). It should be noted that okadaic acid- and TPA-dependent p38δ activity was maximally increased by 6 h and remained maximal until 24 h (not shown). ERK1/2 activity was measured directly by monitoring the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 following treatment for the time indicated. Fig. 3B shows that phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 levels are reduced by TPA and okadaic acid treatment. However, calcium did not reduce the level of phosphorylated ERK1 or ERK2. These changes in p38δ and ERK1/2 activity were not associated with changes in p38δ or ERK1/2 levels as measured by immunoblot (not shown). The above results suggest that both differentiating agents and nPKC isoforms regulate MAPKs in similar manners. An important aspect of how the nPKC-dependent MAPK cascades regulate keratinocyte differentiation is identification of the downstream targets that mediates activation of differentiation-dependent gene expression. C/EBPα has been proposed as a key transcriptional regulator of differentiation (15Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Maytin E.V. Habener J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 238-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 33Maytin E.V. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our previous study suggests that TPA-dependent regulation of differentiation-associated gene expression requires C/EBPα activity (15Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We next determined whether nPKC isoforms regulate C/EBP function. We infected keratinocytes with native or dominant-negative forms of PKCδ or η, and after 48 h monitored C/EBPα level. Fig.4A shows that C/EBPα, consistent with previous reports (15Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), is expressed in control (empty vector-infected) cells. The present experiment shows that this expression is markedly increased by PKCδ and PKCη and markedly reduced by expression of dnPKCδ or dnPKCη. Thus, C/EBPα levels increase in a PKCδ and PKCη-dependent manner. Based on the above results, we suggest that PKCδ and η increase C/EBPα expression via a p38δ-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we infected keratinocytes with empty adenovirus or adenoviruses encoding p38δ, constitutively active MEK6 (caMEK6), or both. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and the C/EBPα levels were monitored by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 4B, adenovirus-dependent expression of p38δ causes a marked increase in C/EBPα level. This experiment also demonstrates that caMEK6 enhances C/EBPα expression. MEK6 is a MAPK kinase that is an immediate upstream activator of p38 (30Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 31Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27214-27220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the fact that p38δ increases C/EBPα expression that is further increased when both MEK6 and p38δ are present further suggests that the C/EBPα increase is p38δ-dependent. The above studies suggest that nPKCs, via activation of p38δ and C/EBPα, regulate differentiation-associated gene expression in keratinocytes. To evaluate the impact of this regulation on differentiation, we studied involucrin gene expression. Involucrin is a marker of keratinocyte differentiation that is regulated via a C/EBPα-dependent mechanism (15Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We transfected keratinocytes with pINV-241, a luciferase-linked hINV promoter reporter plasmid (14Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The cells were then treated with expression plasmids encoding PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, or C/EBPα. As shown in Fig. 5A, C/EBPα expression causes a 25-fold increase in promoter activity, whereas each nPKC isoform (nPKCδ, ε, and η) produces a 10-fold activity increase. Remarkably, simultaneous expression of nPKC with C/EBPα results in a >100-fold activation. The inset of Fig. 5A confirms by immunoblot that each of the three PKC isoforms tested (δ, ε, η) and C/EBPα are expressed at appropriate levels from the delivery vector. To confirm the importance of C/EBPα for PKC-dependent activation of gene expression, we treated pINV-241-transfected cells with PKCδ, ε, or η in the presence or absence of a dominant-inactivating C/EBP form, GADD153 (34Ron D.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and monitored the effects on promoter activity. We first confirmed (Fig. 5B, inset) that vector-produced GADD153 does accumulate within the cell. Fig. 5B shows that GADD153 completely suppresses the PKC-dependent increase in transcriptional activity. Thus, functional C/EBPα protein is required for PKC-dependent gene activation. We next tested the ability of nPKC isoforms and C/EBPα to activate a hINV promoter construct that contains a mutated C/EBP transcription factor-binding site. As shown in Fig. 5C, mutation of this site eliminates the ability of the nPKCs and C/EBPα to enhance gene expression. The results presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that PKCδ and η increase C/EBPα expression. To further assess the importance of this increase for regulation of hINV transcription, we measured C/EBPα binding to the C/EBP-binding site in PKCδ- or PKCη-expressing cells. A 32P-labeled oligonucleotide encoding the hINV promoter C/EBP-binding site (15Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

In order to delineate signaling pathways that link receptor-generated cAMP to the activation of MAP kinase, the human A2A-adenosine receptor, a prototypical Gs-coupled receptor, was heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (referred as CHO-A2A cells). In CHO-A2A cells, the stimulation of the A2A-receptor resulted in an activation of RAP1 and formation of RAP1-B-RAF complexes. However, overexpression of a RAP1 GTPase-activating protein (RAP1GAP), which efficiently clamped cellular RAP1 in the inactive GDP-bound form, did not affect A2A-agonist-mediated MAP kinase stimulation. In contrast, the inhibitor of protein kinase A H89 efficiently suppressed A2A-agonist-mediated MAP kinase stimulation. Neither dynamin-dependent receptor internalization nor receptor-promoted shedding of matrix-bound growth factors accounted for A2A-receptor-dependent MAP kinase activation. PP1, an inhibitor of SRC family kinases, blunted both the A2A-receptor- and the forskolin-induced MAP kinase stimulation (IC50 = 50 nm); this was also seen in PC12 cells, which express the A2A-receptor endogenously, and in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, in which cAMP causes MAP kinase stimulation. In the corresponding murine fibroblast cell line SYF, which lacks the ubiquitously expressed SRC family kinases SRC, YES, and FYN, forskolin barely stimulated MAP kinase; this reduction was reversed in cells in which c-SRC had been reintroduced. These findings show that activation of MAP kinase by cAMP requires a SRC family kinase that lies downstream of protein kinase A.

This effect is thought to reflect, at least in part, the ability of protein kinase A (PKA)1-dependent phosphorylation to disrupt the interaction between p21ras and c-RAF; this results in cAMP-mediated suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (1Wu J.

However, in some cells, agonist occupancy of Gs-coupled receptors is associated with both increases in cellular cAMP and with stimulation of MAP kinase. It has been argued that stimulation of MAP kinase is dependent on cAMP and that effectors other than adenylyl cyclase generate the signal that link Gs-coupled receptor to MAP kinase activation. Furthermore, in each of the proposed models, the signal to MAP kinase diverges at a different level from the signaling cascade composed of receptor, Gs, and adenylyl cyclase/cAMP. (i) The cAMP-dependent signaling mechanism is mediated by the p21ras-related, monomeric G protein RAP1 that preferentially activates B-RAF (5Ohtsuka T. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Loading of RAP1A with GTP requires guanine nucleotide exchange factors, a class of which (Epac) is directly activated by cAMP, i.e. in a manner independent of PKA (7de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.

Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). (ii) Alternatively, a role has been invoked for the non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC, because Gαs directly binds to and activates SRC in vitro (9Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In this case, stimulation of MAP kinase by Gs-coupled receptors is independent of cAMP but sensitive to inhibition or genetic ablation of SRC. (iii) A large set of experiments support a third model of MAP kinase activation in which the receptor is endocytosed in a dynamin-dependent fashion. Here β-arrestin functions as adapter protein for the recruitment of SRC and for the assembly of a large signaling complex. This model has been primarily developed with the β2-adrenergic receptor (10McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and predicts that stimulation of MAP kinase by the receptor is blocked by abrogating dynamin and SRC. (iv) Finally, G protein-coupled receptors may promote transactivation of tyrosine kinase receptors by causing the shedding of matrix-bound growth factors; this effect depends on the activation of matrix metalloproteases (11Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Although G protein-coupled receptors may recruit multiple and redundant pathways to stimulate MAP kinase (12Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), it is evident that some of the proposed mechanisms are mutually exclusive. It is also difficult to understand why protein kinase A is required for cAMP-dependent stimulation of MAP kinase (13Yao H. York R.D. Misra-Press A. Carr D.W. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) if GTP-liganded RAP1 is formed by the action of Epac (7de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H.

Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have therefore tested the predictions of the four models; we compared the action of receptor-independent elevations of cAMP (by membrane-permeable analogues and forskolin, the direct activator of adenylyl cyclase) with the effect of the A2A-adenosine receptor. This Gs-coupled receptor activates MAP kinase in CHO cells in a manner dependent on cAMP (14Seidel M.G. Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Holler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25833-25841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our experiments show that RAP1 and dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis are dispensable for receptor and cAMP-dependent activation of MAP kinase; similarly, MAP kinase stimulation cannot be accounted for by transactivation of a receptor tyrosine kinase due to release of a matrix-bound release growth factor. In contrast, SRC (or an SRC-like kinase) plays an essential role, but it is downstream of protein kinase A.

Shalloway, those encoding wild type and mutated versions of dynamin were kindly provided by C. van Koppen. In order to generate an alternative reporter MAP kinase, we amplified the cDNA encoding a hemagglutinin-tagged version of ERK1/p44 MAP kinase by PCR using the following primer (where underlines indicate the restriction sites for the enzymes shown in parentheses): ERK-5′-GCA GGAGCTCCG ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA (SacI); ERK-3′ GCA TGAATTCTC GGG GCC TCT GGT GCC CCT GG (EcoRI). The purified PCR fragment was ligated via theSacI-EcoRI restriction site into pGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, BD PharMingen) linking the HA-ERK in-frame to the amino terminus of the GFP protein. The sources for the other plasmids employed has been listed previously (14Seidel M.G. Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Holler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25833-25841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). CHO and HEK293 cells were propagated and transfected as outlined earlier (14Seidel M.G. Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Holler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25833-25841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). SYF and SYF + c-SRC cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium at 5% CO2 and 37 °C supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. PC12 cells were plated onto collagen-coated culture dishes and propagated in Opti-MEM medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For co-culture of CHO or CHO-A2A with reporter CHO cells, expressing reporter MAP kinase, CHO cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged reporter MAP kinase. After 24 h, the transfected reporter CHO cells were seeded with CHO-A2A or control CHO cells (ratio 1:1) and allowed to adhere for 12 h. Thereafter, the cells were rendered quiescent by withdrawing serum for 12 h, and MAP kinase assays were subsequently performed as described below. Confluent cell layers (in 6-cm dishes) were rendered quiescent by serum starvation for 12–24 h. The starving medium was supplemented with 1 unit/ml adenosine deaminase to remove any endogenously produced adenosine; 30 min prior to MAP kinase assays the medium was again changed against prewarmed (37 °C) medium in order to minimize basal activity. If not otherwise indicated, cells were subsequently stimulated by addition of medium containing or lacking agonists and maintained at 37 °C for 5 min. Control incubations were carried out in order to verify that the carry-over of dimethyl sulfoxide, which resulted in final concentrations of ≤0.1%, neither affected the basal levels of MAP kinase phosphorylation nor the response to agonists. The exposure to agonists or vehicle was terminated by rapidly rinsing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; thereafter, the dish was immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen; after rapid thawing, cells were lysed by addition of 80 μl of lysis buffer (in mm: 50 Tris, 40 β-glycerophosphate, 100 NaCl, 10 EDTA, 10 p-nitrophenol phosphate, 1 PMSF, 1 Na3VO4, 10 NaF, pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 250 units/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/μl leupeptin. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the total protein content was measured photometrically using bicinchoninic acid (Micro-BCA kit, Pierce). Aliquots corresponding to 2.5–5·104 cells (10–30 μg of protein) were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer containing 30 mm dithiothreitol and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels (monomer concentration 10–15% acrylamide, 0.26–0.4% bisacrylamide). MAP kinase phosphorylation was assayed by incubating nitrocellulose blots with an antiserum that recognizes only the dually phosphorylated forms of p42 and p44 MAP kinase; in order to rule out that the differences observed were due to the application of unequal amounts of lysates, control blots were also probed with an antiserum recognizing both the unphosphorylated (inactive) and phosphorylated (active form). The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. Immunodetection of the other proteins was performed in an analogous manner, using the appropriate antibodies or antisera. In several instances the reporter MAP kinase was first immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal 12CA5 antibody directed against the HA epitope and protein G-Sepharose that had been pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer; HA-tagged or HA-GFP-tagged ERK1 were used interchangeably with equivalent results. Co-immunoprecipitations of HA-tagged RAP1 with B-RAF were done in a similar manner. GST fusion protein of the minimal RAP1-binding domain of RalGDS (ral-RBD, see Ref. 15Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) were expressed in Escherichia coli (strain BL21DE3); following induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, bacterial lysates were prepared as described. GST fusion proteins were immobilized by incubating bacterial lysates for 1 h at 4 °C with GSH-Sepharose pre-equilibrated in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm PMSF. The Sepharose beads were washed 3 times in order to remove excess GST fusion protein. Cells were prepared for the assay in a similar way as outlined above for MAP kinase assays if not otherwise stated; incubation with agonists was carried out for 5 min followed by rapidly rinsing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and addition of RIPA buffer to achieve cell lysis. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 1 min). The resulting supernatants were incubated together with the GSH-Sepharose beads (50 μl of a 1:1 slurry containing about 10 μg of immobilized GST fusion protein) for 1 h to allow for the association of activated RAP1 with the RalGDS-GST fusion protein. Samples were washed 3 times in RIPA buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels; RAP1 was visualized using specific antibodies in a dilution of 1:250. If HA-tagged RAP1 was co-transfected, the assay was carried out in a similar way as described except that the transfection procedure preceded the assay and that the immunoblot was done with the 16B12 monoclonal antibody directed against HA tag sequence. Each experiment was at least carried out three times. Receptor-dependent stimulation of MAP kinase can be transient (i.e. a monophasic activation that fades after a few minutes) or result in sustained activation. If RAP1 were important for regulation of MAP kinase by the A2A-adenosine receptor, the kinetics of activation should be reasonably similar. To test this prediction, the time course of MAP kinase activation (Fig.1A) and of RAP1 activation (Fig. 1B) was determined in CHO cells that heterologously expressed the human A2A-adenosine receptor (CHO-A2A cells). Addition of the A2A-selective agonist CGS21680 resulted in biphasic stimulation of MAP kinase phosphorylation. An early increment in the phosphorylation of the endogenous p42 and p44 (ERK2 and ERK1) isoforms of MAP kinase was seen at 5–10 min and was followed by a sustained phase of activation after 60–90 min (Fig. 1A). It is evident from Fig. 1B(left panel) that GTP-liganded active RAP1 was also formed with biphasic kinetics. We also verified by co-immunoprecipitation that receptor-dependent activation of RAP1 (by CGS21680 or by thrombin as a positive control) resulted in formation of a complex between of RAP1 with its putative effector B-RAF (Fig. 1B, right panel). RAP1 is under the control of cAMP-dependent exchange factors (7de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 8Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Thus, protein kinase A should be dispensable for both activation of RAP1 and stimulation of MAP kinase. This was clearly not the case. Formation of GTP-bound RAP1 was insensitive to the PKA-inhibitor H89 (Fig. 1C, lower panel); in contrast, activation of MAP kinase was suppressed by H89 (Fig.1C, upper panel). In order to directly activate cAMP-dependent effectors, we also performed a similar set of experiments with the membrane-permeable cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP; the results were equivalent to those shown in Fig. 1, A—C, for the A2A-agonist CGS21680 (data not shown). The time course of RAP1 activation and the kinetics of MAP kinase phosphorylation were compatible with a cause and effect relationship. Similarly, the fact that following stimulation by an A2A-agonist, RAP1 associated with B-RAF, which is a MAP kinase kinase kinase and thus, by definition, upstream of ERK1/2. These observations clearly argued for a role of RAP1 in mediating the stimulatory effect of the A2A-receptor on MAP kinase. However, the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 discriminated between stimulation of MAP kinase phosphorylation and GTP loading of RAP1. This indicated a requirement for protein kinase A rather than for an exchange factor of the Epac family. It has been argued that protein kinase A acted upstream of RAP1 activation, possibly on the RAP1 exchange factor C3G (16Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In order to address this discrepancy, we employed RAP1GAP, a member of the GAP family that regulates RAP1 (17Polakis P. Rubinfeld B. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10780-10785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intrinsic GTPase activity of small G proteins is very low, and it is, in most cases, accelerated by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that provides one or more residues required for catalysis. Thus, GAPs switch off the active, GTP-bound state. We transiently expressed an HA-tagged version of RAP1GAP together with epitope versions of reporter RAP1 (Fig.2A) and ERK1 (Fig.2B). Overexpression of HA-tagged RAP1GAP efficiently prevented the accumulation of GTP-bound RAP1 after stimulation of CHO-A2A cells by the A2A-agonist (Fig.2A, top row). Cells that expressed HA-RAP1GAP (middle row in Fig.2A) synthesized less HA-RAP1 (Fig. 2A, bottom row). However, GTP-bound RAP1 was below the detection limit, even if HA-RAP1GAP-transfected cells had been stimulated by the A2A-agonist. In contrast, GTP-loaded RAP1A was detected under basal conditions in vector-transfected control cells; it is evident from a comparison of the level of total (bottom rowin Fig. 2A) and GTP-bound RAP1 (top row, Fig.2A) that the lower level of reporter HA-RAP1 in HA-RAP1GAP-transfected cells clearly still would have sufficed to allow for the detection of receptor-dependent activation. Although the accumulation of GTP-bound RAP1 was completely abrogated by the overexpression of RAP1GAP, it did not have any appreciable effect on the phosphorylation of a co-transfected reporter MAP kinase in response to stimulation by CGS21680 (Fig. 2B, cf. lanes C in vector and HA-RAP1GAP-transfected cells). Similar observations were also made if cells were stimulated with the membrane-permeable cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 2B, lanes labeled8Br). These results were difficult to reconcile with published data, namely that RAP1GAP attenuated MAP kinase activation by the β2-adrenergic receptor (16Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We therefore also transiently co-expressed the β2-adrenergic receptor in CHO-A2A cells together with the reporter MAP kinase in the absence and presence of HA-RAP1-GAP. By contrast with MAP kinase stimulation with the A2A-agonist (and 8-Br-cAMP), RAP1GAP did diminish isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylation of the reporter MAP kinase construct (Fig. 2C, cf. lanes labeledI and C for isoproterenol and CGS21680, respectively). Finally, we ruled out that any differences observed are due to a variation in the amount of reporter MAP kinase in the immunoprecipitates because comparable levels were detected with an antiserum that recognizes holo-ERK1/2 (bottom rows in Fig.2, B and C). Activation of MAP kinase by β2-adrenoceptors is dependent on receptor internalization (18Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In order to test if this was also true for the A2A-receptor, CHO-A2A cells were transiently co-transfected with dynamin K44A, a dominant negative suppressor of dynamin-dependent formation of endocytotic vesicles (19Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), the reporter MAP kinase, and the β2-adrenergic receptor. As a control, we employed the plasmid encoding wild type dynamin (which did not alter the response to the agonists CGS21680 and isoproterenol, not shown). Fig.3A shows that the response to the β2-agonist isoproterenol was blunted in cells that expressed dynamin K44A; in contrast, dynamin K44A did not have any appreciable effect on the stimulation of reporter MAP kinase by the A2A-adenosine receptor (Fig. 3A, lanes C). Two additional manipulations highlighted the fundamental difference between activation of ERK1/2 by the β2-adrenergic receptor and A2A-adenosine receptor; neither overexpression of the carboxyl terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase nor of phosducin, which both act as scavengers for free βγ, impaired A2A-receptor-stimulated MAP kinase activation (data not shown). In contrast, receptor-generated Gβγ is important for MAP kinase activation by the β2-adrenergic receptor (20Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Taken together the observations indicated that there was a fundamental difference in the mechanism by which the A2A-adenosine receptor and the β2-adrenergic receptor impinged on MAP kinase. We have therefore explored if the A2A-adenosine receptor signaled to MAP kinase via transactivation. Originally, receptors with tyrosine kinase activity were proposed to act as scaffolds for the assembly of signaling complexes and to thereby support MAP kinase activation by G protein-coupled receptors, and this was referred to as transactivation; more recently, the emphasis has shifted to the ability of G protein-coupled receptors to promote the release of cell surface-bound growth factors, e.g.heparin-binding EGF, via activation of a matrix metalloprotease (11Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). By definition, this type of stimulation is paracrine stimulation; we have therefore used a co-culture system that was analogous to the one originally employed by Prenzel et al. (11; see also ref.21Pierce K.L. Tohgo A. Ahn S. Field M.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23155-23160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); CHO-A2A or control CHO cells were mixed at 1:1 ratio with reporter CHO cells that harbored an epitope-tagged MAP kinase and seeded at high density. Growth factor release and the ensuing paracrine stimulation ought to be detected as A2A-receptor-dependent stimulation of MAP kinase in the reporter cells. This was clearly not observed; on the contrary, the reporter MAP kinase was phosphorylated to a negligible extent irrespective of whether the co-culture contained cells endowed with or lacking the A2A-adenosine receptor (Fig.3B, top row). In contrast, we readily detected the phosphorylation of endogenous MAP kinase isoforms in the cellular lysates if these were prepared from co-cultures containing CHO-A2A cells; as expected, MAP kinase was irresponsive to the A2A-agonist in the control co-cultures that lacked A2A-receptor-bearing cells (Fig. 3B, bottom row). We therefore conclude that the A2A-adenosine receptor relies on components that are intrinsically present within the stimulated cell to activate MAP kinase and that there is no evidence for the involvement of an additional, extracellular signal. The observations presented so far suggested that cAMP-dependent activation of PKA played an essential role in linking MAP kinase to the A2A-adenosine receptor. However, Gαs may have effectors other than adenylyl cyclase isoforms; the non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC has, in particular, been reported as direct target of Gαs (9Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). If the signaling pathway A2A-adenosine receptor/Gs/SRC was upstream of MAP kinase activation, inhibition of SRC (or related kinases) ought to discriminate between receptor- and cAMP-dependent MAP kinase stimulation. We therefore tested incubated CHO-A2A cell in the presence of 1 μm PP1, an inhibitor of SRC family kinases. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, preincubation with PP1 specifically abrogated the ability of the A2A-agonist CGS21680 (lanes C) and of forskolin (lanes F) to stimulate MAP kinase phosphorylation. In control, PP1 did not blunt the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (lanes FGF in"

GalNAc-4-ST1 and GalNAc-4-ST2 both transfer sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc on N-linked oligosaccharides such as those found on the glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin (10Manzella S.M.

Like C4ST-1, this new sulfotransferase, chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase-3 (C4ST-3) transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of β1,4-linked GalNAc that is flanked by GlcUA residues in chondroitin. In contrast to C4ST-1, C4ST-3 is labile at 37 °C and has a restricted distribution, suggesting that it may have a unique biological role in vivo.DISCUSSIONC4ST-3 represents the seventh member of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases. C4ST-3 has the highest percentage of identical amino acids when aligned with C4ST-1, 45.1% identical. Like C4ST-1, C4ST-3 transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of GalNAc substituted at C-3 with β-linked GlcUA (i.e. GlcUAβ,3-GalNAc). Neither sulfotransferase transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of GalNAc substituted at C-3 with α-linked IdoUA (i.e. dermatan) or to terminal GalNAc in the sequence GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Man found at the terminus of certain N-linked oligosaccharides. Based on the levels of mRNA expression, C4ST-1 is widely expressed in tissues (8Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Since C4ST-3 and C4ST-1 have similar, if not identical, specificities and are both expressed in liver, kidney, and lymph nodes, the biological role played by C4ST-3 is not clear. The lability of C4ST-3 at 37 °C as compared with C4ST-1 and the lower levels of expression seen following transfection as compared with C4ST-1 suggest that C4ST-3 may have a different and perhaps highly specialized role in vivo.With the exception of HNK-1 ST itself, the seven members of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases have all proved to be GalNAc-4-O-sulfotransferases.

Since the functions of these proteoglycans are modulated and/or require the addition of sulfate, the existence of multiple chondroitin-4-GalNAc sulfotransferases provides the potential for additional regulation and specificity.

Like C4ST-1, this new sulfotransferase, chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase-3 (C4ST-3) transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of β1,4-linked GalNAc that is flanked by GlcUA residues in chondroitin. In contrast to C4ST-1, C4ST-3 is labile at 37 °C and has a restricted distribution, suggesting that it may have a unique biological role in vivo. DISCUSSIONC4ST-3 represents the seventh member of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases. C4ST-3 has the highest percentage of identical amino acids when aligned with C4ST-1, 45.1% identical. Like C4ST-1, C4ST-3 transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of GalNAc substituted at C-3 with β-linked GlcUA (i.e. GlcUAβ,3-GalNAc). Neither sulfotransferase transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of GalNAc substituted at C-3 with α-linked IdoUA (i.e. dermatan) or to terminal GalNAc in the sequence GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Man found at the terminus of certain N-linked oligosaccharides.

The lability of C4ST-3 at 37 °C as compared with C4ST-1 and the lower levels of expression seen following transfection as compared with C4ST-1 suggest that C4ST-3 may have a different and perhaps highly specialized role in vivo.With the exception of HNK-1 ST itself, the seven members of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases have all proved to be GalNAc-4-O-sulfotransferases.

Elevated expression of p58PITSLRE in eukaryotic cells prevents them from undergoing normal cytokinesis and appears to delay them in late telophase. To investigate the molecular mechanism of p58PITSLRE action, we used the yeast two-hybrid system, screened a human fetal liver cDNA library, and identified cyclin D3 as an interacting partner of p58PITSLRE. In vitro binding assay, in vivo coimmunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence cell staining further confirmed the association of p58PITSLRE with cyclin D3. This binding was observed only in the G2/M phase but not in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle; meanwhile, no interaction between p110PITSLRE and cyclin D3 was observed in all the cell cycle. The overexpression of cyclin D3 in 7721 cells leads to an exclusively accumulation of p58PITSLRE in the nuclear region, affecting its cellular distribution. Histone H1 kinase activity of p58PITSLRE was greatly enhanced upon interaction with cyclin D3.

The eukaryotic cell division cycle is tightly regulated by the activation and deactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; 7721/p58 cells, the 7721 cells ectopically expressed of p58PITSLRE; HA, influenza hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody epitope; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. Active CDK serves as a protein kinase subunit, the kinase activity of which is dependent on its association with a regulatory cyclin subunit (1Pines J. Trends Biochem.

In mammalian cells both the CDKs and cyclins consist of numerous members, including cyclin A-H and at least nine different p34cdc2-related kinases (4Grana X. Reddy E.P.

Among them, the CDKs 4 and 6 are first activated by binding to the D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, and D3) and are believed to control progression through G1 phase of the cell cycle, in response to cell cycle progression and mitogenic signals (3Sherr C.J.

The p34cdc2 (CDK1) in association with cyclin A is essential for the completion of S phase and entry into G2 phase, whereas the transition through G2/M phase is regulated by p34cdc2-cyclin B complex (12King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Therefore, the association of different CDK subunits with different cyclin subunits regulates progression through different stages of the cell cycle (1Pines J. Trends Biochem.

Although cyclin binding is required for the activation of the CDK subunit of the complex, other means of modulating the activity of CDKs also exist, such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the key residues on the CDK subunit and the binding of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (2Elledge S.J.

The PITSLRE homologues exist in human, mouse, chicken,Drosophila, and Xenopus, suggesting that their functions may be well conserved (16Bunnell B.A. Heath L.S. Adams D.E. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Proc.

The small p58PITSLRE isoform was originally isolated from a human liver cDNA library and has a 299-amino acid region with 68% homology to the p34cdc2 protein kinase (16Bunnell B.A. Heath L.S. Adams D.E. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7467-7471Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). During the study of p58PITSLRE, 10 isoforms of the p58PITSLRE subfamily of protein kinases including p110PITSLRE have been isolated by molecular cloning (19Xiang J.L. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of multiple p58PITSLRE isoforms has led to the renaming of these kinases according to an established nomenclature system, which is based on the single amino acid codon designation of the conserved PSTAIRE box region of p34cdc2 (17Meyerson M. Enders G.H., Wu, C.L., Su, L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.-H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The p110PITSLRE isoform can be detected in all phases of the cell cycle, whereas the p58PITSLRE is mainly expressed in G2/M phase (28Cornelis S. Bruynooghe Y. Denecker G. Huffel S.V. Tinton S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of p58PITSLRE in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts leads to a late telophase delay, abnormal cytokinesis, and a reduced rate of cell growth (16Bunnell B.A. Heath L.S. Adams D.E. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7467-7471Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Conversely, the diminished expression of p58PITSLRE mRNA is found to increase DNA replication and enhance cell growth (17Meyerson M. Enders G.H., Wu, C.L., Su, L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.-H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the Chinese hamster ovary cells ectopically expressed of p58PITSLREdemonstrated that the reduced cell growth was due to apoptosis (20Lahti J.M. Xiang J.L. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that the p58PITSLRE and p110PITSLRE isoforms were cleaved by caspase proteases to generate smaller 46–50-kDa proteins that could also phosphorylate histone H1 during tumor necrosis factor α- and Fas-mediated apoptosis (21Beyaert B. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol.

Because of its ultimate function in cell growth control, the p58PITSLRE and its family have been a target for alteration, translocation, and deletion during tumorigenesis (18Lahti J.M. Valentine M.

Although the p58PITSLRE plays an important role in cell cycle progression, little is known about its interaction proteins. Meanwhile, study of the p110PITSLRE isoform showed that it could interact with the RNA-binding protein RNPS1, RNA polymerase II, and multiple transcriptional elongation factors, regulating some aspects of RNA splicing or transcription in proliferating cells (29Loyer P. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Trembley J.H., Hu, D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of the cellular proteins that interact with p58PITSLRE is a useful approach for defining the cellular function and regulatory mechanism of p58PITSLRE. To investigate this issue, a two-hybrid screening from human fetal liver cDNA library was carried out using the full length of p58PITSLRE as bait. As a result, cyclin D3 was identified as a p58PITSLRE-associated protein. This interaction between p58PITSLRE and cyclin D3 is specific, as demonstrated by the inability of the other D-type cyclins to associate with p58PITSLRE using in vitro binding assays and yeast two-hybrid assays and the inability of the p110PITSLRE to associate with cyclin D3 using immunofluorescence cell staining and immunoprecipitation. More importantly, we showed that the p58PITSLRE was associated with the cyclin D3 in vivo at G2/M phase by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Interestingly, the elevated expression of cyclin D3 affected p58PITSLREcellular distribution. Moreover, kinase activity of p58PITSLRE was greatly enhanced upon cyclin D3 association. Taken together, the data suggest that cyclin D3 is important for some aspects of p58PITSLRE regulation and function in G2/M phase. 7721 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, were obtained from the Institute of Cell Biology, Academic Sinica. The 7721 cells ectopically expressed of p58PITSLRE(7721/p58 cells) were constructed and confirmed in our previous work (31Zhang S.W., Xu, S.L. Cai M.M. Zhu X.Y. Yan J., Hu, Y. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 221: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal anti-PITSLRE antibody, the goat anti-rabbit-fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody, and the goat anti-mouse-rhodamine secondary antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin D3 antibody was purchased from Signal Transduction Laboratories. Protein G-agarose, glutathione-Sepharose beads, the mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibody, and histone H1 were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Bovine β-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1, leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (>3000 Ci/mm), [35S]methionine, Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody, and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay kit were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. A genetic screen using the yeast interaction trap was performed as recommended by the manufacturers (according to CLONTECH Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid system user manual). The full-length of p58PITSLRE was cloned in-frame into LexA-coding sequence to generate bait plasmid, pLexA-p58PITSLRE. A human fetal liver cDNA library in the pB42AD plasmid (CLONTECH) was screened for proteins that interact with p58PITSLRE using EGY48 yeast strain (Matα trp1 ura3–52 leu2::pLeu2-lexAop6(ΔG-UAS leu2)). Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method. Plasmid DNA from LEU2+/LacZ+ colonies was isolated and recovered, and the true positives were sequenced with dideoxy sequencing according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The fish plasmid, pB42AD harboring cyclin D3, was transformed back into yeast along with either the bait plasmid or other nonspecific bait plasmids to verify the specificity of the two-hybrid assay. For direct interaction tests, pLexA constructs with the full-length of p58PITSLRE and the two mutants, were co-transformed with the D-type cyclin pB42AD constructs. The specific interaction was measured by the production of leucine and β-galactosidase. For the bait of two-hybrid system, the full-length of p58PITSLRE (31Zhang S.W., Xu, S.L. Cai M.M. Zhu X.Y. Yan J., Hu, Y. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 221: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was cloned into theEcoRI/XhoI site of pLexA (CLONTECH) in-frame with the DNA binding domain of LexA. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion expression vector pcDNA3-GST-p58PITSLRE and pcDNA3-GST-CDK4 for in vitro translation and the HA epitope-tagged p58PITSLRE eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3-HA-p58PITSLRE were obtained as described previously (31Zhang S.W., Xu, S.L. Cai M.M. Zhu X.Y. Yan J., Hu, Y. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 221: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To generate pEGFP-p58PITSLRE, the full-length of p58PITSLRE without the stop codon was cloned into pEGFP N3 in-frame with the EGFP. The deletion mutants of p58PITSLRE were constructed by PCR with pLexA-p58PITSLRE as the template using the primers NH2-p58PITSLRE (sense, an EcoRI site for subsequent subcloning is underlined; 5′-gcgaattcgaggaagaaatgagtgaaga-3′), NH2-p58PITSLRE (antisense, an XhoI site for subsequent subcloning is underlined; 5′-gcctcgagcttttgctctgtagaccactc-3′), ΔNH2-p58PITSLRE (sense, an EcoRI site is underlined; 5′-gcgaattctgccggagcgtcgaggagtt-3′), and ΔNH2-p58PITSLRE (antisense, aSalI site is underlined; 5′-gggtcgacacaaagtaagacgaggagtt-3′). Full-length cyclin D3, obtained from yeast two-hybrid screening, was cloned into pcDNA3 for in vitro translation. By PCR amplification, we cloned cyclin D3 in-frame into pDsRed C1 at the site ofEcoRI/BamHI using the primers cyclin D3 (sense, an EcoRI site is underlined; 5′-Gcgaattctatggagctgctgtgttgcga-3′) and cyclin D3 (antisense, a BamHI site is underlined; 5′-gcggatccagagggcctctccagggcta-3′). The cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 cDNAs were also generated by PCR with the human liver cDNA library cDNA (Invitrogen) as template using the primers cyclin D1 (sense, an EcoRI site is underlined; 5′-gcgaattcatggaacaccagctcctgtg-3′), cyclin D1 (antisense, an XhoI site is underlined; 5′-gcctcgagtcagatgtccacgtcccgca-3′), cyclin D2 (sense, anEcoRI site is underlined; 5′-gcgaattcatggagctgctgtgccacga-3′), and cyclin D2 (antisense, an XhoI site is underlined; 5′-gcctcgaggcccaactggcatcctcaca-3′. All the plasmids produced by PCR were confirmed by sequencing. GST-p58PITSLRE, GST-CDK4, GST, cyclin D1, cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 were [35S]methionine-labeledin vitro with the TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the user manual. Plasmid DNA purified with Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega) was added to the TNT® lysate reaction buffer with 0.4 μCi/μl [35S]methionine. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, the labeled proteins were mixed together with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in the binding buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) for 4 h at 4 °C. Then the beads were washed three times with the binding buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by autoradiography after they were resolved by SDS-PAGE. All the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in humidified air. G1/S phase-arrested 7721 cells were obtained by sequential thymidine treatment. First, the cells were treated with 2.5 mmthymidine for 24 h then changed to the fresh medium for another 24 h and replaced with the 2.5 mm thymidine medium for 24 h. To block cells in G2/M phase, cells were seeded in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.5 mmthymidine. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fed with medium containing camptothecin (0.5 μm). One hour later, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fed with complete medium for additional 23.5 h. The 7721 cells grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum were plated in 60-mm dishes (Nunc) at a concentration of 6 × 105 cells/dish the day before transfection. Plasmid DNA (4 μg) was transfected into 7721 cells with a calcium phosphate precipitation method. Two days after transfection, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm benzamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Detergent-insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The whole cell lysates were incubated with mouse normal IgG or anti-HA monoclonal antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. Pre-equilibrated protein G-agarose beads were then added, and after 4 h of incubation, they were collected by centrifugation and then gently washed three times with the lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with a 1:1000 dilution of a monoclonal anti-cyclin D3 antibody. Proteins were detected using the ECL kit. The coimmunoprecipitation in 7721 cells under normal physiological situations was conducted with the normal 7721 cells and the 7721 cells synchronized at a different cell cycle phase. The method was the same as above except that the antibody used for immunoprecipitation was monoclonal anti-cyclin D3 antibody and for immunoblot was rabbit polyclonal anti-PITSLRE antibody. The coimmunoprecipitation for the HeLa cells was the same as that of the 7721 cells. Cellular fractionation was performed as below. G2/M phase-arrested cells (8 × 106) were suspended for 5 min on ice in 500 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1× complete protease inhibitors, 0.3% Nonidet P-40). After gentle mixing, the lysate fraction was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants constituted the cytoplasmic fractions with the pellets representing the nuclear fractions. Coimmunoprecipitation was performed with anti-cyclin D3 monoclonal antibody, and immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-PITSLRE antibody (29Loyer P. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p58PITSLRE protein kinase activity was measured by immunoprecipitation of 200 μg of whole 7721/p58 cell protein extracts using either the anti-HA antibody to precipitate the exogenously expressed and tagged p58PITSLRE kinase molecules or the rabbit polyclonal anti-PITSLRE antibody to precipitate all the p58PITSLRE kinase molecules. For immunodepletion of cyclin D3, the 200-μg whole 7721/p58 cell protein extracts were first immunodepleted of cyclin D3 with the monoclonal anti-cyclin D3 antibody and then used for p58PITSLRE precipitation. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed for histone H1 kinase activity using H1 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μmATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.25 μg/μl histone H1) and, for β-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 kinase activity, using buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μmATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.25 μg/μl β-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1). Histone H1 phosphorylation was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Quantitation of histone H1 phosphorylation by p58PITSLRE kinase was determined by phosphorimaging. β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase 1 phosphorylation was analyzed by 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the reaction mixture on glass fiber filters followed by liquid scintillation counting (16Bunnell B.A. Heath L.S.

For checking the efficiency of the immunodepletion, the precipitates were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and immunoblotted with an anti-cyclin D3 antibody. The 7721 cells were plated onto coverslips the day before synchronization. After synchronization, they were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 1 h and blocked in PBS containing 10% normal blocking serum followed by an overnight reaction with the primary antibody at 4 °C. The primary antibody consisted of monoclonal anti-cyclin D3 antibody and the rabbit polyclonal anti-PITSLRE antibody. After overnight incubation, the coverslips were rinsed 3 times in PBS and reacted for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate and goat anti-rabbit IgG-R (from Santa Cruz) in the dark. The coverslips were washed as described above, inverted, mounted on slides, and sealed with nail polish. The coverslips were examined in a Leica confocal microscope. Digitized images of the fluorescent-antibody-stained cells were acquired with software provided by Leica. The 7721 cells were plated onto coverslips the day before transfection. The pEGFP-p58PITSLRE and pDsRed-cyclin D3 or pEGFP-p58PITSLRE with pDsRed C1 were transiently co-transfected into 7721 cells with LipofectAMINE-PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the transfected cells were fixed for 30 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS and observed under the Leica confocal microscope as described above. To identify proteins that interact with p58PITSLRE, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed with p58PITSLRE-fused LexA DNA binding domain as bait. The bait did not have any intrinsic activity of transcriptional activation for the two reporters. A human fetal liver cDNA library was screened as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Approximately 6 × 106 independent transformants were pooled and spread on the selection media (Ura−, His−, Trp−, and Leu−) containing 2% galactose to induce the expression of library cDNA. In the selection media, 50 colonies showed LEU2+/LacZ+. The plasmids were extracted by yeast miniprep for further study. False positive clones were eliminated with the following approach. The positive library plasmids were reintroduced into the yeast alone or with (a) pLexA, (b) pLexA-p58PITSLRE, or (c) pLexA hybrid with an unrelated protein. Only the transformants that co-transformed the library plasmid with pLexA-p58PITSLREwere positive for β-galactosidase activity, indicating true positive interactions. Among the first 50 LEU2+/LacZ+colonies, there were 19 true positive colonies. The cDNAs from the 19 true positive colonies were PCR-amplified with primers derived from the vector pB42AD followed by sequence determination. DNA sequencing and data base searching revealed that the nucleotide sequence of 5 clones encoded full-length of human cyclin D3. The other 14 clones are in progress in our lab. To further confirm the interaction between p58PITSLRE and cyclin D3, two cloning vectors were exchanged by moving cyclin D3 from the activation domain (pB42AD) to the DNA-BD vector (pLexA) and p58PITSLRE from the pLexA to pB42AD. The repeated two-hybrid assay was also positive for the two reporters (data not shown). The fact that cyclin D3 was identified by two-hybrid screening using p58PITSLRE as bait raised the question of whether p58PITSLRE interacted preferentially with this D-type cyclin or it also interacted with the other two D-type cyclins. To answer this question, we used a direct two-hybrid experiment to compare cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 for their ability to bind to p58PITSLRE. As a positive control, cyclin D3 was included in this experiment. As the negative control, p58PITSLRE alone did not permit growth of the yeast on nutrient-deficient medium. Subsequent transformation with either of the D-type cyclin constructs showed that neither of the other two D-type cyclins permitted activation of the reporter genes, whereas cyclin D3, in the presence of p58PITSLRE, did activate the two report genes (data not shown). These data indicated that only cyclin D3 but not cyclin D1 or cyclin D2 interacted with p58PITSLRE in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig 1). The ability of D-type cyclins to interact with p58PITSLRE was further tested using a GST pull-down experiment. The GST-p58PITSLRE, GST-CDK4, GST, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 were synthesized and isotopically labele"
https://openalex.org/W2167082076,"The fission yeast stress-activated Sty1/Spc1 MAPK pathway responds to a similar range of stresses as do the mammalian p38 and SAPK/JNK MAPK pathways. In addition, sty1(-) cells are sterile and exhibit a G(2) cell cycle delay, indicating additional roles of Sty1 in meiosis and cell cycle progression. To identify novel proteins involved in stress responses, a microarray analysis of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome was performed to find genes that are up-regulated following exposure to stress in a Sty1-dependent manner. One such gene identified, srk1(+) (Sty1-regulated kinase 1), encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase homologous to mammalian calmodulin kinases. At the C terminus of Srk1 is a putative MAPK binding motif similar to that in the p38 substrates, MAPK-activated protein kinases 2 and 3. Indeed, we find that Srk1 is present in a complex with the Sty1 MAPK and is directly phosphorylated by Sty1. Furthermore, upon stress, Srk1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a process that is dependent on the Sty1 MAPK. Finally, we show that Srk1 has a role in regulating meiosis in fission yeast; following nitrogen limitation, srk1(-) cells enter meiosis significantly faster than wild-type cells and overexpression of srk1(+) inhibits the nitrogen starvation-induced arrest in G(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2039539436,"Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors are involved in several physiological processes, including the regulation of apoptosis. These factors were shown to exhibit pro- or anti-apoptotic activities in different cellular models, but at present, the mechanisms underlying these opposite effects are poorly understood. In this study, we show that the constitutive expression of a transcriptionally active member of the Rel/NF-kappaB family, c-Rel, first induces a resistance against TNFalpha-induced apoptosis and later increases the level of spontaneous apoptosis of HeLa cells. Both the anti- and pro-apoptotic effects increase with the level of c-Rel overexpression. The up-regulation by c-Rel of the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) could explain both the rapid anti-apoptotic effect and the delayed pro-apoptotic one. Indeed, the enzymatic activity of MnSOD is to transform the toxic O(2)(*)(-) in H(2)O(2). Hence, on one hand, its induction helps cells to resist against the apoptogenic burst of O(2)(*)(-) produced upon TNFalpha stimulation, but on the other hand, it leads to a progressive H(2)O(2) accumulation that ultimately results in apoptosis. These results indicate that the anti- and pro-apoptotic effects of Rel/NF-kappaB factors are not necessarily alternative but can occur successively in the same cell, via the up-regulation of the same target gene."
https://openalex.org/W2064458544,"Transcriptional regulation of the fospromoter by nitric oxide and cGMP can occur by nuclear translocation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (G-kinase I) (Gudi, T., Lohmann, S. M., and Pilz, R. B. (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. 17, 5244–5254). To identify nuclear targets of G-kinase I, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with G-kinase Iβ as bait. We found that G-kinase Iβ interacted specifically with TFII-I, an unusual transcriptional regulator that associates with multiple proteins to modulate both basal and signal-induced transcription. By using purified recombinant proteins, the interaction was mapped to the N-terminal 93 amino acids of G-kinase Iβ and one of six 95-amino acid repeats found in TFII-I. In baby hamster kidney cells, cGMP analogs enhanced co-immunoprecipitation of G-kinase Iβ and TFII-I by inducing co-localization of both proteins in the nucleus, but in other cell types containing cytoplasmic TFII-I the G-kinase-TFII-I interaction was largely cGMP-independent. G-kinase phosphorylated TFII-I in vitro and in vivo on Ser371 and Ser743 outside of the interaction domain. G-kinase strongly enhanced TFII-I transactivation of a serum-response element-containing promoter in COS7 cells, and this effect was lost when Ser371 and Ser743 of TFII-I were mutated. TFII-I by itself had little effect on a full-length fospromoter in baby hamster kidney cells, but it synergistically enhanced transcriptional activation by G-kinase Iβ. Binding of G-kinase to TFII-I may position the kinase to phosphorylate and regulate TFII-I and/or factors that interact with TFII-I at the serum-response element.

Nature. 1993; 365: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the human and murine fos promoter, TFII-I binds to two conserved sites in a sequence-specific manner as follows: one site overlaps with the STAT-binding site at the sis-inducible element, and the other overlaps with the SRF-binding site at the serum-response element (SRE) (4Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to sharing overlapping DNA recognition sites on the fos promoter, TFII-I also binds to STAT-1 and SRF proteins directly and stabilizes and stimulates the transactivation activity of ternary complexes of SRF and Phox-1 (3Grueneberg D.A.

When co-transfected with fos promoter constructs, TFII-I has little or no transactivating potential by itself, but it enhances fospromoter activation by growth factors and phorbol esters about 2-fold (4Kim D.-W.

In B-lymphocytes, TFII-I is tightly associated with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) via the pleckstrin homology domain of BTK; after B-cell receptor engagement, TFII-I is tyrosine-phosphorylated by BTK leading to dissociation of the proteins, enhanced nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of TFII-I (13Yang W.

Serum stimulation of other cell types induces TFII-I phosphorylation on Tyr248 by JAK2; this phosphorylation is required for the association of TFII-I with and phosphorylation by the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase that regulates TFII-I transcriptional activity on the fos promoter (11Kim D.-W.

The nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase) signal transduction pathway has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (23Eigenthaler M.

There are two major types of G-kinase, a soluble type I and a membrane-bound type II; type I G-kinase is widely expressed and present in smooth muscle and endothelial and neuronal cells, whereas type II G-kinase is more limited in expression (26Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of G-kinase I (Iα and Iβ) are produced by alternative splicing from a single gene and differ only in their extreme N terminus (amino acids 1–89 and 1–104, respectively), which encode a dimerization and autoinhibitory domain with 36% amino acid identity (24Hofmann F.

Mice with a homozygous null mutation in the G-kinase I gene demonstrate loss of NO/cGMP-dependent smooth muscle relaxation leading to severe vascular and intestinal dysfunction with death at a young age (27Pfeifer A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). G-kinase I additionally regulates myocardial contractility, platelet aggregation, endothelial cell permeability, neuronal cell survival, and synaptic plasticity (23Eigenthaler M. Lohmann S.M.

Some downstream targets of G-kinase I were identified using classic biochemical approaches, as in the case of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-associated G-kinase substrate, IRAG (28Schlossmann J.

To search for other potential nuclear targets of G-kinase I, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length G-kinase Iβ as the bait.

Full-length TFII-I was also subcloned into pGEX-2T, and C-terminal deletions of TFII-I were prepared by digestion with SmaI (amino acid 869), SpeI and SmaI (amino acid 606), orEcoRI (amino acid 363); the vector with the N-terminal TFII-I fragments was purified, blunted if necessary, and re-ligated. The cDNA library clone encoding R4 of TFII-I was subcloned into pGEX-KGL using NotI. Full-length TFII-I with an N-terminal polyhistidine (His) tag and a C-terminal Myc tag was constructed in the bacterial expression vector pRSET-B (Novagen). The plasmids pGL2(−225 + 268) encoding the luciferase reporter gene under control of the human KDR/flk1 promoter and pGL2(Inr-Mut) containing the same promoter with a mutated Inr sequence were from C. Pattersen (see Ref. 54Wu Y. Patterson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid pSRE-Luc was provided by U. Moens (University of Tromsoe, Norway); it contains a single copy of the fos SRE upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase reporter gene, and it was used because reporters with multiple SRE copies were not efficiently transactivated by co-transfected TFII-I. 2D. Casteel and R.B. Pilz, unpublished observations. Moreover, pSRE-CAT used in a previous study (41Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol.

Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 225: 331-342Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Expression of G-kinase from the bait vector was tested by Western blotting using a G-kinase I-specific antibody and by secondary transformation using G-kinase Iβ in the vector pVP16; the latter transformation yielded yeast colonies growing on His-deficient media and producing β-galactosidase activity, whereas expression of the G-kinase bait vector by itself or together with pVP16 empty vector did not. For library screening, the yeast strain L40 previously transformed with pBTM116-GKIβ was re-transformed with a 9.5–10.5 days post-coitum random-primed mouse embryo cDNA library in pVP16 (provided by A. Hollenberg (see Ref. 56Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 225: 331-342Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar)); double transformants were selected on synthetic media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Yeast colonies were transferred onto 3MM Whatman paper and processed for a β-galactosidase filter assay (56Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 225: 331-342Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive colonies and re-transformed into yeast strain L40 either alone, with pBTM116-GKIβ, or with pBTM116-laminin which served as a control for nonspecific “sticky” proteins. The cDNA inserts from clones that produced a positive signal only when co-transformed with the pBTM116-GKIβ bait vector were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method, and sequences were analyzed using BLAST (57Altschul S.F.

The GST-tagged TFII-I fragments were expressed from pGEX-based vectors in the bacterial strain DH-5α, whereas TFII-I in pRSET was grown in the strain BL21; overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 in fresh media, grown to mid-log phase for ∼1 h, and incubated with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for an additional 3 h of shaking at 37 °C. The GST-tagged proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the His-tagged TFII-I was purified using nickel chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer of the affinity matrices (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of protein on the beads was quantitated by comparison to bovine serum albumin (BSA) using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. GST-tagged G-kinase fragments were produced in COS7 cells using the mammalian expression vector pCMV-GST (52Tsai R.Y.L. Reed R.R. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and full-length EE-tagged G-kinase Iβ was produced in baculovirus-infected SF9 insect cells (58Pöhler D. Butt E.

Approximately 1 μg of GST or GST-TFII-I bound to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of EE-tagged full-length G-kinase Iβ in 50 μl of binding buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% BSA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptide, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The beads were washed four times in buffer A; bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-EE antibody (hybridoma supernatant at 1:500 dilution) (59Grussenmeyer T.

Similarly, GST or GST-G-kinase fractions isolated from ∼1 × 106 COS7 cells bound to glutathione beads were incubated with 1 μg of His- and Myc-tagged TFII-I purified from bacteria and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000 dilution). All Western blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence as described (41Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B.

Baby hamster kidney (BHK) and COS7 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and were transfected with LipofectAMINETM (Life Sciences) or PolyfectTM (Qiagen) as described before (41Gudi T.

Murine myoblast C2C12 cells (from the ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. To examine TFII-I distribution between nuclear and extranuclear compartments, cells were lysed, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (60Andrews N.C. Faller D.V.

A degradation channel that can tolerate some steric bulk may reconcile the two opposing needs for degradation that is compartmentalized to avoid aberrant proteolysis yet able to handle a range of substrates of various sizes. Protein degradation is a critical part of cellular regulation (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, a multicomponent protease called the proteasome is responsible for the turnover of short-lived regulatory proteins, the removal of abnormal polypeptides, and the production of peptides for antigen presentation (2Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Degradation of short-lived regulatory proteins is essential for a wide range of cellular functions including cell cycle control and signal transduction (3Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Failure to degrade aggregates of misfolded proteins can lead to disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease (4Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Degradation by the proteasome usually involves two consecutive steps: targeting of the substrate for degradation by the attachment of polyubiquitin chains and degradation of the tagged protein by the proteasome with concomitant release of ubiquitin (5Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). The active sites of proteolysis of the proteasome by themselves show little substrate specificity. Specificity of degradation is achieved by sequestering the proteolytic sites within the structure and tightly controlling access. The three-dimensional structure of the proteasome has been determined by x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (6Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R.

Nature. 2000; 408: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The proteasome consists of a central proteolytic core particle with regulatory caps at either end of it. The core particle is made of two copies of seven different α-subunits and seven different β-subunits. The subunits are arranged in four heptameric rings, which are stacked on top of each other to form a cylindrical particle. The rings form a central β-chamber and two α-chambers, one at each end of the particle (2Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The proteolytic sites are located in the β-chamber and are accessible only through a central channel that runs along the long axis of the particle. The channel has narrow constrictions at the entrance and exit of the α-chamber (2Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). In the isolated yeast core particle, the entrance to the degradation channel is blocked by the N termini of the α-subunits (7Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). The channel opens when the regulatory caps bind to the core (12Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The caps consist of 17 subunits, six of which have ATPase activity, and contact the core particle through the ATPase subunits (13Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 14Köhler A. Cascio P. Leggett D.S. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). At its narrowest point, the opened degradation channel is ∼13 Å wide (11Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L. Knowlton J.R. Yao Y. Wang C.C. Hill C.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 12Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). This constriction is too small for folded proteins to fit through it, and substrate proteins must unfold to gain access to the proteolytic sites. Preventing unfolding of a substrate protein protects it from degradation (15Johnston J.A. Johnson E.S. Waller P.R.H. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is now thought that the ATPase subunits in the cap can actively unfold protein substrates (16Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Studies with model proteins with N-terminal ubiquitination sites suggested that the unfolding is induced by the unraveling of the substrate from its N terminus by the proteasome (17Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In model proteins with more than one folded domain, the proteasome first unfolded and degraded the domain at the N terminus adjacent to the ubiquitination site and then the next domain in the protein (17Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Together, these findings conjure an image of the proteasome threading a single polypeptide chain through the degradation channel as it degrades its substrate sequentially. This image is consistent with the small size of the entrance to the degradation channel. The steric constraints of the proteasome degradation channel raise some questions. For example, how are proteins degraded that contain large modification such as O-linked carbohydrates? Can a multidomain protein be degraded from its center so that multiple polypeptide chains are threaded through the degradation channel simultaneously? The ubiquitination sites for a small number of substrates have been defined. For some of them, ubiquitination occurs near the N terminus, as is the case for proteins targeted for degradation by the N-end rule (18Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), for IκBα (19Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), it seems likely that these proteins will be sequentially degraded from their N termini. However, some proteasome substrates are ubiquitinated on internal sites. Examples are NFκB (25Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26Orian A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13886-13893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and Spt23p and Mga2p (30Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S.

Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Are these proteins also degraded from their ends, or can degradation begin from the internal ubiquitination site with the formation of a loop that is fed into the proteasomal degradation channel? This question is particularly pertinent for the activation of the yeast transcription factors Spt23p and Mga2p by the proteasome (30Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar,31Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are anchored to membranes through their C termini. During activation, the proteasome degrades the C-terminal part of the transcription factors to release an N-terminal fragment (30Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 31Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Because the C termini of the transcription factors are blocked by the membrane and the N termini are released intact, degradation must begin from the middle of the precursor proteins. To investigate the steric constraints imposed on substrate proteins by the proteasome structure, we determined whether the degradation channel is flexible enough to allow more than one polypeptide to pass through it at the same time. We constructed a model protein in which specific parts of the polypeptide chain were covalently connected through disulfide bridges. We found that cross-linked model proteins were fully degraded by the proteasome although the presence of two or more disulfide bridges retarded degradation. Therefore, we suggest that the pore of the proteasome permits the concurrent passage of at least three polypeptide chains. Protease substrates were derived from barnase, a ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens(32Hartley R.W. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2367-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 1The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; SDSM, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. fromEscherichia coli (33Rood J.I. Laird A.J. Williams J.W. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 8: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The two proteins were linked in-frame, with barnase at the N terminus followed by DHFR. Ubiquitin and a 40-amino acid linker derived from the E. coli lac repressor were attached to the N terminus of barnase to target the substrate protein to the proteasome by the N-end rule pathway (Fig. 1) (15Johnston J.A. Johnson E.S. Waller P.R.H. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In reticulocyte lysate, the N-terminal ubiquitin is rapidly cleaved, and the remaining protein is ubiquitinated on two lysine residues in the 40-amino acid linker at the N termini of the fusion proteins (35Bachmair A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1989; 56: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Wild-type barnase, the ubiquitin domain, and the targeting linker do not contain cysteine residues. Two cysteine residues in DHFR were mutated to alanine. The changes did not affect the affinity of DHFR toward methotrexate significantly (the dissociation constant is ∼20 nm in the buffer employed for the degradation assay). We introduced three different disulfide bonds into barnase to covalently link neighboring β-strands within the five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet of barnase (36Schwartz M.P. Huang S. Matouschek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The structures of barnase proteins containing these cross-links were determined by x-ray crystallography and found to be almost identical to that of wild-type barnase (37Clarke J. Hendrick K. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We also constructed substrate proteins containing all combinations of two and three disulfide bridges. The genes for the various proteasome substrates were assembled using standard molecular biology techniques in pGEM-3Zf(+) vectors (Promega Corp.), and the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Radioactive proteins were expressed from a T7 promoter by in vitrotranscription and translation in E. coli S30 extract supplemented with [35S]methionine. Neighboring cysteine residues were induced to form disulfide bridges by oxidation with 10 mm ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) for 10 min at room temperature. Under these conditions disulfide bridge formation is complete, and no unreacted cysteine residues could be detected by modification with the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (SDSM) followed by SDS-PAGE (36Schwartz M.P. Huang S. Matouschek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The proteins were partially purified by high speed centrifugation before cross-linking and by ammonium sulfate precipitation after cross-linking as described previously (36Schwartz M.P. Huang S. Matouschek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Degradation by the proteasome was assayed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate essentially as described (17Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol.

Substrate proteins produced by in vitro translation were resuspended in 5 μl of buffer (25% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4), added to 20 μl of ATP-depleted reticulocyte, and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C to allow removal of the N-terminal ubiquitin by deubiquitinating enzymes (38Gonda D.K.

Ubiquitination and degradation were initiated by addition of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (2 mm ATP, 10 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase; final concentrations), and incubation continued at 25 °C. At designated time points, 2.4-μl aliquots were transferred to 20 μl of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electronic autoradiography (17Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). For the degradation of reduced substrate, protein substrate was preincubated with 10 mm DTT for 2 min. Degradation was strictly dependent on a destabilizing N-terminal amino acid (arginineversus methionine) and ATP and was inhibited between 2- and 5-fold by the dipeptide Arg-Ala (10 mm, data not shown), which suppresses ubiquitination (39Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the degradation of proteasome substrates in which loops were introduced into the polypeptide chain by disulfide bridges. The substrate proteins consisted of three parts: an N-terminal targeting region, a barnase domain, and finally a DHFR domain (Fig.1). To prevent specific parts of the substrate protein from unfolding, we introduced covalent cross-links into the barnase domain by mutating pairs of residues to cysteine at positions that allow disulfide bridge formation upon oxidation (36Schwartz M.P. Huang S. Matouschek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,37Clarke J. Hendrick K. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The disulfide bridges were introduced at three different positions, Cys43–Cys80, Cys70–Cys92, and Cys85–Cys102 (the numbering refers to the residue position within the barnase domain). In addition to fusion proteins with these three single disulfide bridges, we constructed all combinations of double disulfide bridge mutants and a fusion protein with all three disulfide bridges present simultaneously. After synthesis of radioactively labeled fusion proteins by in vitro transcription and translation, disulfide bridge formation was induced by oxidation with ferricyanide, as described previously (36Schwartz M.P. Huang S. Matouschek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Disulfide bridge formation was complete, and no unreacted cysteine residues could be detected with the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent SDSM (data not shown). The constructs were targeted to the proteasome in reticulocyte lysate by the N-end rule pathway (34Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and ubiquitination occurred on two lysine residues in a 40-amino acid linker at the N termini of the fusion proteins (35Bachmair A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1989; 56: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We first sought to determine whether a polypeptide loop could be translocated through the degradation channel. To address this question, we measured the effect of intramolecular disulfide bridges within the barnase domain on degradation of the fusion protein by the proteasome. Because disulfide bonds are covalent cross-links, they persist after a protein is unfolded and introduce a permanent polypeptide loop into the primary structure (see below). Radiolabeled fusion proteins were synthesized by coupled in vitrotranscription and translation in E. coli S30 extract, and disulfide bridge formation was induced by oxidation (36Schwartz M.P. Huang S. Matouschek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After partial purification, the proteins were incubated in reticulocyte lysate, and their degradation was monitored by SDS-PAGE and electronic autoradiography (Fig. 2). Degradation occurred with the same half-time of 25–30 min for fusion proteins without cross-links and those containing a single disulfide bridge (Fig. 2 F). The same degradation kinetics were also obtained when disulfide bridges were reduced by DTT before assaying for degradation. The proteasome degrades proteins consisting of multiple domains sequentially beginning with the degradation signal (17Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the cross-links blocked complete degradation, we would expect proteolysis of the substrates up to the first disulfide bridge and the accumulation of the remainder of the polypeptide chain. However, no partially degraded substrate proteins could be detected (Fig. 2, B and D). Together, these results suggest that single cross-links within a substrate protein do not affect degradation by the proteasome and that the degradation channel through the proteasome can tolerate at least one loop in a polypeptide chain. Next, we tested how much steric bulk in the substrate protein can be tolerated by the proteasomal degradation channel. For this purpose, we increased the number of disulfide bonds in barnase. As substrates were forced to retain more residual structure during degradation, both the rates and extent of degradation decreased. In a sequentially degraded substrate, the amount of steric bulk introduced by disulfide bridges depends on the location of the cross-links within the polypeptide chain. We analyzed three different mutants containing two disulfide bridges. In two mutants, Cys43–Cys80/Cys70–Cys92and Cys70–Cys92/Cys85–Cys102, the first cysteine in the amino acid sequence forms a cross-link with the third cysteine, and the second cysteine forms a cross-link with the fourth cysteine. In both of these mutants, the cysteine residues are spaced so that the second cross-link does not introduce a new loop into the polypeptide chain during sequential degradation from the N terminus (Fig. 1 C). When these proteins are degraded from their N termini, three strands of the polypeptide chain have to pass through the degradation channel simultaneously. Degradation rates of Cys43–Cys80/Cys70–Cys92and Cys70–Cys92/Cys85–Cys102were similar to those of substrates lacking disulfide bridges (Fig. 2and data not shown). In a third mutant, Cys43–Cys80/Cys85–Cys102, the first two cysteine residues in the polypeptide chain cross-link with each other, and the third and fourth cysteine cross-link with each other. In this mutant, the two disulfide bridges introduce separate loops into the polypeptide. Both loops have to pass through the degradation channel simultaneously during sequential degradation from the N terminus (Fig. 1 C). The cross-links introduced in this mutant reduced the degradation rate to a small but reproducible extent (Fig. 2 F). Introduction of a third disulfide bridge to create the mutant Cys43–Cys80/Cys70–Cys92/Cys85–Cys102reduced degradation rates further (Fig. 2 F). In addition, the extent of degradation was reduced to ∼60% of that of a substrate lacking cross-links. For all proteins, reducing the disulfide bridges with DTT restored the rates and extent of degradation to that of substrates lacking cysteine residues (Fig. 2 E). It is unlikely that the disulfide bridges affected the ubiquitination step because the ubiquitination sites are far away from the folded barnase domain and none of the single disulfide bridges affected degradation (see also below). Disulfide bridges can affect the stability of the folded substrate protein against global unfolding (40Clarke J. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of degradation induced by the cross-links could be caused by the stabilization of the native protein against unfolding rather than by the residual structure in denatured barnase. We could differentiate between these two cases by introducing an additional destabilizing mutation in the protein containing three disulfide bridges. The Ile25 → Ala mutation destabilizes barnase by 3.5 kcal/mol and accelerates unfolding rates to a similar extent (Ref. 41Serrano L. Kellis Jr, J.T. Cann P. Matouschek A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 783-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar and data not shown). The mutation did not accelerate degradation of the substrate containing three disulfide bridges, independently of whether these disulfide bridges were formed or not (Fig. 2 G). This result suggests that the decreased degradation of the triple disulfide mutant is not due to any stabilization of the native state. Instead, the degradation is presumably inhibited by the residual structure in the unfolded substrate exerting steric hindrance on the translocation of the polypeptide. The degradation of disulfide cross-linked substrates could also occur if the proteasome were able to break disulfide bridges during degradation. Degradation of substrates with multiple disulfide bridges would then be delayed because of the time it takes to break multiple cross-links. To test for this possibility, we compared the sizes of end products produced when the C-terminal DHFR domain of the substrate proteins was stabilized by ligand binding. Methotrexate binding stabilizes DHFR against unfolding and protects it from proteolysis by the proteasome (15Johnston J.A. Johnson E.S. Waller P.R.H. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Stabilization of the DHFR domain allows degradation of the N-terminal portion of the substrate including part of the barnase domain. Degradation stops at a point in the polypeptide chain that is ∼90 amino acids upstream of the DHFR domain (17Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 B, lane 2). The undegraded 90-amino acid tail must stretch from the proteolytic sites to the entrance to the degradation channel where the folded DHFR domain becomes stuck. All the residues involved in cross-links are contained within this tail. When the structure of the undegraded tail becomes restricted by cross-links, more than 90 amino acids may be required to bridge the distance between proteolytic sites and the entrance to the degradation channel (Fig. 3 A). Thus, intact disulfide bridges in the barnase domain could cause the accumulation of degradation products with longer undegraded tails when DHFR is stabilized. This is indeed what we observed. As increasing amounts of disulfide bridges are introduced into the substrate protein, the mobility of the degradation end product in SDS-PAGE decreases (Fig.3 B). For the constructs containing two or three disulfide bridges, no or only very little degradation product of the size found for precursors lacking disulfide bridges can be detected (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 8 and 9 withlane 2). This result indicates that disulfide formation was complete and that the cross-links are maintained throughout the degradation reaction. When disulfide bonds were reduced before degradation, the end products of degradation all showed the same mobility on SDS-PAGE as the substrate lacking cysteine residues (data not shown). Together these results show that the proteasome does not reduce the disulfide bonds during degradation. In addition, the findings demonstrate that disulfide bond formation did not interfere with proteasome targeting because all substrate proteins were processed irrespective of the number of disulfide bridges. Can multiple strands of a polypeptide chain pass through the degradation channel in the proteasome simultaneously? Crystal structures of the yeast proteasome core particle in complex with the caps show that the axial pore has a diameter of ∼13 Å (11Whitby F.G. Masters E.I. Kramer L. Knowlton J.R. Yao Y. Wang C.C. Hill C.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 12Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The degradation channel in the archebacterial proteasome has restrictions that are smaller than 20 Å as judged by the crystal structure (6Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) and the observation that a gold particle with a diameter of ∼ 20Å attached to a substrate protein could not enter the archebacterial proteasome (42Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These size restrictions are presumably the reason that even small folded proteins such as DHFR cannot be degraded without prior unfolding (15Johnston J.A. Johnson E.S. Waller P.R.H. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Three extended polypeptide chains packed against each other are expected to have diameters in the range of 13–20 Å. We found that forcing three polypeptide chains to pass through the degradation channel by introducing one or two disulfide bridges into a substrate protein does not affect degradation rates (Fig. 2 F). In these experiments, the degradation rate was not limited by the unfolding of the substrate protein (Fig.2 G) but presumably by substrate enzyme encounter because of the small concentrations of both substrate and protease. Therefore, we cannot rule out that the steric bulk introduced into the substrate would have a small effect if translocation were rate-determining for degradation. Increasing the amount of residual structure in the translocating substrate protein further by positioning two disulfide bridges appropriately or by introducing a third disulfide bridge leads to a small but reproducible decrease in degradation rates (Fig.2 F). This result suggests that the proteasome channel is sufficiently wide or flexible for the concurrent passage of five polypeptide chains. A similar result was obtained for the bacterial ATP-dependent protease ClpXP. ClpXP degrades dimeric P22 Arc repressor bearing a C-terminal SsrA tag with similar efficiencies whether or not the two subunits are cross-linked with a disulfide bridge (43Burton R.E. Siddiqui S.M. Kim Y.I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3092-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An example of an unrelated protein translocation pore that allows concomitant passage of five polypeptide strands is the mitochondrial protein import channel (36Schwartz M.P. Huang S. Matouschek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 44Schwartz M.P. Matouschek A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13086-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There are several situations in which more than one polypeptide chain may pass simultaneously through the proteasome degradation channel in the cell. Degradation from an internal site may be responsible for the activation of the yeast transcription factors Spt23p and Mga2p (30Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Mga2p and Spt23p are activated when degradation of their C-terminal portions by the proteasome releases their N-terminal DNA binding and activation domains (30Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The C termini of Spt23p and Mga2p are anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, processing of these transcription factors has to begin either with an endoproteolytic cleavage by another protease or by the insertion of a loop of the polypeptide chain through the proteasomal degradation channel. Our results suggest that there are no steric constraints to the insertion of two polypetide chains into the proteasome and therefore no structural requirement of an endoproteolytic cut. Sequential degradation of a protein from an internal ubiquitination site appears possible. The ability of the proteasome to degrade a protein from an internal site may also be important for the removal of misfolded proteins. Furthermore, a flexible degradation channel will allow the proteolysis of proteins carrying larger modifications, such as O-linked carbohydrates. Thus, a degradation channel that can tolerate some steric bulk may reconcile the two opposing needs for a cellular degradation machine that is compartmentalized to avoid aberrant degradation yet able to handle a range of substrates of various sizes. Another situation in which more than one polypeptide chain may pass through the degradation channel simultaneously occurs when ubiquitin modifications are degraded together with the protease substrate. In yeast, the deubiquitinating enzyme Doa4 is associated with the 26 S proteasome (45Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 46Amerik A.Y. Nowak J. Swaminathan S. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3365-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking Doa4 are significantly depleted of ubiquitin, and genetic evidence shows that the proteasome is at least partially responsible for the degradation of ubiquitin (45Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar,46Amerik A.Y. Nowak J. Swaminathan S. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3365-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A similar situation occurs when the deubiquitinating activity is inhibited by ubiquitin-aldehyde (47Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin chains are assembled through isopeptide bonds between a lysine side chain in the substrate or a ubiquitin moiety already attached to the substrate and the C-terminal carboxyl group of the next ubiquitin. Therefore, sequential degradation of a substrate protein without prior release of the ubiquitin moieties would require several polypeptide chains to pass through the degradation channel simultaneously. Finally, our results may also have implications on the conformation of the polypeptide chain during translocation. When a protease-resistant domain stops the sequential degradation of a multidomain protein, the last proteolytic cleavage occurs some 90 amino acids for the beginning of the resistant domain (17Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In a fully extended conformation, a 90-amino acid polypeptide is longer than would be required to bridge the distance from the entrance of the degradation channel to the proteolytic sites. One possible explanation for such a long undegraded chain is that the unfolded substrate protein is pushed through the proteasome channel from the entrance. The protein then fills up the degradation channel until the front end is pushed into catalytic chamber. An alternative explanation would be that polypeptide chain follows a defined, if complex, path from the regulatory caps to the catalytic sites of the β-rings. Our results appear to rule out the first scenario because that scenario predicts that cross-links in the polypeptide chain do not affect the length of the undegraded tail.

Low concentrations (1 μm) of MK886 selectively sensitized the permeability transition pore (PTP) to opening, whereas higher concentrations of MK886 (10 μm) caused depolarization through combination of an ionophoretic effect with inhibition of respiration. MK886 killed prostate cancer PC3 cells only at the higher, toxic concentration (10 μm), whereas the lower concentration (1 μm) had no major effect on cell survival. However, 1 μm MK886 alone demonstrably induced PTP-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction; and it caused cell death through the mitochondrial pathway when it was used in combination with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, which had no effectsper se.

The PT may also be instrumental in the release of the apoptogenic proteins, and this may be particularly important for large proteins that do not possess a selective permeability pathway (1Bernardi P. Petronilli V., Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The PT is modulated by a variety of factors involved in intracellular signaling (10Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), and among these arachidonic acid (11Scorrano L. Penzo D. Petronilli V. Pagano F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) is particularly interesting in the context of tumor cell biology. Arachidonic acid is released by activated phospholipases A2and then converted into prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes by COX, and into leukotrienes by LOX (12Ara G. Teicher B.A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1996; 54: 3-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N.

The role of arachidonic acid in tumor formation/progression is not easy to address because two opposing effects may overlap. Indeed, arachidonic acid may favor cell survival through its COX and LOX metabolites (15Hong K.H. Bonventre J.C. O'Leary E. Bonventre J.V. Lander E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An important link between arachidonic acid metabolism and the mitochondrial proapoptotic pathway is suggested by the findings that apoptosis induction by arachidonic acid involved activation of caspase-3, a process that is amplified by release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (2Liu X.

Studies on the role of 5-LOX metabolites in cancer cell survival have revealed a strong proapoptotic effect of micromolar concentrations of the 5-LOX inhibitor 3-[3-tert-butylsulfanyl-1- (4-chlorobenzyl)-5-isopropyl-1H-indol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethylpropionic acid, commonly known as MK886, an indole-based multifunctional derivative (Refs. 24Anderson K.M.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar for review). Interestingly, MK886-induced death of cancer PC3 cells was preceded by mitochondrial depolarization, but the mechanistic basis for this observation remains unclear (28Ghosh J. Myers C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism of mitochondrial depolarization by MK886, and its possible relationship with arachidonic acid metabolism, induction of the PT and cell death, we have investigated the effects of MK886 on isolated mitochondria and intact cells. We show that MK886 has prominent effects on mitochondria that may represent the basis for its cytotoxicity. Indeed, low concentrations (1 μm) of MK886 selectively sensitized the permeability transition pore (PTP) to opening, whereas higher concentrations (10 μm) caused depolarization through combination of an ionophoretic effect with inhibition of respiration. MK886 killed prostate cancer PC3 cells only at the higher concentration, whereas the lower concentration had no major effect on cell survival. However, 1 μm MK886 demonstrably induced PTPdependent mitochondrial dysfunction, and it caused cell death through the mitochondrial pathway when it was used in combination with the COX inhibitor, indomethacin, at concentrations of the latter that had no effects per se. Combination of low concentrations of MK886 with a COX inhibitor may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to force cell death through the mitochondrial pathway, and this approach should be specifically useful to kill cells possessing a high flux of arachidonic acid and its metabolites like prostate and colon cancer cells. Liver mitochondria were prepared by standard centrifugation techniques from albino Wistar rats weighing ∼300 g (32Costantini P. Petronilli V. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Toxicology. 1995; 99: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial swelling was followed as the change of light scattering of the mitochondrial suspension at 545 nm. The experiments were performed with a Hitachi PerkinElmer 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation and emission slits of 1 nm. Oxygen consumption was determined polarographically using a Clark oxygen electrode. All assays were performed at 25 °C in instruments equipped with thermostatic control and magnetic stirring. PC3 human prostate cancer cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum plus 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a Forma tissue culture water-jacketed incubator. The RPMI medium and the supplements were purchased from Sigma. For fluorescence microscopy with TMRM, PC3 cells (50 × 103) were seeded onto round glass coverslips in six-well plates. Following the various treatments described in the figure legends, cells were washed and incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution in presence of 20 nm TMRM and either 1 μm CsH or 1 μm CsA for 30 min at 37 °C. Treatment of control cells with CsH is necessary because the extent of cell and hence mitochondrial loading with potentiometric probes is affected by the activity of the plasma membrane multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, which is inhibited by both CsH and CsA, whereas only CsA inhibits the PTP (33Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Recordings were started after equilibration of TMRM for 5 min at room temperature. Cell fluorescence images were acquired with an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope equipped with a xenon light source (75 watts), a 12-bit digital cooled CCD camera (Micromax, Princeton Instruments), excitation and emission wavelength filter settings at bandpass 525 ± 25 nm to 590 longpass (TMRM). Images were acquired with a 40×, 1.3 numeric aperture oil immersion objective (Nikon) at 2-min intervals (exposure time, 80 ms), and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Clusters of several mitochondria were considered as regions of interest (ROIs), and the fluorescence signal was corrected for the background (fields not containing cells). ROI fluorescence intensities are reported either as such (Fig. 5) or after normalization of the initial fluorescence for comparative purposes (Fig. 3). Data are the mean of 10 ROIs from 10 different experiments. TMRM and Fluo-3 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) andCalbiochem, respectively; CsH and CsA were generous gifts from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland).FIG. 3Effects of MK886 on TMRM fluorescence in PC3 cells. PC3 cells grown on coverslips in six-well plates were rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and loaded with 20 nm TMRM, and fluorescence was monitored as described under “Materials and Methods.” The graphs report the changes of TMRM fluorescence intensity over mitochondrial ROI. In the experiments denoted by open squares, cells were loaded in presence of 1 μm CsH, whereas, in the experiments denoted by filled squares, cells were loaded in presence of 1 μm CsA. The arrows indicate the addition of MK886 (1 μm in panel A, 3 μm in panel B, and 10 μm in panel C) or FCCP (2 μm). Values are mean ± S.E. of 10 different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell viability was assessed with one of two methods. In the experiments reported in Fig. 4, cells were grown in 24-well plates (12.5 × 103 cells/well), treated as described in the figure legend, washed with serum-free medium, and finally incubated for 15 min at 25 °C with 1 μm propidium iodide in PBS. Three randomly selected fields were acquired from each coverslip using excitation/emission cubes of 568/585 longpass. The corresponding bright field images were also acquired, and the three channels were overlaid using the appropriate function of Metamorph software. In the experiments of Fig. 6, cells were grown in 96-well microtiter plates (8.5 × 103 cells/well), treated as described in the figure legends and viability was assessed based on the resazurin (Sigma) assay as described in Ref. 34O'Brien J. Wilson I. Orton T. Pognan F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5421-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar. Briefly, the incubation medium was removed by aspiration, and serum-free RMPI 1640 growth medium containing 10% (v/v) resazurin was added (0.1 ml/well). The ratio of reduced to oxidized resazurin (which reflects the metabolic activity of viable cells) was detected at 540/620 nm. We verified that the ratio increased linearly with the number of cells in the range of cell densities used in the experiments.FIG. 6Effects of indomethacin and MK886 on the cytotoxicity of arachidonic acid in PC3 cells. PC3 cells (8.5 × 103) were seeded in 96-well plates in serum free-medium and kept in the CO2 incubator in the presence of the concentrations of arachidonic acid indicated in theabscissa. Cells were either incubated without further treatment (black bars) or supplemented with 10 μm indomethacin (striped bars), 1 μm MK886 (gray bars), or both (hatched bars). After 24 h, viable cells were estimated with the resazurin assay as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the experiments of Fig. 1(panel A), mitochondria energized with glutamate plus malate (triangles), with succinate in the presence of rotenone (circles), or with ascorbate plus TMPD (squares) were treated with increasing concentrations of MK886, and oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark oxygen electrode. It can be seen that MK886 caused a concentration-dependent increase of respiration, which reached a plateau at slightly less than 10 μm MK886, irrespective of the substrate being oxidized. At concentrations of 10 μm or higher, on the other hand, MK886 instead caused inhibition of respiration with glutamate, malate, or succinate as the substrates, but not with ascorbate plus TMPD (panel A). The inhibitory effect of MK886 on respiration was then studied in mitochondria treated with the uncoupler DNP. The experiments of Fig. 1 (panel B) show that MK886 inhibited respiration in the same concentration range causing uncoupling, and that inhibition was not observed when ascorbate plus TMPD were the substrates. These experiments demonstrate that MK886 has direct effects on mitochondria, where it causes uncoupling, and respiratory inhibition at complex III (and possibly at complex I) but not at complex IV. These relatively high concentrations of MK886 (above 5 μm), which are typically employed in studies of cytotoxicity, also permeabilized mitochondria to K+, Na+, and Ca2+, but not to choline or sucrose (results not shown). It should be noted that these experiments were carried out in the presence of CsA, to prevent PTP opening and the accompanying changes of respiration that range from uncoupling to respiratory inhibition depending on the substrates being used (see Ref. 10Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar for discussion). We next assessed whether MK886 had effects on the PTP. Because the PTP is voltage-dependent (35Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MK886 concentrations causing uncoupling and respiratory inhibition (and therefore depolarization) cannot be used, because these would cause PTP opening through depolarization. We therefore chose a low concentration of MK886 (1 μm), which had negligible effects on respiration (Fig. 1) and on energy coupling, as demonstrated by the lack of effects on the resting membrane potential and on the profile of membrane depolarization obtained by uncoupler titrations (results not shown). We tested whether 1 μm MK886 would sensitize PTP opening by low concentrations of uncoupler, a method that allows to assess shifts in the PTP voltage threshold (36Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments of Fig.2 (panel A), mitochondrial volume was monitored as the absorbance of the mitochondrial suspension in a sucrose-based medium at 545 nm, and the fraction (Φ) of mitochondria that responded to the various treatments with PTP opening was determined as previously described (36Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were first loaded with a small amount of Ca2+, which per se did not cause any effects on PTP opening (trace a). The subsequent addition of 60 nm FCCP caused PTP opening in a small fraction of the mitochondria (trace b), indicating that after addition of the uncoupler the membrane potential was still more negative than the threshold voltage required for PTP opening in the majority of mitochondria. Treatment with 1 μm MK886 dramatically affected the mitochondrial response to 60 nmFCCP, which was now followed by PTP opening in nearly all mitochondria (trace c) and could be completely prevented by CsA (trace d). Fig. 2 (panel B) reports the quantitative assessment of the dependence of PTP opening on the concentration of FCCP in the absence (open symbols) or presence (closed symbols) of 1 μm MK886. It can be seen that MK886 sensitized PTP opening by uncoupler, which could be observed at FCCP concentrations between 40 and 60 nm. These experiments indicate that MK886 is a PTP sensitizer at a concentration that causes negligible effects on mitochondrial coupling and respiration. We next carried out a series of determinations on the effects of MK886 on the membrane potential maintained by mitochondria in PC3 cellsin situ based on the accumulation of the potentiometric probe TMRM (33Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 (panel A) documents that the addition of 1 μm MK886 had negligible effects on TMRM fluorescence irrespective of whether CsA was present or not (closed and open symbols, respectively). When the concentration was raised to 3 μm (panel B), MK886 caused a decrease of TMRM fluorescence that is consistent with in situ mitochondrial depolarization (open symbols). This event could be significantly inhibited by CsA (closed symbols), suggesting that PTP opening was involved in membrane depolarization by this concentration of MK886. A further increase of the MK886 concentration to 10 μmcaused a rapid mitochondrial depolarization that was instead insensitive to CsA (panel C). These experiments demonstrate that MK886 affected mitochondria in situ in a manner that is consistent with its effects in isolated mitochondria. At low concentrations it sensitized the PTP to opening, whereas at higher concentrations it caused direct mitochondrial depolarization, possibly through a combination of its ionophoretic and inhibitory effects on respiration. Because cell death is generally observed only at the higher concentrations of MK886 (27Anderson K.M. Seed T. Vos M. Mulshine J. Meng J. Alrefai W., Ou, D. Harris J.E. Prostate. 1998; 37: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Ghosh J. Myers C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), it is legitimate to ask whether mitochondrial dysfunction rather than LOX inhibition is the major event in cell death induced by MK886. We confirmed that 10 μm MK886 depolarizes mitochondria in situ(Fig. 3, panel C) (28Ghosh J. Myers C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and that it rapidly causes the death of PC3 cells (results not shown). We then investigated the effects of 1 μm MK886, a concentration that did not directly affect energy coupling (Fig. 1) and did not cause measurable effects on the mitochondrial membrane potential in situ(Fig. 3), but inhibits LOX in PC3 cells, IC50 for inhibition of LOX being ∼3 nm (37Vickers P.J. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the experiments of Fig. 4, PC3 cells were incubated in serum-free medium for up to 6 days, a condition that did not affect the survival of control cells (black bars). It can be seen that cell survival was not significantly affected by treatment with 1 μm MK886 (gray bars), indicating that inhibition of 5-LOX as such was not sufficient to kill PC3 cells under these conditions. Likewise, the COX inhibitor indomethacin was not cytotoxic (striped bars), suggesting that prostaglandins and other COX metabolites were not essential survival factors for PC3 cells. However, a clear cytotoxic effect was observed when 1 μm MK886 was added together with indomethacin (hatched bars). Similar results were obtained in complete medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, but the cytotoxic concentrations of MK886 were higher, possibly because of binding to serum components (results not shown). To explore the status of mitochondrial function during treatment with MK886 and indomethacin, we studied mitochondrial TMRM accumulation at 2, 4, and 6 days into the various treatments. The striking resistance to serum starvation of PC3 cells (Fig. 4) was matched by maintenance of a normal accumulation of TMRM by mitochondria for up to 6 days (Fig.5, panels A, A′, and A”, open symbols). TMRM accumulation was not significantly affected by treatment with CsA (panels A, A′, and A”, closed symbols) nor by the addition of oligomycin (panels A, A′, and A”, arrowheads marked O). This latter finding indicates that throughout the period of serum starvation the mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained by respiration rather than by hydrolysis of glycolytic ATP. Finally, the expected probe release readily followed addition of the uncoupler FCCP (panels A, A′, and A”, arrowheads markedF). When 10 μm indomethacin was added to the serum-free medium, TMRM accumulation and its response to CsA or oligomycin were indistinguishable from those of untreated cells at 2 and 4 days of incubation (Fig. 5, panels B and B′, respectively; symbols are the same as in panels A). After 6 days, on the other hand, TMRM accumulation was somewhat lower in the absence of CsA (panel B”), suggesting that increased PTP flickering might have ensued, causing in turn a lower steady-state mitochondrial membrane potential. Interestingly, addition of oligomycin was followed by mitochondrial depolarization (panel B”, arrowhead O), suggesting that mitochondria were maintaining the membrane potential by ATP hydrolysis, but overall cell survival was still unaffected despite the impending mitochondrial dysfunction (compare with Fig. 4). In the presence of 1 μm MK886, mitochondrial dysfunction was readily detectable at 2 and 4 days of incubation (Fig. 5, panels C and C′, respectively). Indeed, TMRM accumulation was lower, and could be increased by CsA (closed symbols in both panels); and oligomycin caused mitochondrial depolarization. After 6 days of treatment with MK886, the accumulation of TMRM decreased further and became unresponsive to CsA, but cells were still able to survive (compare with Fig. 4). When both 1 μm MK886 and 10 μm indomethacin were added together, mitochondrial accumulation of TMRM was already decreased after 2 days (Fig. 5, panel D), indicating early onset of mitochondrial dysfunction that was also detectable at 4 and 6 days of treatment (panels D′ and D”, respectively). It should be recalled that treatment with 1 μm MK886 and 10 μm indomethacin caused relevant cell death at all time points (Fig. 4). These assays therefore underestimate mitochondrial dysfunction because they can only be performed on the survivors (i.e. the most resistant cells). It appears legitimate to conclude that, after treatment with the combination of 1 μm MK886 and 10 μmindomethacin, mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event that precedes overt cell death. It should be mentioned that the cellular effects of MK886 could not be mimicked by the LOX inhibitor caffeic acid, which also had no detectable effects on isolated mitochondria (results not shown). We finally tested the effects of MK886 and indomethacin on the viability of cells that had been treated with concentrations of arachidonic acid ranging between 1 and 10 μm. The experiments of Fig. 6 document that the combination of 1 μm MK886 and 10 μmindomethacin caused cell death within 24 h of the addition of 5 μm arachidonic acid, which was otherwise devoid of effects on cell survival. A similar effect was observed at 10 μm arachidonic acid, although the response was less clear-cut because of the onset of cytotoxicity by arachidonic acid alone. These results indicate that treatment with MK886 plus indomethacin sensitizes PC3 cells to the cytotoxic effects of added arachidonic acid. MK886 is unique among inhibitors of 5-LOX in that it acts on an arachidonic acid transfer protein, FLAP, which delivers the substrate to LOX (38Mancini J.A. Abramovitz M. Cox M.E. Wong E.

Given the high reactivity of NO, we hypothesized that optimal NO regulation of polarized epithelial functions is achieved through compartmentalization of iNOS, allowing local NO delivery to its molecular targets. Here, we show that iNOS localizes to the apical domain of epithelial cells within a submembranous protein complex tightly bound to cortical actin. We further show that iNOS can bind to the apical PDZ protein, EBP50 (ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50), an interaction that is dependent on the last three COOH-terminal amino acids of iNOS, SAL, but requires the presence of additional unknown cellular proteins. Mutation of these three COOH-terminal residues abolishes the iNOS-EBP50 interaction and disrupts the apical association of iNOS in transfected cells, showing that this COOH-terminal motif is essential for the correct localization of iNOS in epithelial cells. Apically localized iNOS directs vectorial NO production at the apical proximal tubule epithelial cell surface.

The role of high NO output from iNOS in epithelial cells is unclear, although there is increasing evidence that epithelial NO exerts its effects on polarized cell functions. For example, NO modulates the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) (4Dong Y.J. Chao A.C. Kouyama K. Hsu Y.P. Bocian R.C. Moss R.B. Gardner P.

Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that endogenous NO-dependent regulation of apical epithelial functions, such as solute transport, might optimally be achieved through localization of iNOS to the apical cell compartment, allowing local NO delivery to its molecular targets. How might iNOS be targeted to the apical cell compartment? Recent studies have shown that PDZ domain-containing proteins play an important role in trafficking, sorting, and retention of several apical proteins (7Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin.

Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). EBP50 also exerts regulatory effects on its binding partners; for example, EBP50 confers cyclic AMP-mediated regulation of NHE3 (11Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of the last three COOH-terminal residues of human iNOS shows that they contain a potential PDZ domain-binding motif, SAL (13Charles I.G. Palmer R.M. Hickery M.S. Bayliss M.T. Chubb A.P. Hall V.S. Moss D.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11419-11423Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). One possibility may be, therefore, that iNOS could interact with a PDZ domain via its three COOH-terminal amino acids. In this study, we show for the first time that iNOS localizes to the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells in association with the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Further, we show that iNOS can bind to the PDZ protein EBP50 via its three COOH-terminal amino acids. These residues are also found to be essential for the correct apical localization of iNOS within epithelial cells. We demonstrate that iNOS produces NO in a vectorial manner predominantly at the apical cell surface. This work defines epithelial iNOS as a polarized apical protein and provides a mechanism whereby locally delivered NO may influence polarized epithelial cell functions. iNOS, EBP50, E-cadherin, and caveolin-1 monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories.

Interleukin 1α, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ were from Peprotech. pGEX-6P-1 was fromAmersham Biosciences. Unless stated otherwise, all other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. Primary human PTEC cultures were established in serum-free medium as described (15Glynne P.A. Evans T.J. Septic Shock: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 197-205Google Scholar). Human bronchial epithelial 16HBE14o− cells (a gift from Dr D. Gruenert, University of California, San Francisco), grown in RPMI 1640/10% FCS, were stably transfected with human iNOS cDNA (a gift from Dr. I. Charles, Wellcome Laboratories) cloned into theXbaI sites of the expression vector pCI-neo (Promega) using Perfectlipid 6 (Invitrogen). iNOS-expressing and control cells were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of G418. iNOS expression in 50% of the cells was achieved after 48 h of incubation with 5 mmn-butyric acid. A similar approach was used to derive stable iNOS transfectants in MDCK II cells (a kind gift from K. Mostov, University of California). For each construct ≥2 independent clones were analyzed with identical results. Cells were polarized by growth on a semipermeable support with separate apical and basolateral chambers (Anapore filters, Nunc, Abingdon, UK) NO was measured as nitrate + nitrite (NOx) using the Griess assay following reduction of nitrate to nitrite (16Archer S. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Vectorial NO output was measured by the hemoglobin method (17Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). iNOS activity was assayed by arginine to citrulline conversion (NOSdetect™, Stratagene). NO production was inhibited by the iNOS inhibitorl-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (l-NIL; Calbiochem). Cells grown on Anopore filters (Nalgene Nunc) were immunostained as described (14Evans T.J. Buttery L.D. Carpenter A. Springall D.R. Polak J.M. Cohen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 9553-9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). iNOS was visualized using the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (1 h) and fluorescein avidin (1 h) (both diluted 1:200). ZO-1 and EBP50 were visualized using Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500). Cells were mounted in Vectashield® and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 1024 running LaserSharp software). iNOS-expressing cells were quantified as the percentage of the area of the epithelial sheet in a given micrograph using NIH Image software, version 1.62, to measure the area of stained cells with pixel intensity above the threshold level. Apical iNOS staining was quantified by determining the mean fluorescence intensities of apical and cytoplasmic areas of the cell and then subtracting the background value measured over the nucleus. The product of the mean fluorescent intensity and the measured area was used to determine the relative amounts of iNOS in each compartment. All protocols were performed at 4 °C. PTEC were washed three times in PBS, scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 3 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by Dounce homogenization and sonication. After the nuclei were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the remaining low speed supernatant (LSS) was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h to yield a high speed supernatant (HSS) (cytosol) and pellet (HSP) (particulate fraction). Fractions analyzed for iNOS by Western blotting were developed using ECL and quantified by digital densitometry. The HSP was resuspended in 1 of ml lysis buffer and overlaid onto a 20–55% linear sucrose gradient (11.5 ml) over a 0.5 ml 64% sucrose cushion. Following centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C, fractions (0.7 ml) were collected from the bottom of the gradient and analyzed by immunoblotting. The HSP was resuspended in either 0.25 or 1.0 m KCl, 0.1 mNa2CO3, 0.1 m NaOH, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% Triton X-100 ± 250 mm NaCl, or 0.1% SDS in lysis buffer. Membranes were extracted at 0 °C for 10 min (Na2CO3 and NaOH) or 60 min (remainder) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h, and supernatants and pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting. The 10 COOH-terminal residues of human iNOS (sequence data available from GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. X73029) were cloned in pGEX-6P-1 after annealing sense (GATCCCAGCCCAGCCTGGAGATGTCAGCGCTCTGAG) and antisense (AATTCTCAGAGCGCTGACATCTCCAGGCTGCTGGGCTGG) oligonucleotides at 95 °C for 10 min (GST-iNOSwt). The mutated construct (GST-iNOSmut) was made by substituting the three COOH-terminal residues, SAL, with DGR. Constructs were checked by sequencing. Fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The COOH terminus of iNOS was altered to MDGR using PCR with the primers CCCCAAGCTCTACACCTCCAATG (forward) and CAGCGTCGACTCATCTTCCATCCATCTCCAGGCTGCTGGGCTGCACCGCCAC (reverse) using iNOS cDNA as probe. The product was digested withSalI and NsiI, and this fragment was substituted into full-length iNOS in pCI cut with the same enzymes. The full-length insert was then cloned into pCI-neo and verified by sequence analysis. The LSS from cells lysed in lysis buffer + 1% Triton X-100 was incubated with 10 μg of GST fusion protein beads for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Bound proteins were washed five times with lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. A similar approach was used to study the binding of pure EBP50. EBP50 cDNA (a kind gift of Dr. A. Bretscher) was cloned in-frame into the expression vector pcDNAHisMaxTA (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). This construct was transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), and the protein was purified from cell lysates 24 h later using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The protein was 95% pure as judged by Coomassie staining of protein run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Data are reported as the means ± S.E. The level of significance, p, of differences from controls was calculated using Student’s two-tailed t test.p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. We first established optimal conditions for iNOS induction in human PTEC. Stimulation of PTEC with 10 ng/ml interleukin 1α, 200 units/ml interferon-γ, and 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α for 24 h produced maximal NOx release compared with unstimulated cells (128.14 ± 13.2 nmol/million cells 24 h−1versus 19.75 ± 10.96,p < 0.01, n = 3). Where indicated, this cytokine mixture was used in all experiments. PTEC NO synthase activity was calcium-independent in total cell lysates and increased significantly after cytokine treatment compared with unstimulated cells (66.08 ± 0.09 pmol/mg versus 0.025 ± 0.002 pmol/mg respectively, p < 0.05, n = 2). iNOS induction was confirmed by identification of a 135-kDa protein in cytokine-treated PTEC by Western blotting. These results showed that NO production from cytokine-stimulated PTEC was iNOS-dependent. In addition, there is constitutive iNOS activity in unstimulated cells. The subcellular distribution of iNOS was examined by immunocytochemistry using two different iNOS antibodies, and identical results were obtained with each antibody. iNOS staining was not detected in unstimulated PTEC. Following cytokine treatment, iNOS was induced in a proportion of PTEC (median value of 7.75% iNOS positive cells/high power field in eight separate experiments). Confocal microscopy showed that iNOS localized to the apical domain (Fig.1A, green staining,panels 1, 4, and 7) above the tight junction marker ZO-1 (Fig. 1A, red staining, panel 2), which delineates the transition between the apical and basolateral domains of a polarized epithelial cell. Note in these cells that ZO-1 staining is confined to a limited area at the junction between cells that does not extend to the basal surface of the cells (indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 1A, panels 1–3). In addition, iNOS was found to colocalize with the apical marker EBP50 (Fig. 1A, panels 4–9). This pattern of apical staining was observed in all iNOS positive cells analyzed in polarized PTEC monolayers (from eight kidney preparations). The distribution of iNOS within PTEC, quantified by image analysis, showed that 73.4 ± 4.22% of iNOS was located in the apical compartment. The apical localization of iNOS is also seen in epithelial cells stably transfected with iNOS expression vectors. These were derived for MDCK cells (Fig. 1B) and the respiratory epithelial line 16HBE14o− (Fig. 1C). In all cases, iNOS localized to the apical compartment (left-hand column, greenstaining). Cells were additionally stained for markers of epithelial polarity (middle column), which were E-cadherin (basolateral marker, Fig. 1B, panel 2, and C, panels 2 and 8) and β1-integrin (Fig. 1B, panel 5, and C, panel 5). On prolonged culture of polarized 16HBE14o− cells, some areas showed stacking of cells to two cells deep. In these areas, iNOS was also localized to the apical surface of the cells (Fig. 1C, panels 7–9). Given the limits of resolution of confocal microscopy (pixel size 0.172 μm), we were unable to conclude whether iNOS was directly associated with the plasma membrane in the apical compartment or was localized to an adjacent submembranous region. We therefore adopted a biochemical approach to explore further the association of iNOS with the plasma membrane. Biochemical analysis of lysates extracted from cytokine-treated PTEC (Fig.2A) demonstrated that iNOS is present in both cytosolic (HSS, Fig. 2A) and particulate (HSP, Fig. 2A) cell fractions. Digital densitometry showed that 29.33 ± 2.06% (n = 4) of total cellular iNOS was recovered from the HSP, a similar proportion to that found for the actin-associated protein EBP50 (data not shown). iNOS enzyme activity was present in both HSS (8.17 ± 0.28 pmol/mg min−1) and HSP (1.03 ± 0.05 pmol/mg min−1), with the latter representing 11.2% of total cellular iNOS activity. The percentage of iNOS in the particulate fraction assayed by immunoblotting is about half that determined by confocal microscopy; this may reflect some loss of iNOS from this compartment on cell lysis and centrifugation. The lower iNOS activity in the particulate fraction may reflect poor substrate availability. However, these data confirm that a significant proportion of total cell iNOS is compartmentalized and enzymatically active within a membrane-rich, particulate fraction. We further analyzed the characteristics of iNOS within the particulate fraction by resuspending the HSP in lysis buffer and then subjecting it to fractionation by sucrose equilibrium density centrifugation. iNOS sedimented in dense fractions (Fig. 2B, lanes 13–17), similar to the distribution of actin and the majority of the actin-associated membrane protein E-cadherin (lanes 8–17). iNOS was distinct from caveolin-1, a non-actin-associated plasma membrane protein and marker of caveolae (light fractions, Fig.2B, lanes 3–6). Membrane vesicles containing E-cadherin were also found in light fractions (Fig.2B, lanes 3 and 4) but were distinct from iNOS. This analysis of the material within the HSP shows that biochemical fractionation under these conditions does not provide a complete separation into distinct subcellular compartments. However, taken together, these data indicate that iNOS within the particulate fraction is not within a light lipid-rich structure but rather may be present in a large submembranous protein complex associated with the cortical cytoskeleton. To explore further the nature of this association, we extracted the HSP with a series of salt and detergent solutions (Fig.2C). We found that buffers containing high salt concentrations (up to 1.0 m KCl) were ineffective in extracting iNOS (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and3). Indeed, Na2CO3, a reagent that extracts many peripherally bound proteins (18Pestonjamasp K.N. Pope R.K. Wulfkuhle J.D. Luna E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1255-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), did not solubilize iNOS (Fig. 2C, lane 4). However, iNOS was completely extracted by 0.1 m NaOH (Fig. 2C, lane 5), confirming that it is not an integral membrane protein. The protein remained insoluble in the presence of non-ionic detergents (0.1 and 1% Triton X-100; Fig. 2C, lanes 6 and7, respectively), and 0.1% SDS (Fig. 2C, lane 9) but was entirely solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 + 250 mm salt (Fig. 2C, lane 8) and 1% SDS (Fig. 2C, lane 10). These data indicate a tight interaction with the particulate fraction although not as tight as for actin-binding proteins such as supervillin (18Pestonjamasp K.N. Pope R.K. Wulfkuhle J.D. Luna E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1255-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Given the striking apical localization of iNOS and the biochemical data suggesting that iNOS is associated with the cytoskeleton, we examined the relationship between iNOS and cortical actin. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that iNOS (Fig. 2, D and J) colocalized with cortical actin (Fig. 2, E and K) in polarized PTEC (yellow pixels in Fig. 2, F andL). Furthermore, iNOS was redistributed into the cytosol following actin disruption by cytochalasin D (Fig. 2, G–I), confirming that iNOS is associated with cortical actin either via a direct or indirect interaction. Given its potential COOH-terminal PDZ binding motif (SAL), we examined whether iNOS might localize to the apical domain via an interaction with EBP50. We tested this hypothesis using pull-down assays with GST fused to (i) the 10 COOH-terminal residues of iNOS (GST-iNOSwt) or (ii) a mutated COOH-terminal sequence (GST-iNOSmut) (Fig.3A). Following incubation of GST-iNOSwt with 16HBE14o− cell lysates, a 50-kDa band and two smaller bands (∼45 kDa) were detected in the precipitate as shown on the Coomassie-stained gel in Fig. 3B. These bands were not detected when 16HBE14o− lysates were incubated with GST only. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates showed that the 50-kDa band corresponded to human EBP50 (Fig. 3C). The two lower molecular weight bands were also recognized by the anti-EBP50 mAb, suggesting that they might represent EBP50 fragments. In contrast, EBP50 was not present in the precipitates of 16HBE14o− cell lysates incubated with GST-iNOSmut (Fig. 3C). Pull-down assays using PTEC lysates showed an identical specific interaction between EBP50 and GST-iNOSwt but no binding of EBP50 to GST-iNOSmut or GST alone (Fig. 3D). Thus, the COOH-terminal tail of human iNOS binds to EBP50, an interaction that is dependent on the three COOH-terminal amino acids, SAL. It is also possible that iNOS may interact with other members of the EBP50 family, such as E3KARP, which migrates with a similar mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. However, E3KARP has a different tissue distribution than EBP50 and is not found within the proximal tubule cells used in the above pull-down experiments (19Ingraffea J. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, iNOS and EBP50 colocalize within epithelial cells at the apical compartment of the cell. We attempted to demonstrate an interaction within cells by co-immunoprecipitating iNOS and EBP50 from epithelial cells. However, we were unable to do this either from cytokine-treated PTECs or iNOS-transfected cells. Expression of iNOS even in stably transfected cells was only found in about 10–20% of the cell population, and following the incubations required for immunoprecipitation, a significant amount of iNOS degraded to lower molecular weight peptides (data not shown). Both of these factors may limit the ability to detect iNOS/EBP50 interactions in a cellular context. Because the pull-down experiments were performed in whole lysates, they do not differentiate between a direct or indirect interaction of iNOS with EBP50. To address this problem directly, we purified full-length recombinant EBP50 expressed in human HEK293 cells. Using this material, we were unable to demonstrate a direct interaction between EBP50 and iNOS (Fig. 3E) despite a very sensitive Western blot assay system that could easily detect nanomole amounts of EBP50. This suggests that any interaction of iNOS and EBP50 must require the presence of additional proteins found in whole cell lysates, as used for the pull-down experiments (Fig. 3,A–D). Does the potential interaction of the COOH terminus of iNOS with the PDZ domain-containing protein EBP50 play a role in localizing iNOS to the apical domain? To test for this possibility directly, we constructed an expression vector for full-length iNOS bearing the COOH-terminal mutation from -MSAL to -MDGR that abolished the interaction with EBP50 as shown in the pull-down experiments. We constructed stable transfectants of MDCK cells with both wild type and COOH-terminal mutant constructs and examined the distribution of iNOS in each cell line. As shown before in Fig. 1, wild type iNOS localized to the apical compartment of MDCK cells. The COOH-terminal mutant, however, showed a different distribution with virtual abolition of its association with the apical compartment (Fig.4A). This distribution was significantly different from that seen with wild type iNOS (Fig.4B). Thus, the three COOH-terminal amino acids are essential for correct localization of iNOS in the apical compartment of epithelial cells. Taken together with the other data presented above, a plausible explanation for this would be an interaction of iNOS with EBP50 leading to its apical distribution and association with the cortical actin cytoskeleton. To determine whether iNOS delivers NO locally at the apical domain, we measured apical and basal NO output from cytokine-treated PTEC monolayers. Measurement of NO in these two compartments showed rapid NO release in the apical chamber with no significant output basally (Fig.5). Apical l-NIL-sensitive NO concentration reached 6.82 ± 0.9 μm in the period 12–18 h after cytokine addition, compared with the basal NO output of 0.09 ± 0.09 μm (P < 0.005,n = 4, Fig. 5). These data show that apical compartmentalization of iNOS results in vectorial NO release at the apical PTEC surface. We describe here the novel observation that iNOS in epithelia is localized to the apical compartment and directs synthesis of NO in a vectorial fashion at the apical epithelial surface. We demonstrate that iNOS is tightly associated with cortical actin and has a COOH-terminal PDZ-binding domain that can interact with the apical submembranous scaffold protein, EBP50. This domain is essential for the correct localization of iNOS to the apical compartment. These findings show that iNOS, in common with the other NOS isoforms, endothelial NOS (20Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neuronal NOS (21Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), is targeted to a specific cellular location, suggesting that subcellular compartmentalization of NO synthesis is important in limiting NO production to the region of the cell where required. Given the high reactivity of NO, it would be advantageous to the cell to locate the site of high concentration NO synthesis in close proximity to its site of action, limiting access to other cell compartments. This would maximize the efficiency of NO delivery to its targets such as apical transporters and reduce potential toxicity elsewhere in the cell. One interesting possibility is that NO may modulate the function of other proteins complexed with EBP50, such as the apical NHE3 or the c-yes-associated protein, YAP65. The imaging results show that iNOS is localized in close proximity to the apical membrane of both cytokine-treated and iNOS-transfected epithelial cells (Fig. 1). Because iNOS will only be produced in the human kidney following stimulus with pro-inflammatory cytokines, we have not been able to study the distribution of iNOS in vivo, as renal biopsy material is not collected from patients with, for example, severe sepsis in which iNOS might be expected to be induced. However, given the range of different epithelial cell types in which we observed this localization, we suggest that this is a general feature of iNOS within epithelia. Confocal imaging cannot differentiate the localization of iNOS either to within the plasma membrane or immediately subjacent to it. Biochemical analysis of the distribution of iNOS within epithelial cells (Fig. 2) shows that it is tightly bound to a particulate cell fraction with properties that suggest close association with the actin cytoskeleton. This is supported by the co-localization of iNOS and cortical actin that is disrupted by the actin depolymerizing agent, cytochalasin (Fig. 2,D–I). We found a similar association of iNOS and cortical actin within murine macrophages (22Webb J.L. Harvey M.W. Holden D.W. Evans T.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6391-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that a similar association occurs in these cells. We show that the COOH terminus of iNOS can mediate an interaction with the PDZ protein EBP50 (Fig. 3). This is an important molecule that has a number of different binding partners. Through its interaction with ezrin, it is anchored to the actin cytoskeleton (10Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In turn, it binds to the apical ion channel NHE3 (23Yun C.H., Oh, S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These interactions have important functional consequences, for example in modulating NHE3 activity (23Yun C.H., Oh, S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The structural basis for these interactions, in common with all PDZ-containing proteins, is though binding to the COOH-terminal three amino acids of the target protein. The COOH terminus of human iNOS is MSAL, which is a good consensus for interaction with the PDZ domains of EBP50 (the COOH-terminal sequences of all EBP50-interacting proteins are summarized in Ref. 31Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A similar COOH-terminal consensus sequence, ATRL, is also found in murine iNOS (35Xie Q.-W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Ding A. Troso T. Nathan C. Science. 1992; 256: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). This COOH-terminal sequence is essential for in vitrobinding of iNOS to EBP50 (Fig. 3) and for in vivo apical localization (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, isolated pure EBP50 was not able to bind to this sequence on its own (Fig. 3), suggesting that anyin vivo interaction requires additional stabilizing factors. One of these might be posttranslational modifications of the COOH terminus of iNOS modulating binding to PDZ domains, as has been shown for the COOH terminus of the β2 adrenergic receptor (36Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and the tumor suppressor PTEN (24Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition, the possibility for interactions between multiprotein complexes held together by EBP50 is very great, and the relative affinity of these interactions may depend on the presence of other proteins bound within the complex. The requirement for the three COOH-terminal amino acids of iNOS for efficient apical localization to the apical domain suggests that the interaction of iNOS with EBP50 is important in vivo. A number of mechanisms might account for this polarized distribution depending on the iNOS PDZ-binding domain. First, iNOS may be sorted to both apical and basolateral destinations but is retained in the apical compartment by binding to EBP50. Second, the COOH-terminal domain may interact with a PDZ protein within the Golgi, to facilitate anterograde transport to the apical compartment. This might be EBP50, or possibly another PDZ domain-containing protein such as CAL, which is localized within the Golgi and has been shown to bind to CFTR and modulate its surface expression. Third, the COOH-terminal PDZ-interacting domain may itself be a sorting determinant to direct iNOS to the apical compartment. It is difficult to distinguish between these possibilities. We have observed that in subconfluent cells, iNOS is localized within an uncharacterized vesicle population within the cytoplasm. In some cells this is concentrated into the Golgi region, 2P. A. Glynne and T. J. Evans, unpublished observations. suggesting that traffic through the Golgi could determine subcellular localization of iNOS. However, mutation of the three terminal amino acids of iNOS do not seem to alter the localization of iNOS within this vesicle population, although the precise effects on Golgi localization have not been determined. Intriguingly, wild type iNOS is also localized to the tips of long filopodia in subconfluent cytokine-treated human PTECs.2 The exact molecular mechanism involved in the apical targeting of iNOS within epithelial cells remains unknown, other than the fact that it is dependent on the COOH-terminal three amino acids of iNOS. In conclusion, we have shown that human epithelial iNOS localizes to the apical domain of polarized cells, tightly bound to cortical actin. Further, we show that iNOS binds to the apical PDZ protein EBP50 via its three COOH-terminal amino acids, SAL. Apical localization of iNOS within cells requires the three COOH-terminal amino acids, showing the importance of this interaction in vivo. iNOS directs vectorial NO production at the apical cell surface. This work has important implications for the identification of novel roles for NO in the regulation of apical epithelial cell functions. The precise nature of the iNOS-EBP50 interaction and its importance for correct iNOS localization and function within the apical compartment of polarized epithelial cells are yet to be elucidated and will be the subject of future studies."

The RR spectra of both the reduced and oxidized WT enzyme were characteristic of six-coordinate low spin heme complexes from pH 4 to 10. The time-resolved RR spectra of the photodissociated CO-WT complex had an iron-His stretching band (νFe-His) at 214 cm−1, and the νFe-COversus νCO plot of CO-WT E. coli DOS PAS fell on the line of His-coordinated heme proteins. The photodissociated CO-H77A mutant complex did not yield the νFe-His band but gave a νFe-Im band in the presence of imidazole. The RR spectrum of the oxidized M95A mutant was that of a six-coordinate low spin complex (i.e. the same as that of the WT enzyme), whereas the reduced mutant appeared to contain a five-coordinate heme complex. Taken together, we suggest that the heme of the reduced WT enzyme is coordinated by His77 and Met95, and that Met95 is displaced by CO and O2. Presumably, the protein conformational change that occurs upon exchange of an unknown ligand for Met95 following heme reduction may lead to activation of the phosphodiesterase domain of E. coli DOS.

In each case, binding of an external ligand to the heme located in an N-terminal sensory domain transmits a signal to the functional C-terminal domain (either enzymatic or DNA binding). We are curious to know how these proteins recognize a specific diatomic molecule to generate the appropriate physiological response and what kind of structural changes occur to transmit the signal from the sensory domain to the functional domain. The sensory domain of FixL belongs to the large family of signal-transducing PAS domain 1PAS is an acronym formed from the names of the proteins in which imperfect repeat sequences were first recognized: theDrosophila period clock protein (PER), vertebrate aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), andDrosophila single-minded protein (SIM). 1PAS is an acronym formed from the names of the proteins in which imperfect repeat sequences were first recognized: theDrosophila period clock protein (PER), vertebrate aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), andDrosophila single-minded protein (SIM). proteins, whereas those of HemAT, CooA, and soluble guanylate cyclase do not. The PAS domain proteins found in eukarya, archaea, and bacteria contain a partly conserved tertiary structure despite their limited sequence homology (<15%) and dissimilar cofactors (13Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although structures of three PAS proteins including the human voltage sensor (HERG) (14Morais-Cabral J.H.

Namely, hydrophobic interactions seem important to regulate the K+channel of HERG, whereas polar interactions in the EF loop of the PAS domain seem to be essential to PYP. In the case of FixL, either a protein conformational change associated with the location of the heme iron (in-plane/out-of-plane) (15Gong W. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G.

Biol. 2000; 301: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) appears to play a substantial role in regulating the activity of the functional domain. E. coli DOS was found in E. coli by the Gilles-Gonzalez group who predicted, on the basis of sequence homology to the PAS domain of FixL, that it is an O2 sensor enzyme (8Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzales G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The same group later found an O2-sensitive phosphodiesterase (PDE A1)2in Acetobacter xylinum (designated AxPDEA1) (7Chang A.L. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Volman G. Amikan D. Benziman M. Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3420-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 140 residues of AxPDEA1 contain the heme binding PAS motif, whereas PDE activity is present in the C-terminal region. Importantly, the E. coli DOS protein is highly homologous (50%) to the C-terminal region of AxPDEA1. In our previous paper, we found thatE. coli DOS is a PDE and that the activity is sensitive to the heme redox state rather than O2 binding (18Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The study demonstrated that the enzyme is inhibited by oxidation of the heme iron and on the binding of external ligands such as CO and NO. Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for elucidating the structural characteristics of heme domains, by providing detailed information about the coordination structure of the heme and the protein environment of the bound ligand (19Spiro T.G. Li X-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar, 20Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 39-95Google Scholar). Tomita et al. (22Tomita T. Gonzalez G. Chang A.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) recently reported comparative RR analysis of various heme-bound PAS domains including FixL, AxPDEA1, and E. coliDOS. They found unusual characteristics in the heme environment ofE. coli DOS compared with other PAS domains. In the present paper, we examine visible stationary and time-resolved resonance Raman spectra of the wild type form of the isolated heme-bound PAS domain ofE. coli DOS (E. coli DOS PAS) (WT) and the His77 and Met95 mutants in order to further elucidate the structure-function relationships of the heme domain. From the RR data, it appears that, in the ferrous complexes, one of the axial ligands to E. coli DOS PAS is His77 and the other is Met95. Cloning of E. coli DOS, construction of the expression plasmids and purification of the wild type and mutant proteins was performed essentially as described in our previous paper (18Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The His77 mutant proteins were expressed and purified in the presence of imidazole (10 mm). The purities ofE. coli DOS PAS samples were confirmed to be more than 95% homogenous by SDS-PAGE. For Raman experiments, E. coli DOS PAS was further purified by gel filtration through Sephadex G75 (16 × 60 cm) preequilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer. Finally, the purified protein was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of protein was adjusted to 50–70 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.7. Reduced E. coli DOS PAS was prepared by adding a minimum amount of sodium dithionite solution (final concentration, 1–2 mm) into the protein solution under nitrogen atmosphere. The CO adduct of E. coli DOS PAS (CO-E. coli DOS PAS) was prepared by incubating the dithionite-reduced E. coli DOS PAS with CO-saturated buffer. The O2 adduct of E. coli DOS PAS (O2-E. coli DOS PAS) was obtained by incubating the dithiothreitol (10 mm)-reduced E. coli DOS PAS with O2-saturated buffer. The oxidized E. coli DOS PAS was prepared by adding potassium ferricyanide to the purified protein. Formation of ligand-bound and oxidized forms and the integrity of the sample after Raman measurements were confirmed by measuring the optical absorption spectrum. Continuous wave Raman scattering was performed by exciting at 421 nm with a blue diode laser (Hitachi Metals, model ICD-430), at 413 nm with a Kr+ ion laser (Spectra Physics, model 2016) or 441.6 nm with a helium/cadmium laser (Kinmonn Electric, model CD4805R). The excitation light was focused on the sample contained in a variable speed spinning cell. The laser power at the sample point was typically 3–4 mW but was made 0.1–0.2 mW for CO-E. coli DOS PAS to minimize photodissociation of bound CO. The scattered light along a right angle from the incident radiation was dispersed by a 100-cm single polychromator (Ritsu Oyo Kogaku, model DG-1000) equipped with a cooled CCD detector (Princeton Instruments, model CCD-1100). Raman shifts were calibrated using indene, carbontetrachloride, dimethylformamide, and cyclohexane. The accuracy of frequencies are ±1 cm−1 for well defined peaks. Picosecond time-resolved resonance Raman (TR3) spectra were measured using a homemade pump/probe system, details of which have been described elsewhere (23Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Science. 1997; 278: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Uesugi Y. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1997; 68: 4001-4008Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, the probe beam at 442 nm (0.2 μJ/pulse) was the first Stokes stimulated Raman line of methane gas derived from a homemade Raman shifter, whereas the pump beam at 540 nm (12 μJ/pulse) was generated by optical parametric generation and amplification. Both pulses were obtained from the second harmonic of the 784-nm output of a Ti-sapphire laser operated at 1 kHz. Raman scattered light was detected with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Princeton Instruments, model CCD-1100PB), which was attached to a single spectrograph (Chromex, model 500IM-CM). Nanosecond TR3 spectra were measured with a single-color arrangement using 10-ns pulses at 427 nm (∼0.3 mJ/pulse at a sample) operated at 100 Hz. The light pulse was obtained from an XeCl excimer laser-pumped dye laser (Lambda Physik, model EMG 103MC/FL2002). In this experiment, the 308-nm output of the XeCl laser was converted to 427 nm with stilbene 420. The Raman scattered light was detected with the same detection system as used for continuous wave RR experiments. Fig. 1 shows the unpolarized RR spectra of reduced (a) and oxidized (b) E. coli DOS PAS excited at 421 nm in the 180–620 cm−1region (A) and the parallel and perpendicular components of the spectra in the 1300–1700 cm−1 region (B). The bands of the reduced form at 1361, 1493, 1580, and 1609 cm−1 are assigned to ν4, ν3,ν2, and ν10 of porphyrin in-plane vibrations, respectively (19Spiro T.G. Li X-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar). The ν4, ν3, and ν2 band positions are the same as those previously reported (22Tomita T. Gonzalez G. Chang A.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas the ν10 band was located at 1625 cm−1 in Tomita et al. (22Tomita T. Gonzalez G. Chang A.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ν4, ν3, and ν10 bands, which are used as the oxidation and coordination/spin state markers, have frequencies similar to those of cytochrome b5(25Kitagawa T. Kyogoku Y. Iizuka T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yamanaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and CooA (26Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), indicating that E. coli DOS PAS adopts a six-coordinate low spin (6c-ls) state. The ν4,ν3, ν2 and ν10 bands of the oxidized form are observed at 1372, 1505, 1577, and 1641 cm−1, respectively, similar positions to those previously reported by Tomita et al. (22Tomita T. Gonzalez G. Chang A.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and typical 6c-ls type. The Raman bands assignable to the vinyl side chains of the heme are seen at 1620, 1433, and 412 cm−1 for the oxidized form, similar to those of the reduced form at 1620, 1432, and 410 cm−1. This indicates that the structure of the vinyl side chains is similar in the oxidized and reduced forms. Although these spectra were observed for E. coli DOS PAS at pH 7.7, RR spectra were hardly changed between pH 4.4 and 10.0. This means that the heme coordination is not altered in this pH range. Fig. 2 compares the RR spectra of CO-E. coli DOS PAS (b) and O2-E. coli DOS PAS (c) excited at 421 nm with those of reduced (a) and oxidized (d) forms excited at the same wavelength. The ν4,ν3, and ν2 bands of CO-E. coliDOS PAS are identified at 1370, 1496, and 1581 cm−1, which are distinctly different from those of reduced E. coli DOS PAS but are close to those of general CO-bound 6c-ls hemes (28Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ν4, ν3, ν2, and ν10 bands of O2-E. coli DOS PAS are observed at 1375, 1505, 1580, and 1640 cm−1, which are rather close to those of the oxidized form but also close to those of oxy-R. melilori FixL (ν4 = 1376, ν3 = 1502, ν2 = 1577, and ν10= 1636 cm−1) (29Tamura K. Nakamura H. Tanaka Y. Tsukamoto K. Nomura M. Tsuchiya T. Adachi S. Takahashi S. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9434-9435Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The bands in this region of the CO- and O2-E. coli DOS PAS spectra have not been reported previously. To confirm that the RR spectra of the lower frequency region arise from the ligand bound forms, their dependences on isotopically labeled ligands were examined. Fig. 3 shows the RR spectra of 16O2-E. coli DOS PAS (a) and 18O2-E. coli DOS PAS (b) and their difference (c) (a − b). It is apparent from the isotope difference spectrum that the ∼559 cm−1 band of16O2-E. coli DOS PAS is shifted to ∼540 cm−1 in 18O2-E. coli DOS PAS. Simulation of the difference spectrum with Gaussian band shape functions enabled us to determine the precise band positions in the raw spectra, which were 561 cm−1 for16O2-E. coli DOS PAS and 538 cm−1 for 18O2-E. coliDOS PAS. The isotopic frequency shift of 23 cm−1 is close to that expected for a diatomic oscillator like Fe-O2 (21 cm−1); the 561 cm−1 band can therefore be assigned to the Fe-O2 stretching mode. Thus, it is confirmed that spectrum c in Fig. 2 arises from O2-E. coli DOS PAS, despite its similarity to the spectrum of the oxidized form (d). Similar RR data was also obtained by Tomita et al. for the O2-E. coli DOS PAS complex (22Tomita T. Gonzalez G. Chang A.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The CO-isotope dependence of the CO-E. coli DOS PAS RR spectra is illustrated in Fig. 4, wherespectra a and b in panel A represent the spectra of12C16O-E. coli DOS PAS and13C18O-E. coli DOS PAS in the 300–800 cm−1 region, respectively; spectra d and e in panel Brepresent the spectra of 12C16O-E. coli DOS PAS and 13C16O-E. coliDOS PAS in the 1500–2050 cm−1 region, respectively; andspectra c and f display the isotope difference spectra (c = a −b, and f = d −e). It is obvious from the difference spectra that the 486 and 1973 cm−1 bands of 12C16O-E. coli DOS PAS are shifted to 472 and 1927 cm−1 after isotopic labeling. Accordingly, the former and latter are assigned to the Fe-CO stretching (νFe-CO) and C-O stretching (νCO) modes, respectively. These isotope-dependent spectral changes were not obtained by Tomita et al. (22Tomita T. Gonzalez G. Chang A.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The RR spectra of CO-E. coliDOS PAS did not change with pH over the range 4.4–10.0. Usually, CO bound to histidine-coordinated heme is photodissociable, resulting in five-coordinate high spin (5c-hs) heme. To see this state, the laser power was increased during the continuous wave Raman experiments with CO-E. coli DOS PAS. This resulted in a frequency shift of ν4 from 1370 to 1361 cm−1(results not shown). Nevertheless, the iron-histidine stretching band, which is observable in the 200–250 cm−1 region only for the ferrous 5c-hs form (20Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 97-131Google Scholar), was not observed. Furthermore, the ν3 band was observed at 1493 cm−1, similar to that in spectrum a in Fig. 2. This means that the heme is still ferrous 6c-ls but has formed a different complex. In other words, the CO has photodissociated, but an endogenous ligand has bound rapidly in its place. The transit time for a molecule to go across the laser beam under the particular cell spinning conditions used is estimated to be a few hundred microseconds; coordination of an internal residue to the axial site of heme must therefore be completed in the nanosecond time range. This was investigated by collecting TR3 spectra for CO-E. coli DOS PAS. The results from picosecond TR3 experiments on CO-E. coli DOS PAS are displayed in Fig.5, where A and Brepresent the TR3 spectra in the low (150–800 cm−1) and high frequency (1250–1650 cm−1) regions, respectively, and spectra a–dcorrespond to the pump/probe results with time delays of −5, 1, 10, and 1000 ps. Spectra e in both panels show the spectrum obtained with the probe beam only and therefore reflect CO- E. coli DOS PAS before photolysis. This spectrum agrees with spectrum bin Fig. 2, demonstrating that the probe beam is weak enough to protect the sample from photolysis. Since about 30% of the CO is photolyzed under these conditions, the observed spectrum contains a contribution from the unphotolyzed species. This contribution was subtracted from the observed spectra by the use of spectrum e. Accordingly, spectra a–d reflect the transient species only. Spectra a in both panelsexhibit no band features, indicating that the sample is completely restored to CO-E. coli DOS PAS in one turn of the spinning cell and gives rise to the same spectrum as that observed without the pump light. After 1 ps (b), the ν4 band is shifted to 1354 cm−1, the same frequency as observed for deoxy-Mb with histidine-coordinated 5c-hs heme. The spectral pattern of spectrum b in Fig. 5B is distinctly different from that shown in Fig. 2, spectrum a, but close to that observed for photolyzed MbCO (30Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. 2002; 105: 10992-10999Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the lower frequency region, two bands appeared at 214 and 298 cm−1, which were absent in the spectrum of the reduced form. The two bands can be assigned to the iron-histidine stretching (νFe-His) and γ7 modes of the ferrous 5c-hs heme, respectively. The intensities of the two bands increased after 10 ps and did not decrease even after 1000 ps. This means that the equilibrium structure of the 5c-hs heme is attained in a short time and that photolyzed CO leaves the heme pocket, unlike in the case of CO-CooA (31Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the picosecond TR3 experiment has established that the transligand to CO is histidyl imidazole and that the coordination of an internal ligand to the sixth coordination position is not as fast as in the case of CooA. Similar TR3experiments were carried out with O2-E. coli DOS PAS, but the ν4 band was observed at the same frequency as in Fig. 2c, indicating that no photodissociation of O2 occurs. It has been suggested from amino acid sequence alignment and mutation experiments (8Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzales G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T.

Therefore, we examined the RR spectra of the Ala and His mutants of these residues. Fig.6 shows the 421-nm excited RR spectra in the 1300–1700 cm−1 region of M95H in the reduced state (a), and of M95A in the reduced (b) and oxidized (c) states. Spectrum a is of a typical ferrous 6c-ls type, suggesting the formation of bishistidine-coordinated heme. The addition of CO yielded the νFe-CO and νCO bands at 489 and 1965 cm−1, respectively (spectra not shown).Spectrum b is definitely different fromspectrum a in Fig. 2 as well as from the spectrum of oxidized M95H. The ν2, ν3, and ν4 bands are observed at 1558, 1468, and 1353 cm−1, indicating the presence of the ferrous 5c-hs heme. The RR spectrum in the lower frequency region, which was obtained with excitation at 441.6 nm, is displayed in the inset of Fig. 6. Here, a band assignable to the νFe-His mode (20Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 97-131Google Scholar) is observed at 213 cm−1. Since E. coli DOS PAS has two His residues (His77 and His83), it is highly likely that a His-coordinated 5c-hs heme complex is formed in the reduced form of M95A. The addition of CO to it yielded the νFe-CO and νCO bands at 487 and 1966 cm−1, respectively, which are fairly close to those for M95H. Unexpectedly, the spectrum of the oxidized form of M95A (c) is very close to spectrum d in Fig. 2, indicating the presence of 6c-ls heme (i.e. similar to the WT form). It suggests the coordination of a residue other than Met to the sixth site of the heme ferric complex. We have examined the pH dependence of the RR spectrum of the mutant but noticed no pH-induced spectral changes between pH 6 and 10. As described in our previous paper, mutation of His77destabilized heme binding, whereas mutation of His83 did not (18Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The H77A mutant expressed and prepared in the presence of imidazole (Im), however, did bind heme and retained it even after the removal of Im by gel filtration chromatography like the corresponding Mb mutant (32Barrick D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We measured RR spectra of the H77A mutant prepared like this, both in the absence and presence of exogenous Im, in which the concentration of Im is adjusted to 500 equivalents of the protein. Fig.7 shows the 421-nm excited RR spectra of the reduced form of the H77A mutant in the presence (a) and absence (b) of exogenous Im. In the absence of Im, two ν3 bands are observed at 1468 and 1492 cm−1with nearly equal intensity, indicating the coexistence of the 5c-hs and 6c-ls heme complexes. The addition of a 500-fold excess of Im to the protein solution resulted in weakening of the 5c-hs marker band at 1468 cm−1 and concomitant intensification of the 6c-ls marker band at 1492 cm−1. This indicates that an alternative residue is coordinated to the heme iron in the absence of exogenous Im. To identify it, we examined its CO adduct. The 421-nm excited RR spectra of the CO adduct of H77A in the absence (a) and presence (b and c) of exogenous Im are shown in Fig. 8, whereA and B display the 250–600 and 1800–2100 cm−1 regions of the spectra, respectively. In bothA and B, spectra a andb were obtained with 12C16O,spectra c were obtained with13C18O, and spectra dshow the 12C16O minus13C18O difference spectra. It is obvious from the difference spectra that the νFe-CO and νCO bands for 12C16O appear at 488 and 1973 cm−1, respectively, in the presence of exogenous Im and are shifted to 477 and 1881 cm−1, respectively, with 13C18O. It was found that the νFe-CO and νCO frequencies of the H77A mutant in the presence of exogenous Im are the same as those of the WT enzyme (486 and 1973 cm−1; Fig. 4). This means that the environments around the CO are likely to be similar, because both frequencies are sensitive to residues surrounding the bound CO (33Phillips G.N. J Teodoro M.L., Li, T. Smith B. Olson J.S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 8817-8829Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It appears that exogenous Im is bound instead of His77 and that CO occupies the same site as in the WT protein. In the absence of exogenous Im, on the other hand, the νFe-CO and νCO band"

We have focused on two regions encompassing 50 kilobases suspected to contain new regulatory elements based on our previous high level expression results with yeast artificial chromosome-based mouse Igκ transgenes. This approach has revealed a cluster of HSs within the 18-kilobase intervening sequence, which we cloned and sequenced in its entirety, between the Vκ gene closest to the Jκ region. These HSs exhibit pro/pre-B cell-specific transcriptional silencing of a Vκ gene promoter in transient transfection assays. We also identified a plasmacytoma cell-specific HS in the far downstream region of the locus, which in analogous transient transfection assays proved to be a powerful transcriptional enhancer. Deletional analyses reveal that for each element multiple DNA segments cooperate to achieve either silencing or enhancement. The enhancer sequence is conserved in the human Igκ gene locus, including NF-κB and E-box sites that are important for the activity. In summary, our results pinpoint the locations of presumptive regulatory elements for future knockout studies to define their functional roles in the native locus.

In some instances targeted deletions of these elements have been performed in cell lines or mice, permitting their functional significance to be addressed in the native locus. Deletion of a germ line promoter or KI-KII sequences or both results in a suppressed recombination phenotype (35Ferradini L., Gu, H. Smet A.D. Rajewsky K. Reynaud C.A. Weill J.C.

Trevorrow K.W. Claffin L. Garrard W.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6029-6039PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of either Ei or E3′ severely reduces but does not abolish Igκ gene rearrangement (44Xu Y.

Alt F.W. Baltimore D. Xu Y. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although considerable insight has been revealed on the functional significance of the above elements, the results of several investigations strongly suggest that additional crucial regulatory elements within the Igκ locus remain to be discovered. For example, expression of rearranged Igκ transgenes containing both enhancers is influenced by the site integration and fails to exhibit copy-number dependence (16Blasquez V.C.

Transgenics. 1998; 2: 333-343Google Scholar). However, our recent success of achieving high level expression of YAC-based mouse Igκ transgenes indicates that regulatory elements are present in these constructs capable of conferring copy number-dependent, position-independent germ line transcription, tissue and developmental stage-specific efficient Vκ-Jκ rearrangement, and rearranged Igκ gene transcription (54Li S. Hammer R.E. George-Raizen J.B. Meyers K.C. Garrard W.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These constructs contained additional upstream and downstream sequences missing from other poorly expressed transgenes, sequences residing both 5′ and 3′ of the Jκ-Cκ region. In an effort to identify new regulatory elements we have therefore focused on the aforementioned previously unstudied regions in the mouse Igκ locus suspected to possess transcriptional regulatory elements based on our transgenic mice studies (54Li S. Hammer R.E. George-Raizen J.B. Meyers K.C. Garrard W.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our approach takes advantage of the observation that when cis-acting elements are functional in a particular cell lineage, they often form nuclease hypersensitive sites (HSs) in chromatin (55Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 157-197Crossref Scopus (953) Google Scholar). We report here the identification, sequencing, and initial functional characterization of several such HSs. Interestingly, one cluster of HSs specifies transcriptional silencing in pro/pre-B cells, whereas another acts as a powerful B cell-specific transcriptional enhancer.

To truncate FAW.A3, a genomic Vκ21 fragment was amplified by PCR (primers Vκ21L (5′-TGC TGC TGC TCT GGG TTC CAG GTG-3′) and Vκcdr2r (5′-GAT TCT AGG TTG GAT GCA GGA TAG-3′)). Amplification conditions were 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. The amplified sequence was introduced into the acentric fragmentation vector pBP81 (56Reeves R.H. Pavan W.J. Hieter P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 584-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), linearized, and transformed into yeast harboring FAW.A3 using standard lithium acetate transformation (57Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 53: 163-168Crossref Google Scholar). Several transformants were analyzed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Long PCR was performed using the Expand Long PCR System according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After equilibration in 1× PCR reaction buffer (excluding enzymes), 25 μl of master mix 1 (dNTPs plus primer) was added to gel block slices followed by incubation for 15 min at 65 °C and the subsequent addition of 25 μl of master mix 2 (including enzymes). Amplification conditions were 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 12 min. Twenty additional cycles were performed in which the extension cycle was increased by 10 s/cycle. Primers were Vκ21L (5′-TGC TGC TGC TCT GGG TTC CAG GTG-3′) and Jκ2R (5′-TTT GAG CTT GAG TAG ACA AAT ATC C-3′). 1–2% of the total products were separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels using an auto algorithm for 5–50 kb on a CHEF mapper (Bio-Rad). Cell lines, except for S194, A20, and MPC-11, were maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. β-Mercaptoethanol (50 μm) was added to pre-B cell cultures. S194 and A20 cells were cultured in Iscove’s medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, and MPC-11 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 20% horse serum. The engineered 103/BclII cell lines ΔN1 and ΔN7 (58Scherrer D.C. Brockman J.A. Bendall H.H. Zhang G.M. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 563-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were kind gifts of Eugene Oltz (Vanderbilt University). The pre-B cell 103Bcl2 lines were maintained at 34 °C with 5% CO2; S194, A20, and MPC-11cells were maintained at 37 °C and 10% CO2; all other lines were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were permeabilized with hen egg white α-lysolecithin (Sigma) and treated with increasing concentrations of DNase I (Worthington Biochemicals) (0.25–8.0 units/ml) (17Roque M.A. Smith P.A. Blasquez V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3138-3155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After lysis, DNA was purified either using Qiagen genomic columns or by phenol:chloroform extraction (13Hale M.A. Garrard W.T. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and samples were digested to completion with either BglII,HindIII, NcoI, or PstI as indicated below. For PstI digest mapping with probes A or B (see Fig.1), 10–15-μg samples were electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose (SeaKem GTG, FMC Bioproducts) in 0.5× Tris-acetate-buffered EDTA running buffer overnight at 1.1 V/cm. After blotting using standard neutral transfer to Nytran Plus membranes (59Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.38-9.40Google Scholar), 0.2-μm pore size (Schleicher and Schuell), prehybridized filters were hybridized overnight in 6× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate), 10× Denhardt’s solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml herring testes DNA with a 1.8- or 0.8-kb DNA fragments, corresponding to probes A and B, respectively, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Rediprime II (AP Biotech). Wash conditions were 1× SSC, 0.5% SDS 3 times for 30 min at 65 °C or until sufficient background had been eliminated. For mapping with probes C-E, electrophoresis and blotting was as above, but pre-hybridization, hybridization, and washing were performed according to a modification of Church and Gilbert (13Hale M.A. Garrard W.T. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 60Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). Membranes were exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. XAR5 film with intensifying screens at −70 °C or to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics). Probe A was a 1.8-kb ClaI/PstI fragment gel-isolated from the IS long PCR product. Primers for probe B PCR amplification were 5′-PstL (5′-TAA AAA TCC TGG TGC CAG GGG TG-3′) and 5′-PstR (5′-AGC TTA AGG ACG TCA CAT AGA CT-3′). PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C.BglII or NcoI digests were used for mapping with probe C, PstI digests were used for mapping with probe D, and HindIII digests were used for mapping with probe E (see Fig. 1). Probe C consisted of a 1.3-kbBglII/HindIII fragment isolated from the pRxR-1 recombinant plasmid (61Mu¨ller B. Stappert H. Reth M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1409-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Probe D consisted of a 1.5-kb SacI fragment isolated from the pRSB recombinant plasmid (61Mu¨ller B. Stappert H. Reth M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1409-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). pRxR-1 and pRSB were the kind gifts of Michael Reth (Max-Plank-Institut fu¨r Immunobiologie, Freiburg, Germany). Probe E was a 510-bp fragment spanning exon 6 of the mouse ribose-5-phosphate isomerase gene (62Apel T.W. Scherer A. Adachi T. Auch D. Ayane M. Reth M. Gene. 1995; 156: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), prepared as above using the following PCR primers 5′-GCT TGC TTG GAC CTG CTG G-3′ and 5′-CGG CAG AGA AGA CAA AGG ATC C-3′. For functional tests, various fragments were inserted into the NheI or theSpeI site of the polylinker region of KpLUC or IM.KpLUC, respectively (63Fulton R. Van Ness B.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4941-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), designated here as PVκLuc and EiPVκLuc, respectively. A 3.6-kb fragment encompassing hypersensitive sites HS 3–6 was amplified from the IS long PCR product to add externalSpeI sites using PCR conditions similar to those described above for probe preparation. The primer pairs for fragments containing HS 3–6, HS 4–6, HS 5–6, HS 6, HS 3–4, HS 3, and HS 4–5 were, respectively: 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTG TAC TCT GAA CCT TGT ATG GTG ATG-3′ and 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTG CAG GTT ATG GGC CCT CTT CC-3′; 5′-ACT CGT CGA CTA GTC TCT GGG CCT GCA CAG ATT CCA C-3′ and 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTG CAG GTT ATG GGC CCT CTT CC-3′; 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTC TGC TAC ATA TGT GCG GGG GAG G-3′ and 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTG CAG GTT ATG GGC CCT CTT CC-3′; 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTC CCA CCC TCA AGA CAG GCA CAG-3′ and 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTG CAG GTT ATG GGC CCT CTT CC-3′; 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTG TAC TCT GAA CCT TGT ATG GTG ATG-3′ and 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTC CTC CCC CGC ACA TAT GTA GCA G-3′; 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTG TAC TCT GAA CCT TGT ATG GTG ATG-3′ and 5′-ACG CGT CGA CTA GTG GAA TCT GTG CAG GCC CAG AGA C-3′; 5′-ACG CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT CTC TGG GCC TGC ACA GAT TCC AC-3′ and 5′-ACG CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT GCC TGT CTT GAG GGT GGG ACT G-3′. The spacer DNA control was a 2.1-kb rat amylase cDNA fragment. PCR conditions were 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. For vector insertions we similarly amplified a 1-kb fragment encompassing HS 9 from recombinant plasmid pRxB5 (the kind gift of Michael Reth, Max-Plank-Institut fu¨r Immunobiologie, Freiburg, Germany) (61Mu¨ller B. Stappert H. Reth M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1409-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using the PCR primers L10F1 (5′-CCG CCG ACT AGT CGT TAG CCC CTG TCC TTG-3′) and L10R1 (5′-CCG CCG ACT AGT TGT GCA TAT GTG TGT GTA CAC ATG-3′). For testing smaller segments of the 1-kb sequences, we PCR-amplified the desired regions, again adding externalSpeI sites for vector insertions as above using the primers L10F2 (5′-CCG CCG ATC AGT GAA GCC AGG GAA ATG CCA C-3′), L10R2 (5′-CCG CCG ATC AGT CTA GCT TTA CAG CTT GTC-3′), L10R3 (5′-CCG CCG ATC AGT GCT TAA GCA GCA GAC AGT G-3′), L10R4 (5′-CCG CCG ATC AGT GTG CCC TGC ACC TTC AGG-3′), and L10R5 (5′-CCG CCG ATC AGT GTG GCA TTT CCC TGG CTT C-3′). PCR conditions were 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 75 s at 72 °C for 35 cycles. Finally, to replace the Vκ promoter with a 420-bp BglII/HindIII fragment containing the SV40 early enhancer/promoter from the pRL-SV40 vector (Promega), the Vκ promoter was deleted from PVκLuc by excision withNheI and HindIII and from PVκLuc containing the 3.6-kb silencer by HindIII digestion. Then the sticky ends of these two vectors were filled in with Klenow and dephosphorylated. The sticky ends of the SV40 early enhancer/promoter 420-bp fragment were also filled in with Klenow and ligated to the treated vectors to construct PSV40Luc and 3.6kbPSV40Luc. Cell lines were transiently transfected either in triplicate in the same batch or in duplicate in separate batches using either optimized DEAE dextran concentrations (100–250 μg/ml; 500 μg/ml for S194 cells) as previously described (58Scherrer D.C. Brockman J.A. Bendall H.H. Zhang G.M. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 563-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), LipofectAMINE-Plus, or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Typically, 106–107 cells and 1–2 μg of DNA were used per transfection, adjusted for insert sizes to provide equimolar comparisons, along with 20–50 ng of pRL-CMVRenilla luciferase reporter (Promega Corp). Pre-B and more mature cell lines were harvested 24 and 48 h post-transfection, respectively. The 24-h time chosen for pre-B cells allowed for optimum reproducibility of ±10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) comparisons (data not shown). Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay systems (Promega) following the manufacturers’ instructions. The Renilla luciferase activity was used for normalization of transfection efficiencies, except for the pre-B cell samples in Fig. 5, A andB, where extract protein levels were used. Data from a minimum of triplicate experiments are represented with error bars, whereas duplicate experiments are represented as means. Data were internally consistent between triplicates with the same batch of cells. Two-step PCR mutagenesis was used to create mutations of NFκB and E-box sites as described elsewhere (64Schanke J.T. Van Ness B.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4565-4572PubMed Google Scholar) in a 600-bp fragment amplified with L10F1 and L10R3 primers as described above. Sense and antisense primers for NFκB site mutation were 5′-GAA GTC AAA TTG GTT TCC ACT GTG CCA C-3′ and 5′-GAA ACC AAT TTG ACT TCA TTA CCT CAT G-3′; sense and antisense primers for first E-box mutation were 5′-CCT GCATTT TTG CAG TGC AGA TGG AC-3′ and 5′-CAC TGC AAA AAT GCA GGG CTG GAC TC-3′; sense and antisense primers for second E-box mutation were 5′-CAG TGC ATT TTG ACT TGG CAA AAG AAG-3′ and 5′-CAA GTCAAA ATG CAC TGC ACA GGT G-3′ (mutated bases are underlined). To locate new candidate regulatory elements within the mouse Igκ gene locus, we assayed for the presence of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the chromatin of B cell lines representing different stages of lymphocyte differentiation. Such an approach has been proven to be successful previously and has contributed to the discovery and functional analyses of several enhancer elements in the mouse light and heavy chain Ig gene loci (16Blasquez V.C.

https://openalex.org/W1986612218,"Heat shock stress induces some heat shock proteins, including Hsp70, and activates sodium-dependent glucose transport in porcine renal LLC-PK1 cells, but its mechanisms have not been described in detail. We investigated whether sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1) interacts with Hsp70 to increase SGLT1 activity. Heat shock stress increased SGLT1 activity without changing SGLT1 expression. The increase of SGLT1 activity was completely inhibited by an anti-transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) antibody. Instead of heat shock stress, TGF-β1 increased SGLT1 activity dose- and time-dependently without changing SGLT1 expression. We found that the amount of Hsp70 immunoprecipitated from TGF-β1-treated cells with an anti-SGLT1 antibody was higher than that of the control cells. Transfection of an anti-Hsp70 antibody into the cells inhibited the increase of SGLT1 activity. With confocal laser microscopy, both SGLT1 and Hsp70 was localized near the apical membrane in the TGF-β1-treated cells, and an anti-Hsp70 antibody disturbed this localization. Furthermore, we clarified that an anti-Hsp70 antibody inhibited interaction of SGLT1 with Hsp70 in vitro. These results suggest that Hsp70 forms a complex with SGLT1 and increases the expression level of SGLT1 in the apical membrane, resulting in up-regulation of glucose uptake.

In mammalian, glucose uptake across epithelial cells is mediated via two distinct glucose transporters: the Na+-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT),1 located in the apical membrane, and the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT), located in the basolateral membrane of kidney (1Hediger M.A. Rhoads D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 993-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The SGLT family includes three homologues: a high-affinity transporter, SGLT1, and low-affinity transporters SGLT2 and SGLT3. LLC-PK1cells derived from the porcine kidney are a useful model system for investigation of glucose transport because they selectively express SGLT1 and SGLT3 on the apical membrane the same as in vivo(2Mullin J.M. Weibel J. Diamond L. Kleinzeller A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 104: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus far, Rabito and Ausiello (3Rabito C.A. Ausiello D.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 54: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have reported that more than 85% of total Na+-dependent glucose uptake in LLC-PK1 cells is mediated via SGLT1. SGLT1 contains a number of potential protein kinase A and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (4Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The expression level of SGLT1 protein on plasma membrane was mainly regulated by these two kinases; protein kinase A increased the number of SGLT1 in the plasma membrane, whereas protein kinase C decreased it in SGLT1-expressedXenopus oocytes (5Hirsch J.R. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that protein kinase C lowered the turn-over rate in SGLT1-expressed COS-7 cells (6Vayro S. Silverman M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1053-C1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stabilization of SGLT1 in the plasma membrane is an important step toward increasing glucose uptake. Stress- or injury-induced protection and functional enhancement are often associated with increased synthesis and accumulation of heat shock proteins, particularly Hsp70 (for review, see Refs. 7Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar, 8Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 9Beck F.-X. Neuhofer W. Muller E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F203-F215PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp70 has a role in preventing the aggregation and misfolding of proteins. However, it plays an essential role under normal condition, including assisting in the folding of newly synthesized proteins, translocating proteins to the appropriate organs, and dissociating protein aggregates. In addition, Hsp70 interacts with specific native proteins expressed on plasma membrane, such as A1 adenosine receptor (10Sarrio S. Casado V. Escriche M. Ciruela F. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5164-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Na+/H+-exchanger (11Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10412-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and Na+,K+-ATPase (12Bidmon B. Endemann M. Muller T. Arbeiter K. Herkner K. Aufricht C. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 2400-2407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hsp70 is present ubiquitously in all renal tubular epithelial cells (13Muller E. Neuhofer W. Ohno A. Rucker S. Thurau K. Beck F.-X. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 608-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). During cellular recovery from renal ischemia, Hsp70 interacts with cytoskeletal elements (12Bidmon B. Endemann M. Muller T. Arbeiter K. Herkner K. Aufricht C. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 2400-2407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In LLC-PK1 cells, it has been reported that heat shock stress increases Hsp70 and SGLT1 activity, and mild heat shock stress protects the cell from injury (14Sussman C.R. Renfro J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: F530-F537Google Scholar). It is, however, unclear what mechanism is involved in the increase of SGLT1 activity. In the present study, we have shown that heat shock stress increases SGLT1 activity mediated via the production of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Furthermore, we found that TGF-β1 increases the interaction of SGLT1 with Hsp70, resulting in the increase of SGLT1 activity. A mouse monoclonal antibody raised Hsp70 (SPA-810) was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised actin (C-11) and a goat polyclonal antibody raised against aminopeptidase N were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised Hsp70 was from Upstate Biotechnology. This antibody was used in the experiments of transfection and interaction of SGLT1 with Hsp70 in vitro. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against porcine SGLT1 was kindly provided by Prof. Julie E. Lever (University of Texas Medical School, Houston). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse IgG was from American Qualex. Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG was from EY Laboratories. AMCA-labeled anti-goat IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. A porcine TGF-β1 was from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Chariot, a transfection reagent capable of delivering antibodies was from Active Motif. Protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. [14C]Methyl α-glucopyranoside was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other regents were of the highest grade of purity available. Porcine renal epithelial LLC-PK1cells were obtained from JCRB (Tokyo, Japan). Cells were maintained in Medium 199 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were grown to subconfluent or confluent conditions on 24-well plates and then treated with heat shock stress or TGF-β1 in FCS-free Medium 199. Heat shock stress was performed at 42 °C for 3 h and then at 37 °C for 12 h. TGF-β1 was added in FCS-free Medium 199 at the indicated times and concentrations. The SGLT1 activity was assayed by incubating in a Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing [14C]methyl α-glucopyranoside (0.4 μCi/ml), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 in the presence and absence of phloridzin (0.5 mm), a potent SGLT1 inhibitor. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the solution was aspirated quickly and washed by ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution without [14C]methyl α-glucopyranoside for 4 times. The cells were solubilized with 0.5 N NaOH and the aliquots were taken for determination of radioactivity and protein concentration. Protein concentration was measured using the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Whole membrane fraction was prepared from the cells cultured in 10-cm Petri dishes by the procedure of Peng and Lever (15Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20536-20542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed three times with Hanks’ balanced salt solution, scraped, and suspended in PBS containing 5 mmEDTA. After centrifugation at 80 × g for 5 min, the pellet was solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, sonicated, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellet was suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (membrane fraction). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (16Ikari A. Nakajima K. Kawano K. Suketa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, membrane preparations (20 μg) were applied to the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated for 1.5 h with each primary antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or mouse IgG. Finally, the blots were stained with the ECL Western blotting kit from Amersham Biosciences. The apical membrane fraction prepared as described elsewhere (17Turner R.J. Moran A. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F406-F414PubMed Google Scholar). The samples solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads and an antibody specific for the SGLT1 at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. After centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 1 min, the pellet was washed four times with a lysis buffer. The pellet was solubilized in a sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Western blotting was carried out as described above. Cells were grown to confluence on 24-well plate. A polyclonal antibody raised Hsp70 or an anti-rabbit IgG were transfected into the cells using a Chariot kit according to the appended protocol. After 3 h of transfection, the cells were treated with TGF-β1 followed by examining SGLT1 activity and localization of both SGLT1 and Hsp70. The cells grown on cover glass were incubated with FCS-free Medium 199 in the presence and absence of TGF-β1 and washed twice with PBS supplemented with 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 prior to fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde for 7 min at room temperature. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min and 5% goat serum in PBS (blocking solution) for 30 min. Incubation with anti-SGLT1, anti-Hsp70, and aminopeptidase N antibodies (final dilution 1/120) for 90 min at room temperature was followed by washes with PBS and then incubation for 90 min with Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG combined with anti-SGLT1 antibody, FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG combined with anti-Hsp70 antibody, and AMCA-labeled anti-goat IgG combined with anti-aminopeptidase N antibody in a blocking solution (dilution 1/20). Immunolabeled cells were visualized on a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) set with the appropriate filter for FITC (488 nm excitation, 530 nm emission filter), Texas Red (543 nm excitation, 585–615 nm emission filter), and AMCA detection (351 nm excitation, 450 nm emission filter). Images were collected at 1.0-μm increments (vertical direction) beginning at the apical membrane and ending at the basal membrane. Images were further processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe System, Inc). The apical membrane fraction was prepared from TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml, 2 h)-treated cells. The sample was preincubated with 5 mmATP/10 mm Mg2+ at 30 °C for 10 min and then incubated with lysis buffer containing hexokinase (50 units/ml) and 15 mm glucose at 30 °C for 10 min to remove ATP from the incubation solution (18Oiwa K. Kawakami T. Sugi H. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The aliquot was incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. After centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 1 min, the supernatant was incubated with the mixture of new beads and an antibody for SGLT1 at 4 °C for 12 h to immunoprecipitate proteins specifically interacting with SGLT1. After centrifugation, the pellet was solubilized in a sample buffer, and then SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were carried out as described above. The results are presented as the means ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and correction for multiple comparison was made using Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Statistically significant differences were assumed at p < 0.05. LLC-PK1 cells were utilized to examine the expression of SGLT1 and glucose absorption in renal proximal tubule. In this cell line, SGLT1 activity has been observed to develop after cell confluence (2Mullin J.M. Weibel J. Diamond L. Kleinzeller A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 104: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Shioda T. Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11919-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). First, we checked the expressions of SGLT1 and Hsp70 in the different growing stages (Fig.1A). Hsp70 was detected in both subconfluent and confluent conditions, but SGLT1 was not detected in the subconfluent condition. As a sample loading control, we observed that actin exists in the same amount in both the confluent and subconfluent conditions (data not shown). To confirm the expression pattern of SGLT1, we measured SGLT1 activity using [14C]methyl α-glucopyranoside. SGLT1 activity was observed in the confluent condition but not in the subconfluent condition (Fig. 1B). This result was coincident with the expression pattern of SGLT1 (Fig. 1A). In the confluent condition, heat shock stress increased SGLT1 activity that is neutralized by anti-TGF-β1 antibody (Fig.2A). Interestingly, Hsp70 expression was potently increased by heat shock stress, but SGLT1 was unchanged (Fig. 2B). An anti-TGF-β1 antibody scarcely affected the expression of SGLT1 and Hsp70. These results indicate that heat shock stress increases SGLT1 activity mediated via production of TGF-β1, and the inhibition of SGLT1 activity by an anti-TGF-β1 antibody is not caused by the decrease of SGLT1 expression. Next, we examined the regulatory mechanism of SGLT1 activity by TGF-β1. TGF-β1 increased SGLT1 activity in a time-dependent manner, and the maximal effect was observed at 2 h (Fig.3A). The effect of TGF-β1 (0.05–20 ng/ml) was dose-dependent, and the EC50 was 2 ng/ml (Fig. 3B). It has been reported that TGF-β1 increases glucose uptake by enhancing GLUT1 expression in mesangial cells (20Heilig C.W. Liu Y. England R.L. Freytag S.O. Gilbert J.D. Heilig K.O. Zhu M. Concepcion L.A. Brosius F.C. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Inoki K. Haneda M. Maeda S. Koya D. Kikkawa R. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1704-1712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked the expression level of SGLT1. TGF-β1 did not significantly increase SGLT1 expression compared with control (Fig.4A). Furthermore, heat shock stress increased Hsp70 expression, but TGF-β1 did not change it. Taken together, the increase of Hsp70 expression was not involved in the up-regulation of SGLT1 activity. So far, it has been reported that Hsp70 and related proteins interact with plasma membrane proteins such as Na+/H+-exchanger (11Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10412-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), Na+/K+-ATPase (12Bidmon B. Endemann M. Muller T. Arbeiter K. Herkner K. Aufricht C. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 2400-2407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), as well as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (22Choo-Kang L.R. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L58-L68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we examined the interaction level of SGLT1 with Hsp70. Membrane fractions prepared from control and TGF-β1-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Hsp70 or an anti-SGLT1 antibody. Then, each sample was reacted with an anti-SGLT1 antibody or an anti-Hsp70 antibody, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4B, TGF-β1 increased the interaction of SGLT1 with Hsp70.Figure 4Comparison of SGLT1 and Hsp70 expression levels.A, the membrane fractions were prepared from control cells (−) and 2 ng/ml TGF-β1-treated (+) cells. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-SGLT1 (SGLT1) or an anti-Hsp70 antibody (Hsp70). B, the membrane fractions prepared from control (−) and TGF-β1-treated (+) cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Hsp70 (left) or an anti-SGLT1 antibody (right) and then immunoblotted with an anti-SGLT1 or an anti-Hsp70 antibody, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We determined the localization of SGLT1 and Hsp70 by immunocytochemistry (Fig.5A). Aminopeptidase N, an apical membrane marker protein, appeared as bluefluorescence only in the apical membrane site. Hsp70, which appeared asgreenfluorescence, was localized in the entire plasma membrane and cytosol fraction. SGLT1 appeared as redfluorescence. The image of SGLT1 merged with that of aminopeptidase N showed an intermediate color of purple in the TGF-β1-treated cells, indicating that SGLT1 and aminopeptidase N were co-localized near the apical membrane site (Fig.5A, upper panels). Furthermore, co-localization of SGLT1 and Hsp70, appearing as yellow, was moved from the cytosol fraction to the apical membrane site by TGF-β1 (Fig.5A, lower panels). Next, we examined the effect of an anti-Hsp70 antibody on the localization of SGLT1 and Hsp70. Transfection of an anti-Hsp70 antibody into the cells using a Chariot kit inhibited the TGF-β1-induced movement of SGLT1 and Hsp70 to the apical membrane site (Fig. 5B, right). In control cells, an anti-rabbit IgG did not affect co-localization of SGLT1 and Hsp70 (Fig. 5B, left). In the rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing human insulin receptors, microinjection of an anti-Hsp70 antibody into the cells partially inhibited insulin-stimulated mitogenesis (23Takata Y. Imamura T. Iwata M. Usui I. Haruta T. Nandachi N. Ishiki M. Sasaoka T. Kobayashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To examine the necessity of the interaction of SGLT1 with Hsp70 in the elevation of SGLT1 activity, we examined the effect of an anti-Hsp70 antibody on SGLT1 activity. This antibody (1.8 μg/ml) inhibited TGF-β1-elicited SGLT1 activation and slightly inhibited basal SGLT1 activity (Fig.6). This inhibitory effect on SGLT1 activity corresponds to localization of SGLT1 and Hsp70. In control cells, an anti-rabbit IgG (1.8 μg/ml) did not inhibit TGF-β1-elicited SGLT1 activation. These results indicate that interaction of SGLT1 with Hsp70 induces an elevation of SGLT1 activity. Hsp70 and its related protein bind specifically to hydrophobic peptide segments in an ATP-dependent manner (24Yet S.F. Kong C.T. Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We examined whether SGLT1 interacts with Hsp70 in vitro (Fig.7). Hsp70 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-SGLT1 antibody in the absence of ATP. After incubation of the apical membrane fraction with ATP (5 mm), Hsp70 dissociated from SGLT1. Interestingly, the removal of ATP by hexokinase and glucose induced a re-interaction of Hsp70 with SGLT1. This interaction was inhibited by an anti-Hsp70 antibody but not by a anti-rabbit IgG. We detected no band in the membrane that was not incubated with an anti-Hsp70 antibody (data not shown), indicating an anti-Hsp70 antibody did not contaminate the samples. The interaction of Hsp70 with SGLT1 corresponds to the co-localization data shown in Fig. 6. The mRNA and transport activity of SGLT1 are not detectable in subconfluent LLC-PK1 cells as shown by Northern blotting and glucose transport assay (2Mullin J.M. Weibel J. Diamond L. Kleinzeller A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 104: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Shioda T. Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We also showed that SGLT1 protein did not express in the subconfluent condition and that SGLT1 protein and activity appeared only in the confluent condition (Fig. 1). On the contrary, Hsp70 expressed in both the subconfluent and the confluent conditions. Hsp70 and related proteins play an essential role under normal physiological condition, including assisting in the folding of newly synthesized proteins, translocating proteins to the appropriate organs, and dissociating protein aggregates (7Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar, 8Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 9Beck F.-X. Neuhofer W. Muller E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F203-F215PubMed Google Scholar). So far, mammalian Hsp70 has been reported to interact with some transporters expressed in epithelial plasma membrane to maintain their functions (10Sarrio S. Casado V. Escriche M. Ciruela F. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5164-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L.

However, there is no report on whether Hsp70 interacts with SGLT1 and is involved in the regulation of SGLT1 activity. Heat shock, oxidants, tissue trauma, and hormonal stimulation increase the expression of Hsp70 and related proteins. Some stresses induce the production of TGF-β1, a multifunctional cytokine, which transmits various cellular responses such as cell proliferation and formation of the extracellular matrix (25Cao Y.

Cell. 1992; 69: 1067-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the release of TGF-β1 increased in LLC-PK1 cells developing after cell confluence (29Phillips A.O. Steadman R. Morrisey K. Williams J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that heat shock stress increases SGLT1 activity mediated via production of TGF-β1 (Fig.2A). TGF-β receptors are divided into three types; type I (53 kDa), type II (70–85 kDa), and type III (250–350 kDa) (30Massague J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1067-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The signal is primarily through the TGF-β type II receptor, and then phosphorylation of type I receptor activates protein kinases. TGF-β1 has been reported to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity quickly in LLC-PK1 cells (31Anderson R.J. Sponsel H.T. Breckon R. Marcell T. Hoeffler J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F584-F591PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase A up-regulates SGLT1 mRNA level after a 2–4-day lag period, accompanied by pronounced stabilization of the message (15Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20536-20542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, heat shock stress did not significantly increase the expression level of SGLT1 protein within 12 h (Fig.2B). We suggest that heat shock stress induces SGLT1 activation without increasing SGLT1 expression in the short term. TGF-β1 increased SGLT1 activity but did not change the expression levels of SGLT1 and Hsp70 (Figs. 3 and 4). An anti-TGF-β1 antibody inhibited SGLT1 activation induced by heat shock stress but had no effect on the Hsp70 expression (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the increase of Hsp70 is independent of the regulation of SGLT1 activity and is not an important phenomenon in up-regulating SGLT1 activity. Recently, Bidmon et al. (12Bidmon B. Endemann M. Muller T. Arbeiter K. Herkner K. Aufricht C. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 2400-2407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that the interaction of Hsp70 with Na+/K+-ATPase is increased following stabilization of Na+/K+-ATPase within the cytoskeletal fraction during the restoration of the renal cells after ischemia. We found that SGLT1 interacts with Hsp70 under normal conditions and TGF-β1 increases the interaction level between them (Fig. 4B). We hypothesized that the interaction of SGLT1 with Hsp70 and the localization of these proteins in the apical membrane site are important in increasing SGLT1 activity. As determined by immunocytochemistry, TGF-β1 made move both SGLT1 and Hsp70 near the apical membrane site (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, an anti-Hsp70 antibody inhibited the co-localization of SGLT1 and Hsp70 in TGF-β1-treated cells (Fig. 5B). Transfection of an anti-Hsp70 antibody inhibited the elevation of SGLT1 activity elicited by TGF-β1 (Fig. 6). These results suggest that translocation of Hsp70 from the cytosol to the apical membrane site is important in stabilizing SGLT1 expression on the membrane and up-regulating glucose uptake. To confirm the interaction of SGLT1 with Hsp70, we performed immunoprecipitation assay in vitro. Hsp70 and its related protein bind specifically to hydrophobic peptide segments that are not conserved, in an ATP-dependent manner (32Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The ADP-bound form of Hsp70 has a high affinity for peptides, whereas the ATP form has a low affinity. ATP dissociated Hsp70 from SGLT1 in the apical membrane fraction (Fig. 7). The removal of ATP induced a re-interaction of these proteins. Furthermore, an anti-Hsp70 antibody inhibited the interaction in vitro similar to what is shown in Fig. 5B. These results indicate that Hsp70 interacts with SGLT1 in an ATP-dependent manner. Furthermore, an anti-Hsp70 antibody blocked interaction of these proteins, leading to inhibition of SGLT1 activity. In conclusion, we found that heat shock stress increased SGLT1 activity mediated via TGF-β1 production. However, the treatment of the cells with heat shock stress or TGF-β1 for short periods did not increase SGLT1 expression. TGF-β1 increased the interaction of SGLT1 with Hsp70 and translocated them near the apical membrane. These results suggest that Hsp70 supports the apical localization and function of SGLT1 under both normal and restorative conditions after injury with heat shock stress. We thank Prof. J. E. Lever (University of Texas Medical School, Houston) for providing a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised porcine SGLT1."

Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000Google Scholar). The best-studied stress response is the so-called heat shock response, which is induced after a sudden increase in temperature. This response is characterized by the transiently enhanced synthesis of a group of proteins collectively known as heat shock proteins encoded by heat shock genes. Work carried out over the last 5 years has revealed that in most eubacteria heat shock genes are organized in two and more regulons, where each regulon is either under positive control of an alternative sigma factor or under negative control of a transcriptional repressor (2Narberhaus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Yura T. Kanemori M. Morita M. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Response.

This protein binds to an operator designated CIRCE1(Controlling Inverted Repeat ofChaperone Expression) (6Zuber U. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which precedes the heptacistronic dnaK and the bicistronic groEoperon (7Wetzstein M. Vo¨lker U. Dedio J. Lo¨bau S. Zuber U.

Upon a heat shock, HrcA dissociates from its operators leading to a transient induction of the two operons followed by rebinding after about 10 min (7Wetzstein M. Vo¨lker U. Dedio J. Lo¨bau S. Zuber U. Schiesswohl M. Herget C. Hecker M. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3300-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schmidt A. Schiesswohl M. Vo¨lker U. Hecker M. Schumann W. J.

The pertinent question concerning all heat shock regulators is how the activity of these proteins is modulated after a heat shock. In the present case, we have presented data suggesting that the activity of HrcA is modulated by the GroE chaperonin system (11Mogk A. Homuth G. Scholz C. Kim L. Schmid F.X. Schumann W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4579-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HrcA is maintained in an active conformation able to bind to CIRCE through GroE. Under conditions of increased formation of nonnative proteins in the cell, GroE is titrated by these proteins and is no longer available to activate HrcA. This titration model is strengthened by the fact that not only heat shock but also ethanol stress, treatment with puromycin, and artificial overproduction of GroE substrates induce the HrcA regulon (12Mogk A. Vo¨lker A. Engelmann S. Hecker M. Schumann W. Vo¨lker U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2895-2900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Proof of our model at the molecular level has been hampered so far by the fact that HrcA overproduced in Escherichia coli cells forms inclusion bodies (11Mogk A. Homuth G. Scholz C. Kim L. Schmid F.X. Schumann W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4579-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These can be dissolved in the presence of a chaotropic agent such as guanidinium hydrochloride, but upon its removal HrcA molecules aggregate again. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to obtain HrcA in a soluble and active form to investigate the influence of the GroE system on its activity more precisely. Although our attempts to refold and solubilize HrcA by a method published most recently for Bacillus thermoglucosidasius HrcA (13Watanabe K. Yamamoto T. Suzuki Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and by another biochemical method failed, we devised a genetic method to isolate mutant HrcA proteins that show increased repressor binding activity under conditions of reduced GroE function, with the expectation that these proteins also might be less prone to aggregation. Several of these mutants were obtained, and one mutant could indeed be purified under native conditions. This protein was able to specifically retard a DNA fragment containing the CIRCE element in a still GroE-dependent manner, leading to two different complexes. It specifically protected a DNA fragment carrying the CIRCE element in DNase I footprint experiments. In addition, we could show a direct interaction between HrcA114 and GroEL in vitro.DISCUSSIONRegulation of heat shock genes by the HrcA repressor protein binding to the CIRCE operator is widespread within the eubacterial kingdom and occurs both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative species (5Schumann W.

Common to all regulatory systems involved in the heat shock response is the transient induction of the heat shock genes. This implies that, in the case of positive regulation, the transcriptional regulator has to be transiently activated, and, in the case of negative regulation, to be transiently inactivated. For HrcA of B. subtilis, four lines of experimental data strongly suggest that the activity of this repressor protein is modulated by the GroE chaperonin system: (i) depletion of GroES/EL in B. subtilisresulted in increased expression of the Class I heat shock genes controlled by HrcA; (ii) overexpression of GroEL in B. subtilis reduced both the basal and the induced level of Class I heat shock proteins after a heat shock; (iii) purified GroEL significantly enhanced binding of HrcA to the CIRCE element in gel retardation assays; (iv) the basal level of expression of an HrcA-controlled reporter gene was greatly augmented in both E. coli groES30 and groEL100 strains (11Mogk A. Homuth G. Scholz C. Kim L. Schmid F.X. Schumann W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4579-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These data led us to suggest a titration model where the amount of active HrcA, which is able to bind to the CIRCE operator is directly correlated to the amount of available GroE system. Upon a sudden heat shock, denatured proteins titrate the GroE chaperonins, thereby increasing the amount of inactive HrcA repressor, which is unable to interact with the CIRCE element. The more denatured proteins are removed from the cell, the more GroE chaperonins are available to convert inactive HrcA into its active form (12Mogk A. Vo¨lker A. Engelmann S. Hecker M. Schumann W. Vo¨lker U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2895-2900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This in turn leads to the shut off of the Class I heat shock genes under constantly high temperature conditions (7Wetzstein M. Vo¨lker U. Dedio J. Lo¨bau S. Zuber U. Schiesswohl M. Herget C. Hecker M. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3300-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schmidt A. Schiesswohl M. Vo¨lker U. Hecker M. Schumann W. J.

This direct HrcA-GroE interaction model has been challenged by Minder et al. (29Minder A.C. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) whom did not see a more efficient retardation of target DNA by HrcA ofBradyrhizobium japonicum in the presence of added GroEL. Furthermore, researchers performing experiments with HrcA ofClostridium acetobutylicum and Lactococcus lactisdetected an influence of DnaK on the activity of HrcA (30Ru¨ngeling E. Laufen T. Bahl H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 170: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31Koch B. Kilstrup M. Vogensen F.K. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3873-3881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of particular importance first to demonstrate a direct interaction between HrcA and the GroE system and second to define the active and inactive forms of HrcA.The observation that HrcA synthesized in the temperature-sensitiveE. coli groES30 and groEL100 mutant strains is inactive suggested a screening system to obtainhrcA mutant alleles exhibiting increased repressor activity. The groES30 and groEL100 mutations reduce the overall activity of the GroE system, and HrcA seems to be specifically sensitive to this reduced activity. Whereas the GroES30 protein carries an amino acid replacement within the mobile loop (A31V) (32Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which is involved in the interaction with GroEL, that in GroEL100 (S201F) (33Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is located in the apical domain involved in the binding of nonnative proteins (34Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 35Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Error-prone PCR mutagenesis produced a total of ten mutant hrcA alleles using E. coli groES30 as a recipient. No mutants were directly found inE. coli groEL100. This could indicate that single and even double point mutations are not enough or too rare to produce the desired phenotype. This possibility is strengthened by the finding that hrcA6 carrying one point mutation when going through a second round of error-prone mutagenesis resulted in the mutant allelehrcA11, now carrying three point mutations and exhibiting reduced basal activity in the E. coli groEL100strain. That these mutant hrcA alleles display increased independence from the GroE chaperonin machine rather than being allele-specific suppressors is emphasized by the finding that they display comparable activities in both E. coli groES30 and groEL100.Amino acid residues that were replaced in the mutant forms of HrcA were not clustered in a hot spot. They do not reveal a specific conservation among the various HrcAs of different species, taken into account that there is only little sequence conservation between the different HrcA proteins. Stabilization of proteins is often encountered with a change in charge distribution of surface-exposed amino acid residues (36Martin A. Sieber V. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For example, the point mutation D302G that was found after a second mutagenesis cycle in the groEL100 screen possibly causes such a stabilizing effect, which may be underlined by the fact that the two HrcAs from thermophilic Bacillus species (B. stearothermophilus and B. thermoglucosidasius) possess a glycine residue at the respective position. Nevertheless, because the three-dimensional structure has yet not been resolved and there is little sequence homology, the nature of the point mutations remains speculative.It is of special interest that the reduced dependence on GroE of at least three mutant forms of HrcA tested (HrcA4, HrcA11, and HrcA114) correlated with enhanced solubility of the overexpressed proteins (data not shown and Fig. 3). Nevertheless, HrcA4 and HrcA11 purified under native conditions were inactive in gel retardation assays with a CIRCE-containing DNA fragment. HrcA114 was active, but the high molar ratio of DNA:protein (1:2000) for a complete retardation of the DNA fragment reveals that the soluble protein is also mainly present in an inactive form, what has already been shown for the B. japonicum HrcA purified under native conditions (29Minder A.C. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This underlines that solubility of HrcA is not tantamount to full activity of the repressor. Recently, a method has been published allowing effective renaturation and solubilization of B. thermoglucosidasius HrcA with added DNA, leading to a fully active HrcA (13Watanabe K. Yamamoto T. Suzuki Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This technique failed to work with wild-type HrcA ofB. subtilis. Furthermore, we could detect only a slight increase of DNA-binding activity of renatured HrcA protein, when CIRCE-containing DNA was added (data not shown).Mutant HrcA114 with five amino acid replacements is of crucial importance, because its enhanced solubility allowed further biochemical characterization of B. subtilis HrcA in general. When expressed in B. subtilis, it behaved like wild-type HrcA with respect to basal activity and induction of a Class I promoter (Table III). Differences could only be seen under conditions of GroE limitation, with a reduced but still measurable dependence on GroE in a depletion assay (Table IV and Fig. 4). Addition of GroE together with ATP increased the DNA binding activity of HrcA114 (Fig. 5, lanes 3–5). Furthermore, what could be shown for the first time for an HrcA repressor, HrcA114 displayed a high binding affinity for GroEL compared with DnaK and HtpG as a control (Fig. 7). On the basis of the titration model, this means that HrcA114 is indeed more independent on GroE function but still binds to the chaperonin and needs at least some of its activity. In vivo substrates of the E. coli GroE system have been identified (37Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). They are characterized by a molecular mass of 20–60 kDa and αβ domains that have α-helices and β-sheets with extensive hydrophobic surfaces. HrcA has a molecular mass of 39 kDa and, according to secondary structure predictions, possesses several α-helices and β-sheets (data not shown). The HrcA114 mutant protein should be characterized by a more stable folding and thereby be less dependent on the GroE chaperonin system.There have been several publications demonstrating specific interaction between purified HrcA and a CIRCE element containing DNA fragment in gel retardation assays, including HrcA from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus japonicum, B. thermoglucosidasius, and B. stearothermophilus (13Watanabe K. Yamamoto T. Suzuki Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Minder A.C. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Kim S.-N. Kim S.-W. Pyo S.-N. Rhee D.-K. Mol. Cells. 2001; 11: 360-368PubMed Google Scholar, 39Martirani L. Raniello R.

Biol. 1986; 187: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but all groups reported only one retarded complex. We cannot exclude that the two forms we see in retardation assays represent two different oligomeric states of HrcA114, but the still high tendency of HrcA114 to aggregate prevented further biochemical characterization. The DNase I footprint shows protection of the leading and lagging strand in an asymmetric way, suggesting that HrcA like most repressors acts at least as a dimer, as it was reported for HrcA from S. thermophilus and B. thermoglucosidasius (13Watanabe K. Yamamoto T. Suzuki Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Martirani L. Raniello R. Naclerio G. Ricca E. De Felice M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 198: 177-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It has been described that HrcA of B. thermoglucosidasiusmay directly act as a thermosensor. Based on the fact that GroE had only a minor effect on preventing HrcA aggregation at different temperatures compared with DNA, it was suggested that GroE is mainly needed for the activation of newly synthesized repressor (13Watanabe K. Yamamoto T. Suzuki Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our band shift experiments also demonstrate that the activity of HrcA is influenced by the incubation temperature, but this effect could be largely suppressed by adding the complete GroE system (Fig. 5,lanes 8–15). Although HrcA seems to exhibit an intrinsic thermolability, the fact that the heat shock response is shut off after about 10 min under retention of the heat shock conditions (17Schulz A. Tzschaschel B. Schumann W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) supports the titration model. Therefore, we propose a combined model where HrcA exhibits intrinsic thermolability, but the main modulating system is the titration of the GroE chaperonin machine.In summary, we have succeeded for the first time to obtain purified soluble HrcA protein of B. subtilis specifically retarding a DNA fragment containing the CIRCE element. Two different complexes were produced never reported so far in band shift experiments with HrcA, and further work has to elucidate the stoichiometry within these complexes and their biological function. We also succeeded for the first time to obtain a footprint with HrcA showing that it completely protected the CIRCE element and neighboring sequences in an asymmetric way. Further work has to reveal whether this footprint correlates with the faster or slower migrating complex seen in the band shift assay. Finally, we succeeded in demonstrating that immobilized HrcA specifically interacts with GroEL from crude extracts. All these results are fully in compliance with our model that HrcA of B. subtilis needs the complete GroE machine for activation. Definition of the active and the inactive state of HrcA awaits further extensive experimentation, which is underway in our laboratory. Bacteria encode genetic systems allowing them to adapt to many stressful situations, including high and low temperature, hyperosmotic and oxidative stress, and severe DNA damage (1Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000Google Scholar). The best-studied stress response is the so-called heat shock response, which is induced after a sudden increase in temperature. This response is characterized by the transiently enhanced synthesis of a group of proteins collectively known as heat shock proteins encoded by heat shock genes. Work carried out over the last 5 years has revealed that in most eubacteria heat shock genes are organized in two and more regulons, where each regulon is either under positive control of an alternative sigma factor or under negative control of a transcriptional repressor (2Narberhaus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Yura T. Kanemori M. Morita M. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Response. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 3-18Google Scholar, 4Servant P. Mazodier P. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Schumann W. Hecker M. Msadek T. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus Subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2001Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, three different regulons have been identified so far, where Class I heat shock genes are under the negative control of the HrcA transcriptional repressor. This protein binds to an operator designated CIRCE1(Controlling Inverted Repeat ofChaperone Expression) (6Zuber U. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which precedes the heptacistronic dnaK and the bicistronic groEoperon (7Wetzstein M. Vo¨lker U. Dedio J. Lo¨bau S. Zuber U. Schiesswohl M. Herget C. Hecker M. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3300-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schmidt A. Schiesswohl M. Vo¨lker U. Hecker M. Schumann W. J.

Upon a heat shock, HrcA dissociates from its operators leading to a transient induction of the two operons followed by rebinding after about 10 min (7Wetzstein M. Vo¨lker U. Dedio J. Lo¨bau S. Zuber U. Schiesswohl M. Herget C. Hecker M. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3300-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schmidt A. Schiesswohl M. Vo¨lker U. Hecker M. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3993-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Homuth G. Mogk A. Schumann W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1183-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pertinent question concerning all heat shock regulators is how the activity of these proteins is modulated after a heat shock. In the present case, we have presented data suggesting that the activity of HrcA is modulated by the GroE chaperonin system (11Mogk A. Homuth G. Scholz C. Kim L. Schmid F.X. Schumann W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4579-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HrcA is maintained in an active conformation able to bind to CIRCE through GroE. Under conditions of increased formation of nonnative proteins in the cell, GroE is titrated by these proteins and is no longer available to activate HrcA. This titration model is strengthened by the fact that not only heat shock but also ethanol stress, treatment with puromycin, and artificial overproduction of GroE substrates induce the HrcA regulon (12Mogk A. Vo¨lker A. Engelmann S. Hecker M. Schumann W. Vo¨lker U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2895-2900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proof of our model at the molecular level has been hampered so far by the fact that HrcA overproduced in Escherichia coli cells forms inclusion bodies (11Mogk A. Homuth G. Scholz C. Kim L. Schmid F.X. Schumann W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4579-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These can be dissolved in the presence of a chaotropic agent such as guanidinium hydrochloride, but upon its removal HrcA molecules aggregate again. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to obtain HrcA in a soluble and active form to investigate the influence of the GroE system on its activity more precisely. Although our attempts to refold and solubilize HrcA by a method published most recently for Bacillus thermoglucosidasius HrcA (13Watanabe K. Yamamoto T. Suzuki Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and by another biochemical method failed, we devised a genetic method to isolate mutant HrcA proteins that show increased repressor binding activity under conditions of reduced GroE function, with the expectation that these proteins also might be less prone to aggregation. Several of these mutants were obtained, and one mutant could indeed be purified under native conditions. This protein was able to specifically retard a DNA fragment containing the CIRCE element in a still GroE-dependent manner, leading to two different complexes. It specifically protected a DNA fragment carrying the CIRCE element in DNase I footprint experiments. In addition, we could show a direct interaction between HrcA114 and GroEL in vitro. DISCUSSIONRegulation of heat shock genes by the HrcA repressor protein binding to the CIRCE operator is widespread within the eubacterial kingdom and occurs both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative species (5Schumann W.

Common to all regulatory systems involved in the heat shock response is the transient induction of the heat shock genes. This implies that, in the case of positive regulation, the transcriptional regulator has to be transiently activated, and, in the case of negative regulation, to be transiently inactivated. For HrcA of B. subtilis, four lines of experimental data strongly suggest that the activity of this repressor protein is modulated by the GroE chaperonin system: (i) depletion of GroES/EL in B. subtilisresulted in increased expression of the Class I heat shock genes controlled by HrcA; (ii) overexpression of GroEL in B. subtilis reduced both the basal and the induced level of Class I heat shock proteins after a heat shock; (iii) purified GroEL significantly enhanced binding of HrcA to the CIRCE element in gel retardation assays; (iv) the basal level of expression of an HrcA-controlled reporter gene was greatly augmented in both E. coli groES30 and groEL100 strains (11Mogk A. Homuth G. Scholz C. Kim L. Schmid F.X. Schumann W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4579-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These data led us to suggest a titration model where the amount of active HrcA, which is able to bind to the CIRCE operator is directly correlated to the amount of available GroE system. Upon a sudden heat shock, denatured proteins titrate the GroE chaperonins, thereby increasing the amount of inactive HrcA repressor, which is unable to interact with the CIRCE element. The more denatured proteins are removed from the cell, the more GroE chaperonins are available to convert inactive HrcA into its active form (12Mogk A. Vo¨lker A. Engelmann S. Hecker M. Schumann W.

The purpose of this study is to try to understand what can trigger an effective immune response against Tat. We used five Tat variants from HIV strains identified in different parts of the world and showed that mutations of as much as 38% exist without any change in activity. Rabbit sera were raised against Tat variants identified in rapid-progressor patients (Tat HXB2, a European variant and Tat Eli, an African variant) and a long term non-progressor patient (Tat Oyi, an inactive African variant). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that anti-Tat Oyi serum had the highest antibody titer and was the only one to have a broad antibody response against heterologous Tat variants. Surprisingly, Tat HXB2 was better recognized by anti-Tat Oyi serum compared with anti-Tat HXB2 serum. Western blots showed that non-homologous Tat variants were recognized by antibodies directed against conformational epitopes. This study suggests that the primary and tertiary structures of the Tat variant from the long term non-progressor patient are critical to the induction of a broad and effective antibody response against Tat.

Furthermore, clinical studies show that an immune response against Tat correlates with the low viral load in HIV-1 sero-positive patients in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (3Zagury J.F.

Interestingly, an epidemiological study in Gabon showed that patients infected by the HIV-1 Oyi strain were long term non-progressors (26Huet T. Dazza M.C. Brun-Vezinet F. Roelants G.E. Wain-Hobson S. AIDS. 1989; 3: 707-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No anomaly was found in the virus sequence except in the gene tat where the mutation of cysteine 22 to serine seemed to account for the loss of transactivation activity (26Huet T. Dazza M.C. Brun-Vezinet F. Roelants G.E. Wain-Hobson S. AIDS. 1989; 3: 707-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we show that Tat variants do not induce the same antibody response, a possible reason why only a minority of HIV-1 sero-positive patients have an effective antibody response against Tat. The actual evolution of HIV-1 permits the division of Tat variants into five main groups corresponding to the five HIV-1 subtypes called A, B, C, D, and AE (27Osmanov S. Pattou C. Walker N. Schwardlander B. Esparza J. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 2002; 29: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We show that sera raised against a European Tat subtype B such as HXB2 (28Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.F. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A Baumeister K.

Cell. 1986; 46: 63-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) have a low antibody response against non-homologous Tat variants. Interestingly, the Tat Oyi subtype B variant, which is inactive and comes from a long term non-progressor patient, can induce a high antibody response against all Tat variants. Proteins were assembled in solid phase synthesis according to the method of Barany and Merrifield (30Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meinhofer J. The Peptide: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 1-284Google Scholar). Synthesis of Tat Oyi and Tat Eli were described previously (31Péloponèse Jr., J.M. Collette Y. Gregoire C. Bailly C. Campese D.

The synthesis of Tat HXB2, 92Br, CM240, and Ug11RP were carried out according to the same procedure. 2D. Esquieu et al., submitted manuscript. Twelve specific pathogen-free New Zealand rabbits, (Elevage Scientifique des Dombes, Romans, France) were immunized intradermally with 100 μg of synthetic Tat protein mixed with an equal volume of phosphate buffer 100 mm, pH6, NaCl 140 mm, and complete Freund Adjuvant (Sigma). Three rabbits were immunized with Tat HXB2, four with Tat Eli, and four with Tat Oyi. Each animal was boosted three times with 100 μg of Tat in phosphate buffer 100 mm, pH6, NaCl 140 mm, and incomplete Freund Adjuvant (Sigma). Sera were collected before immunization 60 and 90 days postimmunization. Functional transactivation by HIV-1 Tat variants were assessed using HeLa P4 cells as previously described (31Péloponèse Jr., J.M. Collette Y. Gregoire C. Bailly C. Campese D. Meurs E.F Olive D. Loret E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11473-11478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These HeLa cells have a bacterial lacZ gene under the control of the HIV LTR, and cytoplasmic accumulation of β-galactosidase reveals the presence of active Tat. 2 × 105 cells/well were incubated in a 24-well plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and Tat protein diluted in DMEM supplemented with 0.01% Protamine (Sigma), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was added. Two concentrations of the Tat proteins were tested (0.5 μm and 1 μm) in order to verify that the level of β-galactosidase is dose-dependent regarding extracellular Tat. After 16 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 cells were washed with PBS and lysed. Proteins were extracted, and the β-galactosidase content was measured with a commercial antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (β-galactosidase ELISA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In Fig. 3absorbance values (B) were measured at 405 nm.B0 corresponds to β-galactosidase expressed by the HeLa cells in DMEM, 0.01% Protamine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin without Tat. The serum anti-Tat antibodies were detected by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using Maxisorp U96 immunoplate (Nunc). The concentration of antigen was 2 μg/ml diluted in phosphate buffer 100 mm pH 6. Under these conditions the Tat protein adopts tertiary active structure (31Péloponèse Jr., J.M. Collette Y.

Immunoplates were coated with 100 μl/well antigen or phosphate buffer and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 2% milk. 100 μl of sera diluted in PBS supplemented with 0.2% milk was added to duplicate wells and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. 100 μl of anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate monoclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 in PBS and 0.2% milk was added to each well for 60 min at room temperature. 100 μl of ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma) was added to each well, and absorbance was read in an EL800 universal microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments) at 405 nm. After each incubation plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Genaxis). Titration curves were obtained with the MicrocalTM Origin 4.1 software using a sigmoidal fit. For negative controls a pool of all the pre-immunization rabbit sera was used. The mean of the negative controls plus three S.D. represented the cutoff value. Recognition of human serum albumin (Sigma) and Protamine by the serum, before and after immunization, was tested under the same conditions (data not shown). Proteins (5 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%) under reducing conditions (urea, 6 m; Tween 20, 1% in phosphate buffer 100 mm, pH 4.5, at 96 °C for 10 min). Tat proteins were then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was also performed on strips. Strips were incubated for 1 h with 20% milk and 1 h with anti-Tat rabbit sera at dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:100. The secondary antibody was peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 and bands developed with H2O2 (0.1%) diaminobenzide tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) in PBS buffer as substrate. The AIDS epidemic is in constant evolution, and the geographical diversity of HIV-1 strains is reflected in the Tat sequences with as much as 38% mutations observed between Tat variants (Fig. 1). In this study, we used the subtype A Ug11RP (found in eastern/central Africa), a subtype B represented by HXB2 (found in Europe and North America), a subtype C represented by 92BR (common to south America, southern Africa, and India), a subtype D represented by Tat Eli (found in eastern/central Africa) and a subtype AE represented by CM240 (found in southeast Asia) (Fig. 1). We tested the ability of these Tat variants to cross the membrane and transactivate the HIV-1 LTR in transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2). With the exception of Tat Oyi, all the Tat variants tested had transactivation activity (Fig. 2). This result shows that Tat variability presents a problem for the development of a Tat vaccine, because many mutations can be tolerated without the loss of Tat activity. For example, there is only 62% identity between the sequences of HXB2 and CM240 (Fig. 1). Moreover, the different vaccine approaches targeting Tat (20Cafaro A. Caputo A. Fracasso C. Maggiorella M.T.

The pre-immunization sera show that the Tat variants can be recognized nonspecifically at low sera dilution (Fig.3). TableI shows that the Tat Oyi serum had the highest antibody response against different Tat variants. Surprisingly, the titration curve for Tat HXB2 (Fig. 3 B) shows that the anti-Tat Oyi serum recognizes Tat HXB2 better than the anti-Tat HXB2 serum. The antibody response against Tat Eli is the lowest compared with Tat HXB2 and Tat Oyi with a homologous titer of 256,000 at 60 days postinfection (Table I). The antibody response against Tat HXB2 and Tat Oyi was maximal at 60 days postinfection. Only the serum against Tat Eli has an anamnestic response, with an increase in titer between 60 and 90 days postinfection (data not shown).Table ITitre of Pooled Rabbit Sera Against the Different Variants of Tat (60 Days Postinfection)Anti HXB2Anti ELIAnti OyiPreimmuneUG11RP2,00016,0008,000500HXB2512,00016,000512,000125OYI32,0008,000512,00012592Br32,00032,00032,000250Eli4,000256,00016,000500CM2408,0004,000128,000250Titre corresponds to the reciprocal of the last positive dilution obtained by ELISA (cut-off: mean of preimmun sera + 3 S.D.). Open table in a new tab Titre corresponds to the reciprocal of the last positive dilution obtained by ELISA (cut-off: mean of preimmun sera + 3 S.D.). Sera were tested against different Tat variants representative of subtypes A, B, C, D, and AE (Fig. 1). The titration curves show that the three sera did not have the same reactivity against the Tat variants (Fig. 3). Only Tat 92Br was similarly recognized by the three sera (Fig. 3 C). Tat Oyi serum had a higher antibody response against non-homologous Tat compared with the two other sera (Fig. 3). The only exception was the Tat Eli serum against Ug11RP (Fig. 3 A). It is interesting to observe that Tat Oyi has the greatest sequence homology with Tat HXB2, with only 14 mutations between the two proteins (Fig. 1). It is therefore surprising to observe such differences between the antibody response of these two proteins and a better antibody response against Tat HXB2 with the Tat Oyi serum (Fig. 3 B). The recognition pattern seen in ELISA tests was lost following the denaturation of Tat variants during Western blot analysis. Tat HXB2 serum diluted at 1:1000 recognized Tat HXB2, Oyi, 92Br and Eli but not Ug11RP and CM240 (Fig.4 A). At the same dilution, Tat Eli serum recognized all the variants, but the bands corresponding to non-homologous Tat variants (Fig. 4 B) were weak. Tat Oyi serum diluted at 1:1000 (Fig. 4 C) and 1:100 (data not shown) recognized all the variants except Tat Ug11RP. We noted that for 92Br the three sera have the same titer in Table I, but the intensity of the band differs. As a control, a pool of the pre-immune sera was used both at 1:100 and 1:1000, and no bands were observed (data not shown). In this study we have tried to understand why only a minority of patients develop an effective antibody response against Tat and become long term non-progressors. Apart from human genetic factors, the result of this study suggests that the primary and tertiary structures of Tat variants can dramatically influence the magnitude and breadth of antibody response against Tat. The choice of Tat Oyi to represent Tat variants from long term non-progressor patients was motivated by a follow up of HIV infection during the eighties in a remote area of Gabon showing that a large majority of HIV-infected patients were long term non-progressors (26Huet T. Dazza M.C. Brun-Vezinet F. Roelants G.E. Wain-Hobson S. AIDS. 1989; 3: 707-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high proportion of long term non-progressors was difficult to explain by genetic factors, and our hypothesis is that these individuals developed an immune response against Tat. This hypothesis was not mentioned by Huet et al. (26Huet T. Dazza M.C. Brun-Vezinet F. Roelants G.E. Wain-Hobson S. AIDS. 1989; 3: 707-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because the role of extracellular Tat was unknown at that time. However, the authors mentioned that the tat gene was defective because of the mutation C22S, and reversion of this mutation could lead to an effective tat gene (26Huet T. Dazza M.C. Brun-Vezinet F. Roelants G.E. Wain-Hobson S. AIDS. 1989; 3: 707-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation C22S certainly explains why Tat Oyi can not transactivate in our cellular assay (Fig. 2), but it certainly does not explain why the Tat Oyi serum has the highest antibody response against non-homologous Tat variants in comparison to the other two sera (Fig.3). Other mutations in Oyi compared with HXB2 certainly play a role in this antibody response (Fig. 1). These mutations are located mainly in the cysteine-rich region and the glutamine-rich region, which have been identified as the two main epitopes in Tat (34Rodman T.C., To, S.E. Hashish H. Manchester K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7719-7723Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the unique mutation E99F observed in the C terminus might also be important. Epitope mapping of Tat has been carried out only with a short Tat variant of 86 residues. Thus the immunological properties of residues 87–101 in the long Tat variants are unknown. The PIP sequence is common in the glutamine-rich region of Tat ELI and Tat Ug11RP (Fig. 1). This sequence could explain why the Tat ELI serum can still recognize Tat Ug11RP in Western blot, unlike the anti-Tat OYI and anti-Tat HXB2 sera (Fig. 4). The ELISA showed that the anti-Tat antibodies were able to recognize all the Tat variants tested; however, this was not found to be the case in the Western blot. This implies the presence of conformational epitopes. This result confirms the presence of a similar folding among the Tat variants. This is in agreement with the NMR studies of Tat Bru (8Péloponèse Jr., J.M. Gregoire C. Opi S. Esquieu D. Sturgis J. Lebrun E. Meurs E. Collette Y. Olive D. Aubertin A.M. Witvrow M.

Esquieu D. Opi S. Campbell G. Solomiac M. Lebrun E. Lebreton J. Loret E.P. Biopolymers. 2001; 62: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A circular dichroism (CD) study of Tat Oyi, Tat Bru, Tat Mal, and Tat Eli shows that these proteins have similar CD spectra and indicates that mutations in Tat Oyi preserve the regular folding of the Tat protein (31Péloponèse Jr., J.M.

Tat Mal and Tat Eli are both D-subtypes and have closely related sequences (29Alizon M. Wain-Hobson S. Montagnier L. Sonigo P. Cell. 1986; 46: 63-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The main difference between the three-dimensional structure of Tat Bru and Tat Mal is located in the glutamine-rich region that is a short α-helix in Tat Mal (9Gregoire C. Peloponese Jr., J.M. Esquieu D. Opi S. Campbell G. Solomiac M. Lebrun E. Lebreton J. Loret E.P. Biopolymers. 2001; 62: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and two β-turns in Tat Bru (8Péloponèse Jr., J.M. Gregoire C. Opi S. Esquieu D. Sturgis J. Lebrun E. Meurs E. Collette Y. Olive D. Aubertin A.M. Witvrow M. Pannecouque C., De Clercq E. Bailly C. Lebreton J. Loret E.P. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 2000; 323: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The presence of a similar α-helix in Tat Eli and Tat Ug11RP ended by a similar β-turn constituted by the PIP sequence, also present in Tat Mal, might explain the high antibody response of Tat Eli serum against Tat Ug11RP. Tat Oyi has a higher antibody response against non-homologous Tat variants compared with Tat HXB2 and Tat Eli. It is possible that this immune property induced a long term non-progressor phenotype for individuals infected with the HIV-1 Oyi strain. HIV-1 Oyi had a low virulence because the tat gene was defective, but patients infected with HIV-1 Oyi were protected against highly virulent D-subtypes (26Huet T. Dazza M.C. Brun-Vezinet F. Roelants G.E. Wain-Hobson S. AIDS. 1989; 3: 707-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the HIV-1 Oyi strain was classified as a B-subtype, Tat Oyi has sequence homology with other subtypes of Tat that are not found in a regular B-subtype of Tat, such as HXB2 (Fig.1). This study suggests also that the tertiary structure of Tat Oyi is critical to the induction of a broad and effective antibody response against Tat. It confirms that a similar folding exists among Tat variants, but the folding of Tat HXB2 and Tat Eli from rapid progressor patients did not induce a broad response against non-homologous Tat variants. The paradox is more striking between Tat HXB2 and Tat Oyi because despite 14 mutations Tat HXB2 was better recognized by anti-Tat Oyi serum compared with anti-Tat HXB2 serum. These mutations induce a better antibody response against Tat Oyi compared with Tat HXB2. Only six mutations (Ser-22, Leu-32, Thr-39, Asp-61, Ala-74, Glu-100) are not observed in the other Tat variants selected in Fig. 1. Tat Oyi mutants will allow the evaluation of the role of these residues in the antibody response. A vaccine made with Tat Oyi could be efficient against a wide range of HIV-1 strains found in Africa, Asia, and South America where a vaccine remains the only therapeutic alternative against AIDS. It is interesting to note that the prevalence of AIDS in Gabon is low in comparison with other subequatorial African countries (35Delaporte E. Janssens W. Peeters M. Buve A. Dibanga G. Perret J.L.

What is certainly more interesting is that the woman identified as Oyi was still alive in 1995 and gave birth to three children who are HIV negative. 3E. Delaporte, personal communication.

https://openalex.org/W2075134796,"C-myc availability is central for its ability to serve as a regulator of cell growth and death. Here we study the regulation of c-myc protein stability and identify domains of c-myc that are important for its stabilization in response to stress kinases activated following selective stress conditions. UV-irradiation elicited an increase in c-myc protein levels, which could be attenuated by inhibitors of stress kinases but also by actinomycin D-inhibitor of transcription. Inhibition of protein synthesis results in a noticeable decrease in c-myc levels, further pointing to the short half-life of the protein. However, in combination with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), cycloheximide efficiently increases steady-state levels of c-myc, suggesting that selective stress conditions are required to increase c-myc protein stability. Expression of MEKK1, an upstream regulator of protein kinases that has been implicated in mediating the response to diverse stress conditions, also results in an efficient increase in the half-life of c-myc protein. To map c-myc domains that are responsive to stress kinases, we monitored changes in the level of c-myc deletion mutants following MEKK1 expression. Of the seven c-myc deletion mutants analysed, the domain spanning amino acids 127–189 was found to be required for MEKK1-dependent increase in c-myc stability. In all, the present study identifies a novel domain that is important for the regulation of c-myc stability by stress kinases in response to selective stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2312821521,"Metastatic Lymph Node 51 (MLN51) cDNA was isolated by differential screening of a human breast cancer metastasis cDNA library. MLN51 cDNA encodes a novel human protein of 703 residues that shares no significant homology to any known protein. However MLN51 is well conserved between vertebrate and invertebrate species suggesting an important biological function. The amino terminal half of the protein contains a coiled-coil domain and two potential nuclear localization signals (NLS). The carboxy terminal half contains one SH2 and four SH3 binding motifs. The coiled-coil domain promotes MLN51 oligomerization in transfected cells. When transiently expressed, the MLN51 protein is mainly found in the cytoplasm with a weak nuclear staining. However, deletion of the carboxy terminal half of the protein allows the targeting of the protein to the nucleus, demonstrating that the NLSs are functional. MLN51 is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues. Human breast carcinomas show MLN51 overexpression in malignant epithelial cells. The uncommon association of protein-protein interaction domains often found either in nuclear or in cytoplasmic signaling proteins raises a possible nucleo-cytoplasmic function for MLN51."
https://openalex.org/W2082200691,"The carboxylic acid ionophore monensin, known as an electroneutral Na+ ionophore, an anticoccidial agent, and a growth-promoting feed additive in agriculture, is shown to be highly efficient as an ionophore for Pb2+ and to be highly selective for Pb2+ compared with other divalent cations. Monensin transports Pb2+ by an electroneutral mechanism in which the complex PbMonOH is the transporting species. Electrogenic transport via the species PbMon+ may also be possible. Monensin catalyzed Pb2+ transport is little affected by Ca2+, Mg2+, or K+concentrations that are encountered in living systems. Na+is inhibitory, but its effectiveness at 100 mm does not exceed ∼50%. The poor activity of monensin as an ionophore for divalent cations other than Pb2+ is consistent with the pattern of complex formation constants observed in the mixed solvent 80% methanol/water. This pattern also explains why Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ are ineffective as inhibitors of Pb2+ transport, but it does not fully explain the actions of Na+, where kinetic features of the transport mechanism may also be important. When given to rats at 100 ppm in feed together with Pb2+ at 100 ppm in drinking water, monensin reduces Pb accumulation in several organs and tissues. It also accelerates the excretion of Pb that was accumulated previously and produces this effect without depleting the organs of zinc or copper. Monensin, used alone or in combination with other agents, may be useful for the treatment of Pb intoxication. The carboxylic acid ionophore monensin, known as an electroneutral Na+ ionophore, an anticoccidial agent, and a growth-promoting feed additive in agriculture, is shown to be highly efficient as an ionophore for Pb2+ and to be highly selective for Pb2+ compared with other divalent cations. Monensin transports Pb2+ by an electroneutral mechanism in which the complex PbMonOH is the transporting species. Electrogenic transport via the species PbMon+ may also be possible. Monensin catalyzed Pb2+ transport is little affected by Ca2+, Mg2+, or K+concentrations that are encountered in living systems. Na+is inhibitory, but its effectiveness at 100 mm does not exceed ∼50%. The poor activity of monensin as an ionophore for divalent cations other than Pb2+ is consistent with the pattern of complex formation constants observed in the mixed solvent 80% methanol/water. This pattern also explains why Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ are ineffective as inhibitors of Pb2+ transport, but it does not fully explain the actions of Na+, where kinetic features of the transport mechanism may also be important. When given to rats at 100 ppm in feed together with Pb2+ at 100 ppm in drinking water, monensin reduces Pb accumulation in several organs and tissues. It also accelerates the excretion of Pb that was accumulated previously and produces this effect without depleting the organs of zinc or copper. Monensin, used alone or in combination with other agents, may be useful for the treatment of Pb intoxication. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid Ionophores are lipophilic chelating agents that transport cations across phospholipid bilayer membranes, such as the plasma and subcellular membranes of cells. The naturally occurring compounds (about 100) are antibiotics produced primarily by soil bacteria of theStreptomyces genus (1Prosser B.L.T. Palleroni N.J. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, New York1982: 21-42Google Scholar). They are distinguished from pore-forming antibiotics such as gramicidin by the involvement of a discrete complex in the transport mechanism. Thus, true ionophores can be highly selective for particular cations (2Taylor R.W. Kauffman R.F. Pfeiffer D.R. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, New York1982: 103-184Google Scholar, 3Painter G.R. Pressman B.C. Topics in Current Chemistry: Fortschritte der Chemischen Forschung. Springer-Verlag, New York1982: 88-110Google Scholar). The known compounds are generally divided into two groups: the so-called electrogenic and the electroneutral ionophores (4Dobler M. Ionophores and Their Structures. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 5-12Google Scholar, 5Westley J.W. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, New York1982: 1-20Google Scholar). Electrogenic ionophores are typified by the well known compound valinomycin (6Hladky S.B. Leung J.C.H. Fitzgerald W.J. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1758-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). They are neutral molecules that form cation complexes that carry a net positive charge, such that transbilayer charge movements accompany transport catalyzed by this class. Accordingly, the rate of transport is influenced by membrane electrical potential, which also determines the transmembrane distribution of the transported cation at equilibrium. Compounds such as monensin, nigericin, and A23187 (Fig.1) typify electroneutral ionophores, also called carboxylic acid or polyether ionophores. The anionic forms of these compounds complex the cation, which is exchanged for H+, or another cation, without net charge movement. Transport catalyzed by this class is therefore influenced by transmembrane pH gradients, as is the equilibrium distribution of cations.Among the carboxylic acid ionophores, it has been common to consider individual compounds as able to complex/transport a small group of cations having the same charge, with transport occurring through a single species by a mechanism that is purely electrogenic or electroneutral. Thus, monensin and nigericin were known as ionophores for Na+ and K+, respectively, with transport occurring via a 1:1 complex and electroneutral mechanism; A23187 was known as a Ca2+ ionophore transporting via a 1:2 complex and an electroneutral mechanism, and so forth. In work conducted over a period of time, we showed that the model depicted in Fig.2 is a more accurate representation of the factors that establish the transport properties of a carboxylic acid ionophore (7Taylor R.W.

The equilibrium shown at the top of Fig. 2 represents formation of 1:1 complexes and emphasizes that carboxylic acid ionophores react with a broad range of cations (n = 1–3), not just those with a particular charge as often assumed. The 1:1 complexes then react to form higher order species by competing equilibria I–III, which involve free ionophore (A−), hydroxide ion (OH−), and other anions (X−), respectively. Complexes of differing stoichiometry therefore arise, which include mixed species containing OH− and X−. Within this scheme, the mode and overall rate of transport will reflect the distribution of ionophore between these various complexes and their respective transmembrane diffusion constants. As a corollary of this interpretation, for a given ionophore and set of conditions, transport selectivity will also depend on how these factors vary with properties of the cation. The latter include size, charge, coordination and hydration number, preferred donor atom geometry, Lewis acidity, and ease of hydrolysis.Figure 2Equilibria between an ionized carboxylic acid ionophore (A −1 ), a metal cation of charge n+ (Mn+), and selected anions (A − , X − , and OH − ). Following formation of a 1:1 complex between the ionophore and a cation (MA n − 1), additional species can arise that may contribute to transport. In I, a 1:2 complex is formed by reaction with a second ionophore molecule. In II andIII, mixed complexes arise by reaction with OH−or another anion (X−), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In considering the above model, the characteristics of the donor atoms in typical ionophores, and the metal ion complexation properties of analogous synthetic polyethers (17Izatt R.M. Bradshaw J.S. Nielsen S.A. Lamb L.D. Christensen J.J. Chem. Rev. 1985; 85: 271-339Crossref Scopus (2075) Google Scholar), we realized that some of the antibiotic compounds might be efficient ionophores for Pb2+ and for other cations with biological toxicity. Subsequently, we showed that ionomycin transports Pb2+rapidly and with selectivity over Ca2+ near 103 when both cations are present simultaneously. Ionomycin was also found to affect an efficient transport of Pb2+ into cultured cells as well as to facilitate the depletion of Pb2+ when the cells had been previously loaded. We indicated that ionomycin should be considered primarily as an ionophore for Pb2+, rather than Ca2+, and suggested that its Pb2+-transporting activity might be adapted to improve existing treatments for Pb2+intoxication (15Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7071-7079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).In the present report, we extend the investigation of ionophore-mediated Pb2+ transport by demonstrating that monensin is also effective as a Pb2+ ionophore and is more selective in that regard than is ionomycin. We also show that monensin promotes the excretion of Pb2+ from rats when the cation has been previously provided in drinking water and the ionophore is administered in feed. Aspects of these data have been presented in abstract form (18Hamidinia S.A. Erdahl W.L. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (Abstr. 2748): 562Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONMonensin was among the first group of carboxylic acid ionophores to be discovered, a group that also includes dianemycin, nigericin, compound X-206, and lasalocid A (reviewed in Ref. 5Westley J.W. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, New York1982: 1-20Google Scholar). Soon after these compounds were reported to be potent anticoccidial agents (52Shumard R.F. Callender M.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1968; 1967: 369-377Google Scholar) and to derive this activity through a direct interaction with monovalent cations, leading to altered cation transport (53Estrada-O S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1968; 1967: 279-288Google Scholar). Among the monovalent alkali metal cations, monensin was subsequently shown to be most effective as an ionophore for Na+, and it has long been utilized as a research tool in that regard (reviewed in Refs. 2Taylor R.W. Kauffman R.F. Pfeiffer D.R. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, New York1982: 103-184Google Scholar and54Pressman B.C. Fahim M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 465-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It has also been used as a feed additive in agriculture, because of the anticoccidial activity and because it promotes the growth of several animal species that are used in that industry (55Raun A.P. Cooley C.O. Potter E.L. Rathmacher R.P. Richardson L.F. J. Anim. Sci. 1976; 43: 670-677Crossref Google Scholar, 56Ruff M.D. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, New York1982: 303-332Google Scholar).Relatively recent studies have shown that monensin also forms complexes with several divalent cations and that they are generally more stable than those formed with monovalent cations when compared in nonaqueous solvents such as methanol or diethylformamide (47Hoogerheide J.G. Popov A.I. J. Solution Chem. 1979; 8: 83-95Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 48Cox B.G. van Truong N. Rzeszotarska J. Schneider H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 5965-5969Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 57Hebrant M. Mimouni M. Tissier M. Pointud Y. Juillard J. Dauphin G. New J. Chem. 1992; 16: 999-1008Google Scholar, 58Mimouni M. Perrier S. Pointud Y. Juillard J. J. Solution Chem. 1993; 22: 769-785Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 59Mimouni M. Pointud Y. Juillard J. J. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1994; 131: 58-65Google Scholar). More limited data have furthermore shown that monensin displays some capacity to extract divalent cations from a bulk aqueous to a bulk organic phase (57Hebrant M. Mimouni M. Tissier M. Pointud Y. Juillard J. Dauphin G. New J. Chem. 1992; 16: 999-1008Google Scholar) and to convey these cations through three phase bulk solvent systems (60Tsukube H. Takagi K. Higashiyama T. Iwachido T. Hayama N. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 2984-2987Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and polyvinyl chloride membranes in ion-selective electrodes (61Suzuki K. Tohda K. Sasakura H. Inoue H. Tatsuta K. Shirai T. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1987; : 932-934Crossref Google Scholar, 62Suzuki K. Tohda K. Aruga H. Matsuzoe M. Inoue H. Shirai T. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 1714-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, previous studies have suggested that monensin might not be strictly an ionophore for monovalent cations, but they did not reveal that it is actually a highly selective and efficient ionophore for Pb2+ when phospholipid membranes are employed. That activity is newly discovered and is shown in the present report (Figs. 3 and 4).The stoichiometry of the complex that transports Pb2+ is clearly 1:1, ionophore/cation, based upon the relationships between log rate and log monensin or log Pb2+ concentration, which are both linear over a wide range and display slopes of 1.0 (Fig. 4). As illustrated in Fig. 10, the 1:1 complex PbMon+ may then be active as a transporting species and would function by an electrogenic mechanism. This type of mechanism may have contributed to the transport seen in Figs. 3 and 4, because valinomycin and CCCP were present during those experiments. Valinomycin and CCCP, acting together, are fully effective at collapsing an induced membrane potential in the present vesicle system (14Wang E. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1244-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Wang E. Erdahl W.L. Hamidinia S.A. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3275-3284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which is required for sustained electrogenic transport.Figure 10Potential mechanisms of monensin catalyzed Pb2+ transport. The curved linestogether represent a phospholipid bilayer, whereas the heavy arrows indicate transmembrane diffusion of a lead-monensin complex. The various species illustrated are assumed to be present near the membrane-bulk aqueous phase interface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)No provision was made to collapse membrane potential during the experiments reported in Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, so only electroneutral transport was contributing. The transporting species under those conditions is PbMonOH, as shown by the relationship between rate and external pH (Fig. 6) and by comparing that relationship to the distribution of Pb/monensin species that arises when the pH is varied (Fig. 5 C). PbMonOH can form by the pathways shown by Reaction 1 or 2, as further illustrated in Fig. 10, and both of these pathways can be considered to involve the acid ionization of a hydrating water molecule associated with Pb2+. Pb2++Mon−⇌PbMon++OH−⇌PbMonOH Pb2++OH−⇌PbOH++Mon−⇌PbMonOHReactions3 and 4The present data do not provide insight into which of the pathways may be the most significant, but that may not be a point of central interest, assuming that all equilibria shown in Fig. 10 remain at or near equilibrium during monensin-catalyzed Pb2+transport.Apart from the pathway forming PbMonOH, the extent of equilibration between reactants forming the transporting species is of interest when the origin of high selectivity for Pb2+transport is considered, compared with the transport of other divalent cations. If near equilibrium conditions are maintained, selectivity is expected to arise from differing complex stabilities, together with variation in the transmembrane diffusion constants of the various metal cation-monensin complexes. Several alkaline earth and first transition series divalent cations are poorly shielded when complexed by monensin (57Hebrant M. Mimouni M. Tissier M. Pointud Y. Juillard J. Dauphin G. New J. Chem. 1992; 16: 999-1008Google Scholar), a factor that reduces transmembrane diffusion constants. However, the role of differential shielding in establishing the selectivity of monensin as an ionophore for Pb2+ is uncertain, because shielding in Pb2+-monensin complexes has not been investigated.Regarding complex stabilities, the CaMon+ and the MgMon+ complexes are less stable than the PbMon+ complex by ∼4 orders of magnitude (Fig.5 B; Refs. 57Hebrant M. Mimouni M. Tissier M. Pointud Y. Juillard J. Dauphin G. New J. Chem. 1992; 16: 999-1008Google Scholar and 59Mimouni M. Pointud Y. Juillard J. J. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1994; 131: 58-65Google Scholar), and in addition, no interaction of these complexes with OH− was detected during the potentiometric titrations. The latter finding was expected, given the hydrolysis properties of these cations (63Baes Jr., C.F. Mesner R.F. The Hydrolysis of Cations. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar), but more importantly, these considerations further explain why monensin has little or no activity as an ionophore for Ca2+ (Fig. 3) and why neither Ca2+ nor Mg2+ is effective as an inhibitor of Pb2+ transport (Fig. 7). Likewise, Zn2+ is bound by monensin with low affinity compared with Pb2+, although the ZnMon+ and PbMon+ complexes bind OH− with similar affinities (Fig. 5 A). From those considerations, one might expect monensin to have some activity as an ionophore for Zn2+, and that was observed in the vesicle system (Fig. 3). Thus, relative complex stabilities clearly contribute to establishing the transport selectivity sequence seen in Fig. 3.On the other hand, Na+ is much less effective as an inhibitor of monensin-mediated Pb2+ transport than would be expected on the basis of complex stability constants alone, were near equilibrium maintained between monensin, OH−, and the two competing cations (Figs. 7 and 8). Thus, kinetic constants of the cation complexation/decomplexation reactions, transmembrane diffusion constants, or a differing tendency of Pb2+ and Na+ to accumulate at the membrane interface may contribute to the selectivity of monensin as an ionophore for Pb2+when significant concentrations of Na+ are also present.The current data obtained in model systems suggest that, like ionomycin (15Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7071-7079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), monensin might be useful in the treatment of lead intoxication; however, there are no studies that have tested that possibility in animals. Accordingly, we determined whether monensin alters the accumulation or distribution of lead when the two agents are given simultaneously and whether monensin affects the disposition of lead that was accumulated previously. The level of Pb2+ employed and the method of administration are typical of those used when investigating Pb toxicity in rats (64Cory-Slechta D.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 84-91PubMed Google Scholar, 65Gruber H.E. Gonick H.C. Khalil-Manesh F. Sanchez S.M. Motsinger S. Meyer M. Sharp C.F. Miner.

Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 159: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The level of monensin is the same as that usually given to chickens as an agricultural practice (56Ruff M.D. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, New York1982: 303-332Google Scholar) and is below the toxic threshold for monensin in rats (68Todd G.C. Novilla M.N. Howard L.C. J. Animal Sci. 1984; 58: 1512-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,69Bogden J.D. Gertner S.B. Kemp F.W. McLeod R. Bruening K.S. Chung H.R. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 3Consistent with the reports cited, we did not find a significant effect of monensin at 100 ppm on growth (weight gain) or on the consumption of feed and water. Monensin was administered as a component of feed, because that is the practice in agriculture and because activity upon oral administration is considered to be advantageous for agents used to treat lead intoxication.The data show that in both types of experiment monensin reduced the level of lead in several organs and tissues (Tables I andII). The design of studies that investigate the efficiency of agents used to treat lead intoxication varies widely, so it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of monensin with that of the traditional agents (e.g. EDTA and dimercaptosuccinate) in a succinct manner. Nevertheless, monensin appears to be similarly effective to these better investigated compounds (e.g. compare with Refs.70Hammond P.B. Aronson A.L. Olson W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1967; 157: 196-206PubMed Google Scholar, 71Pappas J.B. Ahlquist J.T. Allen E.M. Banner Jr., W. Toxicol. Appl.

Physiol. 1998; 25: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), although the dose employed here, the treatment interval, etc. have not been optimized. In addition, monensin reduces Pb in bone and brain, which is not true for the traditional compounds under some circumstances (64Cory-Slechta D.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 84-91PubMed Google Scholar, 73Cory-Slechta D.A. Weiss B. Cox C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 243: 804-813PubMed Google Scholar), and does not deplete the tissues of zinc and copper, which can occur as an unwanted side effect with some of the traditional compounds (74Perry Jr., H.M. Perry E.F. Clin. Invest. 1959; 38: 1452-1463Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 75Braide V.B. Gen. Pharmacol. 1984; 15: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 76Kostial K.

Thus, monensin may indeed be useful for promoting the elimination of lead from animals.At this early stage, it is appropriate to consider the possibility than monensin acts differently than the traditional compounds as regards the mechanism by which lead excretion occurs. The traditional compounds are hydrophilic cation chelators that circulate in blood and form Pb2+ complexes having stability constants of ∼1015 and higher. They are not membrane-permeant and are excreted together with Pb2+, typically via the kidney. The lead-monensin complex is much less stable (K = 107.25 in 80% methanol/water) and has little solubility in an aqueous environment. Moreover, the complex easily crosses a phospholipid membrane, whereas Pb excretion occurs primarily via the colon. Thus, monensin may act primarily by transporting Pb out of cells, where it eventually returns to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted by a normal mechanism, possibly involving the enterohepatic circulation. Since monensin is highly active as an ionophore for Na+ as well as for Pb2+, its presence will couple the gradients of these two cations across cell membranes, providing a driving force for Pb transport out of the cell. Overall, this potential mechanism suggests that the application of monensin, together with a hydrophilic chelator, might be particularly effective at promoting the excretion of Pb from animals. That possibility is currently under investigation. Ionophores are lipophilic chelating agents that transport cations across phospholipid bilayer membranes, such as the plasma and subcellular membranes of cells. The naturally occurring compounds (about 100) are antibiotics produced primarily by soil bacteria of theStreptomyces genus (1Prosser B.L.T. Palleroni N.J. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, New York1982: 21-42Google Scholar). They are distinguished from pore-forming antibiotics such as gramicidin by the involvement of a discrete complex in the transport mechanism. Thus, true ionophores can be highly selective for particular cations (2Taylor R.W. Kauffman R.F. Pfeiffer D.R. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores.

Springer-Verlag, New York1982: 88-110Google Scholar). The known compounds are generally divided into two groups: the so-called electrogenic and the electroneutral ionophores (4Dobler M. Ionophores and Their Structures. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 5-12Google Scholar, 5Westley J.W. Polyether Antibiotics: Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores. Marcel Dekker, New York1982: 1-20Google Scholar). Electrogenic ionophores are typified by the well known compound valinomycin (6Hladky S.B. Leung J.C.H. Fitzgerald W.J. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1758-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). They are neutral molecules that form cation complexes that carry a net positive charge, such that transbilayer charge movements accompany transport catalyzed by this class. Accordingly, the rate of transport is influenced by membrane electrical potential, which also determines the transmembrane distribution of the transported cation at equilibrium. Compounds such as monensin, nigericin, and A23187 (Fig.1) typify electroneutral ionophores, also called carboxylic acid or polyether ionophores. The anionic forms of these compounds complex the cation, which is exchanged for H+, or another cation, without net charge movement. Transport catalyzed by this class is therefore influenced by transmembrane pH gradients, as is the equilibrium distribution of cations. Among the carboxylic acid ionophores, it has been common to consider individual compounds as able to complex/transport a small group of cations having the same charge, with transport occurring through a single species by a mechanism that is purely electrogenic or electroneutral.

In this complex, the β2-β3 loop protrudes through the 10-nucleotide RNA loop. Shortening of the RNA loop strongly perturbs binding, suggesting that an optimal “fit” of the β2-β3 loop into the RNA loop is an important factor in complexation. To understand this interaction further, we mutated or deleted loop residues Lys50and Met51, which protrude centrally into the RNA loop but do not make any direct contacts to the bases. Using BIACORE, we analyzed the ability of these U1A mutants to bind to wild type RNAs, or RNAs with shortened loops. Alanine replacement mutations only modestly affected binding to wild type U1hpII. Interestingly, simultaneous replacement of Lys50 and Met51 with alanine appeared to alleviate the loss of binding caused by shortening of the RNA loop. Deletion of Lys50 or Met51 caused a dramatic loss in stability of the U1A·U1hpII complex. However, deletion of both residues simultaneously was much less deleterious. Simulated annealing molecular dynamics analyses suggest this is due to the ability of this mutant to rearrange flanking amino acids to substitute for the two deleted residues. The double deletion mutant also exhibited substantially reduced negative effects of RNA loop shortening, suggesting the rearranged loop is better able to accommodate a short RNA loop. Our results indicate that one of the roles of the β2-β3 loop is to provide a steric fit into the RNA loop, thereby stabilizing the RNA·protein complex.

RNA recognition motif ribonucleoprotein RNA binding domain The RNA recognition motif (RRM),1 also known as theribonucleoprotein (RNP) consensus domain or RNA binding domain (RBD), is the most common and best characterized RNA binding domain. It is present in one or more copies in hundreds of RNA binding proteins (1Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 2Varani G. Nagai K. Annu. Rev.

Proteins carrying RRM domains play critical roles in a wide variety of cellular processes, including RNA processing and packaging, mRNA export, translation, and RNA degradation. RRM domains are about 90 amino acids long and fold into a globular structure consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (the RNA binding surface) backed by two α-helices (see Fig. 1, A and B). RRM domains are characterized by the presence of two highly conserved stretches of 8 and 6 amino acids, known as the RNP1 and RNP2 consensus sequences (see Fig. 1A). These consensus sequences lie strategically in the center of the β-sheet surface and contain conserved aromatic residues critical for RNA binding (2Varani G. Nagai K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

To explain the preference of PGK forl- over d-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates, the kinetics of their phosphorylation were compared with the dephosphorylation of the respective triphosphates using recombinant human PGK. The results attributed favorable phosphorylation ofl-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates by PGK to differences in kcat, which were consequences of varied orientations of the sugar and diphosphates in the catalytic site of PGK. The amino acids involved in the catalytic reaction of PGK (including Glu344, Lys220, and Asn337) were therefore mutated. The impact of mutations on the phosphorylation of l- and d-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates was different from those on dephosphorylation of the respective triphosphates. This suggested that the interactions of the nucleoside analogs with amino acids during the transition state are different in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. Thus, reversible action of the enzyme may not involve the same configuration of the active site. Furthermore, the amino acid determinants of the action of PGK for l-deoxynucleotides were not the same as for the d-deoxynucleotides.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35999-36008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is also expressed in the nuclei where it modulates DNA synthesis and repair (19Vishwanatha J.K.

Since PGK in nuclei retains its ability to bind to its natural substrates, it has been proposed that its activity in nuclei may be regulated by the energy state of the cell (21Popanda O. Fox G. Thielman H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 102-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Extracellular PGK was recently shown to have a thiol-reductase activity (22Lay A.J. Jiang X.M. Kister O. Flynn E. Underwood A. Condron R. Hogg P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Reduction of plasmin by PGK results in proteolysis of plasmin to angiostatin fragments, which are inhibitors of angiogenesis (23Cao R., Wu, H.L. Veitonmaki N. Linden P. Farnebo J. Shi G.Y. Cao Y.

ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate could inhibit reduction of plasmin, presumably through inducing a conformational change that was not favorable to the reduction of plasmin (25Lay A.J. Jiang X.M. Daly E. Sun L. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9062-9068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This suggested that the level of nucleoside diphosphates or triphosphates (natural or otherwise) might have a regulatory impact on the multiple cellular functions of PGK. The sequences of mammalian PGKs are conserved over 96%, and there is also a high level of tertiary structure homology (26Mori N. Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. FEBS Lett. 1986; 20: 313-317Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of horse muscle PGK in binary complex with 3-phosphoglycerate (27Harlos K. Vas M. Blake C.F. Proteins. 1992; 12: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and pig muscle PGK in binary and ternary complexes with 3-phosphoglycerate and nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP have been resolved (28Merli A.

All of the amino acids in the active site are conserved among horse muscle PGK, pig muscle PGK, and human PGK. In this study the amino acids in the catalytic site of human PGK have been extrapolated from the model proposed by May et al. (29May A. Vas M. Harlos K. Blake C. Proteins. 1996; 24: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which was based on the crystal structure of pig muscle PGK in ternary complex with AMP-PNP and 3-phosphoglycerate. The modified catalytic reaction is shown in Fig. 1. PGK comprises of a single subunit with two domains; the N-terminal domain has a basic patch region (rich in arginines and histidines) for binding to 1,3-biphosphoglycerate (or 3-phosphoglycerate), and the C-terminal domain contains the nucleotide-binding site. The nucleobase binds to a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the C terminus of the enzyme. The sugar is stacked on the pyrollidine ring of Pro339, and both hydroxyl groups on the ribose hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of Glu344. The oxygen on the α-phosphate interacts with Lys220, and the oxygen on the β-phosphate (or the bridge oxygen between β- and γ-phosphates) hydrogen bonds to Asn337. Asn337 also forms a hydrogen bond with the amino group of Lys220 and helps to stabilize its ion pair interaction with α-phosphate of the nucleotide (28Merli A. Szilagyi A.N. Flachner B. Rossi G.L. Vas M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29May A. Vas M. Harlos K. Blake C. Proteins. 1996; 24: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Szilagi A.N. Ghosh M. Garman E. Vas M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 depicts the catalytic reaction of PGK with ATP as the substrate and 3-phosphoglycerate as the phosphate acceptor. Enzyme-substrate(s) interactions induce a conformational change in PGK resulting in the reduction of distance between the N- and C-terminal domains for associative phosphate transfer. The γ-phosphate is then in the proximity of Arg39, and additional interaction of bridge oxygen between β- and γ-phosphate with Asn337creates a positive charge on the phosphorus atom of γ-phosphate, facilitating nucleophilic attack by 3-phosphoglycerate. This disturbs the coordination of the metal ion and its linkage with α-, β-, and γ-phosphates and results in interaction of metal ion with Asp375 and α- and β-phosphates. This leads to the collapse of the transition state to form metal-ADP and 1,3-biphosphoglycerate complexes bound to PGK, which then reverses the conformational change and releases the products (27Harlos K. Vas M. Blake C.F. Proteins. 1992; 12: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Merli A. Szilagyi A.N. Flachner B. Rossi G.L. Vas M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29May A. Vas M. Harlos K. Blake C. Proteins. 1996; 24: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As with any reversible enzyme it is generally assumed that the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP using 1,3-biphosphoglycerate as a phosphate donor would also go through a similar transitional state (ED* =EP*). To understand the preference of PGK forl-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates over theird-deoxynucleoside analog counterparts, the kinetics of their phosphorylation were compared with the kinetics of dephosphosphorylation of the respective triphosphates using recombinant human PGK. The preference observed was further explained through kinetic analysis of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of nucleoside analog diphosphates and triphosphates by single amino acid mutants of PGK. These included mutations of PGK at Glu344, Lys220, and Asn337, all of which are involved in hydrogen bonding with the sugar and phosphate side chain of nucleoside analog diphosphates or triphosphates during the catalytic reaction. Nucleoside analogs l-FMAUDP, d-FMAUDP,l-SddCDP, β-l(−)-dioxolanecytidine DP, l-ddCDP, β-d-2′,3′-dideoxycytidine DP, l-FMAUTP, d-FMAUTP, andl-SddCTP were synthesized according to the following procedure (which is a modification of the protocol published by Ruth and Cheng (31Ruth J.L. Cheng Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 415-422PubMed Google Scholar)). Nucleoside analogs were dissolved in trimethylphosphate (10 μl/mg of nucleoside) for 10 min at −10 °C. Phosphooxychloride (10 equivalents of trimethylphosphate) was added at the same temperature to generate nucleoside analog monophosphates. Ten parts of the mixture of 2 mmol of phosphoric acid (inN, N-dimethylformamide) and 6 mmol of tributylamine were added to the solution containing nucleoside analog monophosphates. This resulted in the stepwise synthesis of nucleoside analog diphosphates and triphosphates. The reactions were stopped after 1 h by neutralization of the mixture with NaOH to obtain the maximum yields of both diphosphates and triphosphates (with time the nucleoside analog diphosphates are also converted to triphosphates). Nucleoside analog diphosphates and triphosphates were purified using DEAE Sephadex A-25 (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with step gradients between 0 and 300 mm KCl. The purity of the respective nucleoside analog diphosphates and triphosphates was confirmed by HPLC (Shimadzu, Braintree, MA) in a binary gradient of water and 0.3 m potassium phosphate buffer using an anion exchange column (Partisil-SAX, Whatman, Inc., Clifton, NJ). All of the other nucleoside analog diphosphates and triphosphates included in this study were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells (human hepatoma) using TRIzol and reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot of cDNA was amplified using DNA polymerase and specific primers for human PGK, including 5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GTC GCT TTC TAA CAA GCT GAC G, and 5′-CGC GGA TCC CTA AAT ATT GCT GAG AGC ATC CAC. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes, ligated with NdeI-BamHI-digested pET28a bacterial expression vector (the sequence of PGK was confirmed by DNA sequencing), and transfected into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The resulting PGK was an N-terminal histidine fusion protein, which was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column according to the manufacturer's protocol. Single amino acid mutations of the wild-type PGK-pET28a plasmid were carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The specific primers (and their complimentary oligomers) used were 40–50-mer, and the positions for the beginning and end of primers and the base pairs around the site of mutation (shown in bold type) are listed: (i) E344A, 5′-1006GTA TTT GCG TGG GAA1049; (ii) K220A, 5′-635GCA GACGCG ATC CAG681; (iii) K220R, 5′-635GCA CAG CGT ATC CAG681; (iv) N337D, 5′-987GTG TGG GAC GGT CCT1035; and (v) N337Q, 5′-987GTG TGGCAG GGT CCT1035. The sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant enzymes were purified using the same method as for the wild-type enzyme. Phosphorylation of nucleoside analog diphosphates by PGK and the mutant enzymes was evaluated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 4 mmNAD+, and 4 mmdl-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. 1,3-Biphosphoglycerate, the phosphate donor for the reaction, was generated 10 min prior to the inclusion of PGK or mutant enzymes, by the addition of 0.5 units/0.1 ml of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (16Krishnan P., Fu, Q. Lam W. Liou J.Y. Dutschman G. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of nucleoside analog triphosphate by PGK or the mutant enzymes was evaluated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 mm 3-phosphoglycerate. All of the samples were incubated at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped on ice, and the samples were deproteinized by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The samples were then extracted in a mixture of trioctylamine and 1,1,3-trichlorotrifluoroethane in a ratio of 45:55. The diphosphate and triphosphate forms of nucleoside analogs were analyzed by HPLC as described above. The Km and kcat values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots. All of the values shown in Table I, Table II, Table III, Table IV, Table V, Table VI are the means and standard deviations from at least three independent experiments.Table VIDephosphorylation of nucleoside analog triphosphates by N337D and N337QN337DN337QKmkcatKmkcatμmmin−1μmmin−1ATP61.7 ± 8.77.8 ± 0.9 (8.0)67.4 ± 17.23.5 ± 0.6 (3.6)dATP68.8 ± 11.99.2 ± 0.9 (5.1)88.6 ± 20.54.2 ± 0.4 (2.3)TTP78.0 ± 3.28.7 ± 1.8 (8.2)61.2 ± 4.83.1 ± 0.2 (2.9)d-FMAUTP30.3 ± 1.110.1 ± 1.8 (6.3)29.6 ± 3.83.6 ± 0.1 (2.2)l-FMAUTP123.4 ± 4.40.3 ± 0.04 (1.2)111.6 ± 33.60.3 ± 0.04 (1.2)CTP127.5 ± 26.53.4 ± 0.2 (7.4)102.9 ± 2.91.0 ± 0.1 (2.2)dCTP94.8 ± 9.13.3 ± 0.1 (8.1)89.3 ± 0.71.3 ± 0.07 (3.2)ddCTP287.5 ± 10.73.0 ± 0.9 (3.3)600.4 ± 11.62.7 ± 0.4 (3.0)l-SddCTP—6-akcat lower than 0.04 min−1, which is the limit for detection by HPLC.—6-akcat lower than 0.04 min−1, which is the limit for detection by HPLC.—6-akcat lower than 0.04 min−1, which is the limit for detection by HPLC.—6-akcat lower than 0.04 min−1, which is the limit for detection by HPLC.6-a kcat lower than 0.04 min−1, which is the limit for detection by HPLC.

Open table in a new tab The Km and kcat values of nucleoside analog diphosphates for recombinant human PGK are shown in Table I. This included diphosphates ofl-deoxynucleoside analogs and d-ribonucleoside,d-deoxynucleoside, and d-dideoxynucleoside analogs. As shown in Table I, the nucleobase did not have a major impact on binding; the Km values of all of the purine and pyrimidine analog diphosphates were within a 3-fold range. The kcat for purines, represented by ADP, which is the natural substrate of the enzyme, were higher than those of pyrimidines, as represented by TDP and CDP. In addition, within the same base, the kcat ford-ribonucleoside was greater thand-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates. Phosphorylation of dCDP and ddCDP was below the experimental levels of detection. Comparison of d-FMAUDP with l-FMAUDP and comparison of ddCDP with l-ddCDP andl-SddCDP showed that favorable phosphorylation ofl-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates could be attributed to their higher kcat values. This implied that both the base and the sugar moieties of nucleosides had an impact on the transitional state of enzyme in binding nucleoside analog diphosphates, thereby affecting the efficiency of phosphate transfer. The effects of γ-phosphate of nucleoside analog triphosphates on Km and the rate of dephosphorylation were evaluated, and the results are shown in Table II. The nucleobase had no significant impact on the Km value, however, theKm values for nucleoside analog triphosphates were 5–8-fold lower than those of the respective diphosphates. Thekcat values for dephosphorylation ofd-ribonucleoside and l-deoxynucleoside analog triphosphates examined were 100–1000-fold lower than that for the phosphorylation of the respective diphosphates. Thekcat values for all of the nucleoside analog triphosphates were, however, similar, indicating that the base configuration of sugar and the presence or absence of 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups had no impact on the rate of phosphate transfer. Interestingly, the kcat value for dephosphorylation of dCTP and ddCTP was better than thekcat value for phosphorylation of the respective diphosphates. The ratios of the efficiency of dephosphorylation of nucleoside analog triphosphates and the efficiency of phosphorylation of the respective diphosphates (derived from Table I) are also shown in Table II. Phosphorylation of the diphosphates of ribonucleosides andl-deoxynucleoside analogs were favored at least a 100-fold over the dephosphorylation of the respective triphosphates. This implied that phosphorylation of l-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates would not be limited by dephosphorylation of the triphosphates generated during the reaction. Phosphorylation ofd-FMAUDP and TDP were favored only by 2–10-fold over the dephosphorylation of the respective triphosphates. These results supported the observation that favorable phosphorylation ofl-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates as compared with the corresponding d-nucleoside analogs were due to differences in the kcat value. The 2′,3′-hydroxyl groups, which hydrogen bond to Glu344, had an impact on the phosphorylation of nucleoside analog diphosphates (Table I). To evaluate the role of Glu344 in the orientation of nucleoside analog diphosphates in the catalytic site, glutamic acid was replaced with alanine. TheKm and kcat values for E344A are shown in Table III. The values in parentheses show the changes in Km and kcat in comparison with the wild-type PGK. As expected, the kcat value ford-ribonucleoside analogs ADP (over 10-fold) and CDP (at least 1000-fold) decreased significantly. Thekcat value for the d-deoxynucleoside analogs TDP and d-FMAUDP increased slightly, similar to that of l-dideoxynucleoside analog, l-SddCDP, whereas l-FMAUDP remained unaffected. There were no discernible patterns in the changes associated with theKm values. These results indicated that the hydrogen bonds between ribonucleoside diphosphates and the carboxyl group of Glu344 are important for the optimal orientation of the substrate in the catalytic site for efficient phosphate transfer. In the analogs lacking either or both 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups, substitution with alanine at position 344 had no significant effect on the rate of phosphorylation. Lys220 and Asn337stabilize the phosphate side chain by forming hydrogen bonds with oxygen on α-phosphate and β-phosphate, respectively. These amino acids are therefore directly involved in the interactions with diphosphates or triphosphates of nucleotides in transition state. Lys220 was replaced with alanine (to abolish hydrogen bonding) and with arginine (to evaluate the steric impact), and Asn337 was replaced with aspartate (to abolish hydrogen-bonding) and glutamine (to study the steric impact). TheKm and kcat values are shown in Table IV, and the values in parentheses represent the changes with respect to the wild-type PGK. The rate of phosphorylation of diphosphates of cytidine analogs by both Lys220 and Asn337 mutants decreased to less than 0.04 mi"

https://openalex.org/W1979807786,"The human parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor (hPTH1R), containing a 9-amino acid sequence of rhodopsin at its C terminus, was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and solubilized with 0.25% n-dodecyl maltoside. Approximately 18 μg of hPTH1R were purified to homogeneity per mg of crude membranes by single-step affinity chromatography using 1D4, a monoclonal antibody to a rhodopsin epitope. The N terminus of the hPTH1R is Tyr23, consistent with removal of the 22-amino acid signal peptide. Comparisons of hPTH1R by quantitative immunoblotting and Scatchard analysis revealed that 75% of the receptors in membrane preparations were functional; there was little, if any, loss of functional receptors during purification. The binding affinity of the purified hPTH1R was slightly lower than membrane-embedded hPTH1R (Kd = 16.5 ± 1.3versus 11.9 ± 1.9 nm), and the purified receptors bound rat [Nle8,21,Tyr34]PTH-(1–34)-NH2(PTH-(1–34)), and rat [Ile5,Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(5–36)-NH2with indistinguishable affinity.

Finally, PTH stimulated [35S]GTPγS incorporation into Gαs in a time- and dose-dependent manner, when recombinant hPTH1R, Gαs-, and βγ-subunits were reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. The methods described will enable structural studies of the hPTH1R, and they provide an efficient and general technique to purify proteins, particularly those of the class II G protein-coupled receptor family. The human parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor (hPTH1R), containing a 9-amino acid sequence of rhodopsin at its C terminus, was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and solubilized with 0.25% n-dodecyl maltoside. Approximately 18 μg of hPTH1R were purified to homogeneity per mg of crude membranes by single-step affinity chromatography using 1D4, a monoclonal antibody to a rhodopsin epitope. The N terminus of the hPTH1R is Tyr23, consistent with removal of the 22-amino acid signal peptide. Comparisons of hPTH1R by quantitative immunoblotting and Scatchard analysis revealed that 75% of the receptors in membrane preparations were functional; there was little, if any, loss of functional receptors during purification. The binding affinity of the purified hPTH1R was slightly lower than membrane-embedded hPTH1R (Kd = 16.5 ± 1.3versus 11.9 ± 1.9 nm), and the purified receptors bound rat [Nle8,21,Tyr34]PTH-(1–34)-NH2(PTH-(1–34)), and rat [Ile5,Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(5–36)-NH2with indistinguishable affinity. Maximal displacement of125I-PTH-(1–34) binding by rat [α−aminoisobutyric acid (Aib)1,3,Nle8,Gln10,Har11,Ala12,Trp14,Arg19,Tyr21]PTH-(1–21)-NH2and rat [Aib1,3,Gln10,Har11,Ala12,Trp14]PTH-(1–14)-NH2of 80 and 10%, respectively, indicates that both N-terminal and juxtamembrane ligand binding determinants are functional in the purified hPTH1R. Finally, PTH stimulated [35S]GTPγS incorporation into Gαs in a time- and dose-dependent manner, when recombinant hPTH1R, Gαs-, and βγ-subunits were reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles.

The molecular mechanisms that underlie PTH1R function are of high interest because of their physiological and pathophysiological importance, and because the PTH1R is a target for drugs to treat osteoporosis. Hyperparathyroidism, a disease due to overproduction of PTH, leads to hypercalcemia and bone loss, but PTH, when administered to both animals and humans at specified doses and schedules, increases bone mass (4Tam C.S.

FuGENE 6 and n-dodecyl maltoside (DM) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; β-d-glucopyranosides (n-hexyl, -septyl, -octyl, -nonyl, -decyl, and -dodecyl) were purchased from Calbiochem; CHAPS, CHAPSO, digitonin, and sodium cholate were purchased from Sigma; and Na125I (2125 Ci/mmol), [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol), and [3H]1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (DPPC, 76 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphate were obtained as chloroform solutions (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL). Other reagents of the highest purity available were obtained from Fisher. Baculoviral vectors encoding recombinant G proteins, αs-, hexahistidine-tagged αs-, β1-, γ2-, and hexahistidine-tagged γ2-subunits, were generous gifts from Dr. Henry R. Bourne (University of California, San Francisco). The monoclonal antibody, 1D4, which recognizes the rhodopsin epitope, TETSQVAPA (82Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), was purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). G48, a polyclonal antiserum raised in a sheep, contains antibodies that recognize epitopes within the sequences of the rat PTH1R, YPESKENKDVPTGSRRRGRPC, FCNGEVQAEIRKSWSRWTLAL and SGLDEEASGSARPPPLLQEGWETVM. The first sequence is located in the N-terminal ectodomain, and the last two sequences are located in the intracellular C-terminal tail of the receptor. For some experiments recognition of G48 was restricted to epitopes in the C-terminal tail by immuno-depletion using YPESKENKDVPTGSRRRGRPC coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, following a protocol provided by the manufacturer. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA), supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Sf9 cells (1.5 × 106 cell/ml) (Invitrogen) were cultured in 500 or 900 ml of TNM-FH Insect Medium (BD PharMingen) in 1- or 2-liter spinner flasks (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) in a humidified atmosphere containing 100% air at 27 °C. Mutations were introduced into the hPTH1R by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Five amino acids in exon 2 of the hPTH1R were replaced with the corresponding amino acids from the rat PTH1R (E92K, D94N, E96D, A97V, and Y103R) to allow efficient detection by G48 of hPTH1Rs expressed on the cell surface. The 27-mer encoding the epitope (TETSQVAPA), recognized by 1D4, was inserted in-frame immediately upstream of the stop codon at the 3′-end of the hPTH1R sequence. The modified hPTH1R cDNA was subcloned at BamHI and XbaI sites in a pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The accuracy of the modified receptor construct was confirmed by sequencing the entire receptor (Tufts University, Department of Physiology, Sequencing Core Facility, Boston). All plasmid DNAs were prepared using the EndoFree plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and stored at −20 °C in sterile buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Transfection of COS-7 cells with purified plasmid containing the modified hPTH1R cDNA was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents. In brief, 10 μg of DNA in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was mixed with 30 μl of FuGENE 6 for 20 min at 21 °C, and the mixture was added to 60–75% confluent COS-7 cells in a 15-cm dish. Cells were harvested after 72 h for preparation of membranes. For studies of hPTH1R on intact cells, COS-7 cells were grown in 24-well plates and transfected with 250 ng of cDNA and 0.75 μl of FuGENE 6 per well. Cells were studied 72 h after transfection. Confluent monolayers of COS-7 cells, grown in 15-cm dishes, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping with a Teflon policeman in 5 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl and 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), containing proteinase inhibitors (10 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) (Sigma). Then, cell lysates were homogenized by 30 strokes with a Duall tissue grinder (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). The homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g (Beckman J2–21 centrifuge, JLA rotor, Beckman Instruments, Berkeley, CA) for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and debris. Supernatants were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were aspirated, and the membrane-enriched pellets were suspended in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, pH 7.5) with the same proteinase inhibitors at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. Receptors in these crude membrane preparations were stable for at least 1 month under these conditions. The membrane proteins were diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml with Buffer B and were then solubilized by incubation with an equal volume of 0.5% DM in Buffer B (45 min, 4 °C). A small amount of insoluble material was separated from the clear supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (Beckman L8–55M, 70.1 TI rotor, Beckman Instruments, Berkeley, CA). The supernatant, diluted 2-fold with Buffer B, was added to 1 ml of Sepharose 4B to which 1D4 had been coupled using CNBr and was placed on a rocker platform for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The solution and resin then were transferred to Bio-Rad Econo column (0.7 × 5 cm, Bio-Rad), and the resin was washed with 50 ml of Buffer B containing 0.05% DM, and the hPTH1R was eluted by competition with the 9-amino acid rhodopsin peptide (100 μm, 2 ml of Buffer B containing 0.05% DM). Affinity-purified hPTH1R was concentrated ∼25-fold on Microcon YM-50 filters (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 40 min and hydrolyzed for 24 h at 110 °C in 6N HCl containing 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol. The hydrolysate was vacuum-dried and re-dissolved in a citrate buffer, and amino acid analysis was performed on a Beckman System 6300 analyzer. Quantification was made after correction for the 9-amino acid rhodopsin epitope. The same preparation was then used to develop a standard to rapidly assess receptor concentration and recovery by Western blotting. Purified hPTH1R (1.9 μg) was dissolved in 250 μl of Buffer B containing 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and serially diluted over a range of 1:25 (1.5 ng) to 1:3200 (11.8 pg) in the same buffer. Standards were established by “slot-blotting” 5 μl of each dilution onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Dot SF apparatus, Bio-Rad) and stored for future use. Samples of solubilized crude membrane and purified hPTH1R at several dilutions in Buffer B containing 0.05% DM were then applied to the nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked by treatment with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dry milk and 0.2% Tween 20 and then were incubated with 1D4 antibody for 1 h at room temperature (RT). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was then added, and membranes were developed using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The concentration of hPTH1R was determined by interpolation from the intensities of the serially diluted standard. Purified hPTH1R was concentrated 25-fold on Microcon YM-50 membranes and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%). The ∼80-kDa protein then was electrotransfered to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stained with Ponceau S. T"

Caspases are thus processed to form active heterodimeric enzymes by cleavage between their large and small subunits and by the removal of their prodomain (reviewed in Ref. 1Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The proteolytic maturation of procaspase-3 is not only performed by initiator caspases-8 and -9, but also by granzyme (Gr)1 B, the most abundant serine protease contained in the lytic granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). GrB cleaves after Asp residues, preferentially at the IEXD↓X sequence, as shown in vitro (2Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Accordingly, once introduced into a target cell, GrB is able to cleave procaspase-3 (3Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) between the large and small subunits, at the IETD↓S activation site, which is also recognized by caspase-8 (4Fernandez-Alnemri T. Amstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that stimulation of primary T lymphocytes through the CD2 receptor leads to partial processing of procaspases-3 and -7, as defined by cleavage between the large and small subunits, without removal of the prodomain (6Déas O. Dumont C. MacFarlane M. Rouleau M. Hebib C. Harper F. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Cohen G.M. Senik A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3375-3383PubMed Google Scholar). This was true for cells with a high mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and no surface phosphatidylserine residues, two well known indicators of cell viability. Also, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, an indicator substrate for these caspases, was not cleaved. This implies that although the cleaved caspases were potentially active at this stage of processing (7Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L.C. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), they were inhibited by an endogenous inhibitor, probably the X-linked IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) protein (8Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Concentrating on caspase-3, we obtained similar results after CD3 stimulation of primary T cells in the presence of IL-2. This prompted us to identify the protease(s) in cause.We found that partial procaspase-3 cleavage preferentially occurred in a portion of nonapoptotic (ΔΨmhigh) activated CD8+ but not CD4+ T lymphocytes. It was not prevented by Boc-D.fmk, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, but it was prevented by GF.dmk, a selective inhibitor of DPPI (also called cathepsin (Cat) C). The data presented in this study collectively point to a granule-associated serine protease whose activation is strictly dependent on DPPI activity and that exhibits a specific p20/p12 pattern of aspase activity toward procaspase-3, likely GrB. The involvement of granule exocytosis was excluded because patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) or with perforin deficiency also displayed partial processing of procaspase-3. Small amounts of GrB were indeed exported from cytolytic granules to the cytosol of a significant fraction of GrB-positive cells, suggesting an internal way of action.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of DPPI, an enzyme required for the activation of myeloid and lymphoid granule-associated serine proteases, prevents the partial processing of procaspase-3 proenzyme that occurs in CD3-activated human CD8+ T lymphocytes. We favor the notion that the serine protease responsible for this type of processing is a GrB-like protease, likely GrB itself, and that this protease is exported from lytic granules to the cytosol by an internal mechanism. These conclusions are based on four lines of argument: 1) Boc-D.fmk, a broad spectrum inhibitor of caspase activity devoid of nonspecific side effects, did not prevent the partial processing of the caspase-3 proenzyme. In contrast, GF.dmk, a specific and irreversible inhibitor of DPPI, was effective, as well as Z-AAD.cmk, which directly inhibits GrB-like serine proteases. 2) In CD4+ T cells costimulated in culture with CD8+T cells, the caspase-3 proenzyme remained intact. 3) CD8+ T cells from CHS and perforin-deficient patients had the same fate as normal CD8+ T cells, despite the impairment of the perforin/granzyme-based exocytosis pathway. 4) Small amounts of GrB (but not of GrA or Cat B) were found in the cytosol of nonapoptotic activated CD8+ T cells (ΔΨmhigh, with cytochrome c and AIF displaying a mitochondrial distribution pattern) in at least 18% of activated CD8+ T cells expressing GrB.In a stimulation system quite similar to ours, others observed that full blown activation of caspases-3, -6, -7, and -8 occurred in actively proliferating T cell populations, even when they were depleted by the sorting of dying annexin-V-positive cells (17Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sékaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In contrast, by selecting ΔΨmhigh CD8+ T cells, we only observed partial processing of procaspase-3. We have shown that phosphatidylserine exposure (detected by annexin-V) is a rather late apoptotic event that occurs downstream of ΔΨm loss, concomitantly with caspase activation (9Dumont C. Dürrbach A. Bidère N. Rouleau M. Kroemer G. Bernard G. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Susin S.A. Senik A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the use of CD8+ T differently engaged in the commitment phase to apoptosis may explain these discrepancies. Although we did not examine the executioner caspase-7, our previous results indicated that it was also partially processed in ΔΨmhighactivated T cells, at a cleavage site compatible with that of apical caspases and GrB (6Déas O. Dumont C. MacFarlane M. Rouleau M. Hebib C. Harper F. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Cohen G.M. Senik A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3375-3383PubMed Google Scholar) and hence probably subjected to the same protease as procaspase-3. In agreement with previous studies (17Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sékaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we found that Z-VAD.fmk inhibited both caspase activation and T cell proliferation. However, Z-FA.fmk, a frequently used Cat B and L inhibitor, had the same inhibitory effect when added at the very beginning of the culture period. In fact, Z-VAD.fmk efficiently blocks Cat B, which is a lysosomal housekeeping cysteine protease (35Schotte P. Declercq W. Van Huffel S. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. FEBS Let. 1999; 442: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It may also facilitate the death of activated T cells located at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (36Lüschen S. Ussat S. Scherer G. Kabelitz D. Adam-Klages S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24670-24678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that possibly occurred at background levels in our system. As to Z-FA.fmk, it can behave in certain systems as a potent inhibitor of NF-κB gene expression (37Schotte P. Schauvliege R. Janssens S. Beyaert R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21153-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and hence affect T cell proliferation in our experimental conditions. In contrast, Boc-D.fmk had little effect on T cell proliferation (Fig. 3) or GrB expression (not shown). Nevertheless, Boc-D.fmk prevented the caspase-dependent maturation of the large subunit of caspase-3 to its p17 form. These data assessed the specific caspase blocking capacity of Boc-D.fmk in our system. This part of our work not only questioned the notion that caspase activity is required for the initiation of T cell proliferation (17Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sékaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) but also indicated that a noncaspase protease was responsible for the partial procaspase-3 processing occurring in activated CD8+ T cells.Selective inhibition of DPPI activity by GF.dmk prevented this type of processing. DPPI is a thiol protease with aminodipeptidase activity required for the activation of many granule-associated serine proteases. In T lymphocytes, it is predominantly located in the cytolytic granules of CTL (27Brown G.R. McGuire M.J. Thiele D.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4733-4742PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mabee C.L. McGuire M.J. Thiele D.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5880-5885PubMed Google Scholar), where it performs the proteolytic maturation/activation of proGrA and proGrB (13Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar, 23McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kumer J.A. Kamp A.M.

A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that a granule-associated serine protease dependent on DPPI activity was in charge of procaspase-3 processing. Cytolytic granules from human cytotoxic T lymphocytes express four serine proteases called granzymes: GrB, which cleaves after Asp residues (Aspase); GrA and tryptase 2, which cleave after Arg or Lys; and GrH, a chymase that cleaves after Phe (reviewed in Ref. 38Smyth M.J. Kelly J.M. Sutton V.R. Davis J.E. Browne K.A. Sayers T.J. Trapani J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 18-28PubMed Google Scholar). To date, only GrA and GrB have been reported to be activated by DPPI. The partial cleavage pattern of procaspase-3 in CD8+ T cells perfectly matched the IETD↓S activation site recognized by GrB, suggesting that the protease in cause was GrB. The serine protease inhibitor Z-AAD.cmk, whose preferred substrate at low concentrations is GrB (31Kam C.M. Hudig D. Powers J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), also inhibited the processing of procaspase-3 at 12.5 μm, corroborating this conclusion.The likely involvement of GrB in the partial processing of procaspase-3 raises two questions: 1) Why was the caspase-3 proenzyme initially targetted? 2) Why was Bid not cleaved to its pro-apoptotic tBid fragment? Procaspase-3 is in fact much more vulnerable in vitro to GrB than to the upstream caspase-9 (7Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L.C. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A.

In cells treated with GrB and defective adenovirus, caspase-3 is activated before caspases-8 and -9 (39Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Janicke R.U. Srinivasan A. Seth P. Salvesen G.S.

Thus, it is conceivable that small amounts of GrB, delivered to the cytosol of activated CD8+ T cells, could preferentially interact with procaspase-3. Cytochrome c release, one major consequence of tBid translocation to the outer membrane of mitochondria, was not observed either. Bid can be cleaved at different sites by caspase-8 (40Li H.

However, it has been reported that tBid protein generated by caspase-8 activity in intact cells does not accumulate but is instead very rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteolytic system (46Breischopf K. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21648-21652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this view, it is possible that small amounts of tBid generated in activated CD8+ T cells might also be degraded in this way.The partial processing of procaspase-3 also seen in patients with CHS or with perforin deficiency precluded the involvement of granule exocytosis for the delivery of the responsible granule serine protease. Part of GrB was indeed found into the cytosol, outside the cytolytic granules of a significant proportion (∼20%) of GrB-positive ΔΨmhigh CD8+ T cells. The fact that neither Cat B nor GrA was released in significant amounts implies that this mechanism does not involve the generalized rupture of lysosomal membranes at the stage of T cell activation examined. There is increasing evidence that some lysosomal proteases are specifically relocated from lysosomes to the cytosol, acting as death mediators in several models of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 47Leist M.

Our results indicate for the first time that GrB may, in certain circumstances, be relocated from lytic granules to cytosol. The partial processing of procaspase-3, seen at day 3 of the culture period, is likely an early apoptotic event, held in check by endogenous IAPs. Further accumulation of GrB into the cytosol might irrevocably lead to cell death. This possibility is currently being examined. Caspase-3 belongs to a family of cytosolic cysteine proteases that are synthesized as proenzymes and are converted during apoptosis into mature enzymes that can cleave crucial death substrates immediately downstream from Asp residues. Caspases are thus processed to form active heterodimeric enzymes by cleavage between their large and small subunits and by the removal of their prodomain (reviewed in Ref. 1Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The proteolytic maturation of procaspase-3 is not only performed by initiator caspases-8 and -9, but also by granzyme (Gr)1 B, the most abundant serine protease contained in the lytic granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). GrB cleaves after Asp residues, preferentially at the IEXD↓X sequence, as shown in vitro (2Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Accordingly, once introduced into a target cell, GrB is able to cleave procaspase-3 (3Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) between the large and small subunits, at the IETD↓S activation site, which is also recognized by caspase-8 (4Fernandez-Alnemri T. Amstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We have previously shown that stimulation of primary T lymphocytes through the CD2 receptor leads to partial processing of procaspases-3 and -7, as defined by cleavage between the large and small subunits, without removal of the prodomain (6Déas O. Dumont C. MacFarlane M. Rouleau M. Hebib C. Harper F. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Cohen G.M. Senik A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3375-3383PubMed Google Scholar). This was true for cells with a high mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and no surface phosphatidylserine residues, two well known indicators of cell viability. Also, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, an indicator substrate for these caspases, was not cleaved. This implies that although the cleaved caspases were potentially active at this stage of processing (7Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L.C. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), they were inhibited by an endogenous inhibitor, probably the X-linked IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) protein (8Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Concentrating on caspase-3, we obtained similar results after CD3 stimulation of primary T cells in the presence of IL-2. This prompted us to identify the protease(s) in cause. We found that partial procaspase-3 cleavage preferentially occurred in a portion of nonapoptotic (ΔΨmhigh) activated CD8+ but not CD4+ T lymphocytes. It was not prevented by Boc-D.fmk, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, but it was prevented by GF.dmk, a selective inhibitor of DPPI (also called cathepsin (Cat) C). The data presented in this study collectively point to a granule-associated serine protease whose activation is strictly dependent on DPPI activity and that exhibits a specific p20/p12 pattern of aspase activity toward procaspase-3, likely GrB. The involvement of granule exocytosis was excluded because patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) or with perforin deficiency also displayed partial processing of procaspase-3. Small amounts of GrB were indeed exported from cytolytic granules to the cytosol of a significant fraction of GrB-positive cells, suggesting an internal way of action. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of DPPI, an enzyme required for the activation of myeloid and lymphoid granule-associated serine proteases, prevents the partial processing of procaspase-3 proenzyme that occurs in CD3-activated human CD8+ T lymphocytes. We favor the notion that the serine protease responsible for this type of processing is a GrB-like protease, likely GrB itself, and that this protease is exported from lytic granules to the cytosol by an internal mechanism. These conclusions are based on four lines of argument: 1) Boc-D.fmk, a broad spectrum inhibitor of caspase activity devoid of nonspecific side effects, did not prevent the partial processing of the caspase-3 proenzyme. In contrast, GF.dmk, a specific and irreversible inhibitor of DPPI, was effective, as well as Z-AAD.cmk, which directly inhibits GrB-like serine proteases. 2) In CD4+ T cells costimulated in culture with CD8+T cells, the caspase-3 proenzyme remained intact. 3) CD8+ T cells from CHS and perforin-deficient patients had the same fate as normal CD8+ T cells, despite the impairment of the perforin/granzyme-based exocytosis pathway. 4) Small amounts of GrB (but not of GrA or Cat B) were found in the cytosol of nonapoptotic activated CD8+ T cells (ΔΨmhigh, with cytochrome c and AIF displaying a mitochondrial distribution pattern) in at least 18% of activated CD8+ T cells expressing GrB.In a stimulation system quite similar to ours, others observed that full blown activation of caspases-3, -6, -7, and -8 occurred in actively proliferating T cell populations, even when they were depleted by the sorting of dying annexin-V-positive cells (17Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sékaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In contrast, by selecting ΔΨmhigh CD8+ T cells, we only observed partial processing of procaspase-3. We have shown that phosphatidylserine exposure (detected by annexin-V) is a rather late apoptotic event that occurs downstream of ΔΨm loss, concomitantly with caspase activation (9Dumont C. Dürrbach A. Bidère N. Rouleau M. Kroemer G. Bernard G. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Susin S.A. Senik A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the use of CD8+ T differently engaged in the commitment phase to apoptosis may explain these discrepancies. Although we did not examine the executioner caspase-7, our previous results indicated that it was also partially processed in ΔΨmhighactivated T cells, at a cleavage site compatible with that of apical caspases and GrB (6Déas O. Dumont C. MacFarlane M. Rouleau M. Hebib C. Harper F. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Cohen G.M. Senik A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3375-3383PubMed Google Scholar) and hence probably subjected to the same protease as procaspase-3. In agreement with previous studies (17Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sékaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we found that Z-VAD.fmk inhibited both caspase activation and T cell proliferation. However, Z-FA.fmk, a frequently used Cat B and L inhibitor, had the same inhibitory effect when added at the very beginning of the culture period. In fact, Z-VAD.fmk efficiently blocks Cat B, which is a lysosomal housekeeping cysteine protease (35Schotte P. Declercq W. Van Huffel S. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. FEBS Let. 1999; 442: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It may also facilitate the death of activated T cells located at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (36Lüschen S. Ussat S. Scherer G. Kabelitz D. Adam-Klages S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24670-24678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that possibly occurred at background levels in our system. As to Z-FA.fmk, it can behave in certain systems as a potent inhibitor of NF-κB gene expression (37Schotte P. Schauvliege R. Janssens S. Beyaert R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21153-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and hence affect T cell proliferation in our experimental conditions. In contrast, Boc-D.fmk had little effect on T cell proliferation (Fig. 3) or GrB expression (not shown). Nevertheless, Boc-D.fmk prevented the caspase-dependent maturation of the large subunit of caspase-3 to its p17 form. These data assessed the specific caspase blocking capacity of Boc-D.fmk in our system. This part of our work not only questioned the notion that caspase activity is required for the initiation of T cell proliferation (17Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sékaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp.

DPPI is a thiol protease with aminodipeptidase activity required for the activation of many granule-associated serine proteases. In T lymphocytes, it is predominantly located in the cytolytic granules of CTL (27Brown G.R. McGuire M.J. Thiele D.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4733-4742PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mabee C.L. McGuire M.J. Thiele D.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5880-5885PubMed Google Scholar), where it performs the proteolytic maturation/activation of proGrA and proGrB (13Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar, 23McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kumer J.A. Kamp A.M.

A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that a granule-associated serine protease dependent on DPPI activity was in charge of procaspase-3 processing. Cytolytic granules from human cytotoxic T lymphocytes express four serine proteases called granzymes: GrB, which cleaves after Asp residues (Aspase); GrA and tryptase 2, which cleave after Arg or Lys; and GrH, a chymase that cleaves after Phe (reviewed in Ref. 38Smyth M.J. Kelly J.M. Sutton V.R. Davis J.E. Browne K.A. Sayers T.J. Trapani J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 18-28PubMed Google Scholar). To date, only GrA and GrB have been reported to be activated by DPPI. The partial cleavage pattern of procaspase-3 in CD8+ T cells perfectly matched the IETD↓S activation site recognized by GrB, suggesting that the protease in cause was GrB. The serine protease inhibitor Z-AAD.cmk, whose preferred substrate at low concentrations is GrB (31Kam C.M. Hudig D. Powers J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), also inhibited the processing of procaspase-3 at 12.5 μm, corroborating this conclusion.The likely involvement of GrB in the partial processing of procaspase-3 raises two questions: 1) Why was the caspase-3 proenzyme initially targetted? 2) Why was Bid not cleaved to its pro-apoptotic tBid fragment? Procaspase-3 is in fact much more vulnerable in vitro to GrB than to the upstream caspase-9 (7Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L.C. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), caspase-8, and caspase-10 (5Stennicke H.R. Jürgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In cells treated with GrB and defective adenovirus, caspase-3 is activated before caspases-8 and -9 (39Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Janicke R.U. Srinivasan A. Seth P. Salvesen G.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34278-34283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that small amounts of GrB, delivered to the cytosol of activated CD8+ T cells, could preferentially interact with procaspase-3. Cytochrome c release, one major consequence of tBid translocation to the outer membrane of mitochondria, was not observed either. Bid can be cleaved at different sites by caspase-8 (40Li H.

However, it has been reported that tBid protein generated by caspase-8 activity in intact cells does not accumulate but is instead very rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteolytic system (46Breischopf K. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21648-21652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this view, it is possible that small amounts of tBid generated in activated CD8+ T cells might also be degraded in this way.The partial processing of procaspase-3 also seen in patients with CHS or with perforin deficiency precluded the involvement of granule exocytosis for the delivery of the responsible granule serine protease. Part of GrB was indeed found into the cytosol, outside the cytolytic granules of a significant proportion (∼20%) of GrB-positive ΔΨmhigh CD8+ T cells. The fact that neither Cat B nor GrA was released in significant amounts implies that this mechanism does not involve the generalized rupture of lysosomal membranes at the stage of T cell activation examined. There is increasing evidence that some lysosomal proteases are specifically relocated from lysosomes to the cytosol, acting as death mediators in several models of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 47Leist M.

The serine protease inhibitor Z-AAD.cmk, whose preferred substrate at low concentrations is GrB (31Kam C.M. Hudig D. Powers J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), also inhibited the processing of procaspase-3 at 12.5 μm, corroborating this conclusion. The likely involvement of GrB in the partial processing of procaspase-3 raises two questions: 1) Why was the caspase-3 proenzyme initially targetted? 2) Why was Bid not cleaved to its pro-apoptotic tBid fragment? Procaspase-3 is in fact much more vulnerable in vitro to GrB than to the upstream caspase-9 (7Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L.C. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A.

In cells treated with GrB and defective adenovirus, caspase-3 is activated before caspases-8 and -9 (39Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Janicke R.U. Srinivasan A. Seth P. Salvesen G.S.

Thus, it is conceivable that small amounts of GrB, delivered to the cytosol of activated CD8+ T cells, could preferentially interact with procaspase-3. Cytochrome c release, one major consequence of tBid translocation to the outer membrane of mitochondria, was not observed either. Bid can be cleaved at different sites by caspase-8 (40Li H.

However, it has been reported that tBid protein generated by caspase-8 activity in intact cells does not accumulate but is instead very rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteolytic system (46Breischopf K. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21648-21652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this view, it is possible that small amounts of tBid generated in activated CD8+ T cells might also be degraded in this way. The partial processing of procaspase-3 also seen in patients with CHS or with perforin deficiency precluded the involvement of granule exocytosis for the delivery of the responsible granule serine protease. Part of GrB was indeed found into the cytosol, outside the cytolytic granules of a significant proportion (∼20%) of GrB-positive ΔΨmhigh CD8+ T cells. The fact that neither Cat B nor GrA was released in significant amounts implies that this mechanism does not involve the generalized rupture of lysosomal membranes at the stage of T cell activation examined. There is increasing evidence that some lysosomal proteases are specifically relocated from lysosomes to the cytosol, acting as death mediators in several models of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 47Leist M.

Our results indicate for the first time that GrB may, in certain circumstances, be relocated from lytic granules to cytosol. The partial processing of procaspase-3, seen at day 3 of the culture period, is likely an early apoptotic event, held in check by endogenous IAPs. Further accumulation of GrB into the cytosol might irrevocably lead to cell death. This possibility is currently being examined.

https://openalex.org/W2068489515,"Abstract Previously, we showed that increased extracellular tonicity promotes increased type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A) expression through a p38 MAPKβ pathway in inner medullary collecting duct cells. The endothelial and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS and iNOS respectively) genes are also expressed in this nephron segment and are thought to play a role in regulating urinary sodium concentration. We sought to determine whether changes in tonicity might regulate NOS gene expression, and if so, whether these latter changes might be linked mechanistically to the increase in NPR-A gene expression. Increased extracellular tonicity effected a time-dependent reduction in eNOS and iNOS protein levels, eNOS mRNA levels, and eNOS gene promoter activity over the first 8 h of the incubation. Although levels of the eNOS mRNA and promoter activity had returned to normal after 24 h, eNOS protein levels remained low at 24–36 h, and recovery was not complete even at 48 h. The decrease in eNOS expression was signaled in large part through a p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism. Reduction in eNOS expression together with the concomitant decline in intracellular cyclic GMP levels appears to account for a significant portion of the p38 MAPK-dependent osmotic stimulation of NPR-A gene expression noted previously. Collectively, these findings support the existence of a complex regulatory circuitry in the cells of the inner medullary collecting duct linking two independent cyclic GMP-generating signal transduction systems involved in regulation of urinary sodium concentration."

However, how dynamitin is involved in cell adhesion is unclear despite the fact that both MacMARCKS and microtubules regulate β2integrin activation. We report that dynamitin regulates β2 integrin avidity toward iC3b by modulating the lateral mobility of β2 integrin molecules. Using the single particle tracking method, we found that integrin molecular mobility in cells expressing the fusion protein CFP (cyan fluorescent protein)-dynamitin or CFP-MB (the MacMARCKS binding domain peptide of dynamitin) increased 6-fold over the control cells, suggesting that disturbing dynamitin function dramatically altered the cytoskeletal constraint on β2 integrin molecules. Further mechanistic studies revealed that overexpression of dynamitin stimulated the phosphorylation of endogenous MacMARCKS protein, which lead to the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. This effect of dynamitin correlates with the observation that higher concentration of PKC inhibitor is required to block β2 integrin mobility in dynamitin-expressing cells. Although dynamitin acts at the point of MacMARCKS phosphorylation, it is upstream of RhoA, because its effect was blocked by RhoA inhibitor. Thus, we conclude that dynamitin is a part of the cytoskeletal constraint that locks β2integrin in the inactive form.

Although lacking β2 integrin-mediated adhesion causes leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (6Anderson D.C. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), many autoimmune diseases are associated with excessive integrin-mediated cell adhesion (7Arao T. Morimoto I. Kakinuma A. Ishida O.

In the case of β2integrin, its ligand-binding activity on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane is tightly regulated by a number of intracellular signals originating from other membrane receptors (for review see Ref.9Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar) such as T cell receptors or chemokine receptors (10Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is termed “inside-out” signaling (11Dustin M.L. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of inside-out signaling is not clearly understood, both protein kinase C (PKC)1 and cytoskeleton are involved (for review, see Refs. 9Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

In resting leukocytes, β2 integrin molecules are immobilized on the cell membrane in a diffused distribution, because they are constrained by cytoskeletal complex (13Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L.

Activating PKC causes the cytoskeleton to relax, which sets integrin molecules into a faster and freer diffusion mode, close to completely free diffusion (13Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T.

Enhanced mobility of integrin and the presence of ligands facilitate integrin molecules to form clusters (14Lub M. Van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Patches of clustered integrin can be clearly observed on the activated cell membrane (16Van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Such clustering further enhances the avidity of integrin toward its ligands. Thus, the enhancement in the mobility of integrin molecules on the membrane is regarded as the initial event of integrin activation. A number of cytoskeleton components are involved in regulating integrin activation. The most apparent of these is actin microfilament. Its depolymerization caused by low dose cytochalasin D promotes lateral mobility of integrin molecules as well as β2 integrin-mediated adhesion (13Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J.

The PKC signal, via the phosphorylation of its substrate MacMARCKS, is also a key regulator of the cytoskeletal constraint on integrin molecules (13Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J.

In addition to microfilament and its associated proteins, a recent report has also placed microtubule in the cytoskeletal constraint of integrin (25Zhou X., Li, J. Kucik D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44762-44769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has long been observed that disrupting microtubule affects cell spreading (26Ivanova O.Y. Margolis J.M. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand I.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 101: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27De Brabander M., De Mey J. Ven de Veire R. Aerts F. Geuens G. Cell Biol. Int.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Particularly in macrophages, depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole causes the spreading macrophages to retract quickly into a spherical shape (29Cheung H.T. Terry D.S. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1980; 4: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Kinesin, the plus end-directed microtubule-dependent motor protein, has also been implicated in cell spreading (28Rodionov V.I.

Recently, observations showed that growing microtubules are targeted toward the focal contacts and promote the dissociation of these complexes (30Bershadsky A. Chausolvsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A.

Microtubules affect not only cell spreading via focal contacts but also the molecular activation of integrin (25Zhou X., Li, J. Kucik D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44762-44769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Kadi A. Pichard V. Lehmann M. Briand C. Braguer D. Marvaldi J. Rognoni J.B. Luis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that microtubule is a major player in the cytoskeletal constraint on integrin molecules (25Zhou X., Li, J. Kucik D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44762-44769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Disturbing microtubule dynamics, either by depolymerizing microtubules with nocodazole or by polymerizing microtubules with taxol, induces enhanced integrin molecular mobility on the cell membrane and leads to enhanced integrin-ligand interaction (25Zhou X., Li, J. Kucik D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44762-44769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There are many possible mechanisms for microtubules to be involved in regulating the cytoskeletal constraint on β2 integrin molecules. Small GTP-binding proteins are clearly involved in the microtubule-dependent integrin activation and cell spreading (34Waterman-Storer C.M. Worthylake R.A. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Salmon E.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 35Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 36Laudanna C.

Commun. 1998; 5: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the involvement of microtubule-associated proteins, particularly the role of microtubule-motor proteins. One such protein is dynamitin, a subunit of dynactin complex. The dynactin complex is an important regulator of dynein, a microtubule-dependent minus end-directed motor protein (reviewed in Refs. 38Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 6: 212-215Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This complex consists of as many as 10 subunits: p150Glued/p135Glued doublet, p62, dynamitin (p50), Arp1 (actin-related protein 1), actin, actin-capping protein α subunit, actin-capping protein β subunit, p27, and p24 (for review see ref. 41Schroer T.A. Bingham J.B. Gill S.R. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 6: 212-215Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is believed to be involved in the progressivity of motor protein (42King S.J. Schroer T.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and in bridging microtubule motor protein to cargo membrane (38Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Through its N-terminal domain, dynamitin protein interacts with MacMARCKS (43Yue L., Lu, S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol.

However, cell spreading is a complicated process involving many steps starting with integrin activation, extracellular matrix organization, and ending with focal adhesion remodeling. It is not known at which step during cell spreading that dynamitin regulates cell spreading. Considering that (1Stewart M. Thiel M. Hogg N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) dynamitin interacts with MacMARCKS (43Yue L., Lu, S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol.

Here we report that disruption of dynamitin function indeed directly stimulates integrin avidity as measured by its ligand binding. Furthermore, we found that the increased avidity is likely the result of the disruption of cytoskeletal constraint on integrin molecules and subsequent enhancement of integrin molecular mobility, which is linked to PKC and Rho GTPase in the signal transduction pathway leading to integrin activation. RAW 264.7 cells and 293 cells were purchased from ATCC (MD). Hybridoma HB 226, which produces hamster anti-mouse β2 integrin antibody (2E6), and hybridoma TIB 112, which produces mouse IgM anti-sheep erythrocytes (S–S.3), were also purchased from ATCC and were grown in serum-free media from Invitrogen. Monoclonal anti-MHC-II antibody was kindly provided by Dr. R. Steinman (Rockefeller University, New York, NY). DMEM and other cell culture media were also purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-paxillin antibody was purchase from BD Bioscience. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. cDNA-encoding dynamitin was obtained as described previously (43Yue L., Lu, S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol.

Rabbit anti-green fluorescence protein polyclonal antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Goat anti-dynamitin antiserum was generated using purified glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein of dynamitin at Ferrell Farms (Oklahoma City, OK). Sheep erythrocytes were also purchased from Ferrell Farms. The carboxylated fluorescent latex beads were purchased from Molecular Probe (Cat no. F-8811).

SuperFect transfection reagents were purchased from Qiagen. The coding region of dynamitin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the 5′-primer, 5′-GGA CTC GGA TCC CCG GAA TTC-3′, and the 3′-primer, 5′-CTG TTC TCC GGA TCC CAA ATG-3′, using wild type dynamitin in pGEX plasmid (43Yue L., Lu, S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as template. The primers contained aBamHI site for easy cloning into pECFP-C1 downstream of CFP. “CFP-dynamitin” indicates that the CFP is at the N terminus of dynamitin. cDNA-coding MacMARCKS binding domain (MB) of dynamitin was generated in the same way with primer pair 5′-primer, 5′-ATA AGC TTG GAT CCA TGG-3′, and the 3′-primer, 5′-TAG GAT CCA GAT TCA TAT CCT GTC-3′. The sequences of all polymerase chain reaction products were confirmed before use. The dynamitin plasmids (2 μg) described above were transfected into 5 × 105 RAW cells or into 5 × 105293 cells using the SuperFect liposome method as described in the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). The RAW cells were analyzed by single particle tracking and Western blot 16 h after transfection. RAW cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Before the experiment, 5 × 105 cells in a 35-mm dish were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once and then treated with neuraminidase X (1 milliunit in 3 ml of buffer containing 0.13m NaCl, 0.05 m NaAc, pH 6.5) for 20 min. Then 0.5 ml of the cell suspension was added to 2.5 ml of Hanks’ solution and plated onto an acid-washed coverslip coated with poly-l-lysine (13Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 47Wright S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 204-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Antibody against β2 integrin (2E6) either in the form of whole antibody or Fab fragments at a concentration of 3 μg/μl was conjugated to the carboxylated beads according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes). Because no difference between Fab-conjugated and whole antibody-conjugated beads was observed in single particle tracking (15Zhou X. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the whole antibody-coated beads were used in most cases. In a glass tube, 100 μl of antibody (3 μg/μl) or BSA was added to the reaction mixture containing 50 μl of MES (200 mm), 50 μl of H2O, and 200 μl of carboxylated latex beads and left at room temperature for 15 min. Then 2 mg of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide was added to the tube, which was vortexed for 2 h at room temperature. At the end of 2 h, 450 μl of glycine (1 m, pH 6.25) was added, and the tube was vortexed for an additional 30 min to terminate the reaction. The excess proteins were removed by dialyzing the reaction mixture in a dialyzing bag (molecular weight cutoff, 300,000) against 1 liter of 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) overnight. The buffer was then changed to PBS by dialyzing the beads against 1 liter of PBS for another 4 h. The beads were stored at 4 °C in 1.5 ml of PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.02% azide. The size of the beads, 200 nm, is below the resolution of a light microscope. However, with video contrast enhancement, a shadow at the size of 800 nm, similar to most intracellular organelles, can be seen. Because the microbeads we used have autofluorescence, the beads were illuminated at the end of the experiments for their fluorescence so that they would not be confused with the subcellular organelles. Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in a steel chamber and placed on a water-jacked heating stage on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope with minimum light to prevent “burning” the cells. On poly-l-lysine-coated surfaces in the serum-free medium, all types of cells we used adhered and spread equally well (data not shown). After the cells spread and clearly showed their lamellipodia, the anti-β2 integrin antibody (2E6)-conjugated beads were added at a concentration of four to five beads per cell. Recording started and continued for 30 s as soon as the 2E6-conjugated beads fell onto and bound to the cells. Beads coated with BSA or antibody against MHC II were used as controls. Bead motion was observed using video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. A charge-coupled device camera system (Optronic DE750) with digital contrast enhancement and a Pentium IV 1.4-GHz computer with 512 MB of RAM recorded the beads’ motion directly into RAM at a rate of 30 frames per second. For each track, a 36-s segment was recorded using PIXCI software (Epix Inc., IL) and transferred later to a hard drive. The Location of the beads was determined automatically in each video frame for 15 s, i.e. 450 frames, using in-house-generated software. For each track of a bead, the mean square displacement (MSD) for each time interval was calculated from thexy coordinates of the particles according to Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3(for review see Ref. 48Qian H. Sheetz M.P. Elson E.L. Biophys.

Complement iC3b-coated sheep erythrocytes (EiC3b) were prepared as described (47Wright S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 204-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, sheep erythrocytes (E) were washed twice in saline, twice in EDTA/GVB (10 mm EDTA in GVB:5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl with 0.05% gelatin), and three times in DGVB2+ (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5% dextrose, 0.05% gelatin, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mmCaCl2). To obtain IgM-coated E (EIgM), 2 × 109 E in EDTA/GVB were incubated with an equal volume of culture supernatant of hybridoma TIB 112 containing mouse anti-sheep erythrocytes IgM, 30 min at 37 °C and 30 min at 0 °C. After three washes in DGVB2+, EIgM were incubated with C5-deficient human serum (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 60 min at 37 °C and was ready to be used after three DGVB2+ washes. RAW cells were plated on six-well plates with 5 × 105cells and cultured overnight, then transfected with CFP-dynamitin, CFP-MB, and CFP separately. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were incubated with EiC3b (2 × 108) for 30 min. For positive and negative control, untransfected cells were treated with or without PMA, respectively, for 25 min while incubating with Eic3b. The cells were either fixed for photography or lysed for further analysis of hemoglobin content. Raw cells were transfected as described above. Four hours into transfection, the transfection media were replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. At this time, the cells were split into two parts: one medium contained 1 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme and the other contained none. After 16 h of further incubation, the cells were subjected to single particle tracking analysis. Cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected as described in the previous section. After 16 h, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold Tris-HCl lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Paxillin was immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μg of anti-paxillin antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by a 1:1 mixture of 50% slurry of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membrane and probed with 4G10, an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Later, the membrane was stripped and probed again for paxillin to show the amount of paxillin in each lane. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were labeled with [32P]Pi (500 μCi/60-mm dish) for 2 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS. The cells were then lysed in the lysis buffer (49Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and MacMARCKS protein was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-MacMARCKS antibody (50Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2327142738,"The transcription factor E2F1 functions as a key regulator for both cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. Mdm2, a major cellular regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, is also closely involved in cell cycle and apoptosis. In addition to regulation of p53, Mdm2 has been reported to stimulate E2F1 transactivation by a mechanism that remains unclear. Here we examined how overexpression of Mdm2 alters E2F1/DP1 transactivation. Using a set of cell lines with differing p53 and Rb status we determined that Mdm2 induction of E2F1 transactivation was p53-dependent, resulting from release of repression by p53. While Mdm2 association with p53 was required to increase E2F1 transactivation, Mdm2 mediated degradation of p53 was not. p53 repression of E2F1 transactivation required a functional DNA binding and transactivation domain. Consistent with Mdm2 activation of E2F1 via an inhibition of p53 transactivation we demonstrate a concomitant reduction in p21 protein levels with Mdm2 overexpression. Furthermore, E2F1 repression by an Rb-phosphorylation mutant could not be reversed by Mdm2 overexpression. Mdm2 was also unable to enhance E2F1 transactivation in Mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking p21. Taken together, these results suggest that Mdm2 activation of E2F1 occurs through the repression of p53-dependent transcription of p21, a p53-target gene and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2324943279,"Activated versions of the similar GTPases, H-Ras and R-Ras, have differing effects on biological phenotypes: Activated H-Ras strongly transforms many fibroblast cell lines causing dramatic changes in cell shape and cytoskeletal organization. In contrast, R-Ras transforms fewer cell lines and the transformed cells display only some of the morphological changes associated with H-Ras transformation. H-Ras cells can survive in the absence of serum whereas R-Ras cells seem to die by an apoptotic-like mechanism in response to removal of serum. H-Ras can suppress integrin activation and R-Ras specifically antagonizes this effect. To map sequences responsible for these differences we have generated and investigated a panel of H-Ras and R-Ras chimeras. We found that the C-terminal 53 amino acids of R-Ras were necessary and sufficient to specify the contrasting biological properties of R-Ras with respect to focus morphology, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reversal of H-Ras-induced integrin suppression. Surprisingly, we found chimeras in which the focus formation and integrin-mediated phenotypes were separated, suggesting that different effectors could be involved in mediating these responses. An integrin profile of H-Ras and R-Ras cell pools showed no significant differences; both activated H-Ras and R-Ras expressing cells were found to have reduced β1 activity, suggesting that the activity state of the β1 subunit is not sufficient to direct an H-Ras transformed cell morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2116986119,"Production of the two mRNAs encoding distinct forms of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase depends on processing that involves the recognition of alternative poly(A) sites and an internal 5′-splice site located within the first 3′-terminal exon. The resulting 1.6- and 1.8-kb mRNAs are expressed in fibroblast cell lines, whereas lymphoblastoid B cells, such as Daudi, produce only the 1.8-kb mRNA. In the present study, we have shown that the 3′-end processing at the last 3′-terminal exon occurs independently of the core poly(A) site sequence or the presence of regulatory elements. In contrast, in Daudi cells, the recognition of the poly(A) site at the first 3′-terminal exon is impaired because of an unfavorable sequence context. The 3′-end processing at this particular location requires a strong stabilization of the cleavage/polyadenylation factors, which can be achieved by the insertion of a 25-nucleotide long U-rich motif identified upstream of the last poly(A) site. Consequently, we speculate that in cells expressing the 1.6-kb mRNA, such as fibroblasts, direct or indirect participation of a specific mechanism or cell type-specific factors are required for an efficient polyadenylation at the first 3′-terminal exon.

Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The 3′-end processing occurs by cleavage of the precursor RNA, generating the upstream cleavage product that is elongated by a poly(A) tail (for review, see Refs. 2Colgan D.F. Manley J.L.

The core elements of a polyadenylation signal correspond to a highly conserved hexanucleotide AAUAAA found 10–30 nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site and a less highly conserved GU-rich element located downstream of the cleavage site. Cleavage/polyadenylation is an intricate process requiring multiple cellular factors. At the first step of the polyadenylation reaction, the GU-rich sequence is recognized by one component of the cleavage stimulating factor (CstF),1 the protein CstF-64, which stabilizes the binding of the cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) to the AAUAAA hexamer (2Colgan D.F. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Other factors that are required are the cleavage factors (CFIm, CFIIm) (4Wahle E. Keller W. Trends Biochem.

Finally, the Poly(A) binding protein II (PABII) specifies the correct length of the poly(A) tail and increases the efficiency of polyadenylation (6Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E.

In contrast to U-rich sequences, the nature of downstream sequence elements (DSEs) is poorly defined and more complex. For example, it has been shown that a G-rich sequence downstream of the SV40 late poly(A) signal (21Chen F. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2614-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Hans H. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell.

For both USEs and DSEs, in vitro studies have indicated that they act as recognition sites for factors that stabilize the cleavage/polyadenylation complex (11Phillips C. Kyriakopoulou C.B. Virtanen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Schek N. Cooke C. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell.

The presence of negative regulatory elements has also been described. In certain contexts, inhibition of polyadenylation was found to be associated with the presence of a splice donor site located either upstream or downstream of the poly(A) site (11Phillips C. Kyriakopoulou C.B. Virtanen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Brackenridge S. Ashe H.L. Giacca M. Proudfoot N.J.

Cell. 1994; 76: 531-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For example, insertion of a bona fide 5′-splice site between the 3′-splice site and the poly(A) site was shown to abolish the coupling of the two reactions both in vivo and in vitro (27Niwa M. MacDonald C.C. Berget S.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the case of the promoter-proximal human immunodeficiency virus-1 poly(A) site, it has been demonstrated that its usage is repressed by interaction of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein with a splice donor site almost 200 nucleotides downstream (28Ashe M.P. Pearson L.H. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5752-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of mRNA 3′-end formation may reflect the modulation of activities elicited by different regulatory sequences depending on growth condition of the cell, its response to specific stimuli, or its differentiated state. Ultimately, the net effect of these modulations will either mask or enhance suboptimal poly(A) sites leading to alternative polyadenylation (reviewed in Ref. 29Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In addition, the efficiency at which the processing complex forms may also be influenced by the level of polyadenylation factors in the cell. Indeed, quantitative changes in CstF-64, possibly associated with the activities of not yet identified gene-specific regulators, have been reported to enhance recognition of an internal weak poly(A) site (30Cushley W. Coupar B.E. Mickelson C.A. Williamson A.R. Nature. 1982; 298: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Guise J.W. Lim P.L. Yuan D. Tucker P.W. J.

To gain more insights into the mechanisms leading to the cell type-specific selection of alternative poly(A) sites, we have investigated the processing of the pre-mRNA encoding the 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase enzyme (OASE) (33Benech P. Mory Y. Revel M. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In fibroblast cell lines, the OASE gene expresses 1.6- and 1.8-kb mRNAs (34Benech P. Merlin G. Revel M. Chebath J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Chebath J. Benech P. Hovanessian A. Galabru J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that differ by distinct 3′-ends, termed pA1.6 and pA1.8, and the presence of a composite exon (Fig. 1 A). However, in the B lymphoblastoid Daudi cells, only the 1.8-kb mRNA is detected. Based on transfection experiments using minigene constructs, we have compared the respective usage of the two poly(A) sites in different sequence contexts. We show that polyadenylation efficiency at the last 3′-terminal exon is independent of the poly(A) site sequence as well as of the surrounding regions. In contrast, although pA1.6 and pA1.8 carry a similar consensus core polyadenylation signal, substitution of one for the other at the first 3′-terminal exon showed functional differences in Daudi cells. Further experiments led to the identification within pA1.8 of a 25-nt long U-rich motif located immediately upstream of the AAUAAA signal that enhances cleavage/polyadenylation. Interestingly, insertion of this U-rich motif upstream of the pA1.6 poly(A) site is sufficient to induce an efficient cleavage/polyadenylation. These data add another example to the few mammalian poly(A) sites known to be regulated by such USE. However, in Daudi cells USE activity is not required to the same extent at the first and last 3′-terminal exons. Because the 1.6-kb mRNA is efficiently expressed in fibroblast cells, these cells may contain some specific factors that allow 3′-end processing of pA1.6 in the absence of USE. The primary Vwt plasmid was constructed by cloning the 4.4-kb SacI-HindIII genomic DNA fragment of the 2′-5′-OASE gene spanning from exon 4 to 1.1-kb sequence downstream of the terminal exon 6 (33Benech P. Mory Y. Revel M. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) into the pGEM1 vector. The minigene was placed under transcriptional control of the SV40 promoter obtained as a PvuII-EcoRI fragment from pSVK3 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). All other constructs used in this study were derived from the Vwt vector. In the Vd1.6, Vd1.8, and VppA plasmids, the pA1.6 and/or pA1.8 sequences (Fig.2 A) were duplicated or substituted for one another. Plasmids carrying the hybrid poly(A) sites at the first 3′-terminal exon (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) were derived from Vd1.8 and Vwt and used as templates to generate oligo-mediated site-specific mutations with Thermo Pol Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). The primer sequences and detailed procedures used for the design of the different constructs are available upon request. All the minigenes were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer.Figure 5pA1.8 USE sequence enables pA1.6 to be processed at the first 3′-terminal exon.

The cells were maintained at 5 × 105 cells/ml at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell transfection was carried out by electroporation of 2 × 107 cells in 0.3 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 μg of plasmid, using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Following the electroporation at 250 V, 960 μF, cells were resuspended in 20 ml of fresh complete medium and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown to 60% confluency in 14-cm dishes and transfected with 5 μg of DNA using the FuGENE 6TM transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was replaced after 16 h of incubation, and the cells were further incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfected cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested at 1500 rpm at 4 °C. Subsequently, the pelleted cells were used for poly(A+)RNA isolation by using the QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Purified poly(A+)RNAs were further subjected to DNase I treatment, and phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol-precipitated. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 50 to 500 ng of purified mRNA primed with oligo(dT)12–18, using SuperScript II RNaseH-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The OASE chimeric cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the following specific sets of primers: Fsv, (5′-GAGGCTTTTTTGGAGG-3′); R1.6, (5′-CACAATCGAGGGTTTCG-3′); and R1.8, (5′-GTGCACCTGATGGGAGGG-3′). The Fsv primer hybridizes immediately downstream of the last transcription start of the SV40 promoter. The R1.6 and R1.8 primers hybridize 45 and 25 nt upstream of the first AATAAA poly(A) signal of pA1.6 and pA1.8, respectively. Fex6, (5′-GTGCGAGGTCCGTCGTAGGTG-3′), and RG1.8, (5′-TGAAGTTGTTAATAAACAC-3′), were used to detect cDNAs corresponding to unprocessed chimeric RNAs. Fex6 and RG1.8 hybridize within exon 6 and downstream of the ACCA cleavage site, respectively. PCR reactions were carried out as follows. The primers were annealed at 60 °C for 30 s, and the extension was performed at 72 °C for 45 s. The thermal cycling was achieved as indicated in the figure legends. PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized on a transilluminator after ethidium bromide staining. Previous studies (33Benech P. Mory Y. Revel M. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Benech P. Merlin G. Revel M. Chebath J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that maturation of the OASE RNA precursor involves alternative 3′-end processing that is regulated in a cell type-specific manner (Fig.1 A). To understand the mechanism underlying specific poly(A) site usage, we first set up anin vivo approach based on transient transfection of an OASE-shortened gene. We designed a construct, Vwt, in which the OASE genomic region spanning from exon 4 to 1.1 kb downstream of exon 6 was placed under transcriptional control of the SV40 promoter (Fig.1 B, see “Material and Methods”). Poly(A+)RNAs purified from different Vwt-transfected cell lines were reverse transcribed, and specific sets of primers were used in PCR reactions to amplify cDNAs corresponding to chimeric mRNAs (Fig.1 B). A plasmid expressing chloramphenicol acetyl transferase was used as transfection efficiency control (data not shown). As expected, monkey COS-7- and human FS11-transfected cell lines express chimeric RNAs polyadenylated at both 3′-terminal exons (pA1.6 and pA1.8 RNAs, respectively), whereas Daudi-transfected cells produce only the RNA processed at the last 3′-terminal exon (pA1.8, Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrate that the chimeric pre-mRNA encoded by the Vwt minigene is submitted to the same cell type-specific maturation as the endogenous OASE precursor. The 3′-ends of the pA1.6 and pA1.8 transcripts (Fig.2 A) share a ACCAUUUAUUG sequence that contains the CA cleavage site (33Benech P. Mory Y. Revel M. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Benech P. Merlin G. Revel M. Chebath J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, part of this motif is complementary to the consensus AAUAAA signal that is present in both 3′-regions. Despite the similarities of their core sequences, it was possible that the polyadenylation efficiencies of the two poly(A) sites depend on RNA cis-acting elements present in the surrounding regions. To investigate such a possibility, we first replaced the poly(A) site of pA1.8 with the corresponding region of pA1.6 (Fig. 2 B,Vd1.6) to assess the ability of the pA1.6 site to be used when present in the last 3′-terminal exon. Simultaneous RT-PCR amplification of the pA1.6 and pA1.8 RNAs was performed with the 3′ primers, R1.6 and R1.8, together with the common 5′ primer, Fsv. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Vd1.6-transfected Daudi cells produce accurately spliced RNAs ending at exon 6 as efficiently as pA1.8 RNAs in Vwt-transfected cells. As expected, in Vd1.6-transfected COS-7 cells, transcripts polyadenylated at either first or last 3′-terminal exons are co-amplified (Fig. 2 B). To ensure that products detected in Vd1.6-transfected Daudi cells were amplified from transcripts 3′-end processed at the last 3′-terminal exon, RT-PCR was performed with 5′ primer specific to exon 6 and 3′ primer (RG1.8) hybridizing downstream of the cleavage site (Fig. 2 B). The barely detectable products amplified with this set of primers clearly demonstrate that pA1.6 is efficiently cleaved and polyadenylated at the last 3′-terminal exon. These results suggest that poor usage of pA1.6 in Daudi cells is related to its location within the OASE gene. We then assessed the processing of pA1.8 when located at the first 3′-terminal exon. To this end, we constructed two additional vectors (Vd1.8 and VppA) that were used in transient transfection assays. The former carries a duplication of the poly(A) site of pA1.8 that was cloned in place of the corresponding region of pA1.6. In the second construction, the two sites were swapped with the pA1.8 site located upstream of the pA1.6 site. Because in Vd1.8 the sequence corresponding to the 3′ primer (R1.8) was now located at both 3′-terminal exons, amplification of both chimeric transcripts was performed with the same set of primers in a single PCR reaction. As shown in Fig.2 C, RT-PCR analysis of RNA expressed in Vd1.8- and VppA-transfected Daudi cells demonstrates efficient usage of the pA1.8 site when the latter is located at the first 3′-terminal exon. Moreover, permutation of the poly(A) sites (VppA) in transfected COS-7 cells leads to a switch in the ratio of the two transcripts when compared with Vwt, suggesting that pA1.8 is processed more efficiently than pA1.6. Altogether, these results highlight the different cleaving and polyadenylation properties of pA1.6 and pA1.8 as well as the existence of a position effect in the recognition of these two sites. In a first attempt to determine the sequences responsible for the different polyadenylation efficiency of pA1.6 and pA1.8, we assessed the ability of chimeric polyadenylation regions to be recognized when located at the first 3′-terminal exon in Daudi cells. These chimeric regions were generated by sequential replacements of the arbitrarily defined segments a1.8, b1.8, and c1.8 (derived from pA1.8) with the corresponding regions from pA1.6 (Fig.3 A). The b-region contains the core poly(A) site sequence as well as the undecanucleotide motif common to pA1.6 and pA1.8, whereas the a- and c-regions correspond respectively to the upstream and downstream segments (Fig.2 A). PCR was performed on reverse-transcribed poly(A+)RNAs purified from transfected Daudi cells with either Fsv/R1.6 (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and11) or Fsv/R1.8 primers (lanes 2, 4,6, 8, and 12) that amplify, respectively, transcripts ending at exons 5 or 6. As shown in Fig.3 B, replacing the c1.8 and b1.8 segments with the pA1.6 counterparts does not affect 3′-end processing of pA1.8 at the first 3′-terminal position (lanes 5–8). In contrast, substitution of the upstream a1.8 segment with a1.6 abrogates the production of mRNAs ending at this location (Fig. 3 B, lane 9). The same effect was observed when the a1.8 region was replaced by an irrelevant sequence (Fig. 3 B, lane 11). These results imply that the 42-nt long sequence (a1.8) located immediately upstream of the AAUAAA signal activates pA1.8 processing when located at the first 3′-terminal exon in Daudi cells. To further delineate the minimal sequence responsible for this activation, the a1.8 sequence was shortened by deleting the first 17 nucleotides (Fig. 4 A). This deletion did not affect processing at the 3′-end of exon 5 (Fig.4 B, lane 3). However, no transcript was detectable when the remaining region was replaced by an irrelevant sequence of the same length (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). Therefore, we conclude that the last 25 nt of a1.8 contain a sequence that promotes efficient usage of the pA1.8 poly(A) site when located at the first 3′-terminal exon. Because this element contains a high proportion of U residues (42%), we investigated the impact of their replacement by G residues (Fig. 4 C). The mutation was performed in the context of the natural pA1.8 sequence, which allowed the use of the R1.8 primer. In cells transfected with the resulting VU/G vector, transcripts processed at the first 3′-terminal position could not be amplified (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3 and4), which highlights the crucial role of the U residues in a1.8 for efficient poly(A) site usage. The position of the 25-nt long motif, immediately upstream of the AAUAAA signal, as well as its U-richness fulfills the criteria defining USE, found in poly(A) signals of viruses and in a limited number of cellular genes (13Gilmartin G.M.

We further checked whether the USE of pA1.8 could trigger usage of pA1.6 at the first 3′-terminal exon in Daudi cells. Therefore, the a1.8 sequence, containing this element as well as the sequence of the R1.8 primer, was used to replace the corresponding region of pA1.6, a1.6 (Fig.5 A). Consistent with the effect observed in the context of pA1.8, the USE strongly promoted usage of the pA1.6 chimeric site (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4), whereas insertion of an irrelevant sequence had no effect (Fig. 5 B, lane 5). Moreover, replacement of the core poly(A) site sequence, b1.6, or the downstream region, c1.6, with b1.8 and c1.8, respectively, did not generate transcripts processed at the first 3′-terminal exon (Fig.5 B, lanes 7 and 9) from the respective minigenes. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that the absence of the 1.6-kb mRNA in Daudi cells is because of the location of its last exon and the intrinsic weakness of its 3′-processing region. The unfavorable sequence context may require a strong stabilization of the cleavage/polyadenylation factors that can be promoted by the USE. Moreover, these experiments indicate that the USE functions independent of a particular core poly(A) site or specific downstream elements. In this study we have investigated the sequence requirements underlying the use of two alternative poly(A) site sequences in the 2′-5′-oligo(A) synthetase gene. We have shown that the 3′-region of the first 3′-terminal exon (pA1.6), which is not recognized in the Daudi cell line, can be efficiently processed when inserted in place of the corresponding region (pA1.8) of the last terminal exon (Fig.2 B). This result demonstrates that the absence of the 1.6-kb mRNA in these cells does not result from intrinsic properties of its core polydenylation site. The efficient cleavage/polyadenylation of pA1.6 at the 3′-end of exon 6 likely is not because of the presence of positive elements in the surrounding sequences. The downstream region of this exon does not contain GU-rich motifs that are targets for CstF-64 or other accessory elements known to enhance cleavage/polydenylation (reviewed in Refs. 1Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Colgan D.F. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Moreover, replacement of the complete sequence of exon 6 with an unrelated sequence, as well as deletions in the region downstream of the cleavage site, did not affect 3′-end processing of pA1.8 (results not shown). The finding (36Dye M.J. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 371-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Yonaha M. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 593-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) directly influences polyadenylation may provide an explanation for the preferential use of the distal poly(A) site independent of its sequence. Accordingly, in vitro studies have pointed out the role of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II as a factor that activates polyadenylation (38Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 39Ryan K. Murthy K.G. Kaneko S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1684-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the last 3′-terminal poly(A) site is more favorably exposed than the internal site to the Pol II CTD-associated cleavage/polyadenylation factors. Conversely, processing at an internal poly(A) site may require an active mechanism allowing recognition of the region as an exon. Indeed, the usage of an internal poly(A) site is, in contrast to distal poly(A) sites, very often submitted to regulatory mechanisms (29Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In particular, some of the genes known to be subjected to such a regulation contain, like the OASE gene, a composite exon, the 3′-end of which is composed of either a 5′-splice site or a poly(A) site (29Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). It has been reported (25Furth P.A. Choe W.T. Rex J.H. Byrne J.C. Baker C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5278-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Vagner S. Ruegsegger U. Gunderson S.I. Keller W. Mattaj I.W. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that the presence of a 5′-splice site between a 3′-splice site and a poly(A) site can inhibit polyadenylation. For example, although recognition of a poly(A) site is inhibited by its insertion into an intron, mutation of the splicing signals restores its usage, suggesting that assembly of splicing complexes across the intron excludes the polyadenylation machinery (41Adami G. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,42Levitt N. Briggs D. Gil A. Proudfoot N.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Inhibition of polyadenylation may also result from the respective ability of the internal 5′-splice site and pA1.6 to compete for the recognition of the upstream 3′-splice site. As part of the mechanism called exon definition (43Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 44Niwa M. Berget S.M.

Biol. 1990; 10: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), implying an interaction between 3′- and 5′-splicing factors across the exon, an interaction of splicing and polyadenylation factors may similarly bridge between sequences to define a terminal exon. However, expressing a minigene in which the internal 5′-splice site and pA1.6 are located on distinct exons fails to generate mRNA polyadenylated at exon 5 in Daudi cells or an increase of this transcript in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Although the mechanism leading to the differential 3′-end processing at the first and last 3′-terminal exons has to be elucidated, our results highlight the different requirements for a 3′-end processing enhancer element at these locations. The identification of such an element (Fig.3 B) was based on the finding that pA1.8 can be cleaved and polyadenylated when placed at the 3′-end of exon 5 (Fig.2 C). It corresponds to a 25-nt long U-rich sequence located immediately upstream of the polyadenylation signal of pA1.8 (Fig.4). Insertion of this element in front of the of pA1.6 poly(A) site promoted efficient polyadenylation at the 3′-end of exon 5 in Daudi cells (Fig. 5 B). Similar elements, USEs, were found to modulate poly(A) site usage of several viral genes in a positive or negative manner (15Lutz C.S. Alwine J.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 16Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. Graveley B.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To date, USEs have been identified in a limited number of cellular genes, such as those encoding human C2 complement and Lamin B2 (17Moreira A. Takagaki Y. Brackenridge S. Wollerton M. Manley J.L. Proudfoot N.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2522-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Brackenridge S. Ashe H.L. Giacca M. Proudfoot N.J.

As for most of the USEs identified to date, the pA1.8 USE is 40% U-rich (Fig. 4 C). However, it contains a high proportion of adenine residues, a characteristic shared with the upstream sequence characterized in the murine IgM secretory poly(A) site (20Phillips C. Virtanen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2344-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although we did not investigate the effect of mutating A residues, we found that the U to G transition abrogates its function (Fig. 4 C), which confirms that U residues are crucial for USE activity (17Moreira A. Takagaki Y. Brackenridge S. Wollerton M. Manley J.L. Proudfoot N.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2522-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Brackenridge S. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2660-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that USE may modulate polyadenylation through direct or indirect interactions with factors of the basal cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. For example, it has been shown that CPSF can bind to adjacent auxiliary elements such as AU-rich sequences (20Phillips C. Virtanen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2344-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarly, the USE of the C2 complement gene (C2 USE) (17Moreira A. Takagaki Y. Brackenridge S. Wollerton M. Manley J.L. Proudfoot N.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2522-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 47Moreira A. Wollerton M. Monks J. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3809-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was shown to increase the affinity of CPSF-dependent binding of cleavage stimulating factor-64 to the C2 poly(A) site, leading to an efficient poly(A) synthesis. Moreover, C2 USE is also required for cleavage activity through its interaction with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) (48Gil A. Sharp P.A. Jamison S.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1224-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 49Patton J.G. Mayer S.A. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it can be postulated that in Daudi cells interaction of the cleavage/polyadenylation complex with the internal poly(A) site requires the presence of a cis-acting sequence element such as USE to stabilize this interaction. Therefore, in cells expressing 1.6-kb mRNA, such as fibroblast cells, 3′-end processing at the pA1.6 site must depend on a specific mechanism, possibly involving quantitative or qualitative cell type-specific differences in trans-acting factors. Supporting this hypothesis, our preliminary data have identified a 20-nt long sequence containing the internal 5′-splice site whose deletion strongly decreases pA1.6 usage without affecting cleavage/polyadenylation at the pA1.8 site when the latter is located at the internal position. 2P. D. Benech, Y. Aissouni, C. Perez, and B. Calmels, unpublished results. Interestingly, this element and the pA1.6 region share specific binding activities that are differently distributed in cell lines expressing distinct ratios of OASE mRNAs. Therefore, it is possible that expression of the 1.6-kb mRNA in fibroblast cells requires interactions of specific splicing factors. Indeed, a 5′-splicing factor such as U1A bound to the proximity of a poly(A) site (14Schek N. Cooke C. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5386-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was found to stabilize the interaction of the CPSF 160-kDa subunit with its AAUAAA-containing RNA substrate (50Lutz C.S. Murthy K.G. Schek N. O'Connor J.P. Manley J.L. Alwine J.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The observation (51Khanna K.K., An, S.J., Wu, J.M. Landolfo S. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5852-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that in interferon-induced fibroblast cells derived from Alzheimer's patients the processing of the 1.6 kb OASE mRNA is impaired confers to our model some interesting prospects. The characterization of the specific factors as well as the precise RNA targets involved in the 3′-end processing may help not only to gain more insights into post-transcriptional controls but also to reveal unexpected links with pathologies.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which UTP and CTP support G<sub>s</sub> activation. As models, we used S49 wild-type lymphoma cells, representing a physiologically relevant system in which the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) couples to G<sub>s</sub>, and Sf9 insect cell membranes expressing β<sub>2</sub>AR-Gα<sub>s</sub> fusion proteins. Fusion proteins provide a higher sensitivity for the analysis of β<sub>2</sub>AR-G<sub>s</sub> coupling than native systems. Nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (NTPs) supported agonist-stimulated AC activity in the two systems and basal AC activity in membranes from cholera toxin-treated S49 cells in the order of efficacy GTP ≥ UTP > CTP > ATP (ineffective). NTPs disrupted high affinity agonist binding in β<sub>2</sub>AR-Gα<sub>s</sub> in the order of efficacy GTP > UTP > CTP > ATP (ineffective). In contrast, the order of efficacy of NTPs as substrates for nucleoside diphosphokinase, catalyzing the formation of GTP from GDP and NTP was ATP ≥ UTP ≥ CTP ≥ GTP. NTPs inhibited β<sub>2</sub>AR-Gα<sub>s</sub>-catalyzed [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP hydrolysis in the order of potency GTP > UTP > CTP. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that UTP is accommodated more easily within the binding pocket of Gα<sub>s</sub>than CTP. Collectively, our data indicate that GTP, UTP, and CTP interact differentially with G<sub>s</sub> proteins and that transphosphorylation of GDP to GTP is not involved in this G protein activation. In certain cell systems, intracellular UTP and CTP concentrations reach ∼10 nmol/mg of protein and are higher than intracellular GTP concentrations, indicating that G protein activation by UTP and CTP can occur physiologically. G protein activation by UTP and CTP could be of particular importance in pathological conditions such as cholera and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome."
