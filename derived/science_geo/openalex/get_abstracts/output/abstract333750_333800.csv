https://openalex.org/W2012187514,"In order to build autonomous robots that can carry out useful work in unstructured environments new approaches have been developed to building intelligent systems. The relationship to traditional academic robotics and traditional artificial intelligence is examined. In the new approaches a tight coupling of sensing to action produces architectures for intelligence that are networks of simple computational elements which are quite broad, but not very deep. Recent work within this approach has demonstrated the use of representations, expectations, plans, goals, and learning, but without resorting to the traditional uses of central, abstractly manipulable or symbolic representations. Perception within these systems is often an active process, and the dynamics of the interactions with the world are extremely important. The question of how to evaluate and compare the new to traditional work still provokes vigorous discussion."

Light forces have been achieved which strongly affect the dynamics of individual small particles. It is now possible to optically accelerate, slow, stably trap, and manipulate micrometer-sized dielectric particles and atoms. This leads to a diversity of new scientific and practical applications in fields where small particles play a role, such as light scattering, cloud physics, aerosol science, atomic physics, quantum optics, and high-resolution spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2001638798,"Leaves of many desert and agricultural species have the ability to move diurnally, orienting perpendicular or parallel to the sun's direct rays. This phenomenon is widespread in many plant families and occurs in both C(3) and C(4) photosynthetic pathway plants. In the annual flora of desert communities, solar tracking becomes more frequent as the length of the growing season decreases. Leaves that are perpendicular to the sun's direct rays for tracking appear to have high photosynthetic rates throughout the day, whereas leaves parallel to the sun's rays have reduced leaf temperatures and transpirational water losses."

Chemicals alone at low concentrations, not particles, trigger feeding. Krill form dense schools that move rapidly and migrate primarily horizontally. Abrupt disruption of a school can trigger mass molting, and molts may act as decoys."
https://openalex.org/W2054570699,"A climatically sensitive huon pine tree-ring chronology from western Tasmania allows inferences about Austral summer temperature change since A.D. 900. Since 1965, huon pine growth has been unusually rapid for trees that are in many cases over 700 years old. This growth increase correlates well with recent anomalous warming in Tasmania on the basis of instrumental records and supports claims that a climatic change, perhaps influenced by greenhouse gases, is in progress. Although this temperature increase exceeds any that are inferred to have occurred during the past 1089 years at this location, it has not yet clearly emerged from the natural background variability of climate in this part of the Southern Hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2010165857,"Atomically resolved images of pressed powder samples have been obtained with the atomic force microscope (AFM). The technique was successful in resolving the particle, domain, and atomic structure of pismo clam (Tivela stultorum) and sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) shells and of commercially available calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and strontium carbonate (SrCO3) powders. Grinding and subsequent pressing of the shells did not destroy the microstructure of these materials. The atomic-resolution imaging capabilities of AFM can be applied to polycrystalline samples by means of pressing powders with a grain size as small as 50 micrometers. These results illustrate that the AFM is a promising tool for material science and the study of biomineralization."
https://openalex.org/W2015198362,"Natural language processing (NLP) is the study of mathematical and computational modeling of various aspects of language and the development of a wide range of systems. These include spoken language systems that integrate speech and natural language; cooperative interfaces to databases and knowledge bases that model aspects of human-human interaction; multilingual interfaces; machine translation; and message-understanding systems, among others. Research in NLP is highly interdisciplinary, involving concepts in computer science, linguistics, logic, and psychology. NLP has a special role in computer science because many aspects of the field deal with linguistic features of computation and NLP seeks to model language computationally."
https://openalex.org/W2085980798,"The performance of microprocessors has increased steadily over the past 20 years at a rate of about 50% per year. This is the cumulative result of architectural improvements as well as increases in circuit speed. Moreover, this improvement has been obtained in a transparent fashion, that is, without requiring programmers to rethink their algorithms and programs, thereby enabling the tremendous proliferation of computers that we see today. To continue this performance growth, microprocessor designers have incorporated instruction-level parallelism (ILP) into new designs. ILP utilizes the parallel execution ofthe lowest level computer operations-adds, multiplies, loads, and so on-to increase performance transparently. The use of ILP promises to make possible, within the next few years, microprocessors whose performance is many times that of a CRAY-IS. This article provides an overview of ILP, with an emphasis on ILP architectures-superscalar, VLIW, and dataflow processors-and the compiler techniques necessary to make ILP work well."
https://openalex.org/W2052685439,Seismic waves generated by earthquakes or explosions show a delay in travel times as they propagate across the Sierra Nevada from all directions except that of the Nevada test site. Early arriving waves from the test site can be explained if they emerge through a rock layer with high seismic velocity from the sharp eastern edge of the Sierran root. Such a layer could be formed by the subducted ophiolite slab that crops out in the western Sierra Nevada foothills. A synthesis of all seismic data indicates that the Sierran root projects downward into the mantle to a depth of about 55 kilometers beneath the high Sierra.
https://openalex.org/W2003965162,"In stark contrast to the popular vision, the impact of greenhouse warming in the US will be, by and large, mild and the nation should have little trouble adapting to the several-degree temperature rise predicted for the middle of the next century. That message comes not from the National Coal Association of Sciences in a new report released last week. In assessing the ultimate impact of climate change, the crux of the issue is both the rate of change and the speed with which society and nature can respond. Indeed, the report reads like a virtual paean to human adaptability, technological innovation, and the market. It describes the myriad innovations that have climate-proofed humans and their activities over the past century - such as refrigeration, air conditioning, windshield wipers, and irrigation - the sorts of technologies that will help society cope with greenhouse warming, the panel notes. It concludes that both the speed of innovation and the turnover rate of capital investments - the time it takes to replace equipment in industry or cultivars in agriculture - are faster than the projected rate of climate change. The bulk of the report is an analysis of how sensitive various activities ormore » ecosystems are to climate change, and how adaptable.« less"

https://openalex.org/W3206139458,"Like a species that has moved into open niches, evolved, and diversified, chemistry can no longer be seen as a discrete scientific field. Its methods, concepts, and practitioners are penetrating virtually every nook and cranny of science and technology. That message came through clearly 2 weeks ago in New York City at the Fourth Chemical Congress of North America-a week-long conference organized by the American Chemical Society, the Chemical Institute of Canada, and the Chemical Society of Mexico and attended by some 10,000 scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. In roughly 4200 papers, participants explored such topics as borrowing from nature to improve industrial processes and electronic devices, and controlling the molecular architecture of clays and polymers."

https://openalex.org/W2080374767,"In the summer of 1992, industry researchers hope to spill and set ablaze tens of thousands of gallons of crude oil in the ice-choked waters of the Beaufort Sea off Alaska's northern coast. The researchers want to determine how well federal or industrial emergency response teams can deal with a future accidental oil spill in Arctic waters and learn whether fire can serve as an effective cleanup tool. First, however, they must convince federal and state regulators to sanction the test, and that's proving difficult. One reason for concern is that the standard approach to oil cleanup may not work in this area. Special hazards - the rough weather that often batters the Beaufort Sea, the darkness that envelops the area during most of the winter, and the ice - make it virtually impossible to deploy booms and collectors of the kind used for spills in warmer waters. The planned spill in the Beaufort Sea is an attempt to test alternative cleanup technologies. It is being sponsored by Alaska Clean Seas (ACS), a nonprofit organization composed of the major oil and gas companies operating in Alaska."
