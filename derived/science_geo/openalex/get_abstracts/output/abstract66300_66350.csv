The evoked waves, which shOW considerable detail and consistency within and across subjects, may be clinically useful in evaluating subcortical function."

https://openalex.org/W1971319162,"Bone marrow and spleen cells react differently after treatment with cortisone acetate in vivo. Antibody-forming, hematopoietic, and proliferative responses of spleen cells are reduced, while bone marrow cell responses are not. The stimulation of spleen cells by phytohemagglutinin is abolished, but the response of marrow cells is enhanced. These reactions provide functional markers for the different cells involved in immunologic responses."

This finding suggests a relative instability of beta chain messenger RNA in beta thalassemia."
https://openalex.org/W1992583745,Fourier analysis of discharge patterns in response to sinusoidal acoustic stimulation provides a consistent and repeatable measure of response phase and amplitude. The variation of the fundamental and harmonic components of the patterns as stimulus parameters are changed is strikingly similar to that of cochlear microphonics. The results are significantly different for single fibers with different characteristic frequencies; the variations parallel those of microphonics recorded from different cochlear turns.
https://openalex.org/W2034260043,"Intercellular spaces of Periplaneta rectal pads are visible at a magnification of Ã— 100 and distend during fluid uptake. Samples (0.025 to 0.1 nanoliter) obtained by micropuncture from the spaces were consistently more concentrated than the fluid in the rectal lumen. This observation supports the hypothesis of ""local"" osmosis in epithelial fluid transport."

https://openalex.org/W1965405116,"When the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia californica is exposed to 5 percent carbon dioxide, certain neurons are depolarized, others hyperpolarized, and some are unaffected. The effect of increased carbon dioxide is due solely to the concomitant fall in extracellular pH, which causes an increase in membrane chloride conductance of responsive cells. The directional change of the membrane potential in different neurons is determined by the relative values of the chloride equilibrium and the resting potentials. The chloride equilibrium potentials are calculated after direct measurement of the intracellular chloride activity with a chloride microelectrode."

https://openalex.org/W2000205486,"Two additional urinary metabolites of the chemical oncogen 3-hydroxyxanthine are now identified as 8-chloroxanthine and 8-methylmercaptoxanthine. Such products are thought to be derived from a reactive intermediate which can be tentatively considered to be a proximate oncogen. Since each of these 8-substituted xanthines has also been obtained in vitro by reactions of 3-acetoxyxanthine with chloride ion or methionine, their production in vivo can be explained as resulting through the metabolic formation of an activated ester with a reactivity similar to that of the chemical model."
https://openalex.org/W1990239922,"The incubation of slices of cerebral cortex under hyperbaric oxygen pressures from 1 to 10 atmospheres in the presence of radioactive glucose, pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, L-glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid causes a marked diminution of tissue oxidative reactions. There is a simultaneous decrease in phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate, and a reduction of the apparent intracellular ionic gradients. The increase of lipid peroxides, measured directly, is attributed to the toxic effects of hyperbaric oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1984233357,"Combining the techniques of nuclear transplantation and cytoplasmic transfer, dissociated amoeba nuclei, cytoplasm, and membranes were reassembled to form viable amoebae. The techniques of cell reassembly appear to be sufficiently adequate so that any desired combination of cytoplasm, nucleus, and membrane can be assembled into living cells."

https://openalex.org/W2027751537,"Castration increased incorporation of tritiated thymidine into total DNA in the anterior pituitary gland. Furthermore, there was a threefold increase in the percentage of labeled basophils 1 month after castration. Exposure of rats to constant light or dark also changed DNA synthesis; these changes depended on age of the animal and on exposure length. The results reflect physiologically induced mitotic activity in specific classes of pituitary cells and further suggest that neuroendocrine mechanisms may be involved in control of cell turnover in the gland."

https://openalex.org/W1995118192,"Tubules on the surface of the renal cortex are intertwined with the capillaries. Micropuncture experiments on rats show that generally the flow of tubular fluid is against the flow of blood in the peritubular capillaries. A countercurrent flow system, therefore, exists not only in the renal papilla but also in the superficial cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1965733640,"IN considering the possibility of life on other planets, we are naturally prejudiced towards some variant of the terrestrial photosynthetic mechanism, for CO2 fixation. Such a prejudice is reasonable: photosynthesis is efficient and we know that it works. But there are reasons why such a cycle may not be likely on a planet such as Mars. The chemical machinery required for photosynthesis is exceedingly complex and is unlikely to be available to the most elementary organisms. Furthermore, on many planets, such as Mars, there is a considerable flux of high energy ultraviolet radiation which reaches the planetary surface1 and which will tend to rupture bonds in organic molecules. Because photosynthetic organisms must be exposed to light, it seems unlikely that they could survive for long in the face of this radiation. It is, of course, conceivable that an organism could develop protective or self-repairing capabilities, but this would be particularly difficult for primitive life: in these conditions, life would be easiest in the shade. This would disfavour, but not exclude, an energy cycle based on photosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2055803964,The distribution of enriched uranium on individual hydroxyapatite crystals after an exchange reaction has been investigated by means of thermal neutron irradiation followed by electron microscopic analysis of fission fragment tracks in plastic support films. One uranyl ion for every two to three surface calcium ions became associated with the mineral but in a nonuniform distribution that strongly favors crystal end regions.
