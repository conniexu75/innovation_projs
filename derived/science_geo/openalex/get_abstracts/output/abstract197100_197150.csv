In this laboratory, we have found that the Kabete ‘O’ strain of virulent rinderpest virus multiplies in mono-layers of bovine embryonic kidney cells and produces characteristic cytological changes. In addition, kidney-passaged virus destroys bovine fibroblasts grown from embryonic skin-muscle tissue and prepubertal testis."

A biopsy specimen of the vein was taken 48 hr. after production of the thrombosis, and on histological examination in every case the vein appeared normal. Extending these observations, we have found (unpublished) that the lysis was due to the production of fibrinolysin locally in the vein, and that it still occurred even when the thrombosed segment of vein was ligatured above and below the thrombus and all visible veins draining into it occluded by cautery. We have shown that the lysis of such clots can be prevented by the administration of corticotropin1."

Since then, similar exudate collected 30 min. after injury has been found to contain 1–3 µgm. 5-hydroxytryptamine/ml. One hour after injection this value has fallen to 0.2 µgm./ml. or less. 30-min. exudates contain less than 0.5 µgm. of histamine."

https://openalex.org/W2068923160,"THE reticulo-endothelial cells are known to form an important part of the defence mechanism of the body against infection. At the site of acute infections, neutrophil leucocytes attack the invading organisms while the reticulo-endothelial macrophages phagocytose the dead bacteria and dead tissue cells. In chronic infections such as tuberculosis, the phagocytic activity of the macrophages forms the main line of defence against the invading organisms. Further, there is much circumstantial evidence in both acute and chronic infections to show that the reticulo-endothelial cells raise the humoral resistance of the patient by the production of antibodies. It has already been demonstrated that the phagocytic activity of the reticulo-endothelial system is stimulated by œstrogens1; that cortisone2, testosterone, androstene-3β-17α-diol3 depress the phagocytic activity; and that deoxycorticosterone4 has no appreciable effect."
https://openalex.org/W1991662362,"As Frisch-Niggomeyer1 has pointed out, many viruses of plant and animal origin seem to contain the same quantity of ribonucleic acid, about 2 X 106 gm. per mole of virus. Recently, cytoplasmic nucleo-protein particles have been isolated from yeast2, pea root (Tsao, P., et al., personal communication) and rat liver3. From the particle weight and percentage of nucleic acid found for the particles from either yeast or pea root, a value of 1.7 × 106 gm. for the weight of ribonucleic acid existing in one mole of nucleoprotein may be calculated. A similar amount of ribonucleic acid seems to be contained also in the cytoplasmic particles from rat liver. Thus, in the normal cytoplasmic nucleoprotein particles of both plant and animal origin, the mass of ribonucleic acid appears to be the same and coincides with the amount found in many plant and animal viruses. In view of the diverse origin and very large variations in chemical and morphological complexity and in the absolute amounts of all other chemical constituents, the uniformity of nucleic acid content of these nucleo-proteins is felt to be remarkable."

https://openalex.org/W2075826195,"GLUTATHIONE was suspected to be involved in respiratory or redox processes even before its structure was known. Among the very extensive subsequent work1 there appears, however, to have been little attempt to appraise such a role in animals by direct determination of the levels of the oxidized and reduced forms of glutathione in arterial and venous blood, which is rich in glutathione."

The method used was the paper electrophoretic method described by Smith and Conley1 using veronal buffer pH 8.6 and ionic strength 0.05 or 0.06. Several types of pathological haemoglobins have been found; among others, haemoglobin E and haemoglobin S. This communication describes the discovery of the sickling gene which has hitherto not been found in Indonesia."

No published report has come to our knowledge of endrin resistance of the spiny boll worm. However, it has been claimed that the cotton boll weevil has developed resistance to this compound1."
