https://openalex.org/W2053281725,"Acid rain is widely believed to be responsible for acidifying soil and water in areas of North America and northern Europe. However, factors commonly considered to make landscapes susceptible to acidification by acid rain are the same factors long known to strongly acidify soils through the natural processes of soil formation. Recovery from extreme and widespread careless land use has also occurred in regions undergoing acidification. There is evidence that acidification by acid rain is superimposed on long-term acidification induced by changes in land use and consequent vegetative succession. Thus, the interactions of acid rain, acid soil, and vegetation need to be carefully examined on a watershed basis in assessing benefits expected from proposed reductions in emissions of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2002794019,"An extensive array of measurements extending back to the mid-19th century was used to investigate large-scale changes in precipitation over Northern Hemisphere land areas. Significant increases in mid-latitude precipitation and concurrent decreases in low-latitude precipitation have occurred over the last 30 to 40 years. Although these large-scale trends are consistent with general circulation model projections of precipitation changes associated with doubled concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, they should be viewed as defining large-scale natural climatic variability. Additional work to refine regional variations and address potential network inhomogeneities is needed. This study attempts to show secular precipitation fluctuations over hemispheric- and continental-scale areas of the Northern Hemisphere."

These ligands have made possible the isolation, or direct observation, of large numbers of trigonal bipyramidal organo-nonmetallic species. Many of these species are analogs of transition states for nucleophilic displacement reactions and have been stabilized by the ligands to such a degree that they have become ground-state energy minima. Ideas derived from research on these species have been applied to carbon species to generate a molecule that is an analog of the transition state for the associative nucleophilic displacement reaction. The molecule is a pentavalent carbon species that has been observed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1965959209,"The removal of a single dominant individual has been shown to trigger a sex change in some coral-reef fish. In the saddleback Wrasse (Thalassoma duperrey), however, female-to-male sex change requires visual stimulation from smaller conspecifics. This change is not dependent on the sex or color of the stimulus fish and can be inhibited by larger conspecifics. On the reef, a female probably changes sex when the relative numbers of larger and smaller conspecifics change within her home range."
https://openalex.org/W1986197116,"After molting, stomatopods can be evicted easily from home cavities by conspecifics because these marine crustaceans lose temporarily their body armor and the use of their raptorial appendages. Some newly molted stomatopods defend their cavities with a meral spread display, a signal correlated with attack when used by animals between molts. The use of the meral spread display actually increases after molting. Since new molts cannot fight, their use of meral spread appears to be a bluff."
https://openalex.org/W2029163501,"The forest frog Eleutherodactylus coqui defends specific sites for retreats and nests in the Luquillo Forest, Puerto Rico. The hypothesis that shortages of nest and retreat sites limit population size was tested by placing 100 bamboo frog houses in plots measuring 100 square meters in areas of high frog density. These new sites were readily adopted by adult frogs. After one year, experimental plots had significantly more nests and frogs of all sizes than did control plots."
https://openalex.org/W2078895566,"A network of second-generation low-temperature gravitational radiation detectors is nearing completion. These detectors, sensitive to mechanical strains of order 10-18, are possible because of a variety of technical innovations that have been made in cryogenics, low-noise superconducting instrumentation, and vibration isolation techniques. Another five orders of magnitude improvement in energy sensitivity of resonant-mass detectors is possible before the linear amplifier quantum limit is encountered."
https://openalex.org/W1971363425,"Whereas dissimilatory sulfate reduction in marine environments has been postulated on the basis of sulfur isotope abundances as commencing before about 2.8 x 10(9) years ago, data from the Huronian Supergroup, Canada, suggest that oxidative-reductive reactions involving sulfur in continental environments were not significant before about 2.2 x 10(9) years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2083722924,"The fossil evidence for the early evolution of vertebrates consists of the remains of agnathans, jawless vertebrates, from the Ordovician of Australia, North America, and Bolivia. Because of the fragmentary nature of the material, it has not been possible to reconstruct these animals sufficiently well to understand their relation to each other and to later vertebrates. Though two genera have been known from the Harding Sandstone of North America since 1892, there are still only three articulated specimens known, two of Astraspis desiderata and one of Eriptychius americanus. The most recently found specimen of Astraspis was reexamined and found to show the orbit, a series of eight branchial openings and a complete tail, structures hitherto undescribed in any Ordovician vertebrate. A reconstruction ofAstraspis shows, on the basis of the series of branchial openings, that it is a primitive craniate and not a heterostracan as previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2067651809,"Geological studies of Espa침ola (Hood) Island, Gal치pagos, Ecuador, indicate that the island had a subaerial rather than a submarine origin. Because the younger lava flows are dated at 3 million years, Espa침ola has apparently existed as an island for at least that long. Thus terrestrial life may have existed or arrived on the Gal치pagos Islands at least 3 million years ago, more than twice as long as had been assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2029036905,"Sillimanite in six granulite-facies, kornerupine-bearing rocks contains 0.035 to 0.43 percent B(2)O(3) and 0.02 to 0.23 percent MgO (by weight). Substitution of boron for silicon and magnesium for aluminum is coupled such that the ratio of magnesium to boron is about 0.5. Sillimanite incorporates more than 0.1 percent B(2)O(3) only at high temperatures in a boron-rich environment at very low partial pressures of water. In the amphibolite facies, the sillimanite boron contents are too low to appreciably affect the stability relations of sillimanite with kyanite and andalusite."

https://openalex.org/W2067129850,"Two major discoveries, the scanning tunneling microscope and superconducting ceramics, highlight IBM Zurich lab's success in tapping Europe's scientific talent. The Zurich research laboratory was set up in 1956 as the European arm of the IBM's research division. Zurich was chosen for two main reasons: its geographical centrality and its political neutrality. Two factors for the lab's recent successes are: (1) that key decisions about which research proposals to support are made by managers who have themselves been selected for their scientific competence and (2) a willingness to take scientific risks."
