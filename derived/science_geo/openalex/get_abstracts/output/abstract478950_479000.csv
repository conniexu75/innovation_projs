https://openalex.org/W1973260880,"Improving Whole-Genome Screens Improved methods are needed for the knockout of individual genes in genome-scale functional screens. Wang et al. (p. 80 , published online 12 December) and Shalem et al. (p. 84 , published online 12 December) used the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system to power-screen protocols that avoid several of the pitfalls associated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens. Genome editing by these methods completely disrupts target genes, thus avoiding weak signals that can occur when transcript abundance is partially decreased by siRNA. Furthermore, gene targeting by the CRISPR system is more precise and appears to produce substantially fewer off-target effects than existing methods."
https://openalex.org/W2115276344,"Back with a Vengeance After surgery, gliomas (a type of brain tumor) recur in nearly all patients and often in a more aggressive form. Johnson et al. (p. 189 , published online 12 December 2013) used exome sequencing to explore whether recurrent tumors harbor different mutations than the primary tumors and whether the mutational profile in the recurrences is influenced by postsurgical treatment of patients with temozolomide (TMZ), a chemotherapeutic drug known to damage DNA. In more than 40% of cases, at least half of the mutations in the initial glioma were undetected at recurrence. The recurrent tumors in many of the TMZ-treated patients bore the signature of TMZ-induced mutagenesis and appeared to follow an evolutionary path to high-grade glioma distinct from that in untreated patients."
https://openalex.org/W1991288592,"The global spread of epidemics, rumors, opinions, and innovations are complex, network-driven dynamic processes. The combined multiscale nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the underlying networks make it difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of these processes, to distinguish relevant from peripheral factors, to predict their time course, and to locate their origin. However, we show that complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple, homogeneous wave propagation patterns, if conventional geographic distance is replaced by a probabilistically motivated effective distance. In the context of global, air-traffic-mediated epidemics, we show that effective distance reliably predicts disease arrival times. Even if epidemiological parameters are unknown, the method can still deliver relative arrival times. The approach can also identify the spatial origin of spreading processes and successfully be applied to data of the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2003 SARS epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2016564617,"Early Separation In photovoltaic devices, electrons excited by the absorption of light must travel across a junction, while the positively charged “holes” they leave behind effectively migrate in the opposite direction. If the electrons and holes do not separate efficiently, they can recombine and fail to produce any appreciable current. Gélinas et al. (p. 512 , published online 12 December; see the Perspective by Bredas ) studied this separation process by ultrafast optical absorption spectroscopy in thiophene-derived donor-fullerene acceptor systems common in organic photovoltaics and report a rate significantly faster than simple charge diffusion would suggest. The results implicate a coherent charge delocalization process, likely to involve fullerene π-electron states."
https://openalex.org/W2164026798,"An understanding of ctenophore biology is critical for reconstructing events that occurred early in animal evolution. Toward this goal, we have sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genome of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. Our phylogenomic analyses of both amino acid positions and gene content suggest that ctenophores rather than sponges are the sister lineage to all other animals. Mnemiopsis lacks many of the genes found in bilaterian mesodermal cell types, suggesting that these cell types evolved independently. The set of neural genes in Mnemiopsis is similar to that of sponges, indicating that sponges may have lost a nervous system. These results present a newly supported view of early animal evolution that accounts for major losses and/or gains of sophisticated cell types, including nerve and muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010052854,"Soft, Selective CO Sorption Many industrial processes produce CO, which could be used as a chemical feedstock, but separation of CO from other gases, especially N 2 , is too difficult to be economically viable. Sato et al. (p. 167 , published online 12 December 2013) now report that a porous coordination polymer containing Cu 2+ ions can selectivity bind CO through serial structural changes reminiscent of allosteric effects in proteins. The separation of CO-N 2 mixtures can be achieved with a low input energy for CO desorption."

(p. 171 , published online 12 December 2013; see the Perspective by Spencer ) analyzed spectral images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope that show ultraviolet emissions from the moon's atmosphere, and report a statistically significant emission signal extending above the satellite's southern hemisphere. This emission is consistent with two 200-km-high plumes of water vapor. Tidal stresses likely play a role in opening and closing fractures at the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2087647114,"Storage and transportation of hydrogen is a major obstacle for its use as a fuel. An increasingly considered alternative for the direct handling of hydrogen is to use carbon dioxide (CO2) as an intermediate storage material. However, CO2 is thermodynamically stable, and developed chemical catalysts often require high temperatures, pressures, and/or additives for high catalytic rates. Here, we present the discovery of a bacterial hydrogen-dependent carbon dioxide reductase from Acetobacterium woodii directly catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2. We also demonstrate a whole-cell system able to produce formate as the sole end product from dihydrogen (H2) and CO2 as well as syngas. This discovery opens biotechnological alternatives for efficient CO2 hydrogenation either by using the isolated enzyme or by employing whole-cell catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2046919791,"In the process of morphological evolution, the extent to which cryptic, preexisting variation provides a substrate for natural selection has been controversial. We provide evidence that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) phenotypically masks standing eye-size variation in surface populations of the cavefish Astyanax mexicanus. This variation is exposed by HSP90 inhibition and can be selected for, ultimately yielding a reduced-eye phenotype even in the presence of full HSP90 activity. Raising surface fish under conditions found in caves taxes the HSP90 system, unmasking the same phenotypic variation as does direct inhibition of HSP90. These results suggest that cryptic variation played a role in the evolution of eye loss in cavefish and provide the first evidence for HSP90 as a capacitor for morphological evolution in a natural setting."
https://openalex.org/W1999143685,"Genomes contain both a genetic code specifying amino acids and a regulatory code specifying transcription factor (TF) recognition sequences. We used genomic deoxyribonuclease I footprinting to map nucleotide resolution TF occupancy across the human exome in 81 diverse cell types. We found that ~15% of human codons are dual-use codons (""duons"") that simultaneously specify both amino acids and TF recognition sites. Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias. Conversely, the regulatory code has been selectively depleted of TFs that recognize stop codons. More than 17% of single-nucleotide variants within duons directly alter TF binding. Pervasive dual encoding of amino acid and regulatory information appears to be a fundamental feature of genome evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2045301848,"Erythropoietin is a signaling glycoprotein that controls the fundamental process of erythropoiesis, orchestrating the production and maintenance of red blood cells. As administrated clinically, erythropoietin has a polypeptide backbone with complex dishomogeneity in its carbohydrate domains. Here we describe the total synthesis of homogeneous erythropoietin with consensus carbohydrate domains incorporated at all of the native glycosylation sites. The oligosaccharide sectors were built by total synthesis and attached stereospecifically to peptidyl fragments of the wild-type primary sequence, themselves obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. The glycopeptidyl constructs were joined by chemical ligation, followed by metal-free dethiylation, and subsequently folded. This homogeneous erythropoietin glycosylated at the three wild-type aspartates with N-linked high-mannose sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides and O-linked glycophorin exhibits Procrit-level in vivo activity in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1982096153,"Noble gas molecules have not hitherto been detected in space. From spectra obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory, we report the detection of emission in the 617.5 GHz and 1234.6 GHz J = 1-0 and 2-1 rotational lines of {36}ArH^+ at several positions in the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant known to contain both H2 molecules and regions of enhanced ionized argon emission. {36}Ar is believed to have originated from explosive nucleosynthesis in massive stars during core-collapse supernova events. Its detection in the Crab Nebula, the product of such a supernova event, confirms this expectation. The likely excitation mechanism for the observed {36}ArH^+ emission lines is electron collisions in partially ionized regions with electron densities of a few hundred per centimeter cubed."
https://openalex.org/W2038286309,"The Parkinson disease protein α-synuclein is N-terminally acetylated, but most in vitro studies have been performed using unacetylated α-synuclein. Binding to lipid membranes is considered key to the still poorly understood function of α-synuclein. We report the effects of N-terminal acetylation on α-synuclein binding to lipid vesicles of different composition and curvature and to micelles composed of the detergents β-octyl-glucoside (BOG) and SDS. In the presence of SDS, N-terminal acetylation results in a slightly increased helicity for the N-terminal ~10 residues of the protein, likely due to the stabilization of N-terminal fraying through the formation of a helix cap motif. In the presence of BOG, a detergent used in previous isolations of helical oligomeric forms of α-synuclein, the N-terminally acetylated protein adopts a novel conformation in which the N-terminal ~30 residues bind the detergent micelle in a partly helical conformation, whereas the remainder of the protein remains unbound and disordered. Binding of α-synuclein to lipid vesicles with high negative charge content is essentially unaffected by N-terminal acetylation irrespective of curvature, but binding to vesicles of lower negative charge content is increased, with stronger binding observed for vesicles with higher curvature. Thus, the naturally occurring N-terminally acetylated form of α-synuclein exhibits stabilized helicity at its N terminus and increased affinity for lipid vesicles similar to synaptic vesicles, a binding target of the protein in vivo. Furthermore, the novel BOG-bound state of N-terminally acetylated α-synuclein may serve as a model of partly helical membrane-bound intermediates with a role in α-synuclein function and dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2028863083,"The central nervous system rapidly learns that particular stimuli predict imminent danger. This learning is thought to involve associations between neutral and harmful stimuli in cortical and limbic brain regions, though associative neuroplasticity in sensory structures is increasingly appreciated. We observed the synaptic output of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in individual mice before and after they learned that a particular odor indicated an impending foot shock. OSNs are the first cells in the olfactory system, physically contacting the odor molecules in the nose and projecting their axons to the brain's olfactory bulb. OSN output evoked by the shock-predictive odor was selectively facilitated after fear conditioning. These results indicate that affective information about a stimulus can be encoded in its very earliest representation in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2046906144,"Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) include methane (CH4), black carbon (BC), tropospheric ozone, and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). They are important contributors to anthropogenic climate change, responsible for as much as one-third of the current total greenhouse forcing ( 1 ). An emerging strategy, which we refer to as hybrid climate mitigation (HCM), emphasizes reducing SLCPs in parallel with long-lived carbon dioxide (CO2) so as to achieve climate goals, as well as health and food security benefits, associated with some of the SLCPs. Proponents of HCM argue that we should focus substantial effort on reducing SLCPs now, as we wait for sufficient political will to reduce CO2 emissions ( 2 – 4 ). But others ( 5 ) worry that any strategy involving SLCPs risks delaying efforts to reduce CO2, the main greenhouse gas most important for long-term warming if emissions continue as projected."
https://openalex.org/W2046953990,"In the simplest realization of Brownian motion, a colloidal sphere moves randomly in an isotropic fluid; its mean squared displacement (MSD) grows linearly with time τ. Brownian motion in an orientationally ordered fluid—a nematic—is anisotropic, with the MSD being larger along the axis of molecular orientation, called the director. We found that at short time scales, the anisotropic diffusion in a nematic becomes anomalous, with the MSD growing slower or faster than τ; these states are respectively termed subdiffusion and superdiffusion. The anomalous diffusion occurs at time scales that correspond to the relaxation times of director deformations around the sphere. Once the nematic melts, the diffusion becomes normal and isotropic. Our experiment shows that the deformations and fluctuations of long-range orientational order profoundly influence diffusive regimes."

In a seeming paradox, these critical host defense cells often respond by increasing glucose catabolism while simultaneously storing fatty acids (FA) as triglycerides (TAG) in lipid droplets. We used a load-chase strategy to study the mechanisms that promote long term retention of TAG in murine and human macrophages. Toll-like receptor (TLR)1/2, TLR3, and TLR4 agonists all induced the cells to retain TAG for ≥3 days. Prolonged TAG retention was accompanied by the following: (a) enhanced FA uptake and FA incorporation into TAG, with long lasting increases in acyl-CoA synthetase long 1 (ACSL1) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (DGAT2), and (b) decreases in lipolysis and FA β-oxidation that paralleled a prolonged drop in adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL).

https://openalex.org/W1999668576,"An amputated salamander limb regenerates the correct number of segments. Models explaining limb regeneration were largely distinct from those for limb development, despite the presence of common patterning molecules. Intercalation has been an important concept to explain salamander limb regeneration, but clear evidence supporting or refuting this model was lacking. In the intercalation model, the first blastema cells acquire fingertip identity, creating a gap in positional identity that triggers regeneration of the intervening region from the stump. We used HOXA protein analysis and transplantation assays to show that axolotl limb blastema cells acquire positional identity in a proximal-to-distal sequence. Therefore, intercalation is not the primary mechanism for segment formation during limb regeneration in this animal. Patterning in development and regeneration uses similar mechanisms."

Formation of these pores results in the release of apoptotic factors including cytochrome c from the intermembrane space into the cytoplasm, where they initiate the cascade of events that lead to cell death. Using the site-directed spin labeling method of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we have determined the conformational changes that occur in BAK when the protein targets to the membrane and forms pores. The data showed that helices α1 and α6 disengage from the rest of the domain, leaving helices α2-α5 as a folded unit. Helices α2-α5 were shown to form a dimeric structure, which is structurally homologous to the recently reported BAX “BH3-in-groove homodimer.” Furthermore, the EPR data and a chemical cross-linking study demonstrated the existence of a hitherto unknown interface between BAK BH3-in-groove homodimers in the oligomeric BAK.

Some β-1,3-glucanases have already been structurally and biochemically characterized, but very few from organisms that are in contact with genuine laminarin, the storage polysaccharide of brown algae. Here we report the heterologous expression and subsequent biochemical and structural characterization of ZgLamAGH16 from Zobellia galactanivorans, the first GH16 laminarinase from a marine bacterium associated with seaweeds. ZgLamAGH16 contains a unique additional loop, compared with other GH16 laminarinases, which is composed of 17 amino acids and gives a bent shape to the active site cleft of the enzyme.

Storage 1,3-β-glucans are particularly well distributed in marine algae, and these algal polysaccharides are structurally diverse. Euglenoid microalgae (Excavata phylum) store carbon as paramylon, a linear 1,3-β-glucan that is deposited as semicrystalline granules in their cytosol (3Clarke A.E. Stone B.A. Structure of the paramylon from Euglena gracilis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 44: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The storage polysaccharides of haptophyte phytoplanktons consist of β-1,3- and β-1,6-linked glucose polymers, but they are mainly composed of β-1,3-linkages in Phaeocystales (4Janse I. van Rijssel M. van Hall P.J.

Soluble 1,3-β-glucans with occasional β-1,6-linked branches are the hallmark storage compounds of the Stramenopile phylum, which includes diatoms (phytoplanktons), the multicellular brown algae, and the nonphotosynthetic phytopathogens Oomycetes. Diatoms and Oomycetes produce 1,3–1,6-β-glucans only constituted by glucose moieties, which are referred to as chrysolaminarin (6Beattie A. Hirst E.L. Percival E.

The storage polysaccharide of brown algae called laminarin, in reference to the Laminaria genus (kelp), has a slightly different structure. Like chrysolaminarin and mycolaminarin, it is a small vacuolar polymer that contains on average 25 glucosyl residues and some occasional β-1,6-linked branches (8Percival E.G. Ross A.G. The constitution of laminarin. Part II. The soluble laminarin of Laminaria digitata.J. Chem. Soc. 1951; : 720-726Crossref Google Scholar). However, laminarin has the particularity to be composed of two series, the minor G series, which only contains glucose residues, and the more abundant M series, which displays a d-mannitol residue at the reducing end (9Read S.M.

The unique presence of mannitol in laminarin is explained by a horizontal gene transfer event between the common ancestor of brown algae and an ancestral actinobacterium. This horizontal gene transfer event, which occurred after the divergence from Oomycetes and diatoms, had a major impact on the evolution of brown algae, resulting in the acquisition of the mannitol metabolism (2Michel G.

Flavobacteria are also found to be associated to macroalgae, and some species are specialists in the degradation of high molecular weight organic matter (19Thomas F. Hehemann J.H. Rebuffet E. Czjzek M. Michel G. Environmental and gut bacteroidetes. The food connection.Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2: 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). This is the case with Zobellia galactanivorans, which is a model microorganism for the bioconversion of algal polysaccharides. This marine flavobacterium isolated from the red alga Delesseria sanguinea in Roscoff (20Barbeyron T. L'Haridon S. Corre E. Kloareg B. Potin P.

However, Z. galactanivorans is also able to metabolize some polysaccharides from brown algae, such as alginate. Indeed, this microorganism possesses two alginolytic operons induced by the presence of alginate (26Thomas F. Barbeyron T. Tonon T. Génicot S. Czjzek M. Michel G. Characterization of the first alginolytic operons in a marine bacterium.

Lundqvist L.C. Jam M. Jeudy A. Barbeyron T. Sandström C. Michel G. Czjzek M.

Chem. 2013; 288: 23021-23037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Z. galactanivorans grows with brown algal laminarin as its sole carbon source, and its genome contains five putative laminarinases: four of the family GH16 and one of the family GH64. This enzymatic diversity may seem surprising at first sight, considering that laminarin is a small, soluble polysaccharide. It is difficult to predict whether these enzymes have redundant or complementary activities or whether they match the biological diversity of 1,3-β-glucans present in the sea. Moreover, some laminarinases are also known to be active on 1,3–1,4-β-glucans, adding another degree of complexity to the characterization of this group of enzymes. As a first step to an in depth understanding of the laminarin utilization system of Z. galactanovorans, we report here the biochemical and structural analysis of its first GH16 laminarinase, ZgLamA. Except when mentioned, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The gene encoding the putative laminarinase ZgLamA (locus identifier: Zobellia_2431, GenBankTM accession number CAZ96583) was cloned as by Groisillier et al. (28Groisillier A. Hervé C. Jeudy A.

Taking advantage of high throughput cloning and expression strategies for the post-genomic analysis of marine organisms.Microb. Cell Fact. 2010; 9: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers were designed to amplify the coding region corresponding to the catalytic module of LamA (forward primer ggggggggatccgcctttaataccttagtgttttcaga, reverse primer cccccccaattgttattgatagatccttacatagtctatttc) by PCR from Z. galactanivorans genomic DNA. After digestion with the restriction enzymes BamHI and MfeI, the purified PCR product was ligated using the T4 DNA ligase into the expression vector pFO4 predigested by BamHI and EcoRI, resulting in a recombinant protein with a N-terminal hexahistidine tag (plasmid pLamAcat). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α strain for storage and in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain for protein expression. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the previous plasmid. The two putative catalytic residues Glu-269 and Glu-274 were replaced either by a serine or an alanine (mutant E269A: forward primer tggcccgcatgcggcgcaattgacattctggaa, reverse primer ttccagaatgtcaattgcgccgcatgcgggcca; mutant E269S: forward primer tggcccgcatgcggctcaattgacattctggaa, reverse primer ttccagaatgtcaattgagccgcatgcgggcca; mutant E274A: forward primer gaaattgacattctggcacaaaacggctgggac, reverse primer gtcccagccgttttgtgccagaatgtcaatttc; and mutant E274S: forward primer gaaattgacattctgtcacaaaacggctgggac, reverse primer gtcccagccgttttgtgacagaatgtcaatttc). Mutant plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the mutation occurred at the correct position. These variant plasmids were also transformed into E. coli DH5α strain for storage and in E. coli BL21(DE3) strains for protein expression. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the plasmid pLamAcat were cultivated at 20 °C in a 1-liter autoinduction ZYP 5052 medium (29Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein. Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μg·ml−1 ampicillin. Cultures were stopped when the cell growth reached the stationary phase and were centrifuged for 35 min at 4 °C at 3,000 × g. The cells were resuspended in a 20 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole). An anti-proteases mixture (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) and 0.1 mg/ml of DNase were added. The cells were disrupted in a French press. After centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto a 10-ml Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) previously charged with 100 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A (90 ml), and the protein was eluted with 60 ml of linear gradient between buffer A and buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole) with a flow rate at 1 ml·min−1. The different fractions (1 ml each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions corresponding to a single band at the expected size (28 kDa) were pooled (47 ml) and were concentrated by ultrafiltration on an Amicon membrane (10-kDa cutoff) (30 ml at 9 mg·ml−1). An aliquot of 5 ml (9 mg·ml−1) was loaded onto a 120-ml Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) column previously equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl). The protein was eluted using between 70 and 80 ml of buffer C, and the purity of the fractions was checked by SDS-PAGE. A calibration curve was also used to determine the oligomerization state of ZgLamAGH16. The mutant protein ZgLamAGH16-E269S was produced by the same procedure and was purified by a single step of metal affinity chromatography as described above. Buffer A was composed of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (10–600 mm) with a flow rate at 1 ml·min−1. ZgLamAGH16-E269S was dialyzed (molecular weight cutoff, 6–8,000; Spectrum Laboratories) to eliminate imidazole. Finally, ZgLamAGH16 and ZgLamAGH16-E269S were concentrated by ultrafiltration on an Amicon membrane (10-kDa cutoff) to 10 and 14.6 mg·ml−1, respectively. In addition, the proteins were filtrated on an Ultra free Durapore PVDF 0.1-μm membrane before crystallization screening. The thermostability of ZgLamAGH16 was studied by dynamic light scattering. A solution of 50 μl of ZgLamAGH16 at 10 mg·ml−1 was filtered on a 0.2-μm membrane. Using a Zetasizer Nano instrument (Malvern), the protein solution was heated from 10 to 70 °C in steps of 1 °C during a total period of 12 h, and the hydrodynamic gyration radius (Rg) was measured at each degree. The denaturation temperature was determined as the point of sharp change in gyration radius. The hydrolytic activities of the purified ZgLamAGH16 and ZgLamAGH16-E269S were measured by the ferricyanide reducing sugar assay (30Kidby D.K. Davidson D.J. A convenient ferricyanide estimation of reducing sugars in the nanomole range.Anal. Biochem. 1973; 55: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) on different β-glucans: laminarin from Laminaria digitata (0.1% w/v), mixed linked glucan (MLG) 4The abbreviations used are:MLGmixed linked glucanANTS8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acidFACEfluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresisPDBProtein Data Bank. from barley, curdlan from Alcaligenes faecalis, and paramylon from Euglena gracilis (all at 0.2% w/v). Laminarin is a small polysaccharide and has a large amount of reducing ends; thus this substrate was reduced prior to use. 70 mg of NaBH4 were added to 10 ml of laminarin (20 mg·ml−1), and the mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 3 days. The solution was acidified by adding concentrated acetic acid, drop by drop, until H2 release stopped. 40 ml of absolute ethanol were added, and after centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of absolute ethanol. This washing step was repeated twice, and the pellet was finally dried in vacuum (SpeedVac). mixed linked glucan 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis Protein Data Bank. Reduced laminarin was hydrolyzed by 0.7 μm of purified enzyme in a 1 ml of buffer C at 40 °C for 30 min. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (40 μl) were taken at T0, 10 min, and 30 min and added to 200 μl of 5× ferricyanide reagent. The samples were boiled at 95 °C for 15 min and cooled to 20 °C before absorbance measurement at 420 nm. All experiments were undertaken in triplicate. A calibration curve with 0–3.33 mm (0, 0.278, 0.556, 1.11, 1.67, 2.22, 2.78, 3.33) glucose was used to calculate the amount of released reducing ends as glucose-reducing end equivalents. The activity of ZgLamAGH16 on MLG, curdlan, and paramylon was measured similarly, except that the reactions were monitored for 15 h. Aliquots were taken at T0, 10 min, 1 h, and 15 h. The pH optimum for laminarin hydrolysis was determined as follows: 0.06% (w/v) of laminarin were hydrolyzed by 10 nm of ZgLamAGH16 in a 1-ml reaction mixture at 40 °C for 10 min. The following different buffers (at 100 mm) were tested with the pH varying from 4 to 9 by 0.5 increments of pH units: phosphate citrate (pH 4–6), MOPS (pH 6–7.5), Tris-HCl (pH 7.5–8.5), and glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5–9). Released reducing ends were measured as described above, except that aliquots of reaction mixture (40 μl) were taken every 2 min. The kinetic parameters of ZgLamAGH16 on reduced laminarin and MLG were determined using 10 nm of enzyme in a reaction mixture of 500 μl at optimal temperature and pH. The amount of released reducing ends was measured as above. For each substrate, five concentrations were used: 0.06% (w/v), 0.12%, 0.24%, 0.48%, and 0.96% for laminarin and 0.05% (w/v), 0.1%, 0.15%, 0.2%, and 0.25% for MLG. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (40 μl) were taken every 2 min for 10 min for laminarin and every 15 min for 1 h for MLG. For each substrate, the Km and kcat were determined from a Lineweaver-Burk plot. 0.5% (w/v) of laminarin was hydrolyzed using 100 nm of ZgLamAGH16 in a reaction mixture of 500 μl of glycine buffer, pH 8.5, at 20 °C. An aliquot of 20 μl (100 μg of oligosaccharides) was taken at 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, and 1 h. The samples were boiled to inactivate the enzyme and then dried in vacuum (SpeedVac). The FACE experiment was undertaken as previously described (31Jackson P. The use of polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis for the high-resolution separation of reducing saccharides labelled with the fluorophore 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulphonic acid. Detection of picomolar quantities by an imaging system based on a cooled charge-coupled device.Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oligosaccharides were mixed to 2 μl of 0.15 m 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS) and 5 μl of 1 m NaBH3CN. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for at least 3 h and dried in vacuum (SpeedVac). The oligosaccharides were resuspended in 20 μl of 25% glycerol, and 10 μl (50 μg) were loaded into a 36% acrylamide gel. The migration was undertaken at 200 V at 4 °C and with a 1× migration buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5). The experiment was repeated using 0.5% (w/v) of MLG and 4.5 μm ZgLamAGH16. The reaction mixture was incubated at 40 °C, and an aliquot of 20 μl was taken at 2, 5, 15, and 30 min. 100 μg of different commercial linear 1,3-β-d-glucans (Megazyme) (trisaccharide, tetrasaccharide, pentasaccharide, and hexasaccharide) were hydrolyzed using 4.5 μm of ZgLamAGH16 in a reaction mixture of 100 μl of glycine buffer, pH 8.5, at 40 °C for 12 h. For each sample, an aliquot containing 50 μg of oligosaccharides were treated as mentioned above. 5 μl (12.5 μg) were loaded into a 36% acrylamide gel. A glucan tetrasaccharide containing two β-1,4-linkages separated by one β-1,3-linkage (G4G3G4G) was also purchased from Megazyme. Three samples of this substrate at 50 μg were labeled with ANTS as previously described. One of them was used as control. The second sample was resuspended in a reaction mixture of 50 μl containing 4.5 μm of ZgLamAGH16 and glycine buffer, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 30 min. The same experiment was undertaken on the third sample, except that ZgLamAGH16 was first inactivated by heating. In parallel, 100 μg of nonlabeled G4G3G4G was hydrolyzed by ZgLamAGH16 at 37 °C for 30 min. After the enzymatic reaction, an aliquot containing 50 μg of oligosaccharides (reaction products) was labeled as mentioned above. A sample of 50 μg of glucose was also labeled with ANTS and was used as control. 10 μl (25 μg) of each samples were loaded onto a 36% acrylamide gel. Crystallization screening was undertaken with the nanodrop robot Honeybee (Cartesian) using the commercial screens PACT and JCSG+ (Qiagen). The initial crystallization conditions of ZgLamAGH16 were manually optimized, and single crystals were obtained as follows: 2 μl of enzyme at 10 mg·ml−1 were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 24% PEG 3350 and 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.2, in hanging drops at 4 °C. Single crystals of ZgLamAGH16-E269S in complex with laminarin oligosaccharides were obtained from 2 μl of the mixture enzyme/oligosaccharides (13.3 mg·ml−1 of enzyme, 5 mm of purified hexasaccharides) that were added to 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 100 mm MIB buffer, pH 4.0 (sodium malonate, imidazole, and boric acid), and 19% of PEG 1500 in hanging drops at 20 °C. Single crystals of ZgLamAGH16-E269S in complex with MLG trisaccharides were obtained from 2 μl of the mixture enzyme/oligosaccharides (11.7 mg·ml−1 of enzyme, 0.04% (w/v) of MLG degradation products) that were added to 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 100 mm MIB buffer, pH 4.0, 17% of PEG 1500, and 10% of glycerol in hanging drops at 12 °C. Prior to flash-freezing in a nitrogen stream at 100 K, single crystals were quickly soaked in the same crystallization solution supplemented with 10, 20, or 12% glycerol, respectively. Diffraction data for ZgLamAGH16 were collected on Beamline ID23-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The diffraction data for the two complexes, ZgLamAGH16-E269S·laminarin and ZgLamAGH16-E269S·MLG, were collected on Beamline ID29 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility). X-ray diffraction data were integrated using Mosflm (32Leslie A.G. The integration of macromolecular diffraction data.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and scaled with Scala (33Weiss M.S. Sicker T. Djinovic-Carugo K. Hilgenfeld R.

The structure of ZgLamAGH16 was determined by molecular replacement with MolRep (34Vagin A. Teplyakov A. MOLREP. An automated program for molecular replacement.J. Appl.

For both complexes of ZgLamAGH16-E269S, the structures were also determined by molecular replacement, but using the coordinates of the chain A of ZgLamAGH16.

https://openalex.org/W2079026009,"The phytochrome superfamily of photoreceptors exploits reversible light-driven changes in the bilin chromophore to initiate a variety of signaling cascades. The nature of these alterations and how they impact the protein moiety remain poorly resolved and might include several species-specific routes. Here, we provide a detailed picture of photoconversion for the photosensing cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenylyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) domain from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (Te) PixJ, a member of the cyanobacteriochrome clade. Solution NMR structures of the blue light-absorbing dark state Pb and green light-absorbing photoactivated state Pg, combined with paired crystallographic models, revealed that the bilin and GAF domain dynamically transition via breakage of the C10/Cys-494 thioether bond, opposite rotations of the A and D pyrrole rings, sliding of the bilin in the GAF pocket, and the appearance of an extended region of disorder that includes Cys-494. Changes in GAF domain backbone dynamics were also observed that are likely important for inter-domain signal propagation. Taken together, photoconversion of T. elongatus PixJ from Pb to Pg involves complex structural changes within the GAF domain pocket that transduce light into a mechanical signal, many aspects of which should be relevant to others within the extended phytochrome superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2000844264,"Proinflammatory and pro-angiogenic chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) contributes to ovarian cancer progression through its induction of tumor cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Proteasome inhibition by bortezomib, which has been used as a frontline therapy in multiple myeloma, has shown only limited effectiveness in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. However, the responsible mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that proteasome inhibition dramatically increases the IL-8 expression and release in ovarian cancer cells. The responsible mechanism involves an increased nuclear accumulation of IκB kinase β (IKKβ) and an increased recruitment of the nuclear IKKβ, p65-phosphorylated at Ser-536, and the transcription factor early growth response-1 (EGR-1) to the endogenous IL-8 promoter. Coimmunoprecipitation studies identified the nuclear EGR-1 associated with IKKβ and with p65, with preferential binding to S536P-p65. Both IKKβ activity and EGR-1 expression are required for the increased IL-8 expression induced by proteasome inhibition in ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly, in multiple myeloma cells the IL-8 release is not increased by bortezomib. Together, these data indicate that the increased IL-8 release may represent one of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the decreased effectiveness of proteasome inhibition in ovarian cancer treatment and identify IKKβ and EGR-1 as potential new targets in ovarian cancer combination therapies.

Ovarian cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death in women. Because most ovarian cancers relapse and become drug-resistant, the survival rates remain low. Progression of ovarian cancer has been associated with the increased expression of proinflammatory and proangiogenic chemokines, such as IL-8, which contribute to cancer development through their induction of tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis (1Xu L.

Nevertheless, BZ has been considered in combination with other therapies, especially cisplatin, as it prevents the cisplatin-induced degradation of cisplatin influx transporter, resulting in enhanced cisplatin uptake and tumor killing (31Jandial D.D.

Thus, understanding the mechanisms responsible for the resistance of ovarian carcinoma and other solid tumors to proteasome inhibition may lead to the development of more effective combination therapies. We have recently shown that in metastatic prostate cancer cells, bortezomib increases the IL-8 expression (33Manna S. Singha B. Phyo S.A. Gatla H.R. Chang T.P. Sanacora S. Ramaswami S. Vancurova I. Proteasome inhibition by bortezomib increases IL-8 expression in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. The role of IKKα.J. Immunol. 2013; 191: 2837-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism of BZ resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Here we show that in ovarian carcinoma cells, proteasome inhibition also increases the expression and release of IL-8. However, the mechanism is different from prostate cancer cells and involves an increased nuclear accumulation of IKKβ and a gene-specific recruitment of IKKβ, Ser-536-phosphorylated p65, and the transcription factor early growth response-1 (EGR-1) to the endogenous IL-8 promoter. Interestingly, however, we found that in contrast to prostate and ovarian cancer cells, BZ does not increase the IL-8 release in multiple myeloma cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the increased IL-8 release induced by proteasome inhibition may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for the decreased effectiveness of BZ in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors and suggest that targeting IKKβ and EGR-1may lead to new combination therapies for ovarian cancer. Purified polyclonal antibodies against human IκBα (sc-371), p65 NFκB (sc-372), Ser-536-phosphorylated p65 NFκB (sc-33020), p50 NFκB (sc-7178), EGR-1 (sc-189), IKKα (SC-7218), IKKβ (sc-8014), and lamin B (sc-6216) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Purified polyclonal antibody against lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 20-LG22) was from Fitzgerald Industries International (Concord, MA), and actin antibody was from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Bortezomib was obtained from ChemieTek (Indianapolis, IN). MG132 and the IKK inhibitors PS-1145 and Bay-117082 were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were molecular biology grade and were from Sigma. All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). Ovarian cancer OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Multiple myeloma IM-9 and RPMI-8226 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Before treatment, cells were seeded (5 × 105 cells/ml) for 24 h in 6-well plates and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Bortezomib, MG132, and IKK inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and stored at −80 °C. An equivalent volume of DMSO was used in all experiments as a solvent control. Nuclear (NE) and cytoplasmic extracts (CE) were prepared as described previously (34Vu H.Y. Juvekar A. Ghosh C.

Contamination of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, respectively, was determined by Western analysis using LDH and lamin B as specific markers. Denatured proteins were separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotting analysis was performed as described (36Ghosh C.C. Ramaswami S. Juvekar A. Vu H.Y. Galdieri L. Davidson D.

Activity of the 20 S catalytic proteasomal core unit was measured in whole cell extracts by using the 20 S Proteasome Activity Assay kit (Chemicon, APT280; Temecula, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min on ice, and the lysates were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The cell lysates were incubated (2 h, 37 °C) with a labeled substrate, LLVY-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, and the cleavage activity was monitored by detection of the free fluorophore 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin using a fluorescence plate reader (Berthold Mithras LB940, Berthold Technologies) at 355/460 nm. Total RNA was isolated by using RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The iScript one-step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) was used as a supermix, and 20 ng/μl RNA was used as template on a Bio-Rad MyIQ Single Color Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The primers used for quantification of IL-8, CCL2, CXCL5, IL-6, TNFα, and actin mRNA were purchased from SA Biosciences (Frederick, MD). Cytokine release was measured in cell culture supernatants by commercially available ELISA kits (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described (36Ghosh C.C. Ramaswami S. Juvekar A. Vu H.Y. Galdieri L. Davidson D. Vancurova I. Gene-specific repression of proinflammatory cytokines in stimulated human macrophages by nuclear IκBα.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 3685-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human EGR-1 (sc-29303) and non-silencing (sc-37007) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Before transfection, cells were seeded into a 6-well plate and incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in antibiotic-free RPMI medium supplement with 20% FBS for 24 h to 80% confluence. For each transfection, 80 pmol of either non-silencing siRNA-A control or EGR-1 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. The cells were transfected for 6 h in siRNA transfection medium (sc-36868) with siRNA transfection reagent (sc-29528) according to manufacturer's instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After transfection, fresh medium with antibiotics was added, and the cells were grown for 24 h before BZ treatment. ChIP analyses were performed as described (37Ramaswami S. Manna S. Juvekar A. Kennedy S. Vancura A. Vancurova I. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of NFκB transcriptional regulation by nuclear IκBα in human macrophages.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 809: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Proteins and DNA were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde to the growth medium to a final concentration of 1% for 15 min at 37 °C, and glycine was added at a final concentration of 0.125 m to neutralize formaldehyde. Cells were washed with PBS containing protease inhibitors and collected by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended in SDS lysis buffer, incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, and sonicated. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant extracts were diluted with ChIP dilution buffer and precleared with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies. After immunoprecipitation, the samples were incubated with protein A/G-agarose for 1 h, and the immune complexes were collected by centrifugation (150 × g at 4 °C), washed, and eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. After reversing the cross-linking, proteins were digested with proteinase K, and the samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by precipitation with ethanol. The pellets were resuspended in nuclease-free water and subjected to real time PCR. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR (25 μl reaction mixture) using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix and the Bio-Rad MyIQ Single Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Each immunoprecipitation was performed four times using different chromatin samples, and the occupancy was calculated by using the ChIP-qPCR Human IGX1A Negative Control Assay (SA Biosciences) as a negative control and corrected for the efficiency of the primers, which detect specific genomic DNA sequences within ORF-free intergenic regions or “promoter deserts” lacking any known or predicted structural genes. The primers used for real time PCR were the following: IL-8, forward (5′-GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAATC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTTGTGTGCTCTGCTGTCTC-3′); TNFα, forward (5′-CGCTTCCTCCAGATGAGCTT-3′) and reverse (5′-TGCTGTCCTTGCTGAGGGA-3′); IL-6, forward (5′-CCTCAGACATCTCCAGTCCT-3′) and reverse (5′-AATGACGACCTAAGCTGCAC-3′); CCL2, forward (5′-CCCAGTATCTGGAATGCAGG-3′) and reverse (5′-TCTGCCTCCCACTTCTGCT-3′); CXCL5, forward (5′-CCCAACCTCTTCTTTCCACAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAGCGAAGATTGGAGGATC-3′). Nuclear extracts were prepared by using Active Motif's Nuclear Complex Co-IP kit (Active Motif, 54001; Carlsbad, CA) as described previously (34Vu H.Y. Juvekar A. Ghosh C. Ramaswami S. Le D.H. Vancurova I. Proteasome inhibitors induce apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by inducing nuclear translocation of IκBα.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 475: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The nuclear extracts were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with EGR-1 (sc-189X) or control pre-immune IgG (sc-2027) antibodies that had been cross-linked with A/G Plus Agarose (sc-2003). After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with 1 m glycine buffer, pH 2.5, followed by neutralization with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The samples were boiled for 5 min in 5× SDS sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS gels, and detected by using EGR-1-, p65-, S536P-p65-, IKKβ-, and IKKα-specific antibodies. The results represent at least three independent experiments. Numerical results are presented as the means ± S.E. Data were analyzed by using an InStat software package (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was evaluated by using the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. To understand the mechanism of how proteasome inhibition regulates the NFκB-dependent transcription in ovarian cancer cells, we first analyzed the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of NFκB proteins in human ovarian cancer OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells treated with increasing concentrations of bortezomib. Both NFκB p65 and p50 proteins were localized predominantly in the nucleus in OVCAR3 (Fig. 1A) and SKOV3 (Fig. 1B) cells; this is consistent with the high constitutive NFκB activity in these cells. Cell incubation with increasing BZ concentrations for 24 h further increased the nuclear levels of p65 both in OVCAR3 (Fig. 1A) and SKOV3 (Fig. 1B) cells, likely caused by inhibition of the previously reported p65 proteasomal degradation (38Saccani S. Marazzi I. Beg A.A. Natoli G. Degradation of promoter-bound p65/RelA is essential for the prompt termination of the NFκB response.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition to p65, BZ induced the nuclear translocation and accumulation of IκBα in OVCAR3 (Fig. 1A) and SKOV3 (Fig. 1B) cells. This was consistent with our previous studies demonstrating that in prostate cancer and leukemia cells, proteasome inhibition induces translocation of IκBα from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in a gene-specific repression of NFκB-dependent transcription (33Manna S.

Cancer Res. 2011; 9: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast to p65 or IκBα, BZ did not have any pronounced effect on the nuclear levels of p50 in OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). BZ also did not have any effect on actin levels or on the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of LDH and lamin, which were used as cytoplasmic and nuclear markers, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). To verify that BZ inhibits the proteasome activity in ovarian cancer cells, we measured the activity of the 20 S proteasome catalytic subunit in whole cell extracts prepared from OVCAR3 cells incubated 24 h with increasing concentrations of BZ. As shown in Fig. 1C, 0.1 μm BZ, which approximately corresponds to the clinically used BZ concentrations in cancer patients (39Levêque D. Carvalho M.C. Maloisel F. Clinical pharmacokinetics of bortezomib.In Vivo. 2007; 21: 273-278PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited ∼90% of the proteasome activity. Importantly, the nuclear accumulation of p65 NFκB and IκBα induced by proteasome inhibition in ovarian cancer cells was not limited to BZ, as MG132 had a similar effect (Fig. 1D). To determine whether the increased nuclear p65 accumulation induced by proteasome inhibition was associated with increased expression of NFκB-dependent genes in ovarian cancer cells, we first analyzed mRNA levels of IL-8, IL-6, and TNFα. BZ significantly increased the IL-8 expression in OVCAR3 (Fig. 2A) and SKOV3 (Fig. 2B) cells without having any significant effect on mRNA levels of TNFα or IL-6. Compared with untreated cells, the IL-8 expression induced by 0.1 μm BZ (24 h) increased ∼20-fold in OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 2A) and 60-fold in SKOV3 cells (Fig. 2B). The increased IL-8 mRNA expression induced by proteasome inhibition was time-dependent (Fig. 2C). Because the proximal NFκB binding site in human IL-8 promoter (GGAATTTCC) differs from the NFκB binding sites in IL-6 (GGGATTTTC) and TNFα (GGGTATCCT) promoters by having A instead of G in the third position, we searched for other NFκB-regulated genes that would have the same NFκB binding site as IL-8. We found two genes that have the same NFκB binding sequence as IL-8: the pro-survival and pro-angiogenic chemokines CCL2 (also called monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MCP-1) and CXCL5 (epithelial-neutrophil activating peptide (ENA-78)). Interestingly, both CCL2 and CXCL5 mRNA levels were also significantly increased by BZ in OVCAR3 (Fig. 2, A and C) and SKOV3 (Fig. 2B) cells. To determine whether other proteasome inhibitors also increase the IL-8, CCL2, and CXCL5 mRNA levels in ovarian cancer cells, we tested the effect of MG132 on cytokine gene expression in OVCAR3 cells. Although BZ is a specific inhibitor of the β5 subunit chymotrypsin-like activity, MG132 targets all three proteasomal β subunits and their activities (25Shah J.J. Orlowski R.Z.

https://openalex.org/W1983906332,"Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by amino acids is mediated in part by the Rag GTPases, which bind the raptor subunit of mTORC1 in an amino acid-stimulated manner and promote mTORC1 interaction with Rheb-GTP, the immediate activator. Here we examine whether the ability of amino acids to regulate mTORC1 binding to Rag and mTORC1 activation is due to the regulation of Rag guanyl nucleotide charging. Rag heterodimers in vitro exhibit a very rapid, spontaneous exchange of guanyl nucleotides and an inability to hydrolyze GTP. Mutation of the Rag P-loop corresponding to Ras(Ser-17) abolishes guanyl nucleotide binding. Such a mutation in RagA or RagB inhibits, whereas in RagC or RagD it enhances, Rag heterodimer binding to mTORC1. The binding of wild-type and mutant Rag heterodimers to mTORC1 in vitro parallels that seen with transient expression, but binding to mTORC1 in vitro is entirely independent of Rag guanyl nucleotide charging. HeLa cells stably overexpressing wild-type or P-loop mutant RagC exhibit unaltered amino acid regulation of mTORC1. Despite amino acid-independent raptor binding to Rag, mTORC1 is inhibited by amino acid withdrawal as in parental cells. Rag heterodimers extracted from (32)P-labeled whole cells, or just from the pool associated with the lysosomal membrane, exhibit constitutive [(32)P]GTP charging that is unaltered by amino acid withdrawal. Thus, amino acids promote mTORC1 activation without altering Rag GTP charging. Raptor binding to Rag, although necessary, is not sufficient for mTORC1 activation. Additional amino acid-dependent steps couple Rag-mTORC1 to Rheb-GTP."
https://openalex.org/W2079490376,"Proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are carriers of high-energy metabolites such as lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies and are expressed in most tissues. It has previously been shown that transport activity of MCT1 and MCT4 is enhanced by the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) independent of its catalytic activity. We have now studied the influence of the extracellular, membrane-bound CAIV on transport activity of MCT1/4, heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Coexpression of CAIV with MCT1 and MCT4 resulted in a significant increase in MCT transport activity, even in the nominal absence of CO2/HCO3(-). CAIV-mediated augmentation of MCT activity was independent of the CAIV catalytic function, since application of the CA-inhibitor ethoxyzolamide or coexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant CAIV-V165Y did not suppress CAIV-mediated augmentation of MCT transport activity. The interaction required CAIV at the extracellular surface, since injection of CAIV protein into the oocyte cytosol did not augment MCT transport function. The effects of cytosolic CAII (injected as protein) and extracellular CAIV (expressed) on MCT transport activity, were additive. Our results suggest that intra- and extracellular carbonic anhydrases can work in concert to ensure rapid shuttling of metabolites across the cell membrane."

These enzymes possess complex metallocenters that are assembled by teams of proteins in multistep pathways. One essential accessory protein is the GTPase HypB, which is required for Ni(II) delivery to [NiFe]-hydrogenase and participates in urease maturation. Ni(II) or Zn(II) binding to a site embedded in the GTPase domain of HypB modulates the enzymatic activity, suggesting a mechanism of regulation. In this study, biochemical and structural analyses of H. pylori HypB (HpHypB) revealed an intricate link between nucleotide and metal binding. HpHypB nickel coordination, stoichiometry, and affinity were modulated by GTP and GDP, an effect not observed for zinc, and biochemical evidence suggests that His-107 coordination to nickel toggles on and off in a nucleotide-dependent manner. These results are consistent with the crystal structure of HpHypB loaded with Ni(II), GDP, and Pi, which reveals a nickel site distinct from that of zinc-loaded Methanocaldococcus jannaschii HypB as well as subtle changes to the protein structure. Furthermore, Cys-142, a metal ligand from the Switch II GTPase motif, was identified as a key component of the signal transduction between metal binding and the enzymatic activity. Finally, potassium accelerated the enzymatic activity of HpHypB but had no effect on the other biochemical properties of the protein. Altogether, this molecular level information about HpHypB provides insight into its cellular function and illuminates a possible mechanism of metal ion discrimination.

https://openalex.org/W2116199447,"Noncoding RNAs must function in the crowded environment of the cell. Previous small-angle x-ray scattering experiments showed that molecular crowders stabilize the structure of the Azoarcus group I ribozyme, allowing the ribozyme to fold at low physiological Mg(2+) concentrations. Here, we used an RNA cleavage assay to show that the PEG and Ficoll crowder molecules increased the biochemical activity of the ribozyme, whereas sucrose did not. Crowding lowered the Mg(2+) threshold at which activity was detected and increased total RNA cleavage at high Mg(2+) concentrations sufficient to fold the RNA in crowded or dilute solution. After correcting for solution viscosity, the observed reaction rate was proportional to the fraction of active ribozyme. We conclude that molecular crowders stabilize the native ribozyme and favor the active structure relative to compact inactive folding intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1974042040,"The currently available antithrombotic agents target the interaction of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (GPIIb-IIIa) with fibrinogen during platelet aggregation. Platelets also bind fibrin formed early during thrombus growth. It was proposed that inhibition of platelet-fibrin interactions may be a necessary and important property of αIIbβ3 antagonists; however, the mechanisms by which αIIbβ3 binds fibrin are uncertain. We have previously identified the γ370-381 sequence (P3) in the γC domain of fibrinogen as the fibrin-specific binding site for αIIbβ3 involved in platelet adhesion and platelet-mediated fibrin clot retraction. In the present study, we have demonstrated that P3 can bind to several discontinuous segments within the αIIb β-propeller domain of αIIbβ3 enriched with negatively charged and aromatic residues. By screening peptide libraries spanning the sequence of the αIIb β-propeller, several sequences were identified as candidate contact sites for P3. Synthetic peptides duplicating these segments inhibited platelet adhesion and clot retraction but not platelet aggregation, supporting the role of these regions in fibrin recognition. Mutant αIIbβ3 receptors in which residues identified as critical for P3 binding were substituted for homologous residues in the I-less integrin αMβ2 exhibited reduced cell adhesion and clot retraction. These residues are different from those that are involved in the coordination of the fibrinogen γ404-411 sequence and from auxiliary sites implicated in binding of soluble fibrinogen. These results map the binding of fibrin to multiple sites in the αIIb β-propeller and further indicate that recognition specificity of αIIbβ3 for fibrin differs from that for soluble fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W2047960556,"Canonical Wnt signaling and BMP promote the proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitors, respectively. However, the regulatory mechanism involved in the transition from proliferation to differentiation is unclear. Here, we show that Panx3 (pannexin 3) plays a key role in this transition by inhibiting the proliferation and promoting the cell cycle exit. Using primary calvarial cells and explants, C3H10T1/2 cells, and C2C12 cells, we found that Panx3 expression inhibited cell growth, whereas the inhibition of endogenous Panx3 expression increased it. We also found that the Panx3 hemichannel inhibited cell growth by promoting β-catenin degradation through GSK3β activation. Additionally, the Panx3 hemichannel inhibited cyclin D1 transcription and Rb phosphorylation through reduced cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling. Furthermore, the Panx3 endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) channel induced the transcription and phosphorylation of p21, through the calmodulin/Smad pathway, and resulted in the cell cycle exit. Our results reveal that Panx3 is a new regulator that promotes the switch from proliferation to differentiation of osteoprogenitors via multiple Panx3 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1973071352,"Here, we show that the expression of the Golgi-localized serine-threonine kinase protein kinase D3 (PKD3) is elevated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Using an antibody array, we identified PKD3 to trigger the activation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a main downstream target of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. Accordingly, PKD3 knockdown in TNBC cells led to reduced S6K1 phosphorylation, which was associated with impaired activation of mTORC1 at endolysosomal membranes, the accumulation of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor in and the recruitment of the autophagy marker light chain 3 to enlarged acidic vesicles. We further show that PKD3 depletion strongly inhibited cell spreading and proliferation of TNBC cells, identifying this kinase as a potential novel molecular therapeutic target in TNBC. Together, our data suggest that PKD3 in TNBC cells provides a molecular connection between the Golgi and endolysosomal compartments to enhance proliferative mTORC1-S6K1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1995845718,"Mammalian prion strains are believed to arise from the propagation of distinct conformations of the misfolded prion protein PrP(Sc). One key operational parameter used to define differences between strains has been conformational stability of PrP(Sc) as defined by resistance to thermal and/or chemical denaturation. However, the structural basis of these stability differences is unknown. To bridge this gap, we have generated two strains of recombinant human prion protein amyloid fibrils that show dramatic differences in conformational stability and have characterized them by a number of biophysical methods. Backbone amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments revealed that, in sharp contrast to previously studied strains of infectious amyloid formed from the yeast prion protein Sup35, differences in β-sheet core size do not underlie differences in conformational stability between strains of mammalian prion protein amyloid. Instead, these stability differences appear to be dictated by distinct packing arrangements (i.e. steric zipper interfaces) within the amyloid core, as indicated by distinct x-ray fiber diffraction patterns and large strain-dependent differences in hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics for histidine side chains within the core region. Although this study was limited to synthetic prion protein amyloid fibrils, a similar structural basis for strain-dependent conformational stability may apply to brain-derived PrP(Sc), especially because large strain-specific differences in PrP(Sc) stability are often observed despite a similar size of the PrP(Sc) core region."
https://openalex.org/W1998546722,"The activation of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) by pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme (PFL-AE) involves formation of a specific glycyl radical on PFL by the PFL-AE in a reaction requiring S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions on the oxygen-sensitive PFL-AE to determine the kinetics and equilibrium constant for its interaction with PFL. These experiments show that the interaction is very slow and rate-limited by large conformational changes. A novel AdoMet binding assay was used to accurately determine the equilibrium constants for AdoMet binding to PFL-AE alone and in complex with PFL. The PFL-AE bound AdoMet with the same affinity (∼6 μM) regardless of the presence or absence of PFL. Activation of PFL in the presence of its substrate pyruvate or the analog oxamate resulted in stoichiometric conversion of the [4Fe-4S](1+) cluster to the glycyl radical on PFL; however, 3.7-fold less activation was achieved in the absence of these small molecules, demonstrating that pyruvate or oxamate are required for optimal activation. Finally, in vivo concentrations of the entire PFL system were calculated to estimate the amount of bound protein in the cell. PFL, PFL-AE, and AdoMet are essentially fully bound in vivo, whereas electron donor proteins are partially bound."

Despite counting 18 members in humans, the identity of the physiological targets of the Asb proteins remains largely unexplored. To increase our understanding of the function of ASB proteins, we conducted a family-wide SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based protein/protein interaction analysis. This investigation led to the identification of novel as well as known ASB-associated proteins like Cullin 5 and Elongins B/C. We observed that several proteins can be bound by more than one Asb protein. The additional exploration of this phenomenon demonstrated that ASB-Cullin 5 complexes can oligomerize and provides evidence that Cullin 5 forms heterodimeric complexes with the Cullin 4a-DDB1 complex. We also demonstrated that ASB11 is a novel endoplasmic reticulum-associated ubiquitin ligase with the ability to interact and promote the ubiquitination of Ribophorin 1, an integral protein of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) glycosylation complex. Moreover, expression of ASB11 can increase Ribophorin 1 protein turnover in vivo. In summary, we provide a comprehensive protein/protein interaction data resource that can aid the biological and functional characterization of ASB ubiquitin ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2162159634,"NPP4 is a type I extracellular membrane protein on brain vascular endothelium inducing platelet aggregation via the hydrolysis of Ap3A, whereas NPP1 is a type II extracellular membrane protein principally present on the surface of chondrocytes that regulates tissue mineralization. To understand the metabolism of purinergic signals resulting in the physiologic activities of the two enzymes, we report the high resolution crystal structure of human NPP4 and explore the molecular basis of its substrate specificity with NPP1. Both enzymes cleave Ap3A, but only NPP1 can hydrolyze ATP. Comparative structural analysis reveals a tripartite lysine claw in NPP1 that stabilizes the terminal phosphate of ATP, whereas the corresponding region of NPP4 contains features that hinder this binding orientation, thereby inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, we show that NPP1 is unable to induce platelet aggregation at physiologic concentrations reported in human blood, but it could stimulate platelet aggregation if localized at low nanomolar concentrations on vascular endothelium. The combined studies expand our understanding of NPP1 and NPP4 substrate specificity and range and provide a rational mechanism by which polymorphisms in NPP1 confer stroke resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2052406310,"Enterocytes are the only cell type that must balance the de novo synthesis and absorption of cholesterol, although the coordinate regulation of these processes is not well understood. Our previous studies demonstrated that enterocytes respond to the pharmacological blockade of cholesterol absorption by ramping up de novo sterol synthesis through activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). Here, we genetically disrupt both Insig1 and Insig2 in the intestine, two closely related proteins that are required for the feedback inhibition of SREBP and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). This double knock-out was achieved by generating mice with an intestine-specific deletion of Insig1 using Villin-Cre in combination with a germ line deletion of Insig2. Deficiency of both Insigs in enterocytes resulted in constitutive activation of SREBP and HMGR, leading to an 11-fold increase in sterol synthesis in the small intestine and producing lipidosis of the intestinal crypts. The intestine-derived cholesterol accumulated in plasma and liver, leading to secondary feedback inhibition of hepatic SREBP2 activity. Pharmacological blockade of cholesterol absorption was unable to further induce the already elevated activities of SREBP-2 or HMGR in Insig-deficient enterocytes. These studies confirm the essential role of Insig proteins in the sterol homeostasis of enterocytes."

To explore the molecular nature of CS-56-labeled glycoproteins, we purified glycoproteins of the adult mouse cerebral cortex using a combination of anion-exchange, charge-transfer, and size-exclusion chromatographies. One of the purified proteins was identified as tenascin-R (TNR) by mass spectrometric analysis. When we compared TNR mRNA expression patterns with the distribution patterns of CS-56-positive cells, TNR mRNA was detected in CS-56-positive astrocytes. To examine the functions of TNR in astrocytes, we first confirmed that cultured astrocytes also expressed TNR protein. TNR knockdown by siRNA expression significantly reduced glutamate uptake in cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, expression of mRNA and protein of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (GLAST), which is a major component of astrocytic glutamate transporters, was reduced by TNR knockdown. Our results suggest that TNR is expressed in a subset of astrocytes and contributes to glutamate homeostasis by regulating astrocytic GLAST expression."
https://openalex.org/W2048859884,"The circadian clock drives the rhythmic expression of a broad array of genes that orchestrate metabolism, sleep wake behavior, and the immune response. Clock genes are transcriptional regulators engaged in the generation of circadian rhythms. The cold inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) guarantees high amplitude expression of clock. The cytokines TNF and TGFβ impair the expression of clock genes, namely the period genes and the proline- and acidic amino acid-rich basic leucine zipper (PAR-bZip) clock-controlled genes. Here, we show that TNF and TGFβ impair the expression of Cirbp in fibroblasts and neuronal cells. IL-1β, IL-6, IFNα, and IFNγ do not exert such effects. Depletion of Cirbp is found to increase the susceptibility of cells to the TNF-mediated inhibition of high amplitude expression of clock genes and modulates the TNF-induced cytokine response. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of cytokine-regulated expression of clock genes."

Cyanobacteria are a large group of oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes that are found in diverse ecological habitats. In many of these habitats, nitrogen is limiting and cyanobacteria are exposed to periods of severe nitrogen starvation (1Schwarz R. Forchhammer K. Acclimation of unicellular cyanobacteria to macronutrient deficiency. Emergence of a complex network of cellular responses.Microbiology. 2005; 151: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To survive under such conditions, they have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense and respond to nitrogen limitation, including induction of the systems for high-affinity uptake of nitrogen-containing compounds (2Forchhammer K. Global carbon/nitrogen control by PII signal transduction in cyanobacteria. From signals to targets.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). During nitrogen starvation, non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria may consume internal stores of nitrogen to prolong their growth. For example, the unicellular Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 uses cyanophycin (multi-l-arginyl-poly-[l-aspartic acid]), a non-ribosomally synthesized peptide consisting of equimolar quantities of arginine and aspartic acid, as a nitrogen source upon nitrogen starvation (3Allen M.M. Cyanobacterial cell inclusions.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). After cyanophycin is exhausted, cells degrade the phycobilisomes that are light-harvesting antennae composed of rod and core proteins to provide nitrogen, which leads to a color change of cells from blue-green to yellow-green, known as bleaching (4Grossman A.R. Schaefer M.R. Chiang G.G. Collier J.L. The phycobilisome, a light-harvesting complex responsive to environmental conditions.Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 725-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon reintroduction of nitrogen, cyanophycin is synthesized immediately, thus cyanophycin is considered as a dynamic nitrogen reservoir in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and many other cyanobacteria (5Li H. Sherman D.M. Bao S. Sherman L.A. Pattern of cyanophycin accumulation in nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.Arch.

The filamentous Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 produces heterocysts that are specialized cells for nitrogen fixation (6Zhang C.C. Laurent S. Sakr S. Peng L. Bédu S.

Microbiol. 2006; 59: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), whereas the unicellular Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 fixes nitrogen and accumulates cyanophycin granules under dark conditions (7Welsh E.A. Liberton M. Stöckel J. Loh T. Elvitigala T. Wang C. Wollam A. Fulton R.S. Clifton S.W. Jacobs J.M.

Macromol. 2007; 40: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that during nitrogen starvation, glycogen is accumulated in Synechocystis sp.

The main goal of this study was to investigate the regulatory role of NrrA in diverse cyanobacteria. We used a comparative genomic approach (16Rodionov D.A. Comparative genomic reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria.Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 3467-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) to identify NrrA-binding DNA motifs and reconstruct NrrA regulons in 15 diverse cyanobacterial species. The predicted members of NrrA regulons in most species are involved in glycogen catabolism, central carbon metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and protein degradation. A combination of in vivo and in vitro experimental techniques was used to validate the predicted direct target genes of NrrA in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Furthermore, the effect of NrrA deficiency on intracellular levels of arginine, cyanophycin, and glycogen was studied. Our results indicate that NrrA controls cyanophycin accumulation and glycogen catabolism in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Genome sequences of cyanobacteria analyzed in this study were obtained from GenBankTM. Identification of orthologs was performed using the BLASTP tool provided by NCBI (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L.

Comparative genomic reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria.Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 3467-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For identification of the conserved DNA-binding motif for NrrA, we started from training sets of known NrrA-regulated genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (11Azuma M. Osanai T. Hirai M.Y. Tanaka K. A response regulator Rre37 and an RNA polymerase sigma factor SigE represent two parallel pathways to activate sugar catabolism in a cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

NrrA, a nitrogen-regulated response regulator protein, controls glycogen catabolism in the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.J. Biol.

An iterative motif detection algorithm implemented in the RegPredict web-server (20Novichkov P.S. Rodionov D.A. Stavrovskaya E.D. Novichkova E.S. Kazakov A.E. Gelfand M.S. Arkin A.P. Mironov A.A. Dubchak I. RegPredict. An integrated system for regulon inference in prokaryotes by comparative genomics approach.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W299-W307Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was used to identify common regulatory DNA motifs in upstream regions of these genes. For each clade of NrrA proteins on the phylogenetic tree, a separate training gene set was used. A positional weight matrix was constructed for each identified motif and used to scan the genomes in this clade. Candidate NrrA-binding sites were identified using the RegPredict (20Novichkov P.S. Rodionov D.A. Stavrovskaya E.D. Novichkova E.S. Kazakov A.E. Gelfand M.S. Arkin A.P. Mironov A.A. Dubchak I. RegPredict.

Vinokurova N.P. Gelfand M.S. Software for analysis of bacterial genomes.Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 2000; 34: 222-231Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Scores of candidate sites were calculated as the sum of positional nucleotide weights. The score threshold was defined as the lowest score observed in the training set. Genes with candidate upstream binding sites that are high scored and/or conserved in two or more genomes were included in the NrrA regulon. Candidate sites associated with new regulon members were added to the training set, and the respective positional weight matrix describing a group-specific NrrA motif was rebuilt to improve search accuracy. The NrrA-binding DNA motifs were visualized as sequence logos using WebLogo (22Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. WebLogo. A sequence logo generator.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8238) Google Scholar). Functional annotations of the predicted regulon members were based on CyanoBase (23Nakao M. Okamoto S. Kohara M. Fujishiro T. Fujisawa T. Sato S. Tabata S. Kaneko T. Nakamura Y. CyanoBase. The cyanobacteria genome database update 2010.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D379-D381Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and its derivative with the nrrA gene inactivation were used in this study. Synechocystis strains were routinely grown in the BG-11 medium (24Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. Genetic assignments, strain histories and properties of pure cultures of cyanobacteria.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) containing 18 mm NaNO3 under continuous white light (∼70 μmol of photons m−2 s−1). Kanamycin (30 μg/ml) was added when needed. The photo-mixotrophic cultures were started with an optical density at 730 nm (A730) of about 0.05, and grown at 30 °C under continuous illumination in triplicates in 300-ml glass flasks with 100 ml of BG-11 liquid medium containing 5 mm NaNO3 and supplemented with 10 mm glucose (BG-11G). Cell growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 730 nm. For nitrogen deprivation and replenishment experiments, cells were grown in 100 ml of BG-11 medium to an A730 of about 1.0, washed with the nitrogen-free minimal medium (BG-11N0), and resuspended in 100 ml of BG-11N0 medium. The cultures were grown in triplicates in 300-ml glass flasks with shaking at 30 °C under light condition. After 12 h of nitrogen deprivation, 5 mm NaNO3 with or without 5 mm arginine was added to the culture, and cells were grown for another 12 h. Aliquots of the culture were harvested in the course of time for metabolite analyses. To construct the nrrA gene-inactivated mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, DNA fragments immediately upstream and downstream of the nrrA gene (sll1330) were amplified by PCR using the primers shown in supplemental Table S1. The upstream fragment was cloned between the SacI and BamHI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Agilent Technologies), and the downstream fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and SalI sites. A kanamycin resistance cassette from the plasmid pUC4K (25Taylor L.A. Rose R.E. A correction in the nucleotide sequence of the Tn903 kanamycin resistance determinant in pUC4K.Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 358Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) was inserted between the upstream and downstream fragments to form plasmid pKSnrrA. This plasmid was introduced into Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 according to Ref. 26Williams J.G.K. Construction of specific mutations in photosystem II photosynthetic reaction center by genetic engineering methods in Synechocystis 6803.Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (850) Google Scholar. The mutant was selected on BG-11 plates supplemented with kanamycin, and segregation was confirmed by PCR using the primers shown in supplemental Table S1. In the mutant, the region from +95 to +450 with respect to the translation start site of the nrrA gene (753 bp long) was replaced with the kanamycin resistance cassette. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and ground into powder. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Contaminant DNA was removed by DNase I (Takara) digestion. RNA (1 μg) was transcribed into cDNA with random primers using the ReverTra-Plus kit from TOYOBO. The product was quantified via real-time PCR using the Applied Biosystems 7300 PCR system. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Takara) and 0.3 μm gene-specific primers (as shown in supplemental Table S1). The PCR parameters were 1 cycle of 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 31 s. The accuracy of the PCR product was checked by melting curve analysis. The expression level of each gene was normalized with the value for the rnpB gene encoding RNase P subunit B, which was used as a reference gene with constitutive expression (27Vioque A. Analysis of the gene encoding the RNA subunit of ribonuclease P from cyanobacteria.Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6331-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Data were presented as the average of six measurements from two biological replicates, with the corresponding standard deviation. The nrrA genes (sll1330 and all4312) were PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, respectively, using the primers shown in supplemental Table S1. The PCR fragment was ligated into the expression vector pET28a cleaved by NdeI and BamHI. The resulting plasmid pET28a-nrrA was sequenced to exclude unwanted mutations in the nrrA gene and used to produce NrrA protein with an N-terminal His6 tag. For overproduction of NrrA proteins, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with plasmid pET28a-nrrA and cultivated in LB medium at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.8. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was incubated for another 18 h at 16 °C. After the cells were harvested, purification of NrrA by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography was performed as described previously (28Yang C. Rodionov D.A. Rodionova I.A. Li X. Osterman A.L. Glycerate 2-kinase of Thermotoga maritima and genomic reconstruction of related metabolic pathways.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The purified protein was run on a 12% SDS-PAGE to monitor its size and purity. The 200-bp DNA fragments in the promoter regions of individual genes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the sigE gene (alr4249) of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 were PCR-amplified using the primers shown in supplemental Table S1. Both forward and reverse primers were Cy5 fluorescence labeled at the 5′-end (Sangong Corp., Shanghai, China), and the PCR products were purified with a PCR purification kit (AXYGEN). Purified NrrA protein was incubated with the fluorescence-labeled DNA fragment (1 nm) in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.25 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.8 μg of bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA (nonspecific random-sequence competitor). After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction mixture was electrophoresed at 4 °C on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA for 1.5 h at 100 V. Fluorescence-labeled DNA on the gel was then detected by the Starion FLA-9000 (FujiFilm, Japan). Specificity of the NrrA-DNA interactions was tested by including a 200-fold excess of unlabeled target DNA (specific competitor) in binding reaction mixtures. Enzyme activities were measured in crude cell extracts from 25-ml culture aliquots. The cell pellets were washed and resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). After sonication, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for determination of enzyme activities and protein concentration. Glycogen phosphorylase activity was measured by monitoring the increase in NADPH concentration using phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-P dehydrogenase as coupling enzymes (29Fu J. Xu X. The functional divergence of two glgP homologues in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 260: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of the cell extract was added to 200 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NADP+, 1 unit of phosphoglucomutase, 6 units of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, and 1 g/liter of glycogen. The change in NADPH concentration was monitored at 340 nm using a Beckman DU-800 spectrophotometer. Glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase activity was measured by adding 10 μl of the cell extract to 200 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 4 mm glyceraldehyde-3-P, 10 mm EDTA, and 2 mm NAD+. The formation of NADH was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. N-Acetylornithine aminotransferase activity was determined by adding 10 μl of the cell extract to 200 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 4 mm NAD+, 20 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 3 mm acetylornithine, and 5 units of glutamate dehydrogenase (30Rajaram V.

Studies on substrate specificity and inhibitor binding.Proteins. 2008; 70: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The formation of NADH was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Argininosuccinate synthetase activity was assayed by coupling the formation of AMP to the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ through adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (31Schuegraf A. Ratner S. Warner R.C. Free energy changes of the argininosuccinate synthetase reaction and of the hydrolysis of the inner pyrophosphate bond of adenosine triphosphate.J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3597-3602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of the cell extract was added to 200 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 16 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 7.5 mm citrulline, 7.5 mm aspartate, 10 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 10 units of adenylate kinase, 4 units of pyruvate kinase, and 4 units of lactate dehydrogenase. The change in NADH absorbance was monitored at 340 nm. For analysis of extracellular metabolites, culture samples were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The glucose concentration was determined with an enzymatic test kit (r-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany). The nitrate concentration was measured with a colorimetric assay kit (Roche Applied Science). For determination of the intracellular arginine concentration, cells were harvested by centrifuging 20 ml of culture broth at 9,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min and resuspended in 10 ml of 80% (v/v) ethanol. Norleucine was added as an internal standard. After heating at 65 °C for 3 h, cell debris was removed from extracts by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min. The extracts were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Arginine in the extracts was derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate by incubating with 200 μl of the derivative reagent (Sigma) at room temperature for 45 min (32Mao H.M. Wei W. Xiong W.J. Lu Y.

Biochem. 2010; 43: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The resulting phenylisothiocyanate-arginine was quantitated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Agilent model 1260 instrument equipped with an Ultimate Amino Acid Column (4.6 × 250 mm; Welch, Shanghai, China) and a UV detector (Agilent) operated at 254 nm. The mobile phase solutions were pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the temperature of the column was kept at 40 °C. For determination of intracellular glycogen levels, cell pellets were harvested by centrifuging 1 ml of culture aliquots, resuspended in 100 μl of 3.5% (v/v) sulfuric acid and boiled for 40 min. The amount of glucose in the hydrolysate was determined using o-toluidine reagent and reading the absorbance at 635 nm (33Osanai T. Oikawa A. Azuma M. Tanaka K. Saito K. Hirai M.Y. Ikeuchi M.

Cyanophycin was isolated and purified using a previously published method with minor modifications (5Li H. Sherman D.M. Bao S. Sherman L.A. Pattern of cyanophycin accumulation in nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifuging 25 ml of culture aliquots and resuspending in 2 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed twice with distilled water and extracted by two successive treatments with 0.5 ml of 0.1 m HCl for 30 min at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was neutralized with 0.1 m NaOH. Cyanophycin that is insoluble at neutral pH was collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water, and solubilized in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m HCl. The cyanophycin content was measured with the Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The ratio of phycocyanin to chlorophyll levels was used as a measure of the phycocyanin content. Phycocyanin and chlorophyll levels were obtained spectrophotometry as described previously (34Arnon D.I. McSwain B.D. Tsujimoto H.Y. Wada K.

https://openalex.org/W1973966051,"Plastoquinone is a redox active lipid that serves as electron transporter in the bifunctional photosynthetic-respiratory transport chain of cyanobacteria. To examine the role of genes potentially involved in cyanobacterial plastoquinone biosynthesis, we have focused on three Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genes likely encoding a chorismate pyruvate-lyase (sll1797) and two 4-hydroxy-3-solanesylbenzoate decarboxylases (slr1099 and sll0936). The functions of the encoded proteins were investigated by complementation experiments with Escherichia coli mutants, by the in vitro enzyme assays with the recombinant proteins, and by the development of Synechocystis sp. single-gene knock-out mutants. Our results demonstrate that sll1797 encodes a chorismate pyruvate-lyase. In the respective knock-out mutant, plastoquinone was hardly detectable, and the mutant required 4-hydroxybenzoate for growth underlining the importance of chorismate pyruvate-lyase to initiate plastoquinone biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. The recombinant Slr1099 protein displayed decarboxylase activity and catalyzed in vitro the decarboxylation of 4-hydroxy-3-prenylbenzoate with different prenyl side chain lengths. In contrast to Slr1099, the recombinant Sll0936 protein did not show decarboxylase activity regardless of the conditions used. Inactivation of the sll0936 gene in Synechocystis sp., however, caused a drastic reduction in the plastoquinone content to levels very similar to those determined in the slr1099 knock-out mutant. This proves that not only slr1099 but also sll0936 is required for plastoquinone synthesis in the cyanobacterium. In summary, our data demonstrate that cyanobacteria produce plastoquinone exclusively via a pathway that is in the first reaction steps almost identical to ubiquinone biosynthesis in E. coli with conversion of chorismate to 4-hydroxybenzoate, which is then prenylated and decarboxylated."
https://openalex.org/W2142533206,"Plasma plasminogen is the precursor of the tumor angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin. Generation of angiostatin in blood involves activation of plasminogen to the serine protease plasmin and facilitated cleavage of two disulfide bonds and up to three peptide bonds in the kringle 5 domain of the protein. The mechanism of reduction of the two allosteric disulfides has been explored in this study. Using thiol-alkylating agents, mass spectrometry, and an assay for angiostatin formation, we show that the Cys(462)-Cys(541) disulfide bond is already cleaved in a fraction of plasma plasminogen and that this reduced plasminogen is the precursor for angiostatin formation. From the crystal structure of plasminogen, we propose that plasmin ligands such as phosphoglycerate kinase induce a conformational change in reduced kringle 5 that leads to attack by the Cys(541) thiolate anion on the Cys(536) sulfur atom of the Cys(512)-Cys(536) disulfide bond, resulting in reduction of the bond by thiol/disulfide exchange. Cleavage of the Cys(512)-Cys(536) allosteric disulfide allows further conformational change and exposure of the peptide backbone to proteolysis and angiostatin release. The Cys(462)-Cys(541) and Cys(512)-Cys(536) disulfides have -/+RHHook and -LHHook configurations, respectively, which are two of the 20 different measures of the geometry of a disulfide bond. Analysis of the structures of the known allosteric disulfide bonds identified six other bonds that have these configurations, and they share some functional similarities with the plasminogen disulfides. This suggests that the -/+RHHook and -LHHook disulfides, along with the -RHStaple bond, are potential allosteric configurations."

The dNTPase activity of EF1143 is regulated by canonical dNTPs, which simultaneously act as substrates and activity modulators. Previous crystal structures of apo-EF1143 and the protein bound to both dGTP and dATP suggested allosteric regulation of its enzymatic activity by dGTP binding at four identical allosteric sites. However, whether and how other canonical dNTPs regulate the enzyme activity was not defined. Here, we present the crystal structure of EF1143 in complex with dGTP and dTTP. The new structure reveals that the tetrameric EF1143 contains four additional secondary allosteric sites adjacent to the previously identified dGTP-binding primary regulatory sites. Structural and enzyme kinetic studies indicate that dGTP binding to the first allosteric site, with nanomolar affinity, is a prerequisite for substrate docking and hydrolysis. Then, the presence of a particular dNTP in the second site either enhances or inhibits the dNTPase activity of EF1143.

https://openalex.org/W2092938561,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are neurodegenerative diseases caused by prions in mammals. An aberrantly folded protein (PrP(Sc)) is the main component of these proteinaceous infectious particles. Prions exhibit strong resistance to protease digestion, which is typically exploited for biochemical discrimination from its native cellular form (PrP(C)). This classical feature has been partially challenged by the isolation of sizeable amounts of protease-sensitive PrP(Sc) isoforms that self-propagate in vivo. Here, we report that the degree of PrP(Sc) protease resistance is highly dependent on the concentration of salt in the solution. Similar changes were observed in PrP(Sc) obtained from different strains and species. Strikingly, the effect of salt is reversible and is associated with changes on the size of PrP(Sc) particles, but surprisingly, the more protease-sensitive species consists of a larger size. These findings shed light on the mechanistic aspects of prion proteolysis and should be considered when assessing samples of biomedical relevance."

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are arguably the most dangerous type of DNA damage as they can lead to chromosomal translocations when their repair joins noncontiguous genomic regions together. Indeed, numerous malignancies have been associated with signature translocations in which an oncogene becomes deregulated through joining with another gene that exerts control over its expression."
