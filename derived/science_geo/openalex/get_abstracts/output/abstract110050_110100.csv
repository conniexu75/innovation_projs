https://openalex.org/W2151142281,"The process by which viruses destabilize endosomal membranes in an acidification-dependent manner has been mimicked with synthetic peptides that are able to disrupt liposomes, erythrocytes, or endosomes of cultured cells. Peptides containing the 20 amino-terminal amino acid sequence of influenza virus hemagglutinin as well as acidic derivatives showed erythrocyte lysis activity only when peptides were elongated by an amphipathic helix or by carboxyl-terminal dimerization. Interestingly, peptides consisting of the 23 amino-terminal amino acids of influenza virus hemagglutinin were also active in erythrocyte lysis. When peptides were incorporated into DNA complexes that utilize a receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway for uptake into cultured cells, either by ionic interaction with positively charged polylysine-DNA complexes or by a streptavidin-biotin bridge, a strong correlation between pH-specific erythrocyte disruption activity and gene transfer was observed. A high-level expression of luciferase or interleukin-2 was obtained with optimized gene transfer complexes in human melanoma cells and several cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1591317354,"The mechanism of repression of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) promoter by 17 beta-estradiol (E2) was investigated in cells transfected with wild-type (wt) or mutant estrogen receptor (ER) expression vectors. In transient transfection experiments, IL-1-induced activation of the IL-6 promoter was efficiently inhibited by wt ER. However, estrogen receptors carrying mutations within or over-lapping with the DNA binding domain did not repress IL-6 promoter activity. A mutant receptor lacking the N-terminal transactivator function-1 but retaining the C-terminal transactivator function-2 also repressed activation of the IL-6 promoter. Our recent experiments indicate the requirement for both the nuclear factor (NF)-IL6 and the NF-kappa B sites in the IL-6 promoter for activation by IL-1. We now show that activation of the IL-6 promoter, elicited by a combination of NF-IL6 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B, can be inhibited by the wt receptor but not by a receptor containing a mutation in its DNA binding domain. Although a deletion within the DNA binding domain of ER abolished the repressor function of the receptor, a chimeric receptor ER-GR CAS1, in which the DNA binding domain of ER was swapped with the complementary region from the glucocorticoid receptor, retained the inhibitory effects on the IL-6 promoter. This was in contrast to the absolute dependence of ER on its own DNA binding domain for activation of typical estrogen response element-containing promoters, as reported previously by other investigators. Furthermore, the repression of the IL-6 promoter by a combination of ER and E2, unlike activation of estrogen response elements by the same combination, did not appear to be mediated via high affinity binding of the receptor to the promoter. In functional experiments, the transactivator function of ER was totally inhibited by overexpression of p65 and to a lesser extent by that of NF-IL6. These results indicate that ER may repress gene expression in the absence of high affinity DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1582232587,"HB-GAM (heparin binding growth-associated molecule; pleiotrophin) is a secretory, extracellular matrix-associated protein that is strongly expressed in developing nervous tissues and belongs to a novel family of differentiation/growth factors. It promotes axonal growth from perinatal rat brain neurons and is suggested to be mitogenic for some cell types and to display cell-transforming activity. Since the receptors of HB-GAM in cells are unknown, we have started isolation of putative cell surface receptors from brain neurons and from perinatal rat brain. For this purpose, recombinant HB-GAM was produced with the aid of a baculovirus vector and used as an affinity matrix in receptor isolation. A detergent-solubilized component from cultured brain neurons and from brain was identified that binds specifically to HB-GAM and migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad smear with an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kDa. This cell surface component was found to contain heparan sulfate chains, which are bound to a core protein with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa. Gel electrophoretic characteristics, immunochemical analysis, and partial peptide sequencing revealed that the cell surface component isolated as an HB-GAM receptor is N-syndecan (syndecan-3). In a solid phase binding assay, N-syndecan was found to bind to HB-GAM in a similar manner as to basic fibroblast growth factor (KD = 0.6 nM). Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that in brain neurons, N-syndecan occurs at the surface of the cell soma and of the neurites that grow along HB-GAM-coated substrates. Anti-N-syndecan antibodies added to culture media had an inhibitory effect on HB-GAM-induced neurite outgrowth. We suggest that N-syndecan mediates the neurite outgrowth-promoting signal from HB-GAM to the cytoskeleton of growing neurites."
https://openalex.org/W1607967639,"Tetanus toxin (TeTx) and the various forms of botulinal neurotoxins (BoNT/A to BoNT/G) potently inhibit neurotransmission by means of their L chains which selectively proteolyze synaptic proteins such as synaptobrevin (TeTx, BoNT/B, BoNT/F), SNAP-25 (BoNT/A), and syntaxin (BoNT/C1). Here we show that BoNT/D cleaves rat synaptobrevin 1 and 2 in toxified synaptosomes and in isolated vesicles. In contrast, synaptobrevin 1, as generated by in vitro translation, is only a poor substrate for BoNT/D, whereas this species is cleaved by BoNT/F with similar potency. Cleavage by BoNT/D occurs at the peptide bond Lys59-Leu60 which is adjacent to the BoNT/F cleavage site (Gln58-Lys59) and again differs from the site hydrolyzed by TeTx and BoNT/B (Gln76-Phe77). Cellubrevin, a recently discovered isoform expressed outside the nervous system, is efficiently cleaved by all three toxins examined. For further characterization of the substrate requirements of BoNT/D, we tested amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of synaptobrevin 2 as well as synthetic peptides. Shorter peptides containing up to 15 amino acids on either side of the cleavage site were not cleaved, and a peptide extending from Arg47 to Thr116 was a poor substrate for all three toxins tested. However, cleavability was restored when the peptide is further extended at the NH2 terminus (Thr27-Thr116) demonstrating that NH2 terminally located sequences of synaptobrevin which are distal from the respective cleavage sites are required for proteolysis. To further examine the isoform specificity, several mutants of rat synaptobrevin 2 were generated in which individual amino acids were replaced with those found in rat synaptobrevin 1. We show that a Met46 to Ile46 substitution drastically diminishes cleavability by BoNT/D and that the presence of Val76 instead of Gln76 dictates the reduced cleavability of synaptobrevin isoforms by TeTx."
https://openalex.org/W1590547533,"A key protein component of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel has been cloned from rat colon and human lung. It may represent the first member of a new family of ionic channels expressed from nematode to human. The biochemical properties of the rat protein, a 699 amino acids long polypeptide, have been analyzed. Four polyclonal antibodies raised against distinct parts of the channel immunoprecipitated a glycosylated protein of 96 kDa after cRNA expression in oocytes as well as after in vitro translation. When expressed alone into oocytes, the protein was not stable; most of it remains stacked into the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in a very low yield of complete maturation of the protein at the cell surface after expression from the pure cRNA. To determine the membrane topology of the protein, in vitro translation by a rabbit reticulocyte lysate was performed followed by insertion into canine pancreatic microsomes and protease digestion. Analysis revealed a model with only two transmembrane alpha helices and a large extracellular domain of about 500 amino acids. The NH2 and COOH termini are cytoplasmic. Protease digestion results suggest the possible presence of a structural element that could have a function similar to that of the H5 segment in K+ channels. The model indicates that there is no cytoplasmic site for protein kinase A phosphorylation. The well known regulation of the channel activity by hormones that activate this kinase such as vasopressin might thus be situated on another channel component."
https://openalex.org/W1582432277,"Three independent lines of evidence demonstrate an interaction between the head and tail domains of vinculin. First, both the purified 30-kDa tail fragment and a fusion protein containing tail domain, vinculin residues 884-1066, protect purified 95-kDa head domain from cleavage by protease V8 in a specific, dose-dependent manner. Second, direct binding studies between the 95-kDa head and the V884-1066 fusion protein and carboxyl-terminal truncations of the fusion protein indicate a tight interaction (Kd approximately 50 nM) that requires vinculin residues 1013-1043. Finally, cross-linking of vinculin demonstrates cross-linkable head-tail complexes in the intact protein, which are almost exclusively intramolecular. Talin and the tail domain compete for binding to the vinculin head domain. Therefore, we propose that the loss of the intramolecular interaction of head and tail accounts for the increased affinity for talin of the head domain compared with intact vinculin. The observation that a head-tail interaction in the molecule affects the ability of vinculin to interact with another adherens junction component suggests that modulation of head-tail binding is a way to control recruitment of vinculin into an adherens junction."
https://openalex.org/W1665723380,"The mechanism of divergent anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity of various 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogs (ddNs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) was studied. We demonstrate that the in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity of various ddNs varies profoundly and that the divergent antiviral activity is related to the extent of anabolic phosphorylation of each ddN and its counterpart 2'-deoxynucleoside (dN). We also show that certain ddNs cause a reduction of their counterpart dNTP formation in PBM in the following order: 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) >> 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (d4T), 3'-thia-2',3'-dideoxycytidine (3TC), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine (ddG) > 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) > 2'-beta-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (F-ara-ddA). Based on the phosphorylation profiles, anti-HIV-1 ddNs can be classified into two groups: (i) cell-activation-dependent ddNs such as AZT and d4T that are preferentially phosphorylated, yield higher ratios of ddNTP/dNTP, and exert more potent anti-HIV-1 activity in activated cells than in resting cells; and (ii) cell-activation-independent ddNs including ddI (and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine), F-ara-ddA, ddG, ddC, and 3TC that produce higher ratios of ddNTP/dNTP and exert more potent anti-HIV-1 activity in resting cells. These data should provide a basis for the elucidation of the mechanism of the divergent antiretroviral activity of ddNs."
https://openalex.org/W1674231565,"To gain a further understanding of the regulation of human type I collagen gene expression under physiologic and pathologic conditions, we characterized 5.3 kilobase pairs (kb) of the human alpha 1(I) procollagen gene promoter. A series of deletion constructs containing portions of the alpha 1(I) procollagen 5'-flanking region (with end points from -5.3 kb to -84 base pairs (bp)) ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene were transiently transfected into NIH/3T3 cells. Maximal CAT activity was observed with constructs having 5' end points from -804 to -174 bp. A further 5' deletion to -84 bp caused a marked reduction in CAT activity. Cells transfected with plasmids containing longer 5'-flanking fragments of the alpha 1(I) procollagen gene (-2.3 or -5.3 kb) showed reduced CAT activity compared with the -804 bp construct. The activity of the alpha 1(I) procollagen promoter was much lower in cells that do not normally express type I collagen (HeLa cells) compared with collagen-producing NIH/3T3 cells. The CAT activity of deletion constructs containing longer 5' regions than -84 bp was increased by approximately 2-fold in NIH/3T3 cells treated with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that protein-DNA complex formation with a probe corresponding to the -170 to -80 bp fragment of the alpha 1(I) procollagen promoter was markedly enhanced in nuclear extracts prepared from TGF beta 1-treated fibroblasts as compared with untreated fibroblasts. The DNA binding activity stimulated by TGF beta 1 was specific for an Sp1-like sequence at positions -164 to -142 bp in the promoter. These results demonstrate that 1) there are both positive and negative cis-acting regulatory elements in the human alpha 1(I) procollagen promoter, 2) these regulatory regions function differently in collagen-producing and -nonproducing cells, 3) the alpha 1(I) procollagen promoter contains TGF beta 1-responsive sequences located between -174 and -84 bp from the transcription start site, and 4) TGF beta 1 caused marked stimulation of the DNA binding activity of a nuclear factor interacting with an Sp1-like binding site located within a region encompassing -164 to -142 bp of the alpha 1(I) procollagen promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1545126968,"The c-MET proto-oncogene encodes the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor, a potent mitogen and motogen for epithelial cells. The level of the HGF receptor expressed by epithelial cells varies in different growth conditions, being lower in growth arrested confluent monolayers and higher in growing sparse cells. The amount of HGF receptor mRNA increases from 3- to 5-fold after stimulation of confluent monolayers by serum and up to 10-fold after stimulation of protein kinase C by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). An increased level of the receptor mRNA was also observed after cell stimulation with nanomolar concentration of HGF itself. The effect was transient, dose, and time-dependent. Transcription of a reporter gene under control of the cloned 297 base pair c-MET promoter was also stimulated by serum, TPA, or HGF. The accumulation of specific mRNA is followed by appearance of the HGF receptor precursor protein, which is further processed to the receptor mature form. After HGF stimulation, HGF receptor expression follows c-FOS and c-JUN induction with a peak approximately 4 h. Pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin strongly reduced the response to HGF, while cycloheximide alone increased the level of the receptor mRNA. These data show that c-MET behaves as a delayed early-response gene and suggest that the HGF response is autoamplified by inducing the specific receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1527487488,"The ATPase fragment of the bovine 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein is an attractive construct in which to study its mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. The three-dimensional structure suggests several residues that might participate in the ATPase reaction. Four acidic residues (Asp-10, Glu-175, Asp-199, and Asp-206) have been individually mutated to both the cognate amine (asparagine/glutamine) and to serine, and the effects of the mutations on the kinetics of the ATPase activity (Wilbanks, S. M., DeLuca-Flaherty, C., and McKay, D. B. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 12893-12898) and the structure of the mutant ATPase fragments have been determined, typically to approximately 2.4 A resolution. Additionally, the structures of the wild type protein complexed with MgADP and Pi, MgAMPPNP (5'-adenylyl-beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate) and CaAMPPNP have been refined to 2.1, 2.4, and 2.4 A, respectively. Combined, these structures provide models for the prehydrolysis, MgATP-bound state and the post-hydrolysis, MgADP-bound state of the ATPase fragment. These models suggest a pathway for the hydrolytic reaction in which 1) the gamma phosphate of bound ATP reorients to form a beta, gamma-bidentate phosphate complex with the Mg2+ ion, allowing 2) in-line nucleophilic attack on the gamma phosphate by a H2O molecule or OH- ion, with 3) subsequent release of inorganic phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1593612801,"A specific alanine racemase, which is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the undecapeptide cyclosporin A, was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the fungus Tolypocladium niveum. This is the first enzyme of this kind isolated from a eucaryotic organism. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible racemization of alanine and requires pyridoxal phosphate as the exclusive cofactor. Km values for L- and D-alanine were found to be 38 and 2 mM, respectively. Maximal reaction velocity was observed at 42 degrees C and pH 8.8 for the L to D direction. Molecular mass determinations of the denatured enzyme by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a value of 37 kDa, whereas gel filtration calibration studies yielded a value between 120 and 150 kDa, indicating an oligomeric native structure."
https://openalex.org/W1587854090,"Little is known about the regulation of EGF receptor (EGF-R) trafficking following endocytosis. We investigated this by using a series of EGF-R with altered cytoplasmic tails and comparing their ability to undergo recycling and lysosomal targeting in both the occupied and empty state. We found that 2-3% of empty EGF-R are internalized each minute, but rapidly recycle (t1/2 approximately 5 min). This constitutive internalization and recycling of empty receptors was independent of cytoplasmic receptor sequences. Occupied EGF-R, in contrast, displayed a much slower rate of recycling (t1/2 between 10-23 min) due to retention within recycling endosomes. Endosomal retention of different EGF-R correlated with lysosomal targeting of EGF. Intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity had no discernible effect on postendocytic trafficking of EGF. Although sequences within the cytoplasmic tail of the EGF-R appear to be required for occupancy-dependent endosomal retention, they are distinct from those required for ligand-induced endocytosis. Our studies indicate that intracellular trafficking of the EGF-R is regulated by endosomal components that preferentially recognize occupied receptors. Down-regulation of the EGF-R thus involves two distinct regulatory processes: one at the level of internalization and one at the level of recycling."
https://openalex.org/W1760498288,"A 160-kDa plasma membrane protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was overexpressed by mutating the PDR1 or the PDR3 transcription factor gene. The protein is the membrane-bound ATP binding cassette transporter PDR5 (Balzi, E., Wang, M., Leterme, S., Van Dyck, L., and Goffeau, A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 2206-2214). PDR5 was solubilized with n-dodecyl-beta-D-malto-side and separated from the PMA1 plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The PDR5 protein hydrolyzes nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates. This activity is sensitive to low concentrations of vanadate, of oligomycin, and of a variety of hydrophobic compounds. Many of these properties liken PDR5 to the purified mammalian P-glycoprotein responsible for multidrug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1614576580,"Somatostatin has a modulatory role in regulating the membrane conductance in hippocampal neurons. To examine the signal transducing molecules involved in this process, we isolated the cDNA encoding the dominant rat hippocampal somatostatin receptor, SSTR4. Distribution of SSTR4 in the adult central nervous system was restricted to the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and thalamus, as determined by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. In SSTR4-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, SSTR4 was functionally coupled not only to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, but also to activation of both arachidonate release and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, with similar ED50 values. All of these pathways, including both MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase activation, were completely blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. On the other hand, neither inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate synthesis nor intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was induced upon SSTR4 stimulation. These data indicate that the hippocampal functions of somatostatin might be mediated through diverse but selective second messenger systems activated via SSTR4 and reveal an unsuspected coupling of a neuronal SSTR subtype to a mitogenic signaling pathway. SSTR4, in addition, provides a useful system to study the Ca(2+)-independent, Gi-dependent (pertussis toxin-sensitive) pathway of MAP kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1548299326,"The 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein is a member of a highly conserved family of molecular chaperones in which the binding and release of target polypeptides are coupled to the chaperones' ATPase activity. The ATPase activity resides in the amino-terminal 44-kDa fragment of the protein. Four acidic residues of the ATPase fragment which might participate in catalysis (Asp-10 and Asp-199, which are Mg2+ ion ligands; Glu-175 and Asp-206, which are candidates for a role as catalytic base) have been individually mutated to both the cognate amide residue (aspartate to asparagine, glutamate to glutamine) and to serine, and the effects of the mutations on the kinetics (this manuscript) and structure (Flaherty, K.M., Wilbanks, S. M., DeLuca-Flaherty, C., and McKay, D. B. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 12899-12907) have been determined. Changes at Asp-10 and Asp-199 reduced kcat to approximately 1% of wild type; changes at Glu-175 and Asp-206 reduced kcat to approximately 10% of wild type. Changes to Asp-199 and Asp-206 had little effect on Km; changes to Asp-10 and Glu-175 increased Km 10-100-fold. These data suggest that the bound magnesium ion and its local environment are crucial to catalysis; they argue against a single residue acting as the sole essential general base catalyst in the hydrolytic reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1576768388,"Asparagine-linked glycosylation of proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is catalyzed by the oligosaccharyltransferase. Previously, the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase was shown to co-purify with a protein complex consisting of three integral membrane proteins: ribophorin I and ribophorin II and a nonglycosylated 48-kDa polypeptide designated OST48. Here, we describe the purification of the oligosaccharyltransferase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast oligosaccharyltransferase complex is composed of six subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta). The alpha subunit of the yeast oligosaccharyltransferase complex is a heterogeneously glycosylated protein with three glycoforms of 64, 62, and 60 kDa that contain, respectively, four, three, and two asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains. The beta and delta subunits were shown to correspond to the 45-kDa Wbp1 glycoprotein and the 30-kDa Swp1 protein, respectively. The Wbp1 and Swp1 proteins were previously shown to be essential for asparagine-linked glycosylation in vivo. The nonglycosylated gamma, epsilon, and zeta subunits have apparent molecular masses of 34, 16, and 9 kDa. Homology between the yeast and mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase complexes first became evident when the 48-kDa subunit of the mammalian enzyme was found to be 25% identical in sequence with the Wbp1 protein. Here we present an alignment between the Swp1 protein and the carboxyl-terminal half of human ribophorin II that reveals that these two proteins are related gene products."
https://openalex.org/W1492552461,"Insect cell expression systems are used to characterize signaling components such as G protein-coupled receptors. As such, one must know whether endogenous G proteins couple to non-native receptors. We examined G protein linkages after infection of Sporodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with a baculovirus encoding the 5-HT1A receptor. Receptor expression was confirmed by immunoblot. Some of the receptors were functional, showing guanine nucleotide-sensitive binding to the specific agonist ligand [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetranaphthalene). Peak expression (approximately 150 fmol/mg of membrane protein) was attained approximately 72-96 h post-infection. 5-HT-increased covalent binding of [32P]GTP-azidoanilide to a 40 kDa band, which was identified as a G protein by nucleotide blocking, Mg2+ dependence, and immunoblot and immunoprecipitation studies. The band comigrated with 1) pertussis toxin substrate(s), and 2) a band recognized by two G(o) alpha antisera and one common to heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunits, but not by sera specific for Gs alpha or G(i) alpha. Labeled species could be precipitated with a G(o) alpha antiserum. 5-HT-increased labeling of the band was prevented by preincubation with pertussis toxin. These studies suggest that the 5-HT1A receptor couples effectively to native insect cell G(o)-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1572419994,"Abstract We have cloned and sequenced QCR10, the nuclear gene encoding an 8.5-kDa protein proposed to be a subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. QCR10 includes a 231-base pair open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 77 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 8492 Da. The codons for the amino-terminal methionine and alanine are separated from the remainder of the open reading frame by a 63-base pair intron that contains 5'-donor, 3'-acceptor, and TACTAAC sequences known to be necessary for splicing. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 8.5-kDa yeast protein is 28% identical to that of the 6.4-kDa subunit 11 from the bovine heart cytochrome bc1 complex, and the predicted secondary structures of the two proteins are very similar. Deletion of the chromosomal copy of QCR10 did not affect the growth of yeast on nonfermentable carbon sources. However, deletion of QCR10 synergistically contributes to the temperature-dependent phenotype resulting from deletion of QCR6, the gene for subunit 6 of the cytochrome bc1 complex. In addition, ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity was reduced 40% in mitochondrial membranes from the QCR10 deletion strain, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein was lost when the cytochrome bc1 complex lacking the 8.5-kDa protein was purified. We conclude that the 8.5-kDa protein encoded by QCR10 is a subunit of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex and that the presence of this subunit during assembly is required for stable association of the iron-sulfur protein with the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1522067055,"Abstract While most humans express an alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase in plasma, 9% of individuals on the isle of Java (Indonesia) do not express this enzyme. Ninety-five percent of these plasma alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase-deficient individuals have Lewis negative phenotype on red cells, suggesting strong linkage disequilibrium between these two traits. To define the molecular basis for this plasma deficiency and to determine which of two candidate human alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase genes encode this enzyme (FUT5 and FUT6), we cloned and analyzed alleles at these two loci from an Indonesian individual deficient in plasma alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase activity. Single base pair changes were identified in the coding region of each gene, relative to previously published wild type alleles. These changes in turn yield three codon changes in FUT5 and three in FUT6. The codon changes in the FUT5 gene do not yield detectable diminutions in alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase activity when tested by expression in transfected COS-1 cells, and none of the FUT5 alleles co-segregate with plasma alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase deficiency in Indonesian pedigrees. By contrast, two of the codon changes in the FUT6 alleles inactivate this gene when tested by expression in transfected COS-1 cells. One of these inactivating changes is a missense mutation (Glu-247-->Lys) within the enzyme's catalytic domain. The other inactivating mutation represents a nonsense mutation (Tyr-315-->stop) that truncates the COOH terminus of the enzyme by 45 amino acids. The Glu-247-->Lys missense mutation is present in double dose in the nine plasma alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase-deficient individuals tested, whereas the nonsense mutation at tyrosine 315 is present in double dose in just one of these persons. These results demonstrate that the alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase activity in human plasma is encoded by the FUT6 gene and that the missense mutation within codon 247 of this gene is responsible for deficiency of this activity in these Indonesian families."
https://openalex.org/W1505432515,"Abstract The intracellular site for the degradation of free polymannose oligosaccharides released during glycoprotein biosynthesis has been studied by permeabilizing the plasma membrane of metabolically radiolabeled HepG2 cells with streptolysin O. This pore-forming agent permitted us to examine the breakdown in both the cytosolic and vesicular compartments of the previously recognized (Anumula, K. R., and Spiro, R. G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 15274-15282) polymannose components terminating in a di-N-acetylchitobiose sequence (OS-Glc-NAc2) or a single N-acetylglucosamine residue (OS-Glc-NAc1) residue. Pulse-chase studies indicated that although the OS-GlcNAc2 saccharides were about equally distributed between vesicles and cytosol and rapidly disappeared after reaching the Man8 stage, the OS-GlcNAc1 species were found predominantly in the extravesicular compartment and there underwent a distinctive demannosylation sequence resulting in the formation of a Man5GlcNAc isomer (Man alpha 1-->2Man alpha 1-->2Man alpha 1-->3(Man alpha 1-->6)Man beta 1-->4GlcNAc) which was different from the product of Golgi processing enzymes. Further trimming of this cytosolic limit product required its translocation into a vesicular compartment, believed to be lysosomes, in which Man2-4GlcNAc components appeared as the metabolic chase progressed. The accumulation of Glc1Man5GlcNAc in the cytosol during the chase suggested that glucose interferes with the cytosolic-vesicular transfer and this became even more evident by the pronounced pile-up of extravesicular Glc3Man5GlcNAc when the cells were incubated in the presence of castanospermine. Although the biological significance and mechanism of free polymannose oligosaccharide entry into the cytosol is not yet known, the possibility that it may reflect an endoplasmic reticulum-situated degradative process of glycoproteins merits consideration."
https://openalex.org/W1540963075,"Insulin treatment of untransfected 3T3 L1 cells quickly induced activation of a cytosolic 42-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and a 90-kDa S6 kinase (RSK). The activation of these cytosolic kinases was also mimicked by Ras expression (in the absence of insulin) in the same cells transfected with inducible ras oncogenes. Furthermore, insulin-induced activation of MAPK and RSK could be blocked by expression of a transfected inducible dominant negative Ras mutant (Asn-17). These results indicate that Ras proteins are obligatory intermediates in the activation of the cytosolic MAPK/RSK cascade by insulin. Insulin treatment of 3T3 L1 cells or expression of transfected ras oncogenes resulted also in hyperphosphorylation of cellular Raf-1. Insulin-induced Raf hyperphosphorylation was inhibited by expression of an inducible dominant negative Ras mutant (Asn-17). We also showed that expression of transfected raf oncogenes induces adipocytic differentiation, as detected by expression of the specific adipocytic marker aP2. In addition, insulin-induced differentiation was significantly blocked by expression of a dominant negative raf mutant. Interestingly, however, the expression of transfected raf oncogenes did not induce MAPK or RSK activation, and the insulin-induced activation of these kinases was not blocked by expression of transfected dominant negative raf mutants. These results are consistent with Raf kinases acting downstream of Ras, but not upstream of MAPK and RSK in insulin-signaling pathways leading to 3T3 L1 differentiation."

While prostromelysin failed to bind TIMP, active stromelysin bound to the inhibitor avidly, exhibiting an affinity for TIMP (Ki = 8.3 x 10(-10) M) essentially identical to that of active interstitial collagenase as determined by competition experiments. C-terminal truncated stromelysin also formed a higher M(r) complex with TIMP which survived gel filtration. However, when truncated stromelysin was forced to compete with its full-length parent molecule for limiting amounts of TIMP, the full-length enzyme preferentially bound to the inhibitor. Indeed, binding studies indicated a Ki of 5.95 x 10(-9) M for the truncated variant's interaction with TIMP, only 14% as tight as that of full-length stromelysin. We also examined the interaction between TIMP and matrilysin, the only metalloproteinase which naturally lacks a C-terminal domain. Promatrilysin failed to bind the inhibitor. However, active matrilysin readily bound TIMP, forming a complex that resisted separation by gel filtration. When active matrilysin was forced to compete with truncated stromelysin for limiting amounts of TIMP, both enzymes appeared to complex the inhibitor with nearly equivalent efficacy. Indeed, active matrilysin exhibited a Ki for TIMP of 4.5 x 10(-9) M, essentially identical to that of truncated stromelysin. These data indicate that, as is true for collagenase, the C-terminal domain of stromelysin contributes significantly to its capacity to bind the physiologic inhibitor, TIMP. Furthermore, since stromelysin readily processes in vitro to a C-terminal truncated form, this enzyme species, as well as the full-length metalloproteinase matrilysin, may resist inhibition by TIMP in areas of active inflammation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1483473649,"The mechanism(s) by which low density lipoprotein (LDL) attenuates the release of endothelial-derived nitric oxide (EDNO) is not known but may involve inhibition of membrane signal transduction. To test this hypothesis, we treated bovine aortic endothelial cells with LDL (0-500 micrograms/ml, 72 h) to determine its effect on G proteins (G(i) and Gq) which are known to couple the bradykinin receptor to EDNO release. Bradykinin-stimulated EDNO release was measured by perfusion bioassay and showed a maximal 56% decrease which was unaffected by cotreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX, 100 ng/ml, 16 h). Although radioligand binding studies and Western blotting did not detect any significant changes in the amount of bradykinin receptor, alpha i2, alpha i3, and alpha q, both agonist-stimulated GTPase activity and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis were reduced by LDL treatment (77 and 70%, respectively). When G(i) and Gq function in LDL-treated membranes were assessed by PTX and COOH-terminal antisera to alpha i2 (P4), alpha i3 (JL14), and alpha q (Q17), only the Q17 antisera caused a further reduction in GTPase activity and PIP2 hydrolysis while treatment with PTX alone or in combination with the P4 and JL14 antisera had no further inhibitory effect. These results suggest that LDL attenuates EDNO release by preferentially inhibiting the function of Gi."

(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3813-3816). Using antibodies raised against beta-chimaerin, we detected a major 46-kDa RacGAP in the rat cerebellum. With beta-chimaerin cDNA as a probe and using polymerase chain reaction, cDNAs from both human and rat cerebellum were isolated. The human and rat cDNAs encoded sequences containing cysteine-rich and GAP domains identical to those of testis beta-chimaerin. The cDNAs also encoded an additional N-terminal SH2 (Src homology 2) domain, probably derived from the beta-chimaerin gene by alternate splicing. This SH2 domain of the predicted 54-kDa protein was strikingly similar to that of alpha 2-chimaerin, including replacement by glutamic acid of the invariant tryptophan present at the start of other SH2 domains. The SH2 domains of alpha- and beta-chimaerin thus represent a subset of SH2 domains. The cerebellar beta-chimaerin (beta 2-) is expressed mainly in granule cells and exhibits postnatal developmental increases. beta 2-Chimaerin was enriched in particulate/synaptosomal fractions. In the mouse weaver mutant lacking mature granule cells, there is a corresponding decrease in beta 2-chimaerin, which could well serve as a marker of granule cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1606105951,"Glucose transport and phosphorylation are the first steps in the utilization of extracellular glucose by skeletal muscle. We have examined the relationships between proteins mediating these steps in single fibers of identified type dissected from rabbit skeletal muscle. The level of the glucose transporter isoform GLUT4, measured by immunoblotting, varied among fibers by a factor of 20 (slow oxidative > fast oxidative glycolytic > fast glycolytic). In fibers from the tibialis anterior muscle, GLUT4 was correlated (r2 = 0.75) with the activity of malate dehydrogenase, an enzyme representative of oxidative energy metabolism. In these fibers a strong correlation (r2 = 0.70) was also observed between GLUT4 and hexokinase activity. GLUT1 levels were barely detectable, regardless of fiber type. To investigate the possible role of muscle activity in controlling the expression of transporters, tibialis anterior muscles were activated by chronic electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerves. GLUT1 levels increased after 1 day of stimulation to a plateau that was severalfold higher than the level in non-stimulated cells. Hexokinase activity and the GLUT4 level changed in parallel: both were increased by approximately 2.5-fold after 1 day and by 14-fold after 21 days. Thus, while both GLUT1 and GLUT4 were regulated by muscle activity, only GLUT4 expression was coordinated with the expression of hexokinase."

We have identified a novel insulin-stimulated MEK kinase (I-MEKK) in the 100,000 x g infranatant that shows rapid phasic kinetics that temporally precede that of MEK. Maximal activation of I-MEKK occurs within 20 +/- 5 s (S.D., n = 3) followed by complete inactivation by 30 +/- 10 s (S.D., n = 3). I-MEKK was characterized by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography and separated into two distinct activities of approximately 56 kDa that phosphorylated and activated MEK. I-MEKKs did not co-elute on anion exchange with c-Raf or 73-kDa MEK kinase (MEKK), suggesting they are distinct enzymes. Protein phosphatase 2A inactivated both I-MEKKs in vitro and in the intact cell okadaic acid blocked inactivation in the presence of insulin. These results suggest activation of I-MEKK involves phosphorylation on serine or threonine residues. I-MEKK was not activated by PMA, suggesting that in adipocytes the enzyme represents a divergence point between signal transduction pathways mediated by insulin and those activating protein kinase C."

(1991) J. Virol. 65, 5149-5156). Inhibitor studies indicated that the HSV-1 protease is sensitive to the serine protease inactivator diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). Inactivation is irreversible and dependent on time and concentration of DFP. Loss of activity correlates linearly with the incorporation of [3H]DFP. Analysis of completely inactivated protease by mass spectrometry indicated a stoichiometry of 1 DFP/protease. In order to identify the specific residue modified by DFP, the protease was labeled with [3H]DFP and subsequently digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin. The peptides resulting from each digestion were separated by reverse phase HPLC, and the radioactivity was recovered in a single peak. Mass spectrometric studies and sequencing analysis by Edman degradation identified Ser-129 as the residue modified by DFP. This residue and the region in which it is found is highly conserved among the herpes viral proteases. These data demonstrate that HSV-1 protease is a serine protease and that Ser-129 is the active site nucleophile."

A cold-sensitive dnaAcos mutant caused excessive initiation at a restrictive temperature without an increase in the level of DnaA protein. The chromosomal origin (oriC) was essential for the lethality caused by the dnaAcos product. Increased initiation activity was neutralized by multiple copies of oriC on a plasmid (pBR322). OriC plasmids were replicated efficiently in vitro in a crude extract prepared from a dnaAcos mutant, with a specific activity for the DnaAcos protein 8-fold greater than that for the DnaA+ protein in a wild-type extract. OriC-dependent replication in the dnaAcos extract was inhibited by rifampicin and by gyrase inhibitors as was replication in the dnaA+ extract. As a control, replication of single-stranded phage phi X174 DNA, which did not require DnaA protein, was similar in extracts prepared from dnaA+ and dnaAcos cells. Thus, initiation at oriC by DnaAcos protein appears to be highly activated both in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W61636863,"The specific roles of the finger (F) and kringle 2 (K2) domains of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were quantified with regard to fibrin binding and kinetic parameters for plasminogen activation by employing domain-deletion variants. On an intact fibrin clot, active site-blocked 125I-t-PA has a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.36 +/- 0.08 microM and a single binding site per fibrin monomer (n = 1.1 +/- 0.1). Deletion of the K2 domain results in a 3-fold increase of the Kd (1.1 +/- 0.2 microM) and a 2-fold increase of the binding sites per fibrin monomer (n = 2.0 +/- 0.3). Deletion of the F domain results in nonsaturable binding with high Kd (3.2 +/- 0.6 microM). These results indicate that the high affinity binding of t-PA to intact fibrin is the resultant of the cooperation of two low affinity binding sites assembled on intact t-PA. Furthermore, fibrin clot lysis experiments were performed, using polymerized fibrin and plasminogen. Enzymatic activity of t-PA (variants) was assessed by following the decrease in turbidity of the polymerized fibrin. Intact recombinant t-PA exhibited a Michaelis constant for plasminogen activation (Km) of 37 +/- 2 nM. Deletion of either the K2 or F domain results in an increase of the Km for plasminogen of 4- and 16-fold, respectively. We interpret these kinetic parameters in terms of the ternary complex model: binding of t-PA to fibrin, mediated simultaneously by both the F and K2 domain, is essential for a correct orientation of the enzyme on the fibrin polymer to yield the optimal Km-driven stimulation of fibrin on the activation of plasminogen. The different potencies of various deletion mutants in a plasma clot are explained by decreased affinity of the enzymes both for fibrin and for the substrate plasminogen."

PreLamB synthesized in this manner is translocated into salt-extracted plasma membrane vesicles only in the presence of SecA/SecB- or SecB-containing preparations of the E. coli cytosol. The most active preparations obtained upon purification were those containing a soluble SecA/SecB complex. Complex formation between SecA and SecB was verified by co-sedimentation and co-immunoprecipitation. When preLamB was synthesized in the presence of this material, a considerable amount of precursor was recovered from a soluble ternary complex consisting of preLamB, SecA, and SecB.

https://openalex.org/W1555876563,"The metalloendopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 is believed to degrade gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2) by cleavage at the Tyr5-Gly6 bond. We compared the ability of crude and partially purified endopeptidase 24.15 from ovine hypothalamus with recombinant rat testicular endopeptidase 24.15 to degrade synthetic GnRH. Both soluble and membrane hypothalamic fractions degraded GnRH to GnRH1-5, with some production of GnRH1-9 and GnRH1-3. Generation of the smaller fragments was blocked by a specific endopeptidase 24.15 inhibitor (CFP-AAY-pAB), but production of GnRH1-9 was reciprocally enhanced, suggesting this peptide may be an intermediate generated by prolyl endopeptidase. Indeed, both bacitracin and Z-Pro-prolinal, inhibitors of this enzyme, markedly reduced GnRH degradation to any product. Degradation of synthetic GnRH1-9 was more rapid than that of GnRH and was inhibited by CFP-AAY-pAB but not bacitracin. Activity against either substrate was greater in the soluble fraction. Repeated washing of the membrane fraction followed by extraction with Triton X-114 suggested that both endopeptidase 24.15 and prolyl endopeptidase, although predominantly soluble, can be peripherally associated with membranes. When fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, soluble endopeptidase 24.15 degraded GnRH only in fractions that also exhibited prolyl endopeptidase activity. In contrast, maximal degradation of GnRH1-9 was observed in adjacent fractions, which also contained the highest levels of immunoreactive endopeptidase 24.15. The affinity of recombinant endopeptidase 24.15 for GnRH was low (Km = 1.35 mM), was improved 10-15-fold by removal of the COOH-terminal amide or glycinamide (Km = 90 and 119 microM, respectively), and could be inhibited by CFP-AAY-pAB but not bacitracin. Taken together, these results suggest that GnRH metabolism in the hypothalamus may occur via a two-step process involving first removal of Gly10-NH2 by prolyl endopeptidase, followed by cleavage by endopeptidase 24.15 at the Tyr5-Gly6 bond."
https://openalex.org/W1507386943,"The precise location of the regulatory F-actin- and calmodulin-binding sites in the COOH-terminal sequence Trp659-Pro756 of gizzard caldesmon was investigated by subjecting the corresponding 10-kDa CNBr fragment, characterized earlier (Bartegi, A., Fattoum, A., Derancourt, J., and Kassab, R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15231-15238), to limited chymotryptic reactions conducted in the absence and presence of F-actin-tropomyosin. As a result, the F-actin-binding and actomyosin ATPase inhibitory activity was separated from the regulatory Ca(2+)-calmodulin-binding site. Seven chymotryptic peptides accounting for the entire primary structure of the CB10 fragment were isolated, and their complete amino acid sequences were established by combining NH2-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry, and gel electrophoresis. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography analyses of the binding of F-actin to these peptides revealed the 30-residue sequence Leu693-Trp722 as the unique crucial stretch for actin interaction and ATPase inhibition. This segment was also specifically protected by F-actin against proteolytic degradation. We further determined the functional properties of three synthetic peptides which successively cover the sequences Asn675-Lys695, Leu693-Trp722, and Arg711-Lys729. The first peptide segment specifically bound Ca(2+)-calmodulin as assessed by affinity chromatography and spectrofluorometry and should contain a potent novel calmodulin-binding subsite. The second immediately adjacent peptide inhibited the actomyosin ATPase in a tropomyosin-sensitive manner, as expected. In contrast, the third peptide displayed no detectable function. The results indicate that the overall sequence Asn675-Trp722 represents the essential regulatory unit of the COOH-terminal 10-kDa domain of caldesmon."

Using probes derived from this region, we cloned the entire genomic region spanning the first MET exon and the flanking regulatory sequences. The first exon, containing the entire untranslated sequence, is present in the MET mRNAs of 7.1, 5.9, and 4.6 kilobases, showing that the expression of the multiple transcripts is regulated by a single promoter. The start site of transcription was determined by primer extension and by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. We show that a 300-base pair fragment, containing sequences upstream from the start site, efficiently drives the expression of a reporter gene in transfected epithelial cells. This promoter fragment also contains the cis-acting elements responsible for phorbol-ester induction."

The anti-gamma 3 antibodies were used for immunopurification of GABAA receptors containing gamma 3-subunits. Western blot analysis of the immunopurified GABAA receptors indicated that the gamma 3-subunit exhibits an apparent molecular mass of 43-46 kDa. Furthermore, in addition to gamma 3-subunits, beta 2/3-, alpha 1-, alpha 2-, alpha 3-, alpha 4-, and alpha 6-subunits could be detected in immunoaffinity column eluates from total brain and cerebellum, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1584553848,"The chicken alpha-cardiac actin is one of the earliest contractile protein genes selectively expressed during embryonic skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation. Cardiac actin promoter elements were examined in these two sarcomeric cell types. A portion of the alpha-cardiac actin promoter responsible for striated muscle specificity has been delineated (1, 2) and shown to contain four serum response elements (SRE). Previously, SRE3 was shown to be part of a complex element in conjunction with a functional E box (2), and we now show that SRE4 is also part of an upstream SRE.E box cis-element complex. The SREs function similarly, but the E boxes have dissimilar properties within and between striated muscle types. The SRE3.E1 box binds myogenic basic helix-loop-helix factors and is required for cardiac actin trans-activation in primary muscle cell cultures but functions as a negative regulatory element in cardiac muscle cells. The SRE4.E2 box, on the other hand, fails to bind basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors, is negative acting in skeletal muscle cells, and is positive acting in cardiac myocytes. A DNA binding factor similar to HF1a (3) was identified that interacts specifically with the SRE4.E2 box.

Phosphorylation of the 20-kDa light chain by myosin light chain kinase is part of the regulation of smooth muscle and mammalian nonmuscle myosin II. We designed, characterized, and tested the use of a protein-based optical biosensor to monitor this phosphorylation switch. A regulatory light chain was genetically engineered to contain a single cysteine at amino acid position 18. The mutant light chain (Cys18.LC20), reacted with the fluorophore acrylodan, responded to phosphorylation of serine 19 with a fluorescence emission quenching of 60% and a 28-nm red-shift. When the acrylodan-labeled mutant light chain (AC-Cys18.LC20) was exchanged into turkey gizzard myosin II, it exhibited a 25% fluorescence emission quenching and a 10-nm red-shift upon phosphorylation of serine 19. The myosin II optical biosensor exhibited nearly control levels of the rate of phosphorylation, K+ATPase activity, and in vitro motility. The acrylodan-labeled light chain was exchanged into the A-bands of chicken pectoralis myofibrils in situ to demonstrate the localization and activity of the biosensor in a highly ordered contractile system. Fluorometry and quantitative fluorescence microscopic imaging experiments demonstrated that AC-Cys18.LC20 exchanged myofibrils expressed a phosphorylation-dependent fluorescence change. Labeled light chains were also incorporated into stress fibers of living fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. This general approach of combining molecular biology and fluorescence spectroscopy to create novel protein-based optical biosensors should provide valuable tools for investigations with model systems and solution studies and ultimately yield important information about temporal-spatial chemical and molecular changes in live cells."

Previously, we purified a beta-pol promoter ATF/CRE-binding protein (named palindrome-binding protein or PBP) from bovine testes and found that this protein is a beta-pol promoter transcriptional activator in vitro using a HeLa nuclear extract transcription system (Widen, S. G., and Wilson, S. H. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6296-6305). In this study, we determined the mechanism of in vitro transcriptional activation by this purified PBP. We used a PBP-depleted HeLa nuclear extract transcription system with an artificial promoter containing a solitary activator element corresponding to the entire 22-nucleotide beta-pol promoter ATF/CRE-binding site. Kinetic analyses of the 180-nucleotide run-off product formation indicated that stimulation of transcriptional activity by PBP was due entirely to an increase in the rate constant for promoter clearance. Thus, under our conditions, the purified PBP had no effect on the rate of closed preinitiation complex formation or for the closed complex to open complex transition. Instead, the rate of productive initiation leading to the 180-nucleotide transcript was stimulated by PBP. We found that the rate of closed preinitiation complex formation was not in rapid equilibrium with promoter and RNA polymerase II, in contrast to the model with prokaryotic RNA polymerase transcription. The results also indicated that PBP binding to the ATF/CRE is required for the stimulation of promoter clearance. These studies define the kinetic mechanism of a purified ATF/CRE-binding protein in stimulation of the in vitro transcription of a designed mammalian promoter."

In rat hepatic cells, the transcription rate of the Hx gene is increased by interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6. To investigate the cis-acting regulatory elements (REs) responsive to these hormones, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs of rat and human Hx gene sequences were tested in transiently transfected hepatoma cells. An IL-6-RE was identified in the promoter of both rat and human Hx genes, the function of which was dependent on the core sequence (CCGGGAA) common in other APP genes. The previously characterized Hx A element mediated a relatively minor cytokine response as compared with the Hx IL-6-RE. The human Hx A element, in contrast to the rat and human Hx IL-6-REs, was strongly trans-activated by cotransfected CAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP)-beta and -delta. The rat gene homolog of the human Hx A element was inactive as a cytokine RE and was minimally trans-activated by C/EBP isoforms. Results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the Hx IL-6-RE is a binding site for the IL-6-inducible nuclear protein IL-6 RE-BP, which also binds to the conserved IL-6-REs of other APP genes and is distinct from C/EBP beta."

The respective recombinant proteins were purified and used to produce specific anti-subunit antibodies. Immunoblotting of two-dimensional gels of purified rat liver multicatalytic proteinase showed that the C2 (32-kDa) and C9 (29-kDa) polypeptides are resolved into three and two isoelectric variants, respectively, likely due to post-translational modifications, i.e. phosphorylation, and the presence of two anti-C5 reacting polypeptides (25.5 and 23 kDa). Epitope mapping of the anti-C2-specific antibody with different constructs of the recombinant C2 protein allowed us to determine that one major epitope of this anti-C2 antibody is located within the last 9-11 amino acids of the C2 polypeptide. Affinity purified antibodies directed against the C2 COOH-terminal were able to discriminate the active and latent forms of the multicatalytic proteinase, supporting the conclusion that the C2 protein found in the active form of the enzyme is a polypeptide of 28 kDa, produced by the loss, at least, of the last 9-13 amino acids (DEPAEKADEPMEH) of the intact C2 (32-kDa) component. By in vitro treatment of the latent form of the enzyme with elastase, we show the conversion of the C2 (32-kDa) component to a 28-kDa protein with loss of recognition by the anti-C2 COOH-terminal affinity purified antibodies, but this limited degradation of the C2 component did not have any significant effect on the proteolytic activity (assayed with myelin basic protein and fluorogenic peptides) of the multicatalytic proteinase. It is suggested that the proteolytic cleavage of the C2 COOH-terminal region may be involved in the regulation of the interaction of the multicatalytic proteinase with other cellular proteins and/or in the translocation of the complex to the nucleus."

Currently, it is not known whether TR/TRAP or TR/RXR heterodimers need to bind to both TRE half-sites and whether there is a preferred orientation for TR/RXR heterodimer binding to TREs or transcriptional activation. Accordingly, we created a mutant TR alpha (TR-P box) by changing 3 amino acids in the P box region of the first zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain to that of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and we examined wild-type TR alpha and TR-P box complex binding to hybrid response elements containing TRE and glucocorticoid receptor element (GRE) half-sites arranged as a direct repeat with a four-nucleotide gap. TR-P box/RXR heterodimers selectively bound to the hybrid response elements in which GRE half-site was the downstream half-site, whereas TR alpha/RXR bound to hybrid response elements in which GREs were in either position. Additionally, TR/TRAP or TR/RXR heterodimer required two half-sites for binding to DNA, with strong binding to at least one of the half-sites. Last, co-transfection assays and methylation interference studies using the hybrid response elements suggest that the sequential arrangement of strong and weak half-sites in the TRE may be a critical determinant of TR/RXR heterodimer binding and transcriptional activation."

We have studied the structure and enzymatic activity of ribonuclease A treated with trichloroacetic acid over a wide range of acid concentrations (0-40%). The far ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of ribonuclease A, on exposure to acid concentrations less than 10%, indicated an exceptionally high degree of chiral structure. Exposure of ribonuclease A to acid concentrations between 10 and 30% resulted in the formation of a molecule with significant chiral structure (conventionally assigned to residual secondary structure) but reduced tertiary structure (characteristics very similar to those of molten globule). Increased binding of the hydrophobic probe 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate to the enzyme treated with 15-30% acid, as compared with the untreated or completely unfolded protein, supported the existence of a state having characteristics of molten globule. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography corroborated the data obtained by circular dichroism as well as 1-anilino-naphthalene-8-sulfonate-binding studies. Beyond acid concentrations of 30%, the ribonuclease is completely denatured. The trichloroacetic acid-induced unfolding is shown to be completely reversible."

For large scale preparation of the cytosolic domain, the modified P450Cm1 was first purified and then subjected to sequence-specific proteolysis. The highly purified delta(1-66)P450Cm1 exhibited unchanged spectral characteristics and catalyzed the hydroxylation of n-hexadecane with 85% of the activity determined for full-length wild-type P450Cm1.

The specific binding of [3H]LTC4 was of low affinity (KD = 26 nM) and high abundance (Bmax = 33 pmol/mg of protein), as compared to LTD4 and LTB4 receptors. In addition, although [3H]LTC4 specific binding was enhanced by divalent cations, it was not inhibited by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs. [3H]LTC4 specific binding to dU937 cell membranes does not have, therefore, the characteristics of binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor. Competition for [3H]LTC4 specific binding to dU937 cell membranes by leukotrienes and related analogs, including N-methylated LTC4, as well as glutathione, suggested a dependence on the presence of an arachidonic acid backbone, although varying degrees of saturation were well tolerated, and that the glutathione moiety of LTC4 in particular was important in determining affinity. The possibility that [3H]LTC4 specific binding was to a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family of enzymes, such as LTC4 synthase, cytosolic GST, or microsomal GST, was therefore investigated. [3H]LTC4 specific binding sites could be separated from LTC4 synthase and cytosolic GSTs by differential detergent solubilization, but cofractionated with microsomal GST during solubilization and subsequent anion exchange chromatography. In membranes that were depleted of LTC4 synthase and cytosolic GSTs, 125I-azido-LTC4 (a photoaffinity probe based on LTC4) specifically photolabeled in a cation-dependent manner a 17-kDa polypeptide that was comparable in mass to the microsomal GST polypeptide. Furthermore, [3H]LTC4 bound specifically to purified human microsomal GST with the same characteristics as to the endogenous dU937-cell membrane specific binding sites. The principal [3H]LTC4 specific binding site present in dU937 cells, therefore, is not a G-protein-coupled receptor, LTC4 synthase, or cytosolic GSTs, but is microsomal GST. Finally, the 1:3 stoichiometry of [3H]LTC4 specific binding to purified microsomal GST is consistent with the enzyme functioning as a homotrimer."
https://openalex.org/W1606384407,"Abstract Mutations of the invariant Int family tetrad residues, the RHR triad, and the active tyrosine, within the Zygosaccharomyces rouxii site-specific recombinase R cause the same phenotypes as they do in the Flp recombinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In half-site recombinations, the R recombinase exhibits catalytic complementation between an RHR triad mutant and an active tyrosine mutant. Strand cutting by R follows the trans DNA cleavage rule. These results are best explained by the assembly of a functional active from partial active sites harbored by the ARg monomers. Complementation tests using single and double step-arrest ARg mutants verify critical predictions of the shared active site model. A wild type monomer paired with an RHR triad-Tyr358 double mutant is a catalytically inactive combination. Pairwise combinations of a single or a double RHR mutant with R(Y358F) yield comparable levels of catalytic complementation. These results strongly imply conservation of the mechanism of active assembly and the mode of substrate cleavage within the yeast family site-specific recombinases, and perhaps within the larger Int family recombinases [corrected]."
https://openalex.org/W1493732561,"Using Uvr proteins we have quantified benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE)-DNA adduct formation and repair at the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) genes in two Chinese hamster ovary cell lines: B-11 cells, which are 50-fold amplified for DHFR, and AT3-2 cells, which are diploid for DHFR. We have found that: 1) BPDE-DNA adduct formation in different regions of the DHFR gene is proportional to the concentration of BPDE. 2) There is no significant difference in the repair of BPDE-DNA adducts between the coding and noncoding regions in either amplified or nonamplified DHFR gene domains. 3) Repair in the nonamplified DHFR gene is more efficient (30-40%) than in the amplified DHFR genes. 4) There are no significant differences of repair in the transcribed or nontranscribed strands of the DHFR gene. 5) BPDE-DNA adduct formation and repair in the APRT gene in B-11 and AT3-2 cells are the same. These results contrast those for the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, which occurs preferentially in the transcribed strand of the DHFR gene and in which gene amplification appears to play no role."
https://openalex.org/W1575253927,"Lactoferrin is present in a variety of tissues and biological fluids; however, the amount differs significantly due to differential expressions. We have previously demonstrated that the mouse lactoferrin gene is regulated by estrogen through an estrogen-response DNA element located at -349, upstream from the transcription start site (+1). In this report, we characterized by deletion and mutation analyses a cluster of mitogen-response elements located between -80 and -40 of the mouse lactoferrin promoter. We demonstrated that the chimeric chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs (the -103 to +1 sequence of the mouse lactoferrin gene) containing the mitogen-response unit of the lactoferrin gene were stimulated by cAMP, forskolin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and epidermal growth factor/recombinant transforming growth factor-alpha (EGF/TGF-alpha) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The sequence at position -52 to -40 (mLF-CRE) of the gene conferred transcriptional activation in the presence of forskolin, cyclic AMP, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in transiently transfected human endometrium carcinoma RL95-2 cells, whereas the region at -80 to -60 responded to EGF/TGF-alpha stimulation. Overexpression of the catalytic unit of protein kinase C or protein kinase A in the RL95-2 cells elevated the chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase activity of the reporter construct 5-6-fold. The mobility shift assay suggested that AP1 and CREB or related proteins participated in complex formation with the mLF-CRE, whereas different proteins bound to the EGF/TGF-alpha-response element."
https://openalex.org/W1536997676,"We compare translocation into inside-out plasma membrane vesicles (INV) of the in vitro synthesized outer membrane proteins LamB and OmpA and the periplasmic protein Skp of Escherichia coli and demonstrate a precursor-specific dependence on the export factors SecA, SecB, and the proton-motive force (delta mu H+). A partial reduction in soluble SecA caused a 50% decrease in translocation of preLamB. In contrast, removal of INV-bound SecA by urea extraction was required to see a decrease in translocation of preOmpA and preSkp, with 8% of preSkp still being translocated into urea-treated INV. Translocation of the three precursors into INV showed a corresponding differential sensitivity toward dissipation of delta mu H+ following removal of the F1-ATPase from the INV. While depletion of both F1 and SecA or simply lowering of the reaction temperature resulted in an inhibition of complete transmembrane translocation, it interfered less severely with signal sequence cleavage, indicating the formation of translocation intermediates under these conditions. The relative amounts of intermediate obtained were also different for the three preproteins correlating a low requirement for SecA and delta mu H+ with a facilitated initiation of translocation. Whereas preSkp was translocated independently of SecB, preLamB was not even targeted to the INV in its absence. Functional targeting of preOmpA required the presence of SecB during incubation of the precursor with INV and not during its synthesis. SecB, exogenously added during the period of synthesis, did not prevent the formation of translocation-incompetent preLamB. The latter results are consistent with an important targeting function of SecB, which so far has mostly been described as a molecular chaperone. The findings are discussed with respect to current models of bacterial protein export usually derived from the analysis of a single precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1505586805,"The B element of the elastase I transcriptional enhancer is active in both exocrine and endocrine cells of the pancreas. Cell transfection experiments revealed that in an acinar cell line the active sequence of the element is more extensive than in an endocrine cell line. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified three major complexes (designated C, M, and L) from acinar cell nuclear extracts bound to the element. The C complex appears to be responsible for the activity of the element in acinar cells because its binding site, determined by methylation interference and mobility shift competition experiments, matches the critical sequence identified by cell transfection analysis of mutated B elements. The DNA sequence requirements for formation of the C complex is the sum of those for the M and L complexes. Methylation interference experiments indicated that the sensitivity of the C complex to guanine methylation also was the sum of that of the M and L complexes. Diagonal electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that L is a component of complex C. However, the M complex, which we identified as GATA-4, is not part of the C complex, because the C complex was neither competed by GATA-binding sites nor super-shifted by anti-GATA-4 antiserum. Both the C and L complexes are specific to the pancreatic acinar cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1550861285,"A novel, highly truncated form of a cDNA encoding Artemia phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC), designated PLC-beta x, was isolated from a brine shrimp cDNA library. The full-length cDNA is of the beta-type, it is 2855 base pairs long, and it contains an open reading frame encoding 489 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of PLC-beta c cDNA shows novel features. It lacks several hundred amino acids at the 5' end, as compared to PLC-beta s in the higher species. It contains conserved domains X and Y, but domain X is highly truncated at the 5' end (only 14-25 conserved amino acids as compared to about 150 amino acids in the higher eukaryotic organisms). Northern blot hybridization showed that the PLC-beta x cDNA corresponds to a 4.4-kilobase mRNA. Northern blot hybridization with a cDNA probe from the 5' end and PCR performed upstream from domain Y showed that PLC-beta x is not a cloning artifact due to fusion of an unrelated clone into the coding region of the PLC-beta homologue. A functional PLC and new protein bands on SDS-PAGE were observed after subcloning full-length PLC-beta x cDNA, as well as a fragment containing the conserved regions, into expression plasmid vectors and transfecting into Escherichia coli. 1 mM lithium markedly stimulated expression in E. coli."
