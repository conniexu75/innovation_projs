https://openalex.org/W2148226925,"The quantum Hall effect (QHE), one example of a quantum phenomenon that occur on a truly macroscopic scale, has been attracting intense interest since its discovery in 1980 and has helped elucidate many important aspects of quantum physics. It has also led to the establishment of a new metrological standard, the resistance quantum. Disappointingly, however, the QHE could only have been observed at liquid-helium temperatures. Here, we show that in graphene - a single atomic layer of carbon - the QHE can reliably be measured even at room temperature, which is not only surprising and inspirational but also promises QHE resistance standards becoming available to a broader community, outside a few national institutions."
https://openalex.org/W2037009864,"Long viewed as a topic in classical physics, ferroelectricity can be described by a quantum mechanical ab initio theory. Thin-film nanoscale device structures integrated onto Si chips have made inroads into the semiconductor industry. Recent prototype applications include ultrafast switching, cheap room-temperature magnetic-field detectors, piezoelectric nanotubes for microfluidic systems, electrocaloric coolers for computers, phased-array radar, and three-dimensional trenched capacitors for dynamic random access memories. Terabit-per-square-inch ferroelectric arrays of lead zirconate titanate have been reported on Pt nanowire interconnects and nanorings with 5-nanometer diameters. Finally, electron emission from ferroelectrics yields cheap, high-power microwave devices and miniature x-ray and neutron sources."
https://openalex.org/W1980576528,"Theoretical models have long pointed to the dentate gyrus as a possible source of neuronal pattern separation. In agreement with predictions from these models, we show that minimal changes in the shape of the environment in which rats are exploring can substantially alter correlated activity patterns among place-modulated granule cells in the dentate gyrus. When the environments are made more different, new cell populations are recruited in CA3 but not in the dentate gyrus. These results imply a dual mechanism for pattern separation in which signals from the entorhinal cortex can be decorrelated both by changes in coincidence patterns in the dentate gyrus and by recruitment of nonoverlapping cell assemblies in CA3."
https://openalex.org/W2086557360,"Granitic plutonism is the principal agent of crustal differentiation, but linking granite emplacement to crust formation requires knowledge of the magmatic evolution, which is notoriously difficult to reconstruct from bulk rock compositions. We unlocked the plutonic archive through hafnium (Hf) and oxygen (O) isotope analysis of zoned zircon crystals from the classic hornblende-bearing (I-type) granites of eastern Australia. This granite type forms by the reworking of sedimentary materials by mantle-like magmas instead of by remelting ancient metamorphosed igneous rocks as widely believed. I-type magmatism thus drives the coupled growth and differentiation of continental crust."
https://openalex.org/W2013885170,"By trapping molecules between two gold electrodes with a temperature difference across them, the junction Seebeck coefficients of 1,4-benzenedithiol (BDT), 4,4′-dibenzenedithiol, and 4,4′′-tribenzenedithiol in contact with gold were measured at room temperature to be +8.7 ± 2.1 microvolts per kelvin (μV/K), +12.9 ± 2.2 μV/K, and +14.2 ± 3.2 μV/K, respectively (where the error is the full width half maximum of the statistical distributions). The positive sign unambiguously indicates p-type (hole) conduction in these heterojunctions, whereas the Au Fermi level position for Au-BDT-Au junctions was identified to be 1.2 eV above the highest occupied molecular orbital level of BDT. The ability to study thermoelectricity in molecular junctions provides the opportunity to address these fundamental unanswered questions about their electronic structure and to begin exploring molecular thermoelectric energy conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2109120242,"The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is the main pathway by which newly born subventricular zone cells reach the olfactory bulb (OB) in rodents. However, the RMS in the adult human brain has been elusive. We demonstrate the presence of a human RMS, which is unexpectedly organized around a lateral ventricular extension reaching the OB, and illustrate the neuroblasts in it. The RMS ensheathing the lateral olfactory ventricular extension, as seen by magnetic resonance imaging, cell-specific markers, and electron microscopy, contains progenitor cells with migratory characteristics and cells that incorporate 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine and become mature neurons in the OB."
https://openalex.org/W2079657320,"The adult Drosophila midgut contains multipotent intestinal stem cells (ISCs) scattered along its basement membrane that have been shown by lineage analysis to generate both enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells. ISCs containing high levels of cytoplasmic Delta-rich vesicles activate the canonical Notch pathway and down-regulate Delta within their daughters, a process that programs these daughters to become enterocytes. ISCs that express little vesiculate Delta, or are genetically impaired in Notch signaling, specify their daughters to become enteroendocrine cells. Thus, ISCs control daughter cell fate by modulating Notch signaling over time. Our studies suggest that ISCs actively coordinate cell production with local tissue requirements by this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2017329746,"Elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem alter patterns of aggregation, habitat selection, vigilance, and foraging in the presence of wolves (Canis lupus). Antipredator behaviors like these can reduce predation risk but are also likely to carry costs. Data from five elk populations studied for 16 site years showed that progesterone concentrations (from 1489 fecal samples) declined with the ratio of elk to wolves. In turn, progesterone concentrations were a good predictor of calf recruitment in the subsequent year. Together, these data suggest that wolves indirectly affect the reproductive physiology and the demography of elk through the costs of antipredator behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2022666050,"The quantum ""mystery which cannot go away"" (in Feynman's words) of wave-particle duality is illustrated in a striking way by Wheeler's delayed-choice GedankenExperiment. In this experiment, the configuration of a two-path interferometer is chosen after a single-photon pulse has entered it : either the interferometer is \textit{closed} (\textit{i.e.} the two paths are recombined) and the interference is observed, or the interferometer remains \textit{open} and the path followed by the photon is measured. We report an almost ideal realization of that GedankenExperiment, where the light pulses are true single photons, allowing unambiguous which-way measurements, and the interferometer, which has two spatially separated paths, produces high visibility interference. The choice between measuring either the 'open' or 'closed' configuration is made by a quantum random number generator, and is space-like separated -- in the relativistic sense -- from the entering of the photon into the interferometer. Measurements in the closed configuration show interference with a visibility of 94%, while measurements in the open configuration allow us to determine the followed path with an error probability lower than 1%."
https://openalex.org/W2002675380,"Satellite laser altimeter elevation profiles from 2003 to 2006 collected over the lower parts of Whillans and Mercer ice streams, West Antarctica, reveal 14 regions of temporally varying elevation, which we interpret as the surface expression of subglacial water movement. Vertical motion and spatial extent of two of the largest regions are confirmed by satellite image differencing. A major, previously unknown subglacial lake near the grounding line of Whillans Ice Stream is observed to drain 2.0 cubic kilometers of water into the ocean over ∼3 years, while elsewhere a similar volume of water is being stored subglacially. These observations reveal a wide spread, dynamic subglacial water system that may exert an important control on ice flow and mass balance."
https://openalex.org/W2033098156,"Pathogenic bacteria use the type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins into host cells to modulate the host signaling pathways. In this study, the Shigella type III effector OspF was shown to inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38]. OspF irreversibly removed phosphate groups from the phosphothreonine but not from the phosphotyrosine residue in the activation loop of MAPKs. Mass spectrometry revealed a mass loss of 98 daltons in p-Erk2, due to the abstraction of the α proton concomitant with cleavage of the C-OP bond in the phosphothreonine residue. This unexpected enzymatic activity, termed phosphothreonine lyase, appeared specific for MAPKs and was shared by other OspF family members."
https://openalex.org/W2030333049,"The incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia is greatly increased following cerebral ischemia and stroke in which hypoxic conditions occur in affected brain areas. β-Amyloid peptide (Aβ), which is derived from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages from β-secretase (BACE1) and presenilin-1 (PS1)/γ-secretase, is widely believed to trigger a cascade of pathological events culminating in AD and vascular dementia. However, a direct molecular link between hypoxic insults and APP processing has yet to be established. Here, we demonstrate that acute hypoxia increases the expression and the enzymatic activity of BACE1 by up-regulating the level of BACE1 mRNA, resulting in increases in the APP C-terminal fragment-β (βCTF) and Aβ. Hypoxia has no effect on the level of PS1, APP, and tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE, an enzyme known to cleave APP at the α-secretase cleavage site). Sequence analysis, mutagenesis, and gel shift studies revealed binding of HIF-1 to the <i>BACE1</i> promoter. Overexpression of HIF-1α increases BACE1 mRNA and protein level, whereas down-regulation of HIF-1α reduced the level of BACE1. Hypoxic treatment fails to further potentiate the stimulatory effect of HIF-1α overexpression on BACE1 expression, suggesting that hypoxic induction of BACE1 expression is primarily mediated by HIF-1α. Finally, we observed significant reduction in BACE1 protein levels in the hippocampus and the cortex of HIF-1α conditional knock-out mice. Our results demonstrate an important role for hypoxia/HIF-1α in modulating the amyloidogenic processing of APP and provide a molecular mechanism for increased incidence of AD following cerebral ischemic and stroke injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2021354435,"For many insects, the polarization pattern of the blue sky serves as a compass cue for spatial navigation. E -vector orientations are detected by photoreceptors in a dorsal rim area of the eye. Polarized-light signals from both eyes are finally integrated in the central complex, a brain area consisting of two subunits, the protocerebral bridge and the central body. Here we show that a topographic representation of zenithal E -vector orientations underlies the columnar organization of the protocerebral bridge in a locust. The maplike arrangement is highly suited to signal head orientation under the open sky."
https://openalex.org/W2087043303,"Extending the productive lifespan of human cells could have major implications for diseases of aging, such as atherosclerosis. We identified a relationship between aging of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt/PBEF/Visfatin), the rate-limiting enzyme for NAD+ salvage from nicotinamide. Replicative senescence of SMCs was preceded by a marked decline in the expression and activity of Nampt. Furthermore, reducing Nampt activity with the antagonist FK866 induced premature senescence in SMCs, assessed by serial quantification of the proportion of cells with senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. In contrast, introducing the Nampt gene into aging human SMCs delayed senescence and substantially lengthened cell lifespan, together with enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. Nampt-mediated SMC lifespan extension was associated with increased activity of the NAD+-dependent longevity enzyme SIRT1 and was abrogated in Nampt-overexpressing cells transduced with a dominant-negative form of SIRT1 (H363Y). Nampt overexpression also reduced the fraction of p53 that was acetylated on lysine 382, a target of SIRT1, suppressed an age-related increase in p53 expression, and increased the rate of p53 degradation. Moreover, add-back of p53 with recombinant adenovirus blocked the anti-aging effects of Nampt. These data indicate that Nampt is a longevity protein that can add stress-resistant life to human SMCs by optimizing SIRT1-mediated p53 degradation.

Age is the greatest risk factor for myocardial infarctions and strokes (1Lakatta E.G. Levy D. Circulation. 2003; 107: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). This risk is partly attributable to an age-related decline in the ability of vascular cells to resist stress and effectively remodel the arterial wall. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) 3The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; Nampt, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; TSA, trichostatin A; FBS, fetal bovine serum; SA β-Gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 3The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; Nampt, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; TSA, trichostatin A; FBS, fetal bovine serum; SA β-Gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; ANOVA, analysis of variance. are especially important in this regard; the efficiency with which SMCs stabilize a developing atherosclerotic lesion determines whether the lesion will rupture, a potentially fatal event. Strategies to prevent the premature senescence of SMCs could be a promising approach for reducing vascular disease if molecular targets can be identified. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt, also known as Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor and Visfatin (2Fukuhara A. Matsuda M. Nishizawa M. Segawa K. Tanaka M. Kishimoto K. Matsuki Y. Murakami M. Ichisaka T. Murakami H. Watanabe E. Takagi T. Akiyoshi M. Ohtsubo T. Kihara S. Yamashita S. Makishima M. Funahashi T. Yamanaka S. Hiramatsu R. Matsuzawa Y. Shimomura I. Science. 2005; 307: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar)) is the rate-limiting enzyme for NAD+ biosynthesis from nicotinamide. The intracellular levels of NAD+ and nicotinamide have recently been identified as important for certain cell survival reactions, including those linked to the sirtuin family of protein deacetylases (3Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 4Araki T. Sasaki Y. Milbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Sirtuins, such as Sir2 and its mammalian homolog SIRT1, consume NAD+ and generate nicotinamide as they hydrolytically remove a targeted acetyl group (3Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Nicotinamide is a known inhibitor of NAD+-dependent deacetylation reactions. Therefore, pathways that both replenish NAD+ and clear nicotinamide could be vital to SIRT1 activity. Recently, we discovered that Nampt was substantially up-regulated when a uniquely long-lived human vascular SMC line was subjected to the stress of complete serum withdrawal (5van der Veer E. Nong Z. O'Neil C. Urquhart B. Freeman D. Pickering J.G. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Here, we report that Nampt is a longevity protein that extends the lifespan of human SMCs by activating SIRT1 and restraining the accumulation of p53. Cell Culture—Experiments were performed using primary human vascular SMCs derived by outgrowth from fragments of internal thoracic artery and the HITC6 SMC clonal line, also originally generated from the human internal thoracic artery (6Li S. Fan Y.S. Chow L.H. Van Den Diepstraten C. van Der Veer E. Sims S.M. Pickering J.G. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Dermal fibroblasts from an individual with Hutchison-Gilford progeria syndrome were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository. To quantify replication, cells were plated at 4,500 cells/cm2, and growth medium with 10% FBS was changed every 2 days until cells reached 90–95% confluence. Harvested cells were counted from triplicate plates, and the number of population doublings was calculated based on: log10 [(number of cells harvested) – log10 (number of cells seeded)]/log10 (2Fukuhara A. Matsuda M. Nishizawa M. Segawa K. Tanaka M. Kishimoto K. Matsuki Y. Murakami M. Ichisaka T. Murakami H. Watanabe E. Takagi T. Akiyoshi M. Ohtsubo T. Kihara S. Yamashita S. Makishima M. Funahashi T. Yamanaka S. Hiramatsu R. Matsuzawa Y. Shimomura I. Science. 2005; 307: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). Population growth curves were compared using nonlinear regression. Recombinant Retrovirus and Adenovirus Infection—A retroviral gene delivery system was used to generate human cells stably overexpressing Nampt, using methods described previously (7Rocnik E.F. Van Der Veer E. Cao H. Hegele R.A. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38571-38578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Retrovirus containing pQCXIP-Nampt-IRES-PURO or pQCXIP-IRES-PURO (Clontech Laboratories) was generated by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of the Phoenix-amphotropic retrovirus packaging cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Stable transductants were selected with puromycin (3 μg/ml). Dominant-negative SIRT1 (H363Y) was similarly transduced using the pBABE retroviral expression vector. Recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying human p53 or enhanced green fluorescent protein expression cassettes were constructed, purified, and titered as described previously (8Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J. Gendron T.F. Callaghan S.M. Park D.S. Parks R.J. Graham F.L. Morley P. Slack R.S. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque-forming units/cell. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis with chemiluminescence detection, as described (7Rocnik E.F. Van Der Veer E. Cao H. Hegele R.A. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38571-38578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nampt was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-human Nampt/Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). SIRT1 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Sirt1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and p53 and α-tubulin were detected with monoclonal antibodies (DO-1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA and Clone B-5-1-1 from Sigma, respectively). Cytoplasmic p53 was similarly assessed following cell fractionation (NucBuster, Novagen, Minneapolis, MN). Identification of p53 that underwent NAD+-dependent removal of an acetyl group on residue Lys-382 was determined by pretreating SMCs for 2 h with 5 μm trichostatin A (TSA), immunoprecipitating p53 with a goat polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and immunoblotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-acetylated p53 (Lys-382) antibody (American Proteomics, Carlsbad, CA) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Nampt Activity—Whole cell lysates were reacted with 5 μm [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide (Sigma) and 0.5 mm phosphoribosylpyrophosphate in 10 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 8.8 (9Rongvaux A. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Gigot D. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Labeled acetone-precipitable nicotinamide mononucleotide was quantified by scintillation counting. Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Activity Assay—SMCs at ∼70% confluence were fixed in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min and incubated with X-gal-containing reaction mixture, as described (10Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). Cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 (2.5 μg/ml), and the proportion of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA β-Gal)-positive cells was quantified (Olympus BX51, ×20 objective, ∼1200 cells). Senescence-free survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival versus replicative age. In Vivo Assessment of SIRT1 DeacetylaseActivity—Cell-basedassessment of SIRT1 enzymatic activity was performed using the Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 substrate (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), as described (11de Boer V.C. de Goffau M.C. Arts I.C. Hollman P.C. Keijer J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2006; 127: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). SMCs in phenol red-free M199 with 5% FBS were incubated for 2 h with 5 μm TSA followed by the addition of the fluorogenic substrate for 4 h. Signal was quantified by spectrofluorometry (Wallac, Wellesley, MA) and normalized to total protein content. Time-lapse Analysis of SMC Response to Oxidative Stress—The morphologic response to oxidative stress was dynamically assessed by digital time-lapse microscopy, using methods previously described (12Fera E. O'Neil C. Lee W. Li S. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35573-35582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hoffman-modulated contrast images (Axiovert S100; Carl Zeiss, Inc. Thornwood, NY) were digitally acquired every 5 min over 3 h, beginning immediately after the addition of 150 μm H2O2 to SMCs in M199 containing 1% FBS. Nampt Expression and Activity Decline as Human SMCs Undergo Replicative Aging—To track Nampt expression as SMCs undergo replicative aging, two human SMC preparations with different in vitro lifespans were studied: 1) primary cultures of SMCs, initiated by outgrowth from the internal thoracic artery harvested from adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery; and 2) a clonal line of human SMCs (HITC6) that also originated from the internal thoracic artery but displayed enhanced longevity in culture (6Li S. Fan Y.S. Chow L.H. Van Den Diepstraten C. van Der Veer E. Sims S.M. Pickering J.G. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SMCs were serially subcultured until they reached senescence, indicated by cessation of proliferation, an enlarged flattened morphology, and cytoplasmic β-galactosidase activity at pH 6.0 (Fig. 1, A and B). In both SMC preparations, Nampt protein expression declined significantly as SMCs approached senescence (Fig. 1, C and D). Nampt enzyme activity, assessed by quantifying the conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide (5van der Veer E. Nong Z. O'Neil C. Urquhart B. Freeman D. Pickering J.G. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), fell in presenescent SMCs even more strikingly than Nampt expression, reaching 14 ± 3% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) of basal activity (Fig. 1C). These findings identify the regeneration of NAD+ from nicotinamide as a metabolic pathway that becomes exhausted as SMCs approach senescence. Nampt Regulates and Extends Human Cellular Lifespan—To determine whether human SMC lifespan could be extended by overriding this innate decline in Nampt expression and activity, we augmented Nampt gene dosage by introducing human Nampt cDNA into SMCs using retrovirus. This yielded a 7.1 ± 3.1-fold increase in Nampt activity in stably transduced SMCs. Primary adult SMCs overexpressing Nampt surpassed the maximal lifespan of vector-infected SMCs by an additional 2.1 ± 0.3 population doublings, which, given their otherwise short in vitro lifespan, constituted a 34 ± 4% prolongation of lifespan (Fig. 2A). Equally notably, this extension proceeded in cells that were already well advanced along their path to replicative senescence. In the longer lived HITC6 SMCs, lifespan extension by Nampt was even more striking, with an additional 6.3 ± 0.3 population doublings or a 71 ± 7% extension of lifespan (Fig. 2A). Cell lifespan extension by Nampt was not limited to SMCs and was also seen with human fibroblasts derived from a subject with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a condition associated with markedly premature atherosclerosis (13Al-Shali K.Z. Hegele R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1591-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To determine the role of endogenous Nampt in SMC lifespan and senescence, SMCs were incubated with the specific Nampt antagonist FK866 (14Hasmann M. Schemainda I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7436-7442PubMed Google Scholar). FK866 is a long, almost linear molecule that binds Nampt from within a narrow tunnel at the Nampt dimer interface, an unusual structural relationship that accounts for its specificity (15Khan J.A. Tao X. Tong L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We quantified the proportion of senescent SMCs in successive subcultures incubated with 10 nm FK866, a concentration we determined reduced Nampt activity in SMCs to 22 ± 2% of baseline. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a substantially shortened senescence-free survival of Nampt-inhibited cells SMCs (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, there was markedly extended senescence-free survival in Nampt-overexpressing SMCs versus vector-infected cells (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2C). Therefore, a direct relationship exists between Nampt activity and the number of replication cycles a SMC can undergo before becoming senescent. Together with the age-related decline in Nampt activity, these data firmly establish Nampt as a longevity enzyme for human SMCs. Nampt Postpones Senescence by Activating SIRT1—To explore the mechanism by which Nampt regulates SMC lifespan, we considered that Nampt both stimulates NAD+ production and consumes nicotinamide, positioning this enzyme as a potential regulator of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase, SIRT1 (16Revollo J.R. Grimm A.A. Imai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50754-50763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). SIRT1 consumes NAD+, is inhibited by nicotinamide, and mediates lifespan extension of caloric restricted animals (17Cohen H.Y. Lavu S. Bitterman K.J. Hekking B. Imahiyerobo T.A. Miller C. Frye R. Ploegh H. Kessler B.M. Sinclair D.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 627-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To test whether Nampt could stimulate SIRT1 activity in human SMCs, TSA-independent deacetylation of a fluorogenic SIRT1 substrate (Biomol) was quantified. As shown in Fig. 3A, SMCs overexpressing Nampt had a 86 ± 4% (p = 0.03, n = 4) increase in SIRT1 activity. We were surprised to find that Nampt overexpression also modestly increased abundance of SIRT1 protein (1.3 ± 0.3-fold, p = 0.02), although not enough to fully account for the increased deacetylase activity (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the lifespan extending actions of Nampt were mediated by the increased SIRT1 expression and activity, human SMCs were double-transduced to express Nampt and a dominant-negative form of SIRT1 (H363Y) (18Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Ng Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar). This revealed that the extended lifespan conferred by Nampt was abrogated when the SIRT1 H363Y allele was co-expressed (5.4 ± 0.5 versus 0.3 ± 0.3 of additional population doublings, p = 0.003). Furthermore, the reduction in senescent SMCs in late passage (37th subculture) Nampt-overexpressing SMCs (19 ± 2%, p = 0.003) was no longer observed when dominant-negative SIRT1 was coexpressed (p = 0.3), with a relative increase in senescence that was greater than for vector-infected SMCs expressing SIRT1 H363Y (55 ± 12 versus 15 ± 10%, p = 0.01, Fig. 3C). Nampt Enhances p53 Degradation and Exogenous p53 Abrogates Nampt-mediated Inhibition of Senescence—p53 is stabilized by acetylation of Lys-382, and this p53 site is a known target of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation (19Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9391-9398Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). p53 promotes aging (20Bauer J.H. Helfand S.L. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and in keeping with this, we found that p53 abundance increased as human SMCs approached replicative senescence (Fig. 3D). However, this age-related increase in p53 was blunted in parallel cultures of SMCs overexpressing Nampt. Furthermore, the fraction of p53 that was acetylated on Lys-382 was substantially lower in Nampt-overexpressing SMCs than in control cells (Fig. 3E). This p53 modification was associated with a significantly increased rate of p53 degradation in Nampt-overexpressing SMCs, as assessed in SMCs incubated with cycloheximide (Fig. 3F). To determine whether altered p53 levels underlay the changes in senescence induced by Nampt, p53 was introduced to SMCs using recombinant adenovirus (9Rongvaux A. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Gigot D. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3G, add-back of p53 to Nampt-overexpressing SMCs abrogated the reduction in senescent SMCs afforded by augmented Nampt activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that Nampt postpones cellular senescence by ensuring ongoing and efficient degradation of p53. Nampt Protects against Oxidative Cell Damage—Finally, using time-lapse microscopy (12Fera E. O'Neil C. Lee W. Li S. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35573-35582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we established that the additional replicative life conferred by Nampt was associated with a healthy, stress-resistant phenotype. Although vector-infected SMCs responded to 150 μm H2O2 by global retraction of plasma membrane, Nampt-overexpressing SMCs, matched for cumulative population doubling, largely maintained their morphology and ability to migrate (Fig. 4A and supplemental video file). Concurrently, H2O2 induced a rapid increase in cytoplasmic p53 in control SMCs, whereas the response was blunted in Nampt-overexpressing SMCs (Fig. 4B). Our study establishes that a programmed diminution in the capacity to regenerate NAD+ from nicotinamide is a critical precursor of human SMC senescence. Moreover, by enhancing Nampt activity, cellular lifespan can be lengthened, a phenomenon that we observed in human primary SMCs, human clonal SMCs, and fibroblasts derived from a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. We further established that this anti-aging phenomenon is mediated by enhanced SIRT1 deacetylase activity that, in turn, holds p53 levels below those which induce senescence. These findings implicate a Nampt-SIRT1-p53 axis as a fundamental determinant of human cell aging. The role of Nampt as a driver of cellular stress resistance and longevity is noteworthy in the context of its expression profile. Nampt is up-regulated by stressful stimuli including infection and proinflammatory cytokines (21Jia S.H. Li Y. Parodo J. Kapus A. Fan L. Rotstein O.D. Marshall J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In human SMCs, Nampt expression increased substantially in response to the stress of complete serum removal (5van der Veer E. Nong Z. O'Neil C. Urquhart B. Freeman D. Pickering J.G. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This latter response is reminiscent of the up-regulation of PNC1 in yeast subjected to caloric restriction (22Yang H. Lavu S. Sinclair D.A. Exp. Gerontol. 2006; 41: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PNC1 encodes a nicotinamide deamidase, and the resulting clearance of nicotinamide is considered to be a protective action that, in yeast, translates the stress of caloric restriction into Sir2-mediated extended longevity (23Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The ability of Nampt to enhance resistance to stress and extend cellular longevity in a SIRT1-dependent manner suggests that Nampt may orchestrate an analogous longevity paradigm in human cells. Our data also suggest, however, that such a protective/longevity response to mild stress would itself be dependent on cellular age. That is, the endogenous decline in Nampt activity that we observed in presenescent cells might underlie a switch in the response to low level stress from lifespan extension to accelerated aging. Cell senescence is strongly implicated in age-related pathologies as well as the recognized decline in tissue regenerative potential with age (24Rando T.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Vascular SMC senescence, a hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions (25Matthews C. Gorenne I. Scott S. Figg N. Kirkpatrick P. Ritchie A. Goddard M. Bennett M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), can be particularly dangerous because the resulting proinflammatory and nonreparative state can incite lesion disruption and acute vascular occlusion. The current findings identify Nampt as underlying an aging suppression pathway in SMCs, with potential relevance to controlling atherosclerosis and possibly other diseases of aging."

We found that actin fibers polymerizing along the leading edge directed local protrusions and drove synchronous sideways movement of beta1 integrin adhesion receptors. These movements lead to the clustering and positioning of conformationally activated, but unligated, beta1 integrins along the leading edge of fibroblast lamellae and growth cone filopodia. Thus, rapid actin-based movement of primed integrins along the leading edge suggests a ""sticky fingers"" mechanism to probe for new adhesion sites and to direct migration."

https://openalex.org/W2077609848,"In this study, mechanisms of resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis in human K562 cells were examined. Continuous exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of imatinib resulted in the selection of K562/IMA-0.2 and -1 cells, which expressed ∼2.3- and 19-fold resistance, respectively. Measurement of endogenous ceramides by high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy showed that treatment with imatinib increased the generation of ceramide, mainly C18-ceramide, which is generated by the human longevity assurance gene 1 (hLASS1), in sensitive, but not in resistant cells. Inhibition of hLASS1 by small interfering RNA partially prevented imatinib-induced cell death in sensitive cells. In reciprocal experiments, overexpression of hLASS1, and not hLASS6, in drug-resistant cells caused a marked increase in imatinib-induced C18-ceramide generation, and enhanced apoptosis. Interestingly, there were no defects in the levels of mRNA and enzyme activity levels of hLASS1 for ceramide generation in K562/IMA-1 cells. However, expression levels of sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) and generation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were increased significantly in K562/IMA-1 cells, channeling sphingoid bases to the sphingosine kinase pathway. The partial inhibition of SK1 expression by small interference RNA modulated S1P levels and increased sensitivity to imatinib-induced apoptosis in resistant cells. On the other hand, forced expression of SK1 in K562 cells increased the ratio between total S1P/C18-ceramide levels ∼6-fold and prevented apoptosis significantly in response to imatinib. Additional data indicated a role for SK1/S1P signaling in the up-regulation of the Bcr-Abl expression at the post-transcriptional level, which suggested a possible mechanism for resistance to imatinib-mediated apoptosis. In conclusion, these data suggest a role for endogenous C18-ceramide synthesis mainly via hLASS1 in imatinib-induced apoptosis in sensitive cells, whereas in resistant cells, alterations of the balance between the levels of ceramide and S1P by overexpression of SK1 result in resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis.

Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S14-S18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). There is an elevated but immature white blood cell count in CML. The natural history of CML follows a progression from a chronic phase to an accelerated phase or to a rapidly fatal blast crisis within 3–5 years in patients. Blood cells differentiate normally in the chronic phase but not in the blast phase (2Kantarjian H. Dixon D. Keating M.J. Talpaz M. Walters R.S. McCredie K.B. Freireich E.J. Cancer. 1988; 61: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). CML is usually diagnosed by the presence of an abnormal Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which results from a translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22. This exchange brings together two genes: the Bcr gene on chromosome 22 and the proto-oncogene Abl on chromosome 9 (3Rowley J.D. Nature. 1973; 243: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (3381) Google Scholar). The resulting hybrid gene, Bcr-Abl, encodes for a fusion protein with tyrosine kinase activity, which mediates signal transduction pathways, leading to uncontrolled growth. One of the major advancements in the treatment of CML has been the development of imatinib (imatinib mesylate, STI571, Gleevec), which shows striking activity in the chronic and accelerated phases but has less activity in the blast phase of the disease (4Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Mett H. Meyer T. Muller M. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 100-104PubMed Google Scholar). Imatinib directly associates with the ATP-binding site of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase and prevents the kinase activity of the enzyme (5Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Bcr-Abl by imatinib results in the transcriptional modulation of various genes involved in the control of cell cycle, cell adhesion, and cytoskeleton organization, leading to apoptotic cell death (6Gunby R.H. Piazza R. Galietta A. Rostagno R. Scapozza L. Lancet Oncol. 2003; 4: 75-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Despite high rates of hematological and cytogenetic responses to therapy, the emergence of resistance to imatinib has been recognized as a major problem in the treatment of patients with CML (7Hegedus T.

Development of resistance to imatinib includes Bcr-Abl-dependent or -independent mechanisms, such as modification of the target Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase through gene amplification/mutation, or through a reduction in drug concentration by overexpression of MDR1 gene, respectively (7Hegedus T.

The sphingolipids are a family of membrane lipids, including ceramide, ceramide 1-phosphate, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, galactosylceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), with important structural roles in the regulation of the fluidity and sub-domain structure of the lipid bilayers (11Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). These molecules are known to exert essential roles in many aspects of cell biology, such as inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, and senescence (12Hannun Y.A.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Many cytokines, anticancer drugs and other stress-causing agonists result in increases in endogenous ceramide levels through the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and/or the de novo synthesis (15Futerman A.H.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the de novo generation of ceramide can be regulated by the mammalian homologues of the yeast longevity assurance gene (LASS1–6) (18Guillas I. Kirchman P.A.

Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1259-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, overexpression of each of these genes in various mammalian cells was shown to regulate the generation of ceramides containing fatty acids with different chain lengths (21Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

J. 2005; 390: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). For example, LASS1 was shown to selectively regulate the synthesis of C18-ceramide (21Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J.

Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), whereas LASS2 and LASS4 increase the levels of C22- and C24-ceramides, and LASS5 and LASS6 produce shorter ceramide species C14- and C16-ceramides (22Mizutani Y. Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 23Riebeling C. Allegood J.C. Wang E. Merrill A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43452-43459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Recently, LASS5 has been shown as a bona fide ceramide synthase for the generation of mainly C16-ceramide (24Lahiri S. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33735-33738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although ceramide is anti-proliferative, S1P has been implicated to promote cellular differentiation, proliferation, migration, cytoskeletal reorganization, cellular proliferation, and survival (25Spiegel S. Kolesnick R. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In cells, many external stimuli, particularly growth and survival factors, activate sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1), leading to increased generation of S1P, which is known to function either endogenously, or exogenously by engaging with S1P receptors, S1PRs (26Xia P. Gable J.R. Wang L. Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Wattenburg B.W. D'Andrea R.J. Vadas M.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1527-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 27Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been well documented previously that increased S1P by SK1 protects, whereas depletion of S1P enhances, ceramide-induced apoptosis (27Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28Bektas M. Jolly P.S. Muller C. Eberle J. Spiegel S. Geilen C.C.

FASEB J. 2006; 20: 482-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of the ceramide/S1P rheostat (30Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) is critical to determine the fate of cells for death or survival. Involvement of sphingolipids in the regulation of imatinib-induced cell death and/or resistance in human CML cells has not been examined previously. Therefore, in this study, possible roles of ceramide/S1P pathway in the mechanisms of resistance to imatinib in K562 cells were determined. The data presented here showed that treatment with imatinib results in increased generation of endogenous ceramides, mainly C18-ceramide in the sensitive parental K562 cell line and not in its resistant sub-clones in response to imatinib. Additional data with molecular approaches showed that LASS1-dependent generation of C18-ceramide plays important roles in mediating imatinib-induced apoptosis in these cells. Importantly, in resistant cells, although C18-ceramide synthesis was functional, the balance between C18-ceramide/S1P levels by the overexpression of SK1 was altered. Moreover, the data presented here indicated that SK1/S1P plays a role in the regulation of Bcr-Abl expression, which is mechanistically involved in the development of resistance to imatinib-mediated apoptosis. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The Ph chromosome-positive K562 human CML cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures and maintained in RPMI 1640 growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Selection of Imatinib-resistant K562 Cells—Cells maintained in liquid cultures were exposed to stepwise increasing concentrations of imatinib, which was kindly provided by Novartis, Switzerland, starting with a concentration of 0.05 μm. Subpopulations of cells that were able to grow in the presence of 0.2 and 1 μm imatinib, were then selected, and referred to as K562/IMA-0.2 and -1 cells, respectively. Then, the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC)50 values of imatinib, which inhibited the growth of the cell population by 50%, were determined and compared with control sensitive parental cells as described below. Measurement of Growth by MTT or Trypan Blue Exclusion Assays—The IC50 values of imatinib that inhibited cell growth by 50% were determined from cell survival plots obtained by MTT or trypan blue exclusion assays (31Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In short, cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were plated into 96-well plates containing 100 μl of the growth medium in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of imatinib at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 72 h. They were then treated with 5 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml) for 4 h. After lysing the cells in 50 μl of the lysis buffer, the plates were read in a microplate reader (Dynatech) at 570 nm. After that, the IC50 concentrations of the compound were determined from cell survival plots as described (31Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Triplicate wells were used for each treatment. For trypan blue exclusion analysis (31Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were grown in 6-well plates with 2 ml of media in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of imatinib for 48 h. Then, cells were counted using a hemocytometer in the presence of trypan blue solution at a 1:1 ratio (v/v) (Sigma), as described by the manufacturer. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle profiles were examined by flow cytometry using propidium iodine labeling as described previously (31Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44311-44319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and sub-G0/G1 cell populations were considered apoptotic. Detection of the Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The collapse of an electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis was measured using a JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit (Cell Technology) by flow cytometry as described previously (32Koybasi S. Senkal C.E. Sundararaj K. Spassieva S. Bielawski J. Osta W. Day T.A. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44311-44319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This kit uses a unique cationic dye, JC-1, to signal the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In healthy cells, the dye accumulates in the mitochondria as aggregates, which become fluorescent red. In apoptotic cells, the mitochondrial potential collapses, and the JC-1 cannot accumulate within the mitochondria and remains in the cytoplasm as a green fluorescent monomeric form. These different forms of JC-1 were then detected by flow cytometry as described by the manufacturer. Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activity was determined using the caspase-3 colorimetric assay (R&D Systems) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, after lysis, cell extracts were used for caspase-3 activity by the addition of a caspase-3-specific peptide that was conjugated to the fluorescent reporter molecule 7-amino-4-trifluoromethly coumarin. In this assay, cleavage of the peptide by caspase-3 releases the fluorochrome that emits fluorescence at 505 nm, after excitation at 400 nm wavelength. The levels of caspase-3 enzymatic activity are directly proportional to the fluorescence signal detected using a fluorescent microplate reader. Caspase-3 activity levels were normalized to total protein amounts for each sample. Measurement of Ceramide Levels by HPLC/MS—The cellular levels of endogenous ceramides and sphingomyelin were measured using high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) as described previously (32Koybasi S.

In short, after cells were collected by centrifugation, lipids were extracted directly from cell pellets, and the levels of sphingolipids and inorganic phosphate levels in the same extracts were measured as described (32Koybasi S.

The in vitro enzyme activity of ceramide synthase was also measured using microsomal preparations of the cells by monitoring the conversion of [3H]dihydrosphingosine into ceramides in the presence of steraoyl- or plamitoyl-CoAs by TLC as described previously (24Lahiri S.

Plasmids and Transfections—The pCMV-exSVneo/LASS1 was kindly provided by Dr. S. M. Jawzwinski. The human LASS2, LASS5, and LASS6 were cloned from a human cDNA library by PCR and subcloned in pCMV-exSVneo. Transfection of human CML cells was performed using an Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. siRNAs—LASS1, SK1, and non-targeting (scrambled) siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon. Cells were transfected by siRNA (100 nm for 48 h) using DharmaFECT™ siRNA transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer. The target sequences for LASS1 and SK1 siRNAs were as follows: LASS1, 5′-AAGGTCCTGTATGCCACCAGT-3′; LASS5, 5′-AAACCCTGTGCACTCTGTATT-3′; LASS6, 5′-AAGGTCTTCACTGCAATTACA-3′; and SK1, 5′-AAGGGCAAGGCCTTGCAGCTC. Isolation of Total RNA and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using reverse transcriptase (Promega). After 1 h of incubation at 50 °C, the reactions were stopped at 95 °C for 5 min. The resulting total cDNA was then used in PCR to measure the mRNA levels of LASS1, LASS6, SK1, and β-actin. The mRNA levels of β-actin were used as internal control (30Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The primer sequences and PCR conditions were as follows: LASS1-forward (5′-CTATACATGGACACCTGGCGCAA-3′), LASS1-reverse (5′-TCAGAAGCGCTTGTCCTTCACCA-3′); LASS6-forward (5′-CCTCGAGGGATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGATGGCAGGGATCTTAGCCTGG-3′), LASS6-reverse (5′-CGGAATTCCGTTAATCATCCATGGAGCAGGA-3′); SK1-forward (5′-CCGACGAGGACTTTGTGCTAAT-3′), SK1-reverse (5′-GCCTGTCCCCCCAAAGCATAAC-3′); and β-actin-forward (5′-CAGAGCAAGAGAGGCATCCT-3′), β-actin-reverse (5′-TTGAAGGTCTCAAACATGAT-3′). 1 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction was amplified using these primers by PCR for 35 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55–68 °C for 2.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min), and their levels were normalized to that of β-actin as described previously (31Ogretmen B.

The mRNA levels were quantified using the ChemiDoc-XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad) after running RT-PCR products in agarose gels, followed by ethidium bromide staining. Quantitative real-time PCR for the measurement of mRNA levels of human SK1, Abl, LASS1, LASS2, LASS4, LASS5, LASS6, and rRNA were performed using TaqMan® gene expression kit and gene-specific real-time-PCR TaqMan primer/probe mix (Applied Biosystems) with ABI 7300 Q-PCR system as described by the manufacturer. Western Blot Analysis—The protein levels of Bcr-Abl, SK1, and β-actin were detected by Western blot analysis (33Sultan I. Senkal C.E. Ponnusamy S. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Ogretmen B. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In short, total proteins (50 μg/lane) were separated by 5–15% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), blotted onto a nylon membrane, and Bcr-Abl, SK1, and β-actin proteins were detected using 1 μg/ml of mouse monoclonal anti-c-Abl Ab-3 (Calbiochem), rabbit polyclonal anti-SK1 (29Taha T.A.

The proteins were visualized using the ECL protein detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Statistical Analysis—Experiments were performed at least in two independent trials as duplicates or triplicates. Statistical significance was examined using analysis of variance or Student's t test analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Long Term Exposure to Increasing Concentrations of Imatinib Results in the Development of Resistance to Apoptosis—To explore the mechanisms involved in the development of resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis, human K562 CML cells were exposed to stepwise increasing concentrations of the drug (50–1000 nm) for several months, and the sub-clones that expressed resistance were selected. First, the degree of resistance was determined by measuring the IC50 values of imatinib at 72 h using MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, K562 cells that survived upon chronic exposure to 200 or 1000 nm imatinib, which were referred to as K562/IMA-0.2, and -1, respectively, expressed ∼2.3- to 19-fold resistance, as compared with their parental sensitive counterparts. The IC50 values of imatinib were 240, 565, and 4,600 nm for K562, K562/IMA-0.2, and -1 cells, respectively (Fig. 1A). Similarly, treatment with 200 and 500 nm imatinib for 48 h decreased the viability of K562 cells ∼30 and 50%, respectively, whereas there was no significant change in the viability of resistant cells in response to imatinib at these concentrations as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 1B). In addition, the cell cycle profiles of sensitive and resistant cells were examined by flow cytometry. The data revealed that, although exposure to 500 nm imatinib for 48 h caused apoptosis in ∼70% of the population in sensitive K562 cells, there was no detectable apoptosis in resistant K562/IMA-0.2 cells (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). There were no significant changes in the cell cycle profiles of K562/IMA-0.2 cells as compared with their parental controls (Fig. 2, A and B). These data demonstrate that continuous exposure results in the selection of cells that express resistance to imatinib-induced cell death in human K562 cells. These results were also confirmed by measuring various parameters of apoptosis such as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, or the activation of procaspase-3. Treatment with 200–500 nm imatinib for 48 h caused a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, as measured by increased accumulation of cytoplasmic monomeric form of JC-1 (31Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), in sensitive K562, but not in resistant K562/IMA-0.2 cells (Fig. 2C). In addition, treatment of sensitive K562 cells with 200 or 500 nm imatinib for 48 h resulted in a significant activation of caspase-3 (∼10- or 13-fold, respectively), whereas treatment of K562/IMA-0.2 or -1 cells at these concentrations did not have any significant effects on the activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 2D). Thus, these data confirmed that K562/IMA-0.2 and -1 cells exert significant resistance to imatinib-induced caspase activation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Ceramide Levels Increase in Imatinib-sensitive, but Not in Resistant Cells, in Response to Imatinib Treatment—To examine whether ceramide synthesis/metabolism is involved in mechanisms of resistance to imatinib, the levels of endogenous ceramide in K562 and K562/IMA-0.2 cells, treated in the absence or presence of 500 nm imatinib (48 h), were measured by HPLC/MS. Interestingly, the data showed that treatment with imatinib resulted in a significant increase in the generation of endogenous ceramides, particularly in C18-ceramide (∼30-fold), and to a lesser extent, C14-, C16-, and C20-ceramides (∼2- to 8-fold) in sensitive K562 cells when compared with untreated controls (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Table S1).

Genes annotated as thymidine phosphorylase ( deoA ) and eucaryal translation initiation factor 2B ( e2b2 ) were found to encode AMP phosphorylase and ribose-1,5-bisphosphate isomerase, respectively. These enzymes supplied the RuBisCO substrate, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, from AMP and phosphate. Archaea with type III RuBisCOs all harbor both DeoA and the corresponding E2b2 homologs. In this pathway, adenine was released from AMP and the phosphoribose moiety entered central-carbon metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2035077457,"Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is an allosteric activator and second messenger implicated in the regulation of a variety of biological processes in diverse bacteria. In Vibrio cholerae, c-di-GMP has been shown to inversely regulate biofilm-specific and virulence gene expression, suggesting that c-di-GMP signaling is important for the transition of V. cholerae from the environment to the host. However, the mechanism behind this regulation remains unknown. Recently, it was proposed that the PilZ protein domain represents a c-di-GMP-binding domain. Here we show that V. cholerae PilZ proteins bind c-di-GMP specifically and are involved in the regulation of biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. These findings confirm a role for PilZ proteins as c-di-GMP-sensing proteins within the c-di-GMP signaling network."
https://openalex.org/W2114185596,"Tau is the major microtubule-associated protein in neuronal axons. It aggregates into ""neurofibrillary tangles"" during the course of Alzheimer disease. Binding to microtubules and microtubule assembly requires the ""repeat domain"" in the C-terminal half of Tau, as well as the two regions flanking the repeats. Here we report the NMR characterization of a 198-residue Tau fragment composed of the four tandem repeats and the flanking domains and containing the full microtubule binding and assembly activity of Tau. NMR secondary chemical shifts and dipolar couplings detect the highest propensity for β-structure within the four-repeat region, whereas the flanking domains are largely random coil, with an increased rigidity in the proline-rich region. Chemical shift perturbation experiments identify two motifs in the upstream flanking domain, <sup>225</sup>KVAVVRT<sup>231</sup> and <sup>243</sup>LQTA<sup>246</sup>, and one downstream of the repeats, <sup>370</sup>KIETHKTFREN<sup>380</sup>, which strongly contribute to the binding to the acidic outside of microtubules, as well as to the binding of other polyanions such as heparin. This is consistent with the ""jaws"" model of Tau-microtubule interactions and highlights the importance of the regions flanking the repeats for both microtubule binding and pathological Tau aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2004516461,"Abstract We have previously demonstrated that hexanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C6-ceramide), an anti-mitogenic cell-permeable lipid metabolite, limited vascular smooth muscle growth by abrogating trauma-induced Akt activity in a stretch injury model of neointimal hyperplasia. Furthermore, ceramide selectively and directly activated protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) to suppress Akt-dependent mitogenesis. To further analyze the interaction between ceramide and PKCζ, the ability of ceramide to localize within highly structured lipid microdomains (rafts) and activate PKCζ was investigated. Using rat aorta vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5), we now demonstrate that C6-ceramide treatment results in an increased localization and phosphorylation of PKCζ within caveolin-enriched lipid microdomians to inactivate Akt. In addition, ceramide specifically reduced the association of PKCζ with 14-3-3, a scaffold protein localized to less structured regions within membranes. Pharmacological disruption of highly structured lipid microdomains resulted in abrogation of ceramide-activated, PKCζ-dependent Akt inactivation, whereas molecular strategies suggest that ceramide-dependent PKCζ phosphorylation of Akt3 at Ser34 was necessary for ceramide-induced vascular smooth muscle cell growth arrest. Taken together, these data demonstrate that structured membrane microdomains are necessary for ceramide-induced activation of PKCζ and resultant diminished Akt activity, leading to vascular smooth muscle cell growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2146007259,"Lymphocyte apoptosis plays a central role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Lymphocyte apoptosis was examined in mice with defective death receptor pathways due to transgenic expression of a dominant negative mutant of Fas-associated death domain (FADD-DN) or Bid-/- and in mice with defective mitochondrial-mediated pathways due to loss of Bim-/-, Puma-/-, or Noxa-/-. FADD-DN transgenic and Bid-/- mice had significant albeit incomplete protection, and this protection was associated with increased survival. Surprisingly, splenic B cells were also protected in FADD-DN mice although transgene expression was confined to T cells, providing evidence for an indirect protective mechanism. Bim-/- provided virtually complete protection against lymphocyte apoptosis whereas Puma-/- and Noxa-/- mice had modest or no protection, respectively. Bim-/- mice had improved survival, and adoptive transfer of splenocytes from Bim-/- mice into Rag 1-/- mice demonstrated that this was a lymphocyte intrinsic effect. The improved survival was associated with decreased interleukin (IL) -10 and IL-6 cytokines. Collectively, these data indicate that numerous death stimuli are generated during sepsis, and it therefore appears unlikely that blocking a single ""trigger"" can inhibit apoptosis. If siRNA becomes practical therapeutically, proapoptotic proteins would be potential targets."
https://openalex.org/W2000392076,"Ectodomain shedding and intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by α-, β- and γ-secretase are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Increased proteolytic processing and secretion of another membrane protein, the interleukin-1 receptor II (IL-1R2), have also been linked to the pathogenesis of AD. IL-1R2 is a decoy receptor that may limit detrimental effects of IL-1 in the brain. At present, the proteolytic processing of IL-1R2 remains little understood. Here we show that IL-1R2 can be proteolytically processed in a manner similar to APP. IL-1R2 expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells first undergoes ectodomain shedding in an α-secretase-like manner, resulting in secretion of the IL-1R2 ectodomain and the generation of an IL-1R2 C-terminal fragment. This fragment undergoes further intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase, leading to the generation of the soluble intracellular domain of IL-1R2. Intramembrane cleavage of IL-1R2 was abolished by a highly specific inhibitor of γ-secretase and was absent in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in γ-secretase activity. Surprisingly, the β-secretase BACE1 and its homolog BACE2 increased IL-1R2 secretion resulting in C-terminal fragments nearly identical to the ones generated by the α-secretase-like cleavage. This suggests that both proteases may act as alternative α-secretase-like proteases. Importantly, BACE1 and BACE2 did not cleave several other membrane proteins, demonstrating that both proteases do not contribute to general membrane protein turnover but only cleave specific proteins.

Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The first cleavage is referred to as ectodomain shedding and occurs within the ectodomain at a peptide bond very close to the transmembrane domain. This results in the secretion of most of the ectodomain (reviewed in Refs. 3Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 4Huovila A.P. Turner A.J.

Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Numerous type I membrane proteins, including Notch, CD44, and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), undergo RIP. The ectodomain shedding is carried out by members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family and additionally by matrix metalloproteases and to a lower extent by the aspartyl proteases BACE1 and BACE2 (β-site APP-cleaving enzymes 1 and 2) (for a review see Ref. 6Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The subsequent intramembrane proteolysis is catalyzed by the γ-secretase protease complex, consisting of the essential proteins PS1 and PS2 (presenilin 1 or 2), nicastrin, Pen-2, and Aph-1 (for a review see Ref. 7Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The presenilins are assumed to constitute the active site of γ-secretase by providing two aspartic acid residues that are critical for γ-secretase activity (8Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Nicastrin functions as a receptor for γ-secretase substrates (9Shah S. Lee S.F.

As a result of γ-secretase cleavage, the C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of type I membrane proteins are processed to two smaller fragments. A small peptide is secreted into the extracellular space, whereas the intracellular domain is released into the cytosol. For some of these proteins, such as the cell surface receptor Notch and the cell adhesion proteins N- and E-cadherin, the liberated intracellular domain may participate in signal transduction through different mechanisms (2Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), whereas for other proteins, such as APP, the intracellular domain may be degraded without a prior role in signaling (10Hebert S.S. Serneels L. Tolia A. Craessaerts K. Derks C. Filippov M.A. Muller U. De Strooper B. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).One of the proteins, for which RIP has been studied in much detail, is APP. In contrast to several other proteins undergoing RIP, the ectodomain cleavage of APP is not only catalyzed by one but by three different proteases, which cleave at distinct peptide bonds. Shedding of APP mainly occurs by an ADAM metalloprotease, which is also referred to as α-secretase and cleaves within the Aβ sequence (reviewed in Ref. 11Allinson T.M. Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Additionally, BACE1 (also referred to as β-secretase) and its homolog BACE2 cleave in the ectodomain of APP. BACE1 cleaves APP at the N terminus of the Aβ peptide domain, thus catalyzing the first step in the generation of the Aβ peptide (reviewed in Ref. 12Citron M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 92-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which is deposited in the brain of patients suffering from Alzheimer disease (AD) (reviewed in Ref. 13Selkoe D.J. Schenk D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 545-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). BACE2 cleaves APP close to the α-secretase cleavage site within the Aβ domain and thus acts as an alternative α-secretase (14Yan R. Munzner J.B. Shuck M.E. Bienkowski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34019-34027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), preventing the release of an intact Aβ peptide.An additional substrate for ectodomain shedding is the type II receptor for interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is widely expressed, including neurons (15French R.A. VanHoy R.W. Chizzonite R. Zachary J.F. Dantzer R. Parnet P. Bluthe R.M. Kelley K.W. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 93: 194-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). IL-1 is a potent inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokine and is a key factor in the events leading to neurodegeneration following brain trauma, stroke, and brain inflammation. IL-1 can bind to two types of receptors (for an overview see Ref. 16Mantovani A. Locati M. Vecchi A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 328-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Binding to the type I receptor (IL-1R1) initiates a signaling cascade that finally leads to NFκB activation. In contrast, the type II receptor (IL-1R2) acts as a decoy receptor, which is capable of binding IL-1 but is incapable of signaling to NFκB and thus acts as a “ligand sink” preventing IL-1 from binding to IL-1R1. IL-1R2 is a single-span membrane protein that contains a large extracellular ligand-binding domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain of 29 amino acids. This cytoplasmic domain lacks the Toll/IL-1R domain found in the type I receptor, which would be required for the signal transduction by binding and recruiting cytosolic adaptors and kinases, such as MyD88 and IRAK. IL-1 and its signaling have been implicated in multiple ways in AD (reviewed in Ref. 17Griffin W.S. Nicoll J.A. Grimaldi L.M. Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet well understood. For example, brain trauma, which is a risk factor for AD, enhances IL-1 expression. Likewise, increased IL-1 expression has been observed in AD (reviewed in Ref. 18Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In turn, overnight stimulation of astrocytes with IL-1 strongly stimulates translation of APP mRNA, leading to increased APP protein levels (19Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Potentially, this may result in increased Aβ peptide generation. However, short term treatment of neuroglioma cells with IL-1 has also been shown to stimulate α-secretase cleavage of APP (20Ma G. Chen S. Wang X. Ba M. Yang H. Lu G. J. Neurosci.

Genetic analyses have linked polymorphisms in the two IL-1 genes, IL-1α and IL-1β, to an increased risk of AD. Interestingly, both polymorphisms appear to increase IL-1 production in vitro or in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 18Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). An additional connection between IL-1 and AD is the finding that the soluble, secreted form of IL-1R2 is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with mild to moderate AD but not in the late stages of the disease (22Lindberg C. Chromek M. Ahrengart L. Brauner A. Schultzberg M. Garlind A. Neurochem. Int. 2005; 46: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Garlind A. Brauner A. Hojeberg B. Basun H. Schultzberg M. Brain Res. 1999; 826: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Given that secreted IL-1R2 binds IL-1 and acts as a sink for IL-1, the increase in IL-1R2 shedding may be a way of trying to limit detrimental consequences of increased IL-1 expression and activity in the brain. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the proteolytic processing of IL-1R2 are little understood, but the processing seems to depend at least partly on a metalloprotease activity (24Cui X. Rouhani F.N. Hawari F. Levine S.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6814-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Orlando S. Sironi M. Bianchi G. Drummond A.H. Boraschi D. Yabes D. Mantovani A. J.

A more detailed knowledge of IL-1R2 processing may help to better understand the role of IL-1R2 secretion and of IL-1 in the AD brain. Here we show that IL-1R2 undergoes a similar set of proteolytic cleavages as APP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The following antibodies were used: anti-HA epitope antibody HA.11 (Covance); anti-FLAGM2 antibody, anti-FLAGM2-agarose, anti-HA-9658 antibody, anti-BACE1-NT antibody, and HA-agarose (Sigma); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibody (DAKO); Alexa 488-coupled anti-rabbit and Alexa 594 anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes); anti-BACE1 and BACE2 (ProSci, against their C termini).

BACE2-Fc fusion protein was kindly provided by Regina Fluhrer.Plasmid Construction—Generation of vector peak12 expressing BACE1, BACE2, and HA-tagged alkaline phosphatase (AP) (HA-AP, soluble AP) has been described (32Lichtenthaler S.F.

The cDNAs of all shedding substrates are of human origin. Plasmid peak12/PSGL-1 3tag was described previously (32Lichtenthaler S.F. Dominguez D.I. Westmeyer G.G. Reiss K. Haass C. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Seed B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48713-48719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and encodes the signal peptide of CD5, followed by an HA epitope tag and the coding sequence of PSGL-1 with an AU1 tag in the extracellular domain and a FLAG tag in the cytoplasmic domain. The PSGL-1 sequence can be cut out using an XbaI and a NotI restriction site. Peak12/HA-Xba-FLAG was generated by PCR and encodes an HA tag between the HindIII and the XbaI site and a FLAG tag between the XbaI and the NotI site. To obtain peak12/CD5-HA-Xba-FLAG, the HindIII/XbaI fragment of peak12/PSGL-1 3tag was cloned into peak12/HA-Xba-FLAG and encodes the CD5 signal peptide followed by an HA and a FLAG tag. The plasmids encoding full-length IL-1R2 or its deletion mutant (lacking part of the ectodomain) (peak12/IL-1R2, peak12/Δ334-IL-1R2 and peak12/Δ322-IL-1R2) carry the CD5 signal peptide (MPMGSLQPLATLYLLGMLVASVLG), an N-terminal HA tag (YPYDVPDYA followed by the linker sequence SGGGGGLE or SGGGGGLD for the Δ334 mutant), and a C-terminal FLAG tag and were generated by PCR using appropriate primers. Peak12/Δ329-IL-1R2 was generated in the same way but has no N-terminal HA tag. The PCR fragments (lacking the native signal peptide sequence of IL-1R2) were cloned into the XbaI site of peak12/CD5-HA-Xba-FLAG. Thus, the first amino acid of the IL-1R2 sequence is amino acid Gly-23 of full-length IL-1R2 (numbering corresponding to protein accession number NP_004624 in the NCBI data base). Amino acid numbers of the IL-1R2 deletion mutants (Δ322, Δ329, and Δ334) indicate that the deletions stop before the given amino acid number, which refers to its position within the HA-IL-1R2-FLAG full-length sequence (counting without the CD5 signal peptide). Vector peak12/MMP-IL-1R2 was used for retroviral generation and was obtained by cloning the Hin-dIII/NotI fragment of peak12/IL-1R2 into the HindIII/NotI sites of the peak12/MMP-KilA vector (33Randow F. Seed B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). An additional IRES-GFP cassette from peak12/MMP-TK-IRES-GFP (obtained from Felix Randow; IRES is of encephalomyocarditis virus origin) was cloned into the NotI site of peak12/MMP-IL-1R2 to yield peak12/MMP-IL-1R2-IRES-GFP. Vectors pMDtet.G and pMD.gagpol were described previously (34Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The coding sequences of CD14 (GPI-anchored protein), CD16 (GPI-anchored protein), and P-selectin (all three lacking the native signal peptide sequence) were amplified by PCR, digested with XbaI and NotI, and cloned into plasmid peak12/PSGL-1 3tag, which was cut with XbaI and NotI. The resulting plasmids encode the CD5 signal peptide followed by an HA epitope tag and the corresponding protein sequence. As templates, pCDM12/CD14 and CD16 (obtained from Brian Seed) and pCMV/P-selectin (obtained from Denisa Wagner) were used. Peak12/pro-TGFα-HA encodes human pro-TGFα with an HA tag inserted between amino acids His-43 and Phe-44, which is four amino acids C-terminal to the Ala-Val propeptide cleavage site. Thus, after signal peptide and propeptide cleavage, the mature pro-TGFα and the soluble TGFα retain the HA tag. Peak12/HA-pro-TGFα-FLAG contains an additional FLAG tag at the C terminus of pro-TGFα and was generated by cloning the HindIII/XbaI-digested PCR fragment of HA-tagged pro-TGFα into the HindIII and XbaI sites of peak12/CD5-HA-XBA-FLAG. TGFα and TNFα cDNAs were from ATCC. Peak12/FLAG-TNFα-HA was created by cloning a PCR fragment of FLAG-TNFα containing a 5′-HindIII site and a 3′-XbaI site that was then inserted into HindIII/XbaI peak vector, which has an HA tag between the XbaI and the NotI site. The N-terminal, cytoplasmic FLAG tag was added to TNFα by PCR and suitable primers and was cloned into the HindIII/NotI sites of the peak12 vector, resulting in peak12/FLAG-TNFα. For expression in neurons and glial cells IL-1R2, TGFα and CD16 were cut out from the corresponding peak12 plasmids using HindIII and NotI, blunt-ended, and ligated into the SmaI site of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) type 1. The identity of all constructs obtained by PCR was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture, Transfections, Western Blot—Human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) as described (35Neumann S.

Cells stably expressing wild-type PS1 or its catalytically inactive mutant PS1 D385N are HEK293 cells without the EBNA gene (36Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured as above with an additional 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). G418 was added to culture murine embryonic fibroblasts PS1/2-/- knock-out cells. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). One day after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. After overnight incubation, conditioned medium and cell lysate (in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) were collected.To analyze the effect of PMA and TAPI-1 on shedding, cells were treated as described previously (32Lichtenthaler S.F.

For the detection of secreted and cellular APP by immunoblot, the protein concentration in the cell lysate was measured, and corresponding aliquots of lysate or conditioned medium were directly loaded onto an electrophoresis gel. For transient transfections of IL-1R2, TGFα, CD14, and CD16 either together with BACE1 or BACE2, alkaline phosphatase (AP; plasmid HA-AP) was cotransfected as a transfection efficiency control. AP activity was measured as described previously (32Lichtenthaler S.F. Dominguez D.I. Westmeyer G.G. Reiss K. Haass C. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Seed B. J. Biol.

Aliquots of the conditioned medium were treated for 30 min at 65 °C to heat-inactivate the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. Corresponding aliquots of lysate or conditioned medium were loaded onto the gel. Immunoblot detection was carried out using the indicated antibodies.Infection of Primary Neurons and Glial Cells with SFV—Cortical neurons and glial cells were prepared from E14 mouse embryos from BACE1-deficient and BACE1, BACE2 double-deficient mice as described (38De Strooper B.

Virus was diluted 1:100 in conditioned culture medium and added to 4-day-old neurons. Two hours post-infection, cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 6 h and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in TBS buffer). IL-1R2, TGFα, and CD16 full-length and CTFs were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitated material was separated by SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Retroviral Transduction—To produce retroviral supernatants (replication-deficient Moloney murine leukemia virus), plasmids pMDtet.G and pMD.gagpol and either peak12/MMP-GFP or peak12/MMP-HA-IL-1R2-FLAG-IRES-GFP were transfected into HEK293 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. Medium was changed after 24 h, collected after 48 h, and filtered through a sterile filter. The retroviral transductions were carried out using Polybrene (Sigma).In Vitro Generation of IL-1R2-ICD—293E cells transiently expressing full-length IL-1R2 were incubated for 4 h with PMA prior to membrane preparation. Membrane preparations were generated as described (41Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and were resuspended in citrate buffer (pH 6.4, 5 mm EDTA, inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science) with or without 1 μm DAPT and then incubated either at 4 or 37 °C for 2 h. After incubation the supernatant and membranes were separated via ultracentrifugation. HEK293 cells (without EBNA) stably expressing wild-type PS1 or PS1 D385N and additionally transiently expressing peak12/Δ329-IL-1R2-FLAG were directly subjected to membrane preparation without prior PMA incubation and then treated as above.Coimmunoprecipitation of γ-Secretase Complex with IL-1R2 Substrate—HA-IL-1R2-FLAG was retrovirally transduced into HEK293 cells stably expressing either PS1 WT or the catalytic inactive mutant PS1 D385N. For immunoprecipitation, one 10-cm dish of each cell line was lysed in standard STE (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA) + 1% CHAPSO buffer followed by a clarifying spin at 13,000 rpm with a Heraeus cryocentrifuge and a further purification step at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman ultracentrifuge with a TLA-55 rotor. Prior to immunoprecipitation of CTFs with FLAG M2 affinity agarose, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA affinity agarose for 2 h leading to a depletion of IL-1R2 full-length protein in the lysate. Subsequently, after a 2-h incubation with the lysate, FLAG M2-agarose was washed two times each with 0.1% CHAPSO wash buffer and STE buffer and afterward eluted with 100 μg of FLAG peptide and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot detection was carried out for IL-1R2 CTF and the γ-secretase complex components nicastrin, presenilin 1 NTF, Aph-1, and Pen-2.Mass Spectrometry of IL-1R2 Cleavage Sites—For analysis of α-, β-, and γ-cleavage of secreted IL-1R2 peptides, HEK293 cells were transfected with peak12/IL-1R2, peak12/Δ334-IL-1R2, or peak12/Δ322-IL-1R2. 48 h after transfection, fresh medium was incubated for 4 h and subsequently put on ice. In case of peak12-Δ322-IL-1R2, medium was supplemented with 1 mmol of DAPT during incubation to prevent turnover by γ-secretase. Protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added at a dilution of 1:100. Medium was then subjected to a clarifying spin by centrifugation. Afterward medium was subjected to immunoprecipitation with HA-agarose beads for 4 h in the case of Δ334-IL1R2 construct and for 2 h in the case of Δ322-IL1R2 construct. Bound peptides were eluted either with a mixture of 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile, H2O saturated with α-cyano matrix, or in the case of the IL-1R2 ectodomain with HA peptide (50 μg) in 300 mm NaCl for MALDI-TOF analysis (Voyager DESTR, Applied Biosystems) and with 0.1% formic acid, 50% methanol, H2O for nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis (Q-STAR Applied Biosystems).

In an effort to define the biological functions of COMP, a functional genetic screen based on the yeast two-hybrid system was performed. This led to the identification of granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP), an autocrine growth factor, as a COMP-associated partner. COMP directly binds to GEP both in vitro and in vivo, as revealed by in vitro pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. GEP selectively interacts with the epidermal growth factor repeat domain of COMP but not with the other three functional domains of COMP. The granulin A repeat unit of GEP is required and sufficient for association with COMP. COMP co-localizes with GEP predominantly in the pericellular matrix of transfected rat chondrosarcoma cell and primary human chondrocytes. Staining of musculoskeletal tissues of day 19 mouse embryo with antibodies to GEP is restricted to chondrocytes in the lower proliferative and upper hypertrophic zones. Overexpression of GEP stimulates the proliferation of chondrocytes, and this stimulation is enhanced by COMP. In addition, COMP appears to be required for GEP-mediated chondrocyte proliferation, since chondrocyte proliferation induced by GEP is dramatically inhibited by an anti-COMP antibody. These findings provide the first evidence linking the association of COMP and GEP and identifying a previously unrecognized growth factor (i.e. GEP) in cartilage.

During mouse development, COMP staining has been described in the pericellular matrix of maturing articular chondrocytes (25Susic S. McGrory J. Ahier J. Cole W.G. Clin. Genet. 1997; 51: 219-224PubMed Google Scholar), and during rat development it has been associated mainly with the growth plate (3Di Cesare P.E. Fang C. Leslie M.P. Tulli H. Perris R. Carlson C.S. J. Orthop. Res. 2000; 18: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These in vivo data suggested that COMP may play important roles in chondrogenesis and cartilage development. One of the aims of the present study, therefore, was to isolate the proteins that associate with COMP in order to elucidate its biological functions in skeletogenesis. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the EGF domain of COMP as bait led to the isolation of granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP) as a COMP-binding growth factor. GEP, also referred to as progranulin, proepithelin, PC cell-derived growth factor, or acrogranin, is a 68.5-kDa secreted growth factor. It is heavily glycosylated and appears as an ∼90-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE. Structurally, it belongs to none of the well established growth factor families. GEP is secreted in an intact form (26Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 27Zhou J. Gao G. Crabb J.W. Serrero G. J.

Individual granulins have an approximate molecular mass of 6 kDa and are structurally defined by the presence of 12 cysteines arranged in a characteristic motif: X2-3CX5-6CX5CCX8CCX6CCX5CCX4CX5-6CX2 (31Hrabal R. Chen Z. James S. Bennett H.P. Ni F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Comparison of the biosynthetic origin of granulin peptides in various mammals reveals that all are commonly derived from a precursor composed of one amino-terminal half (p) followed by seven (A-G) nonidentical copies of the granulin motif (32He Z. Bateman A. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). GEP is abundantly expressed in rapidly cycling epithelial cells, in cells of the immune system, and in neurons (30Lu R. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The role of GEP in the regulation of cellular proliferation has been well characterized using mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from mice with a targeted deletion of the insulin-like growth factor receptor gene (R- cells). These cells are unable to proliferate in response to insulin-like growth factor and other growth factors (EGF and platelet-derived growth factor) necessary to fully progress through the cell cycle (42Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In contrast, GEP is the only known growth factor able to bypass the requirement for the insulin-like growth factor receptor, thus promoting growth of R- cells (29Zanocco-Marani T. Bateman A.

Increasing evidence has also implicated GEP in the regulation of differentiation, development, and pathological processes. It has been isolated as a differentially expressed gene from mesothelial differentiation (44Sun X. Gulyas M. Hjerpe A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), sexual differentiation of the brain (45Suzuki M. Nishiahara M. Mol. Genet.

Remarkably, GEP was also shown to be a crucial mediator of wound response and tissue repair (38He Z. Ong C.H. Halper J. Bateman A. Nat.

The aim of this study is to characterize the interaction between GEP and COMP and to investigate the biological significance of this interaction in regulating chondrocyte proliferation. Yeast expression vectors pDBleu and pPC86 (both from Invitrogen) are fusion vectors for the linkage of proteins to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and to the VP16 transactivation domain, respectively. The fragments encoding the four functional domains (i.e. the N-terminal domain (aa 20-83), EGF repeat domain (aa 84-261), type III repeat domain (aa 266-520), and C-terminal domain (aa 521-755; GenBank™ accession number AF257516)) of mouse COMP were amplified by PCR and cloned in frame into the SalI/NotI sites of pDBleu (pDB-COMP-NT, pDB-COMP-epidermal growth factor, pDB-COMP-type III, and pDB-COMP-CT) to serve as bait in the screening assay. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-3X (Invitrogen) was used to produce recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The cDNA fragments encoding the four functional domains (i.e. the N-terminal (aa 20-83), EGF repeat domain (aa 84-261), type III repeat domain (aa 266-520), and C-terminal (aa 521-755; Gen-Bank™ accession number AF257516)) of mouse COMP were inserted in frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X to generate the plasmids pGEX-N-term, pGEX-EGF, pGEX-type III, and pGEX-C-term, respectively. The bacterial expression pBAD TOPO vector (Invitrogen) was used to produce His-tagged proteins in E. coli. cDNA inserts encoding different fragments (Table 1) of GEP (GenBank™ accession number NM_017113.1) were subcloned into the pBAD TOPO vector per the manufacturer's instructions to generate the indicated plasmids.TABLE 1Fragments of rat GEP cloned into pBAD TOPO vectorFragmentPlasmidGranulin A (aa 278-333)pGEP-(278-333)Granuliln C (aa 361-413)pGEP-(361-413)Granulin D (aa 438-492)pGEP-(438-492)Granulin E (aa 512-567)pGEP-(512-567)Granulin ACDE (aa 278-588)pGEP-(278-588)GEP (aa 1-588)pGEP-(1-588) Open table in a new tab The mammalian expression pEGFP-GEP construct was kindly provided by Dr. Mathews at University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The mammalian expression pDsRed1-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) was used to produce recombinant protein. A cDNA fragment encoding mouse full-length COMP was amplified by PCR and subcloned in frame into the EcoRI/KpnI sites of pDsRed1-N1 to produce plasmid pDsRed1-N1-COMP, which expresses RED fusion proteins in the mammalian cell line. All constructs were verified by nucleic acid sequencing; subsequent analysis was performed using BLAST software (available on the World Wide Web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). Rat chondrosarcoma cells (RCS cell) were cultured in tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. RCS cells were cultured for 1 day before transfection using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions, at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/30-mm plate. The plasmid pEGFP-GEP, pDsRed1-N1-COMP, and pEGFP-GEP plus pDsRed1-N1-COMP or the empty pEGFP vector were transfected into RCS cells to generate RCS-GEP, RCS-COMP, RCS-GEP plus COMP, and RCS-control cell line. Two days after transfection, cells were divided into 100-mm dishes at a density of 105 cells/dish in 10 ml of DMEM containing 1,000 μg/ml of G418. After 14 days in selective medium (medium changed every 3 days), cells were expanded in DMEM containing 500 μg/ml G418. For expression of GST fusion proteins, the appropriate plasmid pGEX-N-term, pGEX-EGF, pGEX-typeIII, or pGEX-C-term was transformed into E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen). Fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads, as described previously (49Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). His-GrnA, His-GrnC, His-GrnD, His-GrnE, His-GrnACDE, and His-GEP were purified by affinity chromatography using a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, bacteria lysates supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 0.5 m NaCl were applied to the HiTrap chelating column; the column was washed with HSB buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, and 0.05% Brij 35) containing 10 mm imidazole; and the His-GrnA, His-GrnC, His-GrnD, His-GrnE, and His-GrnACDE were eluted with HSB buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Plasmid pDB-COMP-epidermal growth factor (see above) was used as bait to screen the Y2H rat brain cDNA library (Invitrogen) according to a modified manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, bait plasmid was introduced into a yeast MAV203 strain that contained three reporter genes, HIS+, URA+, and lacZ (Invitrogen), and transformants were selected on defined medium lacking leucine. The rat brain cDNA library in the vector pPC86 was then transformed into the resultant Leu+ yeast strain and plated on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and uracil but containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-trizone that can specifically inhibit the activity of HIS3 gene product and block the basal concentration of HIS3 in yeast (SD-leu-/trp-/his-/ura-/3AT+). After incubation for 7-10 days at 30 °C, colonies were screened for β-galactosidase by a filter lift assay (24Hecht J.T. Nelson L.D. Crowder E. Wang Y. Elder F.F. Harrison W.R. Francomano C.A. Prange C.K. Lennon G.G. Deere M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Individual pPC86 recombinant plasmids that were identified in the initial screen were further verified for interaction with bait by repeating the Y2H assay. Three independent colonies were analyzed for interaction in yeast of two proteins, one of which was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the other to the VP16 transactivation domain. The procedures of Vojtek et al. (50Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) and Hollenberg et al. (51Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) were followed for 1) growing and transforming the yeast strain MAV203 with the selected plasmids and 2) β-galactosidase activity and growth phenotypes on growth phenotypes on selective SD-leu-/trp-/his-/ura-/3AT+ plates. For examination of the binding of COMP to GEP in vitro, glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl) preincubated with either purified GST (0.5 μg, serving as control) or GST-EGF-like domain of COMP and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose preincubated with either His or His-tagged GEP were incubated with purified His-tagged Grn-ACDE or COMP (purified from HEK293 cells stably transfected with an expression plasmid encoding full-length human COMP), respectively. Bound proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with anti-His antibodies and polyclonal rabbit anti-COMP antiserum. In the case of the binding assay for dissecting the repeat unit of GEP required for interaction with COMP, glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl) preincubated with either purified GST (0.5 μg, serving as control) or the GST-EGF domain of COMP were incubated with purified His-tagged Grn-ACDE, GrnA, GrnC, GrnD, or GrnE, respectively. Bound proteins were processed as described above. Approximately 500 μg of cell extracts prepared from isolated human chondrocytes were incubated with anti-GEP (25 μg/ml, acrogranulin, N-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or control rabbit IgG (25 μg/ml) antibodies for 1 h, followed by incubation with 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. After washing five times with immunoprecipitation buffer, bound proteins were released by boiling in 20 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer for 3 min (52Liu C.J. Ding B. Wang H. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Released proteins were examined by Western blotting with anti-COMP antibodies (3Di Cesare P.E. Fang C. Leslie M.P. Tulli H.

Ectopic Expression of Fluorescent GEP and COMP in Living Cells—To examine whether co-expressed GEP and COMP colocalize in the living cells, GFP-linked GEP and red fluorescent protein-fused COMP were co-transfected into RCS chondrocytes, and 48 h later the culture was directly observed under a fluorescence microscope with appropriate optical filters. Microscopic images were captured using the Image Pro program (Media Cybernetics) and an Olympus microscope. Images were arranged using the Adobe Photoshop program. Immunostaining for COMP and GEP in Primary Human Chondrocytes—Cultures of isolated human chondrocytes were plated on glass coverslips coated with polylysine and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After reaching 80% confluence, the cells were fixed with cold acetone/methanol (1:1) for 20 min and air-dried. After rehydration in phosphate-buffered saline and blocking with 20% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies (i.e. mouse monoclonal anti-COMP antibodies (diluted 1:50) and polyclonal goat anti-GEP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:50) at room temperature for 1 h. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were incubated with secondary antibodies (i.e. goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with rhodamine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:100) and chick anti-goat IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:400) for 50 min. The specimens were observed, and the images were processed as described above. 4-μm-thick formalin-fixed paraffin sections of 19-day-old embryonic murine limbs were immunostained for GEP. The sections were pretreated with chondroitinase (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by protein block (Dako serum-free protein block) for 10 min at room temperature to reduce nonspecific staining. Polyclonal goat anti-human GEP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted at 1:200 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Binding of primary antibodies was detected using biotinylated anti-goat secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) diluted at 1:800 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C followed by alkaline phosphatase (Vector) at 37 °C for 30 min and developed with Vector Red (Vector) for 2 min at room temperature. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Dako). The primary antibody was substituted with Negative Control SuperSensitive goat serum (BioGenex) for the negative control section. In the case of the assay for examining the COMP expression, the same tissue was used, and the same protocol was followed, except the anti-GEP was replaced by anti-COMP antibody, and the sections were not pretreated with chondroitinase. 1.0 × 105 of stable transfected RCS-control (GFP vector, serving as control), RCS-COMP, RCS-GEP, and RCS-COMP plus GEP cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics in 6-well dishes, and the viable cells were counted every day until day 5. Each group was repeated three times. In the case of the antibody-blocking experiment, we first generated affinity-purified anti-COMP antibodies in order to study the dosage response in a controlled condition. Briefly, the anti-COMP serum (3Di Cesare P.E. Fang C. Leslie M.P. Tulli H. Perris R. Carlson C.S. J. Orthop. Res. 2000; 18: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 53Di Cesare P.E. Fang C.

The bound antibodies were eluted from the beads with 0.15 m glycine buffer (pH 2.5) and immediately neutralized with 1.5 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) (56Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J.

Then various does of the purified anti-COMP (2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 μg/ml) or the control antibody (10.0 μg/ml) were added into the cultures of the 6.0 × 104 RCS cells transfected with a plasmid encoding GEP in 24-well plates, and the cell proliferation was assayed as above. Isolation of GEP as a COMP Binding Partner—To better understand the biological functions of COMP, we performed a Y2H screen. Briefly, we linked the four functional domains of COMP (the N-terminal pentamerizing domain (aa 20-83), the EGF-like domain (aa 84-261), type 3 repeats (aa 266-520), and the C-terminal (aa 521-755)) to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the plasmid pDBleu. We used the respective constructs as bait to screen a library of rat brain cDNA expressed as fusion proteins to the VP16 acidic activation domain in the vector pPC86. A Y2H rat cDNA library was screened with the construct encoding the EGF-like repeats of COMP. We screened ∼2.5 million clones and identified 21 that activated the three reporter genes. Further tests involved the retransformation of yeast with the purified target plasmids and bait. Only 12 of the original 21 y"

Previous studies showed that treatment of MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells with the potent protein kinase C (PKC) agonist, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), induces a transient drop in sphingomyelin concomitant with an increase in cellular ceramide levels (Becker, K. P., Kitatani, K., Idkowiak-Baldys, J., Bielawski, J., and Hannun, Y. A. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 2606-2612). Here we show that PMA selectively activates ASMase and that ASMase accounts for the majority of PMA-induced ceramide. Pharmacologic inhibition and RNA interference experiments indicated that the novel PKC, PKCδ, is required for ASMase activation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed the formation of a novel PKCδ-ASMase complex after PMA stimulation, and PKCδ was able to phosphorylate ASMase in vitro and in cells. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identify serine 508 as the key residue phosphorylated in response to PMA. Phosphorylation of Ser508 proved to be an indispensable step for ASMase activation and membrane translocation in response to PMA. The relevance of the proposed mechanism of ASMase regulation is further validated in a model of UV radiation. UV radiation also induced phosphorylation of ASMase at serine 508. Moreover, when transiently overexpressed, ASMaseS508A blocked the ceramide formation after PMA treatment, suggesting a dominant negative function for this mutant. Taken together, these results establish a novel direct biochemical mechanism for ASMase activation in which PKCδ serves as a key upstream kinase.

In contrast to the multistep de novo pathway of ceramide biosynthesis, breakdown of SM is catalyzed by a single class of enzymes, the sphingomyelinases (SMases). Currently, the NCBI data base contains five entries for human SMases that are grouped according to their optimal pH as acid (ASMase or SMPD1), neutral (NMase or SMPD2, -3, and -4), and alkaline sphingomyelinases (Alk-SMase or ENPP7). Acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) was the first SMase to be purified and cloned (2Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yamaguchi S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3805-3813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Quintern L.E. Weitz G. Nehrkorn H. Tager J.M. Schram A.W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although encoded by the same gene and mRNA, two forms of the enzyme have been described: an endolysosomal form (or Zn2+-independent form) and a secretory form (or Zn2+-dependent form) (5Schissel S.L. Keesler G.A. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18250-18259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Post-translational protein glycosylation plays an important role in both trafficking and stability of ASMase within the lysosomal milieu (6Newrzella D. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32089-32095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Moczall H. Lansmann S. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, cysteine 629 situated toward the C terminus of ASMase has been proposed as an important residue for regulation of the enzyme such that modification (mutation or deletion) of this residue results in 5-fold activation of the enzyme (8Qiu H. Edmunds T. Baker-Malcolm J. Karey K.P. Estes S. Schwarz C. Hughes H. Van Patten S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32744-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In humans, mutation of the SMPD1 gene results in Niemann-Pick disease, an autosomal recessive neurovisceral disease of high lethality. The severity of the Niemann-Pick disease phenotype correlates well with the deficiency in the in vitro ASMase activity, which has become a standard test for classification of patients with the disease. Indeed, the knock-out mouse in the SMPD1 gene recapitulates the Niemann-Pick disease phenotype as described by multiple investigators (9Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L.

Pract. 1997; 193: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Biologically, ASMase has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathophysiologic processes (reviewed in Refs. 11Andrieu-Abadie N. Levade T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Ferlinz K. Linke T. Bartelsen O. Weiler M. Sandhoff K. Chem. Phys.

Hannun Y.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In particular, ASMase has been shown to be activated in response to various stress stimuli including 1) ligation of death receptors (tumor necrosis factor-α, CD95, and TRAIL), 2) radiation (UV-C and ionizing radiation), 3) chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and histone deacetylase inhibitors), 4) viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens (rhinoviruses, Neisseria gonorrhea, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Cryptosporidium parvum), and 5) cytokines (e.g. IL-1β). Evidence from studies conducted in cell culture and animal models suggested that activation of ASMase by the above agents is a key step during cellular differentiation, growth arrest, apoptosis, and immune defense mechanisms. Although most of these studies describe rapid activation of the enzyme (most likely via a post-translational modification), transcriptional change is yet another regulator of ASMase activity. For instance, differentiation of monocytic cells to macrophages requires up-regulation of the enzyme at a transcriptional level (15Langmann T. Buechler C. Ries S. Schaeffler A. Aslanidis C. Schuierer M. Weiler M. Sandhoff K. de Jong P.J. Schmitz G. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 870-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription factors SP1 and AP-2 mediate the ASMase response during monocytic differentiation. Later studies demonstrated that AP-2 also up-regulates ASMase in leukemia cells treated with retinoic acid (16Murate T. Suzuki M. Hattori M. Takagi A. Kojima T. Tanizawa T. Asano H. Hotta T. Saito H. Yoshida S. Tamiya-Koizumi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9936-9943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, ASMase was implicated in maintenance of calcium homeostasis in mouse and cell culture models (17Ginzburg L. Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1619-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Church L.D. Hessler G. Goodall J.E. Rider D.A. Workman C.J. Vignali D.A. Bacon P.A. Gulbins E. Young S.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 78: 266-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In particular, cerebellar deficits in the Niemann-Pick mouse were reported to be associated with defects in the calcium transport machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, although the scientific literature is replete with reports implicating ASMase in various cellular responses, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of ASMase regulation remain unclear. Interestingly, recent studies suggest regulation of ASMase by redox mechanisms. For instance, the death ligand TRAIL signals ASMase activation through reactive oxygen species production (19Dumitru C.A. Gulbins E. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5612-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms proposed to regulate ASMase enzymatic activity include interaction with lysosomal anionic lipids (bismonoacylglycerophosphate) and sphingolipid activator protein SAP-C (20Linke T. Wilkening G. Lansmann S. Moczall H. Bartelsen O. Weisgerber J. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the proximal mechanisms involved in direct regulation of ASMase remain undefined. In a previous study, we identified a novel mechanism of regulation of ceramide formation by protein kinase C (PKC) through activation of the salvage pathway (1Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2606-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this model, treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with PMA, a potent PKC agonist, resulted in a significant increase in cellular ceramide concomitant with a drop in sphingomyelin levels. Interestingly, this response was blocked upon treatment with the ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1, but not an inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, myriocin, thus ruling out involvement of the de novo pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that phorbol esters induce activation of ASMase through PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, it is shown that PMA induces phosphorylation of ASMase at Ser508, and this phosphorylation is indispensable for activation of the enzyme. Moreover, this phosphorylation event appears to be required for translocation of ASMase to the plasma membrane. The significance of Ser508 phosphorylation and the role of PKCδ-ASMase association are further confirmed in the context of agonist-driven ASMase activation induced by UV radiation. Materials—Cell culture material, including RPMI medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), phosphate-free medium, and dialyzed serum, were from Invitrogen. Bovine sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, and diacylglycerol were from Avanti polar lipids (Alabaster, AL). [choline-methyl-14C]Sphingomyelin was kindly provided by Dr. Alicja Bielawska (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Antibodies against PKCδ (polyclonal) and LAMP-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against the V5 epitope and GFP were from Invitrogen. Anti-phosphoserine (polyclonal) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Purified ASMase was a kind gift from Dr. Gary Smith (Glaxosmithkline). The PKC antibody sampler kit was purchased from BD Biosciences. The endoglycosidase H digestion kit and all other materials were from Sigma. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—MCF-7 cells were originally purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Where indicated, cells were shifted to a phosphate-free medium. Testing for the presence of mycoplasma infections was performed routinely on a monthly basis. UV Irradiation—MCF-7 cells grown on 10-cm dishes were coated with a thin layer of phosphate-buffered saline prior to irradiation. Radiation was performed using a GS Gene Linker UV chamber (Bio-Rad), which emits UV-C light (λavg = 254 nm) at a dose of 50 J/m2. Cells were then reincubated with RPMI medium and then collected for analysis at the indicated time(s) postirradiation. ASMase Peptide and Antiserum Production—Development of ASMase antiserum was conducted at the Sigma Genosys facility. The ASMase peptide sequence was analyzed using the PCGENE program. The program selects regions of a protein that are candidates for raising antibodies, based on antigenicity, flexibility, and β-turn. Based on this analysis, the following peptide sequence was chosen and synthesized: CVGELQAAEDRGDKV (15 mer, residues 361-374). This sequence received the following scores: antigenicity = 2.5; flexibility = 1.064; β-turn = 2.4. The peptide was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin before immunization of two rabbits. The third bleed was affinity-purified, and specificity of the antibody was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations of the serine residues of ASMase were performed by PCR cloning using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for the S to A mutation were as follows: S149A, 5′-AGGTGTGGAGACGCGCAGTGCTGAG-3′; S231A, 5′-TGCCGCCGGGGTGCTGGCCTGCCGC-3′; S248A, 5′-CTGGGGCGAATACGCCAAGTGTGACCTGC-3′; S508A, 5′-TACTCCAGGAGCGCTCACGTGGTCC-3′; S508E, 5′-TACTCCAGGAGCGAACACGTGGTCC-3′. All transformants were sequenced to verify the integrity of mutations. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Transfections were performed according to standard protocols using Effectene (Qiagen). After 24 h, cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1.75 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm microcystin. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation of ASMase via a monoclonal V5 antibody (1 μg/ml). Western blot analysis was carried using similar procedures as described previously (21Zeidan Y.H. Pettus B.J. Elojeimy S. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Kawamori T. Norris J.S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24695-24703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SMase Assays—In vitro enzymatic assays for acid and neutral sphingomyelinases were performed using [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin. The assays were performed as previously reported (21Zeidan Y.H. Pettus B.J. Elojeimy S. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Kawamori T. Norris J.S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24695-24703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Marchesini N.

RNA Interference—Gene silencing of human ASMase and PKCδ was performed essentially according to a standard protocol (21Zeidan Y.H. Pettus B.J. Elojeimy S. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Kawamori T. Norris J.S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24695-24703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific small interfering RNA reagents were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The sequences of the sense and antisense small interfering RNAs are shown in Table 1. The specificity of the RNAi was verified by sequence comparison with the human genome data base using the NIH Blast program.TABLE 1RNAi target sequences for specific protein knockdownTarget proteinRNAi target sequence (21 bases)hASMase (sequence1)AAC TCC TTT GGA TGG GCC TGGhASMase (sequence2)AAG GTT ACA TCG CAT AGT GCCPKCδAAC GAC AAG ATC ATC GGC AGA Open table in a new tab In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro phosphorylation reactions were performed as follows: 6 μg of purified ASMase were incubated with 25 ng of recombinant PKCδ (Calbiochem) at 30 °C in a kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP), 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and where indicated, the buffer was supplemented with lipid-detergent mixed micelles consisting of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 10 μg/ml diacylglycerol sonicated in 0.3% Triton X-100 solution. At the indicated time points, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and then the gels were dried. ASMase phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. In Vivo Labeling of ASMase—MCF-7 cells plated in 10-cm dishes (250 × 103 cells/plate) were transiently transfected with V5-ASMase. Cells were incubated in phosphate-free RPMI medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS for 1 h. Then cells were shifted to the labeling medium containing 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate and incubated for an additional 4 h. Treatment with either PMA or Me2SO was performed in phosphate-free medium for 1 h. ASMase was immunoprecipitated via the V5 epitope and loaded on SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 32P into ASMase was detected by autoradiography after gel drying. Confocal Microscopy—Approximately 5 × 105 cells were seeded to a 2-cm poly-l-lysine-coated confocal plate (MatTek Corp.). After treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with methanol for 5 min. Blocking was performed in 2.5% FBS solution. Primary antibodies were diluted in a solution of 1.5% FBS, 0.15% saponin and incubated for 3 h. The samples were then washed with 1.5% FBS solution three times. This was followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were stored at 4 °C until image acquisition. Images were acquired using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510). Excitation wavelengths 488, 543, and 633 were used. Images were acquired at the equatorial plane of monolayer cells guided by DRAQ5 (Alexis) nuclear stain. For in vivo imaging, cells were fitted in a special chamber under controlled temperature and CO2 settings. Mass Spectroscopy for Ceramide and Sphingomyelin—Sphingolipid analysis was performed using electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction-monitoring positive ionization mode. This method has been recently described (23Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; 39: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs and Overexpression—Original ASMase cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Ed Schuchman (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). The cDNA (2.37 kb) encoding human ASMase was excised from the original PSVK3 plasmid using EcoRI and EcoRV restriction enzymes. After amplification by conventional PCR, the cDNA was ligated into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The V5 epitope is situated at the carboxyl terminus of ASMase. Complementary DNA for PKCδ was ligated into pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech). The restriction sites used were XhoI and KpnI. The GFP epitope is situated at the amino terminus of PKCδ. The integrity of the new plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. For transient overexpression experiments, endotoxin-free plasmids were transfected into MCF-7 cells using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Real Time PCR Analysis (Reverse Transcription-PCR/Quantitative PCR)—DNA-free messenger RNA from MCF-7 cells was isolated using the Qiagen minikit for mRNA extraction. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using the reverse transcriptase kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed on an iCycler system from Bio-Rad. The sample real time reverse transcription-PCR reaction volume was 25 μl, including 12.5 μl of SYBR Green PCR reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 7.5 μl of cDNA template, and 5 μl of the diluted forward and reverse primers (3 μm). First steps of reverse transcription-PCR were 2 min at 50 °C followed by a 10-min hold at 95 °C. Cycles (n = 40) consisted of a 15-s melt at 95 °C, followed by a 1-min annealing/extension at 60 °C. The final step was a 60 °C incubation for 1 min. Reactions were performed in triplicate. The threshold for cycle of threshold (Ct) analysis of all samples was set at 0.15 relative fluorescence units. The data were normalized to levels of an internal control gene, β-actin. The reverse transcription primers used in this study were as follows: β-actin (forward, 5′-ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTAGTTTCGTGGATGCCACA-3′) and ASMase (forward, 5′-TGGCTCTATGAAGCGATGGC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGAGAGAGATGAGGCGGAGAC). Deglycosylation with Endoglycosidase H—Treatment of immunoprecipitated ASMase with endoglycosidase H (Sigma) was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, samples were boiled in denaturation buffer containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% SDS for 5 min. Samples were cooled on ice for another 5 min. Then endoglycosidase was added (0.01 units/sample), and the reaction was carried at 37 °C for 12 h in a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5. Statistical Analysis—Mann-Whitney or Student's t tests were performed between control and treated states and/or between treatment and treatment plus RNAi-mediated inhibition states in a minimum of three independent experiments. A p value of 0.05 or less is considered as statistically significant and marked in the figures with an asterisk. PMA Induces Activation and Membrane Translocation of ASMase—Previously, we reported that PMA treatment induces an elevation in ceramide levels that persisted after blocking the de novo pathway with myriocin but was inhibited by fumonisin B1, suggesting operation of the salvage pathway (resynthesis of ceramide from sphingosine derived from the breakdown of complex sphingolipids but not from de novo synthesis) (1Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2606-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The concomitant drop in sphingomyelin levels induced by PMA treatment, therefore, prompted us to investigate the potential involvement of SMases. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of MCF-7 cells with 100 nm PMA resulted in transient activation of ASMase, with the maximum in vitro activity detected after 60 min (Fig. 1A). Since diacylglycerol has been suggested to activate ASMase directly (24Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16759-16762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of direct addition of PMA into the enzyme reaction buffer (post-cell lysis) was evaluated; however, PMA failed to activate ASMase directly (data not shown), suggesting that the stimulation process was indirect. Moreover, no change in total cellular neutral SMase activity was detected within 60 min of PMA treatment (Fig. 1A). Next, we examined whether activation of ASMase was associated with a change in its subcellular localization. For these studies, a novel polyclonal antibody that recognizes ASMase was employed. After affinity purification of third bleed serum, the specificity of the antibody was tested. Western blot analysis of liver homogenates derived from WT and ASMase-/- mice revealed that the new antibody detected the 72-kDa form of ASMase (supplemental Fig. 1A). Moreover, the antibody proved useful for immunofluorescence applications, as indicated by colocalization of its signal with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) (supplemental Fig. 1B). As expected, under basal conditions, most of cellular ASMase was concentrated within acidic compartments, as evidenced by colocalization with the acidophilic dye lysotracker red. There was no change in ASMase staining acutely after PMA treatment (5 min). However, confocal microscopy imaging revealed translocation of ASMase from endolysosomes to the plasma membrane after sustained PMA treatment (100 nm, 60 min) (Fig. 1B). Therefore, these data demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of PMA on ASMase is associated with relocation of the enzyme to the plasma membrane. Requirement for ASMase in PMA-induced Ceramide Formation—The contribution of ASMase to the observed accumulation of ceramide following PMA treatment was consequently investigated. Although tricyclic amines (and other closely related compounds) have been routinely used to block ASMase, our recent data showed that the action of these compounds is not restricted to ASMase (21Zeidan Y.H. Pettus B.J. Elojeimy S. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Kawamori T. Norris J.S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24695-24703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, knockdown of ASMase was attempted using two different RNAi sequences. Real time PCR analysis was employed to analyze levels of ASMase mRNA (with β-actin as internal control) 48 h after transfection of two different RNAi sequences. As shown in Fig. 2A, successful knockdown of ASMase mRNA was achieved with one of the two RNAi sequences (sequence 1) at a concentration as low as 5 nm. Knockdown of ASMase was further confirmed by in vitro ASMase enzymatic assay. Transfection of sequence 1 (5 nm) resulted in about 70% reduction in total ASMase activity observed at 48 and 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 2B). Therefore, cells were transfected with either scrambled (SCR) or ASMase RNAi (5 nm for 48 h) prior to treatment with PMA. Mass spectrometric analysis showed a doubling in total cellular ceramide levels in response to PMA in cells pretreated with SCR sequence. This response was significantly blocked in cells where ASMase was knocked down (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results suggest that ASMase is required for PMA-induced ceramide formation in the salvage pathway. Role of PKCδ in Activation of ASMase—Phorbol esters signal primarily through proteins with C1 domains, of which the classical and novel PKCs are the most studied. Therefore, to investigate the possible involvement of PKCs in ASMase activation, a panel of pharmacologic inhibitors that block different classes of PKCs was employed. In vitro SMase assays showed that pretreatment with either bisindoleilamide, an inhibitor of classical and novel PKCs, or rottlerin, an inhibitor of novel PKCδ, blocked the ASMase activation in response to PMA. However, the classical PKC inhibitor GÖ 6976 did not significantly affect ASMase activity (Fig. 3A). Based on the above results and on published studies on the role of PKCδ in mediating stress responses, we hypothesized that the novel PKCδ may mediate activation of ASMase. RNAi knockdown of PKCδ was therefore employed. Transfection of a specific PKCδ RNAi sequence (Table 1) at a dose of 5 nm for 48 h resulted in substantial down-regulation of PKCδ at the protein level without influencing total cellular levels of other detected PKC isoforms (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, knockdown of PKCδ blocked activation of ASMase after PMA treatment but had no effect on basal enzymatic activity (Fig. 3C). In further support of these results, mass spectrometric analysis revealed a proportional drop in ceramide levels after PKCδ knockdown (Fig. 3D). Additionally, knockdown of PKCδ blocked the PMA-induced ASMase translocation to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3E). Therefore, these results indicate that PKCδ lies upstream of ASMase activation. Early Translocation of PKCδ to the Plasma Membrane Followed by Partial Localization to the Lysosome—Similar to most other members of the PKC family, translocation of PKCδ from the cytosol to the plasma membrane is a hallmark of its activation. However, it is worth mentioning that additional sites of PKCδ translocation have been recently reported, including mitochondria (25Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell.

It is a metabolically versatile bacterium able to respond to changes in oxygen availability. This ability is a crucial component of its lifestyle, allowing it to thrive in aerobic external environments and under the oxygen-starved conditions of a host gut. The controlled growth conditions of chemostat culture were combined with transcript profiling to investigate transcriptome dynamics during the transition from aerobic to micro-aerobic conditions. In addition to predictable changes in transcripts encoding proteins of central metabolism, the abundances of transcripts involved in homeostasis of redox-reactive metals (Cu and Fe), and cell envelope stress were significantly altered. To gain further insight into the responses of the regulatory networks, the activities of key transcription factors during the transition to micro-aerobic conditions were inferred using a probabilistic modeling approach, which revealed that the response of the direct oxygen sensor FNR was rapid and overshot, whereas the indirect oxygen sensor ArcA reacted more slowly. Similarly, the cell envelope stress sensors RpoE and CpxR reacted rapidly and more slowly, respectively. Thus, it is suggested that combining rapid and slow reacting components in regulatory networks might be a feature of systems in which a signal is perceived by two or more functionally related transcription factors controlling overlapping regulons.

Escherichia coli is a metabolically versatile bacterium that is able to grow in the presence and absence of oxygen. To achieve this, it exploits a flexible biochemistry in which aerobic respiration is preferred to anaerobic respiration, which in turn is preferred to fermentation. The preference for aerobic respiration reflects the relative energetic efficiencies of the alternative metabolic modes (1Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.A. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes & Co., Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). To exploit the energetic benefits conferred by aerobic respiration, E. coli has two alternative quinol oxidases, cytochrome bo3 and cytochrome bd (2Gennis R.B. Stewart V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coliSalmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 217-261Google Scholar). Cytochrome bo3 is a heme-copper protein that is synthesized under aerobic conditions and has a lower affinity for O2 than the heme protein cytochrome bd, which has a very high affinity for O2 and is synthesized under micro-aerobic conditions (3D'mello R. Hill S. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Cotter P.A. Melville S.B. Albrecht J.A. Gunsalus R.P. Mol.

In a further adaptation to lower O2 concentrations, the role of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), 2The abbreviations used are: PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PFL, pyruvate formate-lyase; Arc, aerobic respiratory control; cfu, colony forming unit; FNR, regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. 2The abbreviations used are: PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PFL, pyruvate formate-lyase; Arc, aerobic respiratory control; cfu, colony forming unit; FNR, regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. which oxidizes pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2, is progressively taken over by pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL), which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and formate (1Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.A. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes & Co., Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). These adaptations allow the bacteria to exploit the relatively low levels of O2 present under micro-aerobic conditions and maintain redox balance. Adaptation to changes in O2 availability is regulated at the level of transcription by two well characterized systems, FNR and ArcBA (6Kang Y. Weber K.D. Qiu Y. Kiley P.J. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1135-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Constantinidou C. Hobman J.L. Griffiths L. Patel M.D. Penn C.W. Cole J.A. Overton T.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 15084-15096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). FNR is a direct O2 sensor (10Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), whereas the ArcBA two-component system senses O2 availability indirectly by monitoring the redox state of the quinone pool (11Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. Science. 2001; 292: 2314-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). FNR and ArcBA cooperate to regulate some operons, such as cydAB (encoding cytochrome bd) and focA-pflB (encoding PFL) (5Govantes F. Orjalo A.V. Gunsalus R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions expression of cydAB is minimal, but as O2 availability decreases, ArcA binds at the cydAB promoter to facilitate maximal expression under micro-aerobic conditions (5Govantes F. Orjalo A.V. Gunsalus R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As O2 availability decreases further, FNR binds the cydAB promoter to repress expression (5Govantes F. Orjalo A.V. Gunsalus R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similarly, under aerobic conditions expression of pflB is minimal, but as O2 availability decreases, ArcA and FNR bind to the focA-pflB promoter region to activate expression (12Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcriptional outputs are dependent on the relative amounts of active transcription factors (in these cases FNR and ArcA) and their regulatory strengths. It is difficult to determine regulatory activities of transcription factors experimentally, but they can be inferred using models where information on network connectivity and time-resolved transcript profiling is available. Such models promise to provide new insight into the responses of regulatory networks in changing environments (13Sanguinetti G. Lawrence N.D. Rattray M. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 2775-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the present work, changes in the E. coli transcriptome were monitored as aerobic chemostat cultures adapted to micro-aerobic conditions. It is shown that, as well as predictable changes in transcripts encoding proteins involved in central metabolic processes, the bacteria respond to changes in metal ion physiology and to cell envelope stress during the transition to micro-aerobic growth. Modeling transcriptome dynamics revealed that the responses to lower O2 availability and cell envelope stress involved fast and slow reacting components. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Strains of E. coli and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2. It should be noted that E. coli strains do not necessarily respond identically to environmental changes because of differences in their genetic make up. Therefore, in all cases, comparisons were made using the appropriate parent and mutant combinations (supplemental Table S2). E. coli strain MG1655 was used for the transcript profiling experiments. Chemostat cultures were grown in New Brunswick Scientific Bioflow 1000 fermentation vessels (1.8 liters capacity) with culture agitation speed constant at 300 rpm, and the temperature maintained at 37 °C. Oxygen levels were monitored, and the pH was maintained at 7.2 ± 0.2. Evans-defined growth medium (14Evans C.G.T. Herbert D. Tempest D.W. Methods Microbiol. 1970; 2: 277-327Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar) was used with glucose (15 mm) as the carbon source. Steady state cultures were established at a dilution rate of 0.2 h-1. Fully aerobic conditions were maintained by sparging the cultures with air (0.4 liters min-1). The switch to micro-aerobic conditions was achieved by switching off the air sparging the culture. For competitive index experiments approximately equal numbers of parent (W3110) and yfiD (JRG4403; 15) strains were mixed and used to inoculate (1:100) 10 ml of Evansdefined medium (14Evans C.G.T. Herbert D. Tempest D.W. Methods Microbiol. 1970; 2: 277-327Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar) with glucose (30 mm) as the carbon source. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C under 20, 7, or 0% O2 atmospheres for 16 h. The number of colony forming units (cfu) on L agar and L agar containing kanamycin (30 mg l-1) were then measured. Competitive index (CI) values were calculated as follows: mutantanaerobic/parentanaerobic: mutantaerobic/parentaerobic and mutantmicroaerobic/parentmicroaerobic: mutantaerobic/parentaerobic. The effects of mutations in key regulators on gene expression were determined using promoter-lacZ fusions (16Sambrook J.W. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) of cultures grown under the indicated conditions in L broth (17Lennox E.S. Virology. 1955; 1: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) according to Miller (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Oxygen transfer to cultures was measured as described (19Wainwright L.M. Elvers K.T. Park S.F. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 4079-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the ompW mutant was investigated using Biolog phenotype microarrays (Biolog, Hayward CA). Transcript Profiling—Transcript profiling and data analysis were as described by Partridge et al. (20Partridge J.D. Scott C. Tang Y. Poole R.K. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27806-27815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly culture samples (10 ml) were flushed from the chemostat directly into RNA Protect (Qiagen) before total RNA purification using a RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen). Equal quantities of RNA from control (aerobic steady state) and experimental (5, 10, 15, and 60 min lowered exposure to air) cultures were labeled using Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP. For each E. coli K12 OciChip (Ocimum Biosolutions, product number 2140-000000), dye swap experiments were done for each pairing with two biological replicates (separate chemostat runs). Data were analyzed using Imagene, version 5.1 and Genesight version 4 (Biodiscovery Inc) as previously described (20Partridge J.D. Scott C. Tang Y. Poole R.K. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27806-27815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Genes showing greater than 2-fold changes in transcript abundance at one or more time points with a p value of ≤0.05 (as determined by a Student's t test) were deemed to be differentially regulated. Real Time PCR—Reactions and control samples (using the gene-specific primers listed in supplemental Table S2) were assembled and analyzed as previously described (20Partridge J.D. Scott C. Tang Y. Poole R.K. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27806-27815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transcript Mapping by 5′-RACE PCR—RNA was isolated from anaerobic cultures using Qiagen RNeasy mini kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ompW and ftnB transcript starts were identified using 2 μg of E. coli RNA per RACE reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) with the oligonucleotides listed in supplemental Table S2. Modeling Transcription Factor Activities—The response of the regulatory network during the transition from aerobic to micro-aerobic conditions was analyzed using a probabilistic model (13Sanguinetti G. Lawrence N.D. Rattray M. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 2775-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The model adopts a log-linear approximation to the kinetics of the regulatory system where the transcription profiles are modeled as sparse linear combinations of the transcription factor activity profiles. Assumptions are incorporated as prior probability distributions on the active transcription factor profiles and the gene-specific intensity with which they regulate their targets. These are, essentially, a continuity assumption on the activity profiles (encapsulated in the Markov chain structure of the prior distribution) and equal prior probability of repression and activation. The sparsity of the model is provided by the structure of the regulatory network. The gene expression data is used to infer transcription factor activity profiles and the gene specific regulatory intensities using Bayes' theorem. A more detailed description is provided under supplemental materials. Global Transcriptional Responses during the Transition from Aerobic to Micro-aerobic Conditions—Previously we have combined chemostats with transcript profiling to investigate the dynamics of gene regulation in E. coli during the transition from anaerobic to aerobic growth (20Partridge J.D. Scott C. Tang Y. Poole R.K. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27806-27815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The use of chemostat cultures allows very reproducible initial states to be established in which important parameters such as growth rate, pH, O2 tension, and growth medium composition can be controlled and measured. Thus, the use of chemostat cultures has been shown to offer major benefits for transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies (20Partridge J.D. Scott C. Tang Y. Poole R.K. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27806-27815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Hayes A. Zhang N. Wu J. Butler P.R. Hauser N.C. Hoheisel J.D. Lim F.L. Sharrocks A.D. Oliver S.G.

Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3153-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), resulting in greater reproducibility of analyses between different laboratories, in comparison to the same studies using batch cultures (23Piper M.D. Daran-Lapujade P. Bro C. Regenberg B. Knudsen S. Nielsen J. Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37001-37008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a criticism of the use of continuous culture in studies of this type has been the potential to select for loss-of-function rpoS mutations, particularly at low growth rates (7Constantinidou C. Hobman J.L. Griffiths L. Patel M.D. Penn C.W. Cole J.A. Overton T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4802-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, published evidence suggests that this does not occur under anaerobic conditions (24King T. Ferenci T. FEMS Micro. Lett. 2005; 244: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or in E. coli MG1655 (25King T. Ishihama A. Kori A. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5614-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the present work we combine chemostat cultures of E. coli MG1655 with transcript profiling to investigate transcriptional changes during the transition of glucose-limited chemostat cultures from aerobic (100% air saturation, ∼210 μm dissolved O2) to microaerobic conditions (O2 transfer rate to the culture of 12 ± 0.5 mmol min-1 liter-1). The choice of glucose as the carbon source will ultimately allow the full range of metabolic modes (aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration and fermentation) to be investigated without the need to change the carbon source, but will affect the responses of transcripts such as ansB, that are co-dependent on the cyclic-AMP receptor protein for expression. The dilution rate chosen (0.2 h-1) was lower than the μmax under micro-aerobic conditions, thus allowing the cultures the potential to respond to changes in O2 availability without changes in growth rate. Nevertheless, any temporary changes in growth rate during adaptation to the new conditions forms an integral component of the response and will be reflected in the transcriptome. Samples from the aerobic steady-state culture were rapidly flushed into RNA protect (Qiagen) for isolation of total RNA. Switching off the air that was sparging the culture perturbed the aerobic steady-state. Samples were obtained for RNA preparation 5, 10, 15, and 60 min after the air supply to the culture was lowered. The corresponding labeled cDNAs were synthesized and used to probe E. coli K12 arrays (Ocimum Biosolutions). For initial analysis of the data a significant change in transcript abundance was defined as ≥2-fold (p ≤ 0.05) at one or more of the time points analyzed. The full dataset is available (GEO accession number GSE6644). Lowered O2 Availability Leads to Predictable Changes in Transcripts Encoding Proteins of Central Metabolism—Lowering the supply of O2 to E. coli cultures should have predictable effects on the transcription of genes involved in central metabolism. In accord with previous work, the transcript profiling experiments are consistent with the function of the PDHC being partially replaced by PFL; repression of citric acid cycle genes and replacement of succinate dehydrogenase by fumarate reductase; induction of a route from oxaloacetate to fumarate via aspartate; expression of the cydAB encoded terminal oxidase; and induction of anaerobic reductases (26Green J. Guest J.R. Busby S.J.W. Thomas C.M. Brown N.L. Molecular Microbiology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 17-39Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Notably, the terminal reductases NarGHIJ and Nir-BCD are transiently induced, exhibiting maximal transcript abundances after 10-15 min of O2 depletion, even in the absence of nitrate or nitrite (Table 1).TABLE 1Transcripts encoding proteins of central metabolism that are present in altered abundance after lowering the supply of air to cultures of E. coli MG1655OperonaThe data shown are for the first gene in the operon unless otherwise indicated by bold font.ProductFold change in abundance relative to the aerobic steady-state at the indicated times (min) following the switch to micro-aerobic conditionsbFold change (by at least 2-fold at one or more time-points) is the ratio of transcript levels at the indicated time to the transcript levels at t = 0 (the initial aerobic state; p ≤ 0.05).Relevant regulatory proteinscRelevant regulatory proteins are indicated; (−) denotes negative regulation, (+) positive regulation, and (−/+) negative and positive regulation.5101560pdhR-aceE-aceF-lpdAPDHC−3.0FNR (−/+) PdhR (−)acnBAconitase B−3.4ArcA (−)aspA-dcuAAspartase2.22.3FNR (+)aspCAspartate transaminase1.4cydA-cydBCytochrome bd-1 oxidase2.92.43.1ArcA (+) FNR (−)focA-pflBFormate transport/PFL2.32.12.4ArcA (+/−) FNR (+)frdA-frdB-frdC-frdDFumarate reductase3.02.42.8FNR (+)gltACitrate synthase−2.5−4.3−3.4ArcA (−)hypA-hypB-hypC-hypD-hypEHydrogenase 34.25.07.3narG-narH-narI-narJNitrate reductase4.112.113.63.4FNR (+)nirB-nirC-nirD-cysGNitrite reductase5.44.7FNR (+)sdhC-sdhD-sdhA-sdhB-sucA-sucB-sucC-sucDSuccinate ehydrogenase/succinyl-CoA synthetase−11.5−5.4−3.2ArcA (−/+) FNR (−)yfiDPFL repair protein5.916.410.715.5ArcA (+) FNR (+/−) CpxR (−)a The data shown are for the first gene in the operon unless otherwise indicated by bold font.b Fold change (by at least 2-fold at one or more time-points) is the ratio of transcript levels at the indicated time to the transcript levels at t = 0 (the initial aerobic state; p ≤ 0.05).c Relevant regulatory proteins are indicated; (−) denotes negative regulation, (+) positive regulation, and (−/+) negative and positive regulation. Open table in a new tab The yfiD transcript, encoding a protein that repairs oxygenolytically cleaved PFL under micro-aerobic conditions (27Wagner A.F. Schultz S. Bomke J. Pils T. Lehmann W.G. Knappe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was markedly increased in abundance (Table 1). Maximal yfiD expression under micro-aerobic conditions is achieved by the O2-responsive transcription factor FNR binding to tandem sites in yfiD promoter, mediating activation from the downstream site and repression from the upstream site (28Marshall F.A. Messenger S.L. Wyborn N.R. Guest J.R. Wing H. Busby S.J.W. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ArcA antagonizes FNR repression (15Wyborn N.R. Messenger S.L. Henderson R.A. Sawers G. Roberts R.E. Attwood M.M. Green J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The increased abundance of the yfiD transcript, which was confirmed by RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S1), is consistent with the micro-aerobic status of the cultures after lowering the air supply. The phenotype of the yfiD mutant was analyzed in competitive index experiments, to determine whether the changes in transcript abundance were reflected in culture physiology. An index of <1.0 indicates that the mutant is impaired compared with the parent. For micro-aerobic conditions, the value was 0.12 ± 0.03; for anaerobic conditions the value was 0.65 ± 0.11 (mean ± S.D., n = 6). Thus, growth of the yfiD mutant was significantly impaired under micro-aerobic conditions compared with the parent, suggesting that the changes in transcription are physiologically relevant. FNR and ArcA are the major regulators responsible for adaptation of central metabolism to changes in O2 availability (Table 1). To gain further insight into this regulatory network, a probabilistic model was used to infer FNR and ArcA activity profiles during the transition from aerobic to micro-aerobic conditions. The activity profiles show that FNR (Fig. 1B, blue line) responds rapidly to the change in culture aeration, whereas ArcA (Fig. 1B, red line) responds more slowly. Furthermore, it is inferred from the model that FNR activity peaks after 10 min and then significantly decreases as time proceeds, while the activity of ArcA increases up to 15 min and then stabilizes. The delay in the ArcBA response compared with FNR might reflect the signals perceived by these two transcription factors; FNR is a direct O2 sensor and responds rapidly, whereas ArcBA monitors O2 indirectly, via the redox state of the quinone pool, and responds more slowly. Moreover, arcA expression is regulated by FNR (29Compan I. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interruption of the O2 Supply to Aerobic Cultures Changes Metal Ion Physiology—Metal ion homeostasis is important for maintaining viability because many metal ions are not only essential, but also toxic. Switching E. coli cultures from aerobic to micro-aerobic growth conditions increased the abundance of transcripts involved in copper management (Table 2). Under aerobic conditions the CopA/CueO system is the major contributor to copper tolerance (30Outten F.W. Huffman D.L. Hale J.A. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30670-30677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). CopA removes copper from the cytoplasm to the periplasm where toxic Cu(I) is oxidized to the less toxic Cu(II) by the multi-copper oxidase, CueO, in a copper- and O2-dependent reaction. Expression of copA and cueO is regulated by CueR, but only copA responded to lower O2 availability, exhibiting maximal abundance 10 min into the switch to micro-aerobic conditions (Table 2). Thus, copA transcript abundance during the transition was similar to the inferred activity of FNR (see above). Analysis of the copA promoter revealed a potential FNR site (cTGATGCAAATCgA), with only two mismatches (shown in lowercase) compared with the consensus. This site is centered at -93.5 relative to the copA transcript start (31Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggesting that copA has a class I FNR-dependent promoter, which was confirmed by in vivo transcription using a single copy copA-lacZ fusion that responded to O2 availability in an FNR-dependent manner (supplemental Table S1). Thus, the model correctly predicted that FNR regulates copA.TABLE 2Transcripts encoding proteins with known or predicted roles in metal ion homeostasis that are present in altered abundance after lowering of the air supply to cultures of E. coli MG1655OperonaThe data shown are for the first gene in the operon.ProductFold increase in abundance relative to the aerobic steady-state at the indicated times (min) following the switch to micro-aerobic conditionsbFold increase (by at least 2-fold at one or more time-points) is the ratio of transcript levels at the indicated time after interrupting the air supply to the transcript levels at t = 0 (the initial aerobic state; p ≤ 0.05).Relevant regulatory proteinscRelevant regulatory proteins are indicated; (−) negative regulation, (+) positive regulation by the indicated transcription factor.5101560copACopper translocating P-type ATPase2.25.23.13.9CueR (+) FNR (+)cusC-cusF-cusB-cusACus copper efflux system2.12.52.83.5CusR (+)cusR-cusSTwo-component regulator of Cus1.71.92.42.4CusR (+)cutCCopper homeostasis protein2.22.01.5RpoE (+)feoA-feoB-yhgGFerrous ion transporter4.07.56.24.7Fur (−) FNR (+)ftnBPredicted ferritin3.72.63.7RpoE (+)moaAMolybdopterin biosynthesis protein2.93.12.2FNR (+) CueR (−)a The data shown are for the first gene in the operon.b Fold increase (by at least 2-fold at one or more time-points) is the ratio of transcript levels at the indicated time after interrupting the air supply to the transcript levels at t = 0 (the initial aerobic state; p ≤ 0.05).c Relevant regulatory proteins are indicated; (−) negative regulation, (+) positive regulation by the indicated transcription factor. Open table in a new tab The moaABCDE operon encodes proteins required for molybdopterin biosynthesis and, like copA, is CueR-regulated (31Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Analysis of moa transcripts revealed the presence of a copper-repressed promoter upstream of moaA and a copperinducible transcript originating upstream of moaB (31Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). During the transition to micro-aerobic conditions the moaA transcript was present in increased abundance (Table 2). However, the regulation observed here is not consistent with CueR-mediated repression of moaA and copper-mediated activation of moaB (31Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus like copA, the increased abundance of moa transcripts is most likely explained by FNR-mediated activation of the moa promoter in response to lower O2 availability (32Anderson L.A. McNaurn E. Leubke T. Pau R.N. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7035-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast to CopA, the CusCFBA transporter moves copper ions directly to the external milieu (30Outten F.W. Huffman D.L. Hale J.A. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol.

The agonists for Nods activate proinflammatory signaling pathways, including NF-κB pathways. The results from our previous studies showed that the activation of TLR4 and TLR2, leucine-rich repeat-containing pattern recognition receptors, were differentially modulated by saturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in macrophages and dendritic cells. Here, we show the differential modulation of NF-κB activation and interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in colonic epithelial cells HCT116 by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids mediated through Nods proteins. Lauric acid (C12:0) dose dependently activated NF-κB and induced IL-8 expression in HCT116 cells, which express both Nod1 and Nod2, but not detectable amounts of TLR2 and TLR4. These effects of lauric acid were inhibited by dominant negative forms of Nod1 or Nod2, but not by dominant negative forms of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5. The effects of lauric acid were also attenuated by small RNA interference targeting Nod1 or Nod2. In contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, inhibited the activation of NF-κB and IL-8 expression induced by lauric acid or known Nods ligands in HCT116. Furthermore, lauric acid induced, but docosahexaenoic acid inhibited lauric acid- or Nod2 ligand MDP-induced, Nod2 oligomerization in HEK293T cells transfected with Nod2. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of dietary fatty acids in modulating inflammation in colon epithelial cells. The results suggest that Nods may be involved in inducing sterile inflammation, one of the key etiological conditions in the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases.

Lauric acid (C12:0) dose dependently activated NF-κB and induced IL-8 expression in HCT116 cells, which express both Nod1 and Nod2, but not detectable amounts of TLR2 and TLR4. These effects of lauric acid were inhibited by dominant negative forms of Nod1 or Nod2, but not by dominant negative forms of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5. The effects of lauric acid were also attenuated by small RNA interference targeting Nod1 or Nod2. In contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, inhibited the activation of NF-κB and IL-8 expression induced by lauric acid or known Nods ligands in HCT116. Furthermore, lauric acid induced, but docosahexaenoic acid inhibited lauric acid- or Nod2 ligand MDP-induced, Nod2 oligomerization in HEK293T cells transfected with Nod2. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of dietary fatty acids in modulating inflammation in colon epithelial cells. The results suggest that Nods may be involved in inducing sterile inflammation, one of the key etiological conditions in the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases. Evolution of host defense systems against microbial pathogens is the key for the survival of all multicellular organisms.

In addition to TLRs, cytosolic proteins, the family of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins (Nods), recognizes intracellular bacterial products and activates pro-inflammatory signaling pathways (5Carneiro L.A. Travassos L.H. Philpott D.J. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Inohara N. Ogura Y. Nunez G. Curr. Opin.

Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Currently, there are thirteen TLRs identified in mammalian cells. Each TLR is thought to respond to different types of agonists through their leucine-rich repeat domains. For examples, TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide derived from Gram-negative bacteria. TLR2 forms a heterodimer with TLR1 or TLR6 to discriminate triacylated bacterial lipopeptides from diacylated mycoplasmal lipopeptides. Upon activated by agonists, the intracellular TIR domains of TLRs recruit adaptor molecules, such as MyD88 or Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β, to initiate downstream NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Similarly, Nods proteins have also been demonstrated to recognize their ligands through the leucine-rich repeat domain at the COOH terminus (9Chamaillard M. Girardin S.E. Viala J. Philpott D.J. Cell Microbiol. 2003; 5: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 10Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The minimal peptidoglycan structure that Nod1 recognizes is a dipeptide, γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) derived mostly from Gram-negative bacteria, whereas Nod2 recognizes the minimal peptidoglycan muramyl dipeptide, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln (MDP), from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (11Girardin S.E.

The activation of Nod2 leads to the recruitment of a CARD domain-containing kinase, RICK/RIP2, through a CARD-CARD interaction, which then leads to the interaction with the regulatory subunit of IKK, IKKγ/NEMO, linking to the activation of NF-κB and pro-inflammatory gene expression (15Inohara N.

Thus, despite the apparent differences between TLRs and Nods, these two families of pattern recognition receptors both are thought to recognize their ligands through the leucine-rich repeats domain and activate common NF-κB pathways. Mutations in Nod2 gene have been implicated in certain inflammatory diseases. The three major Nod2 mutations (1007fs, R702W, and G908R) have been found to be associated with increased susceptibility to Crohn disease, a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the bowel (17Inohara N. Chamaillard M. McDonald C. Nunez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; Google Scholar). Dietary fatty acids have been known to modulate immune responses. It has been demonstrated that the survival of mice fed with fish oil, whose major fatty acids are n-3 PUFAs, was diminished after bacterial infection as compared with mice fed with diet rich in saturated fatty acids or n-6 PUFA (18Fritsche K.L. Shahbazian L.M. Feng C. Berg J.N. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1997; 92: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Chang H.R. Dulloo A.G. Vladoianu I.R. Piguet P.F. Arsenijevic D. Girardier L. Pechere J.C. Metabolism. 1992; 41: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, n-3 PUFAs have been suggested to be beneficial in ameliorating various chronic inflammatory diseases including Crohn disease because of their anti-inflammatory properties (20Belluzzi A. Boschi S. Brignola C. Munarini A. Cariani G. Miglio F. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 339S-342SCrossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms for the effects of these fatty acids remain largely unknown. The results from our previous studies demonstrated that lauric acid (C12:0) activated, but docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 PUFA, inhibited both NF-κB activation and the expression of the target gene, inducible cyclooxygenase-2, in macrophages. This was at least in part mediated through TLR4 or TLR2 dimerized with TLR6 or TLR1, for which respective bacterial agonists require acylated fatty acids, but not through other TLRs tested (21Lee J.Y.

Consequently, the maturation and antigen-presenting abilities of dendritic cells (the major antigen-presenting cells), which express TLRs, were also shown to be differentially modulated by these fatty acids (23Weatherill A.R. Lee J.Y. Zhao L. Lemay D.G. Youn H.S. Hwang D.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5390-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In addition to these immune cells, intestinal epithelial cells, representing the first line of defense against invasive pathogens, play important roles in mucosal immunity against luminal pathogens through its expression of pro-inflammatory genes, secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and recruitment of inflammatory cells in response to pathogenic bacteria and their products. The dys-regulation of the interaction between the intestinal epithelial cells and luminal bacteria is suggested to cause inflammatory diseases in gut, especially in susceptible individuals (24Hanauer S.B. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2006; 12: S3-S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Moreover, as major absorptive sites, intestinal epithelial cells are exposed to a relatively higher concentration of fatty acids during each meal. However, the effects of dietary fatty acids on inflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells have not been studied. Here, we show the differential modulation of NF-κB activation and the target gene interleukin-8 production by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the human colonic epithelial cell line HCT116. These effects of fatty acids are mediated through Nod1 and Nod2, in the absence of detectable amounts of TLR2 and TLR4 expression.

Human IL-8 (-173bp)-Luc was from Marie Annick Buendia (Institute Pasteur, France). pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid was from Jongdae Lee (University of California, San Diego, CA). Dominant negative forms of TLR4 (TLR4(P712H)) and TLR2 (TLR2(P681H)) were described previously (21Lee J.Y. Sohn K.H. Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol.

A dominant negative form of TLR5 (TLR5 (P737H)) was cloned by substituting proline at residue 737 with histidine. A dominant negative mutant of RICK/RIP2 (pCMV-RICK/RIP2-(1–434)) was provided by Genhong Cheng (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). A dominant negative mutant of IKKβ (IKKβ(K44M)) was obtained from Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego). A dominant negative mutant of inhibitor κB (pCMV4-IκBα(ΔN)) was provided by Dean Ballard (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). All DNA constructs were prepared in large scale using the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen) for transfection. RT-PCR and Semi-quantitative Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from HEK293T, HCT116, HT29, NCM460, or THP-1 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of total RNAs was used for cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The primers used to detect mRNA expression were as follows: human TLR2, 5′-gcc aaa gtc ttg att gat tgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttg aag ttc tcc agc tcc tg-3′ (reverse); TLR4, 5′-tgg ata cgt ttc ctt ata ag-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaa atg gag gca ccc ctt c-3′ (reverse); TLR5, 5′-tca aac ccc ttc aga gaa tcc c-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttg gag ttg agg ctt agt ccc c-3′ (reverse); TLR7, 5′-ttg gct tct gct caa atg c-3′ (forward) and 5′-cta aag gtt gga att cac tgc c-3′ (reverse); TLR9, 5′-cag cag ctc tgc agt acg tc-3′ (forward) and 5′-aag gcc agg taa ttg tca cg-3′ (reverse); Nod1, 5′-tcc aaa gcc aaa cag aaa ctc-3′(forward) and 5′-cag cat cca gat gaa cgt g-3′ (reverse); Nod2, 5′-gaa tgt tgg gca cct caa gt-3′ (forward) and 5′-caa gga gct tag cca tgg ag-3′ (reverse); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-tca tct ctg ccc cct ctg ct-3′ (forward) and 5′-cga cgc ctg ctt cac cac ct-3′ (reverse). The following PCR program was used on iCycler (Bio-Rad): denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 58–60 °C for 20s, and extension at 72 °C for 25 s. The resulting PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gels. Total RNA was isolated from HCT116 cells after treatments with vehicle control, increasing doses of lauric acid or MDP for 18 h. IL-8 mRNA level was determined by semi-quantitative real-time PCR following reverse transcription with a LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). The primers used for human IL-8 were 5′-gta aac atg act tcc aag ctg g-3′ (forward) and 5′-gcc ctc ttc aaa aac ttc tcc a-3′ (reverse). The primers used for human β-actin (as an internal control) were 5′-gtc gtc gac aac ggc tcc ggc atg tg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cat tgt aga agg tgt ggt gcc aca t-3′ (reverse). Samples were compared using the relative crossing-point values (Cp) method. The Cp value, which is inversely proportional to the initial template copy number, was determined by the LightCycler software program provided by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). The -fold induction of IL-8 expression relative to vehicle control was measured three times in duplicates and calculated after adjusting for β-actin using 2ΔΔCp, where ΔCp = Cp β-actin – Cp IL-8, and ΔΔCp =ΔCp treatment –ΔCp control as described previously (22Lee J.Y. Zhao L. Youn H.S. Weatherill A.R. Tapping R. Feng L. Lee W.H. Fitzgerald K.A. Hwang D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16971-16979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Transfections and Luciferase Assays—For transient transfections and luciferase assays, HEK293T or HCT116 were seeded 4–5 × 104 per well of 24-well plates, and co-transfected with 2xNF-κB-Luc or IL-8(-173bp)-Luc and pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Nod1 and Nod2 transfection experiments in 293T, 2 ng of pcDNA3-Nod1-HA, or 1.5 ng of pcDNA3-Nod2-HA was co-transfected with reporter gene and β-galactosidase plasmid. Various expression plasmids for dominant negative form of TLRs, Nods, or of downstream components, or their corresponding empty vectors were co-transfected as indicated in the figure legends. The total amount of plasmids was equalized by supplementing with the corresponding empty vector to eliminate the experimental errors from transfection itself. The cells were stimulated with saturated fatty acids, Nods agonist, or vehicle controls. In unsaturated fatty acid experiments, the cells were pretreated with unsaturated fatty acids for 1–2 h and co-treated further with other stimuli for 15–18 h before lysis. Luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme activities were determined using a luciferase assay system and β-galactosidase enzyme system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity to correct the transfection efficiency. Immunoblotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—These experiments were performed essentially the same as previously described (21Lee J.Y. Sohn K.H. Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol.

The cells were stimulated with lauric acid, MDP, or pretreated with DHA, then co-stimulated with lauric acid or MDP as indicated in the figure legends. For Nod2 oligomerization experiments, 293T cells, 5.0 × 106 per 100-mm dish, were transfected with 2 μg of HA- and 2 μg of FLAG-tagged Nod2 for 24 h and treated as described in the figure legends. The resulting proteins co-immunoprecipitated with HA-affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) were analyzed for the presence of FLAG-tagged Nod2 using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). The solubilized proteins from co-immunoprecipitation or from the cell lysate from HCT116 were subjected to 7.5–10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (pH 7.6) containing 5% nonfat milk. The membrane was probed with primary antibody for 1–24 h, followed by secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The protein signals were detected by ECL Western blot detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposing to an x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). To reprobe with different antibodies, the membrane was stripped in stripping buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 53 °C for 30 min. Measurement of IL-8—The supernatants of HCT116 cells that were transiently transfected for reporter gene assays and/or stimulated by different stimuli were collected, and the levels of IL-8 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (OptEIA ELISA kits, BD Pharmingen). RNA Interference—Nod1 and Nod2 siRNA targeting 5′-AAGAGCCTCTTTGTCTTCACC-3′ of human Nod1 and 5′-AAGACATCTTCCAGTTACTCC-3′ of human Nod2 were custom synthesized; non-targeting control siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of siRNA (final concentration, 200 nm) in HCT116 cells was performed using TransIT-TKO reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed by paired t test or one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Expression and Functional Status of TLRs and Nods in Colonic Epithelial HCT116 Cells—To determine the effects of dietary fatty acids on the inflammatory responses in intestinal cells, we first analyzed the expression of TLRs and Nods and their functional status in these cells by RT-PCR and NF-κB reporter gene assays in response to synthetic ligands for these receptors. Colonic epithelial HCT116, HT29, and NCM460 cells all express TLR5, TLR7, and TLR9, but the expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 are different among these cell lines (Fig. 1A). HCT116 cells do not express detectable amounts of TLR2 and TLR4. HEK293T cells also do not express detectable amounts of TLR4 and TLR2, consistent with previous reports (11Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jehanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.K. Labigne A. Zahringer U. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J.

Nod2 protein expression has been reported in HCT116 (31Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To confirm the expression results, we examined the functional status of these receptors by NF-κB reporter gene assays. Consistent with RT-PCR data, HCT116 cells respond only to flagellin, the TLR5 ligand, but not Pam3CAG and MALP-2, the ligands for TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6 dimers, respectively, and lipopolysaccharide, the TLR4 ligand. This result is in agreement with the observations by others that, under normal conditions, the intestinal epithelial cells do not respond to any TLR ligands other than flagellin (32Gewirtz A.T. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Melmed G. Thomas L.S. Lee N. Tesfay S.Y. Lukasek K. Michelsen K.S. Zhou Y. Hu B. Arditi M. Abreu M.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1406-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In contrast, HCT116 cells responded to iE-DAP, the minimal peptidoglycan recognized by Nod1, and MDP, the minimal peptidoglycan recognized by Nod2 (Fig. 1B). Thus, HCT116 cells are chosen to be studied further for the effects of fatty acids in the absence of TLR2 and TLR4, which are known to be modulated by fatty acids (21Lee J.Y. Sohn K.H. Rhee S.H.

Saturated Fatty Acids Activated, but PUFAs Inhibited, NF-κB Activation, and the Nods Target Gene IL-8 Expression in HCT116 Cells—Next, we examined the effects of fatty acids on inflammatory responses in HCT116 cells using NF-κB and IL-8 reporter gene assays and IL-8 protein production. Lauric acid (C12:0) dose dependently induced activation of NF-κB and the target gene IL-8 expression. The levels of activation of NF-κB and IL-8 by lauric acid (100 μm) were comparable to those by iE-DAP (20 μg/ml) or MDP (25 μg/ml) (Fig. 2A). The activation was confirmed by IL-8 protein measurement in the supernatant of the same cells (Fig. 2B). To further confirm the dose-dependent effects of lauric acid on IL-8 transactivation, we measured IL-8 mRNA levels. Lauric acid dose dependently induced IL-8 mRNA expression in these cells (Fig. 2C). Lauric acid is the most potent in inducing IL-8 as compared with other saturated fatty acids (Fig. 2, D and E). In contrast, DHA, an n-3 PUFA, did not induce, but rather inhibited, NF-κB and IL-8 activation induced by lauric acid, iE-DAP, or MDP (Fig. 3, A–E). Moreover, we also compared the inhibitory potency among unsaturated FAs. DHA and EPA, n-3 PUFAs, are the most potent in inhibiting Nod2 ligand MDP-induced IL-8 expression as compared with arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, n-6 PUFAs and oleic acid, n-9 monounsaturated fatty acid (Fig. 3, D and E). To determine whether the preincubation of lauric acid might also interfere with the Nod2-ligand interaction, we performed the experiments by pretreating the cells with lauric acid at the concentration used for DHA in Fig. 3 (A–C), prior to MDP stimulation for 18 h. Lauric acid did not inhibit MDP-induced NF-κB and IL-8 activation, but rather potentiated MDP-induced IL-8 transactivation, although the change was not statistically significant (Fig. 3F).FIGURE 3Polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibited the NF-κB activation and IL-8 expression induced by lauric acid, iE-DAP, or MDP in HCT116 cells.

In the human colon cancer cell line SW1116, treatment with the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) or the ERK-MAPK inhibitors PD98059 or rottlerin, or transient transfection with the MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 small interfering RNA down-regulates DNMT1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels.

Colon cancer is one of the most commonly occurring tumors and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Cells derived from the colon cancer cell line SW1116 are frequently used in molecular biological experiments (1Gao Z. Gao Z. Fields J.Z. Boman B.M. Int. J.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar). The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-MAPK pathway is a critical pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) in this pathway modulate a wide variety of cellular activities via the regulation of several transcription factors. The ability of the ERK-MAPK pathway to promote cell growth by activation of cyclin D is counterbalanced by the concomitant production of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1. Moderate activation of the pathway leads to cell proliferation, whereas hyperactivation results in p21WAF1-mediated growth arrest. In addition, induction of the cell cycle inhibitory INK4 proteins, including p16INK4A, is mediated by the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (6Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have indicated that overexpression and activation of ERK-MAPK plays an important role in colon cancer progression, and that may be a useful molecular target for colon cancer therapy (7Fang J.Y. Richardson B.C. Lancet Oncol. 2005; 6: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To date, 11 protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes have been identified (8Biro T. Griger Z. Kiss E. Papp H. Aleksza M. Kovacs I. Zeher M. Bodolay E. Csepany T. Szucs K. Gergely P. Kovacs L. Szegedi G. Sipka S. Scand. J.

They have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, as well as in apoptosis and tumor progression (9Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug. Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although PKC-δ is the most thoroughly studied member in the PKC subfamily, many questions remain to be answered about its substrate-specific activities (10Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Aberrant DNA methylation is now considered as an important epigenetic alteration that is intimately involved in the initiation and development of colon cancer in both mouse and human tumor model systems (11Fang J.Y.

In particular, hypermethylation in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes correlates with the loss of expression of these genes in cancer cell lines and primary tumors (13Esteller M. Sparks A. Toyota M. Sanchez-Cespedes M. Capella G. Peinado M.A. Gonzalez S. Tarafa G. Sidransky D. Meltzer S.J. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4366-4371PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jackson-Grusby L.

In recent years, several reports have shown that two ERK-MAPK inhibitors, procainamide and hydralazine, produce hypomethylation in T cell lines (4Scheinbart L.S. Johnson M.A. Gross L.A. Edelstein S.R. Richardson B.C. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 530-534PubMed Google Scholar, 15Deng C. Yang J. Scott J. Hanash S. Richardson B.C. Biol.

Res. 2003; 528: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations have led to efforts to use these drugs to demethylate tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. However, the mechanism whereby these ERK-MAPK pathway inhibitors affect DNA methylation that silences gene transcription in cancer, particularly in human colon cancer, is poorly understood. Furthermore, the effect of the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin (18Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) on tumor-related gene regulation and the cell cycle in human colon cancer cell lines is unknown. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the etiological association of the ERK-MAPK pathway and methylation in human colon cancer, and to investigate the extent of the loss of MAP/ERK kinases (MEK) 1 and 2 and the effects of ERK signaling on cell proliferation and cycling. A colon cancer cell line, SW1116, was incubated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (2-(2′-amino-3′-methoxyphenyl) oxanaphthalen-4-one, a MEK inhibitor) and the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin, and transiently transfected with the selective ablation of MEK subtypes by RNA interference (RNAi). The influence of these drugs or transfections on DNA methylation, subsequent expression of tumor suppressor genes, and the cell cycle were also assessed. We also investigated the mediating mechanisms of ERK-MAPK on DNA methylation. Cell Culture—The colon cancer-derived cell line SW1116 was maintained by serial passages in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C using standard tissue culture incubators as previously described (11Fang J.Y. Lu R. Mikovits J.A. Cheng Z.H. Zhu H.Y. Chen Y.X. Cancer Lett. 2006; 233: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A total of 106 cells were plated per 100-mm dish. Treatment with PD98059, Rottlerin, and 5-aza-dC—PD98059 and rottlerin were purchased from Promega and Sigma, respectively. The inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and used at final concentrations of 50 and 20 μm, respectively. ERK-MAPK inhibitor treatments were performed on serumstarved SW1116 cells before stimulation with 50 ng/ml of phorbol myristate acetate for 15 min. To assess the effect of these inhibitors on methylation and gene expression, the cells were exposed to different concentrations, 2, 5, and 10 μm 5-aza-dC (Sigma) for 24 and 72 h as the controls for ERK-MAPK inhibitor treatment. Cells treated with Me2SO for 24 h were used as a vehicle controls. DNA and RNA were harvested at various time points throughout the treatments. RNAi and Transient Transfections—MEK1/2 expression was inhibited with reagents from commercial siRNA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SignalSilence™ MEK1 kit and SignalSilence™ MEK2 kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) included human MEK1 siRNA, MEK2 siRNA, control siRNA (Fluorescein Conjugate), and siRNA transfection reagent. Briefly, SW1116 were seeded in 12-well plates in medium containing 10% serum at a density that would allow cells to reach 50% confluence on the day of transfection. The transient transfections were performed using 100 nm of each siRNA duplex. For the double knock-down, 100 nm MEK1 and MEK2 siRNA were used. These siRNAs were complexed with transfection reagent, in serum-free and antibiotic-free culture fluid for 5 h at 37°C. After the transfection reagents were applied, cellular media were replaced with serum-containing maintenance media and the cells were incubated for 48 h. All experiments were repeated at least three times. The transfection efficiency was determined by fluorescein-conjugated nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan). Cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with lysis buffer (K2HPO4, Triton), and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity. The protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce), and luciferase activity was quantitated by luciferase assays (Promega) using a luminometer. The selective silencing of the appropriate MEK isozymes was confirmed by Western blotting with MEK1- and MEK2-specific antibodies. Cell Viability Assays—The SW1116 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates with 2000 cells/well, cultured for 24 h, and transfected with the indicated siRNAs. The cells were then treated with the ERK-MAPK inhibitors or 5-aza-dC. Cell proliferation was measured using the methylthiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenytetrazolium, Calbiochem) colorimetric dye assay in quadruplicate. At each time point, the SW1116 cells were incubated with 0.3 ml of MTT dye (1 mg/ml in serum-free media) for 2 h at 37°C. Adding 200 μl of 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol produced the color, the absorbance of which was monitored at 570 nm. Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR for mRNA Expression of Tumor Suppressor Genes—To evaluate the efficiency of treatment with MAPK inhibitors or the DNMT inhibitor, and transfection with MEK1/2 siRNA, mRNA transcription levels of DNMTS, p16INK4A, and p21WAF1 were detected using real time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Total RNA was isolated with a commercial kit (TRIzol®) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription reactions using 5 μg of total RNA in a final reaction volume of 20 μl were performed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Relative quantitation data were obtained using the comparative Ct method with the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (software version 1.6) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers and fluorogenic probes were provided by Shenyou Company (Shanghai). The sequences of the probes and the primers, as well as the PCR conditions, are shown in Table 1. Real time PCR was also performed with the primers and probe for β-actin to normalize each of the extracts for amplifiable human DNA. Results were expressed as the ratio of copies of target genes to β-actin. The Ct values were measured, and the average Ct of triplicate samples was calculated. Significant alteration of mRNA expression was defined as a 3-fold difference in the expression level after treatment relative to that before treatment (19Scanlan M.J. Welt S. Gordon C.M. Chen Y.T.

Bisulfite modification protocols were adapted as described by Xiong and Laird (20Xiong Z. Laird P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2532-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA treated with bisulfite was amplified with p16INK4A and p21WAF1 promoter-specific primers (Table 2). The primers were designed without CpG dinucleotides to enable both methylated and unmethylated alleles to be amplified.TABLE 2Sequences of primers for MSP and bisulfite genomic sequencePrimerPrimer (forward) (5′ → 3′)Primer (reverse) (5′ → 3′)Product size and annealing temperatureGenBank accession numberMSPp16INK4A M-MSPTTATTAGAGGGTGGGGCGGATCGCGACCCCGAACCGCGACCGTAA150 bp, 65 °CX94154p16INK4A UM-MSPTTATTAGAGGGTGGGGTGGATTGTCAACCCCAAACCACAACCATAA151 bp, 60 °Cp21WAF1 M-MSPTTTTTGTAGTATGTGAGGTTTTGGAACACAACTCAACACAACCCTA202 bp, 53 °CNT_007592p21WAF1 UM-MSPTGTAGTACGCGAGGTTTCGTCAACTAACGCAACTCAACG200 bp, 56 °CBisulfite genomic sequencingp16INK4A (first PCR)ATTTTAGGGGTGTTATATCTACCTAATTCCAATTCCCCTACA50 °Cp16INK4A (second PCR)TTTTTAGAGGATTTGAGGGATAGGTTCCAATTCCCCTACAAA384 bp, 50 °Cp21WAF1 (first PCR)AATAGTGTTGTGTTTTTTTGGAGAGTCAAAAATTCCTATACTTATAATCCC57 °Cp21WAF1 (second PCR)GGGAGGAGGGAAGTGTTTTTACAACTACTCACACCTCAACT251 bp, 52 °C Open table in a new tab There were 100 ng of bisulfite-treated DNA, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 2.0 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μm primers in a 50-μl PCR. The PCR product was directly loaded onto 3% agarose gels and electrophoresed. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and directly visualized under UV illumination. Wild-type p16INK4A and p21WAF1 primers were used to verify that complete conversion of the DNA had occurred in the bisulfite reaction. A positive control for complete methylation was also amplified. To further identify the methylation pattern within the CpG islands of the p16INK4A and p21WAF1 promoter in SW1116 cells, bisulfite sequencing was performed. DNA was treated with bisulfite as described above. Primer sequences of p16INK4A and p21WAF1, annealing temperatures, and expected PCR product sizes are summarized in Table 2. PCR products were sequenced using ABI PRISM 3730 sequencer. Determination of DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), p21WAF1, Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), and Phospho-ERK-MAPKs Using Western Blotting—Western blot assays were performed to examine the phosphorylation of ERKMAPK molecules and DNMT1, p21WAF1, and PCNA protein expression. Whole cell extracts were prepared from both treated and mock-treated, or transfected and mock-transfected SW1116 cells by a previously described method (21Fang J.Y. Mikovits J.A. Bagni R. Petrow-Sadowski C.L. Ruscetti F.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9753-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, 400 μg of proteins were electroeluted at 120 V onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies raised against phosphorylated ERK1/2, pan-ERK1, pan-ERK2, phospho-MEK1/2, pan-MEK1/2, anti-MEK1, anti-MEK2, and phospho-PKC-δ were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Pan-PKC-δ was obtained from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA), which only recognizes the activated phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 by Western blot analysis. Antibody anti-DNMT1 was from New England BioLabs (Newton, MA), antibodies anti-p21WAF1 and anti-PCNA were purchased from Sigma. Antibody against β-actin (Sigma) was used as a control for protein input. The densities of the Western blotting bands in each lane were normalized to the amount of total protein (for DNMT1, PCNA, or p21WAF1) or total MAPKs as determined by the density of the β-actin band, or pan-MAPKs. For example, if the β-actin band was 30,000 units (pixels of brightness), then DNMT1 was normalized by the following calculation: 30,000/(density of β-actin) × (density of DNMT1). The Western blotting analysis was repeated at least three times (21Fang J.Y. Mikovits J.A. Bagni R. Petrow-Sadowski C.L. Ruscetti F.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9753-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometric (FCM) Detection of Cell Cycle Progression—Cell cycle analysis was carried out by FCM (22Bender C.M. Gonzalgo M.L. Gonzales F.A. Nguyen C.T. Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6690-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼1 × 108 cells were removed from treated and mock-treated cultures at specified time points. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in ice-cold ethanol for 1 h. The samples were then concentrated by removing the ethanol and exposure to 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 0.01% RNase (mg/ml, Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cellular DNA was stained in the dark with 0.05% propidium iodide for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell cycle distributions were determined using a flow cytometer (model FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). The data obtained from 10,000 cells was analyzed with the MultiCycle software package (Phoenix, San Diego, CA). Statistics—Data were representative of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate, and are presented as the mean ± S.D. Comparisons between groups were made using the Student's paired t test. Relationships were analyzed by Fisher's exact test using SAS 6.12 software. A value of p < 0.05 was taken to indicate a significant difference between the mean values. Both ERK-MAPK Inhibitors and siRNA Transfection Suppress Colon Cancer Cell Growth—We first examined the antiproliferative effects of ERK-MAPK inhibitors on the colon cancer cells. MTT assays showed that treatment of SW1116 cells with the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin resulted in a significant inhibition of growth starting from 24 h at 20 μmol/liter. Growth inhibition was also apparent at a low dose, 2.5 μmol/liter, after 72 h (Fig. 1A). Dose-dependent studies using MTT tests further demonstrated that after 72 h of treatment, the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 suppressed cell growth at intermediate concentrations (50 μmol/liter) (Fig. 1B). Our results indicated that RNAi-induced MEK1 or MEK2 deficiencies inhibited SW1116 cell growth, which declined maximally 24 h after transfection. This suppression lasted for another 12 h, and almost recovered at 48 h post-transfection. As shown in Fig. 1C, the degree of growth inhibition caused by siMEK1 was higher than that caused by siMEK2, whereas the growth inhibition was significantly different with both MEK1/2 deficient (siMEK1/2) at 24 h post-transfection (p < 0.01). PD98059 or Rottlerin Treatment Down-regulate Phosphorylation of ERK-MAPK—Cells were incubated with ERK-MAPK inhibitors, and cell lysates were analyzed for MAPKs phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. Total ERK1/2 protein levels were not decreased in PD98059- and rottlerin-treated lysates compared with the vehicle controls. However, PD98059 and rottlerin treatment did decrease the phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in SW1116 cells (Fig. 2, middle and upper panels). In contrast to the inhibition exerted by PD98059, rottlerin also significantly down-regulated the phosphorylation of PKC-δ (Fig. 2, lower panel). The Depletion Effect of MEK1 and MEK2 by RNAi—We used siRNA to selectively reduce the expression levels of MEK1 and MEK2, which are major subunits of the ERK-MAPK pathway. With the high transfection efficiency of siRNA (data not shown), Western blot analysis revealed that the MEK1/2 protein levels in SW1116 cells transfected with the MEK siRNAs singly and together were reduced to 36 ± 1.02, 34 ± 0.98, and 9 ± 0.76%, respectively. Control SW1116 cells transfected with nonsilencing siRNA in the three experiments produced normal MEK1 and MEK2 levels (Fig. 3A). The effect of depleting MEK and ERK activities by suppressing MEK1/2 was assessed in Western blots using anti-bodies specifically recognizing phosphorylated (and thus activated) MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Both knockdown experiments resulted in almost a total loss of pan- and phospho-MEK levels, whereas the phospho-ERK protein levels were analyzed as readouts for MEK activity upon MEK1/2 knock-down and the results showed that phospho-ERK was also descent (Fig. 3, B and C). ERK-MAPK Inhibitors and siRNA Transfection Repress PCNA and DNMT1, but Not DNMT3A and DNMT3B—Western blotting was also performed to examine the effects of ERK-MAPK inhibitors on PCNA and DNMT1. As shown in Fig. 4, rottlerin (p < 0.01) and PD98059 (p < 0.05) significantly down-regulated PCNA expression (Fig. 4), and also induced a decrease in DNMT1 protein expression (p < 0.05) that was similar to previous results obtained with cells treated by the DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-dC (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4). Blocking the ERK-MAPK pathway inhibited SW1116 cell growth, as assessed by measuring PCNA and DNMT levels. PCNA is a cell proliferation marker gene, and DNMT1 plays an important role in maintaining DNA methylation patterns via complicated networks including signaling pathways and transcriptional factors relating to cell differentiation or carcinogenesis. Thus, we analyzed the effects of MEK1 and MEK2 depletion on PCNA and DNMT1 protein levels 24 h following cellular transfections. Upon depletion of either MEK1 or MEK2 alone, the PCNA in protein levels decreased along with cell viability and proliferation. Moreover, the protein expression of PCNA was significantly decreased in the double knock-down of MEK1/2. Unexpectedly, our data indicated that the protein of DNMT1 expression decreased concordantly with cell proliferation inhibition and PCNA (Fig. 4). Furthermore, DNMT3A and DNMT3B are essential for de novo methylation. To clarify the effects of DNMT3A and DNMT3B with blocking the ERK-MAPK pathway, we examined their expressions by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 5). Our results indicated that ERK-MAPK inhibitors and siRNA transfection failed to affect the expression levels of DNMT3A and DNMT3B. ERK-MAPK Inhibitors and siRNA Transfection Up-regulate p16INK4A and p21WAF1—In this study, inhibiting the ERK-MAPK pathway induced cell cycle arrest. However, members of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family, including p21WAF1, p16INK4A, and p27KIP1, inhibit a wide range of cyclin CDK complexes involved in G1 and S phase progression. Thus, real time PCR was used to ascertain whether inhibiting or blocking the ERK-MAPK pathway exerts any effects on colon cancer-related tumor suppressor genes. The assay was also used to clarify whether PKC-δ and MEK1/2 signaling would interact with the methylation-selective tumor-related genes. We found that both PD98059 and rottlerin increased p16INK4A and p21WAF1 transcriptional levels, which is consistent with data from samples treated with 5-aza-dC (Fig. 5). The results of MEK1/2 depletion also showed that p16INK4A and p21WAF1 transcriptional levels increased. Meanwhile, Western blot analysis indicated that PD98059, rottlerin, and MEK1/2 siRNA induced p21WAF1 protein expression (Fig. 4). ERK-MAPK Inhibitors Treatment or siRNA Transient Transfection Induce Demethylation of p16INK4A and p21WAF1—To confirm that ERK-MAPK inhibition directly affect the methylation of p16INK4A and p21WAF1 promoters, the methylation status following treatments with ERK-MAPK inhibitors was determined using MSP. Bisulfite treatment converted cytosine residues in the genomic DNA to uracil, which were amplified as thymine during the subsequent PCR. As shown in Fig. 6, A and C, primers that specifically amplified either the methylated or unmethylated form of the p16INK4As promoter produced 150-bp methylated bands from mock-treated SW1116 cells, indicating that the p16INK4A promoter was methylated in these alleles. The methylated bands of the p16INK4A gene from cells treated with 5-aza-dC (10 μm) or ERK-MAPK inhibitors (50 μm PD98059 and 20 μm rottlerin), and MEK1/2 siRNA (100 nm) for 24 h were consistently less intense than the products of mock-treated cells. Thus, there was more 151-bp unmethylated product, than the corresponding methylated product, in 5-aza-dC or MAPK inhibitor-treated cells. These data indicated that untreated SW1116 cells were methylated at some CpG sites in most alleles. This finding also excluded the possibility that successful amplification could be attributed to incomplete bisulfite conversion. We also examined the methylation state of the p21WAF1 gene. As shown in Fig. 6, B and D, the methylated band was predominant in mock treated or transfection control cells. Similar to the results obtained with 5-aza-dC, rottlerin treatment and MEK1/2 depletion increased the unmethylated band and decreased the methylated band of the p21WAF1 promoter. Thus, PD98059 inhibitors favored the demethylation of p21WAF1. Sequencing analysis had the similar changes as MSP. As shown in Fig. 7, CpGs of p16INK4A and p21WAF1 promoters in mock treated SW1116 cells showed multiple cytosines due to the resistance of methylated cytosines within CpG dinucleotides to bisulfite conversion. However, using cells treated with 5-aza-dC or ERK-MAPK inhibitors (PD98059 and rottlerin), MEK1/2 siRNA transfection showed numerous thymidines due to sodium bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil. Finally, the correlation between promoter methylation status and reactivation of expression of p16INK4A and p21WAF1 genes treated with ERK-MAPK inhibitors or transfected with MEK1/2 siRNA was investigated. We found that increased p16INK4A and p21WAF1 mRNA expression were significantly associated with promoter demethylation. ERK-MAPK Inhibition Arrest the Cell Cycle—To further study the signaling pathways involved in ERK-MAPK inhibition-induced cell cycle arrest, the effects of PD98059, rottlerin, and MEK1/2 siRNA on p16INK4A, or p21WAF1-mediated G1 phase arrest, were evaluated. As illustrated in Fig. 8, pretreatment of SW1116 cells with rottlerin and MEK1/2 siRNA blocked the cell cycle in the G1 phase (p < 0.05). Interestingly, PD98059 caused another cell cycle perturbation, S-phase arrest (23Wu S.J. Ng L.T. Lin C.C. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 938-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (p < 0.05). This observation is consistent with up-regulation of p16INK4A and p21WAF1 mRNA, suggesting that the ERK-MAPK pathways are involved in this process and rottlerin partially induced G1 arrest. Overall, we consistently observed a relationship between p16INK4A and p21WAF1 expression and cell cycle arrest in PD98059- or rottlerin-treated cells, or MEK1/2 RNAi-transfected cells. Deregulation of the cell cycle commonly contributes to tumorigenesis in human colon cancer. The ERK-MAPK pa"

Mycolic acid biosynthesis is complex and the target of several frontline antimycobacterial drugs. The condensation of two fatty acids to form a 2-alkyl-3-keto mycolate precursor and the subsequent reduction of this precursor represent two key and highly conserved steps in this pathway. Although the enzyme catalyzing the condensation step has recently been identified, little is known about the putative reductase. Using an extensive bioinformatic comparison of the genomes of M. tuberculosis and Corynebacterium glutamicum, we identified NCgl2385, the orthologue of Rv2509 in M. tuberculosis, as a potential reductase candidate. Deletion of the gene in C. glutamicum resulted in a slow growing strain that was deficient in arabinogalactan-linked mycolates and synthesized abnormal forms of the mycolate-containing glycolipids trehalose dicorynomycolate and trehalose monocorynomycolate. Analysis of the native and acetylated trehalose glycolipids by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated that these novel glycolipids contained an unreduced β-keto ester. This was confirmed by analysis of sodium borodeuteride-reduced mycolic acids by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Reintroduction of the NCgl2385 gene into the mutant restored the transfer of mature mycolic acids to both the trehalose glycolipids and cell wall arabinogalactan. These data indicate that NCgl2385, which we have designated CmrA, is essential for the production of mature trehalose mycolates and subsequent covalent attachment of mycolic acids onto the cell wall, thus representing a focus for future structural and pathogenicity studies.

Several species of the suborder Corynebacterianeae are important human pathogens, most notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). 4The abbreviations used are: TB, tuberculosis; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; AG, arabinogalactan; TMM, trehalose monomycolate; TMCM, trehalose monocorynomycolate; TDM, trehalose dimycolate; TDCM, trehalose dicorynomycolate; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; AcPIM2, acylated phosphatidylinositol dimannoside; for, forward; rev, reverse. 4The abbreviations used are: TB, tuberculosis; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; AG, arabinogalactan; TMM, trehalose monomycolate; TMCM, trehalose monocorynomycolate; TDM, trehalose dimycolate; TDCM, trehalose dicorynomycolate; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; AcPIM2, acylated phosphatidylinositol dimannoside; for, forward; rev, reverse. Despite intensive efforts to control the disease, TB kills approximately 2 million people per year (1Raviglione M.C. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2003; 83: 4-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The prevalence of drug-resistant strains, including the recently identified extremely drug-resistant strains, has been labeled a global health emergency, underlying the need for new anti-mycobacterial therapies. Several current TB drugs target enzymes that synthesize the unique cell wall, an important bacterial virulence factor. The core of the cell wall consists of type 4 peptidoglycan covalently linked to arabinogalactan (AG), a polysaccharide of arabinose and galactose sugars which is, in turn, covalently linked to long chain 2-alkyl and 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the mycolic acids (2Brennan P.J. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2003; 83: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). These molecules vary in length from C60 to C90 in mycobacteria, but the equivalent species in corynebacteria, the corynomycolates, are significantly smaller (C22–C36) (3Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The covalently bound mycolates form the inner leaflet of an outer lipid bilayer with a number of noncovalently bound glycolipids, including trehalose monomycolate (TMM) and trehalose dimycolate (TDM) (2Brennan P.J. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2003; 83: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), forming the outer leaflet. The corynebacterial equivalents, trehalose monocorynomycolate (TMCM) and trehalose dicorynomycolate (TDCM), have identical structures except that they contain the shorter corynomycolates (4Tropis M. Meniche X. Wolf A. Gebhardt H. Strelkov S. Chami M. Schomburg D. Kramer R. Morbach S. Daffe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26573-26585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TDM, also known as cord factor, is a well established immunostimulatory compound with toxic properties (5Oswald I.P. Dozois C.M. Petit J.F. Lemaire G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chami M. Andreau K. Lemassu A. Petit J.F. Houssin C. Puech V. Bayan N. Chaby R. Daffe M. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 32: 141-147PubMed Google Scholar). The outer lipid bilayer forms the main permeability barrier around Corynebacterineae and is the major factor in the natural resistance of these bacteria to many antibiotics, the intracellular environment of the macrophage, and environmental stresses (7Liu J. Barry III, C.E. Besra G.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29545-29551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The structure and biosynthesis of mycolic acids have been intensively studied because of their functional importance, uniqueness, and the finding that many drugs, including the front line TB drug isoniazid, target several enzymes involved in their biosynthesis (8Schroeder E.K. de Souza N. Santos D.S. Blanchard J.S. Basso L.A. Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2002; 3: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the chain length of mycolic acids varies between Corynebacterineae, many chemical features of the mycolate molecules are conserved, most notably the mycolic motif (Fig. 1A). Several of the enzymes involved in early steps of mycolic acid biosynthesis have recently been identified in Corynebacterium glutamicum, a species that can tolerate the loss of mycolic acids allowing the characterization of viable mutants that cannot be derived in mycobacteria. In a recent important study, the polyketide synthase Pks13 was identified as the condensase required for condensation of the two fatty acids to form 2-alkyl, 3-keto mycolates (11Portevin D. De Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffe M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). All of these genes are essential for life in M. tuberculosis (12Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of the pathway in the human pathogen. Mature mycolates generated by this pathway are thought to be passed to lipid carriers for transport across the plasma membrane, before being attached to trehalose to form TMM/TMCM and TDM/TDCM, and subsequent esterification to AG (13Takayama K. Wang C. Besra G.S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). The final step of mycolic acid synthesis has been proposed to involve reduction of the β-keto ester to form the mycolic motif (Fig. 1C), but little is known about this step (9Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C.

Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the identification of three reductases as candidates for this enzyme, exploiting an extensive genome comparison between M. tuberculosis and C. glutamicum. Using a gene deletion approach in C. glutamicum, we show that one of these, cmrA, encodes this reductase activity as revealed by comprehensive analyses of the alterations to TDCM and TMCM in the mutant strain. Significantly, we demonstrate that reduction of the β-keto ester is important for subsequent attachment of mycolic acids to AG in Corynebacterineae. Bioinformatics Analysis—Identification of the conserved mycolate reductase and other conserved cell wall genes was undertaken by performing a FASTA BLAST comparison of every gene found in the C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 Kitasato gene list located at the TIGR comprehensive microbial resource against the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome using the FASTA sequence analysis program. E values and best matches in the M. tuberculosis genome were assigned based on these results. Amino acid similarity percentage values were assigned according to the results found in the protein versus all alignment menu located for each gene in the aforementioned C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 Kitasato gene list. Sequences were compared utilizing ClustalW. Strains and Culture Conditions—E. coli DH5α was cultured in Luria-Bertani media at 37 °C. All C. glutamicum strains, including the wild type strain ATCC 13032, were grown in BHI media (Oxoid) at 30 °C. 15 g/liter agar was used for preparation of solid media, and 10% sucrose (w/v) was added when necessary. C. glutamicum electrocompetent cells were prepared according to a protocol (23van der Rest M.E. Lange C. Molenaar D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 52: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) except that electroporation was performed at the following settings: 2.5 kV, 200 ohms, and 25 microfarads. Kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were added to media when necessary. Construction of the ΔNCgl2385 C. glutamicum Mutant and Complementation Plasmid—The entire NCgl2385 gene and flanking regions were amplified by PCR as a 2.28-kb fragment using Proofstart DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and the primers NCgl2385for (5′-CCCGAATTCGGGGCGGAAGAATTAGACTC-3′) and NCgl2385rev (5′-TGCGGATCCGTAGGACCAGGCTCTGCAAC-3′), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites (underlined) of pUC18 (24Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar). A 344-bp sequence internal to the gene was removed by XhoI/DraIII digestion, and the remaining sequence was religated and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the suicide plasmid pK18mobsacB (25Schafer A. Tauch A. Jager W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puhler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Following electroporation, kanamycin-resistant transformants were tested for the occurrence of single homologous recombination events by Southern blot hybridization using a probe prepared using the digoxigenin hybridization kit (Roche Applied Science). A verified single crossover clone was cultured on BHI plates containing 10% sucrose to select for double homologous recombination events. Deletion of the gene was screened by PCR using the primers NCgl2385for and NCgl2385rev and then confirmed by Southern blot hybridization analysis. One confirmed deletion strain, designated ΔNCgl2385, was selected for further analysis. Complementation of the mutant was performed by inserting the entire NCgl2385 gene in addition to 241 bp of upstream sequence and 109 bp of downstream sequence into the unique PvuII site of plasmid pSM22, which carries the Corynebacterium origin of replication repA and the kanamycin resistance gene aphA3 (26McKean S. Davies J. Moore R. Microbes Infect. 2005; 7: 1352-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), creating pSM22:NCgl2385. The complementation plasmid and empty pSM22 plasmid control were then electroporated into C. glutamicum ΔNCgl2385 and transformants selected on kanamycin plates. Extraction and Analysis of Cell Wall Lipids—All strains were grown to exponential phase (A600 nm = 7). Cell wall glycolipids were extracted as described previously (27Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Haites R.E. Kovacevic S. Coppel R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, PIMs and trehalose mycolates were extracted in chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) and chloroform:methanol:water (1:2:0.8 v/v). More polar components, such as LM/LAMs, were extracted from the delipidated pellet by reflux in 50% ethanol and AG-linked mycolates released from the resultant pellet with 0.1 m potassium hydroxide (2 ml, 48 h, 25 °C) (28Kovacevic S. Anderson D. Morita Y.S. Patterson J. Haites R. McMillan B.N. Coppel R. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9011-9017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Extracted glycolipids were analyzed on Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck) developed in chloroform, methanol, 13 m NH3, 1 m ammonium acetate, water (180:140:9:9:23, v/v) and detected with orcinol-H2SO4 (28Kovacevic S. Anderson D. Morita Y.S. Patterson J. Haites R. McMillan B.N. Coppel R. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9011-9017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The LM/LAM and mycolate fractions were analyzed after methanolysis, trimethylsilyl derivatization, and GC-MS, as described below. Arabinogalactan levels were determined by subjecting the delipidated, base-treated cell pellets to solvolysis in methanolic HCl and GC-MS analysis of the released methylglycosides and corynomycolate methyl esters. MALDI-TOF Analysis of Trehalose Glycolipids—Trehalose glycolipids were purified by HPTLC, and silica scrapings were extracted in chloroform:methanol:water (1:2:0.8 v/v). The extracts were dried and glycolipids recovered by biphasic partitioning in 1-butanol:water (1:1 v/v). Purified glycolipids (∼1 nmol) were analyzed directly or after O-acetylation by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF spectra were acquired on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) in the reflector mode. Native and acetylated samples (1 μl) were dissolved in 1-butanol and loaded onto a metal plate with 1 μl of matrix saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 60% 1-propanol and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce). Mass spectra were collected in positive ion mode using an extraction delay time set at 100 ns and an accelerating voltage of 21 kV. Isoglobotrihexosylceramide was used as an external standard (Sapphire Bioscience). Purified glycolipids were O-acetylated in 200 μl of pyridine:acetic anhydride (1:1 v/v) for 2 h at 80 °C. Solvents were removed under vacuum prior to analysis by MALDI-TOF. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry of Cell Wall Components—Cell wall extracts and purified trehalose glycolipids were subjected to solvolysis in 0.5 m methanolic HCl (50 μl, 80 °C, 16 h). Samples were neutralized with pyridine (10 μl), dried under vacuum, and the released methyl glycosides and corynomycolates derivatized in N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide + 1% trichloromethylsilane (50 μl; Pierce) for 1 h at 25 °C. Derivatized samples were analyzed by GC-TOF-MS (Agilent GC 6890N interfaced with a Leco PegasusIII TOF). GC was performed with a DB5-MS DG column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 250 μm film thickness) and the following oven temperature program: 1 min at 70 °C followed by a 12.5 °C/min temperature ramp to 295 °C and then a 25 °C/min ramp to 320 °C. Electron impact ionization was performed at 70 eV, an ion source temperature of 250 °C, and mass spectra were collected from 50 to 550 m/z. In some cases, the trehalose glycolipids were reduced with NaB2H4 prior to methanolysis. Glycolipids were resuspended in 50% 1-propanol containing NaB2H4 (20 mg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were acidified with glacial acetic acid and dried, and reduced glycolipids were recovered by phase partitioning in 1-butanol:water (1:2 v/v). For head group analysis, HPTLC-purified glycolipids were treated with base (0.1 m NaOH in methanol, 37 °C, 2 h) and the glycan moieties recovered in the aqueous phase after 1-butanol: water phase partitioning. The glycan fraction was desalted on a mixed bed ion exchange resin (AG-50-X50 (H+)/AG3 X12 (OH–), dried, and derivatized in N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + 1% trichloromethylsilane (50 μl) for 1 h at 25 °C, prior to analysis by GC-MS. Identification of New Cell Wall Biosynthesis Genes in Corynebacterineae—Our identification of potential reductase candidates formed part of a more general strategy to identify conserved cell wall biosynthesis genes. Because of the striking similarities between the cell wall components of mycobacteria and corynebacteria, we hypothesized that the majority of cell wall biosynthesis processes would be conserved between both genera. To identify new genes involved in these processes, we comprehensively referenced every putative open reading frame in the C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 Kitasato genome against the annotated genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv using the BLAST algorithm (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68351) Google Scholar). Conserved genes of unknown function that are essential or result in slow growth phenotypes when mutated in M. tuberculosis, as determined by the transposon mutagenesis studies of Sassetti et al. (12Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar), were considered to include candidates for cell wall biosynthesis genes of major structural components, because the vast majority of characterized cell wall genes are refractory to deletion or give rise to slow growing mutants when disrupted. Hence, we compacted the 2,993 predicted proteins of C. glutamicum to a list of only 83 that fulfilled these criteria. We then narrowed our search to focus on potential candidates for the conserved reductase proposed to function late in mycolic acid biosynthesis. Of the 80 uncharacterized genes found in M. tuberculosis with putative reductase domains (15Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd T. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Krogh A. McLean J. Moule S.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6406) Google Scholar), only two essential genes, Rv0561 and Rv2073c, and one gene, Rv2509, which results in a slow growth phenotype upon deletion, were conserved in C. glutamicum. Rv2073c was considered an unlikely candidate because it is absent from the highly decayed genome of Mycobacterium leprae, a species that despite a much reduced genome still synthesizes mycolic acids, and despite repeated attempts we were unable to delete the C. glutamicum orthologue of Rv0561c, suggesting that it encodes an essential function. The remaining candidate, Rv2509, is highly conserved in all sequenced genomes of the Corynebacterineae, including M. leprae (16Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D. Thomson N.R. Wheeler P.R. Honore N. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Mungall K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R.M. Devlin K. Duthoy S. Feltwell T. Fraser A. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Lacroix C. MacLean J. Moule S. Murphy L. Oliver K. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.-A. Rutherford K.M. Rutter S. Seeger K. Simon S. Simmonds M. Skelton J. Squares R. Squares S. Stevens K. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Woodward J.R. Barrell B.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). The homologues of Rv2509 in M. leprae and Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, and its orthologues in C. glutamicum and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, display 93, 94, 70, and 67% amino acid similarity, respectively, to the M. tuberculosis protein (Fig. 2). In the M. tuberculosis genome, Rv2509 is annotated as a 28-kDa putative short chain type dehydrogenase/reductase based on its amino acid sequence similarity to a range of reductases, the presence of an N-terminal TG(X)5G motif that represents a potential binding site for the cofactors NAD(H) or NADP(H), a putative active site YXXL motif at residues 157–161, and the presence of a number of other residues highly conserved in the short chain type reductase family (Fig. 2). Deletion of NCgl2385 in C. glutamicum Results in a Slow Growth Phenotype—To investigate whether Rv2509 is the reductase involved in mycolic motif formation, we deleted its orthologue in C. glutamicum, NCgl2385. A 344-bp segment internal to the gene was deleted using a two-step recombination strategy (see “Materials and Methods”). Potential mutants were screened first by PCR (data not shown), and disruption of the gene was confirmed by Southern blot hybridizations following digestions of genomic DNA with ClaI (Fig. 3, A and B). A probe derived from NCgl2385 hybridized to two fragments in the wild type parent strain of 1.2 and 1.7 kb in size and to one band in the mutant of 2.5 kb. This was the expected profile for a knock-out mutant because one ClaI site was located in the deleted portion of NCgl2385. The mutant grew as small colonies on solid media, and this slow growth phenotype was maintained in liquid media (Fig. 3C). Transformation of the ΔNCgl2385 mutant with the plasmid pSM22:NCgl2385, containing the entire NCgl2385 gene plus 241 bp of upstream sequence, restored a normal growth rate, whereas transformation with the empty pSM22 vector did not (Fig. 3C). The observed growth defect was consistent with the slow growth phenotype described for a M. tuberculosis Rv2509 knock-out strain (12Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar). The ΔNCgl2385 Mutant Produces Novel Forms of TDCM and TMCM and Is Deficient in Arabinogalactan-bound Corynomycolates—HPTLC analysis of noncovalently linked lipids and glycolipids extracted from wild type C. glutamicum and the ΔNCgl2385 mutant indicated that the two glycolipid species in the mutant, provisionally identified as modified TMCM and TDCM species (designated TMCM* and TDCM*), exhibited faster HPTLC mobilities than the wild type glycolipids (Fig. 4). The level of these faster migrating glycolipid species was also elevated in the mutant compared with wild type cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, the HPTLC mobility and levels of other glycolipids, including AcPIM2 and a novel species that may correspond to the recently characterized GlcA-diacylglycerol (32Tatituri R.V. Illarionov P.A. Dover L.G. Nigou J. Gilleron M. Hitchen P.G. Krumbach K. Morris H.R. Spencer N. Dell A. Eggeling L. Besra G.S. J. Biol.

To confirm that the faster migrating glycolipid species in the mutant were indeed distinct forms of TMCM and TDCM, these species were purified by HPTLC and subjected to compositional and MALDI-TOF analysis. Monosaccharide analysis showed that TMCM/TDCM from wild type cells and TMCM*/TDCM* from the ΔNCgl2385 mutant contained glucose as the only monosaccharide constituent. After mild base treatment and analysis of the released glycan head group by GC-MS, all species were found to contain comparable levels of trehalose (data not shown). When TMCM and TDCM from wild type cells were analyzed by MALDI-TOF in positive ion mode, a series of sodiated molecular ions were identified consistent with the presence of molecular species of TMCM and TDCM containing C32:0, C34:1, and C36:1 corynomycolates (Fig. 5). The corynomycolate composition was confirmed by GC-MS analysis (Fig. 6 and Fig. 8). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of the TMCM* and TDCM* species from the ΔNCgl2385 mutant revealed a similar cluster of sodiated molecular ions, although the mass of these species were 2 or 4 atomic mass units smaller than authentic TMCM and TDCM, respectively (Fig. 5). These mass differences could reflect an additional degree of unsaturation in the trehalose glycolipids of ΔNCgl2385 or the presence of an unreduced β-keto ester motif (see below). Following complementation of the ΔNCgl2385 mutant with a plasmid containing the NCgl2385 gene, the HPTLC mobility of trehalose glycolipids and levels of expression were indistinguishable from wild type cells (Fig. 4). The observed defect is thus because of loss of NCgl2385.FIGURE 5MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of C. glutamicum wild type (WT) and the ΔNCgl2385 mutant trehalose glycolipids.

The putative binding site for integrins has been mapped to the G domain of the α chain, although trimerization with β and γ chains is necessary for the G domain to exert its integrin binding activity. The mechanism underlying the requirement of β and γ chains in integrin binding by laminins remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the C-terminal region of the γ chain is involved in modulation of the integrin binding activity of laminins. We found that deletion of the C-terminal three but not two amino acids within the γ1 chain completely abrogated the integrin binding activity of laminin-511. Furthermore, substitution of Gln for Glu-1607, the amino acid residue at the third position from the C terminus of the γ1 chain, also abolished the integrin binding activity, underscoring the role of Glu-1607 in integrin binding by the laminin. We also found that the conserved Glu residue of the γ2 chain is necessary for integrin binding by laminin-332, suggesting that the same mechanism operates in the modulation of the integrin binding activity of laminins containing either γ1 or γ2 chains. However, the peptide segment modeled after the C-terminal region of γ1 chain was incapable of either binding to integrin or inhibiting integrin binding by laminin-511, making it unlikely that the Glu residue is directly recognized by integrin. These results, together, indicate a novel mechanism operating in ligand recognition by laminin binding integrins.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10643-10651Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 2Tryggvason K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 3Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). All laminins are large heterotrimeric glycoproteins composed of α, β, and γ chains that assemble into a cross-shaped structure. To date, five α chains (α1–α5), three β chains (β1–β3), and three γ chains (γ1–γ3) have been identified, combinations of which yield at least 15 isoforms with distinct subunit compositions (4Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Laminins contribute to basement membrane architecture and influence cell adhesion, spreading, and migration through binding to their cell surface receptors, particularly the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors (5Miner J.H.

Integrins play important roles in cell-matrix adhesion and signaling events regulating proliferation and differentiation of cells. Among the various integrin family members, α6β1, α6β4, α3β1, and α7β1 have been shown to be the major laminin receptors expressed in many cell types (10Nishiuchi R. Takagi J. Hayashi M. Ido H.

The G domain consists of five tandemly repeated LG modules of ∼200 amino acid residues, designated LG1 through LG5. By analogy with the identification of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) cell-adhesive motif in fibronectin, many attempts have been made to identify specific sequences mimicking the integrin binding activity of laminins. However, neither recombinant fragments of the G domain nor synthetic peptides modeled after the sequences in the G domain have shown any significant cell-adhesive activity comparable with that of intact laminins (15Yu H.

Previously, we found that deletion of the LG4-5 modules did not compromise the ability of laminin-511 4A new nomenclature of laminin isoforms (51Aumailley M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Carter W.G.

(α5β1γ1) to bind α3β1/α6β1 integrins, but further deletion up to the LG3 module resulted in the loss of its integrin binding ability (19Ido H. Harada K. Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Nishiuchi R. Natsuka Y.

These results indicate that the LG3 module is required for integrin binding by laminin-511, although LG4-5 modules are dispensable. Nevertheless, LG3 or other LG modules of the α5 chain did not exhibit any significant activity to bind the α6β1 integrin when recombinantly expressed alone or in tandem with adjacent modules (20Ido H. Harada K. Yagi Y. Sekiguchi K. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that G domain per se is not sufficient to recapitulate the integrin binding activity of laminins. Despite the importance of the G domain in the α chain, several lines of evidence indicate that heterotrimerization with β and γ chains is required for laminins to exert their integrin binding activities. Thus, the “E8 fragment” produced by brief elastase digestion of mouse laminin-111 retained almost the full activity of the parental molecule to mediate integrin-dependent cell-substratum adhesion but lost its activity when its α1 chain fragment containing LG1–3 modules was separated from the disulfide-linked β1-γ1 dimer fragment (21Deutzmann R. Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Pysny W. Timpl R. Edgar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cell adhesive activity was restored to the α1 chain fragment upon in vitro recombination and refolding with the β1-γ1 dimer (21Deutzmann R. Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Pysny W. Timpl R. Edgar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Sung U. O'Rear J.J. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1255-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The importance of heterotrimerization with the β and γ chains in the integrin binding activity of laminins has also been demonstrated with the recombinant E8 fragment of laminin-332, which was reconstructed by combining the α3 chain fragment containing LG1–3 modules with the disulfide-bonded β3-γ2 dimer segment (23Kunneken K. Pohlentz G. Schmidt-Hederich A. Odenthal U. Smyth N. Peter-Katalinic J. Bruckner P. Eble J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5184-5193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results indicate that not only the G domain of the α chain but also heterotrimerization of the α chain with the β and γ chains within their coiled-coil domains is required for integrin binding by laminins, although the molecular basis of the requirement for the β and γ chains remains to be elucidated. To address the role of β and γ chains in integrin binding by laminins, we focused on the putative interface between the G domain of the α chain and the heterotrimerized coiled-coil domains. The coiled-coil domain of mouse laminin-111 has been visualized by electron microscopy as cylinders (24Engel J. Odermatt E. Engel A. Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Rohde H. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 25Bruch M. Landwehr R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Antonsson P. Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Hanisch G. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); thus, it is conceivable that the C-terminal regions of the β and γ chains are in close proximity to and possibly interact with the G domain, thereby regulating the integrin binding activity of the G domain. Given the extension of nine amino acids in the γ1 chain against only one amino acid in the β1 chain, both of which are C-terminal to the conserved disulfide bond between the β1 and γ1 chains (Fig. 1A), we focused our attention on the role of the C-terminal 9-amino acid extension of the γ1 chain in integrin binding by laminin-511, a potent ligand for α6β1 and α3β1 integrins. In the present study we examined the integrin binding activities of a series of recombinant laminin-511 mutants with deletions or substitutions within the C-terminal region of the γ1 chain. Our results show that Glu-1607 at the third position from the C terminus is a prerequisite for laminin-511 recognition by integrins.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant laminin-511 mutants were produced using the Free-Style™ 293 Expression system (Invitrogen) and purified from conditioned media as described previously (19Ido H. Harada K. Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Nishiuchi R. Natsuka Y. Li S. Wada Y. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10946-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recombinant laminin-311 and laminin-332, both lacking LG4-5 modules, and their mutants were produced using the same expression system. The resultant conditioned media were applied to immunoaffinity columns conjugated with an anti-human laminin α3 mAb 2B10. The columns were washed with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), and bound laminins were eluted with 0.1 m triethylamine, neutralized, and dialyzed against TBS. Recombinant α6β1, α3β1, and αVβ3 integrins were produced using the same expression system and purified from the conditioned media using anti-FLAG columns (Sigma) described previously (20Ido H. Harada K. Yagi Y. Sekiguchi K. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The recombinant E8 fragment of laminin-511 and its mutants were produced using the Free-Style™ 293 Expression system. The conditioned media were applied to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity columns (Qiagen), and bound proteins were eluted with 200 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were further purified on anti-FLAG columns (Sigma). After dialysis against TBS, the purity of these recombinant proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or immunoblotting with anti-His tag (for α5E8), anti-hemagglutinin tag (for β1E8), or anti-FLAG tag (for γ1E8) mAbs. GST fusion proteins (GST-γ1(8AA), GST-RGD, and GST-RGE) were induced in Escherichia coli with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns (Amersham Biosciences) after lysis of the cells by sonication. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm glutathione. After dialysis against TBS, the purity of these recombinant proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or immunoblotting. Binding Assays for α6β1, α3β1, and αVβ3 Integrins—Solid-phase integrin binding assays of recombinant laminins, their mutants, or GST fusion proteins were performed using purified recombinant α6β1, α3β1, and αVβ3 integrins. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with recombinant proteins for testing at the indicated concentrations. The amounts of the recombinant proteins adsorbed on the plates were quantified with mAb 5D6 (for laminin-511, E8, and their mutants), mAb 2B10 (for laminin-311, laminin-332, and their mutants), or anti-GST antibody (for GST fusion proteins) to confirm the equality of the amounts of adsorbed proteins. After blocking with 3% BSA, plates were incubated with the 20 nm recombinant α6β1, α3β1, or αVβ3 integrin in the presence of 5 mm Mn2+ at 37 °C for 1 h. α6β1, α3β1, and αVβ3 integrins were used without proteolytic unclasping, since the binding of Mn2+ to the integrin can overcome the structural constraint imposed by an artificially introduced interchain disulfide bond (32Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). After washing with TBS containing 5 mm Mn2+ and 0.05% Tween 20, bound proteins were quantified after sequential incubations with the biotinylated anti-ACID/BASE antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (20Ido H. Harada K. Yagi Y. Sekiguchi K. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For integrin binding inhibition assays using function-blocking mAbs against integrin subunits or synthetic peptides, adhesive proteins coated on the microtiter plates were incubated with α6β1 integrin in the presence of mAbs (100 μg/ml) or γ1C or γ1C(EQ) peptide at 37 °C for 1 h before incubation with biotinylated anti-ACID/BASE antibody. Bound integrins were detected as described above. For determination of the apparent dissociation constants by saturation binding assays, plates were coated with laminins (5 nm). After blocking with BSA, serially diluted α6β1 integrin was added to the plates, and bound integrin was quantified. The apparent dissociation constants were determined as described previously (34Nishiuchi R. Murayama O. Fujiwara H. Gu J. Kawakami T. Aimoto S. Wada Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion assays were performed as described previously (19Ido H. Harada K. Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Nishiuchi R. Natsuka Y. Li S. Wada Y. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10946-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using K562 human leukemia cells transfected with cDNA encoding an α6 integrin subunit (kindly provided by Dr. Arnoud Sonnenberg, The Netherland Cancer Institute, Amsterdam). The cells were maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and used without pretreatment with Mn2+ to fully activate integrins. After fixation with formaldehyde and subsequent staining with Diff-Quik (International Reagents Corp., Kobe, Japan), attached cells were counted in three independent wells using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Deletion of the C-terminal Region of the γ1 Chain Abrogates Integrin Binding Activity—To address the potential involvement of the C-terminal region of the γ1 chain in integrin binding by laminin, we produced a mutant laminin-511 in which the C-terminal eight amino acids were deleted from the γ1 chain (designated LN511-γ1Δ8AA; see Fig. 1A). The mutant laminin-511 also lacked the LG4-5 modules that are required for α-dystroglycan binding but not for integrin binding (19Ido H. Harada K. Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Nishiuchi R. Natsuka Y. Li S. Wada Y. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10946-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A recombinant laminin-511 containing an intact γ1 chain and the α5 chain deleted of LG4-5 (designated LN511-γ1) was used as a control laminin-511 throughout this study. The authenticity of the recombinant proteins as well as other mutant laminin-511 proteins with deletions or amino acid substitutions (see below) was verified by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1B). Under reducing conditions, the recombinant proteins gave three bands upon Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, one corresponding to the α5 chain lacking LG4-5 modules and two lower bands corresponding to the β1 chain and intact or mutant γ1 chains, the latter specifically detected by immunoblotting with a mAb against the γ1 chain (Fig. 1B). Under nonreducing conditions, LN511-γ1 and its deletion mutants gave a slowly migrating band near the top of the gel, confirming that they were purified as trimers of the α5, β1, and γ1 chains. Solid-phase binding assays with the α6β1 integrin showed that the control laminin-511 (LN511-γ1) was fully active in binding to the α6β1 integrin, whereas the mutant laminin-511 lacking the C-terminal eight amino acids of the γ1 chain (LN511-γ1Δ8AA) exhibited only marginal activity comparable with that of another mutant laminin-511 lacking the LG3–5 modules of the α5 chain (designated ΔLG3–5; Fig. 2A), which have been shown to be devoid of integrin binding activity (19Ido H. Harada K. Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Nishiuchi R. Natsuka Y. Li S. Wada Y. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10946-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because LN511-γ1 and LN511-γ1Δ8AA have common α5 and β1 subunits, the significant reduction in integrin binding activity would be ascribable to the deletion of C-terminal eight amino acids in the γ1 chain, indicating its involvement in integrin binding by laminin-511. To narrow down the amino acid residues involved in integrin binding, we produced a series of mutant laminin-511 with shorter deletions within the C-terminal region of the γ1 chain and examined their integrin binding activities (Fig. 1A). Mutant laminin-511 lacking the C-terminal 1 or 2 amino acids (designated LN511-γ1Δ1AA and LN511-γ1Δ2AA, respectively) retained the integrin binding activity but were less active than control laminin-511 (Fig. 2A). Reduced integrin binding affinity of these deletion mutants was confirmed by determination of apparent dissociation constants by saturation integrin binding assays; the estimated dissociation constants of LN511-γ1Δ1AA and LN511-γ1Δ2AA for α6β1 integrin were 2.4 ± 0.41 and 2.2 ± 1.4 nm, respectively, ∼5-fold lower than that of control laminin-511 (Kd, 0.43 ± 0.1 nm) (Fig. 3). Further deletion up to the third amino acid residue, i.e. Glu-1607, resulted in a significant abrogation of the integrin binding activity of laminin-511. A dramatic loss of the integrin binding activity upon deletion of the C-terminal three but not two amino acids from the γ1 chain indicated that Glu-1607 at the third position from the C terminus played a critical role in the potent integrin binding by laminin-511. To address the role of the Glu-1607 in integrin binding by laminin-511, we produced a mutant laminin-511 in which Glu-1607 of the γ1 chain was replaced with glutamine (designated LN511-γ1EQ; see Fig. 1A). As expected, the laminin-511 with E1607Q substitution was almost devoid of integrin binding activity (Fig. 2B), confirming the importance of Glu-1607 in integrin binding by laminin-511.

https://openalex.org/W2027736770,"Color observations from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal zones of localized fluid alteration (cementation and bleaching) along joints within layered deposits in western Candor Chasma, Mars. This fluid alteration occurred within the subsurface in the geologic past and has been exposed at the surface through subsequent erosion. These findings demonstrate that fluid flow along fractures was a mechanism by which subsurface fluids migrated through these layered deposits. Fractured layered deposits are thus promising sites for investigating the geologic history of water on Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2027305286,"The anoxic metabolism of the ubiquitous triterpene cholesterol is challenging because of its complex chemical structure, low solubility in water, low number of active functional groups, and the presence of four alicyclic rings and two quaternary carbon atoms. Consequently, the aerobic metabolism depends on oxygenase catalyzed reactions requiring molecular oxygen as co-substrate. Sterolibacterium denitrificans is shown to metabolize cholesterol anoxically via the oxidation of ring A, followed by an oxygen-independent hydroxylation of the terminal C-25 of the side chain.

The anaerobic hydroxylation of a tertiary carbon using water as oxygen donor is unprecedented and may be catalyzed by a novel molybdenum containing enzyme. Isoprenoids constitute an extremely large and diverse group of natural compounds. They are built up from one or more five-carbon units, active derivatives of isoprene. The family includes triterpenes, such as cholesterol and diploptene; diterpenes, such as abietic acid, which is an important constituent of plant resins and constitutes the largest pool of diterpenes in nature; plant growth hormones; insect juvenile hormones; and many more compounds (1Mathews C.K. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry.2nd Ed. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., Menlo Park, CA1996: 678-680Google Scholar). Among them cholesterol is ubiquitous (Fig. 1). This sterol is present in the membranes of most eukaryotes and serves as precursor to steroid hormones, vitamin D, and the bile acids. Many bacterial membranes most tain hopanoids, similar pentacyclic sterol-like molecules. The complete aerobic mineralization of cholesterol by various genera of bacteria, such as Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pseudomonas, and Rhodococcus has been studied in some detail (2Kieslich K. J. Basic Microbiol. 1985; 25: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Owen R.W. Mason A.N. Bilton R.F. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1500-1511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). This interest is due to the biotechnological applications of sterol transforming enzymes with high regioand stereo-specificity in industrial sexual hormone synthesis (4Jin C.J. Mackenzie P.I. Miners J.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The aerobic metabolism of cholesterol 1 starts with oxidation to cholest-4-en-3-one 2 by NAD(P)+- or FAD+-dependent cholesterol dehydrogenase, with the reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (5Horinouchi S. Ishizuka H. Beppu T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This enzyme was studied in detail because of its importance in clinical applications (7Cheetham P.S.J. Dunnill P. Lilly M.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J.

Biol. 2000; 72: 169-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The side chain is then degraded via hydroxylation, two turns of β-oxidation and one retroaldol-reaction. Following degradation of the side chain, the ring system is cleaved and degraded. Ring A is oxidized to a phenol unit which is split by a meta-cleavage dioxygenase. At least four transformations that require molecular oxygen as a co-substrate reportedly occur during the mineralization of cholesterol. In contrast very little is known about the mechanisms that operate under anoxic conditions. It is obvious that anoxic metabolism involves unprecedented, oxygen-independent steps. The best studied anoxic reactions so far involve the incomplete transformation of cholesterol. The double bond in cholesterol is reduced to form coprostanol by intestinal fermentative bacteria (11Freier T.A. Beitz D.C. Li L. Hartman P.A. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), either directly by cholesterol reductase or via an alternative indirect pathway (12Li L. Freier T.A. Hartman P.A. Young J.W. Beitz D.C. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 887-892Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Many strictly anaerobic cholesterol-reducing bacteria have been isolated and characterized from the gut contents of mammals (13Eyssen H.J. Parmentier G.G. Compernolle F.C. De Pauw G.

Microbiol. 1982; 43: 86-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were found to belong to the genus Eubacterium. Furthermore, intestinal bacteria can transform cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into 15–20 different bile acid metabolites (16Hayakawa S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1973; 11: 143-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Well known transformations include deconjugation of bile acids, dehydrogenation of hydroxyl groups at the C-7 position, reduction of oxo bile acids, and dehydroxylation of bile acids. In all cases studied so far, the cyclic carbon rings remain intact. Some nitrate-reducing β-Proteobacteria were isolated on oxygen containing or unsaturated monoterpenes as sole carbon source and electron donor, including Thauera spp. (17Foss S. Harder J. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1998; 21: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and Alcaligenes spp. (18Heyen U. Harder J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The biotransformation of monoterpenes, bile acids, and other isoprenoids in anaerobic ecosystems was recently reviewed (19Hylemon P.B. Harder J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 475-488Crossref Google Scholar). In all cases studied, denitrifyers completely oxidize their isoprenoid substrates to CO2. So far, only two denitrifying bacterial strains related to the genera Thauera and Azoarcus (β-subclass of the Proteobacteria) (20Harder J. Probian C. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Tarlera S. Denner E.B.M. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2003; 53: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were obtained that can grow under anoxic and oxic conditions with cholesterol as sole carbon and energy source. Anoxic metabolism of cholesterol is mechanistically interesting since this triterpene is intrinsically difficult to attack due to its complex chemical structure, low solubility in water, low number of active functional groups, and the presence of four alicyclic rings and two quaternary carbon atoms (Fig. 1). Cholesterol and related sterols are thus important biological markers in studying the biological origin and geological fate of organic compounds (22Mackenzie A.S. Brassell S.C. Eglinton G. Maxwell J.R. Science. 1982; 217: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 23Wakeham S.G. Nature. 1989; 342: 787-790Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study we propose the initial steps in anoxic cholesterol metabolic pathway using Sterolibacterium denitrificans as a model organism (Fig. 2B). [4C-14C]Cholesterol was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc./Biotrend Chemikalien GmbH (Köln, Germany). 18O2 (99 atom %) and 18O-labeled water (97 atom %) were obtained from Campro Scientific GmbH (Berlin, Germany). The chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), or Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). S. denitrificans Chol-1ST (= DSMZ13999) (21Tarlera S. Denner E.B.M. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2003; 53: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany). S. denitrificans was grown anaerobically at 30 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The gas phase (headspace) consisted of nitrogen gas. Large scale cultivation was performed in a 200-liter fermentor. The medium contained in 1 liter of distilled water: 0.5 g of NH4Cl, 0.5 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g CaCl2·2H2O, and 0.85 g of NaNO3 (10 mm). After autoclaving sterile 50 ml of KH2PO4 solution (10 g l ml l–1) (26Tschech A. Pfenning N. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 137: 163-167Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar) were added. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 with 2 n HCl. NaNO3 was added continuously to 10 mm when the terminal electron acceptor added initially (10 mm NaNO3) was consumed. 2.5 mm cholesterol was added to the growth medium as sole carbon and energy source. Cells were harvested by centrifugation in the exponential growth phase at A578 nm of 0.8 to 1.0 (optical path 1 cm) and then stored at –70 °C. In a small scale fed-batch culture (100 ml), S. denitrificans cells were incubated with 2.5 mm cholesterol under denitrifying conditions, to which [4C-14C]-cholesterol (2 × 107 dpm) was added as tracer. After different time intervals of incubation (0, 11, 26, 33, 50, 59, and 75 h) samples were withdrawn from the culture, and the following factors were quantified: the growth of bacterial cells (A578 nm), the residual amount of nitrate and cholesterol in the medium, the amount of 14C remained in the growth medium, and 14C assimilated in the biomass. The separation of S. denitrificans cells from residual cholesterol by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min) was not successful. Therefore, the culture samples (1 ml) were extracted with the same volume of ethyl acetate three times to isolate the remained [4C-14C]cholesterol from the water fraction containing the biomass. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) the biomass including cell debris and lipid remained in the water phase and interface, whereas [4C-14C]cholesterol remained in the ethyl acetate phase. The collected ethyl acetate fraction was evaporated, and the residue was re-dissolved in 1 ml of ethanol. The amount of 14C remained in 1 ml water fraction (mainly the assimilated biomass) and 14C extracted by ethyl acetate and re-dissolved in 1 ml ethanol (mainly the remained [4C-14C]cholesterol) was determined as described later. All steps used for preparation of cell extracts were performed at 4 °C under anoxic conditions. Frozen cells were suspended in twice the volume of 20 mm MOPS 2The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; DCPIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CI, chemical ionization; EI, electron impact; ESI, electrospray ionization; S1, cholest-5-en-3-one; S2, cholest-4-en-3-one; S3, cholesta-1,4-dien-3-one; S4, 25-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one; S5, 25-hydroxycholesta-1,4-dien-3-one. -K+ buffer (pH 7.9) containing 0.1 mg of DNase I ml–1. Cells were broken by passing the cell suspension through a French pressure cell (American Instruments, Silver Spring, MD) twice at 137 megapascals. The cell lysate was fractionated by two steps of centrifugation: the first step involved a centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g to get rid of the cell debris, unbroken cells, and residual cholesterol. The supernatant (crude cell extract) was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h to separate soluble proteins from membrane proteins. Assays were routinely performed under anoxic conditions at 30 °C for 16 h under a nitrogen gas phase. The assay mixtures (0.3 ml) for producing intermediates S1, S2, and S3 contained soluble proteins (5 mg) extracted from S. denitrificans cells grown anoxically on cholesterol, 20 mm MOPS-K+ buffer (pH 7.9), 5 mm NAD+, and 0.2 mm [4C-14C]cholesterol (120,000 dpm). For producing intermediates S1, S2, and S3 in large scale, the reaction mixture was enlarged to 300 ml. Electron acceptor specificity was tested by using the following electron acceptors (5 mm) at 0.2 mm [4C-14C]cholesterol (120,000 dpm): NaNO3, K3[Fe(CN)6], NAD+, NADP+, phenazine methosulphate, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), methylene blue, and duroquinone. The large scale assay for the production of intermediates S4 and S5 was performed as follows: 300 ml of soluble proteins extracted from S. denitrificans cells were precipitated at 25% ammonium sulfate saturation at 4 °C. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min) the pellet (220 mg of total protein) was dissolved in 100 ml of 20 mm MOPS-K+ buffer (pH 7.9), and then 5 mm K3[Fe(CN)6] and 0.5 mm cholest-4-en-3-one were added as artificial electron acceptor and substrate, respectively. To produce S4 and S5 in large amounts, K3[Fe(CN)6], instead of DCPIP, was used, although DCPIP was a better artificial electron acceptor. The large amount of this electron acceptor that remained after water-ethyl acetate partition in both phases heavily hindered the further purification of products. In small scale assays [4C-14C]cholesterol was added as the tracer to locate the products by autoradiography. However, to avoid interference in mass spectral analysis, no [4C-14C]cholesterol was used in large scale mixtures. To test whether the hydroxyl group at C-25 of 25-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one (S4) and 25-hydroxycholesta-1,4-dien-3-one (S5) originates from water or from molecular oxygen, three in vitro assays were performed. The three reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h under shaking. The products S4 and S5 were purified from the assays and then analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry as described later. 1)18O2-treated Assay—17.5 ml of 18O2 gas was introduced into an anaerobic glass bottle containing 70 ml of headspace (95% N2 and 5% H2, 1 atm) and 50 ml of reaction mixture. The final 18O2 concentration in the headspace was ∼20%. The 50-ml reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS-K+ buffer (pH 7.9), the soluble protein fraction (60 mg of total protein) precipitated at 25% ammonium sulfate saturation, and 5 mm K3[Fe(CN)6] was prepared in an anaerobic glove box before the introduction of 18O2 gas. After the addition of 18O2 gas, 2.5 ml of a 10 mm cholest-4-en-3-one solution in 2-propanol was added to the reaction mixture (final concentration 0.5 mm).2)18O-Labeled Water-treated Assay—3 ml of 66 mm MOPS-K+ buffer (pH 7.9) and 7 ml of 18O-labeled water were mixed and used to re-suspend the pellet obtained after ammonium sulfate precipitation (25% saturation) of cell extract (soluble fraction containing 30 mg of protein). The reaction was started by adding 5 mm K3[Fe(CN)6] and 0.5 mm cholest-4-en-3-one to the anoxic assay. The final 18O-water content was ∼66%.3)Control Experiment—50 ml of reaction mixture containing the same components as those of 18O2-treated assay was used to which no 18O2 gas was introduced into the headspace. Quantification of cholesterol was carried out by using the o-phthaldialdehyde method (27Rudell L.L. Morris M.D. J. Lipid Res. 1973; 14: 364-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Culture samples of 1 ml were extracted twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. After evaporation of ethyl acetate under vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 2 ml of glacial acetic acid containing 1 mg of o-phthaldialdehyde. After 10 min at room temperature, 1 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added and immediately mixed. After further incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the absorbance was measured photometrically at 590 nm. Nitrate was determined by the 2,6-dimethylphenol photometric method. 0.2-ml samples (containing 0.02–0.08 μmol of nitrate) were mixed with 0.2 ml of solution A (10 mg ml–1 sulfamic acid in water) and 1.6 ml of solution B (85% H3PO4-98% H2SO4 (1:1, v/v)). After 10 min, 0.2 ml of solution C (12 mg ml–1 2,6-dimethylphenol in glacial acetic acid) was added to the mixtures. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the concentration of nitrate was measured photometrically at 334 nm. The amount of 14C in liquid samples (1 ml) was determined by liquid scintillation counting using 3 ml of Rotiszint 2200 scintillation mixture (Roth). The counting efficiency was determined via the channel ratio method. Products were first extracted twice by equal volume of ethyl acetate, and the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction was concentrated under vacuum. The standards and extracted products were separated on silica gel aluminum TLC plates (Silica gel 60 F254, thickness, 0.2 mm, 20 by 20 cm; Merck). The following solvent system was used: n-hexane-ethyl acetate (65:35, v/v). The compounds were visualized under UV light at 254 nm or by spraying the TLC plates with concentrated H2SO4. The 14C-labeled products were localized by autoradiography with a phosphorimaging plate (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan). The following systems were used for separation, isolation, and identification of standards and products formed from cholesterol. (i)System 1—For isolation and identification of products S1, S2, and S3, an analytical RP-C18 column (LiChrospher 100, end capped, 5 μm, 120 by 4 mm; Merck) was used with a flow rate of 0.8 ml min–1 at room temperature. The mobile phase comprised a mixture of two solvents: A (30% (v/v) acetonitrile) and B (80% (v/v) 2-propanol). The separation was performed with a linear gradient of solvent B from 80 to 90% within 30 min. Standards and 14C-labeled products were detected by using two detectors (UV at 210 or 240 nm and a flow-through radioactivity detector with a solid scintillation cell connected to the HPLC system) in series.(ii)System 2—The column and detectors used for isolation of product M1 was the same as described in system 1. The separation was performed isocratically with 90% (v/v) 2-propanol as an eluent and a flow rate of 0.8 ml min–1.(iii)System 3—An analytical RP-C18 column (Luna 18(2), 5 μm, 150 by 4.6 mm; Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) was used for isolation of products S4 and S5. Solvents A and B in the mobile phase and the detectors were the same as described for system 1. The separation was performed with a linear gradient of solvent B from 40% to 70% within 30 min and a flow rate of 0.8 ml min–1 at room temperature. Standards and HPLC-purified products were dissolved in acetonitrile in the range between 10–100 μg ml–1. UV absorption spectra of these compounds were obtained by using a lambda 2S UV/VIS spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Rodgau-Jügesheim, Germany). Chemical ionization (CI)-mass and electron impact (EI)-mass spectra were recorded with a Thermo Finnigan TSQ700 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a direct inlet probe (Thermo Electron, Dreieich, Germany). The ionizing energy and source temperature of EI-mass spectrometric measurements were 70 eV and 180 °C, respectively. The measurements of CI-mass spectra were operating in positive ion mode at 130 eV ionizing energy and ammonia was used as the reagent gas. ESI-mass spectra were recorded with a Applied Biosystems API 2000 triple quadrupole instrument running in positive ion mode. Experiments were performed using an Agilent 1100 LC binary pump connected directly to the interface. The flow rate was 0.2 ml min–1 (methanol-10 mm ammonium acetate (90:10, v/v)). The source temperature was maintained at 375 °C. Positive ion ESI was carried out at 5,500 V, with declustering potential of 100 V, focusing potential of 300 V, and entrance potential of 10 V. Unit resolution was used with a step size of 0.1 amu in the range of 80–500 atomic mass unit. Acquisition methods were performed using the Analyst software, version 1.4.1. (Applied Biosystems). NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX-spectrometer at 27 °C. Chemical shifts δ were recorded and reported in ppm relative to CHCl3 (1H: δ = 7.26) and CDCl3 (13C: δ = 77.0) as internal standard. Denitrifying Growth of S. denitrificans with [4C-14C]-Cholesterol—It is well known that some fermentative bacteria can transform cholesterol under anoxic conditions to derivatives such as coprostanol (11Freier T.A. Beitz D.C. Li L. Hartman P.A. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Li L. Freier T.A. Hartman P.A. Young J.W. Beitz D.C. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 887-892Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Such transformation reactions are limited to changes of functional groups but the ring system of the substrate is not attacked. To test whether S. denitrificans oxidizes cholesterol completely to CO2, we incubated this strain in chemically defined medium with cholesterol as the carbon source and nitrate as an electron acceptor. After different intervals of incubation, the residual amount of cholesterol that remained in the medium and the amount that was assimilated into the biomass was measured. To facilitate the measurements, [4C-14C]cholesterol (200,000 dpm ml–1) was added to the growth medium (100 ml) as tracer. As shown in Fig. 3, bacterial growth (measured as the increase of the optical density) was accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of cholesterol and in the total radioactivity. Furthermore, bacterial growth was accompanied by accumulation of radioactive 14C in the biomass. The results clearly indicate the ability of S. denitrificans to degrade 14C-labeled cholesterol to volatile CO2 and to assimilate the carbon atoms from the ring system of cholesterol. Actually, the results conform well with the theoretical stoichiometry for anoxic cholesterol mineralization under denitrifying conditions (21Tarlera S. Denner E.B.M. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2003; 53: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which follows the equation (for explanation, see legend to Fig. 3): C27H46O+30.4NO3-+30.4H+→27CO2+15.2N2+38.2H2O. Transformation of [4C-14C]Cholesterol by Cell Extracts of S. denitrificans—To identify potential intermediates of anaerobic cholesterol metabolism, high density cell suspensions of S. denitrificans were incubated with [4C-14C]cholesterol and sodium nitrate. After different time intervals the mixture was analyzed by TLC and autoradiography. At least one 14C-labeled product (S3) was detected, and the amount of this product increased with time. The Rf value and retention time of this product matched exactly with those of the authentic cholesta-1,4-dien-3-one sample (data not shown). To obtain more information, in vitro transformation of [4C-14C]cholesterol under anoxic conditions was studied. Crude cell extract was fractionated by ultracentrifugation into soluble protein and membrane-bound protein fraction, and all three fractions were incubated with 0.2 mm [4C-14C]cholesterol and 5 mm NAD+ in 100 mm MOPS-K+ buffer. Samples were analyzed by TLC and autoradiography. The maximal synthesis of labeled products by the soluble protein fraction occurred at pH 7.9, whereas the membrane protein fraction produced different compound(s) only at pH 6.5 (data not shown). At pH 7.9, at least six radioactive spots were observed some of which were very weak (Fig. 4). Crude extract produced mainly a compound designated S3, which was also observed with whole cells. When the soluble protein fraction was incubated with NAD+, next to product S3 two other dominant products designated S1 and S2 appeared. The membrane-bound protein fraction alone did not produce products S1-S3. However, one fast migrating product designated M1 was formed in large amount at pH 6.5. Formation of products from [4C-14C]cholesterol by the soluble protein fraction also occurred when other electron acceptors were added instead of NAD+ (Fig. 5). K3[Fe(CN)6] and phenazine methosulfate yielded two slowly migrating products, S4 and S5, besides small amounts of S3, whereas DCPIP produced mostly S4. The soluble protein fraction was then fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Maximal amounts of S4 and S5 were produced with the 25% ammonium sulfate saturation fraction (pH 7.9, 5 mm K3[Fe(CN)6]). According to Kieslich’s report (2Kieslich K. J. Basic Microbiol. 1985; 25: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), in oxic cholesterol degradation pathway the side chain of cholesterol is degraded via oxygen-dependent side chain hydroxylation, β-oxidation, and retroaldol reaction, and some intermediates with a carboxylic group in the side chain were observed (Fig. 2A). We acidified the reaction mixtures of in vitro assays to pH 2 before the products were extracted by water-ethyl acetate partition, but no acidic products were found. In addition, we also added Mg-ATP and coenzyme A to reaction mixtures of in vitro assays to enable CoA-thioester formation, but no new products were observed (data not shown). Products S1–S5 and M1 were also observed when the in vitro assays were performed under oxic conditions (data not shown), indicating that the initial enzymes of the anaerobic process are not inhibited by oxygen. Identification and Structure Elucidation of Products Derived from Cholesterol—Products (M1, S1–S5) resulting from cholesterol transformation were extracted with ethyl acetate and purified by TLC and subsequent HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). The products S1–S3 were identified by reference to TLC, HPLC mobility, and UV absorption of authentic standards. The identification of S4 and S5 relies mainly on mass and NMR spectra. Rf value, retention time, UV absorption maximum, and molecular weight (determined by CI-mass spectrometry) of HPLC-purified products, and authentic standards are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1TLC, HPLC, UV absorption, and CI-mass behavior of HPLC-purified products and authentic compoundsCompoundsTLC behavior (Rf value)HPLC behavior (room temperature)UV absorption maximumMr measured by CI-massminnmM10.7718.6 ± 0.3< 210368Authentic cholesta-3,5-diene (Mr 368)0.7315.4 ± 0.2235S10.5026.5 ± 0.4< 210384Authentic cholest-5-en-3-one (Mr 384)0.5026.7 ± 0.4< 210S20.3823.3 ± 0.2238384Authentic cholest-4-en-3-one (Mr 384)0.3823.1 ± 0.3238S30.2915.1 ± 0.3243382S40.1321.6 ± 0.4238400S50.0917.1 ± 0.2243398 Open table in a new tab CI-mass spectrum of S1 revealed a molecular mass of 384 Da. The maximal ultraviolet absorption near 200 nm suggested the absence of a conjugated double bond structure. UV absorption pattern, retention time, and Rf value of this compound matched exactly with those of authentic cholest-5-en-3-one (Table 1). According to CI-mass spectrum of S2, its molecular weight was also 384 Da. Yet, the maximal ultraviolet absorption at 238 nm indicated the presence of a conjugated double bond system. In addition, retention time and Rf value of this compound matched exactly with those of authentic cholest-4-en-3-one (Table 1). For product S3, the maximal ultraviolet absorption at 243 nm is likely due to the presence of a conjugated double bond structure. The CI-mass spectrum suggested that its molecular mass was 382 Da (Table 1). The EI-mass spectrum of S3 (see supplemental Fig. S1) with a dominant fragment ion peak at m/z 122 matched exactly with that of cholesta-1,4-dien-3-one in a spectral data base for organic compounds (SDBS). Note that the dominant fragment ion peak for product S2 was m/z 124, not m/z 122 (see supplemental Fig. S1). The difference in EI-mass spectra is due to the difference in ring A system between S2 and S3 (S3 has an additional C=C structure in C-1 position). According to the result of CI-mass spectrum, the molecular mass of product S4 was 400 Da (Table 1). The absence of molecular ion peak and the presence of a dominant M-18 peak (loss of H2O) in the EI-mass spectrum (see supplemental Fig. S1) suggested the potential existence of a tertiary hydroxyl group. In addition, a characteristic fragment ion peak at m/z 124 in EI-mass spectrum and the identical UV absorption maximum at 238 nm (Table 1) suggested product S4 was closely similar to S2 in ring A system. The CI-mass spectrum of S5 indicated its molecular weight was 398 Da. No molecular ion peak, but a dominant M-18 peak, appeared in EI-mass spectrum of S5 (see supplemental Fig. S1). This situation was identical to that of product S4. The dominant fragment ion peak at m/z 122 and maximal UV absorption at 243 nm matched well with those of S3. The results suggested that product S5 was identical to S3 in ring A structure. The exact structures of S4 and S5 were further elucidated by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 6 and Table 2). 1H and 13C NMR spectra of S4 were almost identical with the ones of cholest-4-en-3-one with the exception of the chemical shifts for the C-26, C-27 methyl groups (proton NMR), and C-25 (13C NMR). For cholest-4-en-3-one the C-26, C-27 methyl groups are observed as d at 0.86 ppm. For S4, the signal for CH3-26, 27 is observed as a singlet at 1.24 ppm (Fig. 6). A downfield shift is observed in the 13C NMR spectrum (71.04 ppm versus 22.77 ppm for cholest-4-en-3-one) for the C-25 signal of S4. This is in agreement with a heteroatom substituent like a hydroxyl group at C-25.TABLE 213C NMR spectral data for S2, S4, and S5 in CDCl3δc (S2)δc (S4)δc (S5)ppm199.52199.62186.43171.57171.63169.44123.70123.71156.0"

It is well established that they are like the endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), which are the main amphiphilic components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, potent stimulants of the human innate immune system, and elicit a variety of proinflammatory immune responses. Investigations of synthetic lipopeptides corresponding to N-terminal partial structures of bacterial lipoproteins defined the chemical prerequisites for their biological activity and in particular the number and length of acyl chains and sequence of the peptide part. Here we present experimental data on the biophysical mechanisms underlying lipopeptide bioactivity. Investigation of selected synthetic diacylated and triacylated lipopeptides revealed that the geometry of these molecules (i.e. the molecular conformations and supramolecular aggregate structures) and the preference for membrane intercalation provide an explanation for the biological activities of the different lipopeptides. This refers in particular to the agonistic or antagonistic activity (i.e. their ability to induce cytokines in mononuclear cells or to block this activity, respectively). Biological activity of lipopeptides was hardly affected by the LPS-neutralizing antibiotic polymyxin B, and the biophysical interaction characteristics were found to be in sharp contrast to that of LPS with polymyxin B. The analytical data show that our concept of “endotoxic conformation,” originally developed for LPS, can be applied also to the investigated lipopeptide and suggest that the molecular mechanisms of cell activation by amphiphilic molecules are governed by a general principle.

Like LPS these molecules can be potent activators of lymphocytes and macrophages and give danger signals to the infected host (6Melchers F. Braun V. Galanos C. J. Exp.

A variety of biological activities have been described for native LP as well as for synthetic LP based on the highly conserved lipopeptide moiety of Braun's lipoprotein derived from Escherichia coli (8Braun V. Wolff H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The innate immune system plays an essential role in the host defense against bacterial infection. Recognition of bacterial virulence factors is mandatory for the initiation of an inflammatory and anti-bacterial immune response. Bacterial compounds such as LPS and lipoproteins are recognized by type I transmembrane proteins of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (9Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Of the more than 10 known TLRs, several have been found to participate in the recognition of microbial infections. TLR4 initiates cell activation by LPS in concert with the extracellular protein MD-2 (10Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C.

Together with Dectin-1, it recognizes infections by yeasts (27Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Canavera S.J. Akira S. Underhill D.M. J. Exp.

As far as the structural prerequisites for bioactivity of lipopeptides are concerned, it has been shown that tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-l-Cys-Ser-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys (Pam3CSK4) was highly active, whereas the natural dipeptide part of the outer membrane lipoprotein, tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-l-Cys-Ser (Pam3CS), only has a low activity (34Bessler W.G. Cox M. Lex A. Suhr B. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1900-1905PubMed Google Scholar, 35Prass W. Ringsdorf H. Bessler W. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is known for many amphiphilic molecules like phospholipids and glycolipids that physical parameters are strong determinants of biological activity. Above a certain threshold concentration, i.e. the critical micellar concentration, these molecules form aggregates in aqueous dispersions, which may adopt different phase states as follows: an ordered gel phase, where the acyl chains are in the all-trans (zig-zag) conformation, and a liquid crystalline phase, where the chains are disordered as a result of the introduction of gauche conformers. Between these phases a reversible first order transition takes place at a lipid-specific temperature. Furthermore, the type of aggregate structure, uni- and multilamellar, cubic direct or inverted, hexagonal HI or inverted HII, may play a decisive role in biological systems (36Israelachvili J.N. Intermolecular and Surface Forces.2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1991: 366-394Google Scholar). It has been shown for LPS and its lipid moiety, lipid A, the endotoxic principle of LPS (37Rietschel E.T.

For lipopeptides, only for the immunoadjuvants Pam3-l-Cys and Pam3-l-Cys-Ser, experimental data are available, indicating that these molecules form vesicular or tubular aggregates of different sizes in aqueous dispersion depending on the configuration of the glycerol moiety and the head group (40Reichel F.

Furthermore, two Pam3Cys-peptides LP1 and LP2, characterized by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, form large and highly heterogeneous aggregates where the smaller aggregates were shown to have higher bioactivity. 3A.

To clarify the correlation between physicochemical characteristics and biological activities, we have investigated three selected lipopeptides with different cytokine-inducing activity, with strong agonistic as well as antagonistic activity in human mononuclear cells. We have found that as in the case of endotoxins, the types of aggregate structures are important determinants of cytokine-inducing activity. Furthermore, we show that our concept of “endotoxic conformation,” which was shown to be applicable so far not only to LPS but also to particular synthetic phospholipids (41Seydel U. Hawkins L.

Heine H. Koch M.H.J. Seydel U. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), can also be extended to the lipopeptides. In addition, we present data showing that a biologically inactive lipopeptide, which antagonizes cell activation by biologically active lipopeptides, is also able to antagonize cell activation by LPS, supporting the broad validity of the conformation concept for agonistic as well as antagonistic activity. Synthesis—Pam2CSK4 and Pam3CSK4 were synthesized and analyzed by EMC microcollections GmbH according to published procedures (43Metzger J. Wiesmuller K.H. Schaude R. Bessler W.G. Jung G. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 37: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 44Wiesmueller K.H. Bessler W.G. Jung G. Int. J. Pept.

Wiesmueller K.H. Jung G. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1754-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The structural formula of the synthetic compounds dipalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-l-Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (Pam2CSK4), tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-l-Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (Pam3CSK4), and of the lipolanthionine peptide (2R,6R)-Pam2LanHda-Ser-(Lys)4-NH2 (lipolan) are shown in Fig. 1. The stereochemistry and composition of the lipid tails of lipolan have been optimized for the inhibition of TLR2-dependent IL-8 induction by Pam3CSK4 in myelomonocytic THP-1 cells (46Seyberth T. Voss S. Brock R. Wiesmueller K.H. Jung G. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1754-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reagents—Deep rough mutant LPS (Re LPS) was extracted from Salmonella enterica sv. Minnesota strain R595 according to the phenol/chloroform/petrol ether procedure (47Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The LPS preparation was lyophilized and used in the natural salt form. The chemical purity of the LPS preparation was confirmed by mass spectrometry. LPS was suspended in PBS (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) by thorough vortexing. The suspensions were temperature-cycled at least twice between 4 and 56 °C, each cycle being followed by intense vortexing for a few minutes and then stored at 4 °C for at least 12 h prior to measurement. Suspensions were aliquoted and stored at –20 °C. Phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylserine from bovine brain and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from E. coli were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All phospholipids were used without further purification. The fluorescent dyes N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-PE (NBD-PE) and N-(rhodamine B sulfonyl)-PE (Rh-PE) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Recombinant human LBP (456 amino acid holoprotein rLBP50) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, was a kind gift of XOMA LLC (Berkeley, CA). Lipid Sample Preparation—All lipid samples were prepared as aqueous suspensions in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7. For this, the lipids were suspended directly in buffer, thoroughly vortexed, temperature-cycled three times between 4 and 56 °C to enable the formation of stable aggregates and then stored for at least 12 h before measurement. To guarantee physiological conditions, the water content of the samples was usually around 95%. For preparations of liposomes from a mixture corresponding to the phospholipid composition of the macrophage membrane (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, PE, and sphingomyelin in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:0.7:0.5), the lipids were solubilized in chloroform; the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids were resuspended in the appropriate volume of PBS, pH 7.0, and temperature-cycled as described above. Electron microscopy (kindly performed by H. Kühl, Division of Pathology, Forschungszentrum Borstel) revealed large multilamellar liposomes. Activation of Human Mononuclear Cells and Macrophages—Mononuclear cells were isolated from human peripheral blood of healthy donors by the Ficoll-Histopaque gradient method and cultivated at 37 °C with 6% CO2 in Teflon bags in RPMI 1640 medium (endotoxin ≤0.01 EU/ml; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 4% heat-inactivated human serum type AB from healthy donors. Cells were cultured in the presence of 2 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 7 days to differentiate monocytes to macrophages. To determine cytokine induction after cell stimulation, mononuclear cells were seeded in 200-μl aliquots of a suspension of 5 × 106 cells/ml, and macrophages were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 96-well tissue culture dishes (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, with or without 4% human serum, and stimuli were added as indicated in the respective experiments. Cell-free supernatants were collected 4 h after stimulation and stored at –20 °C until determination of cytokine content. Data shown are mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples of one experiment and representative of at least three independent experiments. Antagonistic Action of the Inactive Lipopeptide—Inactive lipopeptides, i.e. compounds that did not induce any cytokines in human mononuclear cells, were investigated with respect to their ability to block the LPS-induced TNFα production in human macrophages. For this, Re LPS from S. minnesota R595 was prepared in three concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 5 ng/ml, and the agonistically inactive lipopeptide was added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and the TNFα production of the macrophages was determined. Transient Transfection and Stimulation of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 unit/ml penicillin, and 0.5 μg/ml streptomycin. The following day, cells were transiently transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol and plasmids containing huTLR4, huMD2, and/or huCD14 as described elsewhere (30Buwitt-Beckmann U. Heine H. Wiesmueller K.H. Jung G. Brock R. Ulmer A.J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6354-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After 6 h of transfection cells were washed and stimulated with LPS at the indicated concentrations in the absence or presence of 10 μm lipolan for a further 24 h. Cell-free supernatants were collected and stored at –20 °C until determination of cytokine content. Data shown are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples of one experiment and representative of at least three independent experiments. Cytokine Determination—Human TNFα was determined in pooled cell-free supernatants of stimulated cells by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal mouse antibody against human TNFα and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human TNFα antibody, respectively (Intex, Muttant, Switzerland), as stated in detail elsewhere (48Mueller M. Brandenburg K. Dedrick R. Schromm A.B. Seydel U. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Human IL-8 was determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using IL-8 cytoset from BIOSOURCE exactly according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data shown are mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples of one representative experiment. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Spectroscopy—The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique was used as a probe dilution assay (49Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Rietschel E.Th. Flad H.-D. Carroll S.F. Seydel U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to obtain information on the intercalation of synthetic lipopeptides into liposomes resembling the lipid composition of the cytoplasmic membrane of macrophages (PLMΦ). For the FRET experiments, liposomes were double-labeled with NBD-PE and Rh-PE in chloroform [PL]:[NBD-PE]:[Rh-PE] at 100:1:1 molar ratios. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids were resuspended in PBS, mixed thoroughly, and sonicated with a Branson sonicator for 1 min (1 ml of solution). Subsequently, the preparation was temperature-cycled at least twice between 4 and 56 °C, and each cycle was followed by intense vortexing for a few minutes and then stored at 4 °C for at least 12 h prior to measurement. A preparation of 900 μl of the double-labeled liposomes (10–5 m) at 37 °C was excited at 470 nm (excitation wavelength of NBD-PE), and the intensities of the emission light of the donor NBD-PE (531 nm) and acceptor Rh-PE (593 nm) were measured simultaneously on the fluorescence spectrometer SPEX F1T11 (SPEX Instruments, Edison, NY). Compounds Pam2CSK4, Pam3CSK4, and lipolan (concentration 1 μm) were added to liposomes after 50 s. Because FRET spectroscopy is used here as a probe dilution assay, intercalation of unlabeled molecules causes an increase of the distance between donor and acceptor and thus leads to a reduced energy transfer. This again causes an increase of the donor and decrease of the acceptor intensities. For a qualitative analysis of experiments, the ratio of the intensities of the donor dye and the acceptor dye are plotted against time (denoted in the following as the FRET signal). The data shown are representative for three independent experiments. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—The infrared spectroscopic measurements were performed on an IFS-55 spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). For phase transition measurements, the lipid samples were placed between CaF2 windows with a 12.5-μm Teflon spacer. Temperature scans were performed automatically between –10 and 70 °C with a heating rate of 0.6 °C/min. Every 3 °C, 50 interferograms were accumulated, apodized, Fourier-transformed, and converted to absorbance spectra. For the identification of particular functional groups, infrared spectra of the lipopeptides at 95% water concentration were analyzed. The vibrational bands typical for the hydrophobic region (symmetrical and antisymmetrical) νs and νas stretching vibration of –CH2–groups around 2920 and 2850 cm–1, respectively, in the IR spectra of lipopeptides are sensitive markers of acyl chain order. X-ray Diffraction—X-ray diffraction measurements were performed at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) outstation at the Hamburg synchrotron radiation facility HASYLAB using the SAXS camera X33 (50Koch M.H.J. Makromol. Chem. Macromol. Symp. 1988; 15: 79-90Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Diffraction patterns in the range of the scattering vector 0.1 < s < 1.0 nm–1 (s = 2 sin θ/λ, 2θ scattering angle and λ the wavelength = 0.15 nm) were recorded at 40 °C with exposure times of 1 min using an image plate detector with on-line readout (MAR345, MarResearch, Norderstedt, Germany). The s axis was calibrated with Ag-Behenate, which has a periodicity of 58.4 nm. The diffraction patterns were evaluated as described previously (51Brandenburg K. Richter W. Koch M.H.J. Meyer H.W. Seydel U. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 91: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) assigning the spacing ratios of the main scattering maxima to defined three-dimensional structures. The lamellar and cubic structures are most relevant here. They are characterized by the following features. 1) Lamellar, the reflections are grouped in equidistant ratios, i.e. 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc. of the lamellar repeat distance dl. 2) Cubic, the different space groups of these nonlamellar three-dimensional structures differ in the ratio of their spacings. The relation between reciprocal spacing shkl = 1/dhkl and lattice constant a is as follows: shkl = ((h2 + k2 + l2)/a)1/2, where hkl = Miller indices of the corresponding set of plane. In the case of very weak diffraction maxima, resolution enhancement techniques were applied, in particular Fourier self-deconvolution as described by Kauppinen et al. (52Kauppinen J.K. Moffat D.J. Mantsch H.H. Cameron D.G. Appl. Spectrosc. 1981; 35: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar). Induction of TNFα in Mononuclear Cells by Synthetic Lipopeptides—The ability of Pam2CSK4 and Pam3CSK4 to induce the production of TNFα in human mononuclear cells was tested in comparison with LPS deep rough mutant Re (from strain R595 of Salmonella minnesota) (Fig. 2). Clearly, Re LPS is active down to 100 pg/ml, whereas the lipopeptides are active at least down to 10 ng/ml. The lipolanthionine peptide lipolan was completely inactive with respect to cytokine induction up to a concentration of 10 μg/ml (data not shown). Synthetic Lipolanthionine Peptide Antagonizes Cell Activation by LPS—It was recently demonstrated that lipolan (Fig. 1) acts as an inhibitor of TLR2-mediated IL-8 secretion induced by the biologically active synthetic lipopeptide Pam3CSK4 (46Seyberth T. Voss S. Brock R. Wiesmueller K.H. Jung G. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1754-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because we did not observe any biological activity of lipolan in human mononuclear cells, we investigated the antagonistic activity of this TLR2 inhibitor with respect to stimulation by LPS (Fig. 3). Using human macrophages differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we show here that lipolan is also able to antagonize cell activation by LPS in human macrophages, as shown by the reduction in TNFα production in the presence of lipolan. Antagonistic Activity of Lipolan Does Not Depend on TLR2—Cell activation by LPS depends on the presence of TLR4/MD-2, whereas lipopeptides induce cell activation via TLR2/TLR1 or TLR2/TLR6 heterodimer complexes (31Buwitt-Beckmann U. Heine H. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. Brock R. Akira S. Ulmer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9049-9057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To get information concerning the involvement of TLRs in the antagonistic activity of lipolan against LPS, we used the defined HEK293 cell transient transfection system. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with TLR4/MD-2 and the coreceptor CD14 and subsequently stimulated with LP"
https://openalex.org/W1983160806,"RGK proteins (Kir/Gem, Rad, Rem, and Rem2) form a small subfamily of the Ras superfamily. Despite a conserved GTP binding core domain, several differences suggest that structure, mechanism of action, and functional regulation differ from Ras. RGK proteins down-regulate voltage-gated calcium channel activity by binding in a GTP-dependent fashion to the Cavβ subunits. Mutational analysis combined with homology modeling reveal a novel effector binding mechanism distinct from that of other Ras GTPases. In this model the Switch 1 region acts as an allosteric activator that facilitates electrostatic interactions between Arg-196 in Kir/Gem and Asp-194, -270, and -272 in the nucleotide-kinase (NK) domain of Cavβ3 and wedging Val-223 and His-225 of Kir/Gem into a hydrophobic pocket in the NK domain. Kir/Gem interacts with a surface on the NK domain that is distinct from the groove where the voltage-gated calcium channel Cavα1 subunit binds. A complex composed of the RGK protein and the Cavβ3 and Cav1.2 subunits could be revealed in vivo using coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Intriguingly, docking of the RGK protein to the NK domain of the Cavβ subunit is reminiscent of the binding of GMP to guanylate kinase.

However, this assumption has been challenged since the β-interacting domain appears to be buried in the Cavβ subunit and, rather, may play a role in the maintenance of a correct conformation (19Chen Y.H.

In addition, a complex containing Rem, the Cavβ subunit and a glutathione S-transferase-α-interacting domain fusion protein was recently demonstrated (22Finlin B.S. Correll R.N. Pang C. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23557-23566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Cavβ subunit interacts with RGK proteins bound to GTP but not GDP and, thus, represents a bona fide effector (4Béguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Kuwamura N. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Béguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Ikeda H. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. J. Mol.

Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, RGK proteins may not be canonical small GTPases that switch between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms. RGK proteins lack critical residues in the G2 (i.e. T35) and G3 (i.e. DXXG60) elements that are important for GTP hydrolysis in other Ras superfamily members (7Kelly K. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 640-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, although most other small GTPases show readily detectable intrinsic GTPase activity, GTP hydrolysis by RGK proteins is exceptionally low (3Finlin B.S. Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Guo N. Andres D.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y.Y. Huang M. Kato R. Dorin D. Tamanoi F. Goga A. Afar D. Rosenberg N. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12448-12452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and they are readily isolated from cells in the GTP-bound form (10Béguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Takahashi A. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1923-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that in cells RGK proteins are constitutively bound to GTP. In this case inactivation of RGK proteins would have to depend on an atypical mechanism for GTP hydrolysis or actively regulated nucleotide exchange. Alternatively, inactivation could be accomplished by sequestering the RGK protein away from its site of action, an attractive possibility given that RGK proteins undergo highly regulated nuclear transport (4Béguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Kuwamura N. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Béguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K.

Seino Y. Hunziker W. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1923-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite these unusual features relative to other small GTPases, little is known about the structure of RGK proteins and how they interact with effectors. Using extensive in vitro mutagenesis combined with in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we identified amino acids in Kir/Gem and the β3 subunit that are critical for their association and used this information to generate a structural model of a complex between the RGK protein and its effector. Our data indicate that RGK proteins and the VDCC α-subunit bind to distinct surfaces on the nucleotide kinase (NK) domain of the β-subunit and reveal an unusual effector binding mechanism for these small GTP-binding proteins. Moreover, a complex composed of an RGK protein, the Cavβ3 subunit, and the intact Cav1.2 subunit was revealed in vivo. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism by which RGK proteins regulate VDCC activity. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay was carried out with full-length Kir/Gem W269G and Cavβ3 (residues 49-379) as described (23Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Tissue Culture and Transfections—COS-1 and HEK-293T cells were grown and transiently transfected with different cDNAs as detailed (10Béguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Takahashi A.

Molecular Biology and Biochemistry—Point mutations in mouse Kir/Gem, rat β3, and rat Cav1.2 were created by PCR. A mouse Rho kinase β cDNA was assembled from different IMAGE clones (i.e. 534680, 5008498, 5149049, 30619707). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Epitope-tagged proteins, the preparation of cell homogenates, and coprecipitation and pulldown experiments have been described (4Béguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Kuwamura N.

For coimmunoprecipitations, cell lysate (400 μg) was prepared in a buffer containing either Tween 0.2% for Cavβ3/RGK interaction studies or in Triton X-100 0.5% for Cavβ3/RGK/Cav1.2 association analysis. The lysate was incubated with 4 μl of anti-FLAG (M2), anti-Myc (Sigma), or anti-HA (Roche Applied Science)-agarose beads and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing, the complexes were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7-8%), and Western blot analysis using either mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-Myc (Roche Applied Science), or rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) antibody was performed. Wild-type (WT) or mutated glutathione S-transferase-Kir/Gem fusion proteins (residues 20-295) (11Béguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T.

Immunocytochemistry—Analysis of the subcellular localization and cell surface expression of the Cav1.2 was done as described (4Béguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Kuwamura N. Yamada Y.

Rabbit anti-Myc (Upstate Biotechnology) and mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) were used for double labeling, and a rat anti-HA monoclonal (Roche Applied Science) was included for triple-labeling experiments. Specimens were visualized with an Axiocam microscope (Carl Zeiss) at 100× magnification. Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling, energy calculations, and three-dimensional rendering of protein structures were performed using the Sybyl software package (Tripos, Inc.). Most molecular dynamics simulations were performed at 300 K at an interval of 1000 fs and 1-fs steps using unless otherwise stated, the parameters from Kollman (25Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.J. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3582) Google Scholar) for the force field and charges. Energy minimization was performed using the method by Powell and Fletcher (26Fletcher R. Powell M.D.J. Comput. J. 1963; 6: 163-168Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of Kir/Gem was taken from the crystallized structure of Gem bound to GDP (PDB 2G2Y). The Switch 1 region (95GVHDSMDDSD-CEVLG109) was rebuilt based on the structure of the GTP-bound form of Rap2A as a template (PDB 2RAP) (27Menetrey J. Cherfils J. Proteins. 1999; 37: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because Arg-196 is not resolved in PDP 2G2Y, its structure was also rendered. The GTP and Mg2+ were from PDB 2RAP were superimposed onto the structure of Kir/Gem using charges assigned by Gasteiger Huckel parameters for GTP and a formal charge of 2+ for the magnesium ion. Molecular dynamics simulations followed by energy refinement using the Tripos Force Field was performed to render the Switch 1 region in the new GTP-bound form of Kir/Gem. The model for the Cavβ3 was derived from the crystal structure of the Cavβ subunit bound to the interacting fragment of the α-subunit (PDB file 1VYT). and the same secondary structure assignments and nomenclature were used (19Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J. Nature. 2004; 429: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Kir/Gem was docked onto Cavβ3 taking into account the wet lab experimental data. The largest surface containing the negatively charged residues on the NK domain important for Kir/Gem binding was used as a starting point. This surface showed good shape complementarity with that of the putative G2 domain of Kir/Gem. Modification of the rotamer conformation of the Kir/Gem Arg-196 side chain was required to position the amine group closely enough for it to interact with the carboxyl groups of Asp-194, -270, Asp-272 in Cavβ3. Molecular dynamics simulations and energy minimization determined the optimal position of the Arg-196 side chain with respect to the three Asp residues of Cavβ3. The side chains of Val-223 and His-225 in Kir/Gem fit nicely into a large hydrophobic pocket on the NK domain of the Cavβ subunit. Molecular dynamics simulations (100-fs interval) were performed on the sequence 221AAVQHN226 to investigate the reasons behind the results of the wet lab mutational analysis of Val-223 and His-225. Mutations were introduced in silico into Kir/Gem, and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to explore the optimal conformations. For the R196K mutation, residues in a sphere radius of 6 Å were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to explore differences in the conformations of Asp-194, 270, and -272. Identification of Residues in Kir/Gem Critical for the Interaction with Cavβ3—To identify amino acids important for the interaction with Cavβ3, we first generated a truncated form of Kir/Gem containing the core Ras homology domain (amino acids 74-251, Fig. 1A) with the G1-G5 motifs involved in GTP binding (Fig. 1A, gray). As assessed by pulldown experiments, this core domain was sufficient for the nucleotide-dependent interaction with the Cavβ3 subunit (data not shown). We then mutated clusters of three amino acids in the core domain to Ala and tested the interaction of the mutants with Cavβ3 using a Y2H assay. Individual Ala substitutions in the susceptible regions (Fig. 1B, red) led to the identification of nine residues whose mutation interfered with Cavβ3 binding (Fig. 1C). The lack of an interaction between the different Kir/Gem mutants and Cavβ3 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1D). Because calmodulin when bound to Kir/Gem may interfere with Cavβ3 binding (10Béguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Takahashi A. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1923-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Béguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), corresponding mutations were also introduced into Kir/Gem W269G, which does not bind calmodulin, and tested for association with Cavβ3. Except for the W269G/V195A mutant (Fig. 1D, lane 15), no coprecipitation was observed. Because V195A (in either the WT or the W269G context) displayed residual binding to Cavβ3 in pulldown experiments (supplemental Data I), we concluded that this residue is less critical for the interaction. Kir/Gem migrates on SDS-PAGE as a doublet, and alkaline phosphatase treatment indicates that the slower migrating band is a phosphorylated form (data not shown). Interestingly, only the faster migrating, non-phosphorylated form of Kir/Gem binds Cavβ3. Furthermore, only the lower band was detected in Kir/Gem mutants that bind neither GTP nor GDP (see Fig. 3), indicating that phosphorylation is sensitive to conformation.FIGURE 3Identification of residues in Kir/Gem important for Cavβ3 binding as opposed to conformation.

The solved Kir/Gem-GDP structure is overall very similar to that of the GDP- or GTP-bound Rap2A (28Pizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 201-204PubMed Google Scholar), which has 21% sequence identity with Kir/Gem and is the closest homologue to have been crystallized in its GTP-bound form (27Menetrey J. Cherfils J. Proteins. 1999; 37: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Switch 1 region in the GDP Kir/Gem structure was not completely resolved, indicating that this region may be disordered, an observation that is confirmed by the recently solved structure of GDP-bound Rad (29Yanuar A. Sakurai S. Kitano K. Hakoshima T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, we used molecular dynamics simulations to render the Switch 1 region of Kir/Gem using the GTP-bound form of Rap2A, including GTP and Mg2+, as a template (Fig. 2A). These calculations indicate that in the GTP-bound form of Kir/Gem, GTP, and Mg2+ order the Switch 1 region via the coordination with negatively charged residues in Switch 1. The orientation of the long side chain Arg-196 was also not resolved in the crystal structure of GDP-bound Kir/Gem (Fig. 2A). The backbone structure of this region is assumed to be identical in the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Kir/Gem based on the absence of major structural variations between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Rap2A (Fig. 2C). Several of the residues that affect Cavβ3 binding when mutated are buried in the modeled GTP-bound Kir/Gem structure (Fig. 2C), raising the possibility that their mutation alters the conformation of Kir/Gem rather than binding per se. We, therefore, carried out GTP and GDP binding assays to monitor the conformation of the different Kir/Gem mutants. Except for R196A and V223A, the mutants (i.e. L90A, Y156A, L194A, V200A, F231A) displayed a dramatic reduction in both GTP (Fig. 3A, panel a) and GDP (Fig. 3A, panel b) binding, suggesting that they affect the conformation of Kir/Gem. Binding of nucleotides to H225A and V195A was by comparison only marginally affected. Interestingly, Arg-196, Val-223, and His-225 are located on the same surface in the modeled Kir/Gem (Fig. 2C), consistent with them being part of the effector binding domain. This region does not show major conformational differences between the GTP- and GDP-bound structures in Rap2A (Fig. 2B), and Arg-196, Val-223, and His-225 are in close proximity of the G4 and G5 motif. The location and orientation of Arg-196, Val-223, and His-225 is, thus, subject to the conformational constraints for nucleotide binding imposed by the G4 and G5 motifs. Selected amino acids whose substitution to Ala affected either nucleotide and Cavβ3 (Leu-90, Tyr-156) or only Cavβ3 (Arg-196) binding were analyzed in more detail in the Y2H (Fig. 2D) or coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B) assay. Analysis of all known small G proteins showed the presence of Leu, Ile, or Met and Tyr or Phe at the positions corresponding to Kir/Gem Leu-90 and Tyr-196. In contrast to L90A and Y156A, L90I, L90M, and Y156F bound Cavβ3, indicating the importance of these residues for a conserved conformation among the small GTPase superfamily members. Arg-196, which when mutated to Ala selectively affects Cavβ3 binding of Kir/Gem, was substituted to all possible amino acids found in the other Ras superfamily members (30Colicelli J. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : RE13Google Scholar). Only the conservative R196K substitution retained binding of Cavβ3 to Kir/Gem (Figs. 2D and 3B, lanes 1-4), indicating that Arg-196 plays a crucial role for the selective interaction of RGK proteins, but not other small GTPases, with the β-subunit. Analysis of Val-223 revealed that conservative substitutions (i.e. V223W, V223F, V223I, V223M, V223Y, V223L) did not affect Cavβ3 binding in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3B), highlighting the requirement of a bulky hydrophobic residue at this position. The only exception was a substitution to Met (see below). Although conservative substitutions of His-225 by Trp and Phe retained binding, the H225R, H225K, and H225I mutants did not associate with Cavβ3. Thus, the large planar side chain rather than the positive charge of His-225 accounts for the association of Kir/Gem with Cavβ3. The critical role of Arg-196 and Val-223 of Kir/Gem for Cavβ3 association was corroborated in vivo. The colocalization of Kir/Gem and Cavβ3 to dendrite-like elongations and the Kir/Gem W269G-mediated nuclear accumulation of β3 were no longer observed in cells expressing the R196A or V223A mutants (supplemental Data II). Residues in Kir/Gem Critical for Cavβ3 Binding Are Conserved in Rad, Rem, and Rem2—Because all RGK proteins bind Cavβ subunits (see (7Kelly K"

Laminin-111, recently renamed from laminin-1 to better reflect its α1β 1γ1 subunit composition, is one of the first two laminins to be expressed during embryonic development, appearing in the peri-implantation period in the basement membrane of the embryonic plate along with laminin-511 (laminin-10) and in the absence of other laminins in Reichert's membrane (1Miner J.H.

Later in development, laminin-111 is strongly expressed in placenta, liver, kidney, and testis, where it is thought to play a role in organogenesis (3Sasaki T. Giltay R. Talts U. Timpl R. Talts J.F.

Targeted inactivation of the LAMA1 gene coding for the α1 chain was found to result in a failure of Reichert's membrane with developmental arrest by embryonic day 6.5 in the mouse (4Miner J.H. Li C.

The N-terminal LN domain participates in polymerization by interacting with the LN domains of the β1 and γ1 chains. The C-terminal LG domains, LG1-3, bind to the α6β1 integrin, whereas LG4-5 bind to heparin, sulfated glycolipids, and α-dystroglycan (α-DG). The polymerization and cell-anchoring activities are thought to act in concert to assemble a functional basement membrane on a cell surface (6Li S. Harrison D. Carbonetto S. Fassler R. Smyth N.

Although the structure of LG1-3 remains to be elucidated, it is thought that these three domains form a closed arrangement with similar angles between domains and separated from the LG4-5 pair by a hinge-like region (9Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Analysis of contributions of α1LG4-5 to laminin interactions with Schwann cells, myotubes, and developing epithelia has led to a model in which these domains provide the major anchoring activity of laminin, an initiating event of basement membrane assembly that leads to alterations of the cell cytoskeleton accompanied by signaling (6Li S.

Basic residues within the LG4-5 pair of several laminins mediate key interactions with three types of molecules: heparan sulfate chains that are attached to perlecan, agrin, collagen, and syndecan core proteins of basement membranes and cell surface; the glycoprotein α-DG that is a component of a larger transmembrane and submembrane complex associated with dystrophin and utrophin; and sulfated glycolipids, in particular the sulfatides, that can be present in the outer leaflet of the cell plasma membrane. Earlier mutagenesis analyses of recombinant laminin α1 and α2LG fragments revealed that there are binding similarities and differences between the two laminins. Heparin, representing the highly sulfated regions of glycosaminoglycan chains, α-DG, and galactosyl-3-sulfate ceramide (galactosyl sulfatide) all bind to an extensive basic surface region between the calcium sites of the laminin α2 LG4-5 domain pair (12Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 13Wizemann H. Garbe J.H. Friedrich M.V. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, a smaller topographical region confined to LG4 appears to bind the same cell surface components in the laminin α1 chain (12Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 14Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Mol.

The present study describes the crystal structure of laminin α1LG4-5 in conjunction with a site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro analysis of the binding sites for heparin, α-DG, and sulfatides. We report that the backbone of the α1LG4-5 domain pair is very similar to that of α2LG4-5, but there are significant differences in the distribution of charged residues on the protein surface. Binding of α1LG4-5 to heparin, α-DG, and sulfatides was found to be dependent upon partially overlapping basic amino acid residue clusters. Our results have led, we believe, to an improved understanding of the amino acid residues involved in each type of interaction and will aid in defining the biological roles of different laminin ligands. Laminin α1LG4-5 Vector Constructs—An expression construct containing the wild-type (WT) mouse laminin α1LG4-5 sequence (coding for residues 2666LHREH… PGPEP3060 of the mature laminin α1 chain (i.e. the numbering scheme used here omits the 24-residue signal peptide of SwissProt entry P19137)) was created by amplifying cDNA from laminin α1 pCIS (15Yurchenco P.D. Quan Y. Colognato H. Mathus T. Harrison D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) utilizing three successive PCRs. Three overlapping 5′ sense primers were used to place a 5′-terminal NheI site followed by the 5′-untranslated region and signal sequence of human BM-40 (cleaved by the signal peptidase) and a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK), whereas the 3′ primer placed a KpnI site downstream of the STOP codon at the 3′ terminus of the amplified product (oligonucleotide sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1). Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) was used along with a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MI Research) to amplify the DNA, which was then purified after each reaction (UltraClean PCR DNA purification kit; MoBio). The NheI and KpnI sites were used to clone the PCR product into the analogous sites in the pcDNA3.1+/zeo vector (Invitrogen). The mutated α1LG4-5 DNAs were constructed by strand overlap extension PCR using the same three 5′ upstream sense primers and downstream 3′ antisense oligonucleotide in conjunction with internal primers introducing the desired mutations. Escherichia coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the plasmids, and plasmid DNA was purified by alkaline lysis and spin columns (Ultra-Clean Standard Mini Plasma Prep Kit, MoBio). All generated plasmids were completely sequenced. Recombinant α1LG4-5 Protein Production and Purification—Expression constructs were linearized with BglII (New England Biolabs) and transfected into the human kidney fibroblast cell line 293 (ATCC) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and stable clones were selected under zeocin for secretion of α1LG4-5 protein. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Once cells had reached confluence, the growth medium was replaced with fresh medium minus zeocin and then collected 72 h later. The genomic DNA was isolated from the cells after medium harvesting (Exact-N-Amp kit; Sigma) and sequenced to verify the identity of the various α1LG4-5 proteins. The conditioned media were passed through a gravity column (Bio-Rad) packed with anti-FLAG M2-agarose resin (Sigma), and recombinant α1LG4-5 proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) in 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (TBS50/Ca) at 4 °C. The eluted proteins were then loaded onto a heparin 5PW column (TosoHass) on anÄkta FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences), where the FLAG peptide (unbound component) was recovered for reuse, and the α1LG4-5 proteins were eluted using a 1 m NaCl gradient. The eluted α1LG4-5 proteins were concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged into TBS50/Ca at room temperature via centrifugal filtration with Amicon Ultra spin filters (Millipore). The recombinant proteins were further dialyzed against TBS50/Ca buffer with several buffer changes for 2 days using dialysis cassettes (Slide-A-Lyzer; Pierce). Deglycosylated WT α1LG4-5 protein was produced either by isolating WT α1LG4-5 from the medium of stably transfected cell lines grown in 2 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 24 h or by treating 50 μg of purified α1LG4-5 with 1000 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) in TBS50/Ca for 1 h at 37 °C. Laminin α1LG4-5 Vector Construct for Crystallography—DNA coding for residues 2682QPELC… PGPEP3060 of the mature mouse laminin α1 chain was obtained by PCR amplification from laminin α1 pCIS (15Yurchenco P.D.

The PCR primers added NotI and NheI sites at the 5′ end and a STOP codon followed by XhoI and BamHI sites at the 3′ end. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript II KS+ using NotI and BamHI, and four mutations (N2714Q, N2811K, N2900Q, and C3014S) were introduced by strand overlap extension PCR. The sequence-verified insert was cloned into the pCEP-Pu vector (16Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) using NheI and XhoI. After cleavage of the BM-40 sequence signal, a vector-derived APLA sequence remains at the N terminus of the secreted recombinant α1LG4-5 protein. Protein Production for Crystallography—The laminin α1LG4-5 quadruple mutant (N2714Q/N2811K/N2900Q/C3014S) was purified from the conditioned medium of episomally transfected 293-EBNA cells. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), transfected using Fugene reagent (Roche Applied Science), and selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Serum-free conditioned medium (1.5 liters) was dialyzed against 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, and loaded onto a 2 × 5-ml heparin HiTrap column (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (0-1 m). The α1LG4-5 mutant protein eluted as a sharp single peak at ∼0.5 m NaCl and was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a 24-ml Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) run at 0.5 ml/min in 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The final yield was 4 mg of pure protein. Crystal Structure Determination—The α1LG4-5 quadruple mutant protein was concentrated to 19 mg/ml in 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5. Crystals were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion using 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm MgCl2 as precipitant. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen in mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol. Diffraction data to 1.9 Å resolution were collected at 100 K on beamline 9.6 at the SRS Daresbury (λ = 0.87 Å). The crystals belong to space group P21, a = 70.53 Å, b = 55.81 Å, c = 100.99 Å, β = 98.48°. There are two α1LG4-5 molecules in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a solvent content of ∼45%. The diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM (available on the World Wide Web at www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/harry/mosflm) and programs of the CCP4 suite (17Collaborative Computing Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (18Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a search model; the LG domains had to be placed individually to obtain a solution. The structure was rebuilt with O (19Jones T.A.

Open table in a new tab Heparin Binding of Laminin α1 E3 Fragment and Recombinant α1LG4-5—The laminin-111 E3 fragment was prepared from laminin-111 purified from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma tumor (21Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E3 fragment, recombinant α1LG4-5, α1LG4-5 treated with enterokinase to remove the FLAG tag, and mutant α1LG4-5 proteins were loaded onto a TosoHass Heparin 5PW column in TBS50/Ca at 4 °C on anÄkta FPLC system and eluted with a 0-1 m NaCl salt gradient, and the NaCl concentration required for elution was determined. Analysis of α1LG4-5 Binding to α-Dystroglycan—α-DG was purified from rabbit muscle as described (22Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of α-DG (1 μg) were loaded into the slots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed under reducing conditions. The protein bands were then electroeluted onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, and assessed for binding to each α1LG4-5 protein (1 μg/ml) using a previously described overlay assay (23Ervasti J.M. Burwell A.L. Geissler A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22315-22321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Binding of the α1LG4-5 proteins was detected with 1 ml of 1.1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidasecoupled anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) per 3.5 cm2 of blot membrane. The solid phase assay was performed in 96-well microtiter plates with α-DG bound to the plate (100 μl of 1 μg/ml per well) and incubated with various concentrations of α1LG4-5 proteins as previously described (24Smirnov S.P. McDearmon E.L. Li S. Ervasti J.M. Tryggvason K. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18928-18937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), except that horseradish peroxidase-linked monoclonal FLAG antibody M2 (100 μl of 1.1 μg/ml per well) was used for detection followed by color development with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Bio-Rad). Color development was quantitated at 655 nm using a Molecular Dynamics Spectramax 340 UV-visible microplate reader (25McDearmon E.L. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44868-44873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We verified that the signal readout was linear to OD > 3 by collecting kinetic data on color development. Estimates of half-maximal binding (KD) and binding capacity (Bmax) were determined by curve fitting of the binding data of WT LG4-5 using a single-site model (fitted values = Bmax × L/(KD + L), where L is the molar ligand concentration), with the calculated Bmax value used for subsequent determinations of all other half-maximal binding, an approach employed to minimize the errors inherent in estimating binding from plots that are low and nearly linear over the concentration range evaluated. Analysis of α1LG4-5 Binding to Galactosyl Sulfatide and Other Lipids—The ammonium salt of HSO4-3Galβ1-1′ceramide (brain sulfatides; Avanti Polar Lipids) was dissolved in methanol, and 10 μg was added per immulon-1B microtiter plate well (ThermoLabsystems). The plate was dried at 37 °C for 2 h, and the wells were washed four times with 200 μl of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay wash buffer (EWB; 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS50/Ca) at room temperature. The wells were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 200 μl of EWB, followed by three 200-μl washes of EWB. α1LG4-5 proteins in varying concentrations in EWB were added to each well and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed four times with 200 μl of EWB, and horseradish peroxidase-linked monoclonal FLAG antibody (Sigma) in EWB was added. After 1 h at room temperature, the wells were washed four times with EWB, and 150 μl of substrate solution (4 mm o-phenylenediamine (Sigma), 50 mm citric acid, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 0.012% H2O2) was added. The developing color reaction was stopped after 2-10 min by the addition of 60 μl of 2 m H2SO4, followed by 50 μl of ethanol, and the plates were read in a TECAN SpectraFluor microtiter spectrophotometer at 492 nm. Samples with OD > 2 were diluted and remeasured to correct for any deviation from linearity. A molecular mass of 44.3 kDa was used to calculate molar α1LG4-5 concentrations. Inhibition studies were performed in the presence of either 10 μg/ml low molecular weight heparin (Sigma) or 5 mm EDTA. The assay was also performed with several other lipids: galactosyl ceramide (Avanti Polar Lipids and Sigma), sphingomyelin (Avanti Polar Lipids), phosphatidic acid (Avanti Polar Lipids), cholesterol 3-sulfate (Sigma), and GM1 ganglioside (Avanti Polar Lipids). Half-maximal binding was estimated in the same manner as described for α-DG. Electron Microscopy—Pt/C rotary shadowing of proteins was performed by deposition of 0.9-nm metal at an 8° angle as previously described (21Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Images are shown with reversed contrast. Crystal Structure of Laminin α1LG4-5—The C-terminal LG domain pair of the laminin α1 chain contains an unpaired cysteine (Cys3014) and three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn2714, Asn2811, and Asn2900). Because we found that WT α1LG4-5 preparations always contained a small fraction of disulfide-linked dimers (data not shown), we mutated Cys3014 to serine. An α1LG4-5 C3014S construct with an N-terminal His tag failed to crystallize, as did several other constructs with additional mutations of asparagine residues modified by glycosylation. Eventually, crystals could be obtained of an untagged α1LG4-5 quadruple mutant (N2714Q/N2811K/N2900Q/C3014S) devoid of any N-linked carbohydrate. The crystal structure of this mutant, hereafter termed simply α1LG4-5, was refined at 1.9 Å resolution to Rfree = 0.261 (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of the crystals contains two crystallographically independent α1LG4-5 molecules, A and B. We observed clear electron density for both molecules, with the exception of residues 2987-2990, 3032-3034, and 3060 of molecule A and residues 2682-2684 and 3060 of molecule B. Molecules A and B are very similar in their LG4 and LG5 domain structures (root mean square deviation 0.36 and 0.58 Å, respectively, for all Cα atoms) but differ substantially in their respective domain arrangements. When the molecules are superimposed on their LG4 domains, a rotation by 14.5° is required to bring their LG5 domains into superposition; the pivot point of this rotation is in the interdomain linker, near Tyr2871 (Fig. 1A). The following description of the structure is based upon the more complete molecule B. The α1LG4-5 structure consists of two canonical LG domains (9Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), LG4 and LG5, connected by a short linker and interacting through a small interface near the domain termini (Fig. 1B). Each LG domain folds into a curved β-sandwich built from two antiparallel sheets and contains a single disulfide bond near the C terminus. A third disulfide bond tethers the segment preceding LG4 to an α-helical turn in LG5. The interface between LG4 and LG5 is water-filled and predominantly polar, and the different conformations of molecules A and B are likely to be due to the paucity of specific interactions in the LG4-LG5 interface. Both LG4 and LG5 contain one bound metal ion, located on the rim of the β-sandwich opposite the interdomain linker. These ions have been modeled as magnesium, given their coordination geometry and the high magnesium concentration in the crystals, but we assume that the binding sites are occupied by calcium under physiological conditions (7Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Magnesium ion 1 is coordinated octahedrally by the side chains of Asp2747 and Asp2816, the main chain carbonyl oxygens of residues 2764 and 2814, and two water molecules; the average metal-ligand distance is 2.17 Å. Magnesium ion 2 is coordinated octahedrally by the side chains of Asp2923 and Asp2996, the main chain carbonyl oxygens of residues 2940 and 2994, and two water molecules; the average metal-ligand distance is 2.15 Å. The unpaired cysteine of α1LG4-5, Cys3014, is located in the convoluted loop that occupies most of the concave face of LG5. Two predicted N-linked glycosylation sites are located in LG4 (Asn2714 and Asn2811) and one in LG5 (Asn2900). Asn2811 is close to the metal ion binding site in LG4 (Fig. 1B). Structural Comparison of α1LG4-5 and α2LG4-5—Mouse laminin α1LG4-5 is 41% identical to the homologous region of the mouse α2 chain (α2LG4-5) (Fig. 2A), whereas the sequence identity to the α3-5 chains is substantially lower (<30%). A structural comparison of α1LG4-5 and α2LG4-5 (8Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reveals only a few notable differences at the level of individual LG domains. LG4 of laminin α1 and α2 can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.91 Å for 148 Cα atoms; the major differences are concentrated in the spatially adjacent B-C and L-M loops and in the edge β-strand J, which is irregular in α1LG4-5 (Fig. 2B). The LG5 domains can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.59 Å for 153 Cα atoms; the major differences are again concentrated in the B-C and L-M loops (Fig. 2C). The relative arrangement of LG4 and LG5 in α1LG4-5 and α2LG4-5 is also similar, with α2LG4-5 more closely resembling molecule B than molecule A of α1LG4-5 (not shown). In terms of their interdomain angles, the two crystallographically independent α1LG4-5 molecules are, in fact, more different than α2LG4-5 is from molecule B of α1LG4-5. Notably, only a few contacts in the LG4-LG5 interface are conserved in the two laminin isoforms. Near the pivot point of interdomain flexibility, an aromatic side chain (Tyr2871 in α1LG4-5) stacks against a proline (Pro3056 in α1LG4-5). Further away from the hinge, a conserved leucine in LG4 (Leu2703 in α1LG4-5) makes a van der Waals contact with a proline in LG5 (Pro3052 in α1LG4-5). Finally, a conserved glutamine (Gln2700 in α1LG4-5) points its side chain into the water-filled cavity within the interdomain interface (not shown). The coordination of the two magnesium ions in α1LG4-5 is identical to that of the two calcium ions in α2LG4-5, with equivalent protein residues acting as metal ligands (Fig. 2A) and water molecules observed in equivalent positions in both structures. Thus, we expect that calcium would readily occupy the metal sites of α1LG4-5 under more physiological conditions than those used for crystallization.

https://openalex.org/W2001609847,"Most cultured cells and intact animals die under hyperoxic conditions. However, a strain of HeLa cells that proliferates under 80% O2, termed “HeLa-80,” has been derived from wildtype HeLa cells (“HeLa-20”) by selection for resistance to stepwise increases of oxygen partial pressure. The tolerance of HeLa-80 cells to hyperoxia is not associated with changes in antioxidant defenses or susceptibility to oxidant-mediated killing. Rather, under both 20 and 80% O2, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is ∼2-fold less in HeLa-80 cells, likely related to a significantly higher cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity (∼2-fold), which may act to deplete upstream electron-rich intermediates responsible for ROS generation. We now report that in HeLa-80 cells elevated COX activity is associated with a >2-fold increase in the regulatory subunit COX Vb, whereas expression levels of other subunits are very close to wild type. Small interfering RNA against Vb selectively lowers COX Vb expression in HeLa-80 cells, increases mitochondrial ROS generation, decreases COX activity 60–80%, and diminishes viability under 80% (but not 20%) O2. In addition, overexpression of subunit Vb increases COX activity and decreases ROS production in wild-type HeLa-20 cells, along with some increase in tolerance to hyperoxia. Overall, our results indicate that it is possible to make cells tolerant of hyperoxia by manipulation of mitochondrial electron transport. These observations may suggest new pharmaceutical strategies to diminish oxygen-mediated cellular damage. Most cultured cells and intact animals die under hyperoxic conditions.

Metab. 2000; 71: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hyperoxia also causes pulmonary damage in adults exposed to high partial pressures of inhaled O2 for more than 48 h. The symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, decreased vital capacity, and increased alveolar-capillary permeability (2Mantell L.L. Lee P.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3Slutsky A.S. Chest. 1999; 116: S9-S15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as damage to cardiovascular, nervous, and gastrointestinal systems (4Bostek C.C. AANA. J. 1989; 57: 231-237PubMed Google Scholar, 5Crapo J.D. Barry B.E. Foscue H.A. Shelburne J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1980; 122: 123-143PubMed Google Scholar, 6Janssen Y.M. Van Houten B. Borm P.J.

Pharmacother. 1992; 26: 1554-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in hyperoxic damage are still not completely understood.It is commonly believed that free radicals play a central role in oxygen toxicity, and cellular damage is probably mediated by increased production of ROS 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; DCFDA, dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HeLa-20, wild-type HeLa cells; HeLa-80, oxygen-tolerant HeLa cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NS, non-sense; DCF, dihydrodichlorofluorescein; oligo, oligonucleotide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone; FBS, fetal bovine serum. 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; DCFDA, dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HeLa-20, wild-type HeLa cells; HeLa-80, oxygen-tolerant HeLa cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NS, non-sense; DCF, dihydrodichlorofluorescein; oligo, oligonucleotide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone; FBS, fetal bovine serum. (9Gerschman R. Gilbert D. Nye S.W. Dwyer P. Fenn W.O. Nutrition. 2001; 17: 162PubMed Google Scholar). This excessive production of ROS likely derives from the mitochondria which, under conditions of high oxygen, exhibit increased “leak” from the electron transport chain (9Gerschman R. Gilbert D. Nye S.W. Dwyer P. Fenn W.O. Nutrition. 2001; 17: 162PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar). Our previous results lend support to the importance of mitochondrial respiration and ROS generation in the etiology of hyperoxic cell damage. Using three strategies to diminish mitochondrial ROS production by HeLa cells (rhoo cells, chronic exposure to chloramphenicol, and exposure to the protonophoric uncoupler of respiration, CCCP) we consistently found improved cell survival and growth under hyperoxic conditions (11Li J. Gao X. Qian M. Eaton J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1460-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).In an effort to further understand the nature of hyperoxic damage, we focused on an oxygen-tolerant strain of HeLa cells, which proliferates even under 80% O2 (HeLa-80). This strain was derived from wild-type HeLa cells (HeLa-20) by selection for resistance to stepwise increases of oxygen partial pressure (12Joenje H. Gille J.J. Oostra A.B. van der Valk P. Lab. Investig. 1985; 52: 420-428PubMed Google Scholar). The oxygen tolerant HeLa-80 cells exhibit significantly decreased mitochondrial ROS generation (under both normoxia and hyperoxia). Furthermore, the lessened ROS production probably derives from enhanced activity of the terminal component of electron transport, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) (13Campian J.L. Gao X. Qian M. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46580-46587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We earlier speculated that the net effect of this increased COX activity might be to deplete electron-rich intermediates (such as ubisemiquinone) in the electron transport chain, thereby diminishing the leak of electrons into ROS. In partial support of this, preferential inhibition of COX by treatment with n-methyl protoporphyrin (which selectively diminishes synthesis of heme a that is required for cytochrome c oxidase activity) enhances ROS production and abrogates the oxygen tolerance of the HeLa-80 cells (13Campian J.L. Gao X. Qian M. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46580-46587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Cytochrome c oxidase (also known as complex IV) is the terminal complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is comprised of 13 different subunits encoded by three mitochondrial genes (COX subunits I, II, and III) and 10 nuclear genes (COX subunits IV, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIc, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, and VIII). Given the complex nature of COX, the reasons for increased activity in HeLa-80 cells were unclear; clearly, gain-of-function mutations in all 13 would be very unlikely, but increased expression of some or all of the subunits of COX remained a possibility.We now report that the elevated COX activity in oxygen-tolerant HeLa-80 cells is associated with a >2-fold increase in the regulatory subunit COX Vb, whereas expression levels of other subunits are very close to wild-type HeLa-20 cells. Transfection of COX Vb-specific siRNA into HeLa-80 cells selectively lowers Vb expression, increases mitochondrial ROS generation, decreases COX activity 60–80%, and diminishes viability under 80% (but not 20%) O2. In addition, in wild-type HeLa-20 cells, overexpression of subunit Vb increases COX activity, decreases ROS production, and increases tolerance to hyperoxia. We speculate that manipulations designed to similarly enhance the “downhill” flow of electrons in the electron transport chain may have some utility in the suppression of cell damage caused by hyperoxia and other insults.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—A wild-type strain of HeLa cells (HeLa-20) and an oxygen-tolerant strain that grows normally under 80% oxygen (HeLa-80) were generously provided by Dr. Hans Joenje (VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Opti-MEM, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsin-EDTA, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Invitrogen. Dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and dihydroethidium were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All antibodies, including the primary monoclonal antibodies (mouse anti-human) for cytochrome c oxidase subunits and a secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG), were purchased from Molecular Probes. Oligofectamine was purchased from Invitrogen. FuGENE 6 was obtained from Roche Applied Science. The pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO-TA expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Mitchell (University of Louisville, Louisville, KY).Conditions of Cell Culture—HeLa cells were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS under 20% O2 (normoxia) or 80% O2 (hyperoxia) with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For routine passage, cells were washed with PBS and lifted with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in PBS. Stock cultures were grown in 10-cm cell culture dishes in a Forma Scientific incubator under an atmosphere of 20% O2,5%CO2. Exposure to hyperoxia was performed with cells grown in 10-cm dishes under an atmosphere of 80% O2, 15% N2, and 5% CO2 contained in a specially designed gas-tight modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA). Because susceptibility to hyperoxia may vary with cell density (14Jyonouchi H. Sun S.N. Abiru T. Chareancholvanich S. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the initial cell number was routinely adjusted to ∼1 × 105 per dish in DMEM. The sealed chamber was placed in a standard tissue culture incubator, and the gas was replenished every 48 h. The survival and growth of cells were assessed over a period of 10 days by counting cell numbers in marked sectors of the culture dishes using light microscopy.It is important to note that the oxygen tolerance of HeLa-80 is a stable characteristic. Even after these cells have been continuously passed in normoxic culture for more than 2 months, they retain resistance to 80% O2. To avoid artifacts that might be introduced by the tendency of cell cultures to “drift,” cultures of both cell types were replenished from liquid nitrogen stabilities every 30 days, and the oxygen tolerance of each new culture was checked.Estimation of ROS Production—ROS production was assessed by the oxidation of DCFDA or dihydroethidium. To estimate ROS production with DCFDA, cells were plated onto 48-well plates at an initial density of 2 × 104 cells per well and grown for 3 days. After cells were >90% confluent, they were washed three times with HBSS, and then 0.5 ml of HBSS was replaced per well. Following the addition of 20 μm DCFDA (final concentration), the appearance of DCF fluorescence was followed continuously using a thermostated plate reading spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA), typically for 1 h, at excitation 486 nm and emission 530 nm. Cell protein in each well was measured using the bicinchoninic acid reaction (15Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18447) Google Scholar) (Pierce), and the DCF fluorescence was corrected for variations in total protein between wells.Generation of ROS was also evaluated under both 20 and 80% O2 using the oxidation of dihydroethidium (16Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated and grown as for experiments with DCFDA (as mentioned above). When the cells were >90% confluent, fresh medium was added containing 100 μm dihydroethidium. Dihydroethidium oxidation permits estimates of ROS formation over longer periods of time in complete culture medium, and the product, ethidium, is held within the cell via intercalation into nucleic acids. After incubation with dihydroethidium for 4 h, cells were washed three times with HBSS, and ethidium fluorescence was detected at excitation 520 nm and emission 610 nm. Again, the relative fluorescence was corrected for variations in cell protein between individual wells.Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Real time quantitative RT-PCR measurements of the levels of mRNA for COX subunits along with control β-actin mRNA were carried out. RNA was prepared as described previously (17Holthofer H. Kretzler M. Haltia A. Solin M.L. Taanman J.W. Schagger H. Kriz W. Kerjaschki D. Schlondorff D. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers for the human genes have been tested and published (18Grandjean F. Bremaud L. Robert J. Ratinaud M.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Results were obtained by measuring the cycle threshold (CT), the first cycle in which there is significant increase in fluorescence above the background, and which correlates to the log-linear phase of PCR amplification. Generally, the runs were stopped at eight cycles after CT. The relative quantification in mRNA levels was evaluated by the ratio between the target gene and the housekeeping gene β-actin. Data calculation was based on the “Delta-Delta method,” using the equation of R (ratio) = 2–(ΔCT sample–ΔCT control) (19Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (119535) Google Scholar). The identity of the amplified DNA was confirmed by determination of melting temperature.There are two different methods of analyzing data from real time quantitative RT-PCR, absolute quantification and relative quantification. Absolute quantification can be done using a competitive oligonucleotide. Relative quantification involves measurement of the ratio between mRNA levels for the gene of interest versus a housekeeping gene. In the present instance, we used relative quantification because if mRNA levels for an appropriate housekeeping gene are used, it is adequate for investigating proportionate changes in gene expression levels. The caveat is that relative quantification relies on the assumption that the reference gene is unaffected by the experimental conditions.Western Blot Analysis—General conditions of cell culture were as described previously (11Li J. Gao X. Qian M. Eaton J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1460-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a semi-quantitative method to determine the levels of COX subunits in HeLa-20 and HeLa-80 cell lines, we performed Western blot analysis on COX subunits from both cell types. Lysates were prepared from near-confluent cultures of HeLa cells using RIPA lysis buffer (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) with protease inhibitors. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. Twenty μg of total cellular protein was loaded on 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, followed by incubation at room temperature 1 h with primary monoclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution in PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) buffer) against human COX subunits (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For detection of immunoreactivity, the blots were incubated in a secondary antibody solution (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse diluted 1:4000 in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 buffer) and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence, ECL™-Plus Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). β-Actin was used as a loading control.COX Assay—Lysates of fresh cells (directly counted and adjusted to 6 × 106 cells/ml) were prepared by suspension in 0.25 m sucrose, 40 mm potassium chloride, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and disrupted by 10 1-s bursts from a microtip Fisher model 100 sonic dismembrator at scale 3 (on a scale of 0–10 of the 100-watt maximum power output) (Fisher). The lysate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was used for COX assays (20Jarreta D. Orus J. Barrientos A. Miro O. Roig E. Heras M. Moraes C.T. Cardellach F. Casademont J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Assays contained ∼20 μg of protein and were performed at 37 °C in 200-μl reaction volumes. The assay involved the addition of 30 μm ferrocytochrome c in an isosmotic medium (10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 6.5), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.3 m sucrose) containing 2.5 mm n-dodecyl maltoside to permeabilize mitochondrial membranes (20Jarreta D. Orus J. Barrientos A. Miro O. Roig E. Heras M. Moraes C.T. Cardellach F. Casademont J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To confirm that this method specifically detects the oxidase activity, 10 μm antimycin-A was added to a control group to block complex III. The activity was calculated from the rate of decrease in absorbance of ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm (ϵ = 19.1 mm–1 cm–1) (21Kruidering M. Van De Water B. De Heer E. Mulder G.J. Nagelkerke J.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 638-649PubMed Google Scholar), and results were normalized for protein.siRNA Transfection—Two siRNA duplexes that specifically target COX subunit Vb were designed and obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). A non-sense siRNA was used as control. We used two different siRNA duplexes (one against the open reading frame and one against an untranslated region) because some siRNAs may have multiple effects, may not work against the intended mRNA, or may exhibit nonspecific silencing. The first target sequence was AAAGUAGGCUGCAUCUGUGAA. The corresponding siRNA duplex 1 (s1) was 21 nucleotides. Its sense sequence was 5′-AGUAGGCUGCAUCUGUGAAdTdT-3′; the antisense sequence was 5′-UUCACAGAUGCAGCCUACUdTdT-3′. The second target sequence was AACAGUAAAGACUAGCCAUUG. The corresponding siRNA duplex 2 (s2) was also 21 nucleotides. Its sense sequence was 5′-CAGUAAAGACUAGCCAUUGdTdT-3′; the antisense sequence was 5′-CAAUGGCUAGUCUUUACUGdTdT-3′.One day before transfection, HeLa-80 cells were seeded at subconfluent density (8 × 104 cells per well in 6-well cell culture plates). During and after exposure to siRNA, the cultures were fed with enriched DMEM (10% FBS, supplemented with 4 g/liter glucose, 100 μg/ml pyruvate, and 50 μg/ml uridine) because substantial blockade of mitochondrial respiration might result in respiratory insufficiency and cell death. Control cultures were also fed with the same enriched medium. Transfection with siRNA was done with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's guidelines with some modifications. We also carried out Oligofectamine controls with or without nonsense siRNA. Cells were further incubated for 48 h at 37 °C after transfection. To ensure siRNA effectiveness, cells were processed for the evaluation of changes in COX subunit protein expression (Western blot) and mRNA by real time RT-PCR (as above).Effects of Vb siRNA on COX Activity and ROS Production—Two different concentrations of siRNA of COX Vb (20 and 100 nm) were used in the experiments along with Oligofectamine controls with or without non-sense siRNA. Cells were further incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2 after transfection. Then the cells were collected and processed as described above. COX activities were measured, and ROS production was estimated in control cells and siRNA-treated cells (as above).Survival and Growth of siRNA-transfected Cells under Normoxia and Hyperoxia—We cultured control cells and siRNA-treated cells under both 20% O2 and 80% O2 for 6 days. Exposure to hyperoxia was performed as described above. Cells were seeded at a density of ∼10% confluence, and cell numbers were estimated by microscopy (as described above) as well as Alamar Blue reduction as described previously (13Campian J.L. Gao X. Qian M. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46580-46587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Transfection and Overexpression of COX Subunit Vb in Oxygen-sensitive HeLa-20 Cells—Full-length cDNA for COX subunit Vb was obtained by RT-PCR, and the open reading frame was ligated into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO-TA expression vector. For the PCR amplification reactions, Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) was employed as follows: denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s; annealing at 56 °C, 30 s; and elongation at 72 °C, 1 min; 30 cycles. A 10-min extension at 72 °C was included after the last cycle to ensure that all PCR products were full length. The recombinant vector was transfected into TOP10 Escherichia coli that was selected for ampicillin resistance. All PCR products and plasmids were analyzed and verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing for the presence and orientation of PCR inserts.Using the TOPO cloning system, we employed the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression system (Invitrogen) to overexpress Vb in HeLa-20 cells. With this system, a Taq polymerase-amplified PCR product is directly inserted into the expression vector. The vector contains a cytomegalovirus promoter allowing high level expression. The TOPO vector contains both an ampicillin resistance gene (for selection in E. coli) and a neomycin (G418) resistance gene (for selection of stable transfectants). Cells were transfected with verified plasmids containing the entire open reading frame of COX subunit cDNA (2 μg per 1–3 × 105 cells) using FuGENE 6. As a control, cells were also transfected with empty vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His without an insert. The vector containing COX Vb sequence was transfected into oxygen-sensitive HeLa-20 cells. To establish stable cell lines, transfected cells were cultured in a selection medium containing 400 μg/ml neomycin (G418) (Sigma) for 2–4 weeks. Resulting colonies were further selected with 400 μg/ml G418 in order to obtain single stably transfected clones. These cells were cultured in the continuous presence of G418 (400 μg/ml). Several stable clones expressing selected COX subunit and nonexpression clones containing empty vector were selected.Functional Tests of Overexpression of COX Subunit Vb—The level of Vb expression of individual clones was analyzed by Western blot analysis using a specific antibody for COX subunit Vb as described above. COX activity was measured in these clones, and several of these (in which Vb was overexpressed 2–4-fold) were selected for subsequent experiments. ROS production was detected in selected clones under both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions (as above). Survival and growth in hyperoxia were tested by exposure of clones to 80% oxygen. A negative control of oxygen-sensitive HeLa-20 cells and a positive control of oxygen-tolerant HeLa-80 cells were also used in addition to cells treated with the empty vector.Immunostaining of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen—Cell proliferation was evaluated by detecting PCNA in cells grown in 24-well plates under either 20 or 80% oxygen. After 6 days of growth, cells were fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde. After washing with PBS, cells were heated to 95 °C for 30 min in citrate buffer (10 mm sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0). After cooling and PBS washing, the cells were incubated with normal horse serum blocking solution for 30 min, and finally, a peroxidase blocking solution (3% H2O2 in PBS) was added for 10 min to eliminate unspecific peroxidase reaction. Immunostaining was performed by incubating the fixed cells with the primary antibody for 30 min (mouse anti-PCNA, IgG2a, PC10; Vector Laboratories) and subsequently with the secondary antibody for 30 min (Biotinylated Universal Antibody from Vector Laboratories). The revealing reagents were provided by a commercial kit (Vectastain ABC Elite, Vector Laboratories). Finally, diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate solution (Sigma) was added, and samples were observed by light microscopy immediately.Oxygen Consumption—HeLa cell cultures in 10-cm dishes (>90% confluent) were washed with PBS, detached with trypsin/EDTA, and washed (1,000 × g for 8 min) in complete culture medium. Oxygen consumption was measured using a Gilson oxygraph with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Respiration rates were measured using 2–3 × 106 cells suspended in a total volume of 3.0 ml of complete culture medium containing 10% FBS and supplemented with 17 mm glutamate at 37 °C. A starting O2 concentration of 240 μm was assumed based on O2 solubility at sea level at 37 °C (22Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Statistics Analysis—Analysis of differences between groups was done by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Analyses between multiple groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance. Results were expressed as means ± 1 S.D.RESULTSCOX Subunit Vb Is Overexpressed in HeLa-80 Cells—We reported previously that the elevated COX activity in oxygentolerant HeLa-80 cells is associated with diminished mitochondrial ROS production and lessened hyperoxic damage (13Campian J.L. Gao X. Qian M. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46580-46587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) through which COX activity was increased remained unknown. COX consists of 13 subunits variously encoded by mitochondrial and nuclear DNA as described above. The larger subunits (I, II, and III) are involved in the catalytic activity of COX, and the smaller subunits are important in its regulation (23Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). To determine the reason(s) for the increased COX activity in HeLa-80 cells, we carried out analyses of the differential expression of COX subunits in HeLa-20 and HeLa-80 cells by Western blotting analyses. Western blots of 11 of the 13 subunits of COX (antibodies against two of these were not available) indicated that only COX subunit Vb was significantly increased (>2-fold) (Fig. 1). This may be a critical observation because this subunit and its yeast homologue have been indicated as important in the regulation of overall COX activity and proper assembly of COX (24Beauchemin A.M.J.

Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z. Marusich M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7688-7693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the mRNA expression for each of the 13 subunits, including Vb, was similar (data not shown). This is surprising given the elevated levels of Vb protein and suggests either enhanced translation efficiency or increased stability of the protein product (although there are other possible explanations).COX Subunit Vb Is Selectively Suppressed in HeLa-80 Cells by siRNA—siRNA transfection was used as a means to specifically and directly test whether the overexpressed COX Vb in HeLa-80 cells might lead to an overall increase in COX activity. The effects of siRNA on Vb expression were determined following 48 h of exposure to siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2, Western blots revealed significantly decreased COX Vb in siRNA-treated HeLa-80 cells, and the extent of inhibition of expression was dependent on the dose of siRNA. In similar experiments, we also determined by Western blot the expression levels of several other COX subunits (I and II that are mitochondrial products and Va and VIb that are nuclear products). No significant changes in the expression of"

Utilization of nitrogen from nonpeptide carbon-nitrogen compounds usually involves nitrilase or nitrile hydratase coupled with amidase to produce ammonia for further assimilation or transfer (1Willison J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 10: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on multiple sequence analysis, nitrilases, cyanide hydratases, and aliphatic amidases, along with β-alanine synthases that reduce organic nitrogen compounds are found to possess several conserved sequence features, including an invariant cysteine active residue (2Bork P.

The first determined structure of the nitrilase (Nit) domain is from worm NitFhit that shows a tetramer, and each Nit domain has a four-layer α-β-β-α sandwich fold (3Pace H.C. Hodawadekar S.C. Draganescu A. Huang J. Bieganowski P. Pekarsky Y. Croce C.M. Brenner C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Additionally, a novel Cys-Glu-Lys (CEK) triad that contains the highly conserved cysteine is seen in a solvent-accessible pocket. Crystal structures of N-carbamoyl d-amino acid amidohydrolase reveal a homologous fold, in which the CEK triad is also found (4Nakai T. Hasegawa T. Yamashita E. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Ueki T.

Biol. 2001; 306: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Structural and site-directed mutagenesis results suggest the roles of the CEK residues; the active cysteine acts as the nucleophile, glutamate mediates the proton transfer, and lysine stabilizes a tetrahedral transition state (6Chen C.Y. Chiu W.C. Liu J.S. Hsu W.H. Wang W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26194-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Grifantini R. Pratesi C. Galli G. Grandi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9326-9331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such a novel catalytic triad had not been observed in any other hydrolytic enzymes. In 2001, Pace and Brenner (8Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-9Crossref Google Scholar) defined these proteins having the strictly conserved CEK site as the nitrilase superfamily. On the basis of sequence similarity and the presence of additional domains, 13 branches can be classified, nine of which have known or deduced specificity for specific nitrile or amide hydrolysis or amide condensation reactions, including nitrilase, aliphatic amidase, N-terminal amidase, biotinidase, β-ureidopropionase, carbamoylase, glutaminase domain of glutaminedependent NAD synthetase, and apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase. Subsequently, structures from two members of the nitrilase superfamily (a yeast hypothetical protein with sequence homologous to CN hydralase from yeast (9Kumaran D. Eswaramoorthy S. Gerchman S.E. Kycia H. Studier F.W. Swaminathan S. Proteins. 2003; 52: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and a hypothetical protein from Pyrococcus horikoshii (10Sakai N. Tajika Y. Yao M. Watanabe N. Tanaka I. Proteins. 2004; 57: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) show the characteristic α-β-β-α sandwich architecture. Given the functional diversity and the wide evolutionary distribution of the nitrilase superfamily members, we sought to investigate the structure-function relationship of Helicobacter pylori formamidase AmiF that shows restricted substrate specificity. H. pylori is a human gastric pathogen that persistently colonizes the mucus layer overlaying the epithelium of the stomach. AmiF and the other paralogue AmiE, along with urease, play a major role in producing ammonia to protect against gastric acidity or as a nitrogen source or a cytotoxic molecule, enabling H. pylori to adapt into such an exclusive environment (11Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 596-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In response to growth at mild acidic conditions, genes encoding these proteins are up-regulated (13van Vliet A.H. Kuipers E.J. Stoof J. Poppelaars S.W. Kusters J.G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Bury-Mone S. Thiberge J.M. Contreras M. Maitournam A. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Both AmiF and AmiE belong to members of aliphatic amidases. The presumed invariant active cysteine is identified as Cys165 for AmiE and Cys166 for AmiF from site-directed mutagenesis studies (12Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 596-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Additionally, AmiF is noted to demonstrate restricted substrate specificity in which formamide is its only known substrate. Here we report the 1.75 Å crystal structure of the native AmiF. Crystal structures of an inactive mutant AmiF C166S were also determined in its apo and liganded forms. Structural analysis reveals a small binding pocket that has the key CEK catalytic residues to reduce the organic nitrogen compounds efficiently. Cloning, Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification—The gene (amiF) encoding formamidase was amplified from chromosomal DNA of H. pylori 26695 by PCR using pfu DNA polymerase and inserted into the pQE30 expression vector to generate pQE30-AmiF. Primers (AmiF-F, 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGGAAGTATCGGTAGT-3′); AmiF-R, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGTTATTTCCCAAAACG-3′) that contain sequences for the BamHI site and HindIII site, respectively, were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the reported amiF gene of H. pylori 26695 (accession number NC_000915) (15Tomb J.F.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed essentially using the method of overlap extension PCR with plasmid pQE30-AmiF as the template (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 17Chiu W.C. You J.Y. Liu J.S. Hsu S.K. Hsu W.H. Shih C.H. Hwang J.K. Wang W.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the whole ligated PCR fragment. Expression of wild-type AmiF or the C166S mutant in Escherichia coli JM109 cells transformed with pQE30-AmiF or pQE30-C166S was induced at 37 °C. Bacterial pellets were fractionated, and soluble proteins in cytosolic fractions were collected. The expressed protein with a His6 tag was purified by immobilized nickel-ion chromatography, followed by MonoQ ion exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare), and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE to verify the purity. The protein concentration was assayed according to the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Expression of selenomethionine-labeled AmiF (Se-Met-AmiF) 3The abbreviations used are: Se-Met, selenomethionine; Nit, nitrilase; PEG, polyethylene glycol; GNM, Gaussian network model; r.m.s., root mean square; MME, monomethyl ether. was done essentially described by Yang et al. (19Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Kalman E.T. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13553-13559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Van Duyne et al. (20Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). In brief, an overnight culture of transformed E. coli JM109 was grown in 1 liter of LB medium and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. The cells from the overnight culture were harvested and resuspended in 1 liter of M9 medium (12.8 g/liter Na2HPO4, 3 g/liter K2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 1 g/liter NH4Cl). Twenty ml of M9-add (20% glucose, 1 m MgSO4, 1 m CaCl2, 0.5% thiamine, 100 mg/liter ampicillin) were then added per liter of culture. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached A600 nm = 0.6, 10 ml of Met-shutdown mix (100 mg/liter lysine hydrochloride, 100 mg/liter threonine, 100 mg/liter phenylalanine, 50 mg/liter leucine, 50 mg/liter isoleucine, 50 mg/liter valine, 120 mg/liter seleno-l-methionine) were added per liter of culture. The culture was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-dgalactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Purification of Se-Met-AmiF was performed based on the procedures for the native AmiF. Crystallization—All crystallization was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. Initial crystallization conditions were screened using Crystal Screen I and II kits (Hampton Research) and Clear Strategy Screen I and II kits (Molecular Dimension). One μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was mixed with an equal volume of the well precipitant. The best diffracting AmiF crystals were found in a modified solution containing 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 0.15 m potassium thiocynate, and 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 550 MME. The crystal grew as rods and reached a maximum size of about 0.6 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm within 2 days at 20 °C. The native crystal was characterized as belonging to space group R3, with the unit cell dimensions a = b = 147.21, c = 72.27 Å. There are two molecules per asymmetric unit. Crystals of the Se-Met-AmiF protein were obtained in a condition (0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.0), 0.8 m sodium formate, 8% PEG 20,000, and PEG 550 MME) using Se-Met-AmiF (20 mg/ml). Rod-shaped crystals with a maximum size of about 0.6 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm grew within 4 days at 20 °C. The Se-Met-AmiF crystal also belongs to space group R3 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 147.80 Å and c = 72.78 Å. Crystals of C166S were obtained in a solution containing 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.2 m lithium sulfate, and 14% PEG 2000 MME. Of two crystal forms (thin plates or rods), only the thin plate crystal diffracted beyond 3 Å using the in-house x-ray source. The thin plate crystal was characterized as space group C2, with the unit cell dimensions of a = 117.72, b = 130.53, c = 144.59 Å, and β = 99.44°. There are six molecules per asymmetric unit. Attempts to obtain liganded C166S crystals using the soaking method failed. After extensive trials, the C166S complex crystal was finally obtained by the co-crystallization method in a solution containing 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 6% PEG 1500, and 3 mm formamide. The complex crystal grew as a rod and was characterized as the space group P21 with cell dimensions of a = 83.09, b = 151.80, c = 89.08 Å, and β = 114.99°. There are six molecules per asymmetric unit. Data Collection—Prior to data collection, crystals were dipped into Fomblin® cryoprotectant oil for several seconds and then flash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream. Diffraction data were collected using a MSC X-Stream cryosystem and an R-AXIS IV++ image plate system with double mirror-focused CuKα x-ray radiation generated from a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode generator at the Macromolecular X-ray Crystallographic Laboratory of National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. The 1.75 Å native data set, the 2.27 Å Se-Met-AmiF data set, the 2.50 Å C166S data set, and the 2.30 Å C166S complex data set were collected on the BL12B2 Taiwan beamline at SPring-8, Japan, using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector. All data sets were collected at -165 °C and processed with the HKL/HKL2000 suite (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Structure Description of the Native AmiF—The 1.75 Å resolution electron density map of AmiF revealed two molecules (AB) per asymmetric unit. Except for the N-terminal segment (residues 1-12) that contained weak or negative density and could not be built into the model, the main-chain and sidechain atoms from 13 to 334 residues are well defined in A and B subunits. Only one residue, Cys166, lies in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot, despite its low B factor. The unusual geometry is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds around this peptide unit: Cys166 O···N Asp168, Cys166 O···N Gly169, and Cys166 O···Nη2 Arg188. The final model was refined to an R value of 17.4% (Rfree = 21.5%; Table 1). The average B-factor for all polypeptide atoms is 23.6 Å2. In the crystal structure, AmiF is a hexamer (Fig. 1): Subunit A and Subunit B associate into an AB dimer related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 1B). Along the 3-fold axis, three AB dimers assemble into a hexamer (A1B1A2B2A3B3) (Fig. 1A). The overall shape of each trimer (A1A2A3 or B1B2B3) is approximately an equilateral triangular prism (∼95 Å along the prism axis). Each monomer folds into a four-layer α-β-β-α structure, characteristic of members in the nitrilase superfamily (Fig. 2, A and B). One exterior α layer (α1 and α2) is solvent-accessible to shield the inner β sheets from the solvent, whereas the other α layer (α3-α7) associates with the neighboring Subunit B. One side of the four-layer sandwich contains short turns or loops to connect the secondary elements, whereas the other side has several long loops, particularly the β2-η1-α2, β5-β6, and β9-β10 segments. Buried residues at the A-B intersubunit interface are largely from residues of the β5-β6 loop, near or in those of α3-α7 helices and the C-terminal region of each monomer. The symmetric assembly (α3 versus α3, α4 versus α4, and α7 versus α7) forms a tightly associated α-β-β-α-α-β-β-α dimer (Fig. 1B). In total, there are 456 interactions within 3.8 Å, including 36 hydrogen bonds and 13 salt bridges. The total solvent-accessible surface of the AB dimer is ∼29,700 Å2, calculated by protein interfaces, surfaces, and assemblies service PISA at the European Bioinformatics Institute (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html). Of the subunit surface area, 28.8% is used for the formation of the dimer. Crystal Structures of C166S—To obtain liganded structures, crystallization trials using the co-crystallization or soaking methods in the presence of various concentrations of formamide were attempted. Of various structures, only one showed additional nonpeptide electron density near Cys166 (data not shown). Given the relatively large peak, either formamide or a solvent cacodylate molecule could be docked into this density in either subunit. Nonetheless, a piece of residual density that could not be ignored is present in either model, indicating a possibility that formamide and cacodylate co-exist in this density. However, we were not able to model both properly into this density, possibly due to the disordered formamide/cacodylate displacement. To further clarify the catalytic site, we have obtained the crystal structure of an inactive mutant, C166S, in a crystallization condition without cacodylate. The model consists of six subunits. Like the wild-type structure, the N-terminal segment (residues 1-12) is not visible in each subunit. Disordered regions that could not be defined include the 283-288 region and residues in loops (A194, A249, A299, B194, B249, B298, C194, C226, C300, D194, D232, D248, D296, D298, E194, E298, F194, and F248).

We screened the first 2250 bp of the HAS2 promoter for transcription factor response elements (REs) in silico and found 1 cluster of 2 retinoic acid (RA) REs, 3 discrete NF-κB factors, and 12 Sp1 REs. In parallel, we scanned nine overlapping promoter regions in HaCaT human immortalized keratinocytes using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to identify binding of mediator, coactivator, and corepressor proteins and Sp1 transcription factor in response to all-trans-RA and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). We found that all-trans-RA modulated the binding of the RA receptor and several coregulators to the region containing the RARE cluster at position -1230. The importance of this region is supported in reporter gene assays by the all-trans-RA induction of the respective promoter region. Similarly, we showed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays as well as by gel-shift assays with nuclear extracts that TNF-α induced NF-κB binding to regions at positions -380, -1420, and -1890, demonstrated its association with RNA polymerase II and cofactor proteins, and confirmed the functionality of the respective promoter regions in vivo. These findings partially explain the induction of HAS2 mRNA by all-trans-RA and TNF-α and provide an example how the action of different transcription factor families can use the same cofactors.

Its unique physiochemical properties and its interactions with specific cell surface receptors provide HA with a central role in cellular migration, adhesion, and proliferation (3Tammi M.I. Day A.J. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). HA is synthesized by the enzymes HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3, located at the plasma membrane (4Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar).

In the skin epidermis the narrow extracellular space surrounding keratinocytes contains a high concentration of HA (6Tammi R. Ripellino J.A. Margolis R.U. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Investig.

Keratinocyte growth and differentiation in both the normal and diseased epidermis are regulated by endocrine and paracrine signaling molecules such as the nuclear hormone alltrans-RA and epidermal growth factor (7Saavalainen K.

Direct evidence for the biological role of HA in epidermal keratinocytes emerged by the finding that HAS2-mediated HA synthesis controls the migration rate of keratinocytes in scratch-wounded monolayer cultures (8Pienimäki J.P.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar). Like most members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, RARs contain two zinc finger motifs that form a characteristic DNA binding domain (11Shaffer P.L. Gewirth D.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2242-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and a carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain (12Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Ligand binding causes a conformational change within the ligand binding domain that leads to the displacement of corepressor proteins, such as nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) (13Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) and subsequent interaction with coactivator proteins, such as steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) (14Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coactivators link the ligand-activated RARs to enzymes displaying histone acetyltransferase activity, such as cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) (15Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The combined effect of these covalent modifications has a large impact on chromatin organization and accessibility of transcription factor binding sites (16Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). In a subsequent step RARs interact with proteins of the mediator (MED) complex, such as MED1 (17Yuan C.-X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.-Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family, member 1 (PARP1) (18Pavri R. Lewis B. Kim T.K. Dilworth F.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. de Murcia G. Evans R. Chambon P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), which act as a bridge to the basal transcription machinery having Pol II as its core (19Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Näär A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Preferentially, RARs form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor, another nuclear receptor family member that also contacts DNA (20Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar) with hexameric DNA motifs containing the consensus sequence RGKTCA (R = AorG,K = G or T), arranged as a direct repeat with five intervening nucleotides (DR5) (21Schräder M. Wyss A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Grippo J.F. LeMotte P. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An essential prerequisite for the direct modulation of transcription via all-trans-RA is the location of activated RARs close to the basal transcriptional machinery. Therefore, the presence of RAREs is predicted within the activated chromatin regions in the promoters of RA target genes.NF-κB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the expression of various inducible target genes that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune and inflammatory responses. The transcription factor is a member of the Rel protein family, of which the most common member is formed by a p50/p65 heterodimer (22Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In non-stimulated cells, the heterodimeric NF-κB complex is sequestered in the cytoplasm of most cell types by inhibitory proteins of the IκB family (23Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). These inhibitors mask the NF-κB nuclear localization domain and inhibit its DNA binding activity. In response to a large variety of stimuli, such as TNF-α, the IκB inhibitor is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded. This allows NF-κB nuclear translocation, DNA binding to REs of the consensus sequence GGGRNNYYCC (Y = C or T, N = any base), and contact with coactivator and MED proteins (24Karin M. Mol. Carcinog. 2006; 45: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).In contrast to nuclear receptors and NF-κB factors, the Sp1-like proteins are constitutively active transcription factors (25Turner J. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed and binds to GC-rich REs and, therefore, regulates a large number of “housekeeping” genes that have GC-rich promoters whose products take part in nearly all cellular functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and neoplastic transformation (26Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The members of the Sp1-like family regulate transcription by interacting with coactivators, such as CBP, involving histone acetylation (27Song C.Z. Keller K. Murata K. Asano H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7029-7036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Zhang W. Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2413-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).The proximal promoter region of all three HAS genes show constitutive activity, of which HAS2 has the lowest basal level (29Monslow J. Williams J.D. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Craig K.J. Williams H.J. Williams N.M. Martin J. Coleman S.L. Topley N. Spicer A.P. Buckland P.R. Davies M. Bowen T. J. Biol.

Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and therefore, the HAS2 gene seems to be the main candidate for modulating HA synthesis rate by external stimuli. In this study we screened the first 2250 bp of the HAS2 promoter for transcription factor REs in silico and identified a cluster of 2 putative RAREs and 3 possible NF-κB REs as well as 12 candidate Sp1 REs. In parallel, we scanned nine overlapping promoter regions by ChIP assays in HaCaT cells for the binding of MED, coactivator, corepressor, and Sp1 proteins. We demonstrated all-trans-RA-induced binding of RARγ to a promoter region that contains the RARE cluster, showed its association with Pol II and several cofactor proteins, and confirmed the induction of the respective promoter region by all-trans-RA. Similarly, we showed NF-κB binding to three regions of the promoter, demonstrated its association with Pol II and cofactor proteins, and confirmed the functionality of the respective promoter regions. These findings partially explain the induction of human HAS2 gene mRNA by all-trans-RA and TNF-α and provide an example of how the action of different transcription factor families can use the same cofactors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The human immortalized keratinocyte HaCaT cell line (31Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Before mRNA extraction, nuclear extract preparation, or ChIP assays, HaCaT cells were treated at a density of 50-60% confluence for 0-240 min with solvent, 0.1 μm all-trans-RA (Sigma), 20 or 30 ng/ml recombinant TNF-α (Calbiochem), and 10 μm IKK-2 inhibitor (Calbiochem) alone or in combination. The medium was then supplemented with stock solutions of the compounds and was not changed at the moment of cell stimulation.ChIP Assays—Nuclear proteins were cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde directly to the medium to a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.15 m and incubating for 5 min at room temperature on a rocking platform. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, 50 nm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and the lysates were sonicated to result in DNA fragments of 300-1000 bp in length. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were diluted 1:10 in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Chromatin solutions were incubated with 5 μl of the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The antibodies against RARγ (sc-773), SRC-1 (sc-8995), MED1 (sc-5334), phosphorylated (p) RNA polymerase (pPol II; sc-13583), CBP (sc-369), NCoR (sc-8994), Sp1 (sc-14027), NF-κB p65 (sc-372), PARP1 (sc-25780), and control IgG (sc-2027) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Heidelberg, Germany). The immunocomplexes were collected with 60 μl of protein A-agarose slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 4 °C with 100 × g and washed sequentially for 4 min by rotation with 1 ml of the following buffers: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Finally, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of TE buffer (1 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). For re-ChIP, the immunocomplexes were eluted by adding 100 μl of re-ChIP elution buffer (10 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at room temperature with rotation, the supernatant was diluted 1:40 in ChIP dilution buffer, and the antibody against the second protein of interest was added. The new immunocomplexes were allowed to form by incubating overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform, collected by incubating with 120 μl of protein A-agarose slurry for 3 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform, and finally, were washed as indicated above. The immunocomplexes were then eluted by adding 500 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 100 mm NaHCO3) and incubating for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. The cross-linking was reversed by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm and incubating overnight at 65 °C. The remaining proteins were digested by adding proteinase K (final concentration 40 μg/ml) and incubation for 1 h at 45°C. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extractions and precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2 volumes of ethanol using glycogen as a carrier. Immunoprecipitated DNAs were then used as a template for PCR with the following profile: 5 min of preincubation at 94 °C and then 35 cycles (45 in case of primers for region 4) of 30-s denaturation at 95 °C, 30-s annealing at 60 °C, and 30-s elongation at 72 °C, with one final incubation for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR primers and the location of the investigated chromatin regions are listed in Table 1. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 2.0% agarose gels and quantified on a FLA-3000 reader (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) using ScienceLab99 software (Fuji).TABLE 1Genomic PCR primersRegionLocationPrimer sequence (5′ to 3′)1−32 to +57GGAGGCAGAAGGGCAACAACGTTCAATGGGCTGCTCGAAGC2−246 to −12CATTGGAGTTAGAACCGGCCGTTGTTGCCCTTCTGCCTCC3−481 to −244GTTACTTAGCTGAAGGGCACCGGCCGGTTCTAAACTCCAATG4−675 to −460GGCTTTGACACTTGACGTCAGGGTGCCCTTCAGCTAAGTAAC5−1048 to −655CAGTCATCAGCAGGCTTGTTGCTGACGTCAAGTGTCAAAGCC6−1338 to −1027GTGCGACGTGATGAAAGCATCCAACAAGCCTGCTGATGACTG7−1613 to −1318CACCTAGGCGGAGTTCAAACGATGCTTTCATCACGTCGCAC8−1896 to −1554GGTATTCCCGCATTACGTGTCCACTGATTTCCCCCAGCAAC9−2250 to −1874CTCCTGGGATCTCACAAACAGGACACGTAATGCGGGAATACC Open table in a new tab Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—HaCaT cells were seeded into 6-well plates (105 cells/ml) and grown overnight in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. The generation of a nested series of HAS2 promoter constructs was described previously (29Monslow J. Williams J.D. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Craig K.J. Williams H.J. Williams N.M. Martin J. Coleman S.L.

Plasmid DNA-containing liposomes were formed by incubating these reporter plasmids and pcDNA3-based expression vectors for human p50 and p65 (1 μg each) with 10 μg of N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,Ntrimethylammonium methyl sulfate (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 100 μl. After dilution with 900 μl of phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the liposomes were added to the cells. Phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 500 μl of 15% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was added 4 h after transfection. At this time either 0.1 μm all-trans-RA, 10 μm IKK-2 inhibitor, or 30 ng/ml TNF-α or solvent were also added. In combined treatments, IKK-2 inhibitor was added 30 min before the other stimulant. The cells were lysed 16 h after onset of stimulation using the reporter gene lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science), and the constant light signal luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as recommended by the supplier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The luciferase activities were normalized with respect to protein concentration, and induction factors were calculated as the ratio of luciferase activity of ligand-stimulated cells to that of solvent controls.Gel-shift Analysis—Gel-shift analysis was performed with extracts from HaCaT cells. Cells were harvested by mechanical scraping into 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of low salt buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, proteinase inhibitors). Cells were then resuspended in 2-3 packed volumes of the same low salt buffer with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and homogenized by pipetting on ice. The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in one packed cell volume of high salt buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, proteinase inhibitors). Extraction was performed for 30 min on ice. Gel-shift assays were performed with 10 μg of the nuclear extracts. The core sequence of the consensus NF-κB binding site was GGGACTTTCC. The core sequences of the putative NF-κB REs on HAS2 promoter are given in Fig. 1. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled by a Klenow fragment DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania)-mediated filling-in reaction in the presence of a nucleotide mixture containing radiolabeled [-α-32P]dCTP. Constant amounts (1 ng) of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (50,000 cpm) were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature. As a specificity control antip65 antibody was added 15 min after the nuclear extract to the DNA. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris-buffered EDTA (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and detected on a FLA-3000 reader.RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the Mini RNA Isolation II kit (HiSS Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany), and cDNA synthesis was performed for 1 h at 37 °C using 1 μg of total RNA as a template, 100 pmol of oligo(dT)18 primer and 40 units of reverse transcriptase (Fermentas). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in an IQ-cycler (Bio-Rad) using the dye SybrGreen I (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Per reaction, 1 unit of Hot Start Taq polymerase (Fermentas) and 3 mm MgCl2 were used, and the PCR cycling conditions were 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 56 °C (HAS2 and ribosomal protein, large, P0, RPLP0, also known as 36B4)) or 60 °C (matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13)) and 30 s at 72 °C. -Fold inductions were calculated using the formula 2-(ΔΔCt), where ΔΔCt is the ΔCt(stimulus) -ΔCt(solvent), ΔCt is Ct(HAS2/MMP13) - Ct(RPLP0), and Ct is the cycle at which the threshold is crossed. The genespecific primer pairs (and product sizes) were as follows: HAS2 gene forward, CAGAATCCAAACAGACAGTTC, and reverse, TAAGGTGTTGTGTGTGACTGA (186 bp); MMP13 gene forward, GAGGAAGACCTCCAGTTTGC, and reverse, CAGAGGAGTTACATCGGACC (357 bp); RPLP0 gene forward, AGATGCAGCAGATCCGCAT, and reverse, GTGGTGATACCTAAAGCCTG (318 bp). PCR product quality was monitored using post-PCR melt curve analysis.RESULTSThe Human HAS2 Promoter Contains Several Putative RAR, NF-κB, and Sp1 Binding Sites—The first 2250 bp of the human HAS2 promoter were screened in silico for putative RAR, NF-κB, and Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 1). For RARE identification, the promoter was screened for two copies of the RGKTCA consensus sequence in a DR5 arrangement. By restricting the maximal deviation from the consensus sequence to one position we identified a cluster of two overlapping RAREs located between positions -1208 to -1237 relative to the transcription start site (TSS). The use of the net-based program ConSite with a transcription factor score cutoff of 85% identified three putative NF-κB REs located at positions -375 to -384, -1417 to -1426, and -1888 to -1897 relative to the TSS. With the same cutoff of 85% ConSite identified 12 putative Sp1 REs within the same promoter region. To demonstrate the functionality of these and other transcription factor binding sites experimentally by ChIP assays, we designed genomic PCR primers (Table 1) specific for nine overlapping regions that covered the first 2250 bp of the HAS2 promoter. The location of these nine regions is shown in Fig. 1.Patterns of Transcriptional Regulator Recruitment to the Human HAS2 Promoter during Stimulation by RA and TNFα—The association of the MED protein MED1, the coactivators CBP and SRC-1, the corepressor NCoR, and the transcription factor Sp1 with the first 2250 bp of the human HAS2 promoter was monitored by ChIP assays with antibodies specific for the respective proteins (Fig. 2). For this purpose chromatin was extracted from HaCaT cells that had been treated for 0, 60, and 240 min with 0.1 μm all-trans-RA (Fig. 2A) or for 0 and 60 min with 30 ng/ml TNF-α (Fig. 2B). The nine genomic PCR primer pairs allowed the monitoring of the respective promoter regions (see Fig. 1). The resulting PCR products were quantified and expressed as % of input control, i.e. compared with the amount of PCR products obtained from non-immunoprecipitated chromatin templates. The specificity of the results was determined in relation to the maximal level of PCR products (2% of input) obtained on chromatin unspecifically binding to IgG, and therefore, we consider all signals above 2% of input value as being specific.FIGURE 2Recruitment of transcriptional regulators to the HAS2 promoter. Chromatin was extracted from HaCaT cells that had been treated with all-trans-RA (0, 60, and 240 min, 0.1 μm) (A) and with TNF-α (0 and 60 min, 30 ng/ml) (B). ChIP experiments were performed using anti-CBP, anti-MED1, anti-SRC-1, anti-NCoR, and anti-Sp1 antibodies. PCR was performed with primers specific for the nine regions of the human HAS2 promoter (Fig. 1); PCR conducted on DNA derived from input chromatin template served as a positive control (100% reference), and that on IgG-precipitated template as specificity control (all below the 2% threshold indicated by the dashed horizontal line). Bars represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the effects of RA stimulation on the human HAS2 promoter, in the first panel of ChIP assays (Fig. 2A) we found in the absence of ligand that the histone acetyltransferase CBP was already associated with promoter regions 6 (which contains the RARE cluster), 7 (where NF-κB RE2 resides), and 8 (that contains the NF-κB RE3). After 60 min of all-trans-RA treatment, CBP is found in regions 1 (TSS), 4, 5, and 6 (RARE cluster), whereas after 240 min it can be detected in regions 4, 6 (RARE cluster), 7, and 8 and 9 (both NF-κB RE3). Constitutive binding of the mediator protein MED1 was found only in region 3 (NF-κB RE1), whereas after 60 min all-trans RE treatment it can be detected also in regions 1 (TSS), 2, 3 (NF-κB RE1), and 8 and 9 (both NF-κB RE3). The same binding pattern was still observed after 240 min, except for binding to region 9, which was now absent. The coactivator SRC-1 showed ligand-independent binding to regions 1 (TSS), 5, 7 (NF-κB RE2), and 8 (NF-κB RE3). After 60 min of all-trans-RA stimulation SRC-1 associated with regions 2, 5, and 7 (NF-κB RE2), and after 240 min it was still in contact with regions 2, 5, 7 (NF-κB RE2), and 8 (NF-κB RE3). Before ligand treatment the corepressor NCoR was found in regions 2, 3 (NF-κB RE1), 7 (NF-κB RE2), and 8 and 9 (that both contain the NF-κB RE3 sequence). After 60 min of all-trans-RA treatment NCoR remained associated with regions 7 (NF-κB RE2), and 8 and 9 (both NF-κB RE3), but after"

The analyses indicate the existence of three different monomeric photosystem I complexes and also the high stability of photosystem I trimers.

The PsaK-less photosystem I monomer may represent an intermediate complex that is important for the exchange of the two PsaK variants during high light acclimation.

Its main function is the light-dependent electron transfer from plastocyanin or cytochrome c6 on the lumenal side to ferredoxin on the cytoplasmic or (in chloroplasts) on the stromal side of photosynthetic membranes. The crystal structures for cyanobacterial and plant PSI at 2.5 Å (1Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar) and 4.4 Å (2Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) resolution have improved the understanding of the function of this complex. The PSI subunits are designated PsaA-P, according to the corresponding psaA-P genes (3Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Rosgaard L. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 2003; 119: 313-321Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Fromme P. Mathis P. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 80: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Grotjohann I. Fromme P. Photosynth.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4808-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Their primary structures are well conserved among eukaryotes and prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis with the exception of five subunits not present in cyanobacteria (PsaG, PsaH, PsaN, PsaO, and PsaP) and one subunit PsaM, which has not been detected in plant PSI preparations. A heterodimer of two integral membrane proteins, PsaA and PsaB, forms the core of the PSI reaction center, which binds the electron transfer components P700, A0,A1, and FX. The terminal electron acceptors of PSI, the [4Fe-4S] centers FA and FB are bound to PsaC. PsaD and PsaE form, together with PsaC, peripheral ridges on the cytoplasmic and the stromal side, respectively, that provides a ferredoxin-docking site (7Kruip J. Chitnis P.R. Lagoutte B. Rögner M.

Acta. 2002; 1555: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PsaD is also required for the stable integration of PsaC, PsaL, and PsaE into the PSI complex (9Xu W. Tang H. Wang Y. Chitnis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PsaE is a structural component involved in ferredoxin reduction and cyclic electron flow around PSI. PsaF is exposed to the lumenal side of the thylakoids. It functions as a plastocyanin, or in cyanobacteria cytochrome c6, docking site of PSI and is required for efficient electron transfer from these proteins to P700+ (10Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PsaL is a subunit that forms most of the contacts between the monomers to form a trimer in cyanobacteria (12Karapetyan N.V. Holzwarth A.R. Rögner M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In contrast to cyanobacteria, trimeric PSI complexes have never been found in plants. Plant PsaL seems to be required for stable binding of PsaH and PsaO (3Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Rosgaard L. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 2003; 119: 313-321Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PsaI plays a role in the structural organization of the PsaL subunit of PSI. PsaJ interacts with PsaF and seems to be important for stabilizing PsaF (3Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Rosgaard L. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 2003; 119: 313-321Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Primary sequences of PsaK from higher plants and cyanobacteria do not show a high degree of similarity. PsaK in plants seems to be involved in the binding of light-harvesting complex I and in mediating state transitions (14Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys.

Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803) it was shown that one of the two existing PsaK variants functions in high light acclimation (17Fujimori T. Hihara Y. Sonoike K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22191-22197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the plant PSI complex depends on the coordinated expression of nuclear and plastid genes, the targeting of the subunits to their proper location within the chloroplast, the incorporation of the pigments and redox cofactors, and the correct assembly of the subunits to form a functionally active complex (18Rochaix J.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Rochaix J.D. Perron K. Dauvillee D. Laroche F. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Additional gene products have been identified by mutational analyses that may act as regulatory or scaffold proteins in the assembly of PSI. The conserved chloroplast open reading frames Ycf3, Ycf4, and Ycf37 along with specific cyanobacterial proteins like BtpA and RubA appear to be involved in posttranslational steps of PSI assembly. Ycf3 was shown to interact with PsaA and PsaD (20Naver H. Boudreau E. Rochaix J.D. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2731-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas Ycf4 is associated with a high molecular mass complex containing several PSI subunits (19Rochaix J.D. Perron K. Dauvillee D. Laroche F. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Ycf3 as well as ycf4 mutants from Chlamydomonas lack PSI complexes (21Boudreau E. Takahashi Y. Lemieux C. Turmel M. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A ycf4 mutant from Synechocystis 6803 still has functional PSI complexes but in lower amounts (22Wilde A. Härtel H. Hübschmann T. Hoffmann P. Shestakov S.V. Börner T. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A cyanobacterial ycf37 mutant lacks a specific PsaK-less PSI monomeric complex and contains only 70% trimeric PSI complexes when compared with wild-type thylakoids (23Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the other hand mutation of the plant ycf37-homolog pyg7 leads to a complete loss of functional PSI in Arabidopsis thaliana (24Stöckel J. Bennewitz S. Hein P. Oelmüller R. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria the cores of photosynthetic reaction centers are thought to be first assembled in the plasma membrane, before they are translocated to the thylakoid membrane. Several assembly factors and photosystem subunits were found to be present in the plasma membrane (25Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Klinkert B. Ossenbühl F. Sikorski M. Berry S. Eichacker L. Nickelsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44639-44644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the case of PSI a heterodimer of PsaA and PsaB most likely forms the folding center of PSI and provides the scaffold for other protein subunits to assemble. However, the detailed mechanism of biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus and the molecular function of the various assembly factors remains poorly understood. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 is an excellent model system to study PSI assembly. Cyanobacterial mutants often still accumulate impaired PSI complexes, whereas similar mutations in eukaryotic algae and plants lead to a complete loss of the complex. Using blue native (BN)-PAGE in combination with in vivo pulse-chase labeling of proteins we addressed the dynamics of PSI protein synthesis and assembly in Synechocystis 6803 wild-type and in the ycf37 mutant. We show the existence of three different monomeric PSI complexes: a short-lived PsaL/PsaK-less assembly intermediate, a strongly labeled PsaK-less complex, and a third complete monomer that contains all 11 subunits. Lack of the short-lived assembly intermediate as well as the absence of the PsaK-less monomeric complex in the ycf37 mutant suggests a function of the Ycf37 protein in formation or stabilization of these assembly/disassembly intermediates. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Liquid cultures of Synechocystis 6803 wild-type (S. Shestakov, Moscow State University) and mutant strains were grown photoautotrophically at 30 °C in BG-11 medium (27Rippka R. Desrulles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 11: 419-436Google Scholar) or photoheterotrophically (0.2% glucose) under continuous illumination with white light of 50 μmol photons m–2 s–1 and bubbled with air. The medium for the ycf37 (28Wilde A. Lünser K. Ossenbühl F. Nickelsen J. Börner T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and psaK2 (17Fujimori T. Hihara Y. Sonoike K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22191-22197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) mutant strains was supplemented with 7 μgml–1 chloramphenicol and 40 μgml–1 kanamycin, respectively. Pulse-Chase Labeling—Photoheterotrophically grown cells in the logarithmic growth phase were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in BG11 medium (supplemented with 8 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm Na2CO3, 25 mm TES, pH 8.0) to a final volume of 1.5 ml with a chlorophyll (Chl) concentration of 200 μgml–1. For the ycf37 mutant the final Chl concentration was adjusted to 150 μgml–1 (75% of the wild-type Chl level) to accommodate for the lower Chl content of this strain (28Wilde A. Lünser K. Ossenbühl F. Nickelsen J. Börner T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was preincubated at 5 μmol photons m–2 s–1 for 30 min at 30 °C in a water bath shaker. After the addition of l-[35S]methionine ([35S]Met) to a final concentration of 500 μCi ml–1 (1000 Ci mmol–1; Amersham Biosciences), cells were incubated for another 20 min under the same conditions. The labeling reaction was stopped by removal of unincorporated [35S]Met by centrifugation. Furthermore, lincomycin (final concentration 0.5 mg ml–1) as well as a 1000-fold excess of non-radioactive l-Met was added to block translation and labeling. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately. The remaining cells were illuminated either under high light (250 μmol m–2 s–1) or low light conditions (15 μmol m–2 s–1). Aliquots were taken after 1, 4, 8, and 22 h and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thylakoids were prepared as described (23Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). BN-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Thylakoid membranes (about 300 μg of protein) were sedimented by centrifugation (20 min, 15,000 × g, 4 °C) and resuspended in 50 μl of ACA buffer (50 mm BisTris/HCl, pH 7.0, 750 mm ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid, 0.5 mm EDTA). Membrane proteins were solubilized by the addition of 7 μl of freshly prepared 10% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside solution and incubation for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min), the supernatants were supplemented with 10 μl of a Coomassie Blue solution (5% (w/v) Serva Brilliant Blue G-250, 750 mm ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid) and loaded onto a 7% BN-gel. One-dimensional BN-PAGE and BN/Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE were carried out as described (29Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). If needed, bands of interest were excised from a one-dimensional BN-gel, placed on top of a resolving gel for SDS-PAGE, embedded in stacking gel, and subsequently separated by electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunodecorated with antibodies against PsaC (AgriSera, Vännäs, Sweden), PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, and PsaL. Monitoring of PSI Assembly Intermediates—BN-PAGE is a powerful tool to investigate membrane-bound protein complexes (29Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). This technique separates protein complexes by their size without dissociating them into their individual polypeptides. The integration and assembly of different subunits of PSII could thus be followed by pulse-chase radiolabeling of cells in combination with two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE (31Komenda J. Reisinger V. Muller B.C. Dobakova M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 32Ossenbühl F. Gohre V. Meurer J.

Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2236-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we used a similar method to analyze PSI assembly. Since PSI subunits do not accumulate as much label as subunits of PSII reaction centers, Synechocystis 6803 cells were incubated with [35S]Met under low light conditions to achieve higher labeling level of PSI proteins. As these are limiting growth conditions for the cells we supplemented the media with glucose to enhance growth rate. Photoheterotrophic growth conditions led to a faster protein synthesis and therefore to an optimized incorporation of [35S]Met. After the radioactive pulse the turnover of trimeric PSI complexes was enhanced during the chase by illumination with high light to detect potential monomeric degradation products. To characterize the previously described PsaK-less monomeric PSI complex PSI* (23Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), wild-type and ycf37 mutant cells were analyzed. Isolated thylakoid membranes were subjected to BN-PAGE. Seven radiolabeled protein complexes with a different electrophoretic mobility could be detected (Fig. 1). Two complexes were missing in the ycf37 mutant, suggesting that one of these complexes represents PSI*. The PSI trimer was labeled less intensely in the ycf37 mutant, whereas the amount of radioactivity in PSII complexes was comparable in wild-type and mutant thylakoids. The amount of radiolabel in the PSI trimer increased slightly during the chase, while label in the PSII complexes decreased, mainly due to the enhanced damage of PSII complexes and inhibition of the PSII repair under high light conditions (34Nishiyama Y. Allakhverdiev S.I. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Interestingly, radiolabel accumulated significantly in the PSI monomer during the chase, whereas the amount of label in PSI* did not change in wild-type thylakoids (Fig. 1). These results indicate a higher stability of PSI trimers in comparison to PSII complexes. Furthermore, PSI* and PSI trimers seem to be stable products of PSI assembly. The regular PSI monomer may represent a degradation intermediate and/or a pool of monomeric PSI complexes for recycling of the trimeric complex under high light conditions. Besides the well documented PSI complexes (PSI trimer, PSI monomer, PsaK-less PSI monomer (PSI*)) an additional radiolabeled complex with a slightly higher electrophoretic mobility than PSI* could be detected in the wild type but not in the ycf37 mutant (Fig. 1). As we detect this complex which we call PSI** only in the autoradiograms but not after Coomassie staining of the BN-gels, and since label in this complex disappears during chase time, we conclude that it represents an unstable and/or short-lived assembly intermediate. The Subunit Composition of Different PSI Complexes—We found that the newly detected short-lived assembly intermediate PSI** is missing in the ycf37 mutant and that it migrates slightly faster than the two previously characterized PSI monomers (23Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, PSI** could represent a PSI subcomplex lacking specific subunits. To detect differences in the subunit composition between the individual monomeric PSI complexes, the lanes of the BN-PAGE were subjected to a second denaturating electrophoresis. The silver-stained two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE gel is shown as a reference indicating the presence and localization of the individual subunits of the major protein complexes (Fig. 2A). The corresponding autoradiogram in Fig. 2B depicts the [35S]Met-labeled newly synthesized translation products and the presence of assembly intermediates. All PSI subunits (except PsaE, which does not contain a Met) incorporated [35S]Met and were detected in the PSI trimer and the regular PSI monomer, as is evident from comparison of the silver stained gel with the autoradiogram. Due to their small size it was not possible to exactly assign the polypeptides PsaM, PsaI, and PsaJ (Fig. 2). The next PSI subcomplex with decreasing size (PSI*) was identified in silver-stained gels as well as in the autoradiograms. This is characterized by the lack of PsaK. In addition, PsaF was poorly labeled in all PSI monomer complexes during pulse time (although PsaF contains one more Met than e.g. PsaL). During chase monomeric as well as trimeric PSI complexes incorporated relatively more [35S]Met-labeled PsaF, suggesting that a larger pool of unassembled PsaF is present in the thylakoid membrane. This suggests that PsaF can be independently exchanged between existing PSI complexes and this pool. The smallest detectable assembly intermediate PSI** which is visible only in the pulse samples seems to lack PsaK as well as PsaL. To clarify the presence of other PSI subunits that are poorly detectable in the autoradiogram we performed immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3) using an enriched PSI** fraction. The region of a BN-gel where PSI** migrates corresponding to the autoradiogram was excised and subjected to a second dimension. Immunoblot analysis indicate the presence of PsaF, PsaE, PsaD, and PsaC, wheras PsaL is clearly missing in the PSI** complex.FIGURE 3Immunodetection of the PSI subunits PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, and PsaL in monomeric PSI complexes. Protein complexes of solubilized wild-type thylakoid membranes were separated by BN-PAGE. The bands containing monomeric photosystem complexes were excised from the gel, embedded in the stacking gel, subjected to Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies used for the immunoblots are indicated on the right. To achieve a 4-fold enrichment of the short lived complex, the PSI** band was excised from a lane loaded with 600 μg of protein (150 μg of protein for the other PSI monomer bands).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our results suggest a rapid assembly of PSI** into PSI trimers most likely via PSI* as an intermediate. We conclude that PsaL and then PsaK are the last subunits of PSI to be assembled. Synechocystis 6803 contains two different PsaK proteins, of which PsaK1 is dominant under low light conditions, while PsaK2 is more abundant under high light conditions (17Fujimori T. Hihara Y. Sonoike K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22191-22197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, the incorporation of PsaK1/PsaK2 as final PSI subunit might make sense as a possible acclimation step during recycling of PSI complexes under changing light conditions. To verify this hypothesis we analyzed the presence of PSI* in psaK2 mutants under various light intensities. High light conditions lead to an increase of PSI* as was shown previously (23Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in the psaK2 mutant this accumulation is much more pronounced than in the wild type (Fig. 4), whereas low light did not induce an increase in the PSI* amount. Dynamics of PSI Complexes at Low and High Light Intensities—To follow the assembly/disassembly of PSI complexes under different light conditions we next performed in vivo labeling experiments with [35S]Met using different light conditions in the chase. Thylakoid membranes were isolated, solubilized, and thylakoid membrane complexes were analyzed by BN-PAGE (Fig. 5). Incubation at low light resulted in very stable photosystems. Accumulated radiolabel in assembled PSII monomers and dimers as well as trimeric PSI complexes remained constant over the whole chase period (Fig. 5A). In contrast, treating cells with high light led to degradation of photosynthetic complexes, in particular of PSII complexes due to its photoinactivation. However, no distinct accumulation of degradation products of the photosystems was detected during the chase at high light (Fig. 5B). In comparison to PSII and monomeric PSI complexes, PSI trimers showed the highest stability under high light conditions, with little decrease detectable up to 8 h of chase. Radiolabel in the regular PSI monomer was weak after the pulse in comparison to the other PSI complexes but increased continuously up to 4 h of chase. Possibly, this monomer represents an early intermediate of disintegrating trimers. In contrast to low light conditions after 4 h chase high light induced degradation of PSI and PSI* monomers (Fig. 5B). Thus, both complexes appear to be in a dynamic equilibrium with the trimers. Though structure and function of the PSI has been elucidated in detail (1Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 5Grotjohann I. Fromme P. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 85: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 35Chitnis P.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), its assembly, repair, and degradation are poorly understood. The functional significance of the recently discovered PSI monomer lacking the PsaK subunit (PSI*) (23Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) is also poorly established. In the current study the assembly and dynamics of PSI complexes have been analyzed in the wild type and the ycf37 mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 using pulse-chase experiments. Labeling of cyanobacterial cells was followed by a BN-PAGE analysis to examine the dynamics of assembly and disassembly intermediates of PSI complexes. This approach allowed us to detect three specific monomeric PSI complexes with different labeling (i.e. turnover) kinetics. Surprisingly, we detected only late assembly intermediates. These results may either indicate that the early assembly steps are very fast or that the assembly intermediates may not be stable enough to detect with our method. As shown in our model (Fig. 6) the first assembly intermediate detected following the synthesis of individual subunits and formation of the PSI core is a PsaL/PsaK-less PSI monomer (PSI**). The next step is the integration of the PsaL subunit into the complex resulting in the recently discovered PSI* intermediate. Finally, addition of PsaK leads to a complete PSI monomer consisting of all 11 PSI subunits. Hippler et al. (36Hippler M. Rimbault B. Takahashi Y. Protist. 2002; 153: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggested that in Chlamydomonas PsaK is also the last subunit assembled into PSI complexes (36Hippler M. Rimbault B. Takahashi Y. Protist. 2002; 153: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments suggest a homeostasis of trimeric and the two “late” monomeric complexes PSI and PSI*. The question remains why PsaK and not PsaL is the last subunit that is incorporated into the complex? PsaL is essential (but not sufficient) for trimerization of PSI in cyanobacteria. Thus, association of PsaL with a PSI monomer as a final step in the assembly of trimers would agree with this role. However, in plants PSI is a monomeric complex, although it contains PsaL. We suggest that the association of PsaL with PSI subassemblies does not always directly lead to trimerization but may also depend on the attachment of PsaK. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 contains two psaK genes, psaK1 and psaK2. The psaK2 mRNA is the only transcript of a PSI gene that accumulates under high light conditions (37Hihara Y. Kamei A. Kanehisa M. Kaplan A. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) suggesting that it is involved in responses to high light. PsaK has two transmembrane helices and is located peripherally, close to the interface between the monomers of a PSI trimer (1Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). It shares around 30% amino acid identity with PsaG, a plant PSI subunit that is lacking in cyanobacteria. Studies of psaG and psaK Arabidopsis mutants (14Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 2005; 1708: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have suggested a stabilizing role of these subunits for the PSI core and the peripheral antenna. In plants PsaG and PsaK are incorporated only under low light conditions, suggesting a particular role of peripheral subunits in light acclimation (39Rokka A. Suorsa M. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Aro E.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria PsaK2 was shown to be involved in excitation energy transfer from phycobilisomes to PSI under high light conditions (17Fujimori T. Hihara Y. Sonoike K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22191-22197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, Fujimori et al. (17Fujimori T. Hihara Y. Sonoike K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22191-22197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) observed that the amount of the PsaK2 subunit increased in PSI complexes of high light acclimated cells. PsaG as well as PsaK are located on the outer edge of the plant PSI complex. Since the space that is occupied by PsaG in plant PSI is empty in cyanobacterial PSI as judged from the crystal structure, Fujimori et al. (17Fujimori T. Hihara Y. Sonoike K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22191-22197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggested that PsaK2 could occupy this site under high light conditions. However, in thylakoids of high light acclimated cells we could not detect a stable third monomeric PSI complex (besides the regular PSI monomer and PSI*) that would contain both PsaK subunits (data not shown). To support our idea that PSI* is involved in the PsaK exchange process we analyzed PSI* accumulation in a psaK2 mutant. As expected Fig. 4 shows accumulation of the PsaK-less monomer in psaK2 mutants under high light conditions whereas under low light conditions no differences to the wild type were detected. Thus, in our model PsaK2 is assembled into PSI* under high light conditions at the expense of PsaK1, which is present under normal growth light (Fig. 6). In psaK2 mutants this PSI intermediate accumulates because of the inability of the cells to integrate PsaK2 during the acclimation process. We therefore suggest that PSI* has a dual role as a stable assembly product as well as an intermediate for exchange of the different PsaK subunits. A similar mechanism is known for the PSII subunit D1: high light induces the exchange of two different D1 proteins in cyanobacteria (40Clarke A.K. Soitamo A. Gustafsson P. Öquist G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9973-9977Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the existence of multiple D1 copies is not typical for all cyanobacteria (e.g. several Prochlorococcus strains). The same holds true for the PsaK subunit. Fujimori et al. (17Fujimori T. Hihara Y. Sonoike K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22191-22197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) searched for the two types of PsaK proteins in other cyanobacteria. They found that cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101 contain two types of the psaK gene, whereas the marine cyanobacterial strains Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus have only one psaK gene that forms a distinct clade in a phylogenetic tree. The Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 genome encodes even three psaK genes, one of the psaK1 type, whereas the other two are quite divergent from psaK2 and the marine type genes. These data imply that the assembly mechanism of different PsaK subunits into the PSI monomer is not specific to Synechocystis 6803 but is rather common in cyanobacterial strains that have to adapt to changing light conditions and that perform state transitions. However, the role of Ycf37 in the biogenesis of PSI is not specific to PsaK1/PsaK2 incorporation but has to be more vital, as this protein is found in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Proteomic analysis of high light acclimation responses in Arabidopsis indicated a pronounced up-regulation of the Ycf37 homolog Pyg7 (41Giacomelli L. Rudella A. van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These data support our conclusion that this protein has a specific role in cyanobacterial high light acclimation (23Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The inactivation of Pyg7 leads to a complete loss of all PSI complexes in Arabidopsis (24Stöckel J. Bennewitz S. Hein P. Oelmüller R. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, cyanobacterial ycf37 mutants contained fully assembled monomeric as well as trimeric PSI complexes, although in lower amounts. These results suggest that cyanobacteria are able to compensate more effectively for the lack of assembly factors, as was shown also for ycf4 (21Boudreau E. Takahashi Y. Lemieux C. Turmel M. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 22Wilde A. Härtel H. Hübschmann T. Hoffmann P. Shestakov S.V. Börner T.

Res. 2000; 63: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, the Synechocystis Ycf37 protein as well as Pyg7 from Arabidopsis were found to bind to PSI complexes (23Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Stöckel J. Bennewitz S. Hein P. Oelmüller R. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria it is known that the early steps of photosystem assembly occur in the plasma membrane (25Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast to other known PSI assembly factors like Ycf3 and Ycf4 that were found mainly in the plasma membrane, Ycf37 and also Pyg7 are located in the thylakoid membrane (24Stöckel J. Bennewitz S. Hein P. Oelmüller R. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 45Dühring U. Karradt A. Mikolajczyk S. Irrgang K.-D. Wilde A. van der Est A. Bruce D. Photosynthesis: Fundamental Aspects to Global Perspectives: Proceedings 13th International Congress on Photosynthesis. Alliance Communications Group Publishing, Montreal2005: 802-804Google Scholar). Therefore Ycf37 should rather act on later steps of PSI assembly. Most probably Ycf37 stabilizes late PSI assembly intermediates in the thylakoid membrane and protects them from premature degradation through proteolysis.

Recently, we reported that the less glycosylated form of Pmel17 (termed iPmel17) is sorted via the plasma membrane in a manner distinct from mature Pmel17 (termed mPmel17), which is sorted directly to melanosomes. To clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the distinct processing and sorting of Pmel17, we generated a highly specific antibody (termed αPEP25h) against an epitope within the repeat domain of Pmel17 that is sensitive to changes in O-glycosylation. αPEP25h recognizes only iPmel17 and allows analysis of the processing and sorting of iPmel17 when compared with αPEP13h, an antibody that recognizes both iPmel17 and mPmel17. Our novel findings using αPEP25h demonstrate that iPmel17 differs from mPmel17 not only in its sensitivity to endoglycosidase H, but also in the content of core 1 O-glycans modified with sialic acid. This evidence reveals that iPmel17 is glycosylated differently in the Golgi and that it is sorted through the secretory pathway. Analysis of Pmel17 processing in glycosylation-deficient mutant cells reveals that Pmel17 lacking the correct addition of sialic acid and galactose loses the ability to form fibrils. Furthermore, we show that addition of sialic acid affects the stability and sorting of Pmel17 and reduces pigmentation.

The human PMEL17 gene encodes two type I integral membrane proteins that are translated from alternatively spliced mRNAs.

Pmel17 is critical to the formation of an internal fibrillar matrix within stage II melanosomes that is essential to the maturation of that organelle and the subsequent synthesis and deposition of melanin within it.

It is rapidly and quantitatively glycosylated to an “immature” ∼95-kDa form (termed iPmel17), but only a limited amount is further processed to a “mature” ∼115-kDa form (termed mPmel17), due at least in part to N-glycosylation at five possible sites (4Yasumoto K.

N-Linked core glycosylation begins in the ER and is essential for the function, stability, folding, intracellular transport, and secretion of glycoproteins (for review see Ref. 7Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: R43-R56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Upon arrival in the cis-Golgi, the initial mannose-rich core chains are trimmed by mannosidases I and II to continue N-glycosylation and O-linked glycosylation starts but may occur at multiple sites within the Golgi (8Rottger S.

In the medial- and trans-Golgi, the formation of complex type glycans ensues, which is terminated by the addition of sialic acid or other sugars. Sialyltransferases are responsible for the addition of sialic acid. Changes in the expression and enzyme activity of ST3Gal I and ST6Gal II, which catalyze the addition of sialic acid in positions α2,3 or α2,6, respectively, are associated with alterations in the length and structure of glycoproteins in several tumors and have been associated with malignant potential (9Naim H.Y.

In melanoma cells, altered sialylation of surface glycoconjugates has been associated with a highly metastatic phenotype (11Bosmann H.B. Bieber G.F. Brown A.E. Case K.R. Gersten D.M. Kimmerer T.W.

Despite the importance of sialic acid addition, no study has reported sialyltransferase activity or its role in the sorting of melanosome-specific proteins in various types of melanocytic cells. N-Glycans on Pmel17 contains a mixture of complex, hybrid, and mannose-rich carbohydrate chains that distinguish its secreted and cytoplasmic forms (3Maresh G.A. Wang W.-C. Beam K.S. Malacko A.R. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. Marquardt H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, no information for the O-glycan content of Pmel17 is available. Recently, we reported that a glycoform of Pmel17 (iPmel17) is sorted via the plasma membrane in a manner distinct from mPmel17, which is sorted directly to melanosomes (14Valencia J.C. Watabe H. Chi A. Rouzaud F. Chen K.G. Vieira W.D. Takahashi K. Yamaguchi Y. Berens W. Nagashima K. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1080-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that Pmel17 can be glycosylated differently and that those forms may have distinct functions. The phenomenon that any given glycosylation site on a given protein synthesized by a particular cell type can have a range of variations in the precise glycan structure is known as microheterogeneity (15Varki A.P. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology.1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). To date, there have been no reports that address this issue regarding melanosome-specific proteins. The putative function(s) of iPmel17, which is the major form of Pmel17 seen in pigmented cells, is a matter of conjecture and controversy at this point (16Theos A.C. Truschel S.T. Tenza D. Hurbain I. Harper D.C. Berson J.F. Thomas P.C. Raposo G. Marks M.S. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 17Valencia J.C. Hoashi T. Pawelek J.M. Solano F. Hearing V.J. Pigm. Cell Res. 2006; 19: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The rapid processing of Pmel17 and the lack of in depth glycosylation studies have been impediments to elucidating mechanisms involved in the complex processing, trafficking, and functions of the various forms of Pmel17. To develop another tool to resolve some of these issues, we designed a highly specific antibody against a peptide sequence in the core region of Pmel17. That antibody, termed αPEP25h, specifically recognizes iPmel17 and has allowed us to characterize the different processing events that generate this important fragment. Reactivity with αPEP25h can be blocked by glycosylation at residues adjacent to its epitope, allowing us to study iPmel17 processing and sorting compared with mPmel17 that is recognized by αPEP13h. We demonstrate for the first time that iPmel17 differs from mPmel17 by having different sialylated core 1 O-glycans. Furthermore, we show that Pmel17 deficient in sialic acid and galactose loses the ability to form fibrils, and thus the addition of sialic acid at the α2,3-position is an important determinant of Pmel17 sorting through the secretory pathway. Cell Cultures, Human Tissue Samples, and Skin Biopsies—Pigmented (MNT-1) human malignant melanoma cells and HeLa cells were cultured as described previously (18Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Valencia J.C.

Cell extracts from neuroblastoma cell lines (SKNAS and SKNSH) were gifts from Dr. Maria Tsokos, NCI, National Institutes of Health. The human melanocyte cell line M253 was cultured in 154 Medium supplemented with growth factors as described by Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR). Paraffin-embedded samples from human kidney, uterus, and lung were obtained from the tissue bank in Philadelphia. Shave biopsies, 4 mm in diameter, were taken before and 1 day after a 1 minimum erythema dose of UV radiation, as described previously (22Tadokoro T. Kobayashi N. Zmudzka B.Z. Ito S. Wakamatsu K.

Peptides used for affinity purification were synthesized by the solid phase method with 9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl chemistry using a 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each peptide was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C-4 column with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/water/acetonitrile. The mass of each peptide was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Micromass, Beverly, MA). Sera from immunized rabbits were affinity-purified using each peptide coupled with SulfoLink (Pierce). The specificity of each antibody was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using synthetic peptides. Monoclonal antibodies used include HMB-45 against Pmel17 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), HMB-50 and MART1 (Neomarkers, UK), and anti-V5 (Invitrogen). Other monoclonal antibodies used as intracellular organelle markers are as follows: BIP (ER), Vti1b (Golgi), clathrin, and adaptin α (AP2) all from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mass Spectrometry—Immunoprecipitated samples were separated on Tris-glycine gels and stained with the colloidal blue staining kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Retrieved protein bands were reduced, carbam-idomethylated, and in-gel digested with trypsin using the Montage In-Gel DigestZP kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Peptide separation was performed at 300 nl/min and was coupled to on-line analysis by nanoflow liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry on an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray ion source. From the eluted peptides, 2 μl were loaded onto a 0.075 × 50 mm PicoFrit BioBasic C18 packed tip column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) using the Paradigm MS4 MDLC (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). Elution of peptides into the mass spectrometer was performed with a linear gradient from 95% mobile phase A (5% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, 94.95% water) to 65% mobile phase B (5% water, 0.5% acetic acid, 94.95% acetonitrile) in 45 min and then to 95% mobile phase B in 5 min. Tandem mass spectra were searched against the human NCBI data base using TurboSEQUEST in BioWorks version 3.2 (ThermoElectron, San Jose, CA). Fluorescence and Electron Microscopy—For dual immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown in 2-well chamber slides (Nalgene, Naperville, IL) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Texas Red anti-rabbit or fluorescein isothiocyanate streptavidin for polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, respectively (25Valencia J.C.

Fluorescence signals were classified according to whether they showed green, red, or yellow fluorescence, the latter being indicative of colocalization of the red and green fluorescence signals. Images were obtained using an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Analysis and quantification of the colocalization signal were evaluated under equal magnification, laser intensity, and saturation in the same preparations using Zeiss colocalization software. For each staining condition, 10 optical fields were observed, and representative images from two separate experiments are shown in the figures. For electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy, we used a previously published method without modifications (20Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D.

Expression Vector Cloning and Transfection of the MART1 and Pmel17 Genes—The MART1 vector was a gift from Dr. Toshihiko Hoashi (Tokyo, Japan). DNA oligonucleotides for gp100 PCR were synthesized and purified by Operon. The forward primer is 5′-GGG ATG GAT CTG GTG CTA AAA AGA TGC CTT CTT C-3′, and the reverse primers are 5′-CAC CAG CCT TAA GGT GGC TGT ACC ATC CAG-3′ and 5′-GAC CTG CTG CCC ACT GAG GAG GGG GCT ATT-3′. These primers were used to construct expression vectors for the full-length gp100 cDNA (pcDNA5/Pmel17fl-V5) and its truncated form (pcDNA5/Pmel17Δ-V5) that contains the N-terminal 468 amino acids. The DNA fragments were amplified from a gp100-containing plasmid (clone IOH4070 open reading frame; Invitrogen) by 35 cycles of PCR as described previously (27Chen K.G. Szakacs G. Annereau J.P. Rouzaud F. Liang X.-J. Valencia J.C. Nanigeni C.N. Hooks J.J. Hearing V.J. Gottesman M.M. Pigm. Cell Res. 2005; 18: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The PCR fragments were subcloned into the pcDNA5/FRT-V5-His6 vector (Invitrogen) confirmed by NheI and BamHI digestion and by DNA sequencing (the DNA Sequencing Facility, NCI, Bethesda). The plasmids were prepared using a Qiagen plasmid extraction kit. Transient transfection of full-length Pmel17 (FL-Pmel17), cleaved N-terminal fragment (cNTF-Pmel17), and a mock FRT control vector all dual tagged with V5 and His into MNT-1 cells, CHO, Lec2, and Lec8 cells was achieved by employing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or by electroporation using the Nucleofector kits and equipment (AMAXA, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting and Sample Preparation—For immunoblotting, cell extracts or isolated fractions were prepared as published previously (20Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H.

Briefly, cell extracts were mixed with sample buffer (2×) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were then separated on 10, 8-16,% or 4-20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with casein for 1 h at 23 °C and were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing with T-PBS (1× PBS, 1% Tween 20, pH 7.2), blots were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 23°C. Primary antibodies were detected using the ECL plus system (Amersham Biosciences), according to the supplier's instructions. Sialyltransferase Assays—Assays were performed as described previously (28Giordanengo V. Bannwarth S. Laffont C. Van Miegem V. Harduin-Lepers A. Delannoy P. Lefebvre J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme activity was measured at 37 °C for 4 h in 50 μl of reaction mixture comprising 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 6.2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.2% Triton CF-54, 50 μm CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac (1.85 kBq) (Amersham Biosciences), with 23 μl of the enzyme source and 1 mg·ml-1 of fetuin, asialofetuin, orosomucoid, asialo-orosomucoid, bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM), or asialo-BSM (Sigma) as acceptor substrates. The reactions were stopped by addition of 1 ml of H2O. Proteins were precipitated in 1 ml of 5% phosphotungstic acid in 2 n HCl and filtered on GF/A glass microfiber filters (Whatman). The radio-active material present on each filter was counted by liquid scintillation. The rate of this reaction was linear with time at least for 8 h. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Quantitative Real Time PCRs—Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the supplier's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using 200 ng of cytoplasmic RNA as reported previously (14Valencia J.C. Watabe H. Chi A. Rouzaud F. Chen K.G. Vieira W.D. Takahashi K. Yamaguchi Y. Berens W. Nagashima K. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1080-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All amplified products were sequence-verified. Quantitative real time PCRs were performed using the Opticon analysis system (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA) and a hot-start PCR that contained the double-stranded specific DNA-binding dye SYBR Green I (Sigma). The following primers and their product sizes were used: β-actin, 5′-CCCTCCATCGTCCACCGCAAATGCTTC and 3′-GACTGCTGTCACCTTCACCGTTCCAG, 204 bp; ST3Gal I, 5′-TTCCTCACCTCCTTCTTCCTGAACTAC and 3′-TCTTCTCCAGCATAGGGTCCACATTCC, 346 bp; and ST6GalNAc II, 5′-GGAAATGTCGGTGGAGTGTTCAGCAAG and 3′-AAGCAACTAACCCCCATCAAGTGCCAGACCCTC, 356 bp. After 5 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles were performed as follows: 15 s denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s annealing at 60 °C, 30 s extension at 72 °C, and fluorescence detection at 78 °C. A melting curve fluorescence analysis was performed on each sample once the amplification cycles were completed to verify that a single product had been amplified. The Ct is defined as the point when the amplification starts the exponential phase (29Rouzaud F. Annereau J.P. Valencia J.C. Costin G.E. Hearing V.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2154-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The fold difference was calculated by subtracting the Ct of the test sample from the Ct of actin to give ΔCt, and then fold difference = 2-ΔCt. Reagents and Enzymes—Cells were treated with the following reagents (all from Calbiochem): 10 μm 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid overnight (30Azuma Y. Taniguchi A. Matsumoto K. Glycoconj.

N-Glycan chains were analyzed by digestion with EndoH or PNGaseF according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Modifications to glycans were analyzed with α-2,3,6,8,9-neuraminidase, endo-α-N-acetyl-galactosaminidase (O-glycanase), β1,4-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Calbiochem), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enzyme digestion with EndoH (New England Biolabs) for 35S-labeled samples was performed as described previously (20Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D.

Briefly, Pmel17 samples were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads with denaturing buffer after heating for 5 min at 100 °C. Labeled samples were digested in reaction buffer with 500 units of EndoH for 18 h at 37 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE, and further analyzed by autoradiography. Metabolic Labeling—Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (20Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M.

Cells were preincubated in methionine-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C and were then labeled for 30 min with 0.5 mCi of [35S]Met/Cys (Redivue Pro Mix; Amersham Biosciences) and chased in methionine-plus medium for the times indicated in the text. After harvesting, cells were washed and incubated in lysis buffer overnight (33Costin G.E. Valencia J.C. Wakamatsu K. Ito S. Solano F. Milac A.L. Vieira W.D. Yamaguchi Y. Rouzaud F. Petrescu A.J.

Samples were pre-cleared with normal rabbit serum and protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C.The supernatants were collected and immunoprecipitated with either αPEP13h or αPEP25h for 2 h at 4°C, and immunocomplexes were then separated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C. For double immunoprecipitation, we recovered these supernatants and immunoprecipitated them again with either αPEP13h or αPEP25h for 2 h at 4 °C and then recovered the immunocomplexes again with protein-G beads and continued with the protocol. After washing, the final pellets were suspended in SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) with 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and separated on 10 or 8-16% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). Control samples were immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum and were processed in parallel. Lectin Staining—Lectin blot analysis using digoxigenin-labeled lectins (Roche Applied Science) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Melanin Content Assay—Melanin content was determined as described previously (34Virador V. Kobayashi N. Matsunaga J. Hearing V.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In brief, cell pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of 1 n NaOH, and melanin concentrations were quantitated by absorbance at 405 nm using a standard curve generated from synthetic melanin (Sigma). For each condition, the melanin content is expressed as nanograms of melanin divided by total protein concentration in micrograms. Values are then reported as a percentage of those obtained in controls. Each experiment was repeated at least two times. αPEP25h Specifically Detects iPmel17—The antibody αPEP25h was designed against residues 393-414 (Fig. 1A) in the core region of Pmel17 (35Kim K.K.

Here we show that ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (NPP2) is N-glycosylated on Asn-53, Asn-410, and Asn-524. Mutagenesis and deglycosylation experiments revealed that only the glycosylation of Asn-524 is essential for the expression of the catalytic and motility-stimulating activities of NPP2. The N-glycan on Asn-524 was identified as Man8/9GlcNAc2, which is rarely present on mature eukaryotic glycoproteins. Additional studies show that this Asn-524-linked glycan is not accessible to α-1,2-mannosidase, suggesting that its non-reducing termini are buried inside the folded protein. Consistent with a structural role for the Asn-524-linked glycan, only the mutation of Asn-524 augmented the sensitivity of NPP2 to proteolysis and increased its mobility during Blue Native PAGE.

Autotaxin, also known as NPP2, is an enzyme of ∼125 kDa that is secreted by various cell types in vertebrates (1Moolenaar W.H. van Meeteren L.A. Giepmans B.N. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 2Stefan C. Jansen S. Bollen M. Trends Biochem.

It belongs to the seven-member family of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatases/phosphodiesterases (NPPs). 5The abbreviations used are: NPP, nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 5The abbreviations used are: NPP, nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Whereas some NPPs (NPP1, NPP3) preferentially hydrolyze nucleotides, others (NPP2, NPP6, NPP7) favor lipid phosphodiesters as substrates. NPP2 functions as the major extracellular lysophospholipase-D. Its only firmly established physiological substrate is lysophosphatidylcholine, which is cleaved into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and choline. LPA is an important signaling molecule that promotes the proliferation, survival, and motility of cells mainly via the G-protein-coupled receptors LPA1 and LPA2 and is likely to mediate most, if not all, of the biological effects of NPP2 in health and disease (1Moolenaar W.H. van Meeteren L.A.

NPP2 has also been linked to tumor metastasis because its expression is increased in several cancers, including breast cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, and Hodgkin lymphoma, and the invasiveness of the tumor cells correlates with the circulating concentration of NPP2 (8Yang S.Y. Lee J. Park C.G. Kim S. Hong S. Chung H.C. Min S.K. Han J.W. Lee H.W. Lee H.Y. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2002; 19: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Baumforth K.R.N. Flavell J.R.

Finally, NPP2 may play a role in the etiology of multiple sclerosis, possibly because it modulates the interaction of oligodendrocytes with their extracellular matrix, thereby initiating myelination (11Fox M.A. Colello R.J.

All these NPP isozymes have a catalytic domain that is N-terminal-flanked by two somatomedin-B-like domains and C-terminal by a nuclease-like domain, but the exact function of these non-catalytic domains is not yet known (2Stefan C.

J. 2003; 371: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). NPP2 is a secreted protein that is synthesized as a pre-proenzyme, whereas NPP1 and NPP3 are largely transmembrane ectoenzymes. The activity of NPP2 is moderately increased by removal of the propeptide by furin-like proteases (15Jansen S. Stefan C. Creemers J.W.M. Waelkens E. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3081-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Koike S. Keino-Masu K. Ohto T. Masu M. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). NPP1 and NPP2 are both regulated through product inhibition by AMP and lysophosphatidic acid, respectively (17van Meeteren L.A. Ruurs P. Christodoulou E. Goding J.W. Takakusa H. Kikuchi K. Perrakis A. Nagano T. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21155-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is also known that NPPs, including NPP2 (18Stracke M.L. Årestad A. Levine M. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. Melanoma Res. 1995; 5: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), are glycoproteins but the nature and functions of these glycosylations have not been studied yet in detail, except for NPP7 where an enzymatic deglycosylation was found to be associated with a loss of enzymatic activity (19Wu J. Hansen G.H. Nilsson Å. Duan R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that NPP5 contains a high mannose-type glycan, but the exact structure and function of this glycan has not been analyzed (20Ohe Y. Ohnishi H. Okazawa H. Tomizawa K. Kobayashi H. Okawa K. Matozaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have mapped the glycosylation sites of NPP2 and demonstrate that the glycan chain of Asn-524, which was identified as Man8/9GlcNAc2, has a structural function and is essential for the expression of enzymatic activities by NPP2. NPP2 Constructs—Wild-type NPP2 (NPP2-WT) was obtained by cloning rat NPP2 (Protein Data Bank accession number AAH81747) in the EGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) tag at the C terminus was replaced by a c-Myc tag, and a hemagglutinin (HA) tag was introduced at the N terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative glycosylation sites of HA-NPP2-Myc was performed using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the primer sets used is available upon request. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture—HEK293T, A2058 melanoma cells, and NIH-3T3 cells were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, glucose (4.5 g/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were transiently transfected at 30–40% confluency using linear polyethylenimine of 25 kDa (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). The medium was collected 72 h post-transfection and cleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min. The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation (30 min at 100,000 × g) was used as “cell lysate.” Aliquots of the cell lysates and medium were used for immunoblot analysis and the assay of NPP2-associated activities. NPP2-Myc mutants were purified from the conditioned medium of HEK293T cells that were kept in medium that only contained 5% fetal bovine serum. 72 h after transfection the medium was collected and cleared by centrifugation (15 min at 1000 × g), and the NPP2-Myc fusions were purified by affinity chromatography on anti-c-Myc that was covalently bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose (15Jansen S. Stefan C. Creemers J.W.M. Waelkens E. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3081-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Assay of NPP2 Activities—Lysophospholipase-D activities were measured by incubating aliquots of medium, cell lysates, or purified NPP2-Myc fusions with 2 mm (final) of the substrate lysophosphatidylcholine (14:0) at 37 °C in a total volume of 40 μl. Subsequently, the released choline was quantified spectrophotometrically at 540 nm after incubation for 5 min with 50 μl of the peroxidase reagent (50 mm Tris at pH 9.0, 2 mm N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfoproryl)-3-methylaniline, 5 units/ml peroxidase, and 0.01% (V:V) of Triton X-100) and of the choline oxidase reagent (50 mm Tris at pH 9.0, 2 mm aminoantipyrine, 5 units/ml choline oxidase, and 0.01% Triton X-100) (21Cimpean A. Stefan C. Gijsbers R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities were determined from the release of p-nitrophenolate from p-nitrophenyl thymidine 5′-monophosphate (21Cimpean A. Stefan C. Gijsbers R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were incubated at 37 °C with 5 mm substrate, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris/HCl at pH 9.0 in a total volume of 35 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 3% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. Subsequently, the mixture was neutralized with NaOH and p-nitrophenolate was quantified colorimetrically at 405 nm. The assay of the lysophospholipase-D and nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities of NPP2 after pretreatment with N-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H (Figs. 1 and 5), and the corresponding controls (NPP2 with heat-inactivated enzymes), was done in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm ZnCl2 to counteract inhibition of NPP2 by EDTA that was present in the glycosidase preparations. The cell motility-stimulating activities of affinity-purified NPP2 mutants were studied using a 48-well Boyden chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe). Cells were harvested using a trypsin/EDTA solution, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) bovine serum albumin (Gentaur), and left for recovery for 1 h at 37 °C. Meanwhile, the bottom wells were filled with varying concentrations of the NPP2-Myc fusions diluted in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10 μm lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC C14:0) and 0.05% (v/v) bovine serum albumin (Gentaur). The upper and lower chambers were separated by a polyvinyl-pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membrane (8-μm pore; Neuroprobe) coated with 0.02% fibronectin (Sigma). Subsequently, 5·104 cells were loaded into each upper well. After incubation of the assembled chambers for 240 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator, the non-migrated cells in the upper compartments were removed and the cells that had migrated through the membrane were stained with the “Diff-Quik” procedure (Medion Diagnostics, Düdingen) and counted under the light microscope at ×200 (medium power field). For each condition, five randomly chosen fields were counted. The basal migration of the NIH-3T3 cells was determined in the absence of NPP2 and subtracted from the number of cells that migrated in response to NPP2.FIGURE 5Inactivation of NPP2 by incubation with glycosidases. A, affinity-purified NPP2-m1,2,3,5 was treated with N-glycosidase F, endoglycosidase H, or α-1,2-mannosidase under non-denaturing conditions. The figure shows the effects of these treatments on the mobility of NPP2-m1,2,3,5 during SDS-PAGE (immunoblot) and on its lysophospholipase-D and nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities (bar diagram).

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 3–8% Tricine gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and subjected to 60 V for 2 h in 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, and 10% methanol (pH 8.6). After blotting, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Serva) and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Following overnight incubation with anti-Myc (clone 9E10) monoclonal antibodies, the Myc-tagged fusion proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako) and enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer). Blue Native PAGE was performed according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (22Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 66.7 mm 6-aminocaproic acid and 50 mm Bis-tris at pH 7.0 was run for 30 min at 80 V. Subsequently, the electrophoresis was continued at 200 V until the tracking line of Coomassie Blue G-250 reached the edge of the gel. As cathode buffer 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm Bis-tris, and 0.02% Coomassie Blue G-250 (pH 7.0) was used. The anode buffer contained 50 mm Bis-tris at pH 7.0. Medium samples were loaded in Blue Native sample buffer containing 25 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm Bis-tris, and 5% glycerol at pH 7.0. Immunoblotting was performed as described above, except that 0.01% SDS was added to the blotting buffer. Purification and Enzymatic Treatments of Melanoma NPP2 and NPP2 Fusions—The conditioned medium of HEK293T cells was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin) and incubated overnight with anti-c-Myc-Sepharose at 4 °C. After washing of the beads with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m NaCl, the retained proteins were eluted with 100 mm triethanolamine at pH 12.0. N-linked glycans were removed by overnight incubation of 30 μl of the NPP2 fusions or melanoma NPP2 at 37 °C with 50 milliunits of N-glycosidase F (10 units/ml; Roche Applied Science), 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.3 mm phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, and 1.3 mm benzamidine, either in the absence (non-denaturing) or presence (denaturing) of 0.1% (v/v) SDS and 50 mm mercaptoethanol. For deglycosylation with α-1,2-mannosidase (23Maras M. Callewaert N. Piens K. Claeyssens M. Martinet W. Dewaele S. Contreras H. Dewerte I. Penttila M. Contreras R. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 77: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or endoglycosidase H (5 units/ml; Roche Applied Science), the NPP2 fusions or melanoma NPP2 were incubated overnight with 10 milliunits of the glycosidase in the presence of 20 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.5. For trypsinolysis, affinity-purified NPP2 fusions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with the indicated concentrations of trypsin. The treatment was stopped by boiling the samples for 5 min in the presence of 100 mm Tris, 4% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, 8% (w/v) SDS, 24% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) Serva blue. Subsequently, the NPP2 fusions were visualized by immunoblotting. Reverse Transcription PCR—RNA was isolated from NIH-3T3 cells using the Mammalian Total RNA extraction kit (Sigma). Following reverse transcription with the M-MulV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas), the cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers for the LPA1/Edg-2 receptor with TTTCACAGCCCCCAGTTCA and CATTCTCATAGTCCTCTGGCGA being the forward and the reverse primer, respectively, and for the LPA2/Edg-4 receptor with TGGCCTACCTCTTCCTCATGTTCC and ATTGACCAGTGAGTTGGCCT as sense and antisense primer, respectively. The PCR product was separated on an agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Actin was used as a positive control. The specificity of the PCR reactions was evaluated by parallel incubations in the absence of reverse transcription polymerase. Sequencing of the Glycan Chains—Determination of the glycan chains at position 524 was performed as described by Laroy et al. (24Laroy W. Contreras R. Callewaert N. Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of affinity-purified NPP2-m1,2,3,5 was denatured by incubation for 1 h at 50 °C with 50 μl of a buffer containing 8 m urea, 360 mm Tris at pH 8.6 and 3.2 mm EDTA. Subsequently, the protein was bound to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane of a Multiscreen-IP plate (Millipore, Bedford, CA) by a gentle vacuum. Next, the bound protein was reduced and iodoalkylated, followed by the release of the glycan chains by addition of 1.25 IUBMB (International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) milliunit of N-glycosidase F in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, for 3 h at 37 °C. The glycan mixture was evaporated to dryness and a 1:1 mixture of 20 mm 8-amino-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 1.2 m citric acid and 1 m NaCNBH3 in dimethyl sulfoxide was added. The derivatization was allowed for 18 h at 37 °C. After this, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 μl of deionized water. Excess 8-amino-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid was removed using a bed of Sephadex G10 packed in a Multiscreen filter plate (Millipore). After sample application, the resin beds were eluted three times by addition of 10 μl of water and centrifugation for 10 s at 750 × g. The eluate was evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 5 μl of deionized water. 0.4-μl aliquots of the cleaned-up derivatized glycans were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 2 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, in the presence of Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (2 units/ml; Roche Applied Science), jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, Diplococcus pneumoniae β-1–4-galactosidase (1 unit/ml; Roche Applied Science), jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (30 units/ml; Glyko), bovine epididymis α-fucosidase (0.5 units/ml; Glyko), almond fucosidase (3 milliunits/ml; Glyko), and recombinant Trichoderma reesei α-1,2-mannosidase, as indicated (23Maras M. Callewaert N. Piens K. Claeyssens M. Martinet W. Dewaele S. Contreras H. Dewerte I. Penttila M. Contreras R. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 77: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Unit definitions are as specified by the enzyme suppliers. The native as well as the digested glycan chains were analyzed using an Applied Biosystems 377A DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer). Modeling—The macromolecular model (Fig. 7A) was built with DeepView 3.7SP5 (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9561) Google Scholar). Mapping of the Glycosylation Sites of NPP2—Stracke et al. (26Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Unsworth E.J. Årestad A. Cioce V. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2524-2529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that NPP2 binds to concanavalin A, which is initial evidence that it is an N-glycosylated protein. Consistent with this notion, we found that the deglycosylation of Myc-tagged rat NPP2 (Fig. 1A) or human teratocarcinoma NPP2 (not shown) with N-glycosidase F increased their mobility during SDS-PAGE. The same mobility shift was detected when the N-glycosidase F treatment was performed under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 1A), enabling us to examine the effect of deglycosylation on the enzymatic activity of NPP2. Both the lysophospholipase-D activity and the nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity of rat (Fig. 1B) and human NPP2 (not shown) were largely abolished by deglycosylation. The remaining activity could be sedimented with concanavalin A-Sepharose (not illustrated), suggesting that it stemmed from incomplete deglycosylation. The above data indicated that the N-glycosylation of NPP2 is essential for the expression of its catalytic activity. The program NetGlyc (www.Cbs.dtu.dk/services/) predicts that rat NPP2 contains five potential N-glycosylation sites, namely Asn-53, Asn-398, Asn-410, Asn-524, and Asn-806, further denoted as sites 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively (Fig. 2A). These residues are the first of the motif NXS/T, where X can be any residue and the last residue can be either Ser or Thr. Of the predicted glycosylation sites, all but site 2 are conserved in human and mouse NPP2 (not illustrated). To examine which of the predicted glycosylation sites of rat NPP2 were actually glycosylated, we first mutated each of the corresponding asparagines individually into an alanine and examined the effects of these mutations on the mobility of NPP2 during SDS-PAGE and on its enzymatic activities (Fig. 2B). An increased mobility during SDS-PAGE was only noted following the mutation of sites 1, 3, and 4, indicating that these are the only true glycosylation sites. Moreover, only the mutation of site 4 abolished the nucleotide and lysophospholipid phosphodiesterase activities of NPP2, showing that the glycosylation of Asn-524 is required for the expression of catalytic activity. Next, we used the reverse mutational approach and mutated either all or all but one of the five predicted N-glycosylation sites. Compared with the mobility of NPP2 with all five sites mutated, a decreased mobility during SDS-PAGE was only noted when sites 1, 3, or 4 were mutated to an Asn (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the previous conclusion that these are the only N-glycosylated residues. Furthermore, of the latter mutants only the one with an intact site 4 was catalytically active (Fig. 2B), confirming that only the glycosylation of this site is required for the expression of catalytic activity. It is also worth noting that the mutation of site 4 caused an accumulation of NPP2 in the cells (Fig. 2C), amounting to 160 ± 3% (n = 3) of the level of NPP2-WT, suggesting that the glycosylation of Asn-524 also contributes to the maturation and/or trafficking of NPP2. However, this represents a relatively minor effect because the accumulation of NPP2 in the culture medium, which contains more than 95% of the total pool of NPP2, was at most marginally (86 ± 24% of the level of NPP2-WT; n = 3) affected by mutation of site 4, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C). A combination of the mutation of site 4 with that of three other sites also resulted in an increased cellular retention of NPP2, except for NPP2-m1,2,3,4, which, however, also accumulated somewhat less in the medium, indicating that it represents a mutant that is less well expressed (Fig. 2C). Next, we examined whether the N-glycosylation of NPP2 is required for its cell motility-stimulating capability. Because the latter activity of NPP2 is mainly mediated by the LPA1 receptor, and to a lesser extent by the LPA2 receptor (5Hama K. Aoki J. Fukaya M. Kishi Y. Sakai T. Suzuki R. Ohta H. Yamori T. Watanabe M. Chun J. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17634-17639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we first identified cells that express these LPA receptors. Consistent with a report by Fischer et al. (27Fischer D.J. Nusser N. Viraq T. Yokoyama K. Wang D. Baker D.L. Bautista D. Parrill A.L. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 776-784PubMed Google Scholar), we found by reverse transcription PCR that NIH-3T3 fibroblasts express both the LPA1 and LPA2 receptor (not illustrated), making these cells suitable for our motility studies. Subsequently, we have used affinity-purified NPP2 (mutants) as chemoattractants for NIH-3T3 cells in Boyden chambers (Fig. 3, A and B). Although NPP2-WT, NPP2-N53A, and NPP2-N410A were equally efficient chemoattractants, NPP2 with sites 1–5 mutated (NPP2-(m1–5)) and NPP2-N524A did not measurably stimulate cell motility, demonstrating that the N-glycosylation of Asn-524 is essential for NPP2 to act as a chemoattractant. Asn-524 of NPP2 Contains an Oligomannosidic Side Chain—To examine the structure of the essential glycan side chain of site 4, we used affinity-purified NPP2-m1,2,3,5, which is only glycosylated on Asn-524 (site 4). After an incubation of this NPP2 mutant with N-glycosidase F, the released glycans were labeled fluorescently and analyzed by DNA sequencing equipment (24Laroy W. Contreras R. Callewaert N. Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that the native glycans had the structures Man8GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 (Fig. 4A, panel 2), which were also detected in the reference protein RNase B (panel 10). Additional glycan structures were released by the N-glycosidase F treatment of the NPP2-m1,2,3,5 preparations, but these could be shown to be derived from the monoclonal antibodies that were used for purification and are minor contaminants of the NPP2 preparation, and sialylated glycans on contaminating proteins deriving from the culture medium (panel 11 and not shown). The identity of the Asn-524-linked glycan as Man8GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 was confirmed by the sensitivity of these glycans to digestion by α-1,2-mannosidase (panel 4). As a final line of evidence for the presence of an oligomannosidic side chain on Asn-524, Fig. 5A shows that treatment of affinity-purified NPP2-m1,2,3,5 from the conditioned medium of HEK293T cells with the hybrid/high mannose-specific endoglycosidase H or with N-glycosidase F resulted in an increased mobility during SDS-PAGE and a highly deficient catalytic activity. Again, the remaining activity could be sedimented by incubation with concanavalin A-Sepharose (not shown), indicating that this activity was derived from incompletely deglycosylated NPP2. To rule out the possibility that the essential side chain is an artifact resulting from the transient overexpression of NPP2, the N-glycosidase F treatment was repeated with the conditioned medium of NPP2-secreting A2058 melanoma cells (18Stracke M.L. Årestad A. Levine M. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. Melanoma Res. 1995; 5: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both the nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity and the lysophospholipase-D activity were nearly completely abolished after enzymatic deglycosylation (Fig. 5B), and the remaining activity was retained by concanavalin A-Sepharose (not shown). The Asn-524-linked Glycan Chain Is a Structural Determinant of NPP2—Oligomannosidic glycans are usually transiently present on glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum before they get further processed in the Golgi to complex or hybrid-type glycans (28Roth J. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 285-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The presence of an oligomannosidic side chain in a mature mammalian glycoprotein indicates that this chain might contribute to the structure of the protein by forming non-covalent contacts with surrounding residues. As a result, this side chain may no longer be accessible for the processing enzymes in the Golgi. That this applies to the glycan chain on Asn-524 of NPP2 was initially suggested by the observation that treatment of NPP2-m1,2,3,5 with α-1,2-mannosidase affected neither the mobility during SDS-PAGE nor the catalytic activity of this mutant (Fig. 5A), indicating that the oligomannose side chain on Asn-524 is not accessible to this glycosidase. The same results were obtained for melanoma NPP2 (Fig. 5B). In further agreement with the notion that the glycan chain on Asn-524 is a structural determinant, we found that NPP2-N524A was degraded by trypsin concentrations that were ∼10 times lower than those needed for the degradation of wild-type NPP2 (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, an increased sensitivity to trypsin was not seen when the other N-glycosylation sites of NPP2 were mutated, as in NPP2-m1,2,3,5, indicating that these sites do not contribute to the structure of NPP2. We also noted that the mutation of site 4 (Asn-524), unlike the mutation of sites 1, 2, 3, and/or 5, resulted in an increased mobility of NPP2 during Blue Native PAGE (Fig. 6B). Because this mobility is determined by the extent of binding of the negatively charged Coomassie Blue stain (22Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar), which is affected by the surface to volume ratio of the protein, these results suggest that NPP2-N524A has a less compact structure than the wild-type protein, accounting for the better binding of Coomassie Blue and the increased electrophoretic mobility. Conservation of Asn-524 in Other NPPs—Recently, the structure has been determined of a bacterial NPP that displays ∼30% sequence identity with the catalytic domain of the human NPPs (29Zalatan J.G. Fenn T.D. Brunger A.T. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9788-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Using this structure (Protein Data Bank accession 2GSU) as a template, we have generated a model of the catalytic domain of NPP2 (Fig. 7A). This model shows that Asn-524 is remote from the catalytic site and that the bulky Asn-524-linked glycan is unlikely to interact directly with the catalytic site. However, it cannot be excluded that the Asn-524-linked glycan affects the conformation and accessibility of the catalytic site. Finally, we have examined whether Asn-524 is phylogenetically conserved. Asn-524 was conserved in NPP2 from all examined vertebrates (Fig. 7B). Moreover, this glycosylation site was conserved in NPP1–6 but not in NPP7 (Fig. 7C), indicating that it may represent an essential N-glycosylation site in six of seven known NPP isozymes. Glycosylation of NPP2 on Asn-524 Is Functionally Important—Glycosylation is an important post-translational modification that can affect the intracellular trafficking, stability, and/or function of glycoproteins. We show here that NPP2 is N-glycosylated on three sites, two of which were mapped to the catalytic domain (Figs. 1 and 2). Of these, only the glycosylation of Asn-524 appears to contribute to some extent to the trafficking of NPP2 (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the routing of NPP3 (30Meerson N.R. Bello V. Delauney J. Slimane T.A. Delautier D. Lenoir C. Trugnan G. Maurice M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4193-4202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NPP7 (19Wu J. Hansen G.H. Nilsson Å. Duan R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to the plasma membrane also appears to be controlled by N-glycosylation. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the Asn-524-linked glycan of NPP2 is also required for the expression of its lysophospholipase-D as well as for its nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities (Fig. 2B). Because the lysophospholipase-D activity of NPP2 mediates most, if not all, of its biological functions, it comes as no surprise that the Asn-524 glycan was also required for the cell motility-stimulating activity of NPP2 (Fig. 3). It is important to note that mature NPP2 (Fig. 1A) and NPP2-m1,2,3,5 (Fig. 5A) are also inactivated by enzymatic N-deglycosylation, indicating that the Asn-524-linked glycan is required to maintain NPP2 in an active conformation. These data do not rule out, however, that this glycan chain also contributes to the folding of NPP2 during maturation. NPP7 is also inactivated by deglycosylation or mutagenesis of N-glycosylation sites (19Wu J. Hansen G.H. Nilsson Å. Duan R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the activity of NPP7 is regulated by multiple N-glycosylation sites and none of these corresponds to Asn-524 of NPP2. Our results are at variance with an earlier study that did not find an effect of pretreatment of NPP2 with N-glycosidase F on its motility-stimulating activity (18Stracke M.L. Årestad A. Levine M. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. Melanoma Res. 1995; 5: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, no dose-response curves were done in the latter study, and it is therefore possible that effects of N-deglycosylation were missed because the motility-stimulating effects were measured at supersaturating concentrations. Structure and Function of the Asn-524-linked Glycan—We have identified the Asn-524-linked glycan chain by classical sequence analysis, before and after treatment with a host of glycosidases, as Man8/9GlcNAc2 by exoglycosidase array sequencing (Fig. 4). Interestingly, NPP5 from brain membranes is retained by the mannose-specific Galanthus nivalis lectin, suggesting that it may also contain an oligomannosidic glycan chain (20Ohe Y. Ohnishi H. Okazawa H. Tomizawa K. Kobayashi H. Okawa K. Matozaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). High mannose glycan chains are relatively rare in mature eukaryotic proteins because they are usually processed in the Golgi to complex or hybrid glycan chains (28Roth J. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 285-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there are some proteins known to contain this type of “immature” glycan chain, including the neural adhesion molecule L1 (31Horstkorte R. Schachner M. Magyar J.P. Vorherr T. Schmitz B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1409-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a neural glycoprotein (32Clark R.A.C. Gurd J.W. Bissoon N. Tricaud N. Molnar E. Zamze S.E. Dwek R.A. McIlhinney R.A.J. Wing D.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the β-subunit of rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase (33Tyagarajan K. Lipniunas P.H. Townsend R.R. Forte J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10200-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The presence of some Man8/9GlcNAc2, but not smaller high mannose glycans, in mature NPP2 is suggestive for partial trimming by the endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I without further processing by the Golgi mannosidases (33Tyagarajan K. Lipniunas P.H. Townsend R.R. Forte J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10200-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We suggest that the Asn-524-linked glycan of NPP2 does not undergo additional processing in the Golgi because it is no longer accessible, probably because it is a structural determinant of NPP2 and becomes (partially) buried during the folding of NPP2. Consistent with this view we find that this glycan is accessible for hydrolysis by N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H but not by α-1,2-mannosidase (Fig. 5A), indicating that the non-reducing termini of the glycan are shielded. It is intriguing that Asn-524 is mapped to the hinge region between the catalytic and nuclease-like domains (Fig. 2A). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the Asn-524-linked glycan stabilizes the interaction between these two domains, which may be essential for the expression of catalytic activity. In accordance with this interpretation we found that NPP2 showed an increased sensitivity to trypsinolysis following the mutation of Asn-524 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the mutation of sites 1, 2, 3, and 5 did not have such an effect, suggesting that the N-glycans of NPP2 do not merely sterically protect trypsinsusceptible sites. Likewise, only the mutation of Asn-524 increased the mobility of NPP2 in Blue Native PAGE, indicating that this mutant is less structured and can bind more Coomassie Blue. In conclusion, we have shown here that the catalytic activity of NPP2 is critically dependent on the presence of a Man8/9GlcNAc2 moiety on Asn-524, a site that is phylogenetically conserved, not only in NPP2 but also in six of seven NPP isozymes. We suggest that this glycan chain has a structural function and is involved in the interaction between the catalytic and nuclease-like domains of NPP2.

The interaction between TSG-6 and HA is pH-dependent, with a marked reduction in affinity on increasing the pH from 6.0 to 8.0. Here we have investigated the mechanism underlying this pH dependence using a combined approach of site-directed mutagenesis, NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry and microtiter plate assays. Analysis of single-site mutants of the TSG-6 Link module indicated that the loss in affinity above pH 6.0 is mediated by the change in ionization state of a histidine residue (His4) that is not within the HA-binding site. To understand this in molecular terms, the pH-dependent folding profile and the pKa values of charged residues within the Link module were determined using NMR. These data indicated that His4 makes a salt bridge to one side-chain oxygen atom of a buried aspartate residue (Asp89), whereas the other oxygen is simultaneously hydrogen-bonded to a key HA-binding residue (Tyr12). This molecular network transmits the change in ionization state of His4 to the HA-binding site, which explains the loss of affinity at high pH. In contrast, simulations of the pH affinity curves indicate that another histidine residue, His45, is largely responsible for the gain in affinity for HA between pH 3.5 and 6.0. The pH-dependent interaction of TSG-6 with HA (and other ligands) provides a means of differentially regulating the functional activity of this protein in different tissue microenvironments.

HA is a ubiquitous high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan (up to 107 Da) composed entirely of a repeating disaccharide of d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc). It is found in the ECM of most vertebrate tissues and displays diverse biological functions, including roles in embryonic development, cell migration, and ovulation, as well as being implicated in many disease processes (30Tammi M.I. Day A.J. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 31Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M.I. J. Biol.

Although free HA is present in synovial fluid and the vitreous of the eye, in other tissues (e.g. cartilage, skin, brain) it is found mainly in complex with proteins, forming vital structural components of the ECM. The wide range of functions ascribed to HA is thought to arise mainly through interactions with HA-binding proteins that lead to the formation of protein-HA complexes with distinct architectures and functional activities (12Day A.J. de la Motte C.A. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 33Day A.J. Sheehan J.K. Curr. Opin. Struct.

As such, the production of TSG-6 at sites of inflammation is expected to result in modulation of these architectures and has clear importance for ECM biology and inflammatory disease processes (3Milner C.M. Higman V.A. Day A.J. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2006; 34: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Day A.J. de la Motte C.A. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this regard, changes in the affinity of TSG-6 for HA (and other ECM molecules) by alterations in tissue microenvironments could have a crucial role in the regulation of TSG-6 function. We have previously reported that the interaction of HA with Link_TSG6 is pH-dependent, having maximal affinity at pH 5.5-6.0 and a significant loss of function with either increasing or decreasing pH (see Fig. 1A) (22Parkar A.A. Kahmann J.D. Howat S.L. Bayliss M.T. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, the pH dependences of both Link protein and the G1 domain of aggrecan (two constitutively expressed HA-binding proteins) for HA have no drop in affinity between pH 6.0 and 8.0 (22Parkar A.A. Kahmann J.D. Howat S.L. Bayliss M.T. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, the pH dependence of the HA-Link_TSG6 interaction has been questioned (35Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with suggestions that the earlier observation results from an artifact of the solid-phase assays used (i.e. where either the protein or HA was immobilized on the surface of the microtiter plate). Here we present isothermal titration calorimetry data for defined oligosaccharides of HA (i.e. where both the protein and HA are in the solution phase) that confirms the original observation. We have determined the solution structure of Link_TSG6 in the absence and presence of an HA octasaccharide (HA8AN) (28Blundell C.D. Mahoney D.J. Almond A. DeAngelis P.L. Kahmann J.D. Teriete P.

Biochem. 2006; 353: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, it should now be possible to come to a molecular understanding of the pH dependence of HA binding. To produce a curve with a rise and then fall in activity as seen in Fig. 1A, two pH-dependent factors are required. Previously it was proposed that the gain in activity up to pH 6.0 was due to the pH-dependent folding of Link_TSG6, which was observed (by a qualitative method) to fold mostly over the range of pH 4.5 to 6.0 (22Parkar A.A. Kahmann J.D. Howat S.L. Bayliss M.T. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since Link_TSG6 showed no unfolding or gross perturbation to the structure between pH 6.0 and 7.5, it was concluded that a change in ionization state of one (or more) charged residues was likely to be responsible for the loss of activity above pH 6.0 (36Blundell C.D. Kahmann J.D. Perczel. A. Mahoney D.J. Cordell M.R. Teriete P. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Kennedy J.F. Phillips G.O. Williams P.A. Hascall V.C. Hyaluronan. Vol. 1.

In this study, we have demonstrated, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) that the previously reported decrease in affinity for HA between pH 6.0 and 7.5 (22Parkar A.A. Kahmann J.D.

Analysis of single-site mutants of the TSG-6 Link module (Link_TSG6) indicated that the loss in affinity above pH 6.0 is mediated by the change in ionization state of a particular histidine residue (His4). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) experiments allowed the pH-dependent folding profile of the protein and the pKa values of all relevant residues within Link_TSG6 to be determined. Combining these functional and NMR data, we show how the change in charge state of His4 is relayed to HA-binding residues via a network involving a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond, thus providing novel insights into the molecular basis of this important pH-dependent interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2134704080,"The collapsing glomerulopathy of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is characterized by podocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation. In affected glomeruli, proliferating podocytes adhere in aggregates to form glomerular pseudocrescents and fill an enlarged Bowman's space. Previously, we reported that sidekick-1 (sdk-1), an adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, was highly up-regulated in HIV-1 transgenic podocytes. In the current work, we explore how sdk-1 overexpression contributes to HIVAN pathogenesis. Murine podocytes infected with HIV-1 virus expressed significantly more sdk-1 than control-infected cells. Podocytes stably transfected with an sdk-1 expression construct grew in large aggregates with a simplified morphology characterized by a disorganized actin cytoskeleton, changes similar to podocytes in HIVAN. In contrast to controls, HIV-1 infected podocytes adhered to stably transfected sdk-1 podocyte aggregates in mixing studies. Furthermore, substrate-released cell sheets of wild-type podocytes were readily dissociated by mechanical stress, whereas HIV-1 podocytes remained in aggregates. The number of HIV-1 podocyte aggregates was significantly reduced in cells expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct specific for sdk-1 compared with cells expressing control shRNA. Finally, in a HIVAN mouse model, sdk-1 protein was detected in podocytes in collapsed glomerular tufts and in glomerular pseudocrescents. These findings suggest that sdk-1 is an important mediator of cellular adhesion in HIV-infected podocytes and may contribute to podocyte clustering that is characteristic of pseudocrescent formation in HIVAN."

Occupying an important receptor-proximal position in the signaling cascade, FAK mediates signal transduction in response to adhesion and/or binding of growth factors. The ability of FAK to transduce downstream signal(s) is dependent on its phosphorylation at tyrosine residues (3Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Activation and phosphorylation of FAK leads to recruitment of a number of SH2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins that mediate signaling via multiple downstream pathways. These include the Src family kinases (4Xing Z. Chen H.C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Guan J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p130CAS (5Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7015-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Six tyrosine phosphoacceptor sites have been identified in FAK, Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr-577, Tyr861, and Tyr925, most of which appear to play positive regulatory roles. As an example of FAK signaling, when integrin is activated, FAK is recruited to focal contacts and autophosphorylated at Tyr397 (8Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.A. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7079-7090PubMed Google Scholar). This creates a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of Src family tyrosine kinases and the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, allowing their recruitment and activation. The recruitment of Src leads to additional phosphorylation on Tyr576, Tyr577, and Tyr925. Phosphorylation at Tyr576 and Tyr577 further activates FAK kinase activity (9Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), whereas that at Tyr925 creates a binding site for the protein complex containing the adaptor Grb2 and the ras guanosine 5′-triphosphate exchange factor mSOS, which in turn activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Phosphorylation at Tyr861 is less well understood but has been detected in several cell lines, including prostate carcinoma cells (10Slack J.K. Adams R.B. Rovin J.D. Bissonette E.A. Stoker C.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12735-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Leu and Maa (14Leu T.H. Maa M.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6992-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggested that phosphorylation at Tyr861 might enhance Tyr397 phosphorylation of Tyr397, and our group recently reported that Tyr861 phosphorylation was crucial for H-ras-induced transformation (15Lim Y. Han I. Jeon J. Park H. Bahk Y.Y. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29060-29065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), implying that Tyr861 phosphorylation is likely to potentiate the functions of FAK. In contrast to the other phosphotyrosine residues, phosphorylation at Tyr407 has not been extensively studied. Src has been proposed to regulate phosphorylation of FAK Tyr407, because phosphorylation of Tyr407 was significantly and adhesion-dependently elevated in the presence of c-Src (16Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Src kinase-independent phosphorylation at Tyr407 has been also proposed, based on increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK Tyr407 in a colon cancer cell line (KM12C) expressing kinase-deficient Src proteins (17Brunton V.G. Avizienyte E. Fincham V.J. Serrels B. Metcalf C.A. Sawyer T.K. Frame M.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although it is well known that other tyrosine phosphorylation events are linked to FAK activation and downstream signal transduction, the function of FAK phosphorylation at Tyr407 remains unknown. A recent study showed that exposure of endothelial cells to vascular endothelial growth factor induced Tyr407 phosphorylation, suggesting that Tyr407 phosphorylation may play a role in transducing the vascular endothelial growth factor signals, which trigger assembly of focal adhesions and endothelial cell migration (18Le Boeuf F. Houle F. Huot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39175-39185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is highly possible that phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr407 plays one or more roles in FAK functions. Here we show for the first time that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation appears to function in the negative regulation of FAK activity and function. Cell Culture—NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged FAK Y407F were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS, 250 μg/ml G418, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Reagents and Antibodies—Chloroquine (CQ), deferoxamine, trichostatin A, propidium iodide, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), and poly(Glu-Tyr) were purchased from Sigma, and monoclonal antibody against HA (12CA5) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Polyclonal antibodies against p21 and p27, and monoclonal antibodies against ERK2 (K-23), phospho-specific ERK (E-4), and PI3K were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-Tyr(P) antibody (4G10) and the anti-Src antibody (GD11) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The monoclonal antibody against FAK and polyclonal antibodies to a phosphorylation site specific against FAK[Tyr(P)397] and FAK[Tyr(P)407] were purchased from BioSource Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Morgan Hill, CA). Construction of Mutant FAK Mammalian Expression Vectors— The full-length cDNA encoding FAK was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The synthetic oligonucleotides GGA AGA CAC ATT TAC CAT GCC CTC G (Tyr407 → Phe) and GGA AGA CAC AGA AAC CAT GCC CTC G (Tyr407 → Glu) were used to change Tyr407 to phenylalanine or glutamic acid. The cDNAs encoding wild-type FAK and mutant Y407F and Y407E were inserted into pRC/cytomegalovirus at the NotI/XbaI cloning sites to generate inframe fusions with a 3′ sequence encoding three HA epitopes (YPYDVPDYA). Molecular Constructs—PCR amplification was used to generate recombinant GST-407 constructs encoding a portion of the FAK protein sequence including the phosphorylation site at tyrosine 397–407, with and without mutations at Tyr407 (407Y (wild-type amino acids 385–411), 407F (amino acids 385–411, Tyr407 → Phe), and 407E (amino acids 385–411, Tyr407 → Glu)). The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). Transfection—Transient transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. In brief, NIH3T3 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown to ∼80% confluence for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with a mixture of 15 μl of Lipofectamine and 4 μg of plasmid DNA. After 5 h, the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with medium containing 10% FBS. For stable transfections, transfected cell populations were selected by the continuous presence of 250 μg/ml of G418. Synthesis and Transfection of siRNA Constructs—To design oligonucleotides targeting the mouse FAK mRNA for degradation, siRNA Design of Ambion was used. The chosen targeted FAK siRNA sequence (5′-AATGCCCTAGAGAAGAAGTCC-3′) was chemically synthesized by Ambion (Austin, TX), and the negative control siRNAs were purchased from Ambion. In vitro cotransfections were performed with 500 nm of mouse siRNAs and 4 μg of constructs encoding chicken FAK with and without introduced mutations (407Y, 407F, and 407E), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was measured by a colorimetric assay using MTT. In brief, NIH3T3 cells transfected with each of the generated plasmids were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA and seeded into 35-mm dishes at 1 × 105 cells/dish. After the cells were allowed to attach, the medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT was added to each plate in a volume of 100 μl, and the cells were incubated for 1 h. The medium was then removed, 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added, and the plates were incubated for half an hour at room temperature. The mean concentration of absorbance at 570 nm in each set of all samples was measured using a 96-well microtiter plate reader (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA). BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—The cells were pulsed with 10 μm BrdUrd for 2 h, harvested, fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 30 min, and resuspended in 2 n HCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. After the reactions were neutralized with 0.1 m sodium tetraborate for 2 min, the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody in 0.5 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were then washed once and incubated in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min prior to analysis with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and the CellQuest™ software. Cell Adhesion Assays—Fibronectin was diluted to 10 μg/ml in serum-free medium (SFM) and dispensed to 12-well plates (10 μg/ml) that were incubated at room temperature for at least 1 h to allow adsorption. The plates were then washed with PBS, blocked with 0.2% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and then washed with SFM (2 × 10 min). Cultured cells were detached from culture plates with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA, suspended in SFM containing 0.25 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and centrifuged. The cells were then resuspended in SFM, plated onto fibronectin-coated plates, and incubated for the indicated durations at 37 °C. For analysis of cell morphology, the cells were visualized with an inverted microscope (Zeiss) at 20× magnification. Migration Assay—Fibronectin (10 μg/ml) was added to each well of a 24-well Transwell plate (8-μm pore size; Costar), and the membranes were allowed to dry for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells transfected with the various constructs (5 × 104 cells) were added to the upper compartment of each well, and the plate was incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Nonmigrated cells on the upper membrane were removed with a cotton swab. Migrated cells (located on the lower surface of the filters) were fixed for 5 min in methanol, stained with 0.6% hematoxylin and 0.5% eosin, and then counted. Subcellular Fractionation—After washing twice with PBS (500 μl/10-cm diameter plate), 150 μl of hypotonic solution (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were applied to the culture plates. The cells were subsequently scraped off the plates and homogenized on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant represented the cytosolic fraction. The membrane fraction was collected by solubilizing the remaining pellet in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoblotting—The cells were washed twice with PBS and were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, denatured with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies, detected with species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Kinase Assays—FAK immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once with 10 mm Tris buffer. The pellets were dissolved in 20 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100), and the reactions were started by adding 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm cold ATP, and purified either GST-FAK on glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns or with 1 mg/ml poly(Glu-Tyr) as a substrate, and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer and then analyzed in SDS-PAGE gel. FAK Tyr407 Phosphorylation Appears to Be Inversely Correlated with Cell Proliferation—To investigate the role of phosphorylation at FAK residue Tyr407, we examined this site-specific phosphorylation under various cell conditions (Fig. 1). FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation was found to be higher in NIH3T3 cells treated with the cell cycle arresting agents, CQ and deferoxamine (Fig. 1A), as well as in serum-starved cells (Fig. 1B) and cells grown to achieve higher density saturation at confluence versus exponentially growing cells (Fig. 1C). Because both cell proliferation and FAK activity are decreased under conditions of serum starvation, contact inhibition, and cell cycle arrest, these results seem to suggest that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation might decrease the ability of FAK to regulate cell proliferation. Consistent with this notion, we found that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation was inversely related with activation-associated phosphorylation at FAK Tyr397 (Fig. 1). To further investigate the potential negative role of FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation in cell proliferation, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace Tyr407 with a nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine residue (407F) and transfected vectors encoding HA-tagged 407F into NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2). Compared with vector-transfected cells, those expressing wild type (FAK) and FRNK showed similar cell numbers. In contrast, for 72 h mutant FAK 407F-transfected cells showed slight but significant increased in cell numbers versus those expressing wild-type FAK (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this increased proliferation, ERK phosphorylation, which is involved in cell cycle progression (19Zhao J. Pestell R. Guan J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4066-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Zhao J.H. Reiske H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) was increased (Fig. 2B), and BrdUrd incorporation into newly synthesized DNA in response to serum stimulation was 1.4-fold higher (Fig. 2C) in FAK 407F-transfected cells versus wild-type FAK-transfected cells. In NIH3T3 cells, the G1 population peaked between 6 and 10 h following activation of serum, and the population of cells in S phase began to increase 12 h after serum starvation (data not shown). We then examined the effect of expression of 407F mutant FAK. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged FAK 407F showed significantly more cell proliferation. Western blot analysis of HA-FAK 407F expression levels in individual clones (Fig. 3A, top left panel) reveal that NIH3T3 cells expressing higher levels of FAK 407F showed correspondingly higher proliferation rate (Fig. 3A, bottom left panel) and higher overall tyrosine phosphorylation levels in total cell lysates (Fig. 3A, right panel). Similarly, cell counting and BrdUrd incorporation revealed that NIH3T3 cells stably overexpressing FAK 407F showed delayed cell cycle arrest in response to serum starvation (Fig. 3B) and CQ treatment (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the duration of delay paralleled the expression level of FAK 407F. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation might be involved in negative regulation of cell proliferation.FIGURE 3NIH3T3 cells stably overexpressing FAK 407F shows delayed cell cycle arrest. A, NIH3T3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged Y407F mutant FAK were lysed, and expression levels were evaluated by both anti-HA and anti-FAK immunoblotting. ERK2 was used as a loading control (top panel). The cells were collected at the indicated time points, and the cell numbers were evaluated with cell counting via trypan blue exclusion (bottom panel). The cells were lysed, and phosphotyrosine (pY) immunoprecipitates (IP) were immunoblotted (IB) with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody (right panel). B, attached cells were starved, collected at the indicated times, and either counted (top panel) or measured newly synthesized DNA by flow cytometry (bottom panel). C, cells were treated with CQ for the indicated times and counted with a hemocytometer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FAK Tyr407 Phosphorylation Negatively Regulates Autophosphorylation and Kinase Activity—Our finding that the phosphorylation levels of Tyr407 and Tyr397 were inversely correlated promptly us to investigate whether FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation might negatively regulate FAK activity. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the empty vector, wild-type FAK (407Y), nonphosphorylatable mutant FAK (407F), or phosphorylation-mimicking mutant FAK (407E). Interestingly, both total tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and autophosphorylation at Tyr397 was increased in cells transfected with FAK 407F and decreased in cells transfected with FAK 407E, compared with cells expressing wild-type FAK (Fig. 4A, top panel). Similarly, in vitro kinase assay showed that FAK kinase activity was increased in cells expressing FAK 407F and decreased in cells expressing FAK 407E, compared with cells expressing wild-type FAK, FAK 407Y (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Phosphorylation of FAK Tyr397 creates a high affinity binding site for PI3K and the Src family kinases. Consistent to the altered levels of Tyr397 phosphorylation, interactions of FAK with PI3K and Src were decreased in cells transfected with FAK 407E mutant and increased in cells transfected with FAK 407F mutant versus those expressing wild-type FAK (Fig. 4B). These results collectively suggest that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation may inhibit FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation. Because Tyr397 and Tyr407 are located close to one another in the linker region of the FAK protein, we examined whether phosphorylation of one affects that of the other. We generated a recombinant GST-FAK 407 polypeptide containing phosphorylatable Tyr397 and wild-type Tyr407 (407Y) or mutants containing either Glu (407E) or Phe (407F). FAK immunocomplexes containing these peptides were used for in vitro kinase assays. Interestingly, Tyr397 phosphorylation was 2-fold higher in experiments containing GST-FAK 407F and decreased in those containing GST-FAK 407E, compared with assays involving GST-FAK 407Y (Fig. 4C). These findings seem to indicate that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation might inhibit the access of additional phosphates on Tyr397, perhaps because of increased negative charge repulsion. It has been known that FAK molecules phosphorylated at Tyr397 reside close to the plasma membrane (21Katz B.Z. Romer L. Miyamoto S. Volberg T. Matsumoto K. Cukierman E. Geiger B. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29115-29120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Hamadi A. Bouali M. Dontenwill M. Stoeckel H. Takeda K. Ronde P. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4415-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the absence of Tyr397 phosphorylation decreases its residency at focal adhesions but not in cytosol (22Hamadi A. Bouali M. Dontenwill M. Stoeckel H. Takeda K. Ronde P. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4415-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, higher levels of Tyr407 phosphorylation were observed in cytosolic FAK versus membrane-bound FAK (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these data suggest that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation negatively regulates autophosphorylation at Tyr397 and FAK kinase activity. FAK Tyr407 Phosphorylation Negatively Regulates FAK Functions—Because FAK plays a critical role in integrin-mediated signal transduction, where it acts as a cytosolic kinase to phosphorylating cytoskeletal proteins, and because integrin-mediated signal transduction requires Tyr397 phosphorylation (23Hanks S.K. Ryzhova L. Shin N.Y. Brabek J. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: 982-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation might negatively regulate FAK function. To examine this possibility, we designed a unique 21-bp small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequence targeted against the mouse FAK (mFAK) mRNA and used this siRNA to knock down mFAK expression in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5A). Expectedly, NIH3T3 cells transfected with mFAK siRNA showed decreased expression of FAK (Fig. 5A, compare first and second lanes) as well as decreased cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin (data not shown, but refer to Figs. 6A and 7). To further investigate the role of phosphorylation at FAK residue Tyr407, we then re-expressed recombinant HA-tagged chicken FAK (cFAK) in the knockdown NIH3T3 cells and compared the knockdown cells with those expressing recombinant wild-type or mutant FAK proteins. Consistent with the results reported above, FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation was increased in knockdown cells transfected with cFAK 407F and decreased in those expressing cFAK 407E, as compared with the knockdown cells transfected with cFAK 407Y (data not shown but refer to Fig. 6B). Similarly, proliferation and BrdUrd incorporation were increased in knockdown cells expressing cFAK 407F and decreased in those expressing cFAK 407E, as compared with the knockdown cells transfected with cFAK 407Y (Fig. 5, B and C). We then examined integrin-mediated cell adhesion in FAK knockdown cells and those re-expressing mutant or wild-type cFAK. The cells were detached and replated on fibronectin and observed for spreading. By 60 min about 38% of the mFAK knockdown NIH3T3 cells showed cell spreading on fibronectin. In contrast, about 82% of cells re-expressing wild-type cFAK completed cell spreading. Interestingly, re-expression of cFAK 407F further enhanced adhesion and spreading, whereas re-expression of cFAK 407E decreased adhesion and spreading, as compared with those re-expressing wild-type cFAK (Fig. 6A). During spreading on fibronectin, FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation was increased in cells re-expressing cFAK 407F and decreased in cells re-expressing cFAK 407E, as compared with those re-expressing wild-type cFAK (Fig. 6B), indicating the involvement of FAK activation in this process. Because FAK plays a key role in the regulation of cell migration (1Guan J.L. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 23Hanks S.K. Ryzhova L. Shin N.Y. Brabek J. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: 982-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we further investigated adhesion-mediated cell migration in FAK knockdown cells and those re-expressing mutant or wild-type cFAK. The experiments in Transwell chambers revealed that re-expression of wild-type cFAK enhanced cell migration of mFAK knockdown NIH3T3 cells. Consistently, FAK-mediated cell migration was further increased in cells re-expressing cFAK 407F and decreased in cells re-expressing cFAK 407E, as compared with those re-expressing wild-type cFAK (Fig. 7), indicating that FAK-mediated cell migration was inhibited by re-expression of cFAK in a Tyr407 phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation negatively regulates FAK functions during adhesion-dependent signal transductions.FIGURE 6FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation negatively regulates integrin-mediated cell adhesion. A, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 500 nm of siRNA targeting mFAK alone or with 4 μg of the indicated cFAK mutant constructs. Detached cells were plated on fibronectin (FN)-coated plates for the indicated time periods. The cells on the plates were photographed by phase contrast microscopy with a digital camera (top panel), and spreading cells were counted (bottom panel).

Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether Src family kinase plays a role in FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation during cell cycle arrest. NIH3T3 cell lysates were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and GST-FAK407 as a substrate to allow phosphorylation, and phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by autoradiography (Fig. 8). Interestingly, GST-FAK407 phosphorylation was observed only in CQ-treated cell lysate (Fig. 8A, left panels), and it was also seen in the presence of PP1, the Src family kinase inhibitors (Fig. 8A, right panels). In addition, consistent to the previous report (13Lim Y. Han I. Kwon H.J. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12735-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), trichostatin A caused an increase of FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation in H-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells even in the presence of PP1. Therefore, it seems that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation is not mediated by Src family kinase during cell cycle arrest. Although phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr407 was previously reported (16Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Brunton V.G. Avizienyte E. Fincham V.J. Serrels B. Metcalf C.A. Sawyer T.K. Frame M.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the function of this event was virtually unknown until this point. Here, we provided the first evidence that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation has a negative regulatory function. Unlike the other five phosphorylatable tyrosine residues, which showed increased phosphorylation upon activation of FAK, higher levels of FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation were observed under conditions of basal FAK activity and relatively low levels of FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation. Both Tyr397 autophosphorylation and FAK kinase activity were decreased in cells transfected with the phosphorylation-mimicking FAK 407E mutant and increased in cells transfected with the nonphosphorylatable FAK 407F mutant (Fig. 4). In addition, FAK functions such as cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and proliferation were decreased in cells transfected with FAK 407E and increased in cells transfected with FAK 407F, as compared with cells transfected with FAK 407Y (Figs. 6 and 7). Collectively, these findings suggest that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation negatively regulates the enzymatic and biological activities of FAK. Protein tyrosine kinases such as FAK play crucial roles in signal transduction, but their constitutive activation often leads to cancer formation and progression (24Busse D. Yakes F.M. Lenferink A.E. Arteaga C.L. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 47-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Ilic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems reasonable to surmise that normal cells have regulatory mechanism(s) responsible for maintaining FAK activity at basal levels. In addition, the cells might also have a second level of negative regulation responsible for abruptly terminating FAK activity when necessary. Negative regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation is seen in another cytosolic tyrosine kinase, Src, which is inactivated by specific C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation by C-terminal Src kinase. Upon phosphorylation, the C-terminal Src phosphotyrosine residue engages in intramolecular interactions that lock the Src molecule in an inactive conformation. Thus, Src can undergo both an activating autophosphorylation event at Tyr416 and an inhibiting phosphorylation event at Tyr527. However, unlike the fairly well elucidated negative regulation of Src, that of FAK has not been extensively studied. A recent paper proposed that the FERM domain, located in the N-terminal region of FAK, might repress the catalytic activity by intramolecular inhibition (26Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 27Jacamo R.O. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, FAK lacking a region of the N terminus corresponding to amino acids 1–384 showed a striking increase in phosphorylation while retaining intact integrin-mediated signaling (27Jacamo R.O. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on these and other reports, it has been proposed that the cytoplasmic domains of integrins activate FAK by relieving FERM-mediated autoinhibition. Here, we provide the first evidence supporting a Tyr407 phosphorylation-mediated negative regulatory mechanism for FAK. Specifically, we show that FAK-407 phosphorylation negatively regulates important FAK functions including cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in NIH3T3 cells (Figs. 6 and 7). This negative regulation could exist in addition to FERM-mediated inhibition, or it could be a downstream event initiated by FERM. Our experiments further revealed that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation appears to inhibit the activating phosphorylation of Tyr397. This may be mediated by physical hindrance of the interaction between ATP and Tyr397, i.e. phosphorylation at Tyr407 creates an electrostatic environment that restricts access to Tyr397, leading to reduced phosphorylation at Tyr397. Consistent with this notion, we showed that the degree of in vitro phosphorylation at Tyr397 of GST-FAK 407Y was higher than that of nonphosphorylatable mutant GST-FAK 407E but lower than that of phosphorylation-mimicking mutant GST-FAK 407E (Fig. 4). Another possibility is that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation may be involved in FERM-mediated autoinhibition of FAK. If the FERM domain represses the catalytic activity of the enzyme by intramolecular autoinhibition, the linker domain of FAK, which contains Tyr407, might participate by stabilizing interactions between FERM and kinase domains. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that FERM contains a phosphotyrosine binding-like domain. Future work will be required to determine the precise mechanism(s) by which inactivating phosphorylation at Tyr407 inhibits activating phosphorylation at Tyr397. In addition, Src has been proposed to regulate FAK phosphorylation at Tyr407 (16Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found, however, that the recombinant FAK polypeptide containing Tyr407 was not phosphorylated by Src family kinase but phosphorylated by cell lysate from serum-starved NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 8), implying negative regulation through FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation by another cytosolic tyrosine kinase. In sum, we herein show for the first time that FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation contributes to negative regulation of kinase activity and decreased autophosphorylation at Tyr397, leading to negative regulation of FAK-related functions in adhesion-mediated signal transduction. We are currently attempting to identify tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphatase that respectively phosphorylate and dephosphorylate FAK Tyr407, in an effort to clarify the precise negative regulatory mechanism(s) of FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation. However, the present work provides the first evidence for negative regulation of FAK activity and function by phosphorylation at Tyr407."
https://openalex.org/W1976326118,"The transcription factor cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB, Creb1) plays a critical role in regulating gene expression in response to activation of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway, which is implicated in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Using the Cre-loxP system, we generated mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation of CREB and studied in this model whether CREB is critical for cardiac function. CREB-deficient mice were viable and displayed neither changes in cardiac morphology nor alterations of basal or isoproterenol-stimulated left ventricular function in vivo or of important cardiac regulatory proteins. Since CREB was proposed as a negative regulator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by enhancing the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, we analyzed the fragmentation of DNA, the activity of caspases 3/7 and the expression of Bcl-2 and did not observe any differences between CREB-deficient and CREB-normal hearts. Our results suggest that the presence of CREB is not critical for normal cardiac function in mice."

DNA double strand breaks in these numbers result in breakage of the D. radiodurans genome into hundreds of short DNA fragments. However, the genome is repaired accurately before initiation of the next cycle of cell division. Albeit D. radiodurans was discovered 50 years ago (6Anderson A.W. Nordon H.C. Cain R.F. Parish G. Duggan D. Food Technol. 1956; 10: 575-578Google Scholar), the underlying mechanisms of its strategies to survive the depicted threats are still only sparsely understood. One of the striking features of D. radiodurans is its intracellular accumulation of Mn(II) in cases of irradiation (7Daly M.J. Gaidamakova E.K. Matrosova V.Y. Vasilenko A. Zhai M. Venkateswaran A.

Interestingly, the level of irradiation protection decreased with lower Mn(II) concentrations. However, the level of DNA double strand breaks seem to be unaffected by the Mn(II) concentration. Thus other mechanisms rather than direct double strand protection from irradiation damage have been suggested to be at work (7Daly M.J. Gaidamakova E.K. Matrosova V.Y. Vasilenko A. Zhai M.

DNA polymerases catalyze the entire DNA synthesis in DNA repair, recombination, and replication, and thus are suggested to be involved in genome repair and rearrangement of D. radiodurans (4Cox M.M. Battista J.R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 5Battista J.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the D. radiodurans genome indicates the presence of three DNA polymerases (11Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol.

Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). PolX, a DNA polymerase of the X family, has recently been purified and thoroughly characterized (13Blasius M. Shevelev I. Jolivet E. Sommer S. Hübscher U. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Lecointe F. Shevelev I.V. Bailone A. Sommer S. Hübscher U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was found that PolX is stimulated by Mn(II) and plays an important role in double strand repair in D. radiodurans. Besides its capability to catalyze DNA synthesis PolX harbors a structure-modulated 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activity. The PolA 2The abbreviations used are: PolA, DNA polymerase A; nt, nucleotide(s); ESDSA, extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing. gene was identified and it has been shown that PolA is necessary for DNA damage resistance of D. radiodurans (15Gutman P.D. Fuchs P. Minton K.W. Mut. Res. DNA Repair. 1994; 314: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Gutman P.D. Fuchs P. Ouyang L. Minton K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3581-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, PolA has a 35% sequence identity (49% similarity) with E. coli DNA polymerase I, which might indicate similar functions of both DNA polymerases. Most recently, it was found that D. radiodurans PolA is crucial for the reassembly of DNA fragments into intact circular chromosomes by a process termed extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing involving significant synthesis of new DNA (17Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Due to the vitally important role of PolA in irradiation resistance of D. radiodurans we became interested in this enzyme. For the first time PolA was expressed, purified, and thoroughly characterized. We found that PolA is active in the presence of Mg(II). However, when investigating the DNA polymerases response to DNA damage, it was found that certain DNA lesions that occur through irradiation of DNA block the enzyme. We further found that the enzyme tolerates the presence of Mn(II). Moreover, in the presence of Mn(II) the enzyme is able to catalyze DNA bypass synthesis of the lesions that block the enzyme in the absence of Mn(II). Our results suggest an enzyme modulator function of Mn(II), a role of Mn(II) that was so far not anticipated in the mechanisms that provide D. radiodurans with its high irradiation resistance. Strain—Dried D. radiodurans R1 type strain was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (ATCC number 13939) and cultured as described by the supplier. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—Genomic DNA was isolated and the DNA polymerase domain of D. radiodurans DNA polymerase A (PolA*) amplified by using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with the upstream primer (containing His6 tag): 5′-CGCATCATGCCATGGGCAGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCACAGCAGCGAACGCGAACACGCGCAGACCCCCGAGGAG-3′ and downstream primer, 5′-CGGGAATTCCATATGTCACTTCGTGTCAAACCAGTTCGGCCCCGTCCC-3′ (amino acid 337–956). PolA* was obtained by cloning the gene into the NcoI and NdeI sites of pET15b (Novagene). Constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 Rosetta pLysS cells (Stratagene) and expressed with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.5 for 3 h. Harvested cells were lysed with 2 mm lysozyme (Roth) and His-tagged PolA* was purified by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The eluted PolA* fraction was concentrated via Amicon (molecular mass cut off 50 kDa) and protein concentration was detected with SDS-PAGE by comparison with bovine serum albumin. Primer Extension Assays—A 33-nt template 5′-d(AAATCAACCTATCCTCCTTCAGGACCAACGTAC)-3′ was primed with a 5′-32P-end-labeled 20-nt 5′-d(CGTTGGTCCTGAAGGAGGAT)-3′. The reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 50 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm dNTPs, 150 nm primer-template, and 0 or 1 mm MnCl2. Reactions were initiated by adding PolA* and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. All DNA polymerase concentrations are given in the figure legends. The reactions were terminated with 3 volumes of 80% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Oligonucleotides for investigation of lesion bypass were obtained from Purimex (Grebenstein, Germany). Sequences were: abasic site template, 5′-d(AAATCAaCCTATCCTCCTTCAGGACCAACGTAC)-3′, 23-nt oligonucleotide for standing start conditions, 5′-d(CGTTGGTCCTGAAGGAGGATAGG)-3′; oxoA/oxoG template, 5′-d(AAATOAACCTATCCTCCTTCAGGACCAACGTAC)-3′, and 25-nt oligonucleotide for standing start experiments, 5′-d(CGTTGGTCCTGAAGGAGGATAGGT)-3′. DNA Polymerase Thermostability and Metal Ion Dependence—For testing the thermostability of PolA* primer extension assays were performed as described above. Samples were incubated 10 min with 1 nm PolA* at increasing reaction temperatures ranging from 30 to 60 °C. To test the metal ion dependence of PolA* primer extension was done as described above using the same buffer without divalent metal ion. Metal ions (MgCl2, MnCl2, or a mixture of MgCl2 and MnCl2, respectively) were added to the reaction mixture in concentrations ranging from 10 μm to 20 mm. Reactions were started with 0.5 nm PolA* and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with 3 volumes of 80% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and analyzed by 12% denaturating PAGE. Data were quantified by phosphorimager analysis (Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). Activity was measured by quantifying the intensity of each band. From this quantification the amount of incorporated nucleotides was calculated. The total amount of incorporated nucleotides for each reaction equals the sum of incorporated nucleotide of each band. All reactions were done in triplicates. Steady State Kinetics—DNA substrates were prepared by hybridizing the 5′-32P-end-labeled 20-nt primer to a 33-nt template. Reactions (30 μl) comprised the same buffer as described above and contained 150 nm primer-template complex. Reactions were incubated (with unmodified templates, 1 nm PolA*; with templates containing lesions, 10 nm PolA*) at 30 °C for 10 min and were conducted in the presence of one respective dNTP. At least eight different concentrations were chosen to result in product conversion between 1 and 20% to ensure single completed hit conditions as reported (24Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). All reactions were done in triplicate and terminated with 3 volumes of 80% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and analyzed by 12% denaturating PAGE. Data were quantified by phosphorimager analysis (Molecular Imager FX). The kinetic constants were derived from linear Eadie-Hofstee plots (product formation/dNTP concentration versus dNTP concentration) with linear regression using Microsoft Excel as described (24Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Strand Displacement Assay—A 90-nt template, 5′-d(CCGTCAGCTGTGCCGTCGCGCAGCACGCGCCGCCGTGGACAGAGGACTGCAGAAAATCAACCTATCCTCCTTCAGGACCAACGTACAGAG)-3′, was primed with a 5′-32P-end-labeled 16-nt oligonucleotide 5′-d(CTCTGTACGTTGGTCC)-3′ as primer and an additional 24-nt oligonucleotide, 5′-d(GGATAGGTTGATTTTCTGCAGTCC)-3′ (binding region in the 90-nt template is underlined) to test strand displacement. The reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 50 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm dNTPs, 150 nm primer-template and MnCl2, 0 or 1 mm. Reactions were initiated by adding polA* and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were determined with 3 volumes of 80% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Cloning and Expression—From sequence analysis and comparison with E. coli DNA polymerase I it was suggested that the gene of D. radiodurans PolA (gene ID DR1707) harbors both a 5′ → 3′ exonuclease and a DNA polymerase domain (11Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 12White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). To clone and express the DNA polymerase domain of D. radiodurans PolA (amino acid 337–956) we used genomic DNA that was derived from the D. radiodurans R1 type strain. The restricted polA gene (polA*) was PCR amplified and cloned into an E. coli expression vector containing an N-terminal His6 tag. Protein expression was performed in BL21 Rosetta cells. Purification led to a clean protein fraction containing the anticipated DNA polymerase domain henceforth termed PolA* (Fig. 1A). PolA* Is a DNA-dependent DNA Polymerase—To access whether the cloned protein has indeed DNA polymerase activity we employed primer extension assays comprising a 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide as primer annealed to a 33-nt template. These assay formats have been used numerous times in investigation of DNA polymerase properties such as selectivity and substrate spectra (18Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 52: 429-457Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 19Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The reactions were analyzed by denaturating PAGE and phosphorimaging. We found that PolA* catalyzes proceeding DNA synthesis employing a DNA template in the presence of dNTPs (Fig. 1B). Like all known DNA polymerases, PolA* activity is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions (20Mildvan A.S. Loeb L.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 6: 219-244Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1991Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of Mg(II) no activity was observed (data not shown). Next, we investigated the nucleic acid substrate spectra of PolA*. We found that all combinations such as a DNA-template with rNTPs or an RNA-template with either dNTPs or rNTPs failed to result in any significant nucleotide incorporation (data not shown). Due to its high sequence homology to Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase and the tight relations of the Deinococcae to the Thermus family (1Minton K.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2Battista J.R. Earl A.M. Park M.J.

Microbiol. 1997; 51: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), thermostability of PolA* activity was investigated next. To compare PolA* with the large fragment of T. aquaticus DNA polymerase (Klentaq) and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (22Barnes W.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 23Setlow P. Brutlag D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 224-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we comparatively investigated the thermostability of these enzymes. The respective enzymes were incubated for 15 min at various temperatures. Subsequently their activity was measured in a primer extension assay. It was found that PolA* remains active until about 50 °C, whereas the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I was found to be inactivated already at 40 °C. However, D. radiodurans PolA* is not a thermophilic enzyme because its activity significantly drops at 50 °C (Fig. 1C). As mentioned, an increased Mn(II) concentration is an important factor in the radioresistance of D. radiodurans (7Daly M.J. Gaidamakova E.K. Matrosova V.Y. Vasilenko A. Zhai M. Venkateswaran A. Hess M. Omelchenko M.V. Konstandarithes H.M. Makarova K.S. Wackett L.P. Fredrickson J.K. Ghosal D. Science. 2004; 306: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 8Chou F.I. Tan S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2029-2035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we next investigated the response of PolA* to Mn(II). Reactions were conducted with increasing Mn(II) concentrations (0–10 mm) and keeping Mg(II) constant at 10 mm. We find that up to 1 mm Mn(II) the polymerase activity of PolA* is retained (Fig. 1D). At higher Mn(II) concentrations the activity is decreased and over 7.5 mm totally lost. On the other hand, Mn(II) has no significant effect on the nucleic acid substrate spectrum, no broader tolerance to RNA templates or rNTP incorporation was observed (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that PolA* is a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. PolA* Selectivity—To examine the fidelity of PolA* for Watson-Crick base pair formation we performed primer extension studies. First we investigated single nucleotide incorporation opposite the canonical, as well as opposite the non-canonical, nucleotide in the template strand. A 20-nt primer-33-nt template duplex containing one of the four nucleobases at the position directly after the 3′ terminus was employed for these investigations (Fig. 2). Incorporation was monitored by use of radiolabeled primer in the presence of one of the four dNTPs. We found that the primer was extended efficiently only in cases when nucleobase pairs according to the Waston-Crick rule were formed. To quantify the observed effects we investigated the efficiencies of nucleotide incorporation and mismatch formation under steady-state and single completed hit conditions as described (24Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The data indicates that the selectivity within the investigated sequence context is somewhat sequence dependent and varies between 1:10,000 and 1:100 (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameter of match and mismatch incorporationDNAMn(II)KMkcatEfficiencySelectivityKMkcatEfficiencySelectivitydATPdGTPμm×10-3 min-1×10-3μm×10-3 min-1×10-3A-60.9 ± 8.423 ± 40.40.00026.14 ± 0.324 ± 33.90.0022+15.6 ± 461 ± 83.90.003613.1 ± 1.329 ± 12.20.0021G-101 ± 6.674 ± 60.70.0006120 ± 14.521.3 ± 20.180.0001+0.61 ± 0.0858 ± 7960.0746.9 ± 3.732.5 ± 20.740.0005C-58.9 ± 1565 ± 101.10.00050.01 ± 0.00531.7 ± 423171+0.60 ± 0.0647 ± 4730.0250.01 ± 0.00229.3 ± 120471T-0.04 ± 0.0144 ± 6116717.92 ± 0.522.5 ± 12.80.0024+0.04 ± 0.0146 ± 10114911.58 ± 0.319 ± 1120.01dCTPdTTPA-50.4 ± 1132 ± 70.60.00030.02 ± 0.00127 ± 118051+13.5 ± 1.423 ± 11.70.00160.04 ± 0.0142 ± 310771G-0.03 ± 0.0141 ± 8126511.06 ± 0.158 ± 17.80.0062+0.03 ± 0.0139 ± 7139811.04 ± 0.0751 ± 2490.035C-2700 ± 47143 ± 60.020.00165 ± 9.840 ± 20.30.0001+90.1 ± 1119 ± 10.20.00010.01 ± 0.0039 ± 11140.056T-12.3 ± 233 ± 42.70.00236.38 ± 114 ± 12.20.002+1.09 ± 0.124 ± 2220.0191.69 ± 0.359 ± 2350.031 Open table in a new tab Because it is known that Mn(II) may affect properties of DNA polymerases (25Sirover M.A. Loeb L.A.

Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we next investigated the impact of Mn(II) at 1 mm in the presence of 10 mm Mg(II) on the selectivity of PolA* (Fig. 2C, Table 1). In general, our results indicate that PolA* selectivity is decreased because nucleotide misinsertion efficiency is increased compared with the results obtained in the absence of Mn(II), whereas incorporation efficiency of canonical substrates are affected only to a minor extend. DNA Strand Displacement—Recent investigations suggest the involvement of PolA in extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing (17Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This process involves the ability of the enzyme to displace a DNA strand annealed to the template strand to proceed with DNA synthesis. To access the ability of D. radiodurans PolA* to catalyze strand displacement we set up an assay comprising a radioactively labeled 16-nt primer that is annealed to the complementary site of the 90-nt template (see “Experimental Procedures”). Leaving a short 7-nt gap a second 24-nt oligonucleotide anneals to the complementary template site. This construct was incubated in the presence of all four dNTPs and PolA* in increasing concentrations. If PolA* is devoid of strand displacement activity primer extension should abort after incorporation of seven nucleotides. On the other side, strand displacement activity should allow the enzyme to synthesize longer reaction products. We found that at low enzyme concentrations the enzyme significantly pauses after incorporating seven nucleotides (Fig. 3, lanes 2). However, when increasing the enzyme concentration nearly to equality to the primer-template complex concentration or prolonging the incubation time strand displacement activity was clearly detectable (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar results were obtained in the presence of Mn(II) indicating no significant effect of this metal ion on strand displacement activity. Lesion Bypass Synthesis—Radiation of DNA causes several DNA lesions, such as damage to the nucleobases and sugar backbone (29Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 30Schärer O.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003; 42: 2946-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These lesions have been found to impose severe impediments to the replication machinery if not repaired efficiently (31Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 32Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 33Hübscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To further characterize PolA* the sensitivity of the enzyme to DNA lesions was investigated. For these experiments we used templates containing site-specifically introduced frequently occurring DNA lesions like an abasic site, 8-oxo-adenine (oxoA) and -guanine (oxoG), respectively (29Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 30Schärer O.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003; 42: 2946-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The investigations were performed under “running start” conditions where several undamaged nucleotides in the template have to be replicated before the DNA polymerase encounters the respective damaged site. First we investigated bypass synthesis of an abasic side analogue. In the absence of Mn(II) and in the exclusive presence of Mg(II), PolA* arrests prior to DNA damage (Fig. 4A). Only at increased enzyme concentrations was insertion of a nucleotide opposite the abasic site analogue observed without any significant further extension despite the presence of all four dNTPs. Single nucleotide incorporation studies indicate that dA is predominantly incorporated opposite the lesion (Fig. 5A and Table 2).FIGURE 5Nucleotide incorporation opposite the damaged site. Primer extension assay using template strands containing an abasic site (A), oxoA (B), or oxoG (C) DNA lesion, respectively. Partial primer template sequences are depicted on the top of each set of experiments. Reactions contained either all four dNTPs (X) or dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, as indicated. Reactions were conducted in the absence or presence of 1 mm Mn(II) as indicated.

Open table in a new tab Because it is known for other DNA polymerases that Mn(II) has significant effects on DNA polymerase catalysis the same reactions were conducted in the presence of Mn(II). We found that even at the lowest enzyme concentration used nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion is observed indicating that PolA* is more efficient in processing lesions in the presence of Mn(II). However, further extension is significantly hampered. Single-nucleotide incorporation studies confirm that the efficiency of nucleotide insertion is increased in the presence of Mn(II) in general. Predominantly incorporated opposite to the abasic site is dA and with a 5-fold lower efficiency dG (Table 2). Next we investigated the ability of PolA* to bypass oxoA and oxoG lesions (Fig. 4, B and C). In the absence of Mn(II) nucleotide insertion significantly pauses prior to the lesions at low enzyme concentration and opposite to the lesion when incubated at higher enzyme concentrations. Single nucleotide incorporation experiments indicate that opposite to the oxoA-lesion mainly dT and opposite to the oxoG-lesion mainly dC are incorporated. However, in the presence of Mn(II) at higher enzyme concentrations even synthesis past the lesions is observed (Fig. 5, B and C). Here again addition of Mn(II) increased lesion bypass synthesis significantly. Taken together, the ability of PolA* to deal with DNA template lesions as they occur from radiation of DNA is significantly increased in the presence of Mn(II). PolA has been shown in the past to be an essential enzyme for the extreme radioresistance of D. radiodurans. For instance it was found that a D. radiodurans strain that has mutations in the polA gene loses the ability to polymerize DNA accompanied by a loss of radioresistance (15Gutman P.D. Fuchs P. Minton K.W. Mut. Res. DNA Repair. 1994; 314: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Gutman P.D. Fuchs P. Ouyang L. Minton K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3581-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation of an intact gene from wild-type D. radiodurans to the mutant strain restored both DNA polymerase activity and DNA damage resistance. More recently it was suggested that PolA was involved in a mechanism of D. radiodurans to reassemble hundreds of DNA fragments into intact circular chromosomes (17Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In a PolA-dependent process termed extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing (ESDSA) the enzyme contributes to DNA fragment reassembly. During the progression of ESDSA the enzyme is involved in extensive catalysis of DNA synthesis. Strikingly, an investigated inactive PolA mutant is deficient in ESDSA repair. Taken together, these findings suggest that PolA is heavily involved in DNA synthesis during repair processes that contribute to the reassembly of the scattered genome after irradiation. However, besides damaging the DNA backbone leading to DNA single and double strand breaks, irradiation also affects the integrity of the nucleobases (29Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 30Schärer O.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003; 42: 2946-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Oxidation as a consequence of attack by reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals generated by γ-irradiation, leads to alterations of the nucleobase structure or even loss of the nucleobase. These lesions are mutagenic in other species and mostly block proceeding DNA synthesis by replicative DNA polymerases (31Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 32Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 33Hübscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Thus, these lesions either have to be repaired prior to DNA replication by the DNA repair machinery or being bypassed by DNA polymerases (31Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 32Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 33Hübscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Many species like E. coli comprise several specialized DNA polymerases that are competent in bypassing lesions that block replicative DNA polymerases. These enzymes seem to work in tight coordination with the DNA replication machinery and have been shown to be crucial for the survival of the respective organism. The genome of D. radiodurans has been fully sequenced (11Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 12White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). However, no ortholog lesion-bypass DNA polymerases such as umuC and umuD present in E. coli could be annotated in D. radiodurans by sequence analysis (11Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 12White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains to be elucidated how D. radiodurans DNA polymerases deal with lesions when replicating damaged DNA template strands. We have cloned and expressed for the first time the DNA polymerase domain of D. radiodurans PolA termed PolA*. The protein was thoroughly characterized and it was found that the purified enzyme is indeed a DNA polymerase that does not require accessory factors to be significantly active. As it is found for all known DNA polymerases the DNA polymerase activity of PolA* is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions such as Mg(II) (20Mildvan A.S. Loeb L.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 6: 219-244Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1991Google Scholar). PolA* remains active in the presence of Mn(II) until the concentration of Mn(II) reaches a certain level. Thus, PolA* significantly contrasts D. radiodurans PolX that has DNA synthesis activity exclusively in the presence on Mn(II) (13Blasius M. Shevelev I. Jolivet E. Sommer S. Hübscher U. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Lecointe F. Shevelev I.V. Bailone A. Sommer S. Hübscher U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To address the response of PolA* to DNA damage we investigated the ability of PolA* to bypass some DNA lesions that occur through irradiation. For this purpose DNA template strands were employed that contained site-specifically introduced DNA lesions. It was found that all of the investigated lesions block proceeding DNA synthesis. However, in the presence of Mn(II) the capability of PolA* to bypass lesions was significantly increased. This feature of the enzyme is accompanied by some loss of DNA polymerase selectivity. The influence of Mn(II) ions on the properties of DNA polymerases has been extensively studied before and similar features as the discovered here have been described (25Sirover M.A. Loeb L.A. Science. 1976; 194: 1434-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 26Sirover M.A. Dube D.K. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3323-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it was recently reported that D. radiodurans accumulates very high concentrations of intracellular Mn(II) compared with other radiosensitive bacteria (7Daly M.J. Gaidamakova E.K. Matrosova V.Y. Vasilenko A. Zhai M. Venkateswaran A. Hess M. Omelchenko M.V. Konstandarithes H.M. Makarova K.S. Wackett L.P. Fredrickson J.K. Ghosal D. Science. 2004; 306: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Interestingly, resistance to radiation was found to be a concentration-dependent response to Mn(II). Because D. radiodurans and E. coli exhibit a similar degree of DNA double strand breaks after irradiation with the same dose, it is unlikely that Mn(II) directly protects DNA during irradiation itself (7Daly M.J. Gaidamakova E.K. Matrosova V.Y. Vasilenko A. Zhai M. Venkateswaran A. Hess M. Omelchenko M.V. Konstandarithes H.M. Makarova K.S. Wackett L.P. Fredrickson J.K. Ghosal D. Science. 2004; 306: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Mn(II) participates in the removal of reactive oxygen species that result from irradiation and prevent reactive oxygen species from damaging proteins (7Daly M.J. Gaidamakova E.K. Matrosova V.Y. Vasilenko A. Zhai M. Venkateswaran A. Hess M. Omelchenko M.V. Konstandarithes H.M. Makarova K.S. Wackett L.P. Fredrickson J.K. Ghosal D. Science. 2004; 306: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 8Chou F.I. Tan S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2029-2035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative role of Mn(II) accumulation in the irradiation survival of D. radiodurans was proposed to be its participation in the condensation of its genome (9Levin-Zaidman S. Englander J. Shimoni E. Sharma A.K. Minton K.W. Minsky A. Science. 2003; 299: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10Englander J. Klein E. Brumfeld V. Sharma A.K. Doherty A.J. Minsky A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5873-5977Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on our herein depicted findings it might be that Mn(II) has an additional role in the strategies of D. radiodurans to survive high irradiation doses. We find that Mn(II) renders D. radiodurans PolA* more capable in bypassing DNA template lesions that otherwise block proceeding DNA synthesis. In this sense Mn(II) rather acts as a modulator of enzyme function than being directly engaged in DNA damage prevention or repair processes. These findings are in agreement with the recent finding that D. radiodurans PolX, an enzyme believed to participate in double strand break repair, strongly requires Mn(II) for DNA synthesis activity (13Blasius M. Shevelev I. Jolivet E. Sommer S. Hübscher U. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Lecointe F. Shevelev I.V. Bailone A. Sommer S. Hübscher U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here as we discovered for PolA*, positive effects of Mn(II) on lesion bypass are accompanied by a drop in selectivity. Mismatches formed during DNA synthesis performed in the presence of Mn(II) might be repaired by the D. radiodurans DNA repair system efficiently and thus, should impose less threat to survival of the system as blockage of DNA synthesis by DNA lesions. Our results indicate only a negligible role of Mn(II) on the strand-displacement activity of PolA*. Because the herein depicted results of PolA* are derived from a 5′ → 3′-exonuclease-deficient variant one can only speculate about the impact of Mn(II) on the strand-displacement activity of the full-length PolA enzyme. It remains to be further shown whether the 5′ → 3′-exonuclease activity of PolA plays an essential role on the enzymes function in strand displacement or processing of damaged templates, that DNA polymerase activity is necessary for UV and irradiation resistance is already clearly shown (16Gutman P.D. Fuchs P. Ouyang L. Minton K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3581-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results obtained from studying E. coli (37Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 636-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (38Diaz A. Lacks S.A. Lopez P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggest an important role of the 5′ → 3′-exonuclease activity in PolA for damage response. E. coli PolA activities are compensable during growth in minimal medium, whereas growing on rich media requires at least DNA polymerase or 5′ → 3′-exonuclease activity for cell viability. Whereas for S. pneumoniae the 5′ → 3′-exonuclease activity is not substitutable at all growing conditions, suggesting a lack of a mechanism that could replace this function of PolA. Taken together, the DNA polymerase domain of D. radiodurans PolA was expressed and characterized for the first time. It was found that the derived protein is indeed a DNA polymerase that exhibits Watson-Crick DNA polymerization selectivity. DNA lesions as they occur after radiation seem to be a significant blockage for proceeding DNA synthesis. Mn(II) increases the enzymes ability to bypass lesions, a process that has been shown to be crucial in DNA repair of other bacteria. This finding suggests a role of Mn(II) in D. radiodurans as modulator of enzyme function that might add to the strategies of the bacteria to survive threats such as high doses of radiation or long periods of desiccation."

Polymerase (pol) recognition of primer-templates containing bulge structures and the transmission of a bulge through a polymerase binding site or replication complex are important components of frameshift mutagenesis. In this report, we describe the interaction of the catalytic core of pol η with primer-templates containing bulge structures by single round primer extension. We found that pol η could stabilize a frayed primer terminus, which enhances its ability to extend primer-templates containing bulges. Based on methylphosphonate-DNA mapping, pol η interacts with the single strand template but not appreciably with the template strand of the DNA stem greater than two nucleotides from the primer terminus. These latter characteristics, combined with the ability to stabilize a frayed primer terminus, may explain why primer-templates containing template bulges are extended so efficiently by pol η. Although pol η could accommodate large bulges and continue synthesis without obstruction, bulge structures in the template, but not in the primer, caused termination of the T7 DNA replication complex. Terminations occurred when the template bulge neared the helix-loop-helix domain of the polymerase thumb. Terminations were not observed, however, when bulge structures approached the site of interaction of the DNA with the extended thumb and thioredoxin. At low temperature, however, terminations did occur at this site. DNA misalignment occurs in homopolymer tracts during replication and can lead to frameshift mutations.

Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) or follow incorrect insertion to produce a matched primer-template. This second mechanism could account for larger deletions as well as single nucleotide frameshift deletions in mixed DNA sequences (2Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol.

Polymerase recognition of primer templates containing bulge structures and the transmission of a bulge through a polymerase binding site or replication complex are two important components of frameshift mutagenesis. To better understand the structure-activity relationships in the frameshift mechanism, we investigated both a DNA damage bypass polymerase and a replicative polymerase. For a DNA damage bypass polymerase, we chose the catalytic core of polymerase (pol) 2The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; HLH, helix-loop-helix; dithiothreitol, dithiothreitol; mm, mismatch; mp, methylphosphonate; P/T, primer/template. 2The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; HLH, helix-loop-helix; dithiothreitol, dithiothreitol; mm, mismatch; mp, methylphosphonate; P/T, primer/template. η from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an enzyme that can synthesize past cis, syn-thymidine dimers. For a replicative polymerase, we chose the T7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin replication complex, which is part of the T7 bacteriophage replisome (5Lee J.B. Hite R.K. Hamdan S.M. Xie X.S. Richardson C.C. van Oijen A.M. Nature. 2006; 439: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and is blocked by cis/syn-thymine dimers (6Smith C.A. Baeten J. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21933-21940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These enzymes not only differ in their catalytic properties but also in their overall design for primer-template stem recognition. T7 DNA polymerase is an “A” family polymerase, which includes Escherichia coli DNA pol I, Bacillus DNA pol I, and the Taq pol of Thermus aquaticus (7Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 8Patel P.H. Suzuki M. Adman E. Shinkai A. Loeb L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 823-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the T7 DNA polymerase complexed to processivity factor thioredoxin, a 22-mer primer/26-mer template and a ddNTP, has been solved (9Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The polymerase contains an N-terminal 3′-exonuclease domain and C-terminal polymerase domain. The polymerase domain resembles a right-hand structure with palm, fingers, and thumb sub-domains. The palm contains active site residues, whereas the fingers enclose the dNTP and the templating nucleotide to provide a tight fit characteristic of high fidelity polymerase activities (9Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 10Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A.

This “closed” conformation is induced by dNTP binding and excludes the penultimate nucleotide and the rest of the single strand template from the active site. It is the constrained nature of this closed conformation that effectively excludes a thymine dimer from the active site (13Sun L. Wang M. Kool E.T. Taylor J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14603-14610Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Dutta S. Doublie S. Bdour H.M. Taylor J.S. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3671-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The duplex DNA, which is distant from the active site of T7 DNA polymerase, interacts with the polymerase thumb subdomain, which is composed of helices H and I connected by a peptide strand of 119 residues. A helix-loop-helix motif (HLH, amino acids 339–372) located within this peptide traps the primer-template stem to promote limited processive synthesis and may be drawn closer to the DNA by the interactions of conserved amino acids Asn-335 and Ser-338 (16Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 17Cannistraro V.J. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18288-18295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). E. coli thioredoxin also binds to this same peptide strand containing the HLH and transforms T7 DNA polymerase into a highly processive enzyme (18Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

A recent crystal structure reveals that thioredoxin interaction helps orient positively charged amino acid residues within that peptide strand toward both the primer and template strands (20Brieba L.G. Eichman B.F. Kokoska R.J. Doublie S. Kunkel T.A. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3452-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which may be critical for function. This was verified experimentally by DNA methylphosphonate modifications designed to neutralize polymerase-DNA charge interactions (17Cannistraro V.J. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18288-18295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin interaction makes T7 DNA polymerase synthesis more prone to frameshift deletions and base substitutions, presumably the result of improved processivity (21Kunkel T.A. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6830-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The T7 DNA polymerase 3′-exonuclease activity is required for high fidelity DNA replication. Polymerase and exonuclease sites are separated by 35 Å (9Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), similar to the Klenow fragment (22Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The exonuclease activity of T7 polymerase is fast (kexo > 700 s–1) and about equal to the transfer rate back to the polymerase site to ensure that only a few nucleotides are released per encounter (12Johnson K.A.

Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The thumb and little finger sandwich the DNA and span 8 bp of primer-template. The thumb binds to the minor groove and contacts both primer and template while the little finger fits into the major groove on the opposite side of the DNA. The tether linking the domains wraps around the DNA and may allow the little finger to occupy variable positions relative to the palm. The yeast pol η catalytic core, which we use in this study, is missing 121 C-terminal residues that extend from the polymerase-associated domain (27Trincao J. Johnson R.E. Escalante C.R. Prakash S.

In vivo, the full-length protein interacts with the host replication complex, which targets pol η to the replication fork through an interaction between proliferating cell nuclear antigen (37Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) and residues 621–628 near the 632 C terminus of pol η (38Haracska L.

Here, we describe the interaction of the catalytic core of yeast pol η and T7 DNA polymerase with DNA bulge structures by single round primer extension. Because bulge migration can occur in homopolymer tracts, we have limited this study to intra- or extra-helical bulge structures locked in position by sequence context that have been structurally characterized by NMR analysis (39Morden K.M. Gunn B.M. Maskos K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8835-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40LeBlanc D.A. Morden K.M.

We also utilized methylphosphonate-modified DNA to neutralize polymerase-DNA charge interactions in the template stem and single-strand overhang. The T7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin complex was used as a model system to test primer and template bulge transmission through a replication complex. Proteins and Enzymes—Thioredoxin crystals (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) were dissolved in 50% glycerin with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 5 mg/ml and stored at –20 °C. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs. Calf intestine phosphodiesterase I crystals (Sigma) were dissolved in 50% glycerin and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 4 mg/ml and stored at –20 °C.

Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) exo– T7 DNA polymerase was a double mutant (D5A, E7A) (10Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) fused at the N terminus to the His6 tag containing peptide MGSSHHHHHHSSGLUPRGSH. The gene 5 DNA was cloned into a pET-28a vector (Novagen) through the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (17Cannistraro V.J. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18288-18295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the plasmid was overproduced in cell line BL2(DE)pLysS (Stratagene). The yeast pol η catalytic core containing residues 1–513 of the native protein was used in this study (27Trincao J. Johnson R.E. Escalante C.R. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The polymerase was fused at the N-terminal end to the same His6 tag as described for the T7 DNA polymerase. The plasmid was overproduced in cell line BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). Cell growth, lysis, polymerase purification by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen), and polymerase storage and stability have been described previously (17Cannistraro V.J. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18288-18295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides—Unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from IDT (Coralville, IA). An oligodeoxynucleotide template containing a cis/syn-thymidine dimer was synthesized as described previously (42Hwang H. Taylor J.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4850-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), as well as were oligodeoxynucleotides containing methylphosphonates (17Cannistraro V.J. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18288-18295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Primer-Templates—Primers were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Primer-templates were made by adding 3-fold excess template to the labeled primer before heating and slow cooling. Numbering of nucleotides and phosphates within the primer-template stem begins with the 3′-end of the primer or the complementary position in the template as shown in Scheme 1. Single-Round Synthesis—Reactions were carried out at 23 °C unless stated otherwise in 10 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol with either 5 nm 5′32P-labeled primer-template for the pol η reactions or 0.5 nm for the T7 DNA polymerase reactions. Reactions with the T7 DNA polymerase included 0.5 μm thioredoxin. After 8-min preincubation, 30 μl containing 300 μg of sonicated single-strand calf DNA was added as a trap with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl, and 500 μm dNTPs. All four dNTPs were used in extension reactions opposite mixed sequence DNA, but TTP alone was used opposite homopolymer dA-tracts. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 s before quenching with 80 μl of formamide containing xylene-cyanol dye, 25 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5 μg of cold primer. The trap efficiency was tested with each primer-template by adding the DNA trap to the reaction mix prior to the addition of polymerase. After primer extension, the samples were heated to 100 °C for 8 min before loading 5 μl onto a standard 0.4 mm × 40 cm, 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), and 2.5 mm EDTA. A phosphorimaging screen was exposed to the gel containing the radiolabeled extension products and scanned with a Bio-Rad FX phosphorimaging device. For Kd plots, primer extension was quantified with a Bio-Rad Quantity One program. The fraction extended as a function of polymerase concentration was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation with the Kaleida-Graph program, from which the apparent Kd and the maximum primer extension at saturating enzyme concentration were calculated. Phosphodiesterase I Reactions—Reactions contained 100 nm 5′-32P-end-labeled primer template in 20 μl with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 23 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding enzyme and then terminated after 4 min with 80 μl of formamide containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5 μg of cold primer. Effect of Single Nucleotide Bulge Position on Primer Extension—The goal of this study was to investigate the interaction of pol η and T7 DNA polymerase with primer templates containing bulge structures. Single-round primer extension was used as an assay, because it measures binding of a catalytically competent polymerase with a primer-template. In this assay, the DNA polymerase was pre-equilibrated with the primer-template, after which, dNTPs were added together with excess sonicated single-strand calf thymus DNA as a trap for free polymerase. The primer-templates used are shown in Fig. 1. The primer-template P7/T7, without a thymine dimer photoproduct, was used in preliminary experiments for later comparison with the same sequence containing a thymine dimer. Single nucleotide deletions in the P7 primer were made to create single nucleotide bulges in the template, whereas, single nucleotide additions were made to make bulges in the primer when annealed with template T7. PY/TY and PX/TX were used to test the effect of a single nucleotide bulge between the first and second positions. For pol η, the amount of primer extension was low with a single nucleotide bulge near the primer-template terminus but much higher with a single nucleotide bulge located beyond the third base pair (Table 1). With a bulge located between the third and fourth positions there was 58% primer extension with the bulge in the template and 53% with the bulge in the primer, which were both close to the 64% value observed with the P7/T7 control without any bulge. In contrast, T7 DNA polymerase primer extensions were significantly lower with bulge structures located at these same positions. Primer extensions were also much lower with the primer bulge structures except when located between the fourth and fifth positions.TABLE 1Efficiency of single-round primer extension with a single base bulge located at different positionsP/TDescriptionExtensionpol ηT7 DNA pol%P7/T7No bulge6463PY/TYTemplate bulge between first and second24P7-3/T7Template bulge between second and third1934P7-4/T7Template bulge between third and fourth5837P7-5/T7Template bulge between fourth and fifth6533PX/TXPrimer bulge between first and second61P7+3/T7Primer bulge between second and third1411P7+4/T7Primer bulge between third and fourth5321P7+5/T7Primer bulge between fourth and fifth6149 Open table in a new tab Design of the Primer-Templates—Single-round synthesis with pol η was high enough with the bulge located between the third and fourth primer-template positions to obtain reproducible apparent Kd values (Table 1). Based on the crystal structure of the related Dpo4 complex with DNA (31Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), such a bulge structure would be located within the pol η recognition site for the template-primer stem. Because bulge migration can occur in homopolymer tracts, we used primer-templates with bulge structures known to be either extra- or intrahelical that were locked in position by sequence context. These two types of bulge structures have different structural characteristics, which could have different affects on flanking hybrid stability and polymerase recognition. To test the effect of an extra-helical T bulge structure, we used the primer-template sequence d(GCGAA*AAG)·d(CTTTTCGC) with a T inserted at the position designated by the asterisk in the dA-tract. A single nucleotide T (in boldface) inserted in that sequence context, d(GCGAATAAGCG)·d(CGCTTTTCGC), has been shown to be extra-helical in solution by NMR analysis (39Morden K.M. Gunn B.M. Maskos K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8835-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We eliminated the underlined nucleotides so that the primer-template bulge would close with only a 3-bp stem at the primer terminus. Switching the sequence of the primer and template strands puts the bulge in the template as in d(CGCTTTTC)·d(GAATAAGCG). In addition to a single T, we tested two and three T nucleotide bulges, although there is no structural information available on these structures. To test intra-helical dA bulges, we used the primer-template sequence d(CATCG*GCT)·d(AGCCGATG) with dAs inserted between the two dGs in the sequence as indicated by the asterisk. The dA (in boldface) in the duplex, d(CATCGAGCTAC)· d(GTAACGCGATG), as well as 2 and 3dA bulge structures inserted in the same sequence context have been previously determined to be intra-helical (41Rosen M.A. Live D. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4004-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The underlined sequence was also eliminated to yield a primer-template bulge that would close with a 3-bp stem at the primer terminus. The single-strand portion of the template was a homopolymer dA tract, which cannot base pair with the primer termini, except for d(CATCG*GCT), which terminates with a single 3′T. We found that both pol η and T7 DNA polymerase could bind to the blunt ends of the DNA primer-templates and interfered with extension of the desired bulge-containing primer end when the primer-templates were too short. Primer-templates containing a 20-bp stem were long enough not to cause interference for pol η but not for the T7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin complex, which recognizes ∼20 bp. To circumvent this problem for T7 polymerase, we used when possible a template that formed a stem-loop at one end (6-bp stem with a 6-base loop) designed to block polymerase binding to that end. We also found that excess 6-bp template-stem also serves as a primer-template for pol η, but that this did not interfere with Kd estimations. The Kd for pol η is ∼100 nm, and the primer-template concentration used was 5 nm. Primer templates were made by annealing a 3-fold excess template, which would leave an additional 10 nm template that was unlabeled. The total primer template of both labeled primer template and that contributed by the free unlabeled template was 15 nm, well below the Kd for pol η. Fraying of the Primer-Template Terminus—Based on DNA mfold calculations (43Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9968) Google Scholar), the primer-templates with the 3dN bulge structures should be significantly frayed at 23 °C. This was investigated experimentally with phosphodiesterase I, a single strand-specific 3′-exonuclease. A “frayed” primer-template terminus will be more reactive than a base-paired terminus. The enzyme varies in reactivity with single-strand homopolymers and may also vary with different mixed DNA sequences (44Cannistraro V.J. Kennell D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 170-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For this reason, we compared reactivity of the same P1 primer with different template sequences (Fig. 2). With P1/T1, ∼20% of full-length P1 was degraded in 4 min at 23 °C at the highest enzyme concentration tested (20 μg/ml). In comparison, P1/T1+3T was ∼400-fold more reactive (80% degraded at 0.2 μg/ml) and similar to the single-strand primer P1, and P1/T1 mm with a mismatched primer-template terminus. These data suggest the primer-template terminus in P1/T1+3T is not significantly base paired as predicted by the calculations. Bulge-induced Termination of Synthesis by T7 Polymerase—In vivo, transmission of a bulge structure through the replication complex would occur after pol η primer extension. To study the propagation of defined bulge structures through a replication complex, we used the exonuclease-deficient T7 DNA polymerase together with its processivity factor E. coli thioredoxin. Previously, we reported that a primer-template with a 3T bulge caused T7 DNA polymerase termination. The bulge was located between the third and fourth positions in template strand. Termination occurred after the synthesis of two nucleotides, presumably when the bulge neared the HLH structure in the polymerase thumb domain (17Cannistraro V.J. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18288-18295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This analysis was extended to include site-specific 1, 2, or 3dN extra- or intra-helical bulge structures located in either the template or primer strands of P1/T1, P2/T2, P3/T3, and P4/T4. Some terminations occurred with the single nucleotide bulges, but two- and three-nucleotide template bulges terminated synthesis sharply after addition of only two nucleotides. No termination was detected with these same bulges in the primer strand, but the"
