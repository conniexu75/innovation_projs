https://openalex.org/W1493779021,"A binding protein for plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1-BP) was isolated from human plasma by a four-step procedure. 1) The 7 S globulin fraction of plasma was isolated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. 2) Human endothelial cell-type plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), pretreated with 12 M urea, was added to this fraction (22 micrograms of PAI-1/ml of plasma), and a PAI-1 antigen peak with apparent mass 450 kDa (representing 65% of PAI-1 antigen and 85% of PAI activity) was isolated by gel filtration of this mixture. 3) The PAI-1.PAI-1-BP complex was further purified by immunoadsorption on an immobilized murine monoclonal antibody directed against PAI-1 (MA-7D4) and by elution with 4 M KSCN. 4) The complex was then dissociated by addition of excess human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and t-PA and PAI-1 antigen (t-PA.PAI-1 complexes and free t-PA and PAI-1) were removed by immunoadsorption on monoclonal antibodies directed against t-PA (MA-62E8) and against PAI-1 (MA-7D4 and MA-12A4). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of the purified material under nonreducing conditions revealed two bands with apparent mass approximately equal to 150 kDa and two bands with mass 74 and 68 kDa. Reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis displayed two main bands with apparent masses of 73 and 64 kDa. The PAI-1-BP reacts with urea-treated, but not with inactive PAI-1. t-PA dissociates the complex between PAI-1 and PAI-1-BP. PAI-1 in complex with PAI-1-BP is 2-3-fold more stable at 37 degrees C than purified PAI-1, suggesting that PAI-1-BP may stabilize PAI-1 in blood. The concentration of PAI-1-BP in plasma determined by titration with PAI-1 is approximately 130 mg/liter. The isolated PAI-1-BP was shown to be identical to S protein (vitronectin) both by cross-reactivity with monospecific rabbit antisera and by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The gel filtration behavior, mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and concentration in plasma suggest that PAI-1-BP is a multimer (presumably a dimer) of S protein accounting for approximately 35% of the S protein in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1553087448,"The structures of the entire population of sialylated asparagine-linked oligosaccharides present on bovine fetuin were elucidated. Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides were released from fetuin with N-glycanase, radiolabeled by reduction with NaB[3H]4, and fractionated by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ion-suppression amine adsorption HPLC, and concanavalin A affinity chromatography. The 3H-labeled oligosaccharide fractions obtained were analyzed by 500-MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing the presence of 23 distinct oligosaccharide structures. These oligosaccharides differed in extent of sialylation (3% mono-, 35% di-, 54% tri-, and 8% tetrasialylated), number of peripheral branches (17% di- and 83% tribranched), linkage (alpha 2,3 versus alpha 2,6) and location of sialic acid moieties, and linkage (beta 1,4 versus beta 1,3) of galactose residues. This represents the first time that the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of fetuin have been successfully fractionated and characterized as sialylated species. The sialylated oligosaccharides derived from fetuin were also used to further define the specificities of the lectins leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin and Ricinus communis agglutinin I. The behavior of these oligosaccharides during lectin affinity HPLC further establishes the structural features which predominate in the interaction of oligosaccharides with leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin and R. communis agglutinin I."
https://openalex.org/W1980558682,"Mechanosensitive ion channels use mechanical energy to gate the dissipation of electrochemical gradients across cell membranes. This function is fundamental to physiological processes such as hearing and touch. In electrophysiological studies of ion channels in the plasma membrane of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, channels were observed that were activated by, and adapted to, stretching of the membrane. Adaptation of channel activity to mechanical stimuli was voltage-dependent. Because these mechanosensitive channels pass both cations and anions, they may play a role in turgor regulation in this walled organism."
https://openalex.org/W1979989842,"Myeloid progenitor cells were highly purified from normal human bone marrow by positive immunoselection with high-affinity monoclonal antibodies linked to magnetic beads and were successfully infected in vitro with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). From 99 to 100 percent pure bone marrow cells expressing the CD34 phenotypic marker were obtained. These cells were devoid of mature myeloid or T cell surface and intracellular markers as analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry. HIV-1 particles were detected by supernatant reverse transcriptase activity and transmission electron microscopy 40 to 60 days after infection. Viral particles were predominantly observed assembling and accumulating from within intracellular membranes, while phenotypically the cells were observed to have differentiated into CD4+ monocytes. These studies have important implications in understanding the pathogenesis of HIV-1 as well as the possible cause of certain of the observed hematologic abnormalities in HIV-1 infection. They also indicate that the bone marrow may serve as a potentially important reservoir of HIV-1 in the body."
https://openalex.org/W2079473945,"Cells derived from lung biopsies and pleural effusions from AIDS patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) of the lungs were established in long-term culture with the aid of conditioned medium from HTLV-II-transformed T cells (HTLV-II CM). These AIDS-KS cells were similar to the so-called spindle cells in KS lesions and had some of their features. They produced factors that supported their own growth (autocrine) and the growth of other cells (paracrine), including umbilical vein endothelium and fibroblasts. That the AIDS-KS cells also expressed potent angiogenic activity was demonstrated by the chorioallantoic membrane assay and by subcutaneous inoculation of AIDS-KS cells into nude mice, which resulted in the development of angiogenic lesions composed of mouse cells and showing histological features similar to those of human KS lesions. These data suggest that AIDS-associated KS and possibly other types of KS may be initiated by signals that induce the growth of particular cells (spindle cells of lymphatic or vascular origin) and the expression of autocrine and paracrine activities."
https://openalex.org/W1494589518,"Platelet-derived growth factor, PDGF, purified from human platelets is a disulfide-bonded dimer consisting of two homologous polypeptide chains denoted A and B; it has not been known whether it is a heterodimer or a mixture of homodimers. We present here evidence that a major part of PDGF has a heterodimer structure. A highly homogeneous, 31-kDa PDGF was purified in the presence of protease inhibitors and shown to contain both chains by means of immunoprecipitations with peptide antisera specific for the A and B chains, respectively. The susceptibility of PDGF to mild acid treatment and its chromatographic behavior in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, as compared to A and B chain homodimers, is consistent with a heterodimer structure. Analysis of PDGF purified according to our routine, large scale procedure revealed the major part to have a heterodimer structure. In addition, B chain homodimers were also found. With the demonstration that a major part of PDGF purified from human platelets occurs as a heterodimer, all three dimeric forms of PDGF have been identified. The following nomenclature to distinguish the various forms is suggested: PDGF-AA, a homodimer of A chains; PDGF-AB, a heterodimer; PDGF-BB, a homodimer of B chains; PDGF, any dimeric form of A or B chains."
https://openalex.org/W1504737180,"Murine hybridoma cell lines secreting antibodies against the three bovine isozymes of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) were established: 6, 23, and 12 lines were obtained for PLC-I (150 kDa), PLC-II (145 kDa), and PLC-III (85 kDa), respectively. The antibodies were purified from ascites fluid, and their properties were studied in detail. All the antibodies cross-reacted with their corresponding PLC enzymes, but not with the other two isozymes, suggesting that the three enzymes contain very different antigenic determinants. The six antibodies elicited by bovine PLC-I also cross-reacted with human and rat enzyme, whereas three each from anti-PLC-II antibodies and anti-PLC-III antibodies did not react with the enzymes from different species. Each antibody exerts different effects on the phosphatidylinositol-hydrolyzing activity of PLC. The most inhibitory antibody for either isozyme PLC-I or PLC-II exhibits 80% inhibition, whereas no more than 20% inhibition was observed for the anti-PLC-III antibodies. Purified PLC-I frequently contains catalytically active 140- and 100-kDa forms and an inactive 41-kDa protein in addition to the intact 150-kDa form, probably due to its high sensitivity to an unidentified endogenous protease. The five anti-PLC-I antibodies which bind to the denatured 150-kDa polypeptide also recognized the 140-kDa form, whereas only three cross-reacted with the 100-kDa form, and the remaining two bound to the 41-kDa protein. Competitive binding studies with intact PLC enzymes and Western blot experiments with proteolytic digests revealed that the 6 anti-PLC-I, 23 anti-PLC-II, and 12 anti-PLC-III antibodies bind at least five, six, and seven different epitopes on PLC-I, PLC-II, and PLC-III, respectively. The fact that these monoclonal antibodies bind to different epitopes on the same enzyme allowed one to develop a highly specific and sensitive tandem radioimmunoassay for quantitating PLC-I, PLC-II, and PLC-III. The principle of the assay is that binding of an 125I-labeled antibody to the antigen immobilized by another antibody at a distinctive binding site is proportional to the amount of antigen present. By using this method, PLC-I, PLC-II, and PLC-III could be measured quantitatively in the presence of other proteins, detergents, lipids, polyanions, and metal ions, all of which greatly affect the activity of PLC enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2003599324,"In the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of skeletal muscle, the ryanodine receptor forms an aqueous pore identified as the calcium-release pathway that operates during excitation-contraction coupling. The purified ryanodine receptor channel has now been shown to have four properties usually associated with gap junction channels: (i) a large nonspecific voltage-dependent conductance consisting of several open states; (ii) an inhibition of open probability by low pH; (iii) an inhibition of open probability by calcium; and (iv) a sensitivity to blockade by heptanol and octanol but not other alcohols. This functional homology may provide an insight into the mechanism of how muscle cells transduce depolarization into an intracellular release of calcium."
https://openalex.org/W2105300860,"von Willebrand factor is a multifunctional adhesive protein of plasma, platelets, and endothelial cells that mediates a crucial interaction for normal hemostasis and thrombus formation by binding to platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib. We provide here evidence that this function involves two limited noncontiguous regions of the molecule, each contained within 15 amino acid residues, separated in the linear sequence by 205 residues, and maintained in close spatial proximity in the folded molecule by disulfide bonding. Definition of this chemical structure clarifies a fundamental mechanism of platelet adhesion to thrombogenic surfaces and sets the bases for obtaining synthetic replicas that may be used to modulate platelet function."
https://openalex.org/W1584725601,"High molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) functions as a cofactor for activation of plasma serine zymogens and as an inhibitor of tissue cysteine proteases. Cell surfaces to which HMWK binds may provide sites for regulation of these systems. Localization of these HMWK-dependent processes at sites of vascular injury may depend on its binding to specific receptors on endothelial cells. In culture, passaged human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) bind anti-HMWK antibody to the cell surface and contain 171 +/- 75 ng of HMWK/10(8) cells. [35S]Methionine-labeled HUVEC in culture synthesize a 120-kDa protein immunoisolated using an anti-kininogen antibody, and a 3500-nucleotide message for human HMWK was detected by Northern blot in RNA extracted from HUVEC. HUVEC also express unoccupied binding sites for HMWK on their surface. 125I-HMWK specifically binds to HUVEC in a reaction requiring Zn2+. 125I-HMWK binding to HUVEC is saturable at 4 degrees C but not at 23 degrees C. 125I-HMWK binds to HUVEC with equal affinity as unlabeled HMWK. Kallikrein, factor XII, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and thrombin do not inhibit 125I-HMWK binding to HUVEC. 125I-HMWK-HUVEC binding remains fully reversible at 60 min following the addition of a 50-fold molar excess HMWK. HUVEC express 9.3 +/- 2.0 X 10(5) (mean +/- S.E.) HMWK binding sites/cell (Kd = 52 +/- 13 nM). Both added and cell-bound 125I-HMWK migrate at 120 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the protein remains uncleaved upon binding to the HUVEC surface. These studies indicate that HUVEC synthesize HMWK and the HUVEC surface has a site for its expression. By synthesizing and localizing HMWK to the cell surface, endothelial cells may contribute to the activation of plasma's contact serine zymogens and regulation of tissue cysteine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1515069870,"A study of steady-state kinetics of polymerization by purified human immunodeficiency virus DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) has been conducted. DNA synthesis was examined using a system of poly(rA) as template, oligo(dT) as primer, and dTTP as nucleotide substrate. The substrate initial velocity patterns point to an ordered mechanism with template-primer adding first. Product inhibition kinetics with either pyrophosphate or phosphonoformate are consistent with this mechanism. The human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase acts processively in this replication system, but exhibits some probability of terminating after each dTMP addition to the nascent chain. The probability of terminating was approximately 20-fold higher after the first dTMP addition than after subsequent additions. With this information on the mode of polymerization, appropriate kinetic models and steady-state rate equations are discussed. In further studies, we found that a heterologous polynucleotide, poly(rC), is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme. The pattern of this inhibition is uncompetitive against template-primer, suggesting that interaction with free enzyme is not the mechanism of the inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1487090175,"Synthesis and secretion of basement membrane proteins by 3T3-L1 adipocytes were studied by metabolic labeling of the cells with [35S]methionine. Enhanced synthesis and secretion of many polypeptides of high molecular weight were observed by stimulating the adipose conversion of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with dexamethasone, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and insulin. Among these polypeptides, alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains of collagen were identified based on specific immunoprecipitation and digestion with bacterial collagenase. Synthesis and secretion of alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains were negligible in the fibroblasts, but remarkably enhanced in adipocytes. Based on specific immunoprecipitation of a sulfated polypeptide of 150 kDa, enhanced (6-fold) synthesis and secretion of entactin were also demonstrated. Immunoprecipitation with anti-laminin antiserum showed synthesis of three polypeptides with sizes corresponding to B subunits but failed to demonstrate synthesis of the A subunit. Synthesis of these laminin-related polypeptides remained constant during the conversion. Nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis showed intracellular assembly of three laminin-related polypeptides into binary and ternary complexes in a similar sequence of AB1B2 formation via B1B2 in embryonal carcinoma F9 (Morita, A., Sugimoto, E., and Kitagawa, Y. (1985) Biochem. J. 229, 259-264). The ternary complex of laminin in 3T3-L1 cells had a size significantly smaller than AB1B2 complex in F9 cells. In this complex, a novel subunit appears to take the place of the A subunit. Thus, a novel laminin complex is produced by 3T3-L1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2022592785,"The specificity of tRNAArg (arginine transfer RNA) for aminoacylation (its acceptor identity) were first identified by computer analysis and then examined with amber suppressor tRNAs in Escherichia coli. On replacing two nucleotides in tRNAPhe (phenylalanine transfer RNA) with the corresponding nucleotides from tRNAArg, the acceptor identity of the resulting tRNA was changed to that of tRNAArg. The nucleotides used in the identity transformation occupy a ""variable pocket"" structure on the surface of the tRNA molecule where two single-stranded loop segments interact. The middle nucleotide in the anticodon also probably contributes to the interaction, since an amber suppressor of tRNAArg had an acceptor identity for lysine as well as arginine."
https://openalex.org/W2038710104,"dorsal is one of the maternally active dorsal-ventral polarity genes of Drosophila and is closely related to the vertebrate proto-oncogene c-rel. Genetic experiments suggest that dorsal represents one of the last (if not the last) steps in the maternal pathway involved in establishing dorsal-ventral polarity in the early embryo. Even though the dorsal RNA is uniformly distributed in the embryo, we have found that the dorsal protein is specifically localized in peripheral nuclei of syncytial and cellular blastoderm stage embryos, and it is distributed in a ventral-to-dorsal gradient. These findings suggest possible mechanisms for how the dorsal protein may communicate maternal positional information to the zygotic genome."
https://openalex.org/W2035783204,"Pertussis toxin (PTX) is a major virulence factor in whooping cough and can elicit protective antibodies. Amino acid residues 8 to 15 of PTX subunit S1 are important for the adenosine diphosphate-ribosyltransferase activity associated with the pathobiological effects of PTX. Furthermore, this region contains at least a portion of an epitope that elicits both toxin-neutralizing and protective antibody responses in mice. The gene encoding the S1 subunit was subjected to site-specific mutagenesis in this critical region. A mutant containing a single amino acid substitution (Arg9----Lys) had reduced enzymatic activity (approximately 0.02% of control) while retaining the protective epitope. This analog S1 molecule may provide the basis for a genetically detoxified PTX with potential for use as a component of an acellular vaccine against whooping cough."
https://openalex.org/W1531330835,"In order to understand the structure and regulation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, cDNA clones encoding this enzyme have been isolated from rat prostate and human fibroblast cDNA libraries. The authenticity of the cDNAs was verified by: (a) transfecting the Chinese hamster ovary cells with the human cDNA in the pcD vector which resulted in a transient 10-20-fold increase in S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity in recipient cells; and (b) translating the mRNA formed by transcription of the cDNA insert in a reticulocyte lysate and recording an increase in S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity. The amino acid sequences deduced from the cDNAs indicate that the human proenzyme for this protein contains 334 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 38,331 whereas the rat proenzyme contains 333 amino acid residues. The human and rat enzymes are very similar having only 11 amino acid differences and the cDNAs are also closely related showing over 90% homology in the 1617-nucleotide overlap which was sequenced. A further indication of the highly conserved nature of mammalian S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases is that the amino acid sequences deduced from the human and the rat cDNAs contained peptide sequences identical to those previously reported for the purified bovine enzyme. In vitro transcription/translation experiments showed that the proenzyme is converted to two polypeptides of molecular weights about 32,000 and 6,000 in a processing reaction which generates the prosthetic pyruvate group and that the final enzyme contains both polypeptides. Two forms of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase mRNA (2.1 and about 3.4-3.6 kilobases) are present in human and rodent tissues and may originate from the utilization of two different polyadenylation signals. Southern blots of rat genomic DNA indicated that the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase gene belongs to a multigene family. Depletion of cellular polyamines by inhibitors or ornithine decarboxylase or the aminopropyltransferases led to an increase in the content of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase protein and mRNA, but the elevation in the mRNA was not sufficient to account for all of the change in the enzyme level, particularly in cells in which spermine was depleted."
https://openalex.org/W1580526233,"We have examined the effect of phorbol esters and cAMP elevating compounds on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) secretion. Phorbol esters induce a time- and dose-dependent increase in tPA release from endothelial cells, while forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, dibutyryl cAMP, and 8-bromo-cAMP had no significant stimulatory effect on tPA secretion. However, elevation of cAMP simultaneously with phorbol ester treatment potentiated the phorbol ester-induced release of tPA 6 times from 22.2 ng/ml with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) alone to 122.1 ng/ml (PMA and forskolin). Potentiation was dose-dependent (half-maximal potentiation = 4 microM forskolin), and tPA release was enhanced at all stimulatory concentrations of PMA with no change in the PMA concentrations causing half-maximal or maximum tPA release. The kinetics of release was also similar in PMA versus PMA-forskolin-treated cells. A 4-h delay was observed, enhanced release was transient, and was followed by the onset of a refractory period. In contrast, elevation of cAMP reduced constitutive secretion of PAI-1 by 30-40% and prevented the increase in PAI-1 secretion stimulated by PMA. Elevated cAMP also decreased the rate of PAI-1 deposition into the endothelial substratum. These studies indicate that activation of a cAMP-dependent pathway(s) in coordination with phorbol ester-induced responses plays a central role in modifying the tPA and PAI-1 secretion from endothelial cells, leading to a profibrinolytic state in the endothelial environment."
https://openalex.org/W2043729668,"The Mauriceville and Varkud mitochondrial plasmids of Neurospora are closely related DNA elements whose nucleotide sequences and genetic organization suggest relationships to retrotransposons and mitochondrial introns. Both plasmids potentially encode a reverse transcriptase-like protein of 710 amino acids. We show that mitochondria from the Mauriceville and Varkud strains contain a reverse transcriptase activity highly specific for endogeneous plasmid RNA in RNP preparations. The reverse transcriptase synthesizes full-length minus-strand DNA beginning at the 3' end of the plasmid transcript, which has tRNA-like characteristics similar to the 3' ends of plant viral RNAs. Our results suggest that the plasmids use a novel mechanism of reverse transcription, which may have evolved to utilize tRNA-like structures at the 3' ends of self-replicating RNAs. This mechanism may be ancestral to the standard retroviral mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2044318526,"L-A double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replicates in vivo in yeast in a conservative, asynchronous (first [+] strand then [−] strand), intraviral process. New particles are formed by packaging (+) strands. Added viral (+) single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is specifically bound by empty virus-like particles (VLPs) and, in a reaction requiring a host factor, is converted in vitro to dsRNA. We find that the isolated binding complex replicates only if it was formed in the presence of the host factor. The VLP minor 180 kd protein, but not the major coat protein, has ssRNA binding activity on Western blots. The 180 kd protein shares a common antigenic domain with the major coat protein, the latter known to be encoded by L-A dsRNA. The 180 kd protein, but not the major coat protein, also shares an antigenic domain with a sequence encoded by the 3′ end of the L-A (+) strand. Thus the 180 kd protein is also encoded by L-A dsRNA and consists of a major coat protein domain and a ssRNA binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1528716642,"When G0-arrested BALB/c 3T3 cells were treated sequentially with platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor, cells became responsive to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). In these primed competent cells, 1 nM IGF-I elicited an approximately 3-fold increase in the calcium influx rate. IGF-I-induced calcium influx was relatively slow in onset and continued for at least 2 h in the presence of IGF-I. When a single Ca2+ channel current was studied by the patch-clamp technique using the cell-attached mode, inward currents with unitary conductance of 19 pS were observed in the presence of 1 nM IGF-I in the patch pipette. IGF-I-sensitive inward current was independent of membrane potential and was activated by a high concentration of insulin. Accordingly, 1 nM IGF-I caused a gradual increase in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration measured by fura2. The action of IGF-I on calcium influx was dependent on extracellular calcium, and IGF-I did not stimulate calcium influx when extracellular calcium concentration was reduced to 10 microM. Both cobalt and tetramethrin blocked the action of IGF-I on calcium influx without affecting the binding of 125I-IGF-I. In primed competent cells, IGF-I-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation was dependent on extracellular calcium and was attenuated by cobalt and tetramethrin. When cell-bound 125I-IGF-I was cross-linked by use of disuccinimidyl suberate, a 130-kDa protein was radiolabeled. Affinity labeling of the 130-kDa protein, presumably the alpha-subunit of the IGF-I receptor, was blocked by excess amount of unlabeled IGF-I. These results suggest that relatively low concentrations of IGF-I stimulate calcium influx in primed competent BALB/c 3T3 cells by activating a calcium-permeable cation channel via the IGF-I receptor and that calcium influx may be a critical intracellular message of the progression activity of IGF-I."
https://openalex.org/W1607820942,"After 2 days of incubation of AR42J pancreatoma cells with 400 microM [3H]inositol, the specific radioactivity of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and the specific radioactivity of [3H]inositol were similar, indicating that isotopic equilibrium had been achieved. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) level in cells was estimated to be approximately 2 microM and was increased by substance P receptor activation to about 25 microM. HPLC analysis of [3H]inositol phosphates indicated that only 1,4,5-IP3, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, and inositol 4-monophosphate were increased upon receptor activation. There was no increase in inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (1,3,4,5-IP4), or in any of its metabolites. Incubation of [3H]1,4,5-IP3 with a cell homogenate did not result in the formation of [3H]1,3,4,5-IP4. Therefore, it appears that 1,4,5-IP3 3-kinase is either not present or not functional under these assay conditions. Substance P increased cytosolic calcium levels in fura-2-loaded cells from about 600 nM to 2.5 microM. This increase in Ca2+ was partially attenuated in the absence of extracellular calcium, indicating that in AR42J cells, substance P stimulation appears to activate calcium signaling through both Ca2+ entry and intracellular Ca2+ release. These modes of Ca2+ mobilization occur without an increase in 1,3,4,5-IP4 or any of its metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1561938123,"Abstract Most eukaryotic cells encode principally a 2.5-kilobase (kb) transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 mRNA. However, we have found two major TGF-beta 1 RNA species, 3.5 and 2.5 kb long, in porcine tissues. The 3.5-kb species has a longer 3'-untranslated sequence generated by the selection of an alternate polyadenylation site. There is a 117-nucleotide sequence within this unique 3' region, which is similar to the PRE-1 repetitive sequence of unknown function, reported earlier in the porcine genome. We have also cloned and characterized an alternately spliced mRNA species specific for the TGF-beta 1 gene, in which exons IV and V of the corresponding human TGF-beta 1 gene are deleted. The nucleotide sequence of this cDNA clone predicts a putative precursor protein of 256 amino acids; the N-terminal 211 amino acids of this putative protein are identical to the TGF-beta 1 precursor protein (exons I, II, and III of the human TGF-beta 1 gene), but the C-terminal 45 amino acids are distinct, due to a frameshift in the translation of exons VI and VII. In addition we provide data for the existence of other mRNA species generated in a tissue-specific manner either by alternate splicing or by heterogeneous 5' leader sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1511157689,"Na,K-ATPase activity, Na,K-ATPase alpha- and beta-subunit mRNA abundance (mRNA alpha and mRNA beta), and gene transcription rates were determined in kidney cortex and liver of hypothyroid and triiodothyronine (T3)-treated rats. In hypothyroid rats, Na,K-ATPase activity (expressed per unit of DNA) was 3.6-fold greater in kidney cortex than liver, and the abundance of mRNA alpha and mRNA beta in kidney cortex exceeded that of liver by 2.8- and 5.2-fold, respectively. In vitro nuclear run-on analysis revealed similar rates of Na,K-ATPase alpha and beta gene transcription in nuclei isolated from either kidney cortex or liver. Administration of T3 for 72 h elicited a 2.3-fold stimulation of renal Na,K-ATPase activity that was associated with a 3.1- and 2.6-fold increase of mRNA alpha and mRNA beta content, respectively. In contrast, T3 induced a 1.3-fold stimulation of liver Na,K-ATPase activity accompanied by a 7.3-fold increase in mRNA alpha and no change in mRNA beta abundance. Transcription rates of alpha and beta genes (assayed by nuclear run-on) in renal cortex were both stimulated 1.8-fold in response to T3 injection. Similarly in liver nuclei, T3 treatment produced a 1.4- and 1.3-fold stimulation in the rate of alpha and beta gene transcription, respectively. These results indicate that significant discrepancies exist in the quantitative relationships between control and T3-induced changes in renal and hepatic enzyme activity, mRNA abundance and rate of gene transcription, and imply that the T3-induced increase in Na,K-ATPase abundance is mediated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps."
https://openalex.org/W1556565864,"Interleukin 6 (IL 6) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) regulate the expression of acute phase plasma proteins in rat and human hepatoma cells. Phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), partially mimics the stimulatory effect of IL-6 but reduces that effect of IL-1. TPA and IL-6 act synergistically. These regulatory properties of TPA are also manifested in HepG2 cells transiently transfected with an indicator gene construct carrying the IL-1/IL-6 regulatory enhancer element of the rat alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene. IL-6 and IL-1 act independently of TPA-inducible kinase C, and of changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. However, prolonged pretreatment of HepG2 cells with TPA results in a drastically reduced cytokine response that is proportional to the loss of cell surface binding activity for the cytokine. These data suggest that hormones activating protein kinase C probably play a contributing role in stimulating the expression of acute phase plasma protein genes but they may be crucial in controlling the responsiveness of liver cells to inflammatory cytokines during subsequent stages of the hepatic acute phase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1565654723,"Type X collagen, expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes, consists of homotrimeric molecules with subunits that are only about one-half the size of the polypeptides of fibrillar collagens. In this report we describe for the first time the complete primary structure of type X collagen, based on cloning and sequencing of cDNA and genomic DNA. A comparison between the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA and genomic DNA clones has also allowed determination of the complete exon structure of the type X collagen gene. Our results demonstrate that the primary translation product of the chicken type X collagen mRNA is 682 amino acid residues long with a calculated molecular mass of 67,317 Da for the nonhydroxylated form. This calculated molecular mass is in excellent agreement with the observed electrophoretic mobility of cell-free translation products with both poly(A)+ RNA isolated from chondrocytes as well as RNA transcribed in vitro from a full length cDNA construct. It is also in agreement with the observed size of type X collagen polypeptides isolated from the media of cultured hypertrophic chondrocytes. Thus, our data exclude the possibility of a high molecular weight precursor form of type X collagen. Our results also confirm that the chicken type X gene has a most unusual exon structure when compared to other vertebrate collagen genes. The gene has only three exons. One exon (97 base pairs (bp)), codes for most of the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA, a second exon (159 bp) codes for the signal peptide and a short non-triple-helical domain, while the third exon (2136 bp) contains the coding region for the entire triple-helix and a large non-triple-helical carboxyl domain."
https://openalex.org/W1488043827,"The protein involucrin, synthesized by human keratinocytes, contains 585 amino acids, largely in the form of 10 amino acid repeats, each containing glutamines in 3 conserved positions. Involucrin is a substrate for the keratinocyte transglutaminase and is labeled by the cosubstrate amine, glycine ethyl ester. Study of tryptic peptides of involucrin shows that a single glutamine (residue 496), located 89 residues from the C-terminal end, is preferentially labeled by the enzyme. Additional glutamine residues become reactive when the molecule is fragmented. The C-terminal end, isolated as a cyanogen bromide fragment of 275 residues, is labeled equally at 2 glutamine residues. The polypeptide containing residues 148 to 280 accepts practically no amine while in intact involucrin but as a free fragment is labeled at multiple glutamine residues. It is concluded that the C-terminal and N-terminal ends of the protein are directive influences in that they suppress the reactivity of a number of glutamine residues in the intact molecule, leaving one glutamine highly preferred by the transglutaminase."

https://openalex.org/W1494345685,"Chemically synthesized genes for bovine and human fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) were expressed in heterologous microorganisms. Although the intracellular expression or secretion of acidic and basic FGFs in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae yielded recombinant growth factors with high biological activity, the resulting proteins had structural microheterogeneity due to modified amino termini. Expression of amino-terminal extended forms of human acidic and basic FGFs in S. cerevisiae gave rise to soluble, but cell-associated polypeptides, with potent biological activity. These yeast-derived proteins were processed in vivo by removal of initiation codon-derived methionine residues and by amino-terminal acetylation. Both of these processes have been observed in mammalian tissues. The yeast systems described here, therefore, provide a good model system for the expression of FGFs as intracellular proteins, but more importantly they give high levels of authentically processed human FGFs with many potential medical applications. Since the recombinant proteins have all the biological activities of their native counterparts, their possible applications in wound healing, tissue grafting, nerve regeneration, and treatment of ischemia are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1523482484,"The beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin contains two asparagine (N)-linked oligosaccharides. To examine the structural and functional roles of these oligosaccharide units in vivo, we constructed mutant genes containing alterations in either the asparagine or threonine codons of the two glycosylation consensus sequences and inserted them into a eukaryotic expression vector. Wild-type and mutant CG beta proteins were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells alone or in the presence of native alpha subunit. Pulse-chase analysis of the beta-expressing clones showed that absence of the second N-linked sugar but not the first slows secretion 1.6-1.8-fold; absence of both N-linked units slows secretion 2-2.4-fold. Analysis of dimer clones reveals that greater than 80% of the native and glycosylation mutant CG beta subunits are secreted as dimer. However, pulse-chase analysis of these clones also reveals that the mutants completely devoid of N-linked sugars but not the single site mutants are slow to assemble with the alpha subunit. Thus, in vivo the two N-linked oligosaccharides of CG beta are critical for efficient secretion and assembly with the alpha subunit and are likely important for proper folding of the CG beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1535806813,"The effect of Ca2+ on steroid production was examined in electropermeabilized bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa and fasciculata cells. The cells were superfused with a medium mimicking cytosolic ionic content but deprived of Ca2+. The permeabilized glomerulosa cells produced aldosterone at a low basal rate. Upon addition of NADP+ to the medium, a transient and concentration-dependent (EC50 = 6 microM) peak of aldosterone production occurred. When the superfusion medium was supplemented with buffered Ca2+ at submicromolar concentrations, a concentration-dependent and sustained increase of aldosterone output was observed. The maximal response (2-3 times the basal secretion rate) was achieved with 1-2 microM ambient free Ca2+, and the EC50 for Ca2+ was 0.5 microM. The continuous presence of NADP+ was found to be necessary for a Ca2+ effect. The Ca2+-induced aldosterone response was entirely blocked by ruthenium red (1 microM), an inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, and by W-7 (5 microM), a calmodulin inhibitor. Qualitatively and quantitatively similar results were obtained for corticosterone production in adrenal fasciculata cells. These results show that permeabilized adrenal cortical cells retain the ability to produce steroids. Moreover, Ca2+ influx into the mitochondria and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent reactions appear to be critical steps in the activation of steroidogenesis. These studies provide a further direct link between cytosolic free calcium concentration and biological responses induced by steroidogenic, calcium-mobilizing stimulators in the adrenal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1483126826,"125I-Hyaluronic acid (HA) uniquely modified only at the reducing end (Raja, R.H., LeBoeuf, R. D., Stone, G.W., and Weigel, P.H. (1984) Anal. Biochem. 139, 168-177) binds specifically to rat liver endothelial cells in suspension or in culture. About 67-85% of the HA binding sites in isolated cells in suspension and 50% in cultured cells were intracellular, since they were exposed after permeabilizing cells with digitonin. Specific 125I-HA binding at 4 degrees C varied from 60 to 80% for intact cells and from 70 to 90% for permeabilized cells. Freshly isolated permeabilized cells bound about 500,000 HA molecules/cell at saturation. Within 5 h of culture, however, total HA binding decreased to 250,000 molecules/cells and then remained constant for at least 36 h. Surface HA receptor activity was essentially the same on cultured cells or cells in suspension (approximately 10(5)/cell). Cultured cells had 1.8 x 10(5) fewer intracellular receptors/cell. The affinities of surface and intracellular receptors of cells in culture and in suspension were essentially the same. The average Kd, determined by equilibrium binding studies, was 5.8 +/- 2.8 x 10(-8) M (n = 12). Dissociation of bound 125I-HA from permeable cultured cells was rapid (t1/2 = 30.9 min;kappa off = 3.7 x 10(-4) s-1). A variety of carbohydrates had essentially identical effects on 125I-HA binding to surface or total cellular receptors in cells in culture or in suspension. Chondroitin sulfate and heparin competed almost as effectively as unlabeled HA for 125I-HA binding at 4 degrees C. Other saccharides including polygalacturonic acid, dextran, glucuronic acid, and N-acetylglucosamine competed poorly or not at all. We conclude that (i) the 125I-HA binding sites within liver endothelial cells are HA receptors, identical in affinity and specificity to those on the cell surface; (ii) the distribution of cellular HA receptors is similar to other receptor systems with about 50-80% being intracellular; (iii) the liver endothelial cell HA receptor recognizes several glycosaminoglycans; and (iv) the liver endothelial receptor is different in function and characteristics than the fibroblast HA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1973972643,"Mycobacterium leprae induces T cell reactivity and protective immunity in the majority of exposed individuals, but the minority that develop leprosy exhibit various types of immunopathology. Thus, the definition of epitopes on M. leprae antigens that are recognized by T cells from different individuals might result in the development of an effective vaccine against leprosy. A sequence from the 65-kD protein of this organism was recognized by two HLA-DR2-restricted, M. leprae-specific helper T cell clones that were derived from a tuberculoid leprosy patient. Synthetic peptides were used to define this epitope as Leu-Gln-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-Leu-Asp-Lys-Leu. A similar peptide that was derived from the third hypervariable region of the HLA-DR2 chain, Glu-Gln-Ala-Arg-Ala-Ala-Val-Asp-Thr-Tyr, also activated the same clones. The unexpected cross-reactivity of this M. leprae-specific DR2-restricted T cell epitope with a DR2 peptide may have to be considered in the design of subunit vaccines against leprosy."
https://openalex.org/W2093165899,"Mature T cells and medullary thymocytes bear either the CD4 or CD8 differentiation antigen. Precursor cells in the thymus express neither CD4 nor CD8 (CD4-8-), but most cortical thymocytes are CD4+8+. Whether CD4+ and CD8+ mature T cells arise directly from CD4-8- precursors or from a CD4+8+ intermediate remains unresolved. In this study, methylation of the CD8 gene in murine T cells and thymocytes was examined. There was progressive demethylation of the CD8 gene in the thymus during the transition from CD4-8- to CD4+8+. A similar pattern of demethylation of the CD8 gene was seen in CD4+ mature T cells, suggesting previous expression of CD8 in the CD4+ lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1591458908,"Adenylate cyclase (ATP-pyrophosphate lyase (cyclizing); EC 4.6.1.1) in the human keratinocyte cell line SCC 12F was potentiated by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phorbol-12,13-diacetate, and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol. Keratinocytes exposed to TPA showed a 2-fold enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity when assayed in the presence of isoproterenol or GTP. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for both isoproterenol and GTP were unaltered by TPA treatment of the cells. Basal adenylate cyclase activity in membranes from TPA-treated cultures was also increased 2-fold relative to activity in control membranes. Potentiation of adenylate cyclase activity was dependent on the concentration of TPA to which the keratinocytes were exposed (EC50 for TPA = 3 nM). TPA actions on adenylate cyclase were maximal after 15 min of incubation of the cells with the compound, correlating well with the time course of translocation of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) from cytosol to membrane. The action of cholera toxin on adenylate cyclase was additive with TPA. In contrast, pertussis toxin actions on adenylate cyclase were not additive with TPA. Treatment of control cells with pertussis toxin activated adenylate cyclase 1.5-fold, whereas cells exposed to pertussis toxin for 6 h followed by TPA for 15 min showed the same 2-fold increase in adenylate cyclase activity as observed in membranes from cells exposed to TPA without prior exposure to pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was increased 2-fold in membranes from SCC 12F cells exposed to TPA, indicating an increase in the alpha beta gamma form of Gi. These data suggest that exposure of human keratinocytes to phorbol esters increases adenylate cyclase activity by a protein kinase C-mediated increase in the heterotrimeric alpha beta gamma form of Gi resulting in decreased inhibition of basal adenylate cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2059386629,"In most studies of synaptic currents in mammalian central neurons, preparations have been used in which synaptic currents are recorded at some distance from the synapse itself. This procedure introduces problems in interpretation of the kinetics and voltage-dependent properties of the synaptic current. These problems have now been overcome by the development of a preparation in which presynaptic vesicle-containing boutons have been coisolated with the soma of individual neurons, thus providing the opportunity to study synaptic currents under conditions of both adequate voltage control and internal ionic perfusion. Spontaneous synaptic currents mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid and excitatory amino acids were recorded from neurons isolated from a mammalian medial solitary tract nucleus. Calcium- and depolarization-dependent spontaneous currents of several to hundreds of picoamperes occurred with rapid rise times of 0.8 to 3 milliseconds and decays at least ten times as long."
https://openalex.org/W1586511107,"The role of protein kinase C in luteinizing hormone (LH) release was analyzed in studies on the actions of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and phorbol esters in cultured pituitary cells. During incubation in normal medium, GnRH stimulated LH release with an ED50 of 0.35 nM. Incubation in Ca2+-deficient medium (Ca2+-free, 10 microM) substantially decreased but did not abolish the LH responses to GnRH. The extracellular Ca2+-dependent component of GnRH action could be mimicked by high K+ concentrations, consistent with the presence of voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) in pituitary gonadotrophs. Ca2+ channel agonist (Bay K 8644) and antagonist (nifedipine) analogs, respectively, enhanced or partially inhibited LH responses to GnRH and also to K+, the latter confirming the participation of two types of VSCC (dihydropyridine-sensitive and -insensitive) in K+-induced secretion. Phorbol esters, including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibenzoate, and 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-diacetate, stimulated LH release with ED50s of 5, 10, and 1000 nM, respectively, and with about 70% of the efficacy of GnRH. Phorbol ester-stimulated LH secretion was decreased but not abolished by progressive reduction of [Ca2+]e in the incubation medium, and the residual LH response was identical with that elicited by GnRH in Ca2+-deficient medium. TPA increased [Ca2+]i to a peak after 20 s in normal medium but not in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) promotes calcium entry but can also mediate secretory responses without changes in calcium influx and [Ca2+]i. The extracellular Ca2+-dependent action of TPA on LH release was blocked by Co2+. However, nifedipine did not alter TPA action on [Ca2+]i and LH release. These observations indicate that protein kinase C can participate in GnRH-induced LH release that is independent of Ca2+ entry, but also promotes the influx of extracellular Ca2+ through dihydropyridine-insensitive Ca2+-channels."
https://openalex.org/W1495596527,"Transcription of the Bombyx mori fibroin gene in a posterior silk gland extract can be separated into three functional steps on the basis of sensitivity to Sarkosyl: 1) formation of an initiation complex, which is blocked by 0.025% Sarkosyl; 2) conversion of the initiation complex to an elongation complex, a step sensitive to 0.05% Sarkosyl; 3) the subsequent elongation of RNA chain which occurs in the presence of 0.05% Sarkosyl. Whereas the last two steps are rapid and unaffected by template topology, the first step is slow and affected by DNA conformation. In the posterior silk gland extract, closed circular DNA forms a superhelical state and supports more rapid assembly of the initiation complex than linear DNA does. Both DNA supercoiling and rapid assembly of the initiation complex require ATP and are abolished by the addition of a topoisomerase II inhibitor VP16. These results suggest that DNA supercoiling enhances the fibroin gene transcription by facilitating formation of the initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1531167536,"Expression of an amylase/CAT hybrid gene was analyzed in transgenic mice. The amylase promoter was derived from a pancreatic amylase gene whose expression is repressed in diabetic animals. Pancreas-specific expression of the amylase/chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) construct was observed in two independent transgenic lines. Correct initiation of transcription was demonstrated by protection of an anti-sense riboprobe. To evaluate the insulin dependence of the hybrid gene, diabetes was induced by treatment with streptozotocin. As a result of this treatment, pancreatic CAT activity was reduced to undetectable levels. Subsequent administration of insulin restored CAT activity to normal levels. The abundance of CAT transcripts was also greatly reduced in diabetic pancreas. These studies localize the determinants of pancreas specificity and insulin dependence to the region between -208 and +19 of the mouse pancreatic Amy-2.2 gene. The results are consistent with an effect of insulin on amylase transcription, rather than post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA processing or stability."
https://openalex.org/W1541680543,"Functional properties of acetylcholine receptors from intact TE671 human medulloblastoma cells were examined using tracer ion flux, ligand competition against 125I-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin binding, and single channel recording measurements. 125I-Labeled alpha-bungarotoxin binds to surface receptors with the forward rate constant 1.8 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 and dissociates with the rate constant 4.6 X 10(-5) s-1, at 21 degrees C; the apparent dissociation constant is 2.6 X 10(-10) M. alpha-Bungarotoxin binds to at least two sites/receptor, but blocks agonist-induced 22Na+ uptake when bound to only one site. The reversible antagonists, dimethyl-d-tubocurarine and gallamine, occupy two sites which exhibit nearly equivalent affinities, but block agonist-induced uptake by occupying only one site. Strong agonists activate rapid sodium uptake with relatively low affinity, but desensitize with a much higher affinity; among agonists, the ratio of low to high affinity dissociation constants ranges from 1600 to 4000. By using the estimated dissociation constants, the allosteric model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (MWC) can be fitted to the concentration dependencies of both steady-state agonist occupancy and desensitization. The fitting analysis discloses an allosteric constant of 3 X 10(-5), which is the ratio of activatable to desensitized receptors in the absence of agonist. The rate of recovery from desensitization can exceed the rate of onset of desensitization elicited by low concentrations of agonist, further supporting the general MWC framework. Single channel recordings show that the channel opening probability is greater than 0.7 at high agonist concentrations. Favorable channel opening is shown to only slightly oppose strong desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1498862940,"Abstract Four monoclonal antibodies to the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor were established by fusing human peripheral lymphocytes of patients from Graves' disease with a human myeloma cell line. Of two antibodies with TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin activity (TBII), one inhibited TSH stimulation of adenylate cyclase and another stimulated adenylate cyclase. These antibodies showed competitive and noncompetitive modes of binding inhibition, respectively. Of the other two antibodies without TBII activity, one stimulated adenylate cyclase and the other inhibited TSH stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Of the two antibodies, which inhibited TSH stimulation of adenylate cyclase, one with TBII activity inhibited stimulation of adenylate cyclase by stimulating antibody with TBII activity, but another without TBII activity inhibited stimulation by both stimulating antibodies with or without TBII activity. These inhibitory antibodies did not influence the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by Forskolin and guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate compounds which are known to affect other parts of the receptor-adenylate cyclase system than the receptor unit. Four antibodies with heterogeneous potencies to the TSH receptor reacted with glycoproteins extracted from thyroid membranes. One stimulating antibody without TBII activity also interacted with the glycolipid fraction of the membrane preparation, and the binding decreased after desialylation or deglycosylation of the membrane components. In order to identify the binding sites of these monoclonal antibodies, receptor proteins interacting with antibodies were visualized by Western blot analysis and by the label transfer cross-linking method. All of these antibodies with different characteristics reacted with a 56-kDa molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1509586298,"Potassium extrusion in bacteria is thought to play a role in the regulation of the cytoplasmic pH; in several organisms, it has been ascribed to secondary antiport of K+ for protons. Streptococcus faecalis exhibited a distinctive pattern: potassium extrusion occurred only when the cytoplasmic pH was alkaline and required the generation of ATP. The key observation is that glycolyzing cells suspended in an alkaline medium extruded K+, even against a K+ concentration gradient, provided the medium contained a weak permeant base (e.g. diethanolamine or methylamine). The amines render the cytoplasmic pH alkaline; when conditions were arranged to keep the cytoplasm neutral, no K+ extrusion was seen. Potassium extrusion required the presence of either glucose or arginine and was unaffected by protonophores and by inhibition of the F1Fo-ATPase. When the medium contained [14C]methylamine, the cells accumulated the base to an extent stoichiometrically equivalent to the K+ lost. Concurrently, the cytoplasmic pH fell from 8.8 to 7.6, at which point K+ extrusion ceased. The results suggest that K+ extrusion is due to an ATP-driven transport system that expels K+ by exchange for H+ and is active only at alkaline cytoplasmic pH."
https://openalex.org/W1535908151,"Studies were conducted to determine if the expression of the gene for retinol-binding protein (RBP) and/or transthyretin (TTR) could be induced upon differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma cells to either visceral endoderm or parietal endoderm. Both TTR mRNA and RBP mRNA were undetectable in the undifferentiated F9 stem cells and in F9 cells differentiated to parietal endoderm. However, TTR mRNA and RBP mRNA were both detected in F9 cell aggregates differentiated to embryoid bodies (which contain visceral endoderm-like cells) by treatment of the aggregates in suspension with retinoic acid. TTR mRNA was observed at 3 days, and RBP mRNA at 5 days, after treatment of the F9 cell aggregates with retinoic acid. Both TTR mRNA and RBP mRNA were found to be specifically localized by in situ hybridization in the outer layer of cells (the visceral endoderm-like cells) of the embryoid bodies. Finally, synthesis and secretion of both RBP and TTR by F9 cell embryoid bodies was demonstrated by specific immunoprecipitation of each newly synthesized protein from the culture medium. These data thus demonstrate the production and presence of RBP mRNA and TTR mRNA, and the synthesis and secretion of RBP and TTR, by F9 cell embryoid bodies (specifically by visceral endoderm-like cells). This finding suggests that these two proteins may be synthesized by rodent embryos extremely early in embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1580853686,"Eight monoclonal antibodies are described which are directed against the renal Na+-D-glucose cotransporter. In porcine renal brush-border membranes, the antibodies either bind to one or to three polypeptides which have been identified as components of the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter (Neeb, M., Kunz, U., and Koepsell, H., (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10718-10727). Their molecular weights and isoelectric points are 75,000 and pH 5.5, 60,000 and pH 5.2, and 47,000 and pH 5.4. Six antibodies were able to influence Na+-dependent D-glucose uptake and/or Na+-dependent high affinity phlorizin binding. In the presence of Na+, the binding of all antibodies to native membrane proteins was altered by D-glucose but not by D-mannose. Since this effect was observed with D-glucose concentrations less than 1 x 10(-8) M, a high affinity D-glucose-binding site on the D-glucose transporter has been implied. Some of the antibodies probably interact also with other Na+-coupled transporters since their binding was altered by micromolar concentrations of L-lactate, L-alanine, or L-glutamate but not by the nontransported control substances D-alanine and D-glutamate. L-lactate increased the binding of one antibody in the absence but not in the presence of D-glucose. Effects of L-lactate and L-alanine on the binding of another antibody were only observed when D-glucose was present. Thus, some epitopes on the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter are altered by D-glucose and also by substrates of other Na+ cotransporters. This finding suggests functional coupling of different Na+-cotransport systems."
https://openalex.org/W1485207756,"Insulin at physiological concentrations can suppress catecholamine activation of the membrane transport of long chain fatty acids in the adipocyte. We have previously shown that the stimulatory effect of catecholamines was mediated by a beta-receptor interaction and cAMP (Abumrad, N.A., Park, C.R., and Whitesell, R. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13082-13086). In this study we have investigated the mechanism of insulin action to antagonize transport activation. Fatty acid transport was stimulated using different cAMP derivatives with varying susceptibilities to hydrolysis by the cAMP-degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase. Insulin was effective in antagonizing the effect of cAMP analogs which were good substrates for the phosphodiesterase and failed to suppress the effect of those which were poorly hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Addition of increasing concentrations (1-100 microM) of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) to norepinephrine (0.1 microgram/ml) gradually abolished insulin's antagonism. Insulin was completely ineffective in inhibiting stimulation by norepinephrine and 20 microM methylisobutylxanthine. Also consistent with involvement of cAMP lowering in insulin action was the finding that adenosine removal greatly diminished insulin's responsiveness. Treatment of cells with adenosine deaminase (1 unit/ml) enhanced the effect of norepinephrine by about 30%. A 10-fold higher range of insulin concentrations was then required to produce inhibition of fatty acid transport. The effect of adenosine removal was reversed by addition of phenylisopropyladenosine (500 nM), which is resistant to hydrolysis by the deaminase. Finally, exposure of insulin-treated cells (1 nM for 5 min) to dinitrophenol (1 mM for 5 min) reversed insulin action, consistent with reports of reversal of insulin's activation of the phosphodiesterase. In conclusion, our studies support the involvement of cAMP lowering in insulin's antagonism of fatty acid transport stimulation in the adipocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1591666324,"Half of the protein S in plasma is present as a complex with a C4b-binding protein (C4bp), a complement component (Mr 570,000). In this study, the protein S-binding site on C4bp was examined by using monoclonal anti-C4bp-IgGs. C4bp was cleaved by chymotryptic digestion into seven NH2-terminal arm fragments (Mr 48,000) and a COOH-terminal core fragment (Mr 160,000). The COOH-terminal fragment inhibited the cofactor activity of protein S and its binding to C4bp in a dose-dependent manner. A monoclonal anti-C4bp-IgG (MFbp16), which binds to the COOH-terminal fragment, inhibited the binding of protein S to C4bp. The chymotryptic digest of the reduced and carboxymethylated COOH-terminal fragment was subjected to MFbp16-Sepharose 4B column affinity chromatography, and a peptide of Mr 2,500 was obtained. Protein S bound to the Mr 2,500 peptide, and this binding was inhibited by C4bp in a dose-dependent manner. The sequence of this peptide corresponded to Ser447-Tyr467 near the COOH terminus of the C4bp subunit. MFbp16, which bound to Mr 570,000 C4bp (C4bp-high), did not bind to Mr 510,000 C4bp (C4bp-low) in human plasma that does not form a complex with protein S. This suggests that C4bp-low lacks the protein S-binding site present in the COOH-terminal region of C4bp-high. Since C4bp-low also dissociates into identical subunits when reduced, the interchain disulfide bond region that links the seven subunits of C4bp appears to be closer to the NH2-terminal end than the protein S-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1549627927,"Northern blot data as well as immunocytochemical and immunoblotting experiments indicate that the sponge Geodia cydonium contains the ras gene (or ras-related gene). The ras gene transcript has a size of 1.5 kilobases and the ras gene product has an Mr of 23,000-26,000. While dissociated G. cydonium cells lack ras gene product, ras gene expression can be induced by incubating the cells with the cell-binding fragment of the homologous aggregation factor. Maximal expression was observed 10-15 h after addition of the fragment. The sponge ras protein was partially purified by immunoprecipitation and bound GTP with a dissociation constant of 1.8 x 10(-6) M. It was found to be associated with the cell membrane. Autoradiographic studies revealed that the ras protein binds to the plasma membrane-associated anti-aggregation receptor and thereby mediates the mitogenic response, caused by the homologous lectin. It is hypothesized that sponges are provided in addition to the aggregation factor-caused and protein kinase C-mediated pathway with a second mechanism of transduction of mitotic signals, the lectin-caused and ras-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1565043960,"The accessibility of histone H5 in chromatin was examined with monoclonal antibodies recognizing several epitopes of the globular region (GH5) of the histone (Rozalski, M., Lafleur, L., and Ruiz-Carrillo, A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14379-14385). The stoichiometry of the chromatin-antibody complexes indicated that while 0-86% of the H5 molecules were able to react, depending on the particular epitope, the extent of antibody binding to relaxed chromatin (in 5 mM KCl) and condensed chromatin (in 100 mM KCl or 0.35 mM MgCl2) was virtually identical. This indicates that the topography of H5 does not change during the conformational transition of chromatin. The data suggest that H5 is not completely internalized in the 30-nm fiber or that the fiber is flexible enough to allow full exposure of the GH5 epitopes. Several control experiments, including monoclonal antibody binding, sedimentation analysis, DNase II digestion, and glutaraldehyde cross-linking, showed that epitope accessibility is not due to H5 exchange or to perturbation of the chromatin fiber. The accessibility of GH5 suggests ways in which inactive chromatin may be unfolded in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1665231851,"Kinetic and titration analyses are used to elucidate the mechanism by which Xenopus transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), a protein required for 5 S RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III, promotes DNA renaturation. TFIIIA promotes 50% renaturation of complementary strands (303 bases) in 45 s. Analyses of the renaturation kinetics indicate the rate-limiting step in this TFIIIA-dependent reaction is first order. TFIIIA-dependent DNA renaturation is a stoichiometric rather than a catalytic process. The renaturation rates for specific and nonspecific DNA are very similar, indicating lack of sequence specificity in this TFIIIA-dependent process. In the nanomolar concentration range of protein and DNA, renaturation occurs at a ratio of about one TFIIIA molecule/single strand (303 bases). Elevated reaction temperatures strongly stimulate TFIIIA-dependent DNA renaturation; at 45 degrees C, renaturation of the 303-base pair fragment nears completion in about 5 s. The ability of TFIIIA to rapidly promote DNA renaturation is unique when compared with Escherichia coli recA protein, single-stranded DNA binding protein, or bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein. This mechanism by which TFIIIA promotes DNA renaturation is compatible with features of 5 S RNA gene transcription."

The long term growth rate of GH-cells in medium in which chloride was exchanged with isethionate was completely normal, but, by 48 h, isethionate substitution resulted in a 70% decrease in the concentration of internal and secreted prolactin. Isethionate caused a much smaller reduction in growth hormone production (less than 20%). These results suggest that exchange of chloride with isethionate is inhibiting the synthesis of prolactin. Reduction of intracellular levels of prolactin in cells grown in isethionate-containing medium was evident by 30 h, and the level of prolactin was reduced 92% at 96 h. This reduction in the internal concentrations of prolactin was reversed when the cells were returned to normal medium containing chloride with a t1/2 of 48 h. Addition of epidermal growth factor and the calcium channel agonist BAY K 8644 to cells in medium containing chloride increased internal prolactin by 400%, and isethionate exchange reduced the response by 85%. To confirm that isethionate exchange was inhibiting the synthesis of prolactin, mRNA concentrations for prolactin and actin were determined. Both basal and hormone-stimulated levels of prolactin mRNA were reduced 70 to 90% by isethionate exchange, while actin mRNA levels did not change. To determine whether the effect of isethionate was at the level of gene transcription, GH-cells were transfected with a prolactin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion gene and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression was assessed using cells in chloride and isethionate-containing media. Both basal and hormone-stimulated synthesis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase driven by the prolactin promoter was inhibited by isethionate exchange. These studies demonstrate that exchange of medium chloride with isethionate inhibits the synthesis of prolactin at the level of transcription."
