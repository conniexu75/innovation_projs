Monitoring online data related to COVID-19 vaccine candidates can track vaccine misinformation in real-time and assist in negating its impact. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, understand their context, and then review interventions to manage this misinformation and increase vaccine acceptance.In June 2020, a multi-disciplinary team was formed to review and collect online rumors and conspiracy theories between 31 December 2019-30 November 2020. Sources included Google, Google Fact Check, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, fact-checking agency websites, and television and newspaper websites. Quantitative data were extracted, entered in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed descriptively using the statistical package R version 4.0.3. We conducted a content analysis of the qualitative information from news articles, online reports and blogs and compared with findings from quantitative data. Based on the fact-checking agency ratings, information was categorized as true, false, misleading, or exaggerated.We identified 637 COVID-19 vaccine-related items: 91% were rumors and 9% were conspiracy theories from 52 countries. Of the 578 rumors, 36% were related to vaccine development, availability, and access, 20% related to morbidity and mortality, 8% to safety, efficacy, and acceptance, and the rest were other categories. Of the 637 items, 5% (30/) were true, 83% (528/637) were false, 10% (66/637) were misleading, and 2% (13/637) were exaggerated.Rumors and conspiracy theories may lead to mistrust contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Tracking COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in real-time and engaging with social media to disseminate correct information could help safeguard the public against misinformation."
https://openalex.org/W3163074192,"Hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine remains high among the US population. Now that the vaccine is available to priority populations, it is critical to convince those that are hesitant to take the vaccine. Public health communication about the vaccine as well as misinformation on the vaccine occurs through a variety of different information channels. Some channels of information are more commonly found to spread misinformation. Given the expansive information environment, we sought to characterize the use of different media channels for COVID-19 vaccine information and determine the relationship between information channel and vaccine acceptance. We used quota sampling of vaccine priority groups [N = 2,650] between December 13 and 23, 2020 and conducted bivariate chi-squared tests and multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses to determine the relative impact of channels of information on vaccine acceptance. We found traditional channels of information, especially National TV, National newspapers, and local newspapers increased the likelihood of vaccine acceptance. Individuals who received information from traditional media compared to social media or both traditional and social media were most likely to accept the vaccine. The implications of this study suggest social media channels have a role to play in educating the hesitant to accept the vaccine, while traditional media channels should continue to promote data-driven and informed vaccine content to their viewers."
https://openalex.org/W3162457985,"The main strategy for combatting SARS-CoV-2 infections in 2020 consisted of behavioural regulations including contact reduction, maintaining distance, hand hygiene, and mask wearing. COVID-19-related risk perception and knowledge may influence protective behaviour, and education could be an important determinant. The current study investigated differences by education level in risk perception, knowledge and protective behaviour regarding COVID-19 in Germany, exploring the development of the pandemic over time. The COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring study is a repeated cross-sectional online survey conducted during the pandemic in Germany from 3 March 2020 (waves 1-28: 27,957 participants aged 18-74). Differences in risk perception, knowledge and protective behaviour according to education level (high versus low) were analysed using linear and logistic regression. Time trends were accounted for by interaction terms for education level and calendar week. Regarding protective behaviour, interaction terms were tested for all risk perception and knowledge variables with education level. The strongest associations with education level were evident for perceived and factual knowledge regarding COVID-19. Moreover, associations were found between low education level and higher perceived severity, and between low education level and lower perceived probability. Highly educated men were more worried about COVID-19 than those with low levels of education. No educational differences were observed for perceived susceptibility or fear. Higher compliance with hand washing was found in highly educated women, and higher compliance with maintaining distance was found in highly educated men. Regarding maintaining distance, the impact of perceived severity differed between education groups. In men, significant moderation effects of education level on the association between factual knowledge and all three protective behaviours were found. During the pandemic, risk perception and protective behaviour varied greatly over time. Overall, differences by education level were relatively small. For risk communication, reaching all population groups irrespective of education level is critical."
https://openalex.org/W3161438784,"Information is carried between brain regions through neurotransmitter release from axonal presynaptic terminals. Understanding the functional roles of defined neuronal projection pathways requires temporally precise manipulation of their activity. However, existing inhibitory optogenetic tools have low efficacy and off-target effects when applied to presynaptic terminals, while chemogenetic tools are difficult to control in space and time. Here, we show that a targeting-enhanced mosquito homolog of the vertebrate encephalopsin (eOPN3) can effectively suppress synaptic transmission through the Gi/o signaling pathway. Brief illumination of presynaptic terminals expressing eOPN3 triggers a lasting suppression of synaptic output that recovers spontaneously within minutes in vitro and in vivo. In freely moving mice, eOPN3-mediated suppression of dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents induces a reversible ipsiversive rotational bias. We conclude that eOPN3 can be used to selectively suppress neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals with high spatiotemporal precision, opening new avenues for functional interrogation of long-range neuronal circuits in vivo."

The development of molecular tools to monitor and control defined cell types has greatly accelerated our understanding of fundamental biological processes. Within the field of neuroscience, these tools have granted access to the circuit dynamics underlying complex behaviors. Recent approaches to manipulate neuronal activity have largely focused on optogenetic strategies using light-activated ion channels and pumps (Copits et al., 2016Copits B.A. Pullen M.Y.

The primary strength of optogenetic activators has been their spatiotemporal precision in controlling neuronal firing and, more importantly, their distinct projections at millisecond timescales. However, optogenetic inhibition using ion-based opsins at synaptic terminals has proven to be far more problematic. These challenges are largely due to biophysical limitations resulting in direct depolarization or rebound spiking (Mahn et al., 2016Mahn M. Prigge M. Ron S. Levy R. Yizhar O.

An alternative strategy for inhibiting synaptic projections with chemogenetic receptors took advantage of the natural ability of Gi-coupled GPCRs to inhibit synaptic transmission (Stachniak et al., 2014Stachniak T.J.

However, while powerful in many applications, these chemogenetic tools lack spatial and temporal precision compared to optical approaches. Engineered rhodopsin-GPCR (opto-XR) chimeras, in which light sensitivity is granted to different GPCRs by splicing them to the light-sensitive visual protein rhodopsin, bridge opto- and chemogenetic approaches to gain spatiotemporal control of physiological signaling cascades (Airan et al., 2009Airan R.D.

Optogenetic user’s guide to Opto-GPCRs.Front. Biosci. 2016; 21: 794-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, existing opto-XRs are limited by high photosensitivity and irreversible activation of the rhodopsin chromophore (Ernst et al., 2014Ernst O.P. Lodowski D.T. Elstner M. Hegemann P. Brown L.S. Kandori H. Microbial and animal rhodopsins: structures, functions, and molecular mechanisms.Chem. Rev. 2014; 114: 126-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Evolution has generated tremendous diversity in visual and non-visual opsins throughout the animal kingdom (Davies et al., 2010Davies W.L. Hankins M.W. Foster R.G.

We posited that these opsins may have evolved unique spectral and/or kinetic properties that could make them superior candidates to manipulate neural circuits. The ideal opto-GPCR would (1) be rapidly reversible, (2) exhibit moderate light sensitivity to avoid activation by ambient light, and (3) have spectral properties that overlap with existing optogenetic equipment. Additionally, opsin coupling to GPCR signaling cascades that have been evolutionarily co-opted to suppress neurotransmitter release would directly address a major limitation with currently available tools—inhibiting synaptic projections (Wiegert et al., 2017Wiegert J.S.

Silencing Neurons: Tools, Applications, and Experimental Constraints.Neuron. 2017; 95: 504-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We tested various opsins that might possess these features and identified lamprey parapinopsin (PPO) as a potential candidate (Eickelbeck et al., 2020Eickelbeck D. Rudack T. Tennigkeit S.A. Surdin T.

PPO is a non-visual G-protein-coupled opsin expressed in the lamprey pineal gland that can be photoswitched into on and off states when illuminated with ultraviolet (UV) versus green/amber light (Kawano-Yamashita et al., 2015Kawano-Yamashita E. Koyanagi M. Wada S. Tsukamoto H. Nagata T. Terakita A.

This bistable property is thought to confer color discrimination abilities in these ancient vertebrates to sense diurnal or seasonal changes (Dodt and Meissl, 1982Dodt E. Meissl H.

Spectral sensitivity and mechanism of interaction between inhibitory and excitatory responses of photosensory pineal neurons.Pflugers Arch. 1994; 427: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this feature might be harnessed for more precise manipulations of neuronal circuits. Here, we establish PPO as a photoswitchable GPCR-based opsin for rapid and reversible control of inhibitory G-protein pathways and synaptic terminal inhibition in vivo. PPO represents a unique GPCR-based tool for projection-specific presynaptic inhibition and for dissecting fundamental aspects of cellular biology and GPCR pharmacology. PPO is a GPCR-based opsin that interconverts between on and off states by absorption of UV and amber light, respectively (Figure 1A) (Koyanagi et al., 2004Koyanagi M. Kawano E. Kinugawa Y. Oishi T. Shichida Y. Tamotsu S. Terakita A. Bistable UV pigment in the lamprey pineal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PPO was shown to couple to mammalian Gi/o proteins (Eickelbeck et al., 2020Eickelbeck D. Rudack T. Tennigkeit S.A. Surdin T. Karapinar R. Schwitalla J.C. Mücher B. Shulman M. Scherlo M. Althoff P. et al.Lamprey parapinopsin (“UVLamP”): a bistable UV-sensitive optogenetic switch for ultrafast control of GPCR pathways.ChemBioChem. 2020; 21: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar; Kawano-Yamashita et al., 2015Kawano-Yamashita E.

Activation of transducin by bistable pigment parapinopsin in the pineal organ of lower vertebrates.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0141280Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); however, UV irradiation is a potential limiting factor for use in vivo. Recently, we used violet light to control cell migration with PPO in vitro (O’Neill et al., 2018O’Neill P.R. Castillo-Badillo J.A. Meshik X. Kalyanaraman V. Melgarejo K. Gautam N. Membrane Flow Drives an Adhesion-Independent Amoeboid Cell Migration Mode.Dev. Cell. 2018; 46: 9-22.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and hypothesized that PPO may be sensitive to even longer wavelengths and thus more suitable in vivo. We observed a tail in the blue wavelengths of the PPO absorption spectra (Figure 1B), leading us to ask whether blue light sources commonly used in optogenetic experiments (Copits et al., 2016Copits B.A. Pullen M.Y. Gereau 4th, R.W.

Bruchas M.R. Optogenetic approaches for dissecting neuromodulation and GPCR signaling in neural circuits.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2017; 32: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) can activate PPO. We confirmed that purified PPO absorbs non-UV light (Figure S1A) and that blue LED stimulation inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP (Figures 1C and S1B). To more precisely define the spectral and temporal properties of PPO signaling in vitro, we used imaging assays of G-protein translocation to monitor engagement of downstream Gβγ subunits (Ajith Karunarathne et al., 2012Ajith Karunarathne W.K. O’Neill P.R. Martinez-Espinosa P.L. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. All G protein βγ complexes are capable of translocation on receptor activation.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

G-protein signaling leverages subunit-dependent membrane affinity to differentially control βγ translocation to intracellular membranes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E3568-E3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We co-expressed PPO with fluorescently tagged γ9 subunits in HeLa cells and quantified γ9 fluorescence changes from the plasma membrane (PM). PPO was well expressed on the PM of both HeLa cells (Figure 1D) and striatal neurons (Figure S1C). Imaging of mCherry-tagged γ9 with a 595-nm laser did not affect PM localization (red arrows, Figure 1D), consistent with the action spectra of PPO in the off state (Figure 1B). Widefield illumination with low-intensity UV light (365 nm, 0.03 mW/mm2) produced rapid intracellular translocation of γ9-mCherry from the PM (Figures 1D and 1E; Video S1). Photoactivation with blue light of the same intensity caused minimal translocation; however, at 15 mW/mm2, we observed equivalent translocation compared to UV illumination (Figures 1D and 1E). To examine the photoswitching properties of PPO, we imaged GFP-tagged γ9 subunits with a 488-nm blue laser (45 μW power through the spinning disk, typical for GFP imaging), which activated PPO and decreased the PM localization of GFP-γ9 (Figures 1F and 1G). Simultaneous illumination with an amber LED (595 nm, 150 μW) rapidly reversed GFP-γ9 back to the PM even while photostimulating PPO. We could repeatedly photoswitch PPO on and off without any apparent desensitization (Figure 1G). Together, these data indicate that UV-sensitive PPO can also be activated by blue light and turned off with amber light. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/722bc538-2545-4ee6-af42-8191a9e355e8/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

PPO is activated by both UV and blue light, related to Figure 1Video of γ9-mCherry translocation in HeLa cells co-expressing untagged parapinopsin (PPO). γ9-mCherry (red) was imaged with a 595-nm laser, which did not cause spontaneous translocation. Widefield stimulation with blue (470 nm) and UV (365 nm) light (150 ms pulses every 5 s) was delivered when indicated. Note the rapid translocation of γ9-mCherry from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments during photostimulation and recovery when the light is switched off. The lack of spontaneous γ9 translocation while imaging and the ability to photoswitch PPO into the off state suggested that PPO could be used in parallel with red fluorescent proteins or sensors. We imaged γ9-mCherry and then illuminated individual cells with blue light. We observed rapid translocation of γ9-mCherry in stimulated regions without affecting adjacent cells (Figures 1H and 1I; Video S2). We could also achieve subcellular resolution of G-protein activation (Figures S1D and S1E), indicating that PPO may be a useful tool for probing the subcellular dynamics of GPCR signaling (Eichel and von Zastrow, 2018Eichel K. von Zastrow M.

PPO can be activated at single-cell resolution, related to Figure 1Video of γ9-mCherry (red) translocation in HeLa cells co-expressing untagged parapinopsin (PPO). LED stimulation of individual cells in the boxed regions of interest was delivered through a digital mirror device. Note the rapid translocation in the regions of interest, which did not affect translocation in adjacent cells. We next determined whether this GPCR-based opsin can be combined with multiphoton imaging. We imaged γ9-mScarlet at 1,080 nm while photostimulating at different infrared wavelengths with a second tunable laser. We observed maximal G-protein activation around 700 nm, which decreased at longer wavelengths tested up to 1,000 nm (Figures 1J and S1F). While PPO may have utility in multiphoton optogenetics, care must be taken when combined with imaging particular fluorophores at these wavelengths to avoid unintended activation. We next tested whether PPO engages downstream effectors like G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels, which was recently demonstrated with UV/violet light (Eickelbeck et al., 2020Eickelbeck D.

We co-expressed PPO-Venus with GIRK2A channels in HEK cells and recorded whole-cell currents (Figure 2B). Both blue and UV light (10 mW/mm2) produced equivalent activation of GIRK currents (Figures 2B and 2C). Surprisingly, even very-low-intensity blue light could achieve ∼60% of the maximal activation seen with UV light (Figure 2C). We observed no evidence of tonic activity (Figures S2A and S2B) and limited activation by ambient room lighting (Figure S2C) but continued to minimize light exposure. We next tested the kinetics of PPO coupling to GIRK channels. 100 ms flashes of UV or blue light (both 10 mW/mm2) rapidly activated GIRK currents, with UV light activating PPO more rapidly (Figures 2D, 2E, and S2D) but with similar peak amplitudes (Figure S2E). The off rates after UV illumination exhibited the most striking difference however, with a much longer decay and large steady-state currents that were switched off with amber light (Figures 2F–2H and S2F). A single UV pulse caused GIRK activation with a Taudecay of 5 min and a persistent current for >10 min (Figure 2I). Because of the need for a second wavelength to photoswitch PPO off, we next tested whether sustained activation could be achieved using agonist pulses of blue light. Interestingly, repeated 100-ms pulses at 1 Hz slightly slowed activation, likely due to simultaneous activation and deactivation of receptors (Figures 2J and 2K). In contrast, shorter pulses (10 ms, 10 Hz) activated GIRK channels more rapidly, with no difference in latency, peak amplitude, or desensitization (Figures 2J–2M and S2G), suggesting that pulsed blue light could be used for persistent activation of PPO while retaining rapid off kinetics. We next determined whether PPO can be used for neuronal inhibition, akin to chemogenetic Gi-coupled DREADDs (Roth, 2016Roth B.L. DREADDs for Neuroscientists.Neuron. 2016; 89: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). To test this, we created a Cre-dependent AAV construct (AAV5:Ef1α:DIO:PPO-Venus) and injected viruses into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of DAT-Cre mice to target midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons (Figure 3B). We observed strong expression of PPO-Venus in DA neurons of the VTA (Figures 3C and 3D) and recorded from these neurons to determine whether PPO couples to native GIRK channels to decrease excitability. Pulsed blue LED light produced outward currents, consistent with GIRK channel activation at −60 mV (Figure 3E). Photoactivation of PPO strongly inhibited these neurons (Figures 3F–3H), increased rheobase, decreased input resistance, and reduced firing, which were all fully reversed with bath application of the GIRK channel blocker Ba2+ (Figures 3I–3L). Inwardly rectifying currents were similarly activated by blue light and blocked by Ba2+ (Figure 3M). These results indicate that PPO can be used for photoactivation of Gi-coupled signaling cascades in neurons with blue light, consistent with a recent report using violet light (Rodgers et al., 2021Rodgers J. Bano-Otalora B. Belle M.D.C. Paul S. Hughes R. Wright P. McDowell R. Milosavljevic N. Orlowska-Feuer P.

We next assessed whether PPO could suppress reward-seeking behaviors mediated by VTA DA neurons in vivo (Morales and Margolis, 2017Morales M. Margolis E.B.

We bilaterally injected Cre-dependent AAVs into DAT-Cre mice (Bäckman et al., 2006Bäckman C.M. Malik N. Zhang Y. Shan L. Grinberg A. Hoffer B.J. Westphal H. Tomac A.C.

We observed PPO expression throughout VTA cell bodies and along neuronal processes (Figures 3O and S3A). Reward-seeking behavior was tested in mice trained to perform operant tasks for a sucrose reward (Figures 3P–3R). Food-restricted mice underwent Pavlovian conditioning to associate a light cue with access to a sucrose sipper (Figure 3Q) and were trained on fixed ratio (FR) schedules to nose poke for sucrose rewards (Figure 3R). We then assessed reward-seeking behavior in FR-3 tests. 10 Hz laser light significantly suppressed the number of both nose pokes and rewards (Figure 3S). These data indicate reduced reward-seeking behavior when VTA DA neuron cell bodies were inhibited by PPO, consistent with other inhibitory approaches (Corre et al., 2018Corre J. van Zessen R.

The spatiotemporal control of Gi signaling suggested that PPO could also have applications as an optogenetic inhibitory tool at synaptic terminals, akin to the well-established role of presynaptic inhibitory GPCRs. To test this, we determined whether PPO inhibits neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) currents (Figure 4A). We transduced cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from AvilCre mice (da Silva et al., 2011da Silva S. Hasegawa H. Scott A. Zhou X. Wagner A.K. Han B.-X. Wang F.

Thus, visual transthalamic pathways are functionally specific to their cortical target, different from feedforward cortical pathways, and combine information from multiple brain regions, linking sensory signals with behavioral context. Our perception of the environment is thought to rely on neuronal interactions within the cerebral cortex, where sensory information is processed by hierarchical pathways involving many cortical areas (Van Essen, 1979Van Essen D.C. Visual areas of the mammalian cerebral cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1979; 2: 227-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, all cortical areas are also highly interconnected with the thalamus, from which the cortex receives the majority of its input. First-order thalamic nuclei convey information from the sense organs to primary sensory areas in the neocortex and have been extensively characterized (Guillery and Sherman, 2002Guillery R.W.

The Thalamus. Springer, 1985Crossref Google Scholar). However, the larger part of the sensory thalamus consists of so-called higher-order nuclei, which form extensive and intricate circuits with cortical areas (Guillery and Sherman, 2002Guillery R.W.

The higher-order thalamic nucleus of the visual system is the pulvinar complex, also known as the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) in rodents (Baldwin et al., 2017Baldwin M.K.L. Balaram P. Kaas J.H.

Pulvinar projections to primary visual cortex (V1) target mostly cortical layers 1 and 5a and have been shown to convey contextual information (Roth et al., 2016Roth M.M. Dahmen J.C. Muir D.R.

However, the pulvinar provides more pronounced input to higher visual areas, where it also targets the cortical input layer 4 and can strongly impact cortical activity (Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019Beltramo R.

The pulvinar receives most of its input from visual brain areas. While some of its subdivisions are innervated by the superior colliculus, the main input to large parts of the pulvinar comes from visual areas in the neocortex (Baldwin et al., 2017Baldwin M.K.L.

The mouse pulvinar nucleus: organization of the tectorecipient zones.Vis. Neurosci. 2017; 34: E011Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, this higher-order thalamic complex has been proposed to form transthalamic pathways, whereby layer 5 cortical cells of a lower-order area drive thalamocortical cells that project to a higher-order cortical area (Sherman, 2016Sherman S.M. Thalamus plays a central role in ongoing cortical functioning.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar; Sherman and Guillery, 2011Sherman S.M. Guillery R.W. Distinct functions for direct and transthalamic corticocortical connections.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These indirect feedforward pathways via the thalamus would parallel direct intracortical feedforward connections, for instance from V1 to a higher visual area. While anatomical projection patterns are compatible with this hypothesis (Bennett et al., 2019Bennett C. Gale S.D. Garrett M.E. Newton M.L. Callaway E.M. Murphy G.J. Olsen S.R.

Sci. 2003; 358: 1605-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the fine-scale input and output connectivity of pulvinar neurons has not been determined. It is therefore still unresolved if they are part of transthalamic feedforward pathways between cortical areas. Alternatively, pulvinar circuits could provide additional visual pathways from the retina to the cortex via the superior colliculus or form specific, reciprocal loops with individual cortical areas (Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019Beltramo R.

Sci. 2011; 15: 177-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is unclear what information these pathways through the pulvinar bring to cortical visual areas and how the signals they convey differ from those carried by direct intracortical projections. To address these questions, we focused on higher-order thalamic circuits of the mouse visual system. More than a dozen higher visual areas have been described in the mouse neocortex (Wang and Burkhalter, 2007Wang Q. Burkhalter A. Area map of mouse visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 502: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar; Zhuang et al., 2017Zhuang J. Ng L. Williams D. Valley M. Li Y. Garrett M. Waters J. An extended retinotopic map of mouse cortex.eLife. 2017; 6: e18372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), including the anterolateral (AL) area and the posteromedial (PM) area. The visual response properties of AL and PM are different from V1 and distinct from each other. The function of these visual areas is still unclear, but AL may be specialized to process visual motion, as neurons in AL preferentially respond to moving stimuli of low spatial and high temporal frequency, while PM neurons on average prefer high spatial and low temporal frequency stimuli (Andermann et al., 2011Andermann M.L.

Burkhalter A. Area map of mouse visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 502: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we found that the population of LP neurons projecting to either of these cortical areas combines information from V1 layer 5 cells with signals from many other cortical and subcortical areas, including superior colliculus. Optogenetic silencing of different cortical areas confirmed that LP neurons projecting to higher visual areas are strongly influenced by V1 activity but also receive significant input from the area they are projecting to. Two-photon calcium imaging of axonal boutons revealed that LP sends specific signals to higher visual areas that differ from those carried by the direct cortical feedforward pathway from V1. In behaving animals, direct projections from V1 to cortical area AL carry information about visual motion in the environment, while LP input to AL combines information about visual motion and the animals’ own movement. In summary, our results indicate that LP is a key node of feedforward transthalamic pathways that convey information distinct from V1 intracortical feedforward projections and may link sensory signals with the behavioral context in which they are encountered. LP is interconnected with all visual areas. However, the sources of inputs to LP neurons projecting to a specific higher visual area are unknown. LP could potentially form strong reciprocal loops with the cortex, whereby thalamic neurons receive most of their input from their cortical target area (Guo et al., 2017Guo Z.V. Inagaki H.K. Daie K.

Alternatively, LP could be part of transthalamic pathways whereby thalamic neurons projecting to a higher visual area receive their inputs from other structures, such as V1 or the superior colliculus (Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019Beltramo R.

We found that LP neurons projecting to AL received synaptic input from a large number of brain areas (Figures 1B–1H, S1H, S1I, S1K, and S1L), resembling the general pattern of inputs to LP (Figures S2E–S2I; Bennett et al., 2019Bennett C.

Presynaptic neurons were also located in the ipsilateral superior colliculus (Figures 1E and 1F) as well as in cortical association areas, in particular the retrosplenial cortex and anterior cingulate and secondary motor cortices (Figure 1D, S1H, S1I, and S1K). Notably, LP neurons received input from several areas containing mainly inhibitory neurons, including the thalamic reticular nucleus, the zona incerta, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, and the anterior pretectal nucleus (Figures 1G and 1H, Halassa and Acsády, 2016Halassa M.M.

To determine if this brain-wide pattern of input connectivity is specific to AL-projecting LP neurons or a general feature of LP thalamocortical pathways, we investigated the connectivity of LP neurons projecting to a different visual cortical area, PM. First, to test if LP projections to AL and PM originate from distinct populations of neurons, we injected differently colored retrograde tracers into the two cortical areas (Figure S3). In agreement with a previous study (Juavinett et al., 2020Juavinett A.L. Kim E.J. Collins H.C. Callaway E.M. A systematic topographical relationship between mouse lateral posterior thalamic neurons and their visual cortical projection targets.J. Comp. Neurol. 2020; 528: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we found that only a small subset of LP neurons was double labeled (7.8%; Figure S3F), indicating that the projections from LP to AL and PM are largely distinct. We then determined the sources of presynaptic input to PM-projecting LP neurons, employing projection-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing as described above (Figure S1J). PM-projecting LP neurons had a distribution of presynaptic inputs that was largely similar to that of AL-projecting neurons (Figures 1D, 1F, 1H, S1K, and S1L), suggesting that the pattern of inputs to LP thalamocortical pathways generalize across higher visual target areas. Notably, PM- and AL-projecting neurons had comparable fractions of presynaptic cells in AL and PM (Figure 2A and 2B), suggesting that LP neurons do not preferentially receive reciprocal input from their cortical target area. Slight differences in the distribution of inputs to PM- and AL-projecting neurons were, however, apparent; PM-projecting neurons tended to be innervated to a larger extent by nonvisual cortical areas (Figures 1D and S1K) and deeper layers of SC (Figure 1F). Cortical efferents have been described to differentially affect their target neurons, depending on the cortical layer they originate from. The main driving input onto thalamic neurons from the cortex is thought to arise from layer 5 cells, while layer 6 cells are assumed to provide weaker or modulatory feedback (Crick and Koch, 1998Crick F.

Distinct functions for direct and transthalamic corticocortical connections.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To determine the cortical origin of putative driving and modulatory inputs onto AL- and PM-projecting LP neurons, we quantified the number of presynaptic cells in each layer of visual cortical areas (Figures 2C–2E). We found that presynaptic layer 5 cells were not predominantly located in the cortical target area of either AL- or PM- projecting LP neurons but were by far most numerous in V1. In contrast, the density of presynaptic layer 6a cells was much higher in higher visual areas than in V1. Presynaptic layer 6b cells showed a distribution similar to layer 5 inputs to LP and may therefore represent a cell class distinct from layer 6a (Hoerder-Suabedissen et al., 2018Hoerder-Suabedissen A. Hayashi S. Upton L. Nolan Z. Casas-Torremocha D. Grant E. Viswanathan S. Kanold P.O. Clasca F. Kim Y. Molnár Z. Subset of cortical layer 6b neurons selectively innervates higher order thalamic nuclei in mice.Cereb. Cortex. 2018; 28: 1882-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that LP pathways appear to have a strong feedforward component, whereby LP neurons integrate driving inputs from V1 layer 5 cells with information from many other cortical and subcortical areas. Monosynaptic retrograde rabies tracing can provide an indication of anatomical connectivity, but this method does not determine the functional influence of presynaptic inputs on target neurons. To test how different cortical areas affect activity in LP projection pathways, we optogenetically suppressed activity in these areas in vivo by activating the depolarizing opsin Chrimson (Klapoetke et al., 2014Klapoetke N.C. Murata Y. Kim S.S. Pulver S.R. Birdsey-Benson A. Cho Y.K. Morimoto T.K. Chuong A.S. Carpenter E.J. Tian Z. et al.Independent optical excitation of distinct neural populations.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection, in parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Figures 3 and S4A–S4C). Previous studies have shown that silencing V1 strongly suppresses activity in the frontal subregions of LP (Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019Beltramo R. Scanziani M. A collicular visual cortex: Neocortical space for an ancient midbrain visual structure.Science. 2019; 363: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; Bennett et al., 2019Bennett C. Gale S.D.

Higher-order thalamic circuits channel parallel streams of visual information in mice.Neuron. 2019; 102: 477-492.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To confirm that this holds true for LP neurons projecting to higher visual area AL, we suppressed activity in V1 while simultaneously imaging visual responses of LP boutons in AL (Figures 3A–3E). Silencing V1 strongly decreased visually evoked activity in a large fraction of LP boutons in AL (61.8% ± 30.6% of suppressed boutons per session and 32.9% ± 23.0% decrease in average response amplitude per session [median ± interquartile range]), confirming that V1 activity has a strong influence on LP neurons projecting to higher visual area AL. To test the functional importance of reciprocal loops in visual thalamocortical circuits, we next silenced AL while imaging LP boutons in AL (Figures 3F–3J and S4D–S4G). Optogenetic silencing of AL also had a surprisingly strong suppressive effect on LP bouton activity (39.4% ± 28.6% of suppressed boutons in each session and 21.5% ± 22.4% decrease in average response amplitude per session). This decrease in activity was not observed in control animals without opsin expression (Figures S4H–S4J). Therefore, AL provides significant input onto LP neurons projecting back to this cortical area. We repeated the same experiment for LP-PM thalamocortical circuits and silenced cortical visual area PM while imaging activity of LP boutons in PM (Figures 3K–3O). Silencing PM had a smaller but significant effect on visually evoked activity (8.7% ± 11.6% decrease in average response amplitude per session). However, LP boutons that were significantly affected (14.4% ± 17.8% of boutons per session; Figure 3O) were strongly inhibited (46.8% ± 21.1% decrease in response amplitude; Figure 3L left example), indicating that a subset of LP neurons was strongly modulated by the activity in their target area. Together, these results indicate that transthalamic pathways integrate signals from V1 with information from higher visual areas. The above results indicate that LP neurons projecting to higher visual areas receive prominent feedforward input from V1. These feedforward transthalamic pathways parallel the direct feedforward intracortical projections from V1 to higher visual areas. However, it is unknown if intracortical and transthalamic pathways are functionally distinct or convey similar information to a cortical target area. To address this question, we used in vivo two-photon microscopy in awake, head-fixed mice and imaged calcium signals of axonal projections from either LP or V1 expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B.

The present research aims to identify psychological characteristics that relate to adolescents’ well-being in terms of positive emotion and intrinsic learning motivation, and key characteristics of their learning behavior in a situation of unplanned, involuntary distance education. Following Self-Determination Theory, experienced competence, autonomy, and relatedness were assumed to relate to active learning behavior (i.e., engagement and persistence), and negatively relate to passive learning behavior (i.e., procrastination), mediated via positive emotion and intrinsic learning motivation. Data were collected via online questionnaires in altogether eight countries from Europe, Asia, and North America (N = 25,305) and comparable results across countries were expected. Experienced competence was consistently found to relate to positive emotion and intrinsic learning motivation, and, in turn, active learning behavior in terms of engagement and persistence. The study results further highlight the role of perceived relatedness for positive emotion. The high proportions of explained variance speak in favor of taking these central results into account when designing distance education in times of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3163855067,"Research funding is an important factor for public science. Funding may affect which research topics get addressed, and what research outputs are produced. However, funding has often been studied simplistically, using top-down or system-led perspectives. Such approaches often restrict analysis to confined national funding landscapes or single funding organizations and instruments in isolation. This overlooks interlinkages, broader funding researchers might access, and trends of growing funding complexity. This paper instead frames a 'bottom-up' approach that analytically distinguishes between increasing levels of aggregation of funding instrument co-use. Funding of research outputs is selected as one way to test this approach, with levels traced via funding acknowledgements (FAs) in papers published 2009-18 by researchers affiliated to Denmark, the Netherlands or Norway, in two test research fields (Food Science, Renewable Energy Research). Three funding aggregation levels are delineated: at the bottom, 'funding configurations' of funding instruments co-used by individual researchers (from single-authored papers with two or more FAs); a middle, 'funding amalgamations' level, of instruments co-used by collaborating researchers (from multi-authored papers with two or more FAs); and a 'co-funding network' of instruments co-used across all researchers active in a research field (all papers with two or more FAs). All three levels are found to include heterogenous funding co-use from inside and outside the test countries. There is also co-funding variety in terms of instrument 'type' (public, private, university or non-profit) and 'origin' (domestic, foreign or supranational). Limitations of the approach are noted, as well as its applicability for future analyses not using paper FAs to address finer details of research funding dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3160547704,"Mind wandering is often characterized by attention oriented away from an external task towards our internal, self-generated thoughts. This universal phenomenon has been linked to numerous disruptive functional outcomes, including performance errors and negative affect. Despite its prevalence and impact, studies to date have yet to identify robust behavioral signatures, making unobtrusive, yet reliable detection of mind wandering a difficult but important task for future applications. Here we examined whether electrophysiological measures can be used in machine learning models to accurately predict mind wandering states. We recorded scalp EEG from participants as they performed an auditory target detection task and self-reported whether they were on task or mind wandering. We successfully classified attention states both within (person-dependent) and across (person-independent) individuals using event-related potential (ERP) measures. Non-linear and linear machine learning models detected mind wandering above-chance within subjects: support vector machine (AUC = 0.715) and logistic regression (AUC = 0.635). Importantly, these models also generalized across subjects: support vector machine (AUC = 0.613) and logistic regression (AUC = 0.609), suggesting we can reliably predict a given individual's attention state based on ERP patterns observed in the group. This study is the first to demonstrate that machine learning models can generalize to ""never-seen-before"" individuals using electrophysiological measures, highlighting their potential for real-time prediction of covert attention states."
https://openalex.org/W3161600270,"Age assessment has attracted increasing attention in the field of forensics. However, most existing works are laborious and requires domain-specific knowledge. Modern computing power makes it is possible to leverage massive amounts of data to produce more reliable results. Therefore, it is logical to use automated age estimation approaches to handle large datasets. In this study, a fully automated age prediction approach was proposed by assessing 3D mandible and femur scans using deep learning. A total of 814 post-mortem computed tomography scans from 619 men and 195 women, within the age range of 20–70, were collected from the National Forensic Service in South Korea. Multiple preprocessing steps were applied for each scan to normalize the image and perform intensity correction to create 3D voxels that represent these parts accurately. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation. The initial cross-validation results illustrated the potential of the proposed method as it achieved a mean absolute error of 5.15 years with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.80. The proposed approach is likely to be faster and potentially more reliable, which could be used for age assessment in the future."

This study explores the clinical profiles and factors associated with COVID-19 in Cameroon. Materials and methods In this prospective cohort study, we followed patients admitted for suspicion of COVID-19 at Djoungolo Hospital between 01 st April and 31 st July 2020. Patients were categorised by age groups and disease severity: mild (symptomatic without clinical signs of pneumonia), moderate (with clinical signs of pneumonia without respiratory distress) and severe cases (clinical signs of pneumonia and respiratory distress not requiring invasive ventilation). Demographic information and clinical features were summarised. Multivariable analysis was performed to predict risk. Findings A total of 313 patients were admitted during the study period; 259 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Among the confirmed cases, the male group aged 40 to 49 years (13.9%) was predominant. Disease severity ranged from mild (26.2%; n = 68) to moderate (59%; n = 153) to severe (14.7%; n = 38); the case fatality rate was 1% (n = 4). Dysgusia (46%; n = 119) and hyposmia/anosmia (37.8%; n = 98) were common features of COVID-19. Nearly one-third of patients had comorbidities (29%; n = 53), of which hypertension was the most common (18.9%; n = 49). Participation in mass gatherings (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.37; P = 0.03) and dysgusia (OR = 2.09, P = 0.02) were predictive of diagnosis of COVID-19. Age groups 60 to 69 (OR = 7.41; P = 0.0001), 50 to 59 (OR = 4.09; P = 0.03), 40 to 49 (OR = 4.54; P = 0.01), male gender (OR = 2.53; P = 0.04), diabetes (OR = 4.05; P = 0.01), HIV infection (OR = 5.57; P = 0.03), lung disease (OR = 6.29; P = 0.01), dyspnoea (OR = 3.70; P = 0.008) and fatigue (OR = 3.35; P = 0.02) significantly predicted COVID-19 severity. Conclusions Most COVID-19 cases in this study were benign with low fatality. Age (40–70), male gender, HIV infection, lung disease, dyspnoea and fatigue are associated with severe COVID-19. Such findings may guide public health decision-making."

Imprudent and over antimicrobial use (AMU) aggravates antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antimicrobials are massively used in animal production as compared with AMU in human health sectors. This research was done with the objective of assessing the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) status of animal producers towards AMU and AMR. A Cross-sectional study design and questionnaire were conducted and both qualitative and quantitative data analyses were used. The logistic regression was used to test the effect of each predictor variable on the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the participants. Out of 571 animal producers, the majority (80.2%) of them were not knowledgeable and 85.3% of the animal producers had a negative attitude towards the AMU and AMR. Likewise, the practice of 78.5% of the animal producers were practice improperly towards AMU and AMR. All the questions that were designed to assess the KAP of the animal producers were significantly associated (P&lt;0.05) with each respective category of KAP. The educational status of animal producers was negatively correlated (OR = 0.38) with all their knowledge, attitude, and practice of AMU and AMR, but sex has a positive correlation (OR = 2.89) with both the knowledge and practice of animal producers. In conclusion, the animal producers in the Oromia zone had unsatisfactory knowledge regarding AMU and AMR. The animal producer’s attitude and their practices were negative and improper respectively. As a result, consecutive awareness creation on both AMU and AMR is recommended and integrated AMU governance in animal production is recommended to be applied."
https://openalex.org/W3163494112,"Opioid prescribing data can guide regulation policy by informing trends and types of opioids prescribed and geographic variations. In South Korea, the nationwide data on prescribing opioids remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate an 11-year trend of opioid prescription in South Korea, both nationally and by administrative districts. A population-based cross-sectional analysis of opioid prescriptions dispensed nationwide in outpatient departments between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2019, was conducted for this study. Data were obtained from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service. The types of opioids prescribed were categorized into total, strong, and extended-release and long-acting formulation. Trends in the prescription rate per 1000 persons were examined over time nationally and across administrative districts. There are significant increasing trends for total, strong, and extended-release and long-acting opioid prescriptions (rate per 1000 persons in 2009 and 2019: total opioids, 347.5 and 531.3; strong opioids, 0.6 and 15.2; extended-release and long-acting opioids, 6.8 and 82.0). The pattern of dispensing opioids increased from 2009 to 2013 and slowed down from 2013 to 2019. The rate of opioid prescriptions issued between administrative districts nearly doubled for all types of opioids. Prescription opioid dispensing increased substantially over the study period. The increase in the prescription of total opioids was largely attributed to an increase in the prescription of weak opioids. However, the increase in prescriptions of extended-release and long-acting opioids could be a future concern. These data may inform government organizations to create regulations and interventions for prescribing opioids."

https://openalex.org/W3161424399,"Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and auditory middle-latency responses (AMLRs) to a click stimulus were measured in about 100 subjects. Of interest were the sex differences in those auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), the correlations between the various AEP measures, and the correlations between the AEP measures and measures of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and behavioral performance also measured on the same subjects. Also of interest was how the menstrual cycle affected the various AEP measures. Most ABR measures and several AMLR measures exhibited sex differences, and many of the former were substantial. The sex differences tended to be larger for latency than for amplitude of the waves, and they tended to be larger for a weak click stimulus than for a strong click. The largest sex difference was for Wave-V latency (effect size ~1.2). When subjects were dichotomized into Non-Whites and Whites, the race differences in AEPs were small within sex. However, sex and race interacted so that the sex differences often were larger for the White subjects than for the Non-White subjects, particularly for the latency measures. Contrary to the literature, no AEP measures differed markedly across the menstrual cycle. Correlations between various AEP measures, and between AEP and OAE measures, were small and showed no consistent patterns across sex or race categories. Performance on seven common psychoacoustical tasks was only weakly correlated with individual AEP measures (just as was true for the OAEs also measured on these subjects). AMLR Wave Pa unexpectedly did not show the decrease in latency and increase in amplitude typically observed for AEPs when click level was varied from 40 to 70 dB nHL (normal Hearing Level). For the majority of the measures, the variability of the distribution of scores was greater for the males than for the females."
https://openalex.org/W3161757055,"Introduction SARS-CoV-2 transmission within schools and its contribution to community transmission are still a matter of debate. Methods A retrospective cohort study in all public schools in Catalonia was conducted using publicly available data assessing the association between the number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases among students and staff in weeks 1–2 (Sept 14-27th, 2020) of the academic year with school SARS-CoV-2 incidence among students in weeks 4–5. A multilevel Poisson regression model adjusted for the community incidence in the corresponding basic health area (BHA) and the type of school (primary or secondary), with random effects at the sanitary region and BHA levels, was performed. Results A total of 2184 public schools opened on September 14th with 778,715 students. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in a centre in weeks 1–2 and the SARS-CoV-2 school incidence among students in weeks 4–5 (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.074, 95% CI 1.044–1.105, p-value &lt;0.001). The adjusted BHA incidence in the first two weeks was associated with school incidence in weeks 4–5 (RR 1.002, 95% CI 1.002–1.003, p-value &lt;0.001). Secondary schools showed an increased incidence in weeks 4 and 5 (RR primary vs secondary 1.709 95% CI 1.599–1.897, p-value &lt;0.001). Conclusions Safety measures adopted by schools were not enough to stop related-to-school transmission in students and could be improved. The safest way to keep schools open is to reduce community transmission down to a minimum."
https://openalex.org/W3080164307,"Asexuality is defined as a unique sexual orientation characterized by a lack of sexual attraction to others. This has been challenged, with some experts positing that it is better explained as a sexual dysfunction. Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD) is characterized by absent/reduced sexual interest/arousal paired with personal distress, with two subtypes: acquired and lifelong. Research suggests that while asexuality and acquired SIAD are distinct entities, there may be overlap between asexuality and lifelong SIAD. Findings from studies using eye-tracking and implicit association tasks suggest that these methodologies might differentiate these groups on the basis of their neural mechanisms. However, no study has compared their cognitive processing of sexual cues, and the literature on lifelong SIAD is minimal. The current study tested differences in the cognitive processing of sexual cues between asexual individuals and women with SIAD (lifelong and acquired). Forty-two asexual individuals and 25 heterosexual women with SIAD (16: acquired; 9: lifelong) completed three study components: a visual attention task, a Single Category-Implicit Association Task, and the sex semantic differential. ANOVAs examined group differences in: 1) visual attention to erotic cues, 2) implicit appraisals of sexual words, and 3) explicit appraisals of sex. Women with SIAD displayed a controlled attention preference for erotic images and areas of sexual contact, with longer dwell times to these areas relative to asexual individuals, who did not gaze preferentially at erotic cues. For implicit appraisals, all groups demonstrated negative-neutral implicit associations with sexual words. For explicit appraisals, women with acquired SIAD reported more positive evaluations of sex relative to asexual individuals and women with lifelong SIAD. This project sheds light on key differences between asexuality and low desire, and has implications for best clinical practice guidelines for the assessment of lifelong SIAD."
https://openalex.org/W3160370673,"In many kinds of sports, deceptive actions are frequently used to hamper the anticipation of an opponent. The head fake in basketball is often applied to deceive an observer regarding the direction of a pass. To perform a head fake, a basketball player turns the head in one direction, but passes the ball to the opposite direction. Several studies showed that reactions to passes with head fakes are slower and more error-prone than to passes without head fakes (head-fake effect). The aim of a basketball player is to produce a head-fake effect for as large as possible in the opponent. The question if the timing of the deceptive action influences the size of the head-fake effect has not yet been examined systematically. The present study investigated if the head-fake effect depends on the temporal lag between the head turn and the passing movement. To this end, the stimulus onset asynchrony between head turn, and pass was varied between 0 and 800 ms. The results showed the largest effect when the head turn precedes the pass by 300 ms. This result can be explained better by facilitating the processing of passes without head fake than by making it more difficult to process passes with a head fake. This result is discussed regarding practical implications and conclusions about the underlying mechanism of the head-fake effect in basketball are drawn."

Various studies have shown the direct impact of different flow rates on bacteria biofilm formation, mass transfer and resulting different corrosion behaviour of materials in neutral environments. However, little is understood on corrosion under acidic flow conditions. This study investigated the impact of an acidic artificial seawater environment containing Desulfovibrio vulgaris on DSS 2205 microbial corrosion under different velocities (0.25 m.s-1 and 0.61 m.s-1). Experiments containing no bacteria were performed as controls. Bacterial attachment was observed by optical and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Materials corrosion was assessed using open circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization. Pits formed after potentiodynamic test were observed under SEM. The largest area of bacterial attachment was found on coupons immersed at a velocity of 0.25 m.s-1; however, the corrosion rate was lower than at higher velocity. Shallow pits occurred in the metal coupons when bacteria were present, while deep pits occurred in the controls. The study indicates the positive impact of biofilm formation in corrosion prevention of materials under acidic condition. The nature of corrosion behaviour of duplex stainless is discussed."

Fecundability decreased from 12 months for EFI 0-4 and from 24 months for EFI 5-10.Our analysis suggests that patients with an unfavorable EFI (≤4) have more ART pregnancies than patients with a favorable EFI (≥5) and should be referred for ART shortly after surgery. Patients with a favorable EFI may attempt spontaneous pregnancy for 24 months before referral."

Based on a long-term field study in an urban trauma center that involved observation-, interview-, and survey-based studies to understand our target users and their working environment, we designed and implemented MediSenseView as a working prototype. MediSenseView is a clinical-data interface system, which was developed through the identification of three core challenges of existing interface system use in a trauma care unit-device separation, usage inefficiency, and system immobility-from the perspectives of three staff groups in our target environment (i.e., doctors, clinical nurses and research nurses), and through an iterative design study. The results from our pilot deployment of MediSenseView and a user study performed with 28 trauma center staff members highlight their work efficiency and satisfaction with MediSenseView compared to existing clinical data interface systems in the hospital."
https://openalex.org/W3163611293,"Hearing depends on the transduction of sounds into neural signals by the inner hair cells of the cochlea. Cochleae also have outer hair cells with unique electromotile properties that increase auditory sensitivity, but they are particularly susceptible to damage by intense noise exposure, ototoxic drugs, and aging. Although the outer hair cells have synapses on afferent neurons that project to the brain, the function of this neuronal circuit is unclear. Here, we created a novel mouse allele that inserts a fluorescent reporter at the C1ql1 locus which revealed gene expression in the outer hair cells and allowed creation of outer hair cell-specific C1ql1 knockout mice. We found that C1ql1 expression in outer hair cells corresponds to areas with the most sensitive frequencies of the mouse audiogram, and that it has an unexpected adolescence-onset developmental timing. No expression was observed in the inner hair cells. Since C1QL1 in the brain is made by neurons, transported anterogradely in axons, and functions in the synaptic cleft, C1QL1 may serve a similar function at the outer hair cell afferent synapse. Histological analyses revealed that C1ql1 conditional knockout cochleae may have reduced outer hair cell afferent synapse maintenance. However, auditory behavioral and physiological assays did not reveal a compelling phenotype. Nonetheless, this study identifies a potentially useful gene expressed in the cochlea and opens the door for future studies aimed at elucidating the function of C1QL1 and the function of the outer hair cell and its afferent neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3163791464,"The use of ethnic identifiers in health systems is recommended in several European countries as a means to identify and address heath inequities. There are barriers to implementation that have not been researched.This study examines whether and how ethnicity data can be collected in Irish general practices in a meaningful and acceptable way.Qualitative case study data generation was informed by Normalization Process Theory (NPT) constructs about 'sense' making and 'engagement'. It consisted of individual interviews and focus group discussions based on visual participatory techniques. There were 70 informants, including 62 general practitioner (GP) users of diverse ethnic backgrounds recruited through community organisations and eight GPs identified through an inter-agency steering group. Data were analysed according to principles of thematic analysis using NPT.The link between ethnicity and health was often considered relevant because GP users grasped connections with genetic (skin colour, lactose intolerance), geographic (prevalence of disease, early years exposure), behavioural (culture/food) and social determinant (housing) factors. The link was less clear with religion. There was some scepticism and questions about how the collection of data would benefit GP consultations and concerns regarding confidentiality and the actual uses of these data (e.g. risk of discrimination, social control). For GPs, the main theme discussed was relevance: what added value would it bring to their consultations and was it was their role to collect these data? Their biggest concern was about data protection issues in light of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The difficulty in explaining a complex concept such as 'ethnicity' in the limited time available in consultations was also worrying.Implementation of an ethnicity identifier in Irish general practices will require a strong rationale that makes sense to GP users, and specific measures to ensure that its benefits outweigh any potential harm. This is in line with both our participants' views and the EU GDPR."
https://openalex.org/W3163902481,"Percutaneous mitral valve leaflet repair is a treatment option for some people with severe mitral valve regurgitation for whom conventional mitral valve surgery is clinically inappropriate. This study aimed to determine the safety, efficacy, and costs of percutaneous mitral valve leaflet repair, using the MitraClip device in a UK setting.This was a prospective, single-armed registry with a follow-up of 2 years that reported a range of procedural, clinical and patient-orientated outcomes. Registry data were linked to routine data sources to allow for more comprehensive follow up concerning mortality and healthcare resource use. The registry received data for 199 mainly elective patients with mixed mitral regurgitation aetiology. A MitraClip device was implanted in 187 patients (94%), with a procedural success rate of 86%, with 8% of patients having a serious in-hospital adverse event (including 5% mortality). Percutaneous mitral valve leaflet repair reduced mitral regurgitation from 100% MR grade ≥ 3+ to 7% at discharge. There were corresponding improvements in New York Heart Association functional class, reducing from 92% (class ≥ 3) at baseline to 18% at 6 weeks. There were significant improvements in generic and disease specific quality of life indicators up to 2 years. The all-cause mortality rate was estimated to be 12.7% (95% CI 7.5 to 17.7%) at 1 year. Percutaneous mitral valve leaflet repair was associated with reduced hospital readmissions and potential cost-savings in post-procedural care.This study shows that percutaneous mitral valve leaflet repair using MitraClip is a relatively safe and effective treatment in patients unable to tolerate surgery and has the potential to reduce ongoing healthcare costs in the UK."
https://openalex.org/W3159985707,"Numerous and extensive 'Stone Walled Sites' have been identified in southern African Iron Age landscapes. Appearing from around 1200 CE, and showing considerable variability in size and form, these settlements are named after the dry-stone wall structures that characterize them. Stone Walled Sites were occupied by various Bantu-speaking agropastoral communities. In this paper we test the use of pXRF (portable X-ray fluorescence analysis) to generate a 'supplementary' archaeological record where evident stratigraphy is lacking, survey conditions may be uneven, and excavations limited, due to the overall site size. We propose herein the application of portable X-ray fluorescence analysis (pXRF) coupled with multivariate exploratory analysis and geostatistical modelling at Seoke, a southern African SWS of historical age (18th century CE). The aim of the paper is twofold: to explore the potential of the application of a low cost, quick, and minimally invasive technique to detect chemical markers in anthropogenic sediments from a Stone Walled Site, and to propose a way to analyse the results in order to improve our understanding of the use of space at non-generalized scales in such sites."

The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical and ultrasound (US) characteristics of pediatric LNM in order to make mutual comparison between their entities and enable the most accurate preoperative diagnosis. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 250 pediatric patients treated by surgical excision or sclerotherapy in our institution in the period from July 2009 to June 2019. Lymphatic malformation was the most frequent congenital LNM (60.9%), while reactive or granulomatous lymphadenitis was the most frequent acquired LNM (47%). Congenital anomalies were significantly more often localized in the upper half of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle region, and had more often soft consistency than acquired ones. Congenital LNM had a 32.37 (3.44-304.63) times higher likelihood of incorrect (p = 0.002) and 5.86 (1.35-25.48) times higher likelihood of undetermined (p = 0.018) than correct US findings, respectively. Acquired LNM were significantly more often localized in the region behind the SCM muscle and more often had solid US appearance in comparison to the congenital ones. Association of the clinical and US findings is very important in determining the most accurate preoperative diagnosis without exposing the children to unnecessary utilizing ionizing radiation or anesthesia. Although they are mostly benign, extreme caution is necessary due to malignancies which were found in 16.4% of all our patients."
https://openalex.org/W3160643004,"Unpaid housework among married working couples is largely done by women in Japan, causing health losses due to work-to-family conflict. However, monetary values for the poor health condition of working mothers with multiple roles have not been explored. The purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of health conditions on life satisfaction (LS) among middle-aged Japanese men and women and attach a monetary value to self-assessed poor health (SAPH). The well-being valuation approach applied monetary values to health losses among middle-aged working persons, using a total of 6,779 married workers drawn from a nationwide 6 wave (2007, 2009, 2011–2014) longitudinal data from the Japanese Life Course Panel Survey of Middle-aged Persons. Female workers having multiple roles as employees and housewives, who spent at least 35 hours per week on market work are defined as women with multiple roles. LS was used as a proxy of individuals’ subjective well-being. Considering the endogeneity between SAPH and LS, I used the two-stage residual inclusion approach with generalized residuals. Major findings are (1) health losses of women with multiple roles were 1.47 times of the equivalent household income; larger than those of men with multiple roles, and (2) health losses of women with multiple roles can be reduced by around 9.5% of the equivalent household income if the spouse shares the housework by engaging in frequent cleaning of the house. Taking health losses of women with multiple roles into consideration, middle-aged men should reconsider the allocation of work attributable to the attitudes toward gender roles."
https://openalex.org/W3161008671,"Pathologists generally pan, focus, zoom and scan tissue biopsies either under microscopes or on digital images for diagnosis. With the rapid development of whole-slide digital scanners for histopathology, computer-assisted digital pathology image analysis has attracted increasing clinical attention. Thus, the working style of pathologists is also beginning to change. Computer-assisted image analysis systems have been developed to help pathologists perform basic examinations. This paper presents a novel lightweight detection framework for automatic tumor detection in whole-slide histopathology images. We develop the Double Magnification Combination (DMC) classifier, which is a modified DenseNet-40 to make patch-level predictions with only 0.3 million parameters. To improve the detection performance of multiple instances, we propose an improved adaptive sampling method with superpixel segmentation and introduce a new heuristic factor, local sampling density, as the convergence condition of iterations. In postprocessing, we use a CNN model with 4 convolutional layers to regulate the patch-level predictions based on the predictions of adjacent sampling points and use linear interpolation to generate a tumor probability heatmap. The entire framework was trained and validated using the dataset from the Camelyon16 Grand Challenge and Hubei Cancer Hospital. In our experiments, the average AUC was 0.95 in the test set for pixel-level detection."
https://openalex.org/W3161915033,"Within the context of universal health coverage (UHC), South Africa has embarked on a series of health sector reforms. The implementation of the Ideal Clinic Realisation and Maintenance (ICRM) programme is a major UHC reform. Cooperative governance is enshrined in South Africa's Constitution, with health a concurrent competency of national and provincial government. Hence, effective inter-governmental relations (IGR) are essential for the ICRM programme implementation.The aim of the study was to measure the cohesion of IGR, specifically consultation, support and information sharing, across national, provincial and local government health departments in the ICRM programme implementation.Using Provan and Milward's theory on network effectiveness, this study was a whole network design social network analysis (SNA). The study was conducted in two districts in Gauteng (GP) and Mpumalanga (MP) provinces of South Africa. Following informed consent, we used both an interview schedule and a network matrix to collect the social network data from health policy actors in national, provincial and local government. We used UCINET version 6.619 to analyse the SNA data for the overall network cohesion and cohesion within and between the government spheres.The social network analysis revealed non-cohesive relationships between the different spheres of government. In both provinces, there was poor consultation in the ICRM programme implementation, illustrated by the low densities of seeking advice (GP = 15.6%; MP = 24.4%) and providing advice (GP = 14.1%; MP = 25.1%). The most cohesive relationships existed within the National Department of Health (density = 66.7%), suggesting that national policy actors sought advice from one another, rather than from the provincial health departments. A density of 2.1% in GP, and 12.5% in MP illustrated the latter.The non-cohesive relationships amongst policy actors across government spheres should be addressed in order to realise the benefits of cooperative governance in implementing the ICRM programme."
https://openalex.org/W3160480840,"Some deaf children continue to show difficulties in spoken language learning after cochlear implantation. Part of this variability has been attributed to poor implicit learning skills. However, the involvement of other processes (e.g. verbal rehearsal) has been underestimated in studies that show implicit learning deficits in the deaf population. In this study, we investigated the relationship between auditory deprivation and implicit learning of temporal regularities with a novel task specifically designed to limit the load on working memory, the amount of information processing, and the visual-motor integration skills required. Seventeen deaf children with cochlear implants and eighteen typically hearing children aged 5 to 11 years participated. Our results revealed comparable implicit learning skills between the two groups, suggesting that implicit learning might be resilient to a lack of early auditory stimulation. No significant correlation was found between implicit learning and language tasks. However, deaf children's performance suggests some weaknesses in inhibitory control."
https://openalex.org/W3160590219,"Bovine pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (boPAG) are expressed by trophoblast cells in the bovine placenta. The multigene family of boPAG belongs to the group of aspartic proteases. The accumulation and circulation in maternal blood and milk has made boPAG very useful and important for pregnancy diagnosis in cattle. The goal of the present study was to develop and validate a new Sandwich-ELISA which allows the detection of boPAG in maternal serum and whole milk. Therefore, 984 serum and 928 milk samples were collected monthly from 231 Holstein Friesian cows (Bos Taurus) from one week after insemination (p.i.) until six weeks postpartum. The ELISA is able to identify a cow as being pregnant at day 30 p.i. in serum and at day 40 p.i in milk with threshold values of 1.0 ng/ml in serum and 0.0165 ng/ml in milk. The postpartum half-life of boPAG was estimated to be 6.4 days in serum and 7.1 days in milk. The boPAG profile established during pregnancy in serum and milk showed a typical pattern. The amount of boPAG found in milk was 1.5 % of the amount of boPAG present in serum. In conclusion, a Sandwich-ELISA has been developed to quantify boPAG in serum and in whole milk simultaneously with the same test procedure. This is time saving for farmers and more efficient for laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W3160702074,"Objectives Although racial stigma in school is associated with adolescent risky health behaviors, there are no studies investigating how gender stigma relates to adolescent risky health behaviors among low-income, minority youth. We sought to determine whether gender stigma awareness is associated with adolescent risky health behaviors (delinquency, fighting, and substance use) and whether this association is mediated by school disengagement (low perceived teacher support, low school engagement, cutting classes, and breaking school rules) among low-income, minority students. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional survey data, collected from 2017 to 2019, from 412 high school students. Multi-level logistic regressions tested whether gender stigma awareness was associated with delinquency, fighting, and substance use, controlling for covariates, baseline behaviors, and clustering within schools. Mediation analyses tested whether school disengagement (low school engagement, perceived teacher support, cutting class, and breaking school rules) mediated these associations. Secondary analyses explored whether associations differed for male versus female, high-performing versus low-performing, and Latinx versus non-Latinx students. Results In this predominantly Latinx (83%) sample, gender stigma awareness was associated with delinquency (AOR = 1.48, P &lt; 0.001) and fighting (AOR = 1.15, P &lt; 0.001). School engagement, perceived teacher support, breaking school rules, and cutting classes mediated 42.7% of the association between gender stigma awareness and delinquency and 65.42% of the association between gender stigma awareness and fighting. Gender stigma awareness was also associated with substance use for low-performing (AOR = 1.68, P = 0.003) and non-Latinx adolescents (AOR = 3.80, P = 0.03). School disengagement did not mediate the association between gender stigma awareness and substance use for non-Latinx students but mediated 50% of this association for low-performing students. Conclusions Gender stigma awareness is associated with adolescent risky health behaviors. A decreased sense of acceptance in the school community and increased school misbehavior may mediate these associations. School environments that value and accept all students may better support adolescent health."
https://openalex.org/W3161450417,"Neurogenic claudication is a typical manifestation of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). However, its pathophysiology is still unclear. The severity of clinical symptoms has been shown not to correlate with the degree of structural stenosis. Altered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow has been suggested as one of the causative factors of LSS. The objectives of this study were to compare CSF dynamics at the lumbosacral level between patients with LSS and healthy controls and to investigate whether CSF dynamics parameters explain symptom severity in LSS. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) was conducted to measure CSF dynamics in 18 healthy controls and 9 patients with LSS. Cephalic peak, caudal peak, and peak-to-peak CSF velocities were evaluated at the lumbosacral level in the patients and controls. The power of CSF dynamics parameters to predict symptom severity was determined using a linear regression analysis adjusted for demographic and structural variables. Significantly attenuated CSF flow velocity was observed in the patients compared with the controls. The cephalic peak, caudal peak, and peak-to-peak velocities at the lumbar level were greater in the controls than in the patients (p<0.001). The predictive power increased most when the peak-to-peak velocity was added (adjusted R2 = 0.410) to the model with age, body mass index, and the minimum anterior-posterior diameter (adjusted R2 = 0.306), and the peak-to-peak velocity was the only statistically significant variable. CSF dynamics variables showed an association with the severity of LSS symptoms, independent of structural stenosis. PC-MRI can help to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurogenic claudication and support the diagnosis of LSS."

This natural retrospective cohort study compared clinical outcomes of two successive cohorts of consecutive recipients of retransplants receiving 5 x 1 mg/kg (rATG-5, n = 100) or a single 3 mg/kg (rATG-3, n = 110) dose of rATG induction therapy. All patients had negative complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch and no anti-HLA A, B, DR donor-specific antibodies (DSA). The primary endpoint was efficacy failure (first biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death) at 12 months. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of efficacy failure (18.0% vs. 21.8%, HR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.66-2.25), respectively. There were no differences in 3-years freedom from biopsy proven acute rejection, and patient, graft, and death-censored graft survivals. There were no differences in the incidence of surgical complications (25.0% vs. 18.2%; p 0.151), early hospital readmission (27.8% vs. 29.5%; p = 0.877) and CMV infections (49% vs. 40%; p = 0.190). There were also no differences in the incidence (59.6% vs. 58.7%, p = 0.897) and duration of delayed graft function but a stable difference in estimate glomerular filtration rate was observed from month 1 (54.7±28.8 vs. 44.1±25.3 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.005) to month 36 (51.1±27.7 vs. 42.5±24.5, p = 0.019).

This cohort analysis did not detect differences in the incidence of efficacy failure and in safety outcomes at 12 months among recipients of kidney retransplants without A, B, and DR DSA, receiving induction therapy with a single 3 mg/kg rATG dose or the traditional 5 mg/kg rATG."
https://openalex.org/W3162289622,"The intestinal structure is the foundation for various activities and functions in poultry. An important question concerns the changes in the intestinal status under endotoxin stimulation. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of intestinal injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Wahui pigeons.Thirty-six 28-day-old healthy Wahui pigeons were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group was injected with LPS (100 μg/kg) once per day for five days, and the control group was treated with the same amount of sterile saline. Blood and the ileum were collected from pigeons on the first, third, and fifth days of the experiment and used for oxidative stress assessment, inflammatory factor detection, histopathological examination, and positive cell localization. In addition, intestinal injury indices and mRNA expression levels (tight junction proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and factors related to autophagy and apoptosis) were evaluated.Villi in the ileum were shorter in the LPS group than in the control group, and D-lactic acid levels in the serum were significantly increased. Glutathione and catalase levels significantly decreased, but the malondialdehyde content in the serum increased. TNF-α and IL-10 were detected at higher levels in the serum, with stronger positive signals and higher mRNA expression levels, in the LPS group than in the control group. In addition, the levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, and HMGB1 in the inflammatory signaling pathway were also upregulated. Finally, the mRNA expression of Claudin3, Occludin, and ZO-1 was significantly decreased; however, that of Beclin1 and Atg5 was increased in the LPS group.Ileal pathological changes and oxidative stress were caused by LPS challenge; it is proposed that this triggering regulates the inflammatory response, causing excessive autophagy and apoptosis, promoting intestinal permeability, and leading to intestinal injury in Wahui pigeons."
https://openalex.org/W3162300541,"During influenza A virus (IAV) entry, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein is triggered by endosomal low pH to undergo irreversible structural changes that mediate membrane fusion. HA proteins from different isolates vary in the pH at which they become activated in endosomes or become irreversible inactivated if exposed to extracellular acid. Little is known about extracellular pH in the upper respiratory tracts of mammals, how pH may shift during IAV infection, and its impact on replication of viruses that vary in HA activation pH. Here, we inoculated DBA/2J mice intranasally with A/TN/1-560/2009 (H1N1) (activation pH 5.5) or a mutant containing the destabilizing mutation HA1-Y17H (pH 6.0). We measured the kinetics of extracellular pH during infection using an optical pH-sensitive microsensor probe placed in the naris, nasal sinus, soft palate, and trachea. We also measured intracellular pH of single-cell suspensions of live, primary lung epithelial cells with various wavelength pH-sensitive dyes localized to cell membranes, cytosol, endosomes, secretory vesicles, microtubules, and lysosomes. Infection with either virus decreased extracellular pH and increased intracellular pH. Peak host immune responses were observed at 2 days post infection (DPI) and peak pH changes at 5 DPI. Extracellular and intracellular pH returned to baseline by 7 DPI in mice infected with HA1-Y17H and was restored later in wildtype-infected. Overall, IAV infection altered respiratory tract pH, which in turn modulated replication efficiency. This suggests a virus-host pH feedback loop that may select for IAV strains containing HA proteins of optimal pH stability, which may be approximately pH 5.5 in mice but may differ in other species."
https://openalex.org/W3162623375,"Automated analysis of video can now generate extensive time series of pose and motion in freely-moving organisms. This requires new quantitative tools to characterise behavioural dynamics. For the model roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, body pose can be accurately quantified from video as coordinates in a single low-dimensional space. We focus on this well-established case as an illustrative example and propose a method to reveal subtle variations in behaviour at high time resolution. Our data-driven method, based on empirical dynamic modeling, quantifies behavioural change as prediction error with respect to a time-delay-embedded 'attractor' of behavioural dynamics. Because this attractor is constructed from a user-specified reference data set, the approach can be tailored to specific behaviours of interest at the individual or group level. We validate the approach by detecting small changes in the movement dynamics of C. elegans at the initiation and completion of delta turns. We then examine an escape response initiated by an aversive stimulus and find that the method can track return to baseline behaviour in individual worms and reveal variations in the escape response between worms. We suggest that this general approach-defining dynamic behaviours using reference attractors and quantifying dynamic changes using prediction error-may be of broad interest and relevance to behavioural researchers working with video-derived time series."
https://openalex.org/W3163468989,"According to cross-sectional studies, oxygen saturation is elevated in retinal vessels in diabetic patients. We evaluated how retinal oxygenation (metabolic marker), vessel diameters and retinopathy grade (structural markers) change over time in diabetic patients.Prospective cohort study following screening in a hospital setting.Retinal oximetry images were acquired in 214 patients with the Oxymap T1 oximeter. Imaging was repeated after a median of 3.0 years (range 0.76-6.8 years). Oxygen saturation and vessel diameters were measured in the right eye. Semiquantitative grading of retinopathy according to international guidelines and red lesion count were performed on fundus photographs.Retinopathy grade according to the international semiquantitative grading system was unchanged. Arteriolar saturation increased by 0.75±0.15 percentage points per year of follow-up (p<0.0001). Venular saturation increased by 1.74±0.26 percentage points per year (p<0.0001) and arteriovenous difference decreased by 0.99±0.20 percentage points per year (p<0.0001). Arteriolar diameters decreased by 2.7±8.5μm (p<0.0001) between visits and venular diameters decreased by 2.4±9.1μm (p = 0.0002). Median increase in red lesion count between visits was 2 lesions (range -128 to 212 lesions, p<0.0001). The change in red lesion count and change in diameters did not correlate with the length of follow-up (p>0.44).Oxygen saturation in larger retinal vessels can increase and arteriovenous difference can decrease over time in diabetic patients without any observable changes in retinopathy grade. The results suggest that changes in retinal oxygen saturation may precede progression of diabetic retinopathy or that oxygen saturation is more sensitive to disease progression than retinopathy grade."

However, several fundamental unresolved problems persist, including a suitable definition of creativity and the ability of psychometric tests to measure divergent thinking-an important component of creativity-in a way that aligns with theory. It is this latter point that this registered report is designed to address. We propose to administer two divergent thinking tests (the verbal and figural versions of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; TTCT) with an intelligence test (the International Cognitive Ability Resource test; ICAR). We will then subject the subscores from these tests to confirmatory factor analysis to test which of nine theoretically plausible models best fits the data. When this study is completed, we hope to better understand whether the degree to which the TTCT and ICAR measure distinct constructs.

These designations are used in recruiting international medical graduates (IMGs) trained in primary care or subspecialty (e.g., oncology) to areas of need. Whether the MUA/HPSA designation correlates with Oncologist Density (OD) and supports IMG oncologists' recruitment to areas of need is unknown. We evaluated the concordance of OD with the designation of MUAs/HPSAs and evaluated the impact of OD and MUA/HPSA status on overall survival. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with hematological malignancies or metastatic solid tumors in 2011 from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. SEER was linked to the American Medical Association Masterfile to calculate OD, defined as the number of oncologists per 100,000 population at the county level. We calculated the proportion of counties with MUA or HPSA designation for each OD category. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the OD category using a log-rank test. We identified 68,699 adult patients with hematologic malignancies or metastatic solid cancers in 609 counties. The proportion of MUA/HPSA designation was similar across counties categorized by OD (93.2%, 95.4%, 90.3%, and 91.7% in counties with <2.9, 2.9-6.5, 6.5-8.4 and >8.4 oncologists per 100K population, p = 0.7). Patients' median survival in counties with the lowest OD was significantly lower compared to counties with the highest OD (8 vs. 11 months, p<0.0001). The difference remained statistically significant in multivariate and subgroup analysis. MUA/HPSA status was not associated with survival (HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.97-1.09, p = 0.3). MUA/HPSA designation based on primary care services is not concordant with OD. Patients in counties with lower OD correlated with inferior survival. Federal programs designed to recruit physicians in high-need areas should consider the availability of health care services beyond primary care."
https://openalex.org/W3162113177,"Background Physical inactivity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The benefits of exercise in patients with chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, are well established. For patients with sickle cell disease, medical recommendation was to avoid physical exercise for fear of triggering painful crises or increasing the impairment of the cardiopulmonary function. Only recently, studies have shown safety in exercise programs for this population. Despite that, there is no report that assess the effects of physical exercise on cardiac parameters in patients with sickle cell disease. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the impact of regular physical exercise (a home-based program) on cardiovascular function in patients with sickle cell disease. Design A quasi-randomized prospective controlled trial. Setting During the years 2015 and 2016, we started recruiting among adult patients treated at a Brazilian Center for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease to participate in a study involving a home exercise program. The experimental (exercise) and control groups were submitted to clinical evaluation and cardiovascular tests before and after the intervention. Analysis of variance was applied to compare groups, considering time and group factors. Participants Twenty-seven adult outpatients with a sickle cell disease diagnosis. Interventions Exercise group (N = 14): a regular home-based aerobic exercise program, three to five times per week not exceeding give times per week, for eight weeks; no prescription for the control group (N = 13). Main outcome measures Echocardiographic and treadmill test parameters. Results The exercise group showed significant improvement in cardiovascular tests, demonstrated by increased distance traveled on a treadmill (p&lt;0.01), increased ejection fraction (p &lt; 0.01) and improvement of diastolic function assessed by mitral tissue Doppler E’ wave on echocardiography (p = 0.04). None of the patients presented a sickle cell crisis or worsening of symptoms during the exercise program. Conclusion The selected home-based exercise program is safe, feasible, and promotes a favorable impact on functional capacity and cardiovascular function in sickle cell disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W3162122282,"The monitoring of infrared thermal images is reported to analyze changes in skin temperature in the hand fingers when repetitive work is performed to know which finger has a greater risk of injury, besides, the recovery time is analyzed regarding the initial temperature and its relationship with age, sex, weight, height if practice sports, and Body Mass Index (BMI) per individual. For the above, an experimental test was carried out for 10 minutes on a repetitive operation that takes place in the telecommunications industry and 39 subjects participated in which an infrared thermal image of the dorsal and palmar part of both hands was taken in periods of 5 minutes after the 10-minute test has elapsed. The results show that none of the participants recovered their initial temperature after 10 minutes of the experimental test. In addition, it was found that there is a relationship between skin temperature and sex, and that age influences the recovery of temperature. On the other hand, the thumb, index, and middle fingers have a higher risk of injury in the analyzed task. It is concluded that performing repetitive work with all the fingers of the hand does not show that all they have the same risk of injury, besides that, not all the variables studied affect the recovery of temperature and its behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3160062562,"Laughter and smiling are significant facial expressions used in human to human communication. We present a computational model for the generation of facial expressions associated with laughter and smiling in order to facilitate the synthesis of such facial expressions in virtual characters. In addition, a new method to reproduce these types of laughter is proposed and validated using databases of generic and specific facial smile expressions. In particular, a proprietary database of laugh and smile expressions is also presented. This database lists the different types of classified and generated laughs presented in this work. The generated expressions are validated through a user study with 71 subjects, which concluded that the virtual character expressions built using the presented model are perceptually acceptable in quality and facial expression fidelity. Finally, for generalization purposes, an additional analysis shows that the results are independent of the type of virtual character's appearance."
https://openalex.org/W3160753294,"Alternative pigment sources that are harmless to human health and can be produced in an eco-responsible way are of great research interest. The experiments undertaken in this study were conducted using autumn leaves of Aesculus hippocastanum as potential novel colorant sources. This study focused on improving the Gauss-peak spectra method (a less expensive alternative to high-pressure liquid chromatography) in combination with thin-layer chromatography, leading to the development of a new methodology. The collected leaves were stored at two different temperatures: 20°C and -20°C. The data obtained by spectrophotometric scanning of the samples were analyzed using the Gauss-peak spectra method in the R program with three wavelength ranges: 350-750 nm, 390-710 nm, and 400-700 nm. The results were then assessed for statistically significant differences in the estimated concentrations for the different wavelength ranges regarding (1) total pigment, carotenoid, and chlorophyll concentration (two-sample t-test) and (2) concentration of each indicated pigment (two-way analysis of variance). The results were also tested for differences between the estimated concentrations of samples stored under the different conditions. The Gauss-peak spectra results with and without thin-layer chromatography were statistically compared using a paired t-test. The results showed that thin-layer chromatography greatly enhanced the efficiency of the Gauss-peak spectra method for estimating the major and minor pigment composition without generating high additional costs. A wavelength range of 400-700 nm was optimal for all Gauss-peak spectra methods. In conclusion, the proposed method is a more successful, inexpensive alternative to high-pressure liquid chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W3160894012,"To analyze the effect of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (nRT) on prognosis in patients with locoregional Siewert type II gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEA).All patients pathologically diagnosed as Siewert type II GEA between 2004 and 2015 were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Final Results (SEER) database. We analyzed the impact of different treatment regimens on the prognosis in each stage. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method. Multivariate Cox model and propensity score matching was further used to verify the results.4,160 patients were included in this study. The efficacy of nRT was superior to that of adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) (p = 0.048), which was the same as that of surgery combined with chemotherapy (p = 0.836), but inferior to the overall survival (OS) of surgical treatment alone (p<0.001) in T1-2N0M0 patients. Patients receiving nRT had distinctly better survival than those receiving surgical treatment alone (p = 0.008), but had similar survival compared with patients treated with aRT (p = 0.989) or surgery combined with chemotherapy (p = 0.205) in the T3N0/T1-3N+M0 subgroup. The efficacy of nRT is clearly stronger than that of surgical therapy alone (p<0.001), surgery combined with chemotherapy (p<0.001), and aRT (p = 0.008) in patients with T4 stage. The survival analysis results were consistent before and after propensity score matching.In these carefully selected patients, the present study made the following recommendations: nRT can improve the prognosis of patients with T3N0M0/T1-3N+M0 and T4 Siewert type II GEA, and it seems to be a better treatment for T4 patients. Surgery alone seems to be sufficient, and nRT is not conducive to prolonging the survival of Siewert II GEA patients with T1-2N0M0 stage. Of course, further prospective trials are needed to verify this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W3161051403,"Reef fishes support important fisheries throughout the Caribbean, but a combination of factors in the tropics makes otolith microstructure difficult to interpret for age estimation. Therefore, validation of ageing methods, via application of Δ14C is a major research priority. Utilizing known-age otolith material from north Caribbean fishes, we determined that a distinct regional Δ14C chronology exists, differing from coral-based chronologies compiled for ageing validation from a wide-ranging area of the Atlantic and from an otolith-based chronology from the Gulf of Mexico. Our north Caribbean Δ14C chronology established a decline series with narrow prediction intervals that proved successful in ageing validation of three economically important reef fish species. In examining why our north Caribbean Δ14C chronology differed from some of the coral-based Δ14C data reported from the region, we determined differences among study objectives and research design impact Δ14C temporal relationships. This resulted in establishing the first of three important considerations relevant to applying Δ14C chronologies for ageing validation: 1) evaluation of the applicability of original goal/objectives and study design of potential Δ14C reference studies. Next, we determined differences between our Δ14C chronology and those from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico were explained by differences in regional patterns of oceanic upwelling, resulting in the second consideration for future validation work: 2) evaluation of the applicability of Δ14C reference data to the region/location where fish samples were obtained. Lastly, we emphasize the application of our north Caribbean Δ14C chronology should be limited to ageing validation studies of fishes from this region known to inhabit shallow water coral habitat as juveniles. Thus, we note the final consideration to strengthen findings of future age validation studies: 3) use of Δ14C analysis for age validation should be limited to species whose juvenile habitat is known to reflect the regional Δ14C reference chronology."
https://openalex.org/W3161962387,"Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is one of the most prevalent injuries in runners. Unfortunately, a substantial part of injured athletes do not recover fully from PFP in the long-term. Although previous studies have shown positive effects of gait retraining in this condition, retraining protocols often lack clinical applicability because they are time-consuming, costly for patients and require a treadmill. The primary objective of this study will be to compare the effects of two different two-week partially supervised gait retraining programs, with a control intervention; on pain, function and lower limb kinematics of runners with PFP. It will be a single-blind randomized clinical trial with six-month follow-up. The study will be composed of three groups: a group focusing on impact (group A), a group focusing on cadence (group B), and a control group that will not perform any intervention (group C). The primary outcome measure will be pain assessed using the Visual Analog Pain scale during running. Secondary outcomes will include pain during daily activities (usual), symptoms assessed using the Patellofemoral Disorders Scale and lower limb running kinematics in the frontal (contralateral pelvic drop; hip adduction) and sagittal planes (foot inclination; tibia inclination; ankle dorsiflexion; knee flexion) assessed using the MyoResearch 3.14—MyoVideo (Noraxon U.S.A. Inc.). The study outcomes will be evaluated before (t0), immediately after (t2), and six months (t24) after starting the protocol. Our hypothesis is that both partially supervised gait retraining programs will be more effective in reducing pain, improving symptoms, and modifying lower limb kinematics during running compared with the control group, and that the positive effects from these programs will persist for six months. Also, we believe that one gait retraining group will not be superior to the other. Results from this study will help improve care in runners with PFP, while maximizing clinical applicability as well as time and cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3162649798,"To enable early identification of university students at high risk for suicide, we examined personality as a predictive factor for major depressive episodes and suicide-related ideation.From 2011 to 2013, we administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) to 1,997 university students at enrollment (T1). We previously conducted a study using the same data set; this is a re-analysis of the dataset. To prevent contamination of data, participants diagnosed with a depressive episode were excluded at T1. Three years after enrollment (T2), we re-administered the PHQ-9 to the same students. We statistically compared TCI scores at T1 among depressive episode groups and suicide-related ideation groups. Two-way ANOVA and Cochran-Armitage trend tests were used to analyze the relationships between personality traits, depressive episodes, and suicide-related ideation.The PHQ-9 summary scores at baseline (T1) were 3.0 (±2.7), with female students scoring 4.6 (±2.9) and male students 2.9 (±2.6, p = 0.025). The major depressive episode group at T2 had lower self-directedness (SD) scores at T1 than the non-depressive episode control group. The suicide-related ideation (SI) group at T2 also had higher harm avoidance (HA), lower SD, and lower cooperativeness (C) scores than the non-SI group at T1. The Cochran-Armitage trend tests revealed significant associations between character configurations composed of SD and C, and both depressive episodes at T2 and SI at T2.The temperament feature of high HA at baseline and character configurations of low SD and low C at baseline are the most contributory predictors for the novel development of depressive episodes and SI among Japanese university students."
https://openalex.org/W3163529580,"Recent clinical trials showed that short aspirin duration (1 or 3 months) in dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy reduced the risk of bleeding and did not increase the ischemic risk compared to 12-month DAPT in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, it is unclear about the optimal duration of aspirin in P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of aspirin treatment duration on clinical outcomes in a cohort of ACS patients with early aspirin interruption and received P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018, we included 498 ACS patients (age 70.18 ± 12.84 years, 71.3% men) with aspirin stopped for various reasons before 6 months after PCI and received P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. The clinical outcomes between those with aspirin treatment ≤ 1 month and &gt; 1 month were compared in 12-month follow up after PCI. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the covariates between groups. The mean duration of aspirin treatment was 7.52 ± 8.10 days vs. 98.05 ± 56.70 days in the 2 groups (p&lt;0.001). The primary composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, recurrent ACS or unplanned revascularization and stroke occurred in 12.6% and 14.4% in the 2 groups (adjusted HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.85–1.68). The safety outcome of BARC 3 or 5 bleeding was also similar (adjusted HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.34–1.40) between the 2 groups. In conclusion, patients with ≤ 1 month aspirin treatment had similar clinical outcomes to those with treatment &gt; 1 month. Our results indicated that ≤ 1-month aspirin may be enough in P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy strategy for ACS patients undergoing PCI."
