But such large pieces can be expected to be polycrystalline, so it is important to determine the nature and size of the grains involved. Huang et al. use transmission electron microscopy to produce atomic-resolution images at grain boundaries, and map the location, orientation and shape of several hundred grains and boundaries using diffraction-filtered imaging. By correlating grain imaging with scanned probe and transport measurements, they show that the grain boundaries dramatically weaken the mechanical strength of graphene membranes, but do not as dramatically alter their electrical properties. Single-atom-thick graphene sheets can be produced at metre scales, bringing large-area applications in electronics and photovoltaics closer. However, such large pieces can be expected to be polycrystalline, so that it is important to determine the nature and size of grains in large-area graphene. This paper uses a combination of old and new transmission electron microscope techniques to carry out atomic-resolution imaging at grain boundaries as well as mapping of the location, orientation and shape of several hundred grains and boundaries with diffraction-filtered imaging. By correlating grain imaging with scanned probe and transport measurements, it is shown that the grain boundaries dramatically weaken the mechanical strength of graphene membranes, but do not as dramatically alter their electrical properties. The properties of polycrystalline materials are often dominated by the size of their grains and by the atomic structure of their grain boundaries. These effects should be especially pronounced in two-dimensional materials, where even a line defect can divide and disrupt a crystal. These issues take on practical significance in graphene, which is a hexagonal, two-dimensional crystal of carbon atoms. Single-atom-thick graphene sheets can now be produced by chemical vapour deposition1,2,3 on scales of up to metres4, making their polycrystallinity almost unavoidable. Theoretically, graphene grain boundaries are predicted to have distinct electronic5,6,7,8, magnetic9, chemical10 and mechanical11,12,13 properties that strongly depend on their atomic arrangement. Yet because of the five-order-of-magnitude size difference between grains and the atoms at grain boundaries, few experiments have fully explored the graphene grain structure. Here we use a combination of old and new transmission electron microscopy techniques to bridge these length scales. Using atomic-resolution imaging, we determine the location and identity of every atom at a grain boundary and find that different grains stitch together predominantly through pentagon–heptagon pairs. Rather than individually imaging the several billion atoms in each grain, we use diffraction-filtered imaging14 to rapidly map the location, orientation and shape of several hundred grains and boundaries, where only a handful have been previously reported15,16,17,18,19. The resulting images reveal an unexpectedly small and intricate patchwork of grains connected by tilt boundaries. By correlating grain imaging with scanning probe and transport measurements, we show that these grain boundaries severely weaken the mechanical strength of graphene membranes but do not as drastically alter their electrical properties. These techniques open a new window for studies on the structure, properties and control of grains and grain boundaries in graphene and other two-dimensional materials."

https://openalex.org/W2139359479,"Aponte et al. show that optogenetic activation of a population of hypothalamic neurons expressing agouti-related peptide (AGRP) is sufficient to evoke voracious feeding behavior in mice. This feeding was not dependent on suppressing the activity of anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin–expressing neurons, suggesting that AGRP neurons directly engage feeding circuits. Two intermingled hypothalamic neuron populations specified by expression of agouti-related peptide (AGRP) or pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) positively and negatively influence feeding behavior, respectively, possibly by reciprocally regulating downstream melanocortin receptors. However, the sufficiency of these neurons to control behavior and the relationship of their activity to the magnitude and dynamics of feeding are unknown. To measure this, we used channelrhodopsin-2 for cell type–specific photostimulation. Activation of only 800 AGRP neurons in mice evoked voracious feeding within minutes. The behavioral response increased with photoexcitable neuron number, photostimulation frequency and stimulus duration. Conversely, POMC neuron stimulation reduced food intake and body weight, which required melanocortin receptor signaling. However, AGRP neuron–mediated feeding was not dependent on suppressing this melanocortin pathway, indicating that AGRP neurons directly engage feeding circuits. Furthermore, feeding was evoked selectively over drinking without training or prior photostimulus exposure, which suggests that AGRP neurons serve a dedicated role coordinating this complex behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2087544898,"Fibrosis is a pathological process characterized by infiltration and proliferation of mesenchymal cells in interstitial space. A substantial portion of these cells is derived from residing non-epithelial and/or epithelial cells that have acquired the ability to migrate and proliferate. The mesenchymal transition is also observed in cancer cells to confer the ability to metastasize. Here, we show that renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction and metastasis of human cancer xenografts are suppressed by administration of secreted Klotho protein to mice. Klotho is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells. The extracellular domain of Klotho is secreted by ectodomain shedding. Secreted Klotho protein directly binds to the type-II TGF-β receptor and inhibits TGF-β1 binding to cell surface receptors, thereby inhibiting TGF-β1 signaling. Klotho suppresses TGF-β1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) responses in cultured cells, including decreased epithelial marker expression, increased mesenchymal marker expression, and/or increased cell migration. In addition to TGF-β1 signaling, secreted Klotho has been shown to inhibit Wnt and IGF-1 signaling that can promote EMT. These results have raised the possibility that secreted Klotho may function as an endogenous anti-EMT factor by inhibiting multiple growth factor signaling pathways simultaneously.

IntroductionThe klotho gene was originally identified as a putative aging-suppressor gene in mice that extended life span when overexpressed (1Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Clark J.D. Pastor J.V. Nandi A. Gurnani P. McGuinness O.P. Chikuda H. Yamaguchi M. Kawaguchi H. Shimomura I. Takayama Y. Herz J. Kahn C.R. Rosenblatt K.P. Kuro-o M. Science. 2005; 309: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar) and induced complex phenotypes resembling human premature-aging syndromes when disrupted (2Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T. Nishikawa S. Nagai R. Nabeshima Y.I. Nature. 1997; 390: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). The klotho gene belongs to a family 1 glycosidases and encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein of ∼135 kDa expressed predominantly in renal tubular epithelial cells (2Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T. Nishikawa S. Nagai R. Nabeshima Y.I. Nature. 1997; 390: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). The intracellular domain is very short (10-amino acid long) and has no known functional domains. The extracellular domain is subject to ectodomain shedding. Klotho protein is clipped on the cell surface by membrane-anchored proteases and the entire extracellular domain (∼130 kDa) is released into systemic circulation (1Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Clark J.D.

Thus, Klotho protein exists in two forms: membrane Klotho and secreted Klotho.Membrane Klotho functions as an obligate co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) (6Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Baum M.G. Schiavi S. Hu M.C. Moe O.W. Kuro-o M. J. Biol.

Nature. 2006; 444: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). FGF23 is a bone-derived hormone that acts on kidney to promote phosphate excretion into urine and suppress vitamin D synthesis, thereby inducing negative phosphate balance (8White K.E. Evans W.E. O'Rlordan J.L.H. Speer M.C. Econs M.J. Lorenz-Deplereux B. Grabowski M. Meitinger T. Storm T.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 9Shimada T. Hasegawa H.

One critical feature of FGF23 is that it has very low affinity to FGF receptors (10Yu X. Ibrahimi O.A. Goetz R. Zhang F. Davis S.I. Garringer H.J. Linhardt R.J. Ornitz D.M. Mohammadi M. White K.E. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 4647-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). FGF23 requires membrane Klotho to bind to its cognate FGF receptors and exert its biological activity. Membrane Klotho forms a constitutive binary complex with FGF receptors to create a de novo high-affinity binding site for FGF23 (6Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Miyoshi M. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P.

Namely, membrane Klotho functions as an obligate co-receptor for FGF23.Secreted Klotho functions as a humoral factor independently of FGF23. Secreted Klotho regulates activity of multiple ion channels (12Chang Q. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Topala C.N. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G.

In addition, secreted Klotho binds to Wnt ligands (16Liu H. Fergusson M.M. Castilho R.M. Liu J. Cao L. Chen J. Malide D. Rovira II Schimel D. Kuo C.J. Gutkind J.S. Hwang P.M. Finkel T.

Renal fibrosis is characterized by infiltration and proliferation of myofibroblasts (fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells with contractile capability) in interstitial space. The origin of myofibroblasts can be fibroblasts migrating from bone marrow (19Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar), residing renal proximal tubular cells (19Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar), and/or renal interstitial pericytes (20Humphreys B.D. Lin S.L. Kobayashi A. Hudson T.E. Nowlin B.T. Bonventre J.V. Valerius M.T. McMahon A.P. Duffield J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Regardless of the origin, these cells must undergo a phenotypic transition and acquire the ability to migrate and proliferate to become myofibroblasts. This cellular process (mesenchymal transition) is regarded as a response to tissue injury, but can result in fibrosis under pathological settings in kidney as well as in many other tissues, including liver, lung, and heart (21Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7388) Google Scholar). Importantly, cancer cells can also undergo mesenchymal transition and acquire the ability to migrate and proliferate, leading to metastasis (21Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7388) Google Scholar).Although several cytokines and growth factors are involved in mesenchymal transition, TGF-β1 has been identified as the most potent and universal growth factor that can independently induce mesenchymal transition in various types of cells (22Willis B.C. Borok Z. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2007; 293: L525-L534Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 inhibits expression of the genes essential for an epithelial phenotype (e.g. E-cadherin) and induces expression of the genes that confer a mesenchymal phenotype (e.g. vimentin, collagen-1, N-cadherin) and invasiveness (e.g. metalloproteases), thereby conferring the ability to migrate on the cell (23Zeisberg M. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The critical role of TGF-β1 in tissue fibrosis and cancer metastasis has been further endorsed by the fact that neutralizing antibodies for TGF-β1 suppress renal fibrosis (24Ling H. Li X. Jha S. Wang W. Karetskaya L. Pratt B. Ledbetter S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25El Chaar M. Chen J. Seshan S.V. Jha S. Richardson I. Ledbetter S.R. Vaughan Jr., E.D. Poppas D.P. Felsen D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 292: F1291-F1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and cancer metastasis (26Ganapathy V. Ge R. Grazioli A. Xie W. Banach-Petrosky W. Kang Y. Lonning S. McPherson J. Yingling J.M. Biswas S. Mundy G.R. Reiss M. Mol. Cancer. 2010; 9: 122Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In this work, we report a novel function of secreted Klotho; it interferes TGF-β1 signaling by directly binding to type-II TGF-β receptor and inhibiting TGF-β1 binding. We also show that renal fibrosis is associated with significant decrease in renal Klotho expression and that Klotho replacement therapy (injection of secreted Klotho protein) alleviates renal fibrosis. Lastly, we show that secreted Klotho protein inhibits EMT in cultured cancer cells and suppresses cancer metastasis in mice.RESULTSRecent studies demonstrated that forced expression of the klotho gene in extra-renal tissues mitigated decline of renal function in rodent models of chronic and acute renal failure (18Haruna Y. Kashihara N. Satoh M. Tomita N. Namikoshi T. Sasaki T. Fujimori T. Xie P. Kanwar Y.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2331-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 31Sugiura H.

Hypertension. 2002; 39: 838-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), suggesting that the klotho gene product might function as a renoprotective factor in a non-cell-autonomous manner. To test a hypothesis that the secreted Klotho might mediate the renoprotective properties of the klotho gene, we investigated potential therapeutic effects of secreted Klotho on experimentally induced renal damage in mice.UUO (obstruction of the right ureter by ligation) is a well-characterized experimental procedure that induces acute renal fibrosis in rodents (33Klahr S. Morrissey J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F861-F875Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Ureteral obstruction induces hydronephrosis and results in renal fibrosis within a week. To determine whether Klotho protects kidneys from fibrosis induced by UUO, we administered purified recombinant secreted Klotho protein (0.01 mg/kg or 0.02 mg/kg) or vehicle into mice immediately after UUO by intraperitoneal injection followed by every other day injection and evaluated renal fibrosis 3 days and 7 days after UUO.UUO induced progressive hydronephrosis as evidenced by enlargement of right renal pelvis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis (Fig. 1A) (27Togao O. Doi S. Kuro-o M. Masaki T. Yorioka N. Takahashi M. Radiology. 2010; 255: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The average volume of pelvis was not different between Klotho-treated and vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 1B), indicating that Klotho treatment did not affect the severity of hydronephrosis induced by UUO. In contrast, the average volume of renal parenchyma in vehicle-treated mice was significantly smaller than that in Klotho-treated mice (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that Klotho treatment prevented parenchymal contraction associated with fibrosis. The contralateral non-obstructed left kidney did not exhibit significant changes in the pelvis and parenchymal volume (Fig. 1, A and B).Another characteristic feature of UUO-induced renal fibrosis is infiltration of myofibroblasts into the interstitial space, which, in combination with contraction of the parenchymal volume, results in significant increase in parenchymal cell density. Increases in cell density and extracellular matrices associated with fibrosis restrict Brownian motion of water molecule in interstitial space that can be quantified by MRI as decreases in ADC (34Lyng H. Haraldseth O. Rofstad E.K. Magn. Reson. Med. 2000; 43: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We reported that decrease in ADC was correlated with increase in cell density and expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), a marker for myofibroblasts, in UUO-induced renal fibrosis (27Togao O. Doi S. Kuro-o M. Masaki T. Yorioka N. Takahashi M. Radiology. 2010; 255: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The average ADC value in Klotho-treated mice was significantly higher than that in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that Klotho treatment alleviated increases in cell density in renal parenchyma.FIGURE 2Effects of Klotho protein injection on renal cell density in UUO mice determined by MRI.

These observations suggest that Klotho protein injection is an effective treatment for renal fibrosis induced by UUO. Because UUO significantly reduced Klotho expression (Fig. 4A) and Klotho replacement therapy alleviated renal fibrosis, we conclude that reductions in renal Klotho expression contribute to pathogenesis of renal fibrosis.FIGURE 3Effects of Klotho protein injection on cell density and fibrosis in UUO mice determined by histological analysis.

Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). We observed significant increase in expression of multiple mesenchymal markers in the UUO kidney, including αSMA (Fig. 4B, supplemental Fig. S1), collagen-1 (Fig. 4C, supplemental Fig. S2), Vimentin, and Matrix metallopeptidases (MMP-2, -3, -9) (supplemental Fig. S3) at the mRNA and/or protein levels. We also observed increased expression of Twist and Snail-1 (supplemental Fig. S3), transcription factors that transactivate these genes to confer mesenchymal phenotypes (35Acloque H. Adams M.S. Fishwick K. Bronner-Fraser M. Nieto M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Of note, induction of Snail-1 expression was sufficient to induce renal fibrosis in mice (36Boutet A. De Frutos C.A. Maxwell P.H. Mayol M.J. Romero J. Nieto M.A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5603-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Klotho treatment attenuated induction of Snail-1, as well as all these mesenchymal markers (Fig. 4, B and C, supplemental Figs. S1–S3).Because Snail-1 expression is primarily induced by TGF-β1 (37Peinado H. Quintanilla M. Cano A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21113-21123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), we speculated that Klotho might suppress UUO-induced increases in TGF-β1 expression in kidney. However, it was not the case (Fig. 4D). Expression of other inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1α and TNF-α, were not suppressed, either (data not shown). These observations suggest that secreted Klotho does not reduce TGF-β1 expression through alleviating inflammatory responses, in general, but may specifically inhibit TGF-β1 signaling.To test this possibility, we stimulated cultured renal epithelial cells (NRK52E) with TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of secreted Klotho protein and asked if Klotho might inhibit the canonical TGF-β1 signaling pathway. TGF-β1 signaling is mediated by two types of receptor serine-threonine kinases (38Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Binding of TGF-β1 to the type-II receptor (TGFβR2) recruits and activates the type-I receptor (TGFβR1) that phosphorylates Smad2/3. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 translocates into the nucleus and functions as a transcription factor to regulate expression of TGF-β1 target genes. Klotho inhibited TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 in a dose-dependent manner in NRK52E cells (Fig. 5A) and transactivation of a Smad-responsive reporter in HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells (Fig. 5B) and in NRK52E cells (supplemental Fig. S5). Klotho also suppressed TGF-β1-induced increases in αSMA (Fig. 5C) and Vimentin (Fig. 5D) expression in cultured renal epithelial cells.FIGURE 5Klotho protein inhibits TGF-β1 signaling and suppresses expression of mesenchymal markers in cultured cells. A, Klotho inhibits TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2.

https://openalex.org/W1980910300,"Background There is consensus that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) can be mediated by myelin specific T cells of Th1 as well as of Th17 phenotype, but the contribution of either subset to the pathogenic process has remained controversial. In this report, we compare functional differences and pathogenic potential of “monoclonal” T cell lines that recognize myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) with the same transgenic TCR but are distinguished by an IFN-γ producing Th1-like and IL-17 producing Th17-like cytokine signature. Methods and Findings CD4+ T cell lines were derived from the transgenic mouse strain 2D2, which expresses a TCR recognizing MOG peptide 35–55 in the context of I-Ab. Adoptive transfer of Th1 cells into lymphopenic (Rag2−/−) recipients, predominantly induced “classic” paralytic EAE, whereas Th17 cells mediated “atypical” ataxic EAE in approximately 50% of the recipient animals. Combination of Th1 and Th17 cells potentiated the encephalitogenicity inducing classical EAE exclusively. Th1 and Th17 mediated EAE lesions differed in their composition but not in their localization within the CNS. While Th1 lesions contained IFN-γ, but no IL-17 producing T cells, the T cells in Th17 lesions showed plasticity, substantially converting to IFN-γ producing Th1-like cells. Th1 and Th17 cells differed drastically by their lytic potential. Th1 but not Th17 cells lysed autoantigen presenting astrocytes and fibroblasts in vitro in a contact-dependent manner. In contrast, Th17 cells acquired cytotoxic potential only after antigenic stimulation and conversion to IFN-γ producing Th1 phenotype. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that both Th1 and Th17 lineages possess the ability to induce CNS autoimmunity but can function with complementary as well as differential pathogenic mechanisms. We propose that Th17-like cells producing IL-17 are required for the generation of atypical EAE whereas IFN-γ producing Th1 cells induce classical EAE."
https://openalex.org/W1994982825,"TAR DNA binding protein 43 KD (TDP-43) is an essential gene that regulates gene transcription, mRNA splicing and stability. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), two fatal neurodegenerative diseases, TDP-43 is fragmented, generating multiple fragments that include the C-terminal fragment of ∼25 KD. The role of these fragments in the pathogenesis of ALS and FTD is not clear. Here we investigated the aggregation propensity in various polypeptide regions of TDP-43 in mammalian cells and the effect of these fragments on cultured neurons. By expressing the full length and various TDP-43 fragments in motor neuron-derived NSC-34 cells and primary neurons, we found that both N- and C-terminal fragments of TDP-43 are prone to aggregate and the C-terminal end of RRM2 region is required, though not sufficient, for aggregation. The aggregation of the TDP-43 fragments can drive co-aggregation with the full-length TDP-43, consequently reducing the nuclear TDP-43. In addition, the TDP-43 fragments can impair neurite growth during neuronal differentiation. Importantly, overexpression of the full-length TDP-43 rescues the neurite growth phenotype whereas knockdown of the endogenous TDP-43 reproduces this phenotype. These results suggest that TDP-43 fragments, particularly the pathologically relevant C-terminal fragments, can impair neuronal differentiation by dominant-negatively interfering with the function of the full length TDP-43, thus playing a role in pathogenesis in ALS and FTD."

https://openalex.org/W1974186916,"The molecular chaperone Hsp90 has been found to be essential for viability in all tested eukaryotes, from the budding yeast to Drosophila. In mammals, two genes encode the two highly similar and functionally largely redundant isoforms Hsp90α and Hsp90β. Although they are co-expressed in most if not all cells, their relative levels vary between tissues and during development. Since mouse embryos lacking Hsp90β die at implantation, and despite the fact that Hsp90 inhibitors being tested as anti-cancer agents are relatively well tolerated, the organismic functions of Hsp90 in mammals remain largely unknown. We have generated mouse lines carrying gene trap insertions in the Hsp90α gene to investigate the global functions of this isoform. Surprisingly, mice without Hsp90α are apparently normal, with one major exception. Mutant male mice, whose Hsp90β levels are unchanged, are sterile because of a complete failure to produce sperm. While the development of the male reproductive system appears to be normal, spermatogenesis arrests specifically at the pachytene stage of meiosis I. Over time, the number of spermatocytes and the levels of the meiotic regulators and Hsp90 interactors Hsp70-2, NASP and Cdc2 are reduced. We speculate that Hsp90α may be required to maintain and to activate these regulators and/or to disassemble the synaptonemal complex that holds homologous chromosomes together. The link between fertility and Hsp90 is further supported by our finding that an Hsp90 inhibitor that can cross the blood-testis barrier can partially phenocopy the genetic defects."

https://openalex.org/W1989737064,"We report that extended exposure to broad-spectrum terahertz radiation results in specific changes in cellular functions that are closely related to DNA-directed gene transcription. Our gene chip survey of gene expression shows that whereas 89% of the protein coding genes in mouse stem cells do not respond to the applied terahertz radiation, certain genes are activated, while other are repressed. RT-PCR experiments with selected gene probes corresponding to transcripts in the three groups of genes detail the gene specific effect. The response was not only gene specific but also irradiation conditions dependent. Our findings suggest that the applied terahertz irradiation accelerates cell differentiation toward adipose phenotype by activating the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG). Finally, our molecular dynamics computer simulations indicate that the local breathing dynamics of the PPARG promoter DNA coincides with the gene specific response to the THz radiation. We propose that THz radiation is a potential tool for cellular reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2110065237,"Background Addictive drugs have in common that they cause surges in dopamine (DA) concentration in the mesolimbic reward system and elicit synaptic plasticity in DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Cocaine for example drives insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at glutamatergic synapes in DA neurons. However it remains elusive which molecular target of cocaine drives such AMPAR redistribution and whether other addictive drugs (morphine and nicotine) cause similar changes through their effects on the mesolimbic DA system. Methodology / Principal Findings We used in vitro electrophysiological techniques in wild-type and transgenic mice to observe the modulation of excitatory inputs onto DA neurons by addictive drugs. To observe AMPAR redistribution, post-embedding immunohistochemistry for GluA2 AMPAR subunit was combined with electron microscopy. We also used a double-floxed AAV virus expressing channelrhodopsin together with a DAT Cre mouse line to selectively express ChR2 in VTA DA neurons. We find that in mice where the effect of cocaine on the dopamine transporter (DAT) is specifically blocked, AMPAR redistribution was absent following administration of the drug. Furthermore, addictive drugs known to increase dopamine levels cause a similar AMPAR redistribution. Finally, activating DA VTA neurons optogenetically is sufficient to drive insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPARs, mimicking the changes observed after a single injection of morphine, nicotine or cocaine. Conclusions / Significance We propose the mesolimbic dopamine system as a point of convergence at which addictive drugs can alter neural circuits. We also show that direct activation of DA neurons is sufficient to drive AMPAR redistribution, which may be a mechanism associated with early steps of non-substance related addictions."

We investigated the mechanisms by which adrenergic signaling alters AMPK activation in vivo. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is highly enriched in sympathetic innervation, which is critical for regulation of energy homeostasis. We performed unilateral denervation of BAT in wild type (WT) mice to abolish neural input. Six days post-denervation, UCP-1 protein levels and AMPK α2 protein and activity were reduced by 45%. In β1,2,3-adrenergic receptor knock-out mice, unilateral denervation led to a 25–45% decrease in AMPK activity, protein expression, and Thr172 phosphorylation. In contrast, acute α- or β-adrenergic blockade in WT mice resulted in increased AMPK α Thr172 phosphorylation and AMPK α1 and α2 activity in BAT. But short term blockade of α-adrenergic signaling in β1,2,3-adrenergic receptor knock-out mice resulted in decreased AMPK activity in BAT, which strongly correlated with enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK on Ser485/491, a site associated with inhibition of AMPK activity. Both PKA and AKT inhibitors attenuated AMPK Ser485/491 phosphorylation resulting from α-adrenergic blockade and prevented decreases in AMPK activity. In vitro mechanistic studies in BAT explants showed that the effects of α-adrenergic blockade appeared to be secondary to inhibition of oxygen consumption. In conclusion, adrenergic pathways regulate AMPK activity in vivo acutely via alterations in Thr172 phosphorylation and chronically through changes in the α catalytic subunit protein levels.

Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates multiple downstream substrates that function to preserve the AMP:ATP ratio through inhibition of ATP-catabolizing pathways and promotion of ATP-generating pathways. Mechanisms involved in AMPK activation include 1) binding of AMP to an allosteric site on the γ subunit, which renders the holoenzyme resistant to inactivating serine phosphatases and may also have direct allosteric effects on kinase activity (1Xue B.

Some data suggest that upstream kinases that may mediate this phosphorylation include AKT (6Berggreen C. Gormand A. Omar B. Degerman E. Göransson O. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2009; 88: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Over the last several years it has become evident that AMPK plays a major role in mediating hormonal, nutrient, and stress-related signals (1Xue B. Kahn B.B. J. Physiol. 2006; 574: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 2Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Importantly, metabolic effects of the adipocyte-secreted hormone leptin are mediated in part through alterations in AMPK activity in both the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues (8Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Müller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). In addition to an acute, transient direct effect of leptin to activate AMPK activity and fatty acid oxidation in muscle, there is also a sustained effect that is mediated through the hypothalamic adrenergic nervous system axis (8Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Müller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). The aims of this study were to determine the cellular mechanisms by which adrenergic signaling pathways regulate AMPK activity in vivo and whether this regulation involves inhibitory phosphorylation of AMPK on Ser485/491. We studied Ser485/491 phosphorylation because the effects of phosphorylation changes at this site on AMPK activity in vivo have not been definitively reported, and this could be a novel mechanism for physiologic regulation of AMPK activity. We utilized BAT as our experimental model because the sympathetic nervous system is critical for key effects of BAT on energy homeostasis including thermogenesis (9Silva J.E. Physiol.

These studies underscore the importance of investigations of the regulation of BAT function to human physiology. Metabolic effects of the sympathetic nervous system are mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors that are broadly classified into two main subtypes: α1–2-, and β1–3-adrenergic receptors (13Lefkowitz R.J.

Recent studies indicate a role for adrenergic receptors in regulating AMPK activity. The effects of leptin through the hypothalamus on muscle AMPK involve α-adrenergic receptors in muscle (8Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Müller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar).

FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Norepinephrine and epinephrine, both dual α and β agonists, activate AMPK in brown adipocytes in vitro (17Hutchinson D.S. Chernogubova E. Dallner O.S. Cannon B. Bengtsson T. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 2386-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and white adipocytes ex vivo (18Koh H.J. Hirshman M.F. He H. Li Y. Manabe Y. Balschi J.A. Goodyear L.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and in the latter, activation of AMPK was necessary for maximal activation of lipolysis (18Koh H.J. Hirshman M.F. He H. Li Y. Manabe Y. Balschi J.A. Goodyear L.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, epinephrine decreases palmitate-induced activation of AMPK in the perfused rat heart (19Clark H. Carling D. Saggerson D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of adrenergic signaling on AMPK activity appears to be tissue-specific and may depend on the metabolic milieu. In vivo studies demonstrated that acute exercise or epinephrine also activates AMPK in rat adipose tissue (18Koh H.J. Hirshman M.F. He H. Li Y. Manabe Y. Balschi J.A. Goodyear L.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because these effects were blunted by a β-adrenergic receptor blocker, the activation of AMPK with exercise or epinephrine appeared to be mediated by β-adrenergic receptors (18Koh H.J. Hirshman M.F. He H. Li Y. Manabe Y. Balschi J.A. Goodyear L.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Further work is needed to understand the adrenergic regulation of AMPK in vivo under other physiologic conditions. Our study demonstrates novel mechanisms for adrenergic regulation of AMPK activity in BAT in vivo. We now show for the first time that chronic adrenergic regulation of AMPK occurs at the level of alterations in AMPK catalytic subunit levels. In contrast, acute regulation is through changes in threonine or serine phosphorylation of AMPK. Furthermore, acute regulation appears to be secondary to changes in BAT oxygen consumption. Adrenergic regulation of Ser485/491 phosphorylation of the AMPK α subunit involves upstream kinases, PKA and AKT. These data provide novel mechanistic insights into how α- and β-adrenergic signals integrate to regulate AMPK activity and expand our understanding of physiologic regulation of AMPK. Because there is currently a large amount of interest in modulating AMPK activity to treat metabolic diseases and potentially cancer, these new findings could have important therapeutic implications. Phentolamine, propranolol, and isoproterenol were purchased from Sigma, AKT inhibitor (10-DEBC) was purchased from Tocris USA, and PKA inhibitor (PKA-I, 14-22) was purchased from Calbiochem. Generation of mice lacking β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR KO) was described previously (20Bachman E.S. Dhillon H. Zhang C.Y. Cinti S. Bianco A.C. Kobilka B.K. Lowell B.B. Science. 2002; 297: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). β-AR KO and its wild type counterparts were bred on a C57BL/6Jx129 background. For validation of certain effects, mice on a FVB background were also employed. Mice were housed with a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle in a temperature-controlled facility with free access to water and standard laboratory chow (Purina #5008, fat content 4.5% by weight/11.9% by calories). All aspects of animal care were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. On the day of the surgery mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection (0.1 ml/10g) of ketamine/xylazine (80 and 12 mg/ml, respectively) except for β-AR KO mice, for which the anesthetic dose was 75% that of the wild type. Anesthetized mice were placed on a warming pad to prevent possible hypothermia. Using a stereomicroscope, intrascapular brown adipose tissue was carefully moved outward from the surrounding muscle and white adipose tissue, thus exposing the sympathetic chain innervating brown adipose tissue (21Scarpace P.J.

Five branches of the left intercostal nerve bundles were isolated and cut (denervated) without disrupting the blood circulation, and the right intercostal nerve bundle was maintained as the contralateral sham side. After completion of the procedure the skin was closed using tissue adhesive glue (Vetbond). After gain of consciousness, mice were housed individually in a clean cage for recovery, and body weight was assessed daily. 1, 2, or 6 days after recovery, animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and sham and denervated brown fat lobes were isolated and frozen at −80 °C until further analysis. On the day of the experiment, food was withdrawn for 2 h. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 10 mg/kg of propranolol or 10 mg/kg phentolamine in WT mice or 8 mg/kg phentolamine in β-AR KO mice (maximum tolerated dose) or saline control. After 30 min of drug administration, animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and brown fat lobes were isolated and frozen at −80 °C until further analysis. Interscapular brown adipose tissues were obtained from 8–10-week-old mice. Tissues were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and minced to a size of 1–2 mm in 6-well plates. The tissue explants were allowed to stabilize for 15 min in Krebs Henseleit buffer (1 m CaCl2, 1.2 m MgSO4, 1.2 m KH2PO4, 0.14 m KCl, 1 m HEPES in 1.2 m NaHCO3, 2.6 m NaCl, 0.01% BSA). Subsequently, explants were incubated with a pharmacological agonist or antagonist for 30 min. Media was aspirated, and explants were transferred to dinonyl phthalate oil to separate BAT from BSA. BAT was further subjected to homogenization, and measurement of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity and immunoblot analysis. BAT was quickly removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until processing. Tissues were homogenized in AMPK immunoprecipitating lysis buffer composed of 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm NaPPi, 250 mm sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 μm benzamidine, 500 μm PMSF, and 50 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Tissue lysates were further solubilized for 40 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Protein concentration in an aliquot of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad DC-Protein Assay kit. Supernatants were stored at −80 °C until assays were performed. To measure AMPK activity, protein (50 μg) was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies specific to AMPK α1 (Upstate, 07-350) or α2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, 19131) bound to protein G-Sepharose overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in immunoprecipitating lysis buffer then twice in assay buffer (240 mm HEPES and 480 mm NaCl). Kinase reactions were carried out in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 80 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each of ATP and AMP, 0.1 mm SAMS peptide, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 50 μl. A 40-μl aliquot was spotted onto Whatman P81 paper and washed 4 times in 1% phosphoric acid. Kinase activity was calculated as [32P]ATP (nmol) incorporated/g of protein/min(22Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferré P. Birnbaum M.J. Stuck B.J. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out on tissue lysates (50 μg) in an assay buffer composed of 80 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.7 mm DTT, 4.2 mm ATP, 1 mm NaHCO3, 8.3 mg/ml BSA, 3.3 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm acetyl-CoA, and 6 μCi of 14CO3 (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence or absence of 2 mm citrate. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 n HCl, and samples were dried. 14CO2 radioactivity was determined with a scintillation counter. ACC activity was calculated as citrate-dependent incorporation of 14CO2 into acid-stable products (pmol/mg of protein/min) (23Goodwin G.W. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 277: E772-E777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates (25–50 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation and total levels of specific proteins were measured by immunoblotting. Antibodies employed for immunoblotting included: anti-pAMPK α-Thr172 (2531), pAKT Thr308 (4056), pPKA Thr197 (4781), pAMPK β-Ser108 (4181), total AMPK β (4182), total PKA (4782), and total ACC (3662) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-AMPK α2 (SC-19131) and UCP1 (SC-6529) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AMPK α1 (07-350), pACC Ser79 (07-303), pAKT Ser473 (05-669), and total AKT (05-591) (Millipore), GAPDH (3073, Imgenex), and fatty acid synthase (3844, Abcam), and CIDEA (Novus Biologicals, H00001149). Proteins were visualized with chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer). Densitometric analysis was performed employing both GeneGnome chemiluminescence imaging system and GeneTools software (Syngene, MD) and Molecular dynamics scanning densitometry. For ACC detection, membranes were incubated with streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (RPN 1231; Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight, washed with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.4% Tween 20 (TBST) three times, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer). Animals were anesthetized, and BAT was isolated and subjected to freeze-clamping (24Ma S.W. Foster D.O. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1984; 62: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Freeze-clamped BAT (10–20 mg wet weight) was pulverized in a mortar under liquid nitrogen and extracted with 0.6 n perchloric acid. An aliquot of the homogenate was removed for protein assay by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After neutralization and centrifugation, the supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter, diadenosine pentaphosphate (100 mmol/ml) was added, and the resulting solution was passed through a 0.2-μm filter. The supernatant (200 μl) was injected into a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Waters 1525 HPLC pump and a 2487 dual wavelength (UV-visible) absorbance detector (Waters Co., Milford MA) to measure nucleotides. ATP, ADP, and AMP were separated through a C-18 reverse phase column (YMC-PackTM ODS-AQTM, 150 × 4.6 mm, particle size 3 μm, pore size 120 Å) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with 50 mm ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 6.0) as the mobile phase during the initial 50 min (26Bak M.I. Ingwall J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Peaks were monitored by UV absorption at 254 nm and identified by comparison with the retention times of known standards. Nucleotide content was quantified using standard curves and normalized to the protein concentration in each sample. Interscapular brown fat was isolated and weighed. Tissue pieces of ∼10–15 mg each were minced and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4; KRH, 25 mm Hepes, 5 mm pyruvate, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm fructose, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 4% fatty acid free BSA (Roche Applied Science)) at 37 °C. O2 consumption was measured polarographically (27Ström K. Hansson O. Lucas S. Nevsten P. Fernandez C. Klint C. Movérare-Skrtic S. Sundler F. Ohlsson C. Holm C. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by a precalibrated electrode (Oxygraph, Hansatech Instruments) in an air-sealed chamber containing 500 μl of KRB buffer at 37 °C with constant agitation. After recording of the basal respiration rate, uncoupled respiration was measured by the addition of 5 mm sodium succinate (Sigma), and respiration was subsequently inhibited by the addition of 2 mm sodium cyanide (Fluka 71429) to the buffer. The final two steps inform us about the viability of the explant. Tracings were recorded, and data were computed using the digital analog program. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance by Student's t test or analysis of variance. Unilateral denervation terminates neural inputs into the brown fat lobe. To determine whether denervation was successful in male FVB mice, UCP-1 protein levels were measured in the denervated and contralateral sham lobe of brown fat. UCP-1 protein decreased by 25% at 2 days after denervation and 45% by 6 days after denervation (Fig. 1A). There was no evidence of compensatory changes in the sham lobe (denervation hypersensitivity) as UCP-1 protein levels remained unaltered on the sham side at 1, 2, and 6 days after denervation (data not shown). We hypothesized that lack of sympathetic innervation would diminish AMPK activity. In FVB mice, AMPK α2 activity was decreased by 45% at 6 days after denervation but not at 1 or 2 days (Fig. 1B). This decline in activity was accompanied by a decrease in AMPK α catalytic subunit Thr172 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C), which appeared to be secondary to a 40% decline in total AMPK α2 protein level (Fig. 1C). The slightly greater decline in total α2 protein compared with phosphorylated α2 can be explained by the fact that the phosphorylated AMPK α Thr172 antibody detects phosphorylation of both α1 and α2 subunits. AMPK α1 activity remained unchanged in either BAT lobe at 1, 2, and 6 days after denervation (data not shown). The seemingly greater AMPK α1 activity compared with α2 activity in BAT is probably due to technical issues related to the specific AMPK α1 and α2 antibodies used in the assay. Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates ACC. Activity of ACC was markedly diminished on days 1 and 2 after denervation before the decline in AMPK activity, suggesting early sympathetic regulation of ACC through an AMPK-independent mechanism (Fig. 1D). ACC protein was decreased by 30–35% on 1, 2, and 6 days after denervation. This most likely explains the decrease in ACC activity and phosphorylation at days 1 and 2 post-denervation (Fig. 1D). The changes in total and phosphorylated levels of ACC were observed in both isoforms (ACC2, upper band; 280 kDa; ACC1, lower band; 266 kDa, Fig. 1D). Both bands were quantified as alterations in phosphorylation of either isoform can have important metabolic effects. Phosphorylation levels of both isoforms were reduced secondary to changes in ACC1 and ACC2 protein levels. Six days after denervation, ACC activity was restored to contralateral sham levels despite decreased ACC protein levels. This indicates increased activity per molecule of ACC, which could result from the diminished AMPK α2 activity at this time point (Fig. 1D). Next, we sought to determine which adrenergic receptor subtype(s) regulates BAT AMPK activity. We first studied mice lacking of β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR KO). No changes in body weight were observed 6 days after unilateral BAT denervation (data not shown). However, UCP-1 protein levels on the sham side of BAT in β-AR KO mice were 40% lower than on the sham side of WT (Fig. 2A), consistent with the fact that UCP-1 is under β-adrenergic control (20Bachman E.S. Dhillon H. Zhang C.Y. Cinti S. Bianco A.C. Kobilka B.K. Lowell B.B. Science. 2002; 297: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Fatty acid synthase levels did not decrease in the sham lobe of β-AR KO mice when compared with WT (Fig. 2B). This indicates that the decrease in UCP-1 expression is not due to a global effect on protein levels. On the denervated side, UCP1 levels were decreased by 40–50% compared with the contralateral sham side in both genotypes (Fig. 2A), indicating some contribution of α-adrenergic or non-adrenergic pathways. Fatty acid synthase levels also decreased by 45% in the denervated lobes in both genotypes, indicating regulation by the autonomic nervous system (Fig. 2B). In both genotypes denervation induced 25–45% decreases in AMPK α1 and α2 activities (Fig. 2, C and D) and corresponding decreases in phosphorylation of AMPK α at Thr172 (Fig. 2E) that most likely result from the down-regulation of AMPK α1 and α2 proteins (Fig. 2, F and G). The ratio of phosphorylated to total AMPK α1 was decreased by 30–40% after denervation in WT and KO mice (Fig. 2H), suggesting a decrease in the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of the AMPK α1 subunit in addition to decreased AMPK α1 protein in the denervated fat pad. However, the ratio of phosphorylated to total AMPK α2 subunit remained unchanged with denervation in WT, indicating that although AMPK α2 protein levels are reduced by denervation (Fig. 2I), the stoichiometry of phosphorylation is intact. Nevertheless, the biological effect is a reduction in the net AMPK α2 phosphorylation in BAT. Surprisingly, in β-AR KO mice the ratio of phosphorylated to total AMPK α2 subunit was decreased by 35% after denervation (Fig. 2I). This indicates that both AMPK α1 and α2 protein levels in BAT are neurally regulated (Fig. 2, F and G) but there are isoform-specific effects of neural innervation on the stoichiometry of AMPK catalytic subunit phosphorylation (Fig. 2, H and I). Cidea has been reported to regulate stability of the AMPK α subunit by interacting with the AMPK β subunit (28Qi J. Gong J. Zhao T. Zhao J. Lam P. Ye J. Li J.Z. Wu J. Zhou H.M. Li P. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1537-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Reduction in β subunits has been shown to result in decreased α subunit levels (28Qi J. Gong J. Zhao T. Zhao J. Lam P. Ye J.

To investigate the molecular mechanism by which denervation down-regulates AMPK protein and activity, we measured Cidea levels in BAT of WT and β-AR KO mice. Denervation increased Cidea protein levels 30–40% in both genotype (Fig. 3, A and B). Total AMPK β protein levels were not altered in either genotype (Fig. 3, A and D) after denervation, but AMPK β Ser108 phosphorylation was decreased (Fig. 3, A and C). This resulted in a decreased stoichiometric ratio of phosphorylated to total AMPK β in the denervated fat pads (Fig. 3E). This phosphorylation site on the AMPK β subunit is critical for the full activity of the AMPK heterotrimer (29Warden S.M. Richardson C. O'Donnell Jr., J. Stapleton D. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Conceivably Ser108 phosphorylation of the AMPK β subunit could affect AMPK α subunit binding and, therefore, its stability. To determine whether adrenergic signaling could modulate AMPK activity without changes in subunit protein levels, we investigated the acute effects of adrenergic antagonists in vivo. Treatment of WT mice with phentolamine (α- adrenergic receptor antagonist) for 30 min resulted in a ∼25–30% increase in AMPK α1 and α2 activities in BAT (Fig. 4, A and B) compared with saline-treated mice. These changes were associated with augmented phosphorylation of AMPK α subunit at T"
https://openalex.org/W2144174185,"The carotene cis-trans isomerase CRTISO is a constituent of the carotene desaturation pathway as evolved in cyanobacteria and prevailing in plants, in which a tetra-cis-lycopene species, termed prolycopene, is formed. CRTISO, an evolutionary descendant of the bacterial carotene desaturase CRTI, catalyzes the cis-to-trans isomerization reactions leading to all-trans-lycopene, the substrate for the subsequent lycopene cyclization to form all-trans-α/β-carotene. CRTISO and CRTI share a dinucleotide binding motif at the N terminus. Here we report that this site is occupied by FAD in CRTISO. The reduced form of this cofactor catalyzes a reaction not involving net redox changes. Results obtained with C(1)- and C(5)-deaza-FAD suggest mechanistic similarities with type II isopentenyl diphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI-2). CRTISO, together with lycopene cyclase CRTY and IDI-2, thus represents the third enzyme in isoprenoid metabolism belonging to the class of non-redox enzymes depending on reduced flavin for activity. The regional specificity and the kinetics of the isomerization reaction were investigated in vitro using purified enzyme and biphasic liposome-based systems carrying specific cis-configured lycopene species as substrates. The reaction proceeded from cis to trans, recognizing half-sides of the symmetrical prolycopene and was accompanied by one trans-to-cis isomerization step specific for the C(5)-C(6) double bond. Rice lycopene β-cyclase (OsLCY-b), when additionally introduced into the biphasic in vitro system used, was found to be stereospecific for all-trans-lycopene and allowed the CRTISO reaction to proceed toward completion by modifying the thermodynamics of the overall reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2009244738,"p120-catenin (p120) is the prototypical member of a subclass of armadillo-related proteins that includes δ-catenin/NPRAP, ARVCF, p0071, and the more distantly related plakophilins 1-3. In vertebrates, p120 is essential in regulating surface expression and stability of all classical cadherins, and directly interacts with Kaiso, a BTB/ZF family transcription factor.To clarify functional relationships between these proteins and how they relate to the classical cadherins, we have examined the proteomes of 14 diverse vertebrate and metazoan species. The data reveal a single ancient δ-catenin-like p120 family member present in the earliest metazoans and conserved throughout metazoan evolution. This single p120 family protein is present in all protostomes, and in certain early-branching chordate lineages. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that gene duplication and functional diversification into ""p120-like"" and ""δ-catenin-like"" proteins occurred in the urochordate-vertebrate ancestor. Additional gene duplications during early vertebrate evolution gave rise to the seven vertebrate p120 family members. Kaiso family members (i.e., Kaiso, ZBTB38 and ZBTB4) are found only in vertebrates, their origin following that of the p120-like gene lineage and coinciding with the evolution of vertebrate-specific mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation by CpG island methylation.The p120 protein family evolved from a common δ-catenin-like ancestor present in all metazoans. Through several rounds of gene duplication and diversification, however, p120 evolved in vertebrates into an essential, ubiquitously expressed protein, whereas loss of the more selectively expressed δ-catenin, p0071 and ARVCF are tolerated in most species. Together with phylogenetic studies of the vertebrate cadherins, our data suggest that the p120-like and δ-catenin-like genes co-evolved separately with non-neural (E- and P-cadherin) and neural (N- and R-cadherin) cadherin lineages, respectively. The expansion of p120 relative to δ-catenin during vertebrate evolution may reflect the pivotal and largely disproportionate role of the non-neural cadherins with respect to evolution of the wide range of somatic morphology present in vertebrates today."

https://openalex.org/W2025618278,"The use of transgenic mice in which subtypes of neurons are labeled with a fluorescent protein has greatly facilitated modern neuroscience research. GAD65-GFP mice, which have GABAergic interneurons labeled with GFP, are widely used in many research laboratories, although the properties of the labeled cells have not been studied in detail. Here we investigate these cells in the hippocampal area CA1 and show that they constitute ∼20% of interneurons in this area. The majority of them expresses either reelin (70±2%) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 15±2%), while expression of parvalbumin and somatostatin is virtually absent. This strongly suggests they originate from the caudal, and not the medial, ganglionic eminence. GFP-labeled interneurons can be subdivided according to the (partially overlapping) expression of neuropeptide Y (42±3%), cholecystokinin (25±3%), calbindin (20±2%) or calretinin (20±2%). Most of these subtypes (with the exception of calretinin-expressing interneurons) target the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells. GFP-labeled interneurons mostly show delayed onset of firing around threshold, and regular firing with moderate frequency adaptation at more depolarized potentials."

Here, we develop a versatile assay for differential chemical inhibition of competing microbial strains, and use it to identify compounds that preferentially inhibit tetracycline-resistant relative to sensitive bacteria, thus ""inverting"" selection for resistance. Our assay distinguishes compounds selecting directly against specific resistance mechanisms and compounds whose selection against resistance is based on their physiological interaction with tetracycline and is more general with respect to resistance mechanism. A pilot screen indicates that both types of selection-inverting compounds are secreted by soil microbes, suggesting that nature has evolved a repertoire of chemicals that counteracts antibiotic resistance. Finally, we show that our assay can more generally permit simple, direct screening for drugs based on their differential activity against different strains or targets."

However, BKCa channels remain active in cells that do not serve to monitor oxygen supply. Using a novel, bacterially derived AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), we show that AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits BKCa channels in a splice variant-specific manner. Inclusion of the stress-regulated exon within BKCa channel α subunits increased the stoichiometry of phosphorylation by AMPK when compared with channels lacking this exon. Surprisingly, however, the increased phosphorylation conferred by the stress-regulated exon abolished BKCa channel inhibition by AMPK. Point mutation of a single serine (Ser-657) within this exon reduced channel phosphorylation and restored channel inhibition by AMPK. Significantly, RT-PCR showed that rat carotid body type I cells express only the variant of BKCa that lacks the stress-regulated exon, and intracellular dialysis of bacterially expressed AMPK markedly attenuated BKCa currents in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W2087362313,"β-Secretase (BACE1) is an attractive drug target for Alzheimer disease. However, the design of clinical useful inhibitors targeting its active site has been extremely challenging. To identify alternative drug targeting sites we have generated a panel of BACE1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that interfere with BACE1 activity in various assays and determined their binding epitopes. mAb 1A11 inhibited BACE1 in vitro using a large APP sequence based substrate (IC(50) ∼0.76 nm), in primary neurons (EC(50) ∼1.8 nm), and in mouse brain after stereotactic injection. Paradoxically, mAb 1A11 increased BACE1 activity in vitro when a short synthetic peptide was used as substrate, indicating that mAb 1A11 does not occupy the active-site. Epitope mapping revealed that mAb 1A11 binds to adjacent loops D and F, which together with nearby helix A, distinguishes BACE1 from other aspartyl proteases. Interestingly, mutagenesis of loop F and helix A decreased or increased BACE1 activity, identifying them as enzymatic regulatory elements and as potential alternative sites for inhibitor design. In contrast, mAb 5G7 was a potent BACE1 inhibitor in cell-free enzymatic assays (IC(50) ∼0.47 nm) but displayed no inhibitory effect in primary neurons. Its epitope, a surface helix 299-312, is inaccessible in membrane-anchored BACE1. Remarkably, mutagenesis of helix 299-312 strongly reduced BACE1 ectodomain shedding, suggesting that this helix plays a role in BACE1 cellular biology. In conclusion, this study generated highly selective and potent BACE1 inhibitory mAbs, which recognize unique structural and functional elements in BACE1, and uncovered interesting alternative sites on BACE1 that could become targets for drug development."

However, it is now increasingly evident that in common with other type I monotopic ER proteins, P450s such as CYPs 3A (both native and structurally inactivated) undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD) involving the ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent 26 S proteasomal system (UPS) (6Correia M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Correia M.A. Drug Metab.

Yet others such as CYP2E1 apparently involve both UPD and ALD (18Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Sohn D.H.

Accordingly, the rat liver CYP2E1 undergoes biphasic degradation with a rapid phase (t½, 7 h) and a slow phase (t½, 37 h) that reflect its degradation via ERAD/UPS and ALD, respectively. The rapid phase is thought to stem from structural damage inflicted by its futile oxidative cycling either in the absence or on withdrawal of an appropriate substrate (i.e. EtOH). Thus, substrate binding stabilizes the CYP2E1 protein and prolongs its half-life, channeling it into the slower ALD pathway. Furthermore, abolition of the redox electron flux through functional inactivation of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (OR) stabilizes CYP2E1 and prolongs its half-life, consistent with its reduced futile oxidative cycling (41Zhukov A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 453-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Goasduff T. Cederbaum A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine the extent to which CYP2E1 catalytic turnover influences the particular route of its degradation, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae not only because of its high evolutionary conservation of the eukaryotic ERAD/UPS/ALD pathways (43Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 44Huyer G. Piluek W.F. Fansler Z. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. Brodsky J.L. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38369-38378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 45Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) but also because its relatively poor constitutive OR content (46Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) would sustain virtually little basal CYP2E1 catalytic turnover. Thus, if CYP2E1 UPD were largely dependent on its futile catalytic turnover, we reasoned that the ALD pathway of CYP2E1 turnover should predominate in these yeast cells. We therefore examined the turnover of heterologously expressed human CYP2E1 in S. cerevisiae strains with genetically defined functional defects in the 19 S Hrd2p/Rpn1 proteasomal subunit (hrd2-1), genetic deletion of the vacuolar (lysosomal) master protease Pep4p (pep4Δ), as well as corresponding isogenic wild type (WT) strains. Our findings revealed that despite the overall sluggish CYP2EI catalytic turnover in yeast, its degradation was still dependent on both ERAD/UPS and ALD as in the mammalian liver. Similar turnover analyses of heterologously expressed CYP2E1 in S. cerevisiae strains (ubc4Δ, ubc4Δ/ubc5Δ, ubc7Δ, and ubc6Δ/ubc7Δ) with specific genetic deletions of the known ERAD-associated E2s Ubc4p, Ubc5p, Ubc6p, and/or Ubc7p (43Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 44Huyer G. Piluek W.F. Fansler Z. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. Brodsky J.L. Michaelis S. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) indicated that Ubc5p and Ubc7p were important for CYP2E1 ERAD. The above findings in yeast were fully consistent with a significant contribution of both ERAD/UPS and ALD to its in vivo turnover in cultured human hepatocytes. In these hepatocytes, CYP2E1 was appreciably ubiquitinated, and this ubiquitination was greatly enhanced after proteasomal inhibition, which stabilized the enzyme. Cotreatment with the ALD inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3MA) and NH4Cl also stabilized CYP2E1. The involvement of Ubc5p in yeast CYP2E1 ERAD is consistent with the reported involvement of its mammalian UbcH5a E2 counterpart in CYP2E1 ubiquitination by CHIP (C terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein), a cytosolic E3 Ub ligase (22Morishima Y. Peng H.M. Lin H.L. Hollenberg P.F. Sunahara R.K. Osawa Y. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16333-16340Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The involvement of Ubc7p suggested that a UBC7-dependent mammalian Ub ligase could also be involved in CYP2E1 ubiquitination. One such E3 candidate is gp78/AMFR (autocrine motility factor receptor), an ER integral protein (47Kostova Z. Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that is involved in CYP3A4 ubiquitination (48Wang Y. Liao M. Hoe N. Acharya P. Deng C. Krutchinsky A.N. Correia M.A. J. Biol.

Our findings described below indicate that both UbcH5a-CHIP and UBC7-gp78 E2-E3 complexes can ubiquitinate CYP2E1 in vitro. As in the case of UBC7/gp78-mediated CYP3A4 ubiquitination (48Wang Y. Liao M. Hoe N. Acharya P. Deng C. Krutchinsky A.N. Correia M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5671-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), protein kinase (PK) A- and/or PKC-mediated phosphorylation also enhanced UBC7/gp78-mediated CYP2E1 ubiquitination. We now document that such protein phosphorylation also enhances UbcH5a/CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of CYP2E1. Furthermore, inhibition of PKA or PKC with a specific inhibitor (KT-5720 or bisindolylmaleimide (BisIII)) or a general inhibitor (staurosporine) blocked both CYP2E1 ubiquitination and turnover in cultured hepatocytes, thereby underscoring the physiological relevance of CYP2E1 protein phosphorylation to its ERAD/UPD. Using LC-MS/MS analyses, we have identified several CYP2E1 residues, in addition to the previously identified Ser129 (28Eliasson E. Johansson I. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 51Pyerin W. Taniguchi H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 52Freeman J.E. Wolf C.R.

Furthermore, we document that this phosphorylation is further enhanced after CYP2E1 structural inactivation by cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH). 3CuOOH at the concentrations used directly inactivates P450 enzymes resulting in oxidative fragmentation of their prosthetic heme to mono- and dipyrrolic products that covalently bind the protein at the active site and irreversibly modify the enzyme, similarly to that observed after DDEP-mediated mechanism-based inactivation of CYP3A (12Correia M.A. Decker C.

Not only is the overall extent of CYP2E1 phosphorylation increased, but additional residues also are targeted for PKA/PKC-mediated phosphorylation.

Acta. 2006; 1763: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). X-ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene located in Xq28, which encodes a peroxisomal member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter subfamily D called ALDP (adrenoleukodystrophy-protein) (2Mosser J. Douar A.M. Sarde C.O. Kioschis P. Feil R. Moser H. Poustka A.M. Mandel J.L. Aubourg P. Nature. 1993; 361: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). This protein has the structure of a half ABC transporter, which is supposed to function as a homodimer (3van Roermund C.W. Visser W.F. Ijlst L. van Cruchten A. Boek M. Kulik W. Waterham H.R.

However, heterodimerization with one of the other members of the ABCD subfamily (i.e. ALDRP (encoded by the ABCD2 gene (5Lombard-Platet G. Savary S. Sarde C.O. Mandel J.L. Chimini G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)), PMP70 (ABCD3 (6Kamijo K. Taketani S. Yokota S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol.

Genet. 1997; 6: 1925-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)) cannot be excluded especially in the situation where these proteins are overexpressed. Although a mirror expression pattern is often observed between ALDP and ALDRP when specific cell types are analyzed (9Troffer-Charlier N. Doerflinger N. Metzger E. Fouquet F. Mandel J.L. Aubourg P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), peroxisomal ABC transporters have overlapping expression patterns rendering possible such interactions (5Lombard-Platet G.

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments or FRET analysis have demonstrated heterodimerization in cells overexpressing the peroxisomal ABC transporters (11Hillebrand M. Verrier S.E. Ohlenbusch A. Schäfer A.

Benarous R. Aubourg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32738-32743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although the peroxisomal localization of ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 is clearly demonstrated, PMP69 has recently been described to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and was found to be absent in the peroxisome. This excludes a possible interaction at the peroxisomal membrane with the other ABC transporters (13Kashiwayama Y. Seki M. Yasui A. Murasaki Y. Morita M. Yamashita Y. Sakaguchi M. Tanaka Y. Imanaka T. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 190-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on the model of the transport of pigment precursors in Drosophila (14Ewart G.D. Cannell D. Cox G.B. Howells A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), differences in the relative expression level of each peroxisomal ABC transporter in a single cell type could lead to alternative dimerization and consequently to a change in substrate specificity.Defective peroxisomal β-oxidation and accumulation of saturated and monounsaturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are the main biochemical features of X-ALD. This observation as well as recent work in yeast (3van Roermund C.W. Visser W.F. Ijlst L. van Cruchten A. Boek M. Kulik W. Waterham H.R. Wanders R.J. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 4201-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) let suppose that ALDP participates in the entry of CoA-esters of VLCFA into the peroxisome, the unique site of their β-oxidation. In fibroblasts, the β-oxidation defect due to ALDP deficiency is partially corrected by overexpression of PMP70 and fully restored by overexpression of ALDRP (15Netik A. Forss-Petter S. Holzinger A. Molzer B. Unterrainer G. Berger J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Flavigny E. Sanhaj A. Aubourg P. Cartier N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, this partial functional gene redundancy is also recognized in vivo because reversion of the adrenomyeloneuropathy-like phenotype has been observed in Abcd1 null mice overexpressing Abcd2 in an ubiquitous manner (17Pujol A. Ferrer I. Camps C. Metzger E. Hindelang C. Callizot N. Ruiz M. Pàmpols T. Giròs M. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ALDRP has been demonstrated to prevent VLCFA accumulation and the onset of a neurological phenotype. Therefore, both ABCD2 and ABCD3 genes constitute potential therapeutic targets for X-ALD in a strategy aimed at inducing their expression through pharmacological treatments. Concerning the substrates, an overlap in the substrate specificity of ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 is likely. Nevertheless, lessons from the different knock-out mice models suggest that PMP70 would preferentially be dedicated to the transport of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid precursors (18Visser W.F. van Roermund C.W. Ijlst L. Waterham H.R. Wanders R.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas ALDRP would play a role in the catabolism of long-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and in the synthesis of DHA (C22:6n-3) (19Fourcade S. Ruiz M. Camps C. Schlüter A. Houten S.M. Mooyer P.A. Pàmpols T. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. Giròs M. Pujol A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E211-E221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the exact nature of the substrates transported by ALDRP and PMP70, their relationship with ALDP, and their state of dimerization (homo- or heterodimerization) absolutely needs further investigations particularly in situations of induced overexpression, a situation found in pharmacological induction based therapies.In this study, we focused on the role of ALDRP and its capability to influence the function of ALDP. We used previously described cell models that allow to induce the expression of a wild type or a mutated non-functional ALDRP-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) fusion protein in a dose-dependent manner (20Gueugnon F. Volodina N. Taouil J.E. Lopez T.E. Gondcaille C. Grand A.S. Mooijer P.A. Kemp S. Wanders R.J. Savary S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These cells are derived from H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells in which ALDRP is almost not expressed in normal conditions, whereas ALDP and PMP70 are highly expressed. We explored the consequences of changes of the ALDRP expression level on fatty acid content in phospholipids (PL) as well as on the levels of β-oxidation of 3 suspected substrates: C26:0, C24:0, and C22:6n-3. We also explored the dimeric status of ALDRP by coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay.DISCUSSIONPharmacological induction of ABCD2 could represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for X-ALD patients. To develop such a therapeutic approach, it is crucial to understand the exact function of ALDRP in normal or overexpressed conditions and compare its function to that of ALDP.Although a defective transport is thought to trigger fatty acid accumulation, expression of ALDP or ALDRP in X-ALD fibroblasts restores the transport and then the degradation of the fatty acids accumulated (15Netik A. Forss-Petter S. Holzinger A. Molzer B. Unterrainer G. Berger J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Flavigny E. Sanhaj A. Aubourg P. Cartier N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The modified H4IIEC3 cell clones cultivated in the absence or presence of increasing doses of doxycycline were expected to represent different situations in which the entry of specific substrates into the peroxisome is altered. The induction of the WT ALDRP-EGFP protein was expected to boost the entry of some fatty acids and their subsequent degradation and then trigger a decrease in the membrane content for these substrates. On the contrary, induction of the D207H-ALDRP-EGFP protein was expected not to modify the fatty acid content of PL and serve as a control.β-Oxidation levels of 14C-labeled C26:0 and C24:0 were found increased in doxycycline-treated cells expressing the WT ALDRP-EGFP fusion protein. Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between the expression level of ALDRP-EGFP and the fatty acid content in PL of VLCFA (C26:0, C24:0, C26:1, and C24:1). These findings are consistent with the observed accumulation of C26:0 and C24:0 in tissues rich in ALDRP in Abcd2 null mice (19Fourcade S. Ruiz M. Camps C. Schlüter A. Houten S.M. Mooyer P.A. Pàmpols T. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. Giròs M. Pujol A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E211-E221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Ferrer I. Kapfhammer J.P. Hindelang C. Kemp S. Troffer-Charlier N. Broccoli V. Callyzot N. Mooyer P. Selhorst J. Vreken P. Wanders R.J. Mandel J.L. Pujol A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3565-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest a role of ALDRP in the transport of these fatty acids and are in agreement with the recognized partial functional redundancy between ALDP and ALDRP toward these substrates.ALDRP has been suggested to play a role in the transport of other saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids such as C20:0, C22:0, and C22:1 (19Fourcade S. Ruiz M. Camps C. Schlüter A. Houten S.M. Mooyer P.A. Pàmpols T. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. Giròs M. Pujol A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E211-E221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The putative role of ALDRP toward these fatty acids has been suggested from the observed accumulation of such fatty acids in specific tissues (adrenals and sciatic nerve) of Abcd2 null mice (19Fourcade S. Ruiz M. Camps C. Schlüter A. Houten S.M. Mooyer P.A. Pàmpols T. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. Giròs M. Pujol A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E211-E221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we could not evidence any changes in the content of these fatty acids. This apparent contradiction could be explained by the short time window (18 h) and by the fact that the doxycycline-dependent variations of ALDRP-EGFP expression are probably not sufficient to drastically change the overall catabolism of these fatty acids. Indeed, LCFA are known to be mainly oxidized in mitochondria. Moreover, our experiments were performed in hepatoma cell models. In the liver of Abcd2 null mice, a modification of the level of these fatty acids was observed only after a 12-month specific diet (19Fourcade S. Ruiz M. Camps C. Schlüter A. Houten S.M. Mooyer P.A. Pàmpols T. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. Giròs M. Pujol A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E211-E221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Altogether, our results do not evidence a role of ALDRP in the transport of saturated and monounsaturated LCFA but do not exclude such a role.Concerning PUFA, the analysis of the n-3 and n-6 PUFA content in PL did not show any variation depending on the expression level of ALDRP-EGFP. However, β-oxidation assays with radiolabeled DHA showed that ALDRP is involved in the transport of DHA. Induction of ALDRP-EGFP resulted in a significant increase of the β-oxidation level of DHA. PUFA content in cells is highly regulated and depends on complex metabolic pathways. Its synthesis from C18:3n-3 requires elongation/desaturation steps and one final cycle of peroxisomal β-oxidation, which forms DHA from its immediate precursor C24:6n-3 (30Ferdinandusse S. Denis S. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1992-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Ferdinandusse S. Denis S. Mooijer P.A. Zhang Z. Reddy J.K. Spector A.A. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1987-1995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DHA is also β-oxidized in the peroxisome. Although ALDP is clearly not involved in DHA metabolism because there is no deficiency in DHA in X-ALD patients, ALDRP-EGFP could participate in the entry of DHA. This would fit with the fact that the hepatic expression of ALDRP is highly sensitive toward dietary PUFA (32Leclercq S. Skrzypski J. Courvoisier A. Gondcaille C. Bonnetain F. André A. Chardigny J.M. Bellenger S. Bellenger J. Narce M. Savary S. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 1602-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover ALDRP was recently suspected to participate in the entry of C24:6n-3 (the immediate precursor of DHA) into the peroxisome as suggested from Abcd2 null mice (19Fourcade S. Ruiz M. Camps C. Schlüter A. Houten S.M. Mooyer P.A. Pàmpols T. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. Giròs M. Pujol A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E211-E221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This dual involvement of ALDRP in the synthesis and degradation of DHA would explain in part the apparent discrepancy between the results from β-oxidation assays and GC-MS analysis in PL. Further explorations of the role of ALDRP in n-3 and n-6 PUFA metabolism are required but depend on the availability of radiolabeled fatty acids.The cell clone expressing a mutated ALDRP-EGFP fusion protein was first used to validate the results obtained with the cell clone expressing the WT ALDRP-EGFP fusion protein. The direct correlation between the level of C26:0 and C26:1 in PL and the expression level of the D207H-ALDRP-EGFP fusion protein demonstrated a transdominant-negative effect of the mutant protein. This effect was also found in β-oxidation assays as a decreased β-oxidation activity of C26:0 was observed upon induction of D207H-ALDRP-EGFP. Duolink and coimmunoprecipitation experiments have evidenced interactions between D207H-ALDRP-EGFP and ALDP. The formation of a non-functional heterodimer D207H-ALDRP-EGFP/ALDP would deprive the cell of functional ALDP/ALDP homodimers and then result in the accumulation of C26:0 and C26:1 mimicking a deficiency on ALDP. Surprisingly, we did not observe such a transdominant-negative effect on the ALDP function toward C24:0. The deprivation in functional ALDP/ALDP homodimers is maybe insufficient to see an accumulation in our cell model concerning this fatty acid. There are currently no clear data about differences in affinity toward C24:0 and C26:0 and/or transport efficiency, which could help to clarify this point. Altogether, we can conclude that D207H-ALDRP-EGFP has a transdominant-negative effect on ALDP function. This is the first demonstration that heterodimerization of peroxisomal half-transporters has functional consequences.This transdominant-negative effect raises several points. The first one concerns therapeutic approaches aimed at overexpressing the ABCD2 gene to compensate for ALDP deficiency. In the absence of the ALDP protein, this strategy remains pertinent. However, in patients in whom a non-functional ALDP is still present and capable to dimerize, pharmacological induction of the ALDRP expression would possibly result in the formation of a majority of non-functional heterodimers. Because a transdominant-negative effect of a mutated ALDP on ALDP function has already been demonstrated (25Unterrainer G. Molzer B. Forss-Petter S. Berger J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2609-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), one can speculate if restoring expression of ALDP in patients expressing a non-functional ALDP protein still able to dimerize would allow compensation for ALDP deficiency. Indeed, the successful results of gene therapy were recently obtained concerned two patients having an ABCD1 gene mutation resulting in the absence of ALDP (33Cartier N. Hacein-Bey-Abina S. Bartholomae C.C. Veres G. Schmidt M. Kutschera I. Vidaud M. Abel U. Dal-Cortivo L. Caccavelli L. Mahlaoui N. Kiermer V. Mittelstaedt D. Bellesme C. Lahlou N. Lefrère F. Blanche S. Audit M. Payen E. Leboulch P. l'Homme B. Bougnères P. Von Kalle C. Fischer A. Cavazzana-Calvo M. Aubourg P. Science. 2009; 326: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). A second point concerns the clear demonstration of the existence of heterodimers and their apparent specificity toward fatty acids substrates. Although the induction of the WT ALDRP-EGFP protein increases the β-oxidation of C26:0, C24:0, and C22:6n-3, and results in a decreased content of C26:0, C24:0, C26:1, and C24:1 in PL, the induction of the mutant ALDRP-EGFP protein has consequences only for C26:0 and C26:1. This would mean that ALDRP/ALDP heterodimers present a preferential substrate specificity toward C26:0 and C26:1, which would be different and more restricted than that of ALDP/ALDP or ALDRP/ALDRP homodimers. ALDP/ALDP homodimers would be dedicated to the transport of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFA (C26:0, C24:0, C26:1, and C24:1). ALDRP/ALDRP homodimers would be able to transport the same fatty acyl-CoA and be specifically dedicated to the transport of PUFA. During submission of this manuscript, functional complementation experiments in the yeast pxa1/pxa2Δ mutant with either ABCD1 or ABCD2 human genes were published (34van Roermund C.W. Visser W.F.

The main conclusions of this study conducted with a different experimental approach are in agreement with our conclusions. They confirmed the substrate specificity overlap between ALDP and ALDRP and demonstrated a preference of ALDP for saturated VLCFA (C24:0 and C26:0) and a preference of ALDRP for C22:0 and n-3 PUFA. In agreement with our results, a specific role of ALDRP in C22:6 β-oxidation was evidenced.Even if our results together with lessons from Abcd1 and Abcd2 null mice are in agreement with the different hypotheses concerning the substrate specificity of homo- and heterodimers, such a model of transport remains speculative. Further studies will be needed to clarify the role of each dimer and see if alternative dimerization depends only on relative stoichiometry or is driven by the substrates.

(OMIM 300100) is a very complex neurodegenerative disorder whose physiopathogenesis remains to be clarified (1Berger J. Gärtner J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). X-ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene located in Xq28, which encodes a peroxisomal member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter subfamily D called ALDP (adrenoleukodystrophy-protein) (2Mosser J.

This protein has the structure of a half ABC transporter, which is supposed to function as a homodimer (3van Roermund C.W. Visser W.F. Ijlst L. van Cruchten A. Boek M. Kulik W. Waterham H.R.

However, heterodimerization with one of the other members of the ABCD subfamily (i.e. ALDRP (encoded by the ABCD2 gene (5Lombard-Platet G. Savary S. Sarde C.O. Mandel J.L. Chimini G. Proc. Natl.

Genet. 1997; 6: 1925-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)) cannot be excluded especially in the situation where these proteins are overexpressed. Although a mirror expression pattern is often observed between ALDP and ALDRP when specific cell types are analyzed (9Troffer-Charlier N. Doerflinger N. Metzger E. Fouquet F. Mandel J.L. Aubourg P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), peroxisomal ABC transporters have overlapping expression patterns rendering possible such interactions (5Lombard-Platet G.

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments or FRET analysis have demonstrated heterodimerization in cells overexpressing the peroxisomal ABC transporters (11Hillebrand M. Verrier S.E. Ohlenbusch A. Schäfer A.

Although the peroxisomal localization of ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 is clearly demonstrated, PMP69 has recently been described to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and was found to be absent in the peroxisome. This excludes a possible interaction at the peroxisomal membrane with the other ABC transporters (13Kashiwayama Y. Seki M. Yasui A. Murasaki Y. Morita M. Yamashita Y. Sakaguchi M. Tanaka Y. Imanaka T. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 190-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on the model of the transport of pigment precursors in Drosophila (14Ewart G.D. Cannell D. Cox G.B. Howells A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), differences in the relative expression level of each peroxisomal ABC transporter in a single cell type could lead to alternative dimerization and consequently to a change in substrate specificity.Defective peroxisomal β-oxidation and accumulation of saturated and monounsaturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are the main biochemical features of X-ALD. This observation as well as recent work in yeast (3van Roermund C.W. Visser W.F. Ijlst L. van Cruchten A. Boek M. Kulik W. Waterham H.R. Wanders R.J. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 4201-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) let suppose that ALDP participates in the entry of CoA-esters of VLCFA into the peroxisome, the unique site of their β-oxidation. In fibroblasts, the β-oxidation defect due to ALDP deficiency is partially corrected by overexpression of PMP70 and fully restored by overexpression of ALDRP (15Netik A. Forss-Petter S. Holzinger A. Molzer B. Unterrainer G. Berger J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Flavigny E. Sanhaj A. Aubourg P. Cartier N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, this partial functional gene redundancy is also recognized in vivo because reversion of the adrenomyeloneuropathy-like phenotype has been observed in Abcd1 null mice overexpressing Abcd2 in an ubiquitous manner (17Pujol A. Ferrer I. Camps C. Metzger E. Hindelang C. Callizot N. Ruiz M. Pàmpols T. Giròs M. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ALDRP has been demonstrated to prevent VLCFA accumulation and the onset of a neurological phenotype. Therefore, both ABCD2 and ABCD3 genes constitute potential therapeutic targets for X-ALD in a strategy aimed at inducing their expression through pharmacological treatments. Concerning the substrates, an overlap in the substrate specificity of ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 is likely. Nevertheless, lessons from the different knock-out mice models suggest that PMP70 would preferentially be dedicated to the transport of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid precursors (18Visser W.F. van Roermund C.W. Ijlst L. Waterham H.R. Wanders R.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas ALDRP would play a role in the catabolism of long-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and in the synthesis of DHA (C22:6n-3) (19Fourcade S.

Despite a lack of mechanistic studies, there are a number of theories positing congeners, dehydration, or the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde as causes of hangover headache.We used a chronic headache model to examine how pure ethanol produces increased sensitivity for nociceptive behaviors in normally hydrated rats.Ethanol initially decreased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli on the face (analgesia), followed 4 to 6 hours later by inflammatory pain. Inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase extended the analgesia whereas inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase decreased analgesia. Neither treatment had nociceptive effects. Direct administration of acetate increased nociceptive behaviors suggesting that acetate, not acetaldehyde, accumulation results in hangover-like hypersensitivity in our model. Since adenosine accumulation is a result of acetate formation, we administered an adenosine antagonist that blocked hypersensitivity.Our study shows that acetate contributes to hangover headache. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of hangover headache and the mechanism of headache induction."

In tennis players, there was a marked asymmetry in the development of the RA, which volume was 35% greater in the non-dominant compared to the dominant side (P<0.001). In contrast, no side-to-side difference in RA volume was observed in the controls (P = 0.75). The degree of side-to-side asymmetry increased linearly from the first lumbar disc to the pubic symphysis (r = 0.97, P<0.001).Professional tennis is associated with marked hypertrophy of the musculus rectus abdominis, which achieves a volume that is 58% greater than in non-active controls. Rectus abdominis hypertrophy is more marked in the non-dominant than in the dominant side, particularly in the more distal regions. Our study supports the concept that humans can differentially recruit both rectus abdominis but also the upper and lower regions of each muscle. It remains to be determined if this disequilibrium raises the risk of injury."
https://openalex.org/W2125598042,"Background Mesenchymal and amoeboid movements are two important mechanisms adopted by cancer cells to invade the surrounding environment. Mesenchymal movement depends on extracellular matrix protease activity, amoeboid movement on the RhoA-dependent kinase ROCK. Cancer cells can switch from one mechanism to the other in response to different stimuli, limiting the efficacy of antimetastatic therapies. Methodology and Principal Findings We investigated the acquisition and molecular regulation of the invasion capacity of neoplastically transformed human fibroblasts, which were able to induce sarcomas and metastases when injected into immunocompromised mice. We found that neoplastic transformation was associated with a change in cell morphology (from fibroblastic to polygonal), a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a decrease in the expression of several matrix metalloproteases and increases in cell motility and invasiveness. In a three-dimensional environment, sarcomagenic cells showed a spherical morphology with cortical actin rings, suggesting a switch from mesenchymal to amoeboid movement. Accordingly, cell invasion decreased after treatment with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, but not with the matrix protease inhibitor Ro 28-2653. The increased invasiveness of tumorigenic cells was associated with reduced expression of Rnd3 (also known as RhoE), a cellular inhibitor of ROCK. Indeed, ectopic Rnd3 expression reduced their invasive ability in vitro and their metastatic potential in vivo. Conclusions These results indicate that, during neoplastic transformation, cells of mesenchymal origin can switch from a mesenchymal mode of movement to an amoeboid one. In addition, they point to Rnd3 as a possible regulator of mesenchymal tumor cell invasion and to ROCK as a potential therapeutic target for sarcomas."

Inward rectifier channels are formed by the homotetrameric or heterotetrameric assembly of subunits. Previous reports demonstrate that Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 subunits can coassemble to form heterotetrameric channels (33Preisig-Müller R. Schlichthörl G. Goerge T. Heinen S. Brüggemann A. Rajan S.

Notably, many Kir2.1 mutants involved with Andersen-Tawil syndrome dominantly suppress inward rectifier current through tetramerization with Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 (33Preisig-Müller R. Schlichthörl G. Goerge T. Heinen S. Brüggemann A. Rajan S. Derst C. Veh R.W. Daut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7774-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Here we describe the interaction and trafficking of wild type Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.6 in mouse skeletal muscle and in COS-1 cells. Although Kir2.6 shares conserved ER and Golgi trafficking motifs with Kir2.1 and Kir2.2, we show that Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 traffic to the plasma membrane and T-tubules, whereas Kir2.6 is largely retained in the ER. We demonstrate that Kir2.6 can associate with Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 in cultured cells and in vivo and causes partial ER retention of Kir2.1 or Kir2.2. Thus, Kir2.6 has a dominant negative effect on the forward trafficking of Kir2.1 and Kir2.2. Our results suggest that through heterotetramerization of subunits, Kir2.6 may control Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 abundance on the muscle plasma membrane, thus providing a mechanism to fine tune electrical responses.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have investigated the trafficking, cellular localization, and subunit interactions of a recently identified human inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.6. This subunit was discovered as a gene that when mutated confers susceptibility to TPP, a condition characterized by muscle weakness or paralysis accompanied by hypokalemia and thyrotoxicosis (22Ryan D.P. da Silva M.R. Soong T.W. Fontaine B. Donaldson M.R. Kung A.W. Jongjaroenprasert W. Liang M.C. Khoo D.H. Cheah J.S. Ho S.C. Bernstein H.S. Maciel R.M. Brown Jr., R.H. Ptácek L.J. Cell. 2010; 140: 88-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here we characterize wild type Kir2.6 to understand how the typical native Kir2.6 contributes to muscle cell biology. Surprisingly, we find that despite its high sequence similarity to other Kir2.x subunits (>98% identity with Kir2.2), Kir2.6 is very poorly trafficked to the surface membrane and instead primarily resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. Whole cell currents of Kir2.6 by itself are very small relative to other inward rectifier subunits because of its low surface expression. However, inward rectifier channels are composed of a heterotetrameric assembly of subunits, and we show that Kir2.6 readily coassembles with other Kir2.x subunits. Because of its dominant trafficking phenotype, Kir2.6 exerts an important regulatory control on the trafficking of inward rectifier channels through dominant negative retention in the ER. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of regulation of the trafficking of strong inward rectifier Kir2 potassium channels by dominant negative interaction with wild type channel subunits.Localization of potassium channels in skeletal muscle is important to their function; Kir2 channels play a major role in setting the cell resting potential, in controlling muscle cell excitability by determining the extent of sodium channel inactivation, and in clearing activity-dependent accumulation of K+ from T-tubules. We have shown by immunocytochemistry that the major skeletal muscle Kir channels Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 are well positioned for these functions, with Kir2.1 channels located on the plasma membrane and the peripheral regions of T-tubules, and Kir2.2 located in central regions of T-tubules and neuromuscular junction (Fig. 6). These results agree well with the proposed localization of inward rectifier channels based on electrophysiological studies in frog skeletal muscle (8Ashcroft F.M. Heiny J.A. Vergara J. J.

Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R766-R772Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed a compelling case for Kir channel localization on T-tubules and plasma membrane was made by Wallinga et al. (15Wallinga W. Meijer S.L. Alberink M.J. Vliek M. Wienk E.D. Ypey D.L. Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), who showed by modeling that maintenance of skeletal muscle excitability and excitation-contraction coupling during repetitive action potential firing requires the presence of Kir channels in these sites for clearance of K+ and prevention of positive shifts in the resting membrane potential. Our results also are in agreement with studies in cardiac muscle in which T-tubule and plasma membrane localization, and their roles in K+ accumulation have been demonstrated (5Clark R.B. Tremblay A.

Soong T.W. Fontaine B. Donaldson M.R. Kung A.W. Jongjaroenprasert W. Liang M.C. Khoo D.H. Cheah J.S. Ho S.C. Bernstein H.S. Maciel R.M. Brown Jr., R.H. Ptácek L.J. Cell. 2010; 140: 88-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with several diversifications acquired throughout evolution, their trafficking and localization are widely different. Exogenous expression of Kir2.6 in both COS-1 cells and mouse skeletal muscle showed colocalization with the ER marker PDI, indicating that Kir2.6 is retained in the ER and trafficked poorly to the plasma membrane (Figs. 1, 7, and 9). In contrast Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 trafficked out of the ER through the Golgi, shown by colocalization with Golgi markers, and finally expressed on T-tubules and the plasma membrane (Figs. 1, 7, and 10 and supplemental Fig. S2).Even though Kir2.6 primarily is retained in the ER, a small proportion of the channel is trafficked to the cell surface in COS-1 cells. We speculated that this surface Kir2.6 formed functional homotetrameric channels. Indeed, electrophysiological investigation confirmed that Kir2.6 can form functional channels on the plasma membrane, in agreement with findings from Ryan et al. (22Ryan D.P. da Silva M.R. Soong T.W. Fontaine B. Donaldson M.R. Kung A.W. Jongjaroenprasert W. Liang M.C. Khoo D.H. Cheah J.S. Ho S.C. Bernstein H.S. Maciel R.M. Brown Jr., R.H. Ptácek L.J. Cell. 2010; 140: 88-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Kir2.6 currents display characteristic inward rectification, with more pronounced inward currents at potentials negative to EK than at potentials positive to EK. However, when compared with Kir2.2, whole cell currents reveal a marked reduction in magnitude, implying that fewer channels are present on the plasma membrane.It is possible that high expression levels and longer expression times in some cultured cells may allow Kir2.6 channels to escape cellular trafficking and quality control mechanisms and may account for larger Kir2.6 current magnitudes observed by Ryan et al. (22Ryan D.P. da Silva M.R. Soong T.W. Fontaine B. Donaldson M.R. Kung A.W. Jongjaroenprasert W. Liang M.C. Khoo D.H. Cheah J.S. Ho S.C. Bernstein H.S. Maciel R.M. Brown Jr., R.H. Ptácek L.J. Cell. 2010; 140: 88-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) in 293T cells. In mouse skeletal muscle, however, even after 7–14 days of expression in vivo, we found no evidence for Kir2.6 trafficking beyond the ER when Kir2.6 was expressed alone, suggesting that it is effectively retained in the ER (Fig. 7). When expressed with Kir2.1 in mouse skeletal muscle, a very low level of Kir2.6 trafficked to the Golgi (Fig. 9). In primate skeletal muscle, it is possible that a tissue-specific and species-specific accessory subunit or chaperone may aid the forward trafficking of Kir2.6; thus, a greater fraction of Kir2.6 might traffic to surface membranes in human skeletal muscle.Although the Kir2.6 sequence includes all known anterograde trafficking signals that are present in other Kir2.x channels, it is still retained in the ER (Figs. 1, 5, 7, 9, and 10). Our studies show that a previously unidentified site, proline 156, is the most essential amino acid for surface trafficking of Kir2.2, and notably, the leucine at position 156 of Kir2.6 caused its retention in the ER (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 8). Alignment of all known human Kir family sequences to identify conserved amino acids shows that the amino acid pair cysteine 155 and proline 156 is conserved among nearly all eukaryotic Kir subunits, but a leucine is present in place of the proline in Kir2.6 (Fig. 11A). Prolines have an established role in α-helical turn structure and are commonly found as the first residue of an α-helix (48Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the three-dimensional structure of Kir2.2 (Protein Data Bank file 3JYC), proline 156 is located at a turn that forms the beginning of the M2 inner helix (Fig. 11B) (49Tao X. Avalos J.L. Chen J. MacKinnon R. Science. 2009; 326: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Significantly, the adjacent cysteine 155 is part of an intrasubunit disulfide with conserved cysteine 123 that is essential for channel function and that bridges the two extracellular loops in eukaryotic Kir2 channels (49Tao X. Avalos J.L. Chen J. MacKinnon R. Science. 2009; 326: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 50Cho H.C. Tsushima R.G. Nguyen T.T. Guy H.R. Backx P.H.

Pflugers Arch. 1999; 438: 778-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mutation of either of these conserved cysteines of Kir2.1 in one subunit of a channel tetramer is sufficient to eliminate wild type Kir2.1 currents in a dominant negative manner (50Cho H.C. Tsushima R.G. Nguyen T.T. Guy H.R. Backx P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4649-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We assume that proline 156 in Kir2.2 induces bending that initiates the M2 helix. Leucine at this position in Kir2.6 likely impacts channel conformation and may alter folding efficiency or disulfide bond formation that could result in retention of Kir2.6 in the ER.Interestingly, the absence of a conserved proline has been implicated in a loss of function of two voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. Kv6.3 and Kv8.1 are electrically silent homotetrameric channels because of retention in the ER, a phenomenon likely resulting from divergence of a proline-containing motif. Study of chimeric subunits between Kv6.3 and Kv2.1 and point mutation analysis in Kv8.1 revealed that a PXP motif, located in the S6 transmembrane domain in the gating hinge, is altered to PXT or PXA in the silent channels, respectively (53Salinas M. de Weille J.

J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank file 2A79).We have shown that Kir2.6 associates with Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4), with important consequences on channel trafficking, plasma membrane abundance, and localization (Figs. 3, 5, 9, and 10). Kir2 channels are known to form by homotetrameric and heterotetrameric assembly of Kir2.x subunits, with the resulting channels reflecting the physiological properties of their subunits (3Hibino H. Inanobe A. Furutani K. Murakami S. Findlay I. Kurachi Y. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 291-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). However, the subunit composition, the extent of heteromultimerization, and the roles of individual subunits in different cell types are not known. Gene knock-out studies in mice showed that Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 contribute to K+ currents in heart in a nonadditive manner, suggesting that these subunits can coassemble in vivo (21Zaritsky J.J. Redell J.B. Tempel B.L. Schwarz T.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, the diversity of channel conductances, Ba2+ block properties, and pH sensitivity also support a model in which channels are composed of homotetrameric and heterotetrameric subunits (33Preisig-Müller R. Schlichthörl G. Goerge T. Heinen S. Brüggemann A. Rajan S. Derst C. Veh R.W. Daut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7774-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 34Zobel C. Cho H.C.

Our data showing the overlapping distribution of endogenous Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channels in skeletal muscle T-tubules are consistent with the idea that a fraction of these subunits coassemble in vivo in skeletal muscle (Fig. 6).Our trafficking studies, in which Kir2.6 causes ER retention of other Kir2.x subunits and colocalization of subunits, provide strong support for heteromultimeric formation of Kir2 channels in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells, and COS-1 cells (Figs. 3, 5, 9, and 10). Kir2.6 is the dominant subunit when it forms a heteromultimer with Kir2.1 or Kir2.2 in vivo and has a stronger dominant negative trafficking effect on Kir2.2 compared with Kir2.1, suggesting that those subunits that are most similar in sequence may have a greater propensity to coassemble. A dominant negative trafficking phenomenon also is a well known explanation for disease-associated mutations in Andersen-Tawil syndrome where Kir2.1 Δ95–98 and Kir2.1 Δ314–315 do not traffic to the plasma membrane. Instead, they are distributed inside the cell, although they retain their ability to coassemble with wild type channels (18Bendahhou S. Donaldson M.R. Plaster N.M. Tristani-Firouzi M. Fu Y.H.

https://openalex.org/W2058084688,"Background The role of p53 in the prevention of development of embryos damaged by genotoxic factors is well recognized. However, whether p53 plays an analogous role in preventing birth defects from genetic mutations remains an unanswered question. Genetic screens for mutations affecting development show that only a fraction of developmentally lethal mutations leads to specific phenotypes while the majority results in similar recurrent phenotypes characterized by neuronal apoptosis and developmental delay. Mutations in cell-essential genes typically fall into this group. The observation that mutations in diverse housekeeping genes lead to a similar phenotype suggests a common mechanism underlying this phenotype. For some mutants, p53 inhibition was shown to attenuate the phenotype. Methodology/Principal Findings To find out how common p53 involvement is in this phenotype, we analyzed zebrafish mutants from various categories of cell essential genes. Several thousand zebrafish mutants have been identified; many of them are kept at stock centers and available for the research community. We selected mutants for genes functioning in DNA replication, transcription, telomere maintenance, ribosome biogenesis, splicing, chaperoning, endocytosis, and cellular transport. We found that mutants have similar phenotypes including neural apoptosis, failure to develop structures originated from the neural crest cells, and hematopoietic defects. All mutants share p53 upregulation and similar changes in several p53-dependent and independent molecular pathways. Conclusion/Significance Our results suggest that mutations in housekeeping genes often canalize on the p53-mediated phenotype. p53 prevents the development of embryos with defects in such genes. p53-mediated changes in gene expression may also contribute to many human congenital malformations."

Ligands binding this target may be used to visualize hypoxia, tumor manifestation or treat tumors by endoradiotherapy. Methods Phage display was performed with a 12 amino acid phage display library by panning against a recombinant extracellular domain of human carbonic anhydrase IX. The identified peptide CaIX-P1 was chemically synthesized and tested in vitro on various cell lines and in vivo in Balb/c nu/nu mice carrying subcutaneously transplanted tumors. Binding, kinetic and competition studies were performed on the CAIX positive human renal cell carcinoma cell line SKRC 52, the CAIX negative human renal cell carcinoma cell line CaKi 2, the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT 116 and on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Organ distribution studies were carried out in mice, carrying SKRC 52 tumors. RNA expression of CAIX in HCT 116 and HUVEC cells was investigated by quantitative real time PCR. Results In vitro binding experiments of 125I-labeled-CaIX-P1 revealed an increased uptake of the radioligand in the CAIX positive renal cell carcinoma cell line SKRC 52. Binding of the radioligand in the colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT 116 increased with increasing cell density and correlated with the mRNA expression of CAIX. Radioligand uptake was inhibited up to 90% by the unlabeled CaIX-P1 peptide, but not by the negative control peptide octreotide at the same concentration. No binding was demonstrated in CAIX negative CaKi 2 and HUVEC cells. Organ distribution studies revealed a higher accumulation in SKRC 52 tumors than in heart, spleen, liver, muscle, intestinum and brain, but a lower uptake compared to blood and kidney. Conclusions These data indicate that CaIX-P1 is a promising candidate for the development of new ligands targeting human carbonic anhydrase IX."
https://openalex.org/W2168123693,"EpsE is an ATPase that powers transport of cholera toxin and hydrolytic enzymes through the Type II secretion (T2S) apparatus in the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio cholerae. On the basis of structures of homologous Type II/IV secretion ATPases and our biochemical data, we believe that EpsE is active as an oligomer, likely a hexamer, and the binding, hydrolysis, and release of nucleotide cause EpsE to undergo dynamic structural changes, thus converting chemical energy to mechanical work, ultimately resulting in extracellular secretion. The conformational changes that occur as a consequence of nucleotide binding would realign conserved arginines (Arg(210), Arg(225), Arg(320), Arg(324), Arg(336), and Arg(369)) from adjoining domains and subunits to complete the active site around the bound nucleotide. Our data suggest that these arginines are essential for ATP hydrolysis, although their roles in shaping the active site of EpsE are varied. Specifically, we have shown that replacements of these arginine residues abrogate the T2S process due to a reduction of ATPase activity yet do not have any measurable effect on nucleotide binding or oligomerization of EpsE. We have further demonstrated that point mutations in the EpsE intersubunit interface also reduce ATPase activity without disrupting oligomerization, strengthening the idea that residues from multiple subunits must precisely interact in order for EpsE to be sufficiently active to support T2S. Our findings suggest that the action of EpsE is similar to that of other Type II/IV secretion ATPase family members, and thus these results may be widely applicable to the family as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W2007576699,"Background The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi dramatically upregulates outer surface protein C (OspC) in response to fresh bloodmeal during transmission from the tick vector to a mammal, and abundantly produces the antigen during early infection. As OspC is an effective immune target, to evade the immune system B. burgdorferi downregulates the antigen once the anti-OspC humoral response has developed, suggesting an important role for OspC during early infection. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, a borrelial mutant producing an OspC antigen with a 5-amino-acid deletion was generated. The deletion didn't significantly increase the 50% infectious dose or reduce the tissue bacterial burden during infection of the murine host, indicating that the truncated OspC can effectively protect B. burgdorferi against innate elimination. However, the deletion greatly impaired the ability of B. burgdorferi to disseminate to remote tissues after inoculation into mice. Conclusions/Significance The study indicates that OspC plays an important role in dissemination of B. burgdorferi during mammalian infection."
https://openalex.org/W2070833420,"Stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders require accurate delivery of the transplanted cells to the sites of damage. Numerous studies have established that fluid injections to the hippocampus can induce lesions in the dentate gyrus (DG) that lead to cell death within the upper blade. Using a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, we previously observed that embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors (ESNPs) survive and differentiate within the granule cell layer after stereotaxic delivery to the DG, replacing the endogenous cells of the upper blade. To investigate the mechanisms for ESNP migration and repair in the DG, we examined the role of the chemokine CXCL12 in mice subjected to kainic acid-induced seizures. We now show that ESNPs transplanted into the DG show extensive migration through the upper blade, along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Seizures upregulate CXCL12 and infusion of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 by osmotic minipump attenuated ESNP migration. We also demonstrate that seizures promote the differentiation of transplanted ESNPs toward neuronal rather than astrocyte fates. These findings suggest that ESNPs transplanted into the adult rodent hippocampus migrate in response to cytokine-mediated signals."
https://openalex.org/W2073301516,"CAF-1 is essential in human cells for the de novo deposition of histones H3 and H4 at the DNA replication fork. Depletion of CAF-1 from various cell lines causes replication fork arrest, activation of the intra-S phase checkpoint, and global defects in chromatin structure. CAF-1 is also involved in coordinating inheritance of states of gene expression and in chromatin assembly following DNA repair. In this study, we generated cell lines expressing RNAi-resistant versions of CAF-1 and showed that the N-terminal 296 amino acids are dispensable for essential CAF-1 function in vivo. N-terminally truncated CAF-1 p150 was deficient in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) binding, reinforcing the existence of two PCNA binding sites in human CAF-1, but the defect in PCNA binding had no effect on the recruitment of CAF-1 to chromatin after DNA damage or to resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Tandem affinity purification of CAF-1-interacting proteins under mild conditions revealed that CAF-1 was directly associated with the KU70/80 complex, part of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, and the phosphoserine/threonine-binding protein 14-3-3 ζ. CAF-1 was a substrate for DNA-dependent protein kinase, and the 14-3-3 interaction in vitro is dependent on DNA-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. These results highlight that CAF-1 has prominent interactions with the DNA repair machinery but that the N terminus is dispensable for the role of CAF-1 in DNA replication- and repair-coupled chromatin assembly."

Genome wide studies from the major focus of disease in India have not previously been reported. Methods and Findings We undertook a GWLS in India in which a primary ∼10 cM (515 microsatellites) scan was carried out in 58 multicase pedigrees (74 nuclear families; 176 affected, 353 total individuals) and replication sought in 79 pedigrees (102 nuclear families; 218 affected, 473 total individuals). The primary scan provided evidence (≥2 adjacent markers allele-sharing LOD≥0.59; nominal P≤0.05) for linkage on Chromosomes 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 20 and X, with peaks at 6p25.3-p24.3 and 8p23.1-p21.3 contributed to largely by 31 Hindu families and at Xq21.1-q26.1 by 27 Muslim families. Refined mapping confirmed linkage across all primary scan families at 2q12.2-q14.1 and 11q13.2-q23.3, but only 11q13.2-q23.3 replicated (combined LOD = 1.59; P = 0.0034). Linkage at 6p25.3-p24.3 and 8p23.1-p21.3, and at Xq21.1-q26.1, was confirmed by refined mapping for primary Hindu and Muslim families, respectively, but only Xq21.1-q26.1 replicated across all Muslim families (combined LOD 1.49; P = 0.0045). STRUCTURE and SMARTPCA did not identify population genetic substructure related to religious group. Classification and regression tree, and spatial interpolation, analyses confirm geographical heterogeneity for linkages at 6p25.3-p24.3, 8p23.1-p21.3 and Xq21.1-q26.1, with specific clusters of families contributing LOD scores of 2.13 (P = 0.0009), 1.75 (P = 0.002) and 1.84 (P = 0.001), respectively. Conclusions GWLS has identified novel loci that show geographical heterogeneity in their influence on susceptibility to VL in India."
https://openalex.org/W1993206064,"Although the processing profile of the membrane-bound epidermal growth factor precursor (pro-EGF) is tissue-specific, it has not been investigated at the cellular level nor have the cognate proteinases been defined. Among the proprotein convertases (PCs), only the membrane-bound PC7, the most ancient and conserved basic amino acid-specific PC family member, induces the processing of pro-EGF into an ∼115-kDa transmembrane form (EGF-115) at an unusual VHPR290↓A motif. Because site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Arg290 is not critical, the generation of EGF-115 by PC7 is likely indirect. This was confirmed by testing a wide range of protease inhibitors, which revealed that the production of EGF-115 is most probably achieved via the activation by PC7 of a latent serine and/or cysteine protease(s). EGF-115 is more abundant at the cell surface than pro-EGF and is associated with a stronger EGF receptor (EGFR) activation, as evidenced by higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2. This suggests that the generation of EGF-115 represents a regulatory mechanism of juxtacrine EGFR activation. Thus, PC7 is distinct from the other PCs in its ability to enhance the activation of the cell surface EGFR.

https://openalex.org/W2052849706,"The DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor is the major downstream output of the insulin/IGF1R signaling pathway controlling C. elegans dauer larva development and aging. To identify novel downstream genes affecting dauer formation, we used RNAi to screen candidate genes previously identified to be regulated by DAF-16. We used a sensitized genetic background [eri-1(mg366); sdf-9(m708)], which enhances both RNAi efficiency and constitutive dauer formation (Daf-c). Among 513 RNAi clones screened, 21 displayed a synthetic Daf-c (SynDaf) phenotype with sdf-9. One of these genes, srh-100, was previously identified to be SynDaf, but twenty have not previously been associated with dauer formation. Two of the latter genes, lys-1 and cpr-1, are known to participate in innate immunity and six more are predicted to do so, suggesting that the immune response may contribute to the dauer decision. Indeed, we show that two of these genes, lys-1 and clc-1, are required for normal resistance to Staphylococcus aureus. clc-1 is predicted to function in epithelial cohesion. Dauer formation exhibited by daf-8(m85), sdf-9(m708), and the wild-type N2 (at 27°C) were all enhanced by exposure to pathogenic bacteria, while not enhanced in a daf-22(m130) background. We conclude that knockdown of the genes required for proper pathogen resistance increases pathogenic infection, leading to increased dauer formation in our screen. We propose that dauer larva formation is a behavioral response to pathogens mediated by increased dauer pheromone production."
https://openalex.org/W2013245499,"Hydroxylation is an important post-translational modification and closely related to various diseases. Besides the biotechnology experiments, in silico prediction methods are alternative ways to identify the potential hydroxylation sites.In this study, we developed a novel sequence-based method for identifying the two main types of hydroxylation sites--hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. First, feature selection was made on three kinds of features consisting of amino acid indices (AAindex) which includes various physicochemical properties and biochemical properties of amino acids, Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSM) which represent evolution information of amino acids and structural disorder of amino acids in the sliding window with length of 13 amino acids, then the prediction model were built using incremental feature selection method. As a result, the prediction accuracies are 76.0% and 82.1%, evaluated by jackknife cross-validation on the hydroxyproline dataset and hydroxylysine dataset, respectively. Feature analysis suggested that physicochemical properties and biochemical properties and evolution information of amino acids contribute much to the identification of the protein hydroxylation sites, while structural disorder had little relation to protein hydroxylation. It was also found that the amino acid adjacent to the hydroxylation site tends to exert more influence than other sites on hydroxylation determination.These findings may provide useful insights for exploiting the mechanisms of hydroxylation."

https://openalex.org/W2088103389,"Hypnomys is a genus of Gliridae (Rodentia) that occurred in the Balearic Islands until Late Holocene. Recent finding of a complete skeleton of the chronospecies H. morpheus (Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene) and two articulated skeletons of H. cf. onicensis (Late Pliocene) allowed the inference of body size and the calculation of several postcranial indexes. We also performed a Factorial Discriminant Analysis (FDA) in order to evaluate locomotory behaviour and body shape of the taxa. Using allometric models based on skull and tooth measurements, we calculated a body weight between 173 and 284 g for H. morpheus, and direct measurements of articulated skeletons yielded a Head and Body Length (HBL) of 179 mm and a Total Body Length of 295 mm for this species. In addition to the generally higher robustness of postcranial bones already recorded by previous authors, H. morpheus, similar to Canariomys tamarani, another extinct island species, displayed elongated zygopodium bones of the limbs and a wider distal humerus and femur than in an extant related taxon, Eliomys quercinus. Indexes indicated that Hypnomys was more terrestrial and had greater fossorial abilities than E. quercinus. This was also corroborated by a Discriminant Analysis, although no clear additional inference of locomotory abilities could be calculated."
https://openalex.org/W1978409100,"The oxaloacetate decarboxylase primary Na+ pump (OAD) is an essential membrane protein complex that functions in the citrate fermentation pathway of some pathogenic bacteria under anaerobic conditions. OAD contains three different subunits: Oad-α, a biotinylated extrinsic protein that catalyzes the α-ketodecarboxylation of oxaloacetate; Oad-γ, a structural bitopic membrane protein whose cytosolic tail (named as Oad-γ′) binds tightly to Oad-α; and Oad-β, a multispan transmembrane α-helical protein that constitutes the Na+ channel. How OAD is organized structurally at the membrane and what the molecular determinants are that lead to an efficient energy coupling mechanism remain elusive. In the present work, we elucidate the stoichiometry of the native complex as well as the low resolution structure of the peripheral components of OAD (Oad-α and Oad-γ′) by small angle x-ray scattering. Our results point to a quaternary assembly similar to the pyruvate carboxylase complex organization. Herein, we propose a model in which the association in pairs of Oad-α dimers, mediated by Oad-γ, results in the acquisition of a functional oligomeric state at the bacterial membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2024546906,"We have previously shown that genetic variability in CNR1 is associated with low HDL dyslipidemia in a multigenerational obesity study cohort of Northern European descent (209 families, median = 10 individuals per pedigree). In order to assess the impact of CNR1 variability on the development of dyslipidemia in the community, we genotyped this locus in all subjects with class III obesity (body mass index >40 kg/m2) participating in a population-based biobank of similar ancestry. Twenty-two haplotype tagging SNPs, capturing the entire CNR1 gene locus plus 15 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream, were genotyped and tested for association with clinical lipid data. This biobank contains data from 645 morbidly obese study subjects. In these subjects, a common CNR1 haplotype (H3, frequency 21.1%) is associated with fasting TG and HDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.031 for logTG; p = 0.038 for HDL-C; p = 0.00376 for log[TG/HDL-C]). The strength of this relationship increases when the data are adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, diet and physical activity. Mean TG levels were 160±70, 155±70, and 120±60 mg/dL for subjects with 0, 1, and 2 copies of the H3 haplotype. Mean HDL-C levels were 45±10, 47±10, and 48±9 mg/dL, respectively. The H3 CNR1 haplotype appears to exert a protective effect against development of obesity-related dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2073363915,"Phylogenetic tree reconstruction is traditionally based on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and heavily depends on the validity of this information bottleneck. With increasing sequence divergence, the quality of MSAs decays quickly. Alignment-free methods, on the other hand, are based on abstract string comparisons and avoid potential alignment problems. However, in general they are not biologically motivated and ignore our knowledge about the evolution of sequences. Thus, it is still a major open question how to define an evolutionary distance metric between divergent sequences that makes use of indel information and known substitution models without the need for a multiple alignment. Here we propose a new evolutionary distance metric to close this gap. It uses finite-state transducers to create a biologically motivated similarity score which models substitutions and indels, and does not depend on a multiple sequence alignment. The sequence similarity score is defined in analogy to pairwise alignments and additionally has the positive semi-definite property. We describe its derivation and show in simulation studies and real-world examples that it is more accurate in reconstructing phylogenies than competing methods. The result is a new and accurate way of determining evolutionary distances in and beyond the twilight zone of sequence alignments that is suitable for large datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2095855080,"POU3F4 is a member of the POU-homedomain transcription factor family with a prominent role in inner ear development. Mutations in the human POU3F4 coding unit leads to X-linked deafness type 3 (DFN3), characterized by conductive hearing loss and progressive sensorineural deafness. Microdeletions found 1 Mb 5′ upstream of the coding region also displayed the same phenotype, suggesting that cis-regulatory elements might be present in that region. Indeed, we and others have recently identified several enhancers at the 1 Mb 5′ upstream interval of the pou3f4 locus. Here we characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of these regulatory elements in zebrafish transgenic lines. We show that the most distal enhancer (HCNR 81675) is activated earlier and drives GFP reporter expression initially to a broad ear domain to progressively restrict to the sensory patches. The proximal enhancer (HCNR 82478) is switched later during development and promotes expression, among in other tissues, in sensory patches from its onset. The third enhancer (HCNR 81728) is also active at later stages in the otic mesenchyme and in the otic epithelium. We also characterize the signaling pathways regulating these enhancers. While HCNR 81675 is regulated by very early signals of retinoic acid, HCNR 82478 is regulated by Fgf activity at a later stage and the HCNR 81728 enhancer is under the control of Hh signaling. Finally, we show that Sox2 and Pax2 transcription factors are bound to HCNR 81675 genomic region during otic development and specific mutations to these transcription factor binding sites abrogates HCNR 81675 enhancer activity. Altogether, our results suggest that pou3f4 expression in inner ear might be under the control of distinct regulatory elements that fine-tune the spatio-temporal activity of this gene and provides novel data on the signaling mechanisms controlling pou3f4 function."

https://openalex.org/W2170195565,"Background Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a central player in the allergic response, and raised total IgE levels are considered as an indicator of atopy or potential development of atopy. A recent genome-wide scan in a German population-based cohort of adults identified the gene encoding the alpha chain of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FCER1A) as a susceptibility locus influencing total serum IgE levels. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the polymorphisms in the FCER1A gene are associated with allergic rhinitis (AR) in a Han Chinese population. Methodology/Principal Findings A population of 378 patients with AR and 288 healthy controls was studied. Precise phenotyping of patients was accomplished by means of a questionnaire and clinical examination. Blood was drawn for DNA extraction and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) measurement. A total of 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FCER1A were selected and individually genotyped. None of the SNPs in the FCER1A showed an association with AR. Similarly, the lack of association was also evident in subgroup analysis for the presence of different allergen sensitivities. None of the selected SNPs in FCER1A was associated with total IgE level. Conclusions Although FCER1A presents itself as a good candidate for contributing to total serum IgE, this study failed to find an association between SNPs in the FCER1A gene region and IgE level or AR susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W1975635195,"Background In most Arthropod groups, the study of systematics and evolution rely mostly on neutral characters, in this context cuticular compounds, as non-neutral characters, represent an underexplored but potentially informative type of characters at the infraspecific level as they have been routinely proven to be involved in sexual attraction. Methods and Findings The collembolan species complex Deutonura deficiens was chosen as a model in order to test the utility of these characters for delineating four infraspecific entities of this group. Specimens were collected for three subspecies (D. d. deficiens, D. d. meridionalis, D. d. sylvatica) and two morphotypes (D. d. sylvatica morphoype A and B) of the complex; an additional species D. monticola was added. Cuticular compounds were extracted and separated by gas chromatography for each individual. Our results demonstrate that cuticular compounds succeeded in separating the different elements of this complex. Those data allowed also the reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships among them. Conclusions The discriminating power of cuticular compounds is directly related to their involvement in sexual attraction and mate recognition. These findings allowed a discussion on the potential involvement of intrinsic and paleoclimatic factors in the origin and the diversification of this complex in the Pyrenean zone. This character type brings the first advance from pattern to process concerning the origin of this species complex."
https://openalex.org/W2001564785,"In clinical situations where a diagnostic real-time PCR assay is not sensitive enough, leading to low or falsely negative results, or where detection earlier in a disease progression would benefit the patient, an unbiased pre-amplification prior to the real-time PCR could be beneficial. In Amp-PCR, an unbiased random Phi29 pre-amplification is combined with a specific real-time PCR reaction. The two reactions are separated physically by a wax-layer (AmpliWax®) and are run in sequel in the same sealed tube. Amp-PCR can increase the specific PCR signal at least 100×106-fold and make it possible to detect positive samples normally under the detection limit of the specific real-time PCR. The risk of contamination is eliminated and Amp-PCR could replace nested-PCR in situations where increased sensitivity is needed e.g. in routine PCR diagnostic analysis. We show Amp-PCR to work on clinical samples containing circular and linear viral dsDNA genomes, but can work well on DNA of any origin, both from non-cellular (virus) and cellular sources (bacteria, archae, eukaryotes)."
