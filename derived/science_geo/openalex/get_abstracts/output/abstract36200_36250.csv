https://openalex.org/W2015037479,"I have identified an activity in crude HeLa cell extracts that satisfies the requirements for a human telomere terminal transferase or telomerase. It catalyzes the addition of a 6 nucleotide repeating pattern to oligonucleotide primers containing human or nonhuman telomeric repeat sequences. Direct sequence analyses of reaction products reveal the added sequence to be TTAGGG in all cases. Under optimal conditions 65-70 repeats can be synthesized. The enzyme has the properties of a ribonucleoprotein. Telomerase has previously been observed only in ciliated protozoans, which possess 10(4) - 10(7) macronuclear telomeres. The identification of telomerase in HeLa cells with only approximately 100 telomeres indicates that telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance is conserved throughout eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1971960644,"We have previously reported the presence of a hormone-inducible transcriptional activation function (TAF-2) within the region of the estrogen receptor (ER) that contains the hormone binding domain. We show here that the N-terminal A/B region of the ER contains an independent constitutive activation function (TAF-1) that exhibits cell type specificity since it activates transcription efficiently in chicken embryo fibroblasts, but only poorly in HeLa cells. By analyzing the ability of TAF-1, TAF-2, and the GAL4 and VP16 acidic activating domains (AADs) to homosynergize and heterosynergize with one another and with the factor binding to the upstream element (UE) of the adenovirus 2 major late promoter, we show that the activation properties of TAF-1 and TAF-2 are different and distinct from those of AADs, in agreement with the absence of acidic amino acid stretches in TAF-1 and TAF-2."
https://openalex.org/W2013944211,"A 73-kilodalton (kD) intracellular protein was found to bind to peptide regions that target intracellular proteins for lysosomal degradation in response to serum withdrawal. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal antibody raised to a member of the 70-kD heat shock protein (hsp70) family, and sequences of two internal peptides of the 73-kD protein confirm that it is a member of this family. In response to serum withdrawal, the intracellular concentration of the 73-kD protein increased severalfold. In the presence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and MgCl2, the 73-kD protein enhanced protein degradation in two different cell-free assays for lysosomal proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2134818464,"Receptors for interleukin-4 (IL-4) are expressed at low levels on a wide variety of primary cells and cultured cell lines. Fluorescence-activated sorting of CTLL-2 cells resulted in the isolation of a subclone, CTLL 19.4, which expressed 10(6) IL-4 receptors per cell. These cells were used for the purification of IL-4 receptor protein and to prepare a hybrid-subtracted cDNA probe for isolation of cDNA clones. Three classes of IL-4 receptor cDNA were identified. The first encoded a 140 kd membrane bound IL-4 receptor containing extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The second class lacked the cytoplasmic region, and the third encoded a secreted form of the receptor. All cDNA clones expressed in COS-7 cells had IL-4 binding properties comparable to the native IL-4 receptor. The soluble form of the IL-4 receptor blocked the ability of IL-4 to induce CTLL cell proliferation and may represent a regulatory molecule specific for IL-4-dependent immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1996535168,"The basal ganglia, of which the striatum is the major component, process inputs from virtually all cerebral cortical areas to affect motor, emotional, and cognitive behaviors. Insights into how these seemingly disparate functions may be integrated have emerged from studies that have demonstrated that the mammalian striatum is composed of two compartments arranged as a mosaic, the patches and the matrix, which differ in their neurochemical and neuroanatomical properties. In this study, projections from prefrontal, cingulate, and motor cortical areas to the striatal compartments were examined with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) anterograde axonal tracer in rats. Each cortical area projects to both the patches and the matrix of the striatum; however, deep layer V and layer VI corticostriatal neurons project principally to the patches, whereas superficial layer V and layer III and II corticostriatal neurons project principally to the matrix. The relative contribution of patch and matrix corticostriatal projections varies among the cortical areas examined such that allocortical areas provide a greater number of inputs to the patches than to the matrix, whereas the reverse obtains for neocortical areas. These results demonstrate that the compartmental organization of corticostriatal inputs is related to their laminar origin and secondarily to the cytoarchitectonic area of origin."
https://openalex.org/W1987682801,"The four-way junction between DNA helices is the central intermediate in recombination, and the manner of its interaction with resolvase enzymes can determine the genetic outcome of the process. A knowledge of its structure is a prerequisite to understanding the interaction with proteins, and there has been recent progress. Here we use fluorescence energy transfer to determine the relative distances between the ends of a small DNA junction, and hence the path of the strands. Our results are consistent with the geometry of an 'X'. The interconnected helices are juxtaposed so that the continuous strands of each helix generate an antiparallel alignment, and the two interchanged strands do not cross at the centre. The acute angle of the X structure is defined by a right-handed rotation of the helical axes about the axis perpendicular to the X plane, as viewed from the centre of the X."

Given a sufficiently sensitive method for measuring cellular metabolic rates, it should be possible to detect a wide variety of chemical and physical stimuli. A biosensor has been constructed in which living cells are confined to a flow chamber in which a potentiometric sensor continually measures the rate of production of acidic metabolites. Exploratory studies demonstrate several applications of the device in basic science and technology."
https://openalex.org/W2012421057,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major regulator of inflammation and immunity. IL-1 induces T lymphocyte growth by acting as a second signal (together with antigen) in enhancing the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2). An IL-1-responsive element in the promoter region of the human IL-2 gene was similar to the binding site for the transcription factor AP-1. IL-1 enhanced expression of c-jun messenger RNA, whereas the antigenic signal enhanced messenger RNA expression of c-fos. Thus, the two components of the AP-1 factor are independently regulated and the AP-1 factor may serve as a nuclear mediator for the many actions of IL-1 on cells."
https://openalex.org/W1591146532,"Following the example set by studies of the mechanistic aspects of the substrate specificity of various cytochrome P-450 enzymes, we have undertaken a parallel investigation of the soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Soluble methane monooxygenase is a multicomponent enzyme with a broad substrate specificity. Using substrates previously tested with cytochrome P-450 enzymes and using purified enzyme preparations, this work indicates that soluble methane monooxygenase has a similar oxidative reaction mechanism to cytochrome P-450 enzymes. The evidence suggests that soluble methane monooxygenase oxidizes substrates via a nonconcerted reaction mechanism (hydrogen abstraction preceding hydroxylation) with radical or carbocation intermediates. Aromatic hydroxylation proceeds by epoxidation followed by an NIH shift."
https://openalex.org/W1545481155,"Rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells incubated with human serum that has been complement-activated by addition of cobra venom factor reveal a pronounced conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase. This process requires the availability of the fifth component of complement (C5) but not the presence of other components (C2 and C6-C9). The phenomenon can be reproduced by addition to endothelial cells of purified human recombinant C5a but not C5a desArg or C3a. The enzyme conversion process is relatively rapid (occurring within 5-10 min), requires the presence of intact endothelial cells, and does not require protein synthesis. Similar effects on endothelial cells have been obtained with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor a and the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. In contrast, bradykinin, recombinant human interleukin 1β, and phorbol ester lack this biological activity. These findings suggest novel effects of inflammatory mediators on endothelial cells.— Friedl, H. P.; Till, G. O.; Ryan, U. S.; Ward, P. A.

https://openalex.org/W1996902595,Autologous peripheral nerve grafts were used to permit and direct the regrowth of retinal ganglion cell axons from the eye to the ipsilateral superior colliculus of adult hamsters in which the optic nerves had been transected within the orbit. Extracellular recordings in the superior colliculus 15 to 18 weeks after graft insertion revealed excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses to visual stimulation. The finding of light-induced responses in neurons in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus close to the graft indicates that axons regenerating from axotomized retinal ganglion cells can establish electrophysiologically functional synapses with neurons in the superior colliculus of these adult mammals.
https://openalex.org/W1562223547,"CoQ links the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and oxidase components of the cyanide-insensitive, non-cytochrome-mediated respiratory system of bloodstream African trypanosomes. In this and other characteristics, their respiratory system is similar to the alternative oxidase of plants. The parasites contain 206 ng of CoQ9 mg protein−1 which co-sediments with respiratory activity. The redox state of this CoQ responds in a manner consistent with respiratory function: 60% being in the reduced form when substrate is available and the oxidase is blocked; 13% being in the reduced form when the oxidase is functioning and there is no substrate. The addition of CoQ to aceton-extracted cells stimulates salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive respiration by 56%. After inhibition of respiration by digitonin-mediated dispersal of the electron transport components, liposomes restore 40% of respiratory activity while liposomes containing CoQ restore 66% of this activity. A less hydrophobic analogue, reduced decyl CoQ, serves as a direct substrate for the trypanosome oxidase supporting full salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive respiration. After digitonin disruption of electron transport, the nonreduced form of this synthetic substrate can reestablish the chain by accepting electrons from dispersed sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and transferring them to the dispersed oxidase. Similarities between the alternative oxidase of plants and the oxidase of the trypanosome respiratory system include: mitochondrial location, lack of oxidative phosphorylation, linkage of a dehydrogenase and an oxidase by CoQ, lack of sensitivity to a range of mitochondrial inhibotors, and sensitivity to a spectrum of inhibitors which selectively block transfer of electrons from reduced CoQ to the terminal oxidase but do not block electron transfer to the cytochrome bc1 complex of the mammalian cytochrome chain."
https://openalex.org/W1593204115,"Peptidylarginine deiminase (proteinarginine iminohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.15) converted some arginine residues to citrulline residues in soluble vimentin, in a micromolar Ca2+-dependent manner and resulted in the loss of polymerization competence of the intermediate filament protein. When about 8 mol of residues/mol of vimentin were deiminated, there was a complete loss of filament forming ability. This enzyme also deiminated vimentin filaments which had been polymerized, and deimination of vimentin filaments resulted in filament disassembly. Similar results were obtained with other intermediate filaments such as desmin and glial filaments. High performance liquid chromatography and amino acid analyses of lysine-specific protease-generated fragments from deiminated vimentin (about 8 mol of citrulline/mol of vimentin) showed a differential deimination of three structural domains. The head domain was predominant. These observations suggest that the head domain strongly influences integrity of the intermediate filament."
https://openalex.org/W2074855068,"The gene (E2A) that codes for proteins with the properties of immunoglobulin enhancer binding factors E12/E47 was mapped to chromosome region 19p13.2-p13.3, a site associated with nonrandom translocations in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. The majority of t(1;19)(q23;p13)-carrying leukemias and cell lines studied contained rearrangements of E2A as determined by DNA blot analyses. The rearrangements altered the E2A transcriptional unit, resulting in the synthesis of a transcript larger than the normal-sized E2A mRNAs in one of the cell lines with this translocation. These observations indicate that the gene for a transcription factor is located at the breakpoint of a consistently recurring chromosomal translocation in many acute leukemias and suggest a direct role for alteration of such factors in the pathogenesis of some malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1606167220,"The beta-galactoside alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase, an integral membrane protein localized to the trans-region of the Golgi apparatus, has been converted into a catalytically active secreted protein by the replacement of the NH2-terminal signal-anchor domain with the cleavable signal peptide of human gamma-interferon. Pulse-chase analysis of the wild type and recombinant proteins expressed in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that the wild type sialyltransferase (47 kDa) remained cell-associated. In contrast, the signal peptide-sialyltransferase fusion protein yielded an enzymatically active 41-kDa polypeptide which was secreted with a half-time of 2-3 h, consistent with cleavage of the signal peptide. The data indicate that the catalytic domain does not contain sufficient information for retention in the Golgi apparatus and that retention signals are likely to be found in the NH2-terminal 57 amino acids of the wild type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1506002717,"Abstract The DNA sequences involved in control of S14 gene expression in response to carbohydrate have been studied. The levels of S14 mRNA in primary hepatocytes increase when glucose in the media is elevated from 5.5 to 27.7 mM in the presence of insulin. Following lipofection of primary hepatocytes, plasmids containing S14 genomic sequences from -4316 to +19 relative to the start of transcription were sufficient to confer glucose regulation to the linked marker gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Deletions of the S14 sequences between -4316 and -1601 led to a significant reduction in glucose-stimulated activity with each successive deletion, suggesting the presence of multiple regulatory elements. The response of the transfected construct containing 4316 base pairs of S14 5'-flanking region mimicked changes in the endogenous S14 mRNA levels in all hormonal and nutritional conditions tested, supporting the physiological significance of the response."
https://openalex.org/W1566200309,"Abstract We used a stopped-flow method for determining the kinetic properties (between 10 ms and 10 s) of the Ca2+ release induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in saponin-treated rat hepatocytes. Preliminary experiments ensured that the indicator was able to monitor rapid changes in free Ca2+ reliably. At 20 degrees C, a maximally efficient concentration of 10 microM InsP3 released Ca2+ with a half-time of 150-300 ms, the initial rate being about 1-2 nmol of Ca2+/mg of cell protein/s. The delay between the addition of 10 microM InsP3 and the onset of Ca2+ release was shorter than 20 ms, suggesting that the opening process of Ca2+ channels after binding of InsP3 to receptors is completed within a few milliseconds. Half-maximal initial rates for Ca2+ release occurred at about 1 microM InsP3 (Hill index was 1.6). The resulting Ca2+ efflux had a moderate temperature dependence. It could not be fitted to a single exponential. After low speed centrifugation of saponin-treated cells (1000 x g for 1 min), part of the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool was recovered in the cell-free supernatant fraction, suggesting that the response to InsP3 arises from a vesicular fraction which may diffuse from the saponin-treated cells into the medium."

Less stable aberrations including chromatid deletions and gaps were significantly increased only during the application season, but not at this later time point. During fumigant application, measured exposure to phosphine exceeds accepted national standards. Because phosphine is also used as a dopant in the microchip industry and is generated in waste treatment, the possibility of more widespread exposure and long-term health sequelae must be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1562654885,"Human transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) is an initiation factor required for the in vitro transcription of 5 S RNA, tRNA, and adenovirus viral-associated (VA) RNA genes by RNA polymerase III. A TFIIIC activity which complemented purified TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III fractions for VA transcription was highly purified from cultured HeLa cells. This activity copurified through all chromatographic procedures, including B-block oligodeoxynucleotide affinity chromatography, with the two forms of TFIIIC detected by gel mobility shift assays with the VA gene (Hoeffler, W.K., Kovelman, R., and Roeder, R.G. (1988) Cell 53, 907–920). Both specific binding activity to the VAI gene and TFIIIC transcription activity were inhibited by the alkylating agents diisopropyl fluorophosphate, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and N-ethylmaleimide, and to a lesser extent by N α-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, whereas neither activity was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. These data suggest further that the DNA binding and transcription assays scored the same protein(s). TPCK and N-ethylmaleimide inactivated TFIIIC solely through thiol group modification, since prior modification with the reversible thiol reagent 2,2′-dithiopyridine prevented permanent inactivation. The involvement of reduced thiol groups in the specific binding of TFIIIC to the VAI gene was further indicated by an increase in TFIIIC binding activity upon addition of dithiothreitol. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that a Mr = 126,000 polypeptide both eluted from a B-block oligodeoxynucleotide affinity column with the DNA binding and transcription activities of TFIIIC and was specifically cross-linked by UV to a 5-bromo-2-deoxynucleotide-substituted B-block oligodeoxynucleotide. The near identity of the TFIIIC molecular weight determined by gel filtration on SOTA Phase GF 200 (Mr = 140,000) suggests that TFIIIC in solution (in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl at pH 7.0) consists of a single polypeptide which is fairly globular in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1596204790,"In addition to its cytotoxic/cytostatic action on many tumor cells in vitro, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was recently shown to stimulate the growth of some types of cells in culture. We examined the action of TNF in BALB/c 3T3 cells which have been used extensively to study growth regulation. In subconfluent, rapidly dividing 3T3 cultures, murine (Mu) TNF was cytotoxic, while human (Hu) TNF had virtually no antiproliferative action on the cells. In contrast, in density-arrested BALB/c 3T3 cells maintained in a chemically defined, serum-free medium, MuTNF produced a dose-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis. In stimulating DNA synthesis, MuTNF acted synergistically with both epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor. While stimulating DNA synthesis in quiescent 3T3 cultures, high doses of MuTNF (100 or 10 ng/ml) were also cytotoxic for a portion of the cells in the same cultures. Cytotoxicity was apparent 2 h after the addition of MuTNF, well before the onset of DNA synthesis. BALB/c 3T3 cell variants selected for their resistance to the cytotoxic action of MuTNF retained the capacity to respond to the mitogenic action of MuTNF, indicating that the stimulation of DNA synthesis by TNF is not a consequence of a TNF wounding effect. Addition of TNF to density-arrested 3T3 cells resulted in the release of free arachidonic acid and palmitic acid from the cells. Quinacrine, a phospholipase inhibitor, inhibited both cytotoxicity and DNA synthesis in response to TNF, and melittin, a phospholipase activator, mimicked both the cytotoxic and mitogenic actions of TNF in quiescent BALB/c 3T3 cells. These results suggest that phospholipid breakdown is part of the essential early signal transduction events required both for the cytotoxic and mitogenic response to TNF action."
https://openalex.org/W1556893777,"Contraction-induced translocation of protein kinase C (Richter E.A., Cleland, P.J.F., Rattigan, S., and Clark, M.G. (1987) FEBS Lett. 217, 232-236) implies a role for this enzyme in muscle contraction or the associated metabolic adjustments. In the present study, this role is further examined particularly in relation to changes in glucose transport. Electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve of the anesthetized rat in vivo led to a time-dependent translocation of protein kinase C and a 2-fold increase in the concentrations of both diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. Maximum values for the latter were reached at 2 min and preceded the maximum translocation of protein kinase C (10 min). Stimulation of muscles in vitro increased the rate of glucose transport, but this required 20 min to reach maximum. There was no reversal of translocation or decrease in the concentrations of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid even after 30 min of rest following a 5-min period of stimulation in vivo. Translocation was not influenced by variations in applied load at maximal fiber recruitment but was dependent on the frequency of nontetanic stimuli, reaching a maximum at 4 Hz. The relationship between protein kinase C and glucose transport was also explored by varying the number of tetanic stimuli. Whereas only one train of stimuli (200 ms, 100 Hz) was required for maximal effects on protein kinase C, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidic acid, more than 35 trains of stimuli were required to activate glucose transport. It is concluded that the production of diacylglycerol and the translocation of protein kinase C may be causally related. However, if the translocated protein kinase C is involved in the activation of glucose transport during muscle contractions, an accumulated exposure to Ca2+, resulting from multiple contractions, would appear to be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2166283735,"Abstract We have developed a method to quantify (6-4) photoproducts in genes and other specific sequences within the genome. This approach utilizes the following two enzymes from Escherichia coli: ABC excinuclease, a versatile DNA repair enzyme which recognizes many types of lesions in DNA, and DNA photolyase, which reverts pyrimidine dimers. DNA is isolated from UV irradiated Chinese hamster ovary cells and digested with a restriction enzyme. Pyrimidine dimers, the major photoproduct produced at biological UV fluences, are then completely repaired by treatment with DNA photolyase. The photoreactivated DNA is treated with ABC excinuclease, electrophoresed in an alkaline agarose gel, transferred to a support membrane and probed for specific genomic sequences. Net incisions produced by ABC excinuclease following photoreactivation are largely due to the presence of (6-4) photoproducts. These adducts are quantitated by measuring the reduction of intensity of the full length fragments on the autoradiogram. Using this approach we have shown that (6-4) photoproducts are produced at equal frequency in the dihydrofolate reductase coding sequence and in its 3'-flanking, noncoding sequences and that the formation of (6-4) photoproducts is linear in both sequences up to a UV dose of 60 J/m2. The repair of (6-4) photoproducts in these DNA sequences was measured after a dose of 40 J/m2 over 4-, 8-, and 24-h time periods. The (6-4) photoproducts are repaired more efficiently than pyrimidine dimers in both sequences and there is preferential repair of (6-4) photoproducts in the dihydrofolate reductase gene compared with the downstream, noncoding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1554966787,"Oxygen equilibrium curves of human hemoglobin Ao (HbAo) and human hemoglobin cross-linked between the α chains (α α Hb) by bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl) fumarate were measured as a function of pH and chloride or organic phosphate concentration. Compared to HbAo, the oxygen affinity of α α Hb was lower, cooperativity was maintained, although slightly reduced, and all heterotropic effects were diminished. The major effect of α α-cross-linking appears to be a reduction of the oxygen affinity of R-state hemoglobin under all conditions. However, while the oxygen affinity of T-state α α Hb was slightly reduced at physiologic chloride concentration and in the absence of organic phosphates, KT was the same for both hemoglobins in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (or high salt) and higher for α α Hb in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate. The reduced O2 affinity arises from smaller binding constants for both T- and R-state α α Hb rather than through stabilization of the low affinity conformation. All four Adair constants could be determined for α α Hb under most conditions, but a3 could not be resolved for HbAo without constraining a4, suggesting that the cross-link stabilizes triply ligated intermediates of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1556798853,"Abstract Steroid 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities reside within the same polypeptide chain (cytochrome P-450(17 alpha)), and consequently human 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiencies are characterized by defects in either or both of these activities. Human mutants having these deficiencies represent an excellent source of material for investigation of P-450(17 alpha) structure-function relationships. The CYP17 gene from an individual having partial combined 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency has been characterized structurally and the homozygous mutation found to be the deletion of the phenylalanine codon (TTC) at either amino acid position 53 or 54 in exon 1. Reconstruction of this mutation into a human P-450(17 alpha) cDNA followed by expression in COS 1 cells led to production of the same amount of immunodetectable P-450(17 alpha) protein as found with expression of the normal human P-450(17 alpha) cDNA. However, 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity of this mutant protein measured in intact cells was less than 37% of that observed upon expression of the wild-type enzyme, whereas 17,20-lyase activity of the mutant was less than 8% of that observed with the normal enzyme. When estimated in intact cells, the Km for 17 alpha-hydroxylation of progesterone was increased by a factor of 2 in the mutant enzyme, whereas the Vmax was reduced by a factor of 3. In order to estimate the kinetic parameters for the 17,20-lyase reaction, microsomes were isolated from transfected COS 1 cells to enrich for this activity. Surprisingly, the specific activity of the mutant 17 alpha-hydroxylase in microsomes was 3-fold less than that observed in intact cells, indicating that the structure of mutant P-450(17 alpha) was dramatically altered upon disruption of COS 1 cells. Apparently the deletion of a single phenylalanine in the N-terminal region of P-450(17 alpha) alters its folding in such a way that both enzymatic activities are dramatically decreased, leading to the partial combined deficiency observed in this individual."
https://openalex.org/W1600718168,"We reported previously the purification of a 165-kDa muscle-specific protein identified by virtue of its ability to bind 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein with high affinity after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Hoffmann, S. L., Brown, M. S., Lee, E., Pathak, R. K., Anderson, R. G. W., and Goldstein, J. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8260-8270). The protein is located in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where it has no access to plasma lipoproteins. It binds to 45Ca2+ on nitrocellulose blots and stains metachromatically blue with Stains-all, a cationic dye that stains Ca2+-binding proteins. In the current paper, we have isolated a full-length rabbit cDNA clone for the 165-kDa protein. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals a 852-amino acid protein with the following structural features: 1) an NH2-terminal 27-residue putative signal sequence; 2) a highly repetitive region containing nine nearly identical tandem repeats of 29 residues, each consisting of a histidine-rich sequence HRHRGH, a stretch of 10-11 acidic amino acids, and a sequence containing 2 serines and a threonine in a negatively charged context; 3) a 13-residue stretch of polyglutamic acid; and 4) a COOH-terminal cluster of 14 closely spaced cysteine residues with the repeating pattern of Cys-X-X-Cys suggestive of a heavy metal binding domain. Histidine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid accounted, respectively, for 13, 12, and 19% of the amino acids. The protein does not share any significant sequence homology with the cell surface low density lipoprotein receptor. Stretches of acidic amino acids are a feature of two other luminal sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins, suggesting that these may be a general feature of luminal sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins. We suggest that the histidine-rich Ca2+-binding protein described in the current study be designated HCP. The role of HCP in Ca2+ homeostasis in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal and cardiac muscle remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1575089176,"To examine how vimentin assembles into the cytoskeletons of cultured cells, we used pulse labeling with [35S]methionine, cell fractionation with Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody that binds both nascent and full-length vimentin polypeptides. In embryonic muscle cells, fibroblasts, and erythroid cells, we find two populations of newly synthesized vimentin. One population is found on the cytoskeleton immediately after a 2-min pulse with labeled methionine; the other is delayed in its association with the cytoskeleton and has a measurable rate of disappearance from the extractable pool. This rate varies with cell type, being over 3-fold faster in muscle and fibroblast cells than in erythroid cells. By using [3H]puromycin to specifically label nascent chains, we detect nascent vimentin chains that are bound to the cytoskeleton independently of ribosomes. The fraction of newly synthesized, full-length vimentin that associates with the cytoskeleton immediately correlates in these cell types with the fraction of nascent vimentin chains that are not released from the cytoskeleton by puromycin, RNase, or 0.6 M NaCl. Over one-half of the newly synthesized vimentin associates immediately in muscle and fibroblasts, whereas this value is less than 15% in erythroid cells. These data suggest that the process of vimentin assembly may vary both kinetically and mechanistically in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1569421266,"Laminin, a major basement membrane glycoprotein, interacts with many basement membrane- and cell surface-associated heparin-like macromolecules. In order to understand these interactions better, we have tried to map heparin-binding sites on laminin precisely. Electron microscopy revealed three major heparin-binding sites: 1) on the globule of the long arm; 2) on the outer globule of the short arms; and 3) on the inner globule of the short arms. Elution of heparin bound to a laminin affinity column with a linear salt gradient produced three peaks at 0.15, 0.17, and 0.20 M NaCl. When the laminin-heparin interaction was examined in the presence of increasing salt concentrations by the technique of rotary shadowing, the weakest binding was assigned to the inner globule of the short arms and the strongest to the globule of the long arm. One peptide termed AC15, with the sequence Arg-Ile-Gln-Asn-Leu-Leu-Lys-Ile-Thr-Asn-Leu-Arg-Ile-Lys-Phe-Val-Lys from the B1 chain, was identified as a heparin-binding sequence localized on the outer globule of the lateral short arm. Because the two stronger heparin-binding sites were mapped in domains participating in laminin self-association, the effect of heparin on this phenomenon was examined using turbidity and electron microscopy. At low heparin concentrations, laminin oligomer and polymer formation was slightly enhanced. At high heparin concentrations, a drastic inhibition of polymerization was observed, and laminin was detected to be mainly monomeric in rotary-shadowed samples. These results suggest that local variation in the concentration of heparin-like macromolecules might be a crucial factor in determining the association of matrix macromolecules and therefore the structure of basement membranes."

Until now, the basic biochemical defect in this disorder has remained uncertain. In this report, the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of sialic acid has been measured directly in whole cell lysates by a highly sensitive assay. With this technique, the basic defect in sialuria has been identified unequivocally as the loss of feedback control of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase by cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid with resultant overproduction of sialic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1567342686,"The glutathione S-transferases are a family of dimeric enzymes that catalyze the reaction between GSH and a variety of electrophiles. Two closely related isozymes, referred to as YaYa and YcYc, were purified from rat liver. A radiolabeled azido derivative of glutathione (S-(p-azidophenacyl)[3H]glutathione) was prepared and used to label covalently the active site of the above two glutathione S-transferases. The noncovalently bound affinity label was a competitive inhibitor of glutathione S-transferase YaYa toward both 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and GSH. The covalently labeled enzymes no longer bound to a GSH-affinity column, and covalent labeling was reduced in the presence of GSH and S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione. These results suggest that the affinity label was binding at the active site. The covalently labeled enzymes were digested with trypsin, and the labeled peptides were purified by HPLC and then sequenced. A single-labeled peptide was identified in the tryptic digest of the YaYa isozyme, whereas two labeled peptides were present in the tryptic digest of YcYc. The Ya peptide sequence was identical with the published deduced sequence of amino acids between residues 212 and 218 and the sequences of the two peptides purified from Yc were identical with the deduced sequence of amino acids between 91 and 110 and 206 and 218. Hence, the Ya peptide and the smaller peptide purified from Yc came from the same region of the Ya and Yc subunits. This common region and a second region of the Yc subunit appear to form a portion of the active site of these two forms of glutathione S-transferase."
https://openalex.org/W1542183560,"Nonspecific cross-reacting antigen-2 (NCA-2) is a glycoprotein purified from meconium as a closely correlated entity with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). As in the case of CEA, only asparagine-linked sugar chains are included in NCA-2. In order to elucidate the structural characteristics of the sugar chains of NCA-2, they were quantitatively released from the polypeptide backbone by hydrazinolysis and reduced with NaB3H4 after N-acetylation. The radioactive oligosaccharides were fractionated by paper electrophoresis, serial chromatography on immobilized lectin columns, and Bio-Gel P-4 (under 400 mesh) column chromatography. Structures of the oligosaccharides were estimated from the data of the binding specificities of immobilized lectin columns and the effective size of each oligosaccharide determined by passing through a Bio-Gel P-4 column and were then confirmed by endo-beta-galactosidase digestion, sequential digestion with exoglycosidases with different aglycon specificities, and methylation analysis. NCA-2 contains a similar number (27 mol) of sugar chains in one molecule compared with CEA (24-26 mol). However, all sugar chains of NCA-2 were complex-type in contrast to CEA, approximately 8% of the sugar chains of which were high mannose-type (Yamashita, K., Totani, K., Kuroki, M., Matsuoka, Y., Ueda, I., and Kobata, A. (1987) Cancer Res. 47, 3451-3459). About 80% of the oligosaccharides from NCA-2 contain bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues, and the percent molar ratio of mono-, bi, tri, and tetraantennary oligosaccharides was 2:14:57:27.

https://openalex.org/W1593145318,"2-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate was covalently linked, through a diazo bond, to Sepharose 4B, which had been elongated with a hydrophobic spacer. A Triton X-100 extract from bovine heart mitochondria was pre-purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography and passed through the 2-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate affinity resin in the presence of 0.7% deoxycholate. At pH 6 and in the presence of 0.2 M sodium chloride, a single polypeptide with an Mr of 34,000 was eluted. Subsequently, at pH 8 and in the presence of 2-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, another single protein with an Mr of 31,500 was released. Both proteins were reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and their transport activities were measured. High, delta pH-dependent, 2-cyanocinnamate-sensitive pyruvate uptake was measured in vesicles containing only the 34-kDa protein. alpha-Ketobutyrate and other alpha-ketomonocarboxylic acids were competitive inhibitors of the pyruvate uptake, whereas di- and tricarboxylates had only small effects. alpha-Ketoglutarate-alpha-ketoglutarate exchange could only be measured in vesicles containing the 31.5-kDa protein. The molecular weight of this protein and its functional properties were similar to those of the alpha-ketoglutarate carrier isolated by a different method (Bisaccia, Indiveri, C., and Palmieri, F. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 810, 362-369). 2-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate inhibited the alpha-ketoglutarate exchange in a noncompetitive manner with an apparent Ki of 0.7 mM. It is concluded that by the described affinity chromatography procedure, two mitochondrial carriers transporting alpha-ketoacids, i.e. the monocarboxylate and the alpha-ketoglutarate carrier, could be purified in a functionally active state."
https://openalex.org/W1560492110,"We describe, for the first time, an intron that is located in the variable loop of a tRNA. It is 18 nucleotides long and occurs within a precursor tRNAGly from the extreme thermophile Thermofilum pendens. The variable loop is less critical for tRNA function than the anticodon arm where other class III introns occur. This raises the possibility that tRNAs with a large variable loop (type II) arose from those with a small variable loop (type I) by retaining a splicing-deficient intron."
https://openalex.org/W1502935738,"The binding kinetics of 125I-labeled mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF) to receptors on human fibroblast cells in monolayer culture were measured at 4 degrees C. Initial binding rates as a function of hormone concentration allowed estimation of simple two-state on-off rate constants of 1.2 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 and 4.9 x 10(-3) s-1, respectively. These two-state parameters gave inadequate computer fits to long term kinetic and equilibrium-binding data, suggesting that an additional process(es) was occurring. Nonlinear equilibrium Scatchard plots and transient pseudo-Scatchard plots taken at pre-equilibrium times support the idea that at least one other process is occurring during receptor binding. 125I-EGF-receptor dissociation kinetic plots were biphasic, yielding rate constants of 1.5 x 10(-2) s-1 and 5.6 x 10(-5) s-1 with the ratio of the two components changing with the time of initial incubation with 125I-EGF. Application of a ternary complex model which assumed complexation of the bound receptor with a cell surface interaction molecule gave satisfactory fits to all data."
https://openalex.org/W1572597841,"Pregnenolone synthesis from cholesterol by adrenal mitochondria isolated from ether-stressed rats exhibits a biphasic time course: upon the addition of a reducing substrate (e.g. malate), a rapid phase of pregnenolone formation occurs during the first 5 min, which has been interpreted as the metabolism of a steroidogenic pool of cholesterol, probably in the inner membrane. A slower rate follows, which is interpreted as translocation of cholesterol into the steroidogenic pool. While a 30-min preincubation of mitochondria with cholesterol alone did not affect the extent of the rapid phase, preincubation with GTP plus cholesterol extended the first phase, resulting in an up to 2-fold increase in pregnenolone synthesis by 20-30 min. The apparent Km for GTP was 0.1-0.4 mM, and stimulation was maximal with preincubation times of 10-30 min, depending upon incubation conditions. Exogenous cholesterol was not required to observe a stimulatory effect, indicating that GTP reorganizes the endogenous mitochondrial cholesterol pools. Nevertheless, stimulation was greater when exogenous cholesterol was provided, consistent with enhanced utilization of both endogenous and exogenous cholesterol. Stimulation by GTP was also seen in mitochondria isolated from cycloheximide-injected/ether-stressed rats, although the activity in these preparations was always lower than that in mitochondria from ether-stressed rats. The stimulation was specific for GTP, since many other nucleotides (e.g. ATP, GDP, and ITP) and GTP analogues (guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate and guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate) had no effect. The GTP-activated state was reversible: after GTP hydrolysis by a mitochondrial GTPase, pregnenolone synthesis returned to the basal level. Sonic disruption of mitochondria abolished the stimulatory effect of GTP. These results suggest that GTP enhances pregnenolone synthesis by promoting the movement of cholesterol to the steroidogenic pool, consistent with a recently proposed general role for GTP in some vectorial transport processes (Bourne, H. R. (1988) Cell 53, 669-671)."
https://openalex.org/W1581595804,"Abstract NIH-3T3 cells expressing the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor were used in experiments to determine the fate of the EGF receptor in cells continuously exposed to EGF. EGF receptor was immunoprecipitated from cells labeled for 12 h with [35S] methionine in the absence or presence of 10 nM EGF. As expected, a single Mr = 170,000 polypeptide representing the mature EGF receptor was immune-precipitated from control cells. Surprisingly, immune precipitates from EGF-treated cells contained a prominent Mr = 125,000 receptor species, in addition to the Mr = 170,000 mature receptor. The Mr = 125,000 species was shown to be derived from the Mr = 170,000 form by pulse-chase experiments, in which the Mr = 170,000 receptor chased into the Mr = 125,000 form when EGF was included during the chase and by partial proteolysis. Both proteins became extensively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in immune precipitate kinase assays. Treatment of immune precipitates with endoglycosidase F changed the apparent molecular weight of the Mr = 170,000 receptor to Mr = 130,000 and of the Mr = 125,000 form to Mr = 105,000, indicating that the appearance of the Mr = 125,000 protein was probably due to proteolysis. Antibody against the carboxyl terminus of the mature EGF receptor recognized the Mr = 125,000 protein, whereas antibody against the amino terminus did not. Incubation of cells with leupeptin prior to and during EGF addition inhibited processing to the Mr = 125,000 species. Methylamine and low temperature also inhibited the EGF-induced processing to the Mr = 125,000 form. These data suggest a possible role for proteolysis of the EGF receptor in receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1488213334,"Abstract Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone that has a variety of physiologically important functions in the gastrointestinal tract, in which distinct high affinity receptors have been identified. We describe here the purification of the digitonin-solubilized rat pancreatic receptor as an initial step in the determination of its primary structure. Solubilization of total pancreatic membranes using 1% digitonin resulted in a single class of binding sites with a specific content of 4 pmol/mg as measured in a soluble binding assay using the nonpeptidyl CCK antagonist [3H]3S[-]-N-[2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepine-3-yl]-1H-indole-2-carboxamide [( 3H]364,718). The solubilized receptor was purified using the following chromatographic steps: 1) cation exchange; 2) Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I-agarose; and 3) Sephacryl S-300. The final preparation of the purified receptor had a specific content of 8,055 pmol/mg, which represented a 9,051-fold purification from intact membranes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified receptor preparation under reducing conditions resulted in a predominant polypeptide with an Mr = 85,000-95,000 and minor polypeptides of Mr = 57,000 and 26,000 as determined by radiolabeling and silver staining. Solubilized pancreatic membranes were affinity labeled with the peptidyl CCK agonist 125I-D-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31,6-NO2-Phe33)CCK-26-33] and chromatographed under conditions similar to those described for untreated membranes. Elution of radioactive peaks from each chromatographic column was coincident with [3H]364,718 binding activity and resulted in a labeled polypeptide having the same electrophoretic mobility as receptor derived from freshly labeled membranes and purified from untreated membranes. High performance liquid-gel exclusion chromatography of the crude digitonin-solubilized membrane preparation revealed an estimated molecular size for the [3H]364,718-binding activity of 370,000, which was consistent with the size determined by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of the purified receptor complexed with the labeled nonpeptidyl antagonist. Binding of [3H]364,718 to the purified receptor preparation was comparable to that observed with the crude solubilized pancreatic membrane preparation; and both the homologous ligand 364,718 (Ki = 0.5 nm) and CCK-8 (Ki = 1.4 microM) competed for binding to both preparations in a similar manner."
https://openalex.org/W1589402837,"Abstract Two peptides exhibiting kinin activity in an isolated rat uterus assay were purified from pasteurized skim bovine milk. The amino acid sequence of the more prominent peptide was found to be that of bradykinin. Partially purified kinin preparations were also obtained from N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin digests of non-fat dry milk and insoluble lactalbumin. The application of fast atom bombardment/mass spectrometry permitted detection of the bradykinin protonated molecular ion in each of these samples. Collision-activated decomposition of the ion of m/z 1061 confirmed it to be the protonated molecular ion of bradykinin. Fast atom bombardment/mass spectrometry analysis further confirmed the occurrence of bradykinin in a pancreatic kallikrein digest of a partially purified bovine milk kininogen preparation. In apparent contrast with bovine plasma kininogens, the forms of kininogen which occur in milk include a high Mr kininogen (Mr greater than 68,000) and a low Mr kininogen (Mr 16,000-17,000). Kinin formation from the high Mr kininogen is catalyzed by porcine pancreatic kallikrein or trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1582753604,"Abstract When methionine beta(55)D6 in human hemoglobin is oxidized to its sulfoxide derivative, the modified protein appears to maintain most of the chemical and structural properties typical of the native protein. On the contrary, the functional behavior is drastically changed, being characterized (like that of the isolated chains) by high oxygen affinity (p50 = 0.47 torr in 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.3) + 0.1 M NaCl at 25 degrees C), absence of cooperativity (n = 1), and lack of Bohr effect. The complete destabilization of the T-state as a result of this modification is related to a perturbation of the alpha 1 beta 1 subunit interface, which in native hemoglobin remains static during the quaternary ligand-linked transition. Results also suggest that methionyl sulfoxide-containing hemoglobin, obtained under different conditions, assumes functionally different R-states, none of which is exactly comparable with that typical of the native protein."
https://openalex.org/W161152063,"Recombinant human interleukin-1β (rIL-1β) was chemically modified by a 10-fold molar excess (reagent:protein) of sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin) or sulfosuccinimidobiotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin) under mild conditions. The primary product was purified in each case by cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and digested with endoproteinase Lys C. Peptide mapping by C18 reverse phase HPLC permitted identification of three sites of biotinylation using both reagents; N-terminal alanine, lysine 93, and lysine 94. Few additional singly modified rIL-1β products were obtained under these conditions, despite the presence of 15 lysine residues in this protein. These data support the view that the N terminus as well as the trilysine sequence (residues 92–94) are readily susceptible to chemical modification and are exposed on the surface of the protein. Chromatography of intact biotinylated rIL-1β by C4 reverse phase HPLC resolved a protein modified exclusively at the N-terminal alanine from two proteins modified singly at either lysine 93 or lysine 94. In addition, a protein product modified at lysine 103 was also obtained when rIL-1β was similarly modified with sulfo-NHS-biotin. Since the only difference between the two biotinylation reagents relates to spacer length and its associated hydrophobicity, these data suggest that lysine 103 is not as accessible to surface modification reagents as are lysine 93, lysine 94, or alanine 1. Initial experiments indicate that none of the modifications described above decrease thymocyte proliferation by more than one order of magnitude. Therefore, these amino acid residues are not crucial for bioactivity, and we anticipate the use of these monobiotinylated proteins in structure/function analysis of IL-1β."
https://openalex.org/W1576157631,"Abstract The spectral shift from 420 to 338 nm when pure bacterial D-amino acid transaminase binds D-amino acid substrates is also exhibited in part by high concentrations of L-amino acids (L-alanine and L-glutamate) but not by simple dicarboxylic acids or monoamines. Slow processing of L-alanine to D-alanine was observed both by coupled enzymatic assays using D-amino acid oxidase and by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis employing an optically active chromophore (Marfey's reagent). When the acceptor for L-alanine was alpha-ketoglutarate, D-glutamate was also formed. This minor activity of the transaminase involved both homologous (L-alanine and D-alanine) and heterologous (L-alanine and D-glutamate) substrate pairs and was a function of the nature of the keto acid acceptor. In the presence of alpha-ketoisovalerate, DL-alanine was almost completely processed to D-valine; within the limits of the assay no L-valine was detected. With alpha-ketoisocaproate, 90% of the DL-alanine was converted to D-leucine. In the mechanism of this transaminase reaction, there may be more stereoselective constraints for the protonation of the quinonoid intermediate during the second half-reaction of the transamination reaction, i.e. the donation of the amino group from the pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate coenzyme to a second keto acid acceptor, than during removal of the alpha proton in the initial steps of the reaction pathway. Thus, with this D-amino acid transaminase, the discrete steps of transamination ensure fidelity of the stereospecificity of reaction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1501849109,"Erythrocyte protein 4.1 is a cytoplasmic protein that possesses a protein-saccharide modification structure, an O-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety. We determined the amino acid sequence of the proteolytic fragment containing the O-GlcNAc moiety after labeling the saccharide with [3H]galactose in the presence of bovine milk galactosyltransferase. Glycosylation appears to occur on one or more serine or threonine residues in the following sequence: Thr-Ala-Gln-Thr-Ile-Thr-Ser-Glu-Thr-Pro-Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr-Thr-Thr-Gln-Ile-Thr-Lys. This sequence corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal half of the 34-amino acid peptide in the 22/24-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain of protein 4.1, which is one of the discrete peptides regulated by alternative RNA splicing. Multiple protein 4.1 isoforms in erythroid and nonerythroid cells including major components of erythrocyte membrane proteins, 4.1a and 4.1b, appear to contain this sequence since most immunochemically reactive proteins were labeled with [3H]galactose, with the exception of several variant polypeptides. These results appear to suggest the functional or biological significance of the O-GlcNAc linkage in protein 4.1."
https://openalex.org/W1842756070,"Diphtheria toxin (DT) is a soluble protein that translocates across hydrophobic lipid bilayers in response to low pH. The translocation activity of DT has been localized to the 40-kDa toxin B chain and can be expressed independently of the C-terminal receptor binding site. Buried hydrophobic domains in DT are thought to participate in the membrane translocation process. We have identified a mutant form of DT, CRM 102, that has a point mutation at position 308 (Pro----Ser) within one of these hydrophobic domains. CRM 102 conjugated to a monoclonal antibody against the T cell receptor, the transferrin receptor, or transferrin itself is approximately 10-fold less toxic than native DT or a control DT mutant, CRM 103, linked to the same binding moieties. Direct measurement of membrane translocation activity by exposure of cells to low extracellular pH demonstrates that CRM 102 conjugates express only 10% of the translocation activity of the control toxin conjugates. However, when CRM 102 or 102 conjugates bind and kill cells via the DT receptor, no reduction in membrane translocation activity is observed. The defect in CRM 102 is not evident in the presence of 20 mM NH4Cl. The defect in translocation also has no effect on the ratio of the lag time before protein synthesis inhibition begins to the rate of protein synthesis inhibition. Thus, the proline-serine substitution at position 308 disrupts the membrane translocation process and distinguishes between two routes of DT entry: DT receptor-mediated entry and entry mediated by alternate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1603923723,"The transfer of retinoic acid, retinyl acetate, and retinyl palmitate between single unilamellar vesicles was studied by resonance energy transfer. The retinoic acid transfers spontaneously between single unilamellar vesicles with a first order rate constant of 9.6 s-1 at 15 degrees C and pH 7.4. At 30 degrees C, the transfer rate was 3.5 times faster than that at 10 degrees C. At pH 7.4, the transfer rate was almost 2 orders of magnitude faster than that observed at pH 1.6. Increasing the concentration of NaCl decreased the retinoic acid transfer rate significantly. Retinyl acetate transfers with a rate constant of 0.15 s-1, but no spontaneous transfer of retinyl palmitate was observed over 60 min. The evidence supports the proposal that retinoic acid and retinyl acetate transfer between single unilamellar vesicles occur via the aqueous phase. In contrast, no spontaneous transfer of retinyl palmitate was observed. However, linear free energy relationships and the thermodynamic parameters for retinyl acetate transfer permit the calculation of rate constant for retinyl palmitate transfer."
