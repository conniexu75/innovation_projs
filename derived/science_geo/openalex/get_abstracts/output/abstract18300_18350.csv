https://openalex.org/W2137839040,"Manganese oxidation by manganese peroxidase (MnP) was investigated. Stoichiometric, kinetic, and MnII binding studies demonstrated that MnP has a single manganese binding site near the heme, and two MnIII equivalents are formed at the expense of one H2O2 equivalent. Since each catalytic cycle step is irreversible, the data fit a peroxidase ping-pong mechanism rather than an ordered bi-bi ping-pong mechanism. MnIII-organic acid complexes oxidize terminal phenolic substrates in a second-order reaction. MnIII-lactate and -tartrate also react slowly with H2O2, with third-order kinetics. The latter slow reaction does not interfere with the rapid MnP oxidation of phenols. Oxalate and malonate are the only organic acid chelators secreted by the fungus in significant amounts. No relationship between stimulation of enzyme activity and chelator size was found, suggesting that the substrate is free MnII rather than a MnII-chelator complex. The enzyme competes with chelators for free MnII. Optimal chelators, such as malonate, facilitate MnIII dissociation from the enzyme, stabilize MnIII in aqueous solution, and have a relatively low MnII binding constant."
https://openalex.org/W1549544590,"We have recently shown that changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kDa protein(s) (pp130) may be involved in integrin signaling (Kornberg, L., Earp, H.S., Turner, C., Prokop, and Juliano, R. L. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 8392-8396). One component of the pp130 protein complex reacts with an antibody generated against p125fak, which is a focal contact-associated tyrosine kinase (Schaller, M.D., Borgman, C. A., Cobb, B. S., Vines, R. R., Reynolds, A. B., and Parsons, J. T. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 5192-5196). Both antibody-mediated integrin clustering and adhesion of KB cells to fibronectin leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak. The phosphorylation of p125fak is coincident with adhesion of cells to fibronectin and is maximal prior to cell spreading. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak is induced when KB cells are allowed to adhere to fibronectin, collagen type IV, or laminin, but is not induced on polylysine. When KB cells are subjected to indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, p125fak colocalizes with talin in focal contacts. These data provide additional evidence that tyrosine kinases are involved in integrin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1606157168,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and interleukin (IL)-10 inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage production of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta by contrasting post-transcriptional mechanisms. TGF-beta acted slowly and late, as it required 12-16 h to exert a suppressive effect, and inhibited TNF production even when added 6 h after LPS. TGF-beta affected neither the level of TNF mRNA, the release of preformed TNF nor the degradation of TNF. Thus, TGF-beta appeared to inhibit translation of TNF mRNA. IL-10 not only suppressed TNF release to a 25-fold greater extent than TGF-beta, but also inhibited release of IL-1. In contrast to TGF-beta, IL-10 acted on an early step in cytokine production, its effect being maximal 3 h after addition of LPS. Unlike TGF-beta, IL-10 markedly suppressed TNF, IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta mRNA levels. However, this was accomplished without suppressing transcription of the corresponding genes. Moreover, cycloheximide antagonized the IL-10-dependent reduction in cytokine mRNA levels. Thus, IL-10 may induce a ribonuclease active on cytokine transcripts or may induce a protein that enhances the susceptibility of TNF, IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta mRNAs to ribonucleolytic action. We conclude that IL-10 and TGF-beta induce different phenotypes of macrophage deactivation, and deactivate macrophages by different mechanisms: IL-10 promotes degradation of cytokine mRNA, while TGF-beta primarily suppresses translation."
https://openalex.org/W1604834232,"Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) consist of a nucleotide-binding alpha subunit and a high-affinity complex of beta and gamma subunits. There is molecular heterogeneity of beta and gamma, but the significance of this diversity is poorly understood. Different G protein beta and gamma subunits have been expressed both singly and in combinations in Sf9 cells. Although expression of individual subunits is achieved in all cases, beta gamma subunit activity (support of pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of rGi alpha 1) is detected only when beta and gamma are expressed concurrently. Of the six combinations of beta gamma tested (beta 1 or beta 2 with gamma 1, gamma 2, or gamma 3), only one, beta 2 gamma 1, failed to generate a functional complex. Each of the other five complexes has been purified by subunit exchange chromatography using Go alpha-agarose as the chromatographic matrix. We have detected differences in the abilities of the purified proteins to support ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha 1; these differences are attributable to the gamma component of the complex. When assayed for their ability to inhibit calmodulin-stimulated type-I adenylylcyclase activity or to potentiate Gs alpha-stimulated type-II adenylylcyclase, recombinant beta 1 gamma 1 and transducin beta gamma are approximately 10 and 20 times less potent, respectively, than the other complexes examined. Prenylation and/or further carboxyl-terminal processing of gamma are not required for assembly of the beta gamma subunit complex but are indispensable for high affinity interactions of beta gamma with either G protein alpha subunits or adenylylcyclases."
https://openalex.org/W1515000724,"Type IX collagen functions in covalent cross-linkage to type II collagen in cartilage (Eyre, D. R., Apone, S., Wu, J. J., Ericsson, L. H., and Walsh, K. A. (1987) FEBS Lett. 220, 337-341). To understand this molecular relationship better, an analysis of all cross-linking sites labeled by [3H]borohydride was undertaken using the protein prepared from fetal bovine cartilage. Sequence analysis of tryptic peptides containing the 3H-labeled cross-links showed that each of the chains of type IX collagen, alpha 1(IX), alpha 2(IX), and alpha 3(IX), contained a site of cross-linking at the amino terminus of the COL2 triple-helix to which the alpha 1(II)N-telopeptide could bond. The alpha 3(IX)COL2 domain alone also had an attachment site for the alpha 1(II)C-telopeptide. The distance between the alpha 1(II)N-telopeptide and alpha 1(II)C-telopeptide interaction sites, 137 residues, is equal to the length of the hole zone (0.6D) in a type II collagen fibril. This implies an antiparallel type II to type IX cross-linking relationship. Peptide analysis also revealed an unknown amino acid sequence linked to the COL2 cross-linking domains in both the alpha 1(IX) and alpha 3(IX) chains. Using antibodies to this novel peptide, its origin in the collagen alpha 3(IX)NC1 domain was established. In summary, the results confirm extensive covalent cross-linking between type IX and type II collagen molecules and reveal the existence of type IX-type IX bonding. These data provide a molecular basis for the proposed function of type IX collagen as a critical contributor to the mechanical stability and resistance to swelling of the collagen type II fibril framework of cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W1530522271,"Opening of the three tandem repeats of a 13-mer in the replication origin (oriC) of Escherichia coli is a prime event in the replication in vitro of minichromosomes (Bramhill, D., and Kornberg, A. (1988) Cell 54, 915-918). DnaA, the initiator protein, requires protein HU or IHF, along with a millimolar level of ATP and negative superhelical density in the plasmid to open this region. The extent of opening, as judged by cleavage by a single-strand-specific endonuclease (i.e. P1 nuclease), correlated closely with replication of the oriC plasmid. In an initial complex, preceding opening of the 13-mers, the footprint of DnaA protein bound by ATP covered its four 9-mer recognition sequences. The footprint of the nucleotide-free form of the protein, by contrast, was more extensive and thus, less specific."
https://openalex.org/W1484515711,"Treatment of the human lung fibroblast cell line, WI-38, with interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) results in a large increase in the production of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The IL-1-induced accumulation of cPLA2 is closely correlated with increased PGE2 release. In contrast to cPLA2, the level of cyclooxygenase remains unchanged following IL-1 alpha treatment. The glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, blocks the IL-1 alpha-mediated increases in both cPLA2 and PGE2 without affecting the cyclooxygenase level. Taken together, these data suggest that in these cells, the regulation of prostaglandin production by IL-1 and glucocorticoid can be attributed to the level of cPLA2. These results provide a new mechanism for the effect of IL-1 and glucocorticoids on eicosanoid synthesis and provide additional support for an important role of cPLA2 in the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1589891059,"The fatty acid-binding protein from rat intestine (I-FABP) has been covalently modified with the fluorescent compound Acrylodan. Acrylodan was found to label Lys27, one of the few amino acid residues found by x-ray diffraction studies to change orientation upon fatty acid (FA) binding to I-FABP. Binding of FA to this Acrylodan-modified I-FABP (ADIFAB) induces a large shift in fluorescence emission wavelength from 432 to 505 nm. As a consequence, the ratio of emission intensities provides a direct measure of the concentration of FA bound to the protein. Binding of FA is well described by single site equilibrium for FA concentrations below the critical micelle concentration. ADIFAB dissociation constants (Kd) determined at 37 degrees C and at concentrations below the critical micelle concentration for oleate, palmitate, linoleate, arachidonate, and linolenate were, respectively, 0.28, 0.33, 0.97, 1.6, and 2.5 microM. The variation of these Kd values with FA molecular species is highly correlated with the solubility of the FA in water, suggesting that all these FA bind with a similar conformation in the I-FABP binding site. The ADIFAB response together with the measured equilibrium constants allows a direct determination of the concentration of long chain free fatty acid (FFA) in the concentration range, depending upon the FA molecular species, between 1 nM and > 20 microM. As an example of its use as a probe to measure FFA levels, ADIFAB is used here to monitor the time course for FFA release from IgE receptor- and ionomycin-activated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells."
https://openalex.org/W1492237429,"The Yersinia protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) Yop51, a C235R point mutation (Yop51*), and a protein lacking the first 162 amino acids at the NH2 terminus (Yop51*delta 162) have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity through the use of CM Sephadex C25 cation exchange chromatography followed by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. Greater than 50 mg of homogeneous Yop51* and Yop51*delta 162 can be obtained from a single liter of bacterial culture, whereas the same procedure yields only 5 mg of pure Yop51. Large, diffraction-quality crystals have been obtained for Yop51*delta 162. Size exclusion chromatography, sedimentation equilibrium, and enzyme concentration dependence experiments have established that the Yersinia PTPases exist and function as monomers in solution. Yop51 and Yop51* display identical UV, CD, and fluorescence spectra and have identical kinetic and structural stability properties. These full-length Yersinia PTPases have 31% alpha-helix, an emission maximum of 342 nm, a turn-over number of 1200 s-1 at pH 5.0, 30 degrees C, and an unfolding delta G value of 6 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C. Yop51*delta 162 has very similar kinetic and fluorescence characteristics to the full-length molecules, whereas its CD and UV spectra show noticeable differences due to the elimination of 162 NH2-terminal residues. The Yersinia PTPases are by far the most active PTPases known, and their kinetic parameters are extremely sensitive to the ionic strength of reaction medium."
https://openalex.org/W1583264261,"Sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate, metabolites of membrane sphingolipids, have recently been shown to stimulate release of calcium from internal sources and to increase proliferation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (Zhang, H., Desai, N. N., Olivera, A., Seki, T., Brooker, G., and Spiegel, S. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 114, 155-167). The present study demonstrates that mitogenic concentrations of sphingosine induce early increases in sphingosine-1-phosphate levels which precede the increase in the potent mitogen, phosphatidic acid. Sphingosine-1-phosphate itself induces a more rapid increase in phosphatidic acid, thus suggesting that it may mediate the effects of sphingosine on phosphatidic acid accumulation. The concentration dependence for the formation of phosphatidic acid induced by sphingosine-1-phosphate correlates with its effect on DNA synthesis. Similar to sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate also stimulates the activity of phospholipase D, although a significant effect is observed at a much lower concentration. However, in contrast to previous reports with sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate does not inhibit the phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activity in cell homogenates. Thus, in addition to its effect on mobilization of calcium, sphingosine-1-phosphate can increase the level of phosphatidic acid, most likely via activation of phospholipase D. We suggest that sphingosine-1-phosphate mediates the effect of sphingosine on phosphatidic acid accumulation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and may regulate cellular proliferation by affecting multiple transmembrane signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1547705375,"Eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor (eIF) 4 gamma, also known as p220, is a component of the protein complex eIF-4, which is involved in the recognition of the mRNA cap, ATP-dependent unwinding of 5'-terminal secondary structure and recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome. Peptide sequence data from rabbit reticulocyte eIF-4 gamma was used to synthesize oligonucleotide probes and polymerase chain reaction primers. These were used to screen lambda-cDNA libraries from rabbit and human brain, yielding a partial rabbit and a complete human cDNA sequence of 5.1 kilobases. Northern blot and primer extension analysis indicated that the cDNA sequence was complete. To confirm that the cDNA represented that of eIF-4 gamma, three peptides were synthesized based on cDNA sequences and used to produce anti-peptide antibodies. The antibodies specifically recognized intact eIF-4 gamma and its cleavage products following poliovirus infection. The eIF-4 gamma mRNA contains AUG codons at nucleotides 6, 67, 90, 165, and 369, but only the last is followed by a long open reading frame. The eIF-4 gamma polypeptide is 154 kDa (1396 amino acid residues) and contains sequence motifs of potential interest: a sequence (AGLGPR) that is similar to the substrate recognition sequence of protease 2A from rhinovirus serotype 14, five PEST regions with scores greater than 10, which are characteristic of rapidly degraded proteins, stretches of polyglutamic acid, and numerous potential phosphorylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1538110568,"Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a copper-containing metalloglycoprotein that catalyzes several steps in the melanin pigment biosynthetic pathway; the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and the subsequent oxidation of dopa to dopaquinone. It has been proposed that tyrosinase is also able to oxidize 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), a later product in the melanogenic pathway, to indole-5,6-quinone. Tyrosinase enzymatic activity is deficient in patients with classic type I oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), and more than 50 distinct mutations have now been identified in the tyrosinase genes of such patients. To determine the effects of the various tyrosinase gene mutations on the catalytic activities of the enzyme, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of human tyrosinase cDNA, transiently expressed the mutant cDNAs in transfected HeLa cells, and assayed the resultant encoded proteins for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa, and DHI oxidase activities, and resulting melanin production. The tyrosine hydroxylase activity of normal tyrosinase is thermostable, whereas its dopa oxidase and DHI oxidase activities are temperature-sensitive. Although all amino acid substitutions tested generally affected the dopa oxidase and DHI oxidase activities in parallel, several exerted distinctly different effects on the tyrosine hydroxylase activities. Together, these results confirm the DHI oxidase activity of mammalian tyrosinase and suggest that the dopa oxidase and DHI oxidase activities of tyrosinase share a common catalytic site, whereas the tyrosine hydroxylase catalytic site is at least partially distinct in the tyrosinase polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1517222706,"We examined the role of transcription in directing repair of DNA damage in active genes by comparing the repair of thymine glycols produced by H2O2 and of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers on each strand of the GAL7 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Repair of both thymine glycols and pyrimidine dimers on the transcribed strand of the gene occurs two to three times faster than on its nontranscribed strand or in the genome overall. When the gene is inactive, no preferential or strand-selective repair is observed. Using a yeast strain containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in one of the subunits of RNA polymerase II, we find that inactivating RNA polymerase II by shifting the cells to the nonpermissive temperature during repair eliminates the strand selectivity of repair under conditions where repair on the nontranscribed strand of the gene and in the genome overall are only slightly affected. Our observation of strand-selective repair of thymine glycols in the GAL7 gene is the first evidence that this repair process occurs for a nonbulky lesion. In addition, we demonstrate that the transcriptional complex plays a critical role in directing repair to the transcribed strand of active genes."
https://openalex.org/W1516061897,"We report the expression cloning of pMev, a cDNA that facilitates cellular uptake of mevalonate. pMev was isolated from the met-18b-2 clone of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which were selected for growth in low concentrations of mevalonate when synthesis is blocked by compactin (Faust, J. R., and Krieger, M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1996-2004). pMev encodes a 494-residue protein, Mev, that is predicted to have 12 membrane-spanning regions, consistent with a membrane transporter. Surprisingly, levels of Mev mRNA and protein are similar in CHO and met-18b-2 cells. The Mev gene differs from the wild-type gene by a single base change that substitutes a cysteine for phenylalanine in the 10th membrane-spanning region. met-18b-2 cells are heterozygous for this dominant gain-of-function mutation. Transfection of a cDNA encoding pMev, but not the wild-type cDNA, elicited a marked increase in [3H]mevalonate uptake and incorporation into cellular lipids in stably and transiently transfected cells. The availability of pMev will facilitate studies of [3H]mevalonate incorporation into trace products, including p21ras and other prenylated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1497282221,"Human and porcine factor VIII (fVIII) are activated by thrombin to form a heterotrimer composed of subunits designated A1 and A2 derived from the fVIII heavy chain (HC) and a subunit designated A3-C1-C2 derived from the fVIII light chain (LC). Human and porcine fVIII were activated at the same rate to the same peak levels but dissociation of the A2 subunit and concomitant loss of fVIIIa activity at pH 7.4 and 22 degrees C was 3-fold faster with human fVIIIa compared to porcine fVIIIa (0.35 min-1 versus 0.12 min-1, respectively). To determine structural requirements for the increased activity of porcine fVIII, plasma-derived hybrid human/porcine fVIII molecules were isolated. Porcine HC/human LC (pHC/hLC) fVIII had 44-fold higher coagulant activity than reconstituted human fVIII (hHC/hLC), 40-fold higher activity than hHC/pLC, and slightly (1.4-fold) higher activity than reconstituted porcine fVIII (pHC/pLC). Additionally, human and porcine A2 subunits and inactive A1/A3-C1-C2 human and porcine dimers were isolated and reconstitution experiments were done. Addition of the porcine A2 subunit to the human A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer produced coagulant activity similar to that found with porcine fVIIIa and superior to human fVIIIa. These results suggest that human fVIII has weaker coagulant activity than porcine fVIII due to faster dissociation of the A2 subunit and that the A2 subunit itself is responsible for the difference."
https://openalex.org/W2153275719,"The inhibitory effects of caffeine on receptor-activated cytosolic Ca2+ signal generation in isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells were investigated. Using the ability of caffeine to quench Indo-1 fluorescence we measured simultaneously the free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the intracellular caffeine concentration ([caffeine]i). We also measured inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) production with a radioreceptor assay. When caffeine was added to the extracellular solution during a sustained receptor-activated increase in [Ca2+]i, [caffeine]i rose to its steady level within a few seconds. This was accompanied by a decrease of [Ca2+]i, which started only after [caffeine]i had reached an apparent threshold concentration (about 2 mM in the case of 0.5 microM acetylcholine (ACh) stimulation). Above this [caffeine]i level there was a linear relationship between [caffeine]i and [Ca2+]i. Throughout the caffeine exposure [Ca2+]i remained at a steady low level. Following removal of caffeine from the bath, [caffeine]i decreased to zero within seconds. There was no significant increase in [Ca2+]i until [caffeine]i had been reduced to the threshold level (about 2 mM at 0.5 microM ACh). Caffeine inhibited Ca2+ signals evoked by ACh, cholecystokinin, and ATP and also inhibited signals generated in the absence of external Ca2+. Caffeine application had the same effect as removal of agonist allowing recovery from apparent desensitization. Caffeine inhibited the agonist-evoked production of InsP3 in a dose-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate the acute and reversible dose-dependent inhibition of agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ signal generation due to rapid intracellular caffeine accumulation and washout. The inhibition can be explained by the reduction of agonist-evoked InsP3 production."
https://openalex.org/W1574894918,"The structure of rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) with bound oleate (C18:1) has been refined with x-ray diffraction data to a resolution of 1.75 A. The protein contains 10 anti-parallel beta strands composed of 99 residues and 2 short helices of 14 residues. Oleate is located in the interior of the protein in a bent conformation with C1-C12 more ordered than C13-C18. Two of the eight ordered waters in I-FABP:oleate are part of a hydrogen bond network that includes the carboxylate of oleate, the guanidinium group of Arg106, the nitrogen of the indole group of Trp82, and the side chain of Gln115. Most of the methylenes of bound oleate reside in a crevice formed by hydrophobic and aromatic side chains. Tyr70 and Tyr117 envelop the acyl chain from C3 to C8 forming contacts with both the convex and concave faces of its van der Waals surface. The hydroxyls of each phenolic side chain hydrogen bond to ordered water molecules. Two ordered waters make van der Waals contact with the concave face of the bound fatty acid. The omega-terminal methyl of oleate is oriented so that it points toward the center of the benzene of Phe55 allowing it to form van der Waals interactions with its component methylenes. Comparison of the structure of I-FABP:oleate with a recently refined 1.19-A model of apoI-FABP and an earlier 2.0-A model of I-FABP:palmitate revealed a remarkable degree of similarity in the positions of their main chain and side chain atoms and in the conformations of the bound oleate and palmitate. The principal differences were confined to a few discrete regions of the protein. The helical domain, the type I turn between beta strands C and D, and the ring of Phe55 together form a solvent-accessible portal to the interior of the protein. They are repositioned in I-FABP:oleate (and I-FABP:palmitate) so that the binding cavity is even more accessible to solvent and its volume is increased. The side chain of Phe55 which shows discrete disorder in the apoprotein functions as an omega-terminal sensing device: moving progressively outward toward the surface as the chain length of the bound fatty acid increases by 2 methylenes. Tyr70 and Tyr117 which also show discrete disorder in the apoprotein structure due to rotation around their C alpha-C beta bonds, are stabilized in a single, well ordered position in the holoproteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The results indicate that 1) both alpha- and beta-galactosyl residues are recognized equally well; 2) each of the hydroxyl groups of galactose contributes to varying degrees to the binding process, the 4-OH being the most important and the 6-OH the least important hydroxyl group; 3) disaccharide sequences of Gal beta 2Gal and Gal beta 3Gal have much higher affinity than galactose, whereas affinity of all other Gal-disaccharides is only slightly better than galactose; 4) macromolecular ligands having 10 or more terminal galactosyl residues have 500-fold higher affinity than Gal; and 5) a group on ML-1 with pK alpha of 4.8 appears to be involved in the binding of ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1567801238,"The interaction of factor VIIa with tissue factor (TF) results in an increase in the catalytic efficiency for the hydrolysis of several synthetic peptidyl p-nitroanilide substrates by factor VIIa. The binding of human recombinant factor VIIa to recombinant human TF incorporated into vesicles containing phosphatidylcholine (TF/PC) or phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (TF/PCPS) was studied using the increased rate of H-D-phenylalanyl L-pipecoyl L-arginine p-nitroanilide (S2238) hydrolysis as a signal for the interaction. The saturable dependence of rate on increasing concentrations of factor VIIa or TF/PCPS yielded no obvious evidence for cooperativity and could be analyzed according to the interaction of factor VIIa with independent noninteracting sites (Kd = 259 +/- 60 pM, n = 1.05 +/- 0.12 mol of factor VIIa/mol of TF at saturation). Identical titration curves and equilibrium parameters were derived from titrations using TF/PC or TF in the absence of phospholipids, indicating that possible protein-membrane interactions do not further stabilize the extrinsic Xase complex. The dissociation constant for the interaction of factor VIIa with TF/PCPS inferred from measurements of factor X activation (Kd = 197 +/- 38 pM) was comparable with the values obtained from measurements of S2238 hydrolysis. In contrast to the membrane-independent nature of the enzyme-cofactor interaction, the rate of factor X activation was reduced by approximately 50-fold when the enzyme complex was assembled using solution-phase TF. Collectively, the result indicate that the membrane dependence of extrinsic Xase function primarily results from an influence of the membrane surface on factor X utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1532023408,"Abstract The movement of reconstituted thin filaments over an immobilized surface of thiophosphorylated smooth muscle myosin was examined using an in vitro motility assay. Reconstituted thin filaments contained actin, tropomyosin, and either purified chicken gizzard caldesmon or the purified COOH-terminal actin-binding fragment of caldesmon. Control actin-tropomyosin filaments moved at a velocity of 2.3 +/- 0.5 microns/s. Neither intact caldesmon nor the COOH-terminal fragment, when maintained in the monomeric form by treatment with 10 mM dithiothreitol, had any effect on filament velocity; and yet both were potent inhibitors of actin-activated myosin ATPase activity, indicating that caldesmon primarily inhibits myosin binding as reported by Chalovich et al. (Chalovich, J. M., Hemric, M. E., and Velaz, L. (1990) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 599, 85-99). Inhibition of filament motion was, however, observed under conditions where cross-linking of caldesmon via disulfide bridges was present. To determine if monomeric caldesmon could tether actin filaments to the myosin surface by forming an actin-caldesmon-myosin complex as suggested by Chalovich et al., we looked for caldesmon-dependent filament binding and motility under conditions (80 mM KCl) where filament binding to myosin is weak and motility is not normally seen. At caldesmon concentrations > or = 0.26 microM, actin filament binding was increased and filament motion (2.6 +/- 0.6 microns/s) was observed. The enhanced motility seen with intact caldesmon was not observed with the addition of up to 26 microM COOH-terminal fragment. Moreover, a molar excess of the COOH-terminal fragment competitively reversed the enhanced binding seen with intact caldesmon. These results show that tethering of actin filaments to myosin by the formation of an actin-caldesmon-myosin complex enhanced productive acto-myosin interaction without placing a significant mechanical load on the moving filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1571355387,"Oxidative degradation of collagen and the model peptides by Cu(II)/H2O2 has been studied. The depolymerization of collagen was predominantly observed by use of gel filtration chromatography. Polyproline was used as a model for collagen, and the oxidative modification was examined by amino acid analysis. Glutamic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid were identified in the hydrolysates of oxidized polyproline. The formation of glutamic acid was reduced by treatment with NaBH4. The model peptide, (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, was also degraded by Cu(II)/H2O2, and a new N-terminal glycine was generated in proportion to the reaction time. Hydroxyl radical scavengers show only partial inhibition of the degradation of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10. In order to estimate the fragmentation mechanism, we used N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-L-prolylglycine as a model for collagen and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10. The degradation products were isolated and characterized. Then N-tert-Boc-2-pyrrolidone, which provides gamma-aminobutyric acid by acid hydrolysis, was identified. The formation of a 2-pyrrolidone compound from oxidized Boc-L-prolylglycine is direct evidence for the scission of the peptide bond. The time-dependent formation of N-tert-Boc-2-pyrrolidone and liberation of glycine from N-tert-Boc-L-prolylglycine exposed to Cu(II)/H2O2 was observed. These results suggest that the cleavage of the peptide bond (Pro-Gly) was caused by oxidation of the proline residue, which led to the formation of the 2-pyrrolidone compound. We confirmed that proline oxidation leads to the fragmentation of proteins, accompanied by the formation of a 2-pyrrolidone structure."
https://openalex.org/W1651232149,"Fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) synthase was obtained from rat adipose tissue in an electrophoretically homogeneous form. The enzyme associated with carboxylesterase activity was purified by acetone precipitation followed by successive chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, phenyl-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-100 gel. The two activities in rat adipose tissue were associated as judged by their co-elution profiles, co-purifications at different steps, co-precipitations by antibody raised against purified FAEE synthase, and identical profiles of inhibition by diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The enzyme catalyzed the hydrolyses of both tri- and monoacylglycerols, and the susceptibilities of substrates increase with decreasing acyl chain length of the fatty acid moiety. Ethyl oleate-hydrolyzing activity was about one-eighth of the synthesizing activity. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 27 residues of the purified enzyme was identical to that of the carboxylesterase from rat liver. With a polyclonal rabbit antibody against the rat adipose tissue FAEE synthase, the enzyme was demonstrated in the liver, lung, and testis, but not in the kidney. The antibody removed the FAEE-synthesizing activities in adipose tissue (86%), liver (23%), lung (62%), and testis (82%). These results suggest that carboxylesterase contributes to the nonoxidative ethanol metabolism (FAEE synthesis) in various organs."
https://openalex.org/W1553792445,"Because of the structural similarity between glucose and ascorbic acid, we investigated the effect of glucose on uptake and accumulation of ascorbic acid in isolated normal human neutrophils. Ascorbic acid accumulation was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with coulometric electrochemical detection, in conjunction with liquid scintillation spectrometry. Ascorbic acid accumulation in neutrophils is mediated by a high and a low affinity transport activity. In neutrophils from different volunteers, glucose inhibited uptake and accumulation of ascorbic acid by both transport activities 3-9-fold. The mechanism of inhibition was different for each transport activity: inhibition of the high affinity transport activity was noncompetitive, while inhibition of the low affinity activity was competitive. Glucose-induced inhibition of both ascorbic acid transport activities occurred in neutrophils of all donors tested and was fully reversible. Although the mechanism of ascorbic acid accumulation appeared to be different than that for glucose transport, other monosaccharides and glucose transport inhibitors also inhibited ascorbic acid accumulation. These are the first data to suggest that ascorbic acid accumulation in neutrophils can be regulated by compounds of similar structure."
https://openalex.org/W1558418950,"The uptake of uracil by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a specific permease encoded by the FUR4 gene. This uracil permease is a multispanning membrane protein that follows the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. We have used in vivo pulse labeling and immunoprecipitation to show that the uracil permease is phosphorylated. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicates that the phosphorylation occurs on seryl residues. Experiments with temperature sensitive secretory mutants, blocked at successive steps of the secretory pathway, have established that the phosphorylation of the permease takes place at the plasma membrane. Under steady state conditions, Western immunoblotting showed multiple phosphorylated permease species. Their relative abundance appeared susceptible to metabolic conditions. This study is, therefore, a first step toward identifying a molecular mechanism involved in the post-translational control of a yeast transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1544375584,"Heat stress and ultraviolet light in the UVB range (sunburn spectrum, 290-320 nm) were found to alter the synthesis of specific proteins in cultured keratinocytes derived from mouse skin. Using giant two-dimensional gels, approximately 2,000 cellular polypeptides labeled with [35S]methionine at 4-5 h after exposure to heat or to UVB were analyzed. Cells conditioned at sublethal temperatures (42 degrees C for 1 h, or 47 degrees C for 15 min) developed thermotolerance, while cells conditioned with UVB did not develop thermotolerance. Under these heat or UVB conditions, 19 stress proteins were observed. Proteins fell into three classes based upon their inducibility by heat or UVB, dose-response, and induction mechanism (transcriptional versus post-transcriptional) as defined by metabolic blockade with cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine). Class 1 proteins were inducible only by heat shock. They included three major heat-shock proteins (hsp 72, hsp 78, hsp 90) and a 42.5-kDa, pI 5.43 protein, and all were induced at the transcriptional level. Class 2 proteins were inducible by heat and by UVB. These included hsp 110 and eight additional polypeptides. All but one were affected by heat at the post-transcriptional level and were induced by UVB at both low (20 mJ/cm2) and high (80 mJ/cm2) doses. Class 3 proteins were inducible only at high UVB doses (survival < 10%). Class 1 and Class 2 proteins could be functionally involved in thermotolerance, while Class 3 proteins are more likely related to damage or cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1511741227,"The growth functions of the heterotrimeric G protein G(o) was studied by expression in heterologous systems. The alpha-subunit of G(o) was mutated to convert Gln-205 to Leu (Q205L). Mutation of this conserved glutamine residue in G protein alpha-subunits is thought to persistently activate G proteins by inhibiting their GTPase activity. The wild type and mutant G(o)-alpha subunits were expressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. These cells do not contain any measurable amounts of G(o)-alpha mRNA or protein. Transfection of wild type or Q205LG(o)-alpha subunit cDNA under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter results in dexamethasone-dependent transcription of the mRNA and expression of the protein. The Q205LG(o)-alpha, but not wild type G(o)-alpha, stimulates mitogenesis in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts without significantly stimulating phospholipase C activity. Continuous expression of mutant G(o)-alpha induces focus formation, whereas transfections with vector alone or vector containing the native G(o)-alpha cDNA were without significant transforming effect in NIH-3T3 cells. Q205L G(o)-alpha did not induce focus formation in RAT-1 fibroblasts. Q205LG(o)-alpha-transformed NIH-3T3 cells are capable of anchorage-independent growth, as assessed by colony formation in soft agar. Q205LG(o)-alpha transformed cells induced tumors when injected into Nu/Nu mice. These results indicate that mutant G(o)-alpha subunits whose GTPase activity is presumably inhibited can induce the neoplastic transformation of NIH-3T3 cells in a phospholipase C-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1483681573,"Bacterially expressed alpha-tropomyosin lacks the amino-terminal acetylation present in muscle tropomyosin and binds poorly to actin (Hitchcock-DeGregori, S. E., and Heald, R. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9730-9735). Using a linear lattice model, we determined the affinity (Ko) of unacetylated tropomyosin or troponin-unacetylated tropomyosin for an isolated site on the actin filament and the fold increase in affinity (y) when binding is to an adjacent site. The absence of tropomyosin acetylation decreased Ko 2 orders of magnitude in the absence of troponin. Tropomyosin acetylation also enhanced troponin-tropomyosin binding to actin, not by increasing cooperativity (y), but rather by increasing Ko. These results suggest that the amino-terminal region of tropomyosin is a crucial actin binding site. Troponin promoted unacetylated tropomyosin binding to actin, increasing Ko more than 1,000-fold. Troponin70-259, which lacks the troponin T peptide (1-69) spanning the overlap between adjacent tropomyosins, behaved similarly to intact troponin. Cooperative interactions between adjacent troponin-tropomyosin complexes remained strong despite the use of a nonpolymerizable tropomyosin and a troponin unable to bridge neighboring tropomyosins physically. The Ko for troponin70-259-unacetylated tropomyosin was 500-fold greater than for troponin159-259-unacetylated tropomyosin, indicating that troponin T residues 70-158 are critical for anchoring troponin-tropomyosin to F-actin. The mechanism of cooperative thin filament assembly is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1522083389,"Quiescent rat glomerular mesangial cells were exposed to repeated cycles of stretching and relaxation, and the effects on the rate of collagen production, proliferation, and S6 kinase activity were investigated. Stretch/relaxation induced increases in production of both collagen and non-collagenous proteins. Proliferation of mesangial cells was stimulated by stretch/relaxation and epidermal growth factor, but not by angiotensin II; however, administration of angiotensin II augmented stretch/relaxation-induced cell proliferation. Cytosolic S6 kinase activity was stimulated by stretch/relaxation, angiotensin II, epidermal growth factor, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The increased S6 kinase activity was detectable within 30 min after initiation of stretch/relaxation and was blocked by either inhibitors of protein kinase C or prior down-regulation of protein kinase C following prolonged incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Both translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction and phosphorylation of an endogenous 80-kDa protein were observed within 5 min of initiation of stretch/relaxation. These results demonstrate that in mesangial cells, mechanical factors alone can induce increases in production of collagen and non-collagenous proteins and in cell proliferation. The observation that stretch/relaxation induced stimulation of S6 kinase activity through protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms suggests that activation of protein kinase C may be a key event in initiating adaptive responses of mesangial cells to increased workload."
https://openalex.org/W1491301761,"The opening of the three tandem 13-mers (iterons) in the replication origin (oriC) of Escherichia coli by DnaA protein, assisted by protein HU or IHF (Hwang, D. S., and Kornberg, A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23083-23086), represents an essential early stage in the initiation of chromosomal replication (Bramhill, D., and Kornberg, A. (1988) Cell 54, 915-918). We now show by mutational alterations of the 13-mer region that oriC function, both in vitro and in vivo, requires AT-richness in the left 13-mer and sequence specificity in the middle and right 13-mers. Interactions of DnaA protein with the middle and right 13-mers are crucial for the opening of the region. Binding of the protein to the top strand of the 13-mers appeared to maintain single-strandedness in the bottom strand. IciA protein, the inhibitor of initiation, binds the three 13-mers and blocks the opening of the region. The degrees of inhibition by IciA protein of 13-mer opening and of oriC plasmid replication observed with mutant forms of the 13-mers could be correlated with the binding affinity of IciA protein. Whereas the binding of IciA protein to the 13-mers did not affect the binding of DnaA protein to its four 9-mers boxes, interaction of DnaA protein with the 13-mers was blocked. The selective interactions of DnaA and IciA proteins with the 13-mer region appear to be components of the on/off switch that controls initiation of E. coli chromosomal replication."
https://openalex.org/W1634297904,"The widely expressed Na(+)-independent transporter for basic amino acids (system y+) is the cell surface receptor (ecoR) for ecotropic host-range mouse retroviruses (murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs)), a class of retroviruses that naturally infects only mice or rats. Accordingly, expression of mouse ecoR cDNA in mink CCL64 fibroblasts yields cells (CEN cells) that have y+ transporter activity above the endogenous background and that bind and are infected by ecotropic MuLVs. The effect of ecotropic MuLV infection on expression of y+ transporter was analyzed in mouse and in mink CEN fibroblasts. Chronic infection with ecotropic MuLVs caused 50-70% loss (down-modulation) of mouse y+ transporter in plasma membranes, detected as a reduced Vmax for uptake and outflow of L-[3H]arginine with no effect on Km values. Down-modulation was specific for mouse y+ and did not affect other transporters or the endogenous mink y+, suggesting that it results from specific interaction between mouse y+ and the viral envelope glycoprotein gp70 in the infected cells. Because this partial loss of mouse y+ from cell surfaces is insufficient to explain the complete interference to superinfection that occurs in cells chronically infected with ecotropic MuLVs, alternative explanations for interference are proposed. In contrast to the y+ down-modulation caused by chronic infection, binding of extracellular envelope glycoprotein gp70 at 37 degrees C resulted in noncompetitive inhibition of amino acid import by mouse y+ but had no effect on export through this same transporter or on any transporter properties of mink y+. The effects of gp70 on transport kinetics suggest that it slows the rate-limiting step of the amino acid import cycle, a conformational transition of the empty transporter in which the binding site moves from the inside back to the outside of the cell, and that gp70 has no effect on the rate-limiting step of the amino acid export cycle. Infected cells retain substantial y+ activity. Moreover, the virus binding site on ecoR is in a mobile region that changes conformation during the amino acid transport cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2153376408,"Receptor activation may result in distinct subcellular patterns of Ca2+ release. To define the subcellular distribution of Ca2+i signals induced by stimulation of the vasopressin V1a receptor, we expressed the cloned receptor in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were then loaded with fluo-3 and observed using confocal microscopy. Vasopressin induced a single concentric wave of increased Ca2+ that radiated inward from the plasma membrane. With submaximal stimulation, however, regions of the Ca2+ wave spontaneously reorganized into repetitive (oscillatory) waves. Focal stimulation of a small part of the plasma membrane resulted in a Ca2+ wave which began at the point of stimulation, radiated toward the center of the cell, then reorganized into multiple foci of repetitive, colliding waves and spirals of increased Ca2+i. The pattern of Ca2+ signaling induced by focal or global stimulation was not altered in Ca(2+)-free medium, although signals did not propagate as fast. Finally, subcellular Ca2+ signaling patterns induced by vasopressin were inhibited by caffeine, while neither vasopressin nor microinjection of inositol trisphosphate blocked caffeine-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+. Thus, stimulation of the V1a receptor in this cell system induces a complex pattern of Ca2+ signaling which is influenced by (1) the magnitude of the stimulus, (2) the distribution of the surface receptors that are stimulated, and (3) mobilization of Ca2+ from the extracellular space as well as from two distinct endogenous Ca2+ pools. The manner in which a single type of receptor is activated may represent an important potential mechanism for subcellular Ca2+i signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1539131136,"Two peptides (PEP1, 26 residues, and PEP2, 22 residues) were synthesized with amino acid sequences identical to two of the long segments of polypeptide chain rich in alanine, proline, and charged amino acids that link the lipoyl domains together in the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Escherichia coli. The circular dichroism and 400-MHz 1H NMR spectra of the peptides indicated that they lacked regular secondary structure. Even in the presence of 45% (v/v) hexafluoroisopropanol, they appeared to acquire a helical content of only 23-25%. However, 13C NMR spectroscopy revealed that the Ala-Pro peptide bonds were all (> 95%) in the trans configuration, compared with a value of 87% for the Ala-Pro bond in the model peptide AAPA, which is a recurrent sequence motif in PEP1 and PEP2. Likewise in peptides representing the N- and C-terminal halves of peptide PEP2, the Ala-Pro bonds were again all (> 95%)-trans, suggesting that peptide length is the essential determinant of the cis:trans ratio. Antisera were raised against peptides PEP2 and PEP3, the latter representing a third interdomain segment of polypeptide chain (Radford, S. E., Laue, E. D., Perham, R. N., Martin, S. R., and Appella, E. (1989a) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 767-775). Despite extensive sequence similarity among peptides PEP1, PEP2, and PEP3, only limited immunological cross-reactivity was observed, which suggests that the antigenic epitope(s) in the peptides are different and distinct. It is likely that these peptides are representative of a class of inter-domain linkers or spacers found in a wide variety of proteins and endowed with varying degrees of flexibility and stiffness to match their particular biological purpose."
https://openalex.org/W1602759787,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) is a potent stimulator of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) synthesis and secretion in mouse macrophage tumor cells (Golenbock, D. T., Hampton, R. Y., Qureshi, N., Takayama, K., and Raetz, C. H. R. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19490-19498). In contrast, addition of LPS (10 ng/ml) to human monomyelocytic (Mono Mac 6) cells induces very little production of TNF alpha, as judged by immunoassay of the growth medium. When 30 ng/ml 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is added together with LPS, large amounts of TNF alpha are secreted. PMA alone is inactive. Maximal TNF alpha levels in the medium are achieved at 1 ng/ml of LPS. Protein kinase C inhibitors, such as H7 (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine), staurosporine, and sphingosine, reduce TNF alpha secretion stimulated by PMA. The effect of PMA has been investigated at each stage of TNF alpha biogenesis. Treatment of Mono Mac 6 cells with LPS alone results in rapid, transient, and full expression of TNF alpha mRNA. Concomitant addition of PMA does not increase TNF alpha mRNA synthesis any further, but it prolongs the half-life of TNF alpha mRNA about 3-fold. However, mRNA stabilization does not account for the striking effect of PMA on TNF alpha secretion. Analysis of TNF alpha synthesis and secretion by immunoprecipitation indicates that LPS alone is fully effective in stimulating the formation of the intracellular 26-kDa TNF alpha precursor. LPS alone is not sufficient to allow processing of the precursor and secretion of mature 17-kDa TNF alpha. The rate of TNF alpha secretion observed immediately after the addition of PMA to LPS-pretreated cells is similar to the maximum rate from LPS/PMA-treated cells, but without the lag observed in cells after being exposed to LPS and PMA simultaneously. In summary, PMA is required for the completion of TNF alpha precursor processing and secretion in LPS-treated human Mono Mac 6 cells, whereas murine RAW cells are able to complete the terminal steps of TNF alpha processing in the absence of PMA."
https://openalex.org/W1526826406,"A mispair-specific 3'-->5' exonuclease copurifies quantitatively with the near-homogeneous Drosophila gamma polymerase (Kaguni, L.S., and Olson, M.W. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 6469-6473). The exonuclease and polymerase exhibit similar reaction requirements and optima, suggesting functional coordination of their activities. Under nonpolymerization conditions, the 3'-->5' exonuclease hydrolyzes 3'-terminal mispairs approximately 15-fold more efficiently than 3'-terminal base pairs on primed single-stranded DNA substrates, whereas it does not discriminate between any of three specific mispairs (dAMP:dAMP;dGMP:dGMP; dGMP:dAMP). Under conditions, gamma polymerase does not extend a 3'-terminal mispair from the stationary state, even in the presence of a large excess of the next correct nucleotide. Instead, 3'-terminal mispairs are hydrolyzed quantitatively by the 3'-->5' exonuclease over the reaction time course. During DNA synthesis by gamma polymerase in the polymerization mode, limited misincorporation and subsequent mispair extension do occur. Here, it appears that misincorporation and not mispair extension is rate-limiting. Template-primer challenge experiments suggest that the mechanism of template-primer transfer from the 3'-->5' exonuclease active site to the DNA polymerase active site is intermolecular; transfer from the exonuclease to polymerase mode appears to require dissociation and reassociation of mitochondrial DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1548798005,"Tyrosine phosphorylation is a mechanism of signal transduction shared by many growth factor receptors and oncogene products. Phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) potentially modulate or counter-regulate these signaling pathways. To test this hypothesis, the transmembrane PTPase CD45 (leukocyte common antigen) was expressed in the murine cell line C127. Hormone-dependent autophosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors was markedly reduced in cells expressing the transmembrane PTPase. Tyrosine phosphorylation of other PDGF-dependent phosphoproteins (160, 140, and 55 kDa) and IGF-1-dependent phosphoproteins (145 kDa) was similarly decreased. Interestingly, the pattern of growth factor-independent tyrosine phosphorylations was comparable in cells expressing the PTPase and control cells. This suggests a selectivity or accessibility of the PTPase limited to a subset of cellular phosphotyrosyl proteins. The maximum mitogenic response to PDGF and IGF-1 in cells expressing the PTPase was decreased by 67 and 71%, respectively. These results demonstrate that a transmembrane PTPase can both affect the tyrosine phosphorylation state of growth factor receptors and modulate proximal and distal cellular responses to the growth factors."

(1991) Cancer Res. 51, 3420-3426) described a K562 human erythroleukemia line (K562.4CF), characterized by an elevated uptake capacity for methotrexate (MTX) and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and the identification of a highly glycosylated membrane transporter (GP-MTX) by radioaffinity labeling with N-hydroxysuccinimide [3H] methotrexate. In the present study, radioaffinity-labeled GP-MTX from K562.4CF cells was isolated by Ricinus communis agglutinin I-agarose affinity chromatography, coupled with gel filtration and preparative electrophoresis. Antiserum to the purified, radio-labeled protein was raised in a rabbit and screened by immunoblot analysis of K562.4CF plasma membrane proteins or purified GP-MTX. The antiserum detected a broad GP-MTX band centered at 92 kDa on 7.5% gels. On 4-10% gels, the apparent molecular mass for GP-MTX shifted to 99 kDa. Antiserum specificity was established by quantitatively converting the immunoreactive glycoprotein in plasma membrane homogenates to its N- and O-deglycosylated forms with N- and O-glycanases, respectively. Whereas the methotrexate uptake capacity of K562.4CF cells was elevated 6.1-fold over parental cells, the GP-MTX content on immunoblots was increased approximately 3-fold. For two methotrexate-resistant K562 lines (33- and 70-fold), decreased drug uptake (28 and 18% of parental levels) closely correlated with their reduced GP-MTX contents. A GP-MTX isoform was also detected on immunoblots of membrane proteins from CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemia cells. With a transport-impaired CCRF-CEM line (13% of wild type uptake), an aberrant electrophoretic migration for GP-MTX was observed, establishing the presence of structural modifications in the transport protein. These structural differences were independent of carrier glycosylation since they were detected following the glycosidase treatments. These findings implicate important roles for distinct carrier-specific alterations in the expression of diminished drug transport in methotrexate-resistant human tumor cells."

Factor a was required for utilization of six different eukaryotic promoters in vitro, indicating a general role in promoter-directed transcription by yeast RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1591866126,"Because the envelope phosphatidate phosphatase plays a pivotal role in chloroplast glycerolipid metabolism, we have analyzed whether diacylglycerol could be a regulatory factor of the enzyme. Using isolated envelope membranes in which the level of diacylglycerol was modified by thermolysin treatment of intact chloroplasts to destroy the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase, we have demonstrated that phosphatidate phosphatase activity was reduced when the membrane was enriched in diacylglycerol. All 1,2-diacylglycerol molecular species assayed were demonstrated to inhibit the enzyme to about the same extent. Kinetic studies with envelope from thermolysin-treated chloroplasts were performed in the absence and presence of diacylglycerol, and diacylglycerol was shown to be a powerful competitive inhibitor of the reaction. Finally, using isolated intact spinach chloroplasts, we have demonstrated that in situ phosphatidate phosphatase activity can be modulated by the level of diacylglycerol present in the membrane. The relevance of phosphatidate phosphatase inhibition by diacylglycerol in the regulation of chloroplast glycerolipid biosynthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1536490135,"The incorporation of cytosine arabinoside monophosphate (araCMP) into DNA at internucleotide linkages by DNA polymerase alpha (DNA pol alpha) has been investigated by using oligonucleotide primed DNA templates. The products of reactions catalyzed by DNA pol alpha in vitro were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels to measure insertion of araCMP, extension from an araCMP 3' terminus, and binding of the enzyme to an araCMP 3' terminus. The results show that insertion of araCMP opposite dGMP in the DNA template is about 3-fold less efficient than insertion of dCMP. Extension from an araCMP 3' terminus by addition of the next complementary nucleotide is approximately 2000-fold less efficient than extension from a correctly base-paired 3' terminus. In the absence of the second substrate, dNTP, DNA pol alpha binds with approximately equal affinities to DNA templates that contain oligonucleotide primers with araCMP or dCMP positioned at the 3' terminus. In the presence of dNTP, the enzyme extends the araCMP 3' terminus or dissociates, but it is not trapped at the araCMP 3' terminus in a nonproductive ternary complex as is observed at the ddCMP 3' terminus. To determine if slow phosphodiester bond formation contributes to the observed extension rate from the araCMP 3' terminus by DNA pol alpha, oligonucleotide primers with araCMP positioned at the 3' terminus were elongated by addition of the alpha-phosphorothioate analogue of the next complementary nucleotide. The rate of extension from araCMP by addition of 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-phosphorothioate (dAMP alpha S) was 6-fold slower than by addition of dAMP, indicating that bond formation is partially rate limiting in the extension reaction. Thus, inefficient extension from the araCMP 3' terminus is the major determinant contributing to the low incorporation frequency of araCMP into DNA by DNA pol alpha, and this inefficiency can be attributed, in part, to slower phosphodiester bond formation at the araCMP 3' terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1491342502,"Abstract We have previously reported that ganglioside GM3 was remarkably increased during monocytoid differentiation of human myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 cells and that neolacto series gangliosides (NeuAc-nLc) were enriched during granulocytoid differentiation. In addition, HL-60 was differentiated into monocytic lineage by exogenous GM3 and into granulocytoid by NeuAc-nLc. In the present report, the enzymatic bases of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in HL-60 during differentiation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and all-trans-retinoic acid were investigated. The following results were of particular interest. (i) Lactosylceramide alpha 2-->3 sialyltransferase (GM3 synthase) was remarkably up-regulated during monocyte differentiation, while the GM3 synthase level did not change in granulocytic differentiation. (ii) By contrast, lactosylceramide beta 1-->3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Lc3Cer synthase) was down-regulated during monocytic differentiation, while the activity of Lc3Cer synthase was found to increase in granulocytic differentiation. (iii) The activities of four downstream glycosyltransferases (for synthesis of NeuAc-nLc) were found to increase or to remain unchanged during monocytic and granulocytic differentiation. These results strongly suggested the following. The dramatic GM3 increase and the decrease of NeuAc-nLc during monocytic differentiation are the consequences of the up-regulation of GM3 synthase and the down-regulation of Lc3Cer synthase, although the downstream enzymes are ready to catalyze their enzyme reactions. The notable increase of NeuAc-nLc and the relative decrease of GM3 during granulocytic differentiation are the results of the unchanged level of GM3 synthase and the up-regulation of Lc3Cer synthase together with the activation of the downstream glycosyltransferases. These results suggest that these two key upstream glycosyltransferases, GM3 synthase and Lc3Cer synthase, play critical roles in regulating the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in HL-60 cells during differentiation. This switching mechanism of these two glycosyltransferases, together with our previous findings, might be one of the most important parts of the determining system of differentiation direction in human myeloid cells into monocytic or granulocytic lineages."
https://openalex.org/W65510848,"Under substrate adherent conditions, integrin gene expression can be regulated by transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-1 beta, and prostaglandins. This report demonstrates a new mechanism that can differentially control the expression of several integrins. When MG-63 osteosarcoma cells are maintained in suspension, up-regulation of several integrin alpha-subunits takes place. Within as little as 4 h, the mRNA levels for both the alpha 2- and alpha 4-subunits are increased 4- and 6-fold, respectively. It was found that mRNA levels for the alpha 2-, alpha 4-, and alpha v-subunits were markedly increased in several differentiated lines under nonadherent conditions; however, cells that did not express a given integrin under substrate adherent conditions also did not express this integrin when maintained in suspension. The alpha 5-subunit did not upregulate during suspension growth. By immunocytochemistry, changes in integrin mRNA levels were confirmed at the protein level. Both cytochalasin B and a phorbol ester were found to induce the expression of the alpha 2-subunit, but not the alpha 4- and alpha 5-subunits, in a dose-dependent fashion. Many investigators have documented changes in gene expression that result from changes in cell shape. These phenomena may result from up-regulation of integrin gene expression induced by the lack of substrate adherence."

The mutations at amino acid residues 69, 115, and 169 greatly reduced or abolished enzymatic activity. Lysine 69 is the site of Schiff base formation with the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate; the functional role of the other two lysines essential for activity is not known. Coexpression of wild type ornithine decarboxylase along with the lysine 115 to arginine mutant reduced the activity of the former without diminishing the amount of wild type protein. This form of negative complementation was seen when wild type and mutant protein were coexpressed either by in vitro translation or in bacteria. The data are consistent with the conclusion that a wild type and mutant subunit form a heterodimer that is enzymatically inactive."

The most heavily labeled was the alpha subunit of the rod outer segment G protein transducin (Gt alpha). The radiolabeled protein was specifically eluted from illuminated membranes in the presence of GTP, displaying the unique solubility properties of Gt alpha. It comigrated with Gt alpha in electrophoresis and chromatography and was immunoprecipitated by Gt alpha-specific antibodies. The radiolabel was confirmed by hydrolysis, chemical derivatization, and chromatography to be amide-linked myristic acid. The solubility of the myristoylated Gt alpha indicates that myristoylation is not sufficient to cause tight membrane association of this normally membrane-bound subunit. Incorporation of [3H]myristate was blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that that fatty acid group is introduced during or soon after translation in the rod inner segment."
https://openalex.org/W1481321273,"Abstract Type IIA and IIB von Willebrand disease (vWD) result from defects in von Willebrand factor (vWF). Although both type IIA and IIB vWD are characterized by the absence of high molecular weight multimers in plasma, vWF from patients with type IIA vWD demonstrates a decreased affinity for the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), whereas vWF from patients with type IIB vWD show an increased affinity for GPIb. To investigate how structural alterations in vWF affect its interaction with GPIb, we reproduced the reported potential mutations in type IIA and IIB vWD in vWF cDNA and expressed the recombinant proteins in COS-1 cells. The type IIA vWF potential mutation was represented by a G-->A transversion which results in the substitution of Lys for Glu at position 875 in the mature vWF subunit (rvWFLys875). The type IIB vWF mutation corresponds to a duplicated ATG codon, resulting in three contiguous methionines starting at position 540-541 in the normal vWF sequence (rv-WFduplMet540-541). The subunit composition and multimeric structure of both mutant proteins were similar to the wild-type rvWF. The rvWFLys875 bound to fixed platelets in the presence of ristocetin similar to wild-type rvWF. The rvWFduplMet540-541 bound to fixed platelets in the absence of agonist. The rvWFLys875 appears to interact normally with GPIb, and the decreased affinity for the platelet receptor observed in plasma is probably a consequence of prior reduction in multimeric size resulting from the defect. In contrast, the duplication of Met540-541 increases the reactivity of vWF for its platelet receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1516145269,"Hep G2 cells produce surplus A alpha and gamma fibrinogen chains. These excess chains, which are not secreted, exist primarily as free gamma chains and as an A alpha-gamma complex. We have determined the intracellular location and the degradative fate of these polypeptides by treatment with endoglycosidase-H and by inhibiting lysosomal enzyme activity, using NH4Cl, chloroquine, and leupeptin. Free gamma chain and the gamma component of A alpha-gamma are both cleaved by endoglycosidase-H, indicating that the gamma chains accumulate in a pre-Golgi compartment. Lysosomal enzyme inhibitors did not affect the disappearance of free gamma chains but inhibited A alpha-gamma by 50%, suggesting that A alpha-gamma is degraded in lysosomes. The degradative fate of individual chains was determined in transfected COS cells which express but do not secrete single chains. Leupeptin did not affect B beta chain degradation, had very little affect on gamma chain, but markedly inhibited A alpha chain degradation. Antibody to immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (GRP 78) co-immunoprecipitated B beta but not A alpha or gamma chains. Preferential binding of heavy chain-binding protein to B beta was also noted in Hep G2 cells and in chicken hepatocytes. Taken together these studies indicate that B beta and gamma chains are degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum, but only B beta is bound to BiP. By contrast A alpha chains and the A alpha-gamma complex undergo lysosomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1551515990,"Studies were carried out to characterize further the cytoplasmic ATP- and ubiquitin-independent proteolytic system in red blood cells that degrades hemoglobin damaged by exposure to oxidants (Fagan, J. M., Waxman, L., and Goldberg, A. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5705-5713). Several proteases were ruled out as having a major role in the degradation of oxidant-treated hemoglobin (Ox-Hb). Acid hydrolases are not active in this process since the degradation of Ox-Hb has a pH optimum between 6 and 8. The calpains are also not involved since inhibitors of cysteine proteases (leupeptin and trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(3-methyl)butane) did not diminish the increased proteolysis in intact erythrocytes treated with oxidants or in lysates to which Ox-Hb was added. The degradation of Ox-Hb was unaffected by inhibitors of serine and aspartic proteases. Removal of the high M(r) multicatalytic proteinase by immunoprecipitation also did not significantly affect the degradation of Ox-Hb in erythrocyte lysates. The degradation of Ox-Hb was sensitive to metal chelators and sulfhydryl-modifying reagents but not to specific inhibitors of known metalloproteases. Insulin, which is rapidly degraded in lysates, completely blocked the degradation of Ox-Hb. Insulin- and Ox-Hb-hydrolyzing activity was also inhibited following immunoprecipitation of the 100-kDa metalloinsulinase. The metalloinsulinase, which is inhibited by sulfhydryl-modifying reagents and which requires divalent metals, may therefore participate in the degradation of hemoglobin damaged by oxidants in erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1646901593,"Previous studies have suggested a role for protein kinase C (PKC) during induction of murine erythroleukemia cell (MELC) differentiation by hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) (Melloni, E., Pontremoli, S., Viotti, P. L., Patrone, M., Marks, P. A., and Rifkind, R. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18414-18418). The present studies assess the effect of HMBA on the content of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG), the physiologic activator of PKC, in MELC variants. Exposure of parental Sc9 cells to HMBA induced a rapid rise and fall in DG content. The DG level increased within seconds from 225 pmol.10(6) cells-1 to a maximum of 305 pmol.10(6) cells-1 at 5 min. Thereafter, DG content fell reaching control levels at 30 min and 46% of control at 4 h. Similar DG elevations were detected in HMBA-resistant, phorbol ester-resistant, and vincristine-resistant MELC lines. Early DG elevation was followed by the characteristic rapid fall in both the phorbol ester-resistant and vincristine-resistant lines, both of which differentiate rapidly in response to HMBA. In contrast, in an HMBA-resistant MELC the DG level failed to fall for at least 10 h. Selection of HMBA-resistant cells for vincristine resistance restores both HMBA sensitivity and the rapid fall in DG content. Addition of a synthetic DG, 1-oleyl-2-acetyl glycerol (OAG), along with HMBA and every 2 h for the next 48 h blocked differentiation, as measured by accumulation of benzidine-reactive cells or by the commitment assay in methyl-cellulose. However, if addition of OAG was delayed for just a few minutes, until endogenous DG levels began to fall, differentiation was no longer inhibited. Rapid elevation of DG content is the earliest reported event during HMBA action and a subsequent fall in the DG content appears to be a critical step in the process of commitment to terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1510132214,"A monoclonal mouse IgM antibody (Z8E9) was raised against the Na(+)-L-glutamate cotransporter from rat brain. In a preparation of brain plasma membrane vesicles, Z8E9 binds specifically to a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 70,000 and inhibits Na+ gradient-dependent L-glutamate cotransport (up to 50%) in brain membrane vesicles. In the membrane vesicles, the antibody does not alter the membrane permeability for Na+ and K+ nor the Na+ gradient-dependent uptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Kinetic experiments showed that Z8E9 does not alter the K0.5 values for L-glutamate and Na+ activation of L-glutamate transport. However, an apparent cooperativity observed for L-glutamate activation was increased, and the Vmax of L-glutamate transport was decreased. Immunostaining of rat cerebellum identified antigenic sites of Z8E9 in Golgi epithelial cells and astrocytes (by light and electron microscopy), whereas no labeling at nerve terminals was detected. The data suggest that a component of a Na(+)-L-glutamate cotransporter subtype has been identified that is specific for glia cells in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1593955507,"The 135-nucleotide Drosophila melanogaster 5 S RNA precursor is processed by removal of 15 nucleotides from its 3' end before incorporation into the large ribosomal subunit. Mature 5 S RNA consists of five helical stem-loops; stem IV and part of V are dispensable, whereas stem III and the 1/118 G-C base pair closest to the processing site at nucleotide 120 are required for processing (Preiser, P., and Levinger, L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7509-7516; Preiser, P., and Levinger, L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23602-23605). We have investigated the effects of stem I and loop A transversions, transitions, selected additions and deletions on 5 S RNA processing. Stem I single substitutions generally prevent processing, whereas compensatory double substitutions restore a range of processing rates. Proximal to the processing site, stem I double substitutions inhibit processing. In the distal portion of stem I and loop A, the processing effect of paired sequence changes varies widely in an irregular pattern. The 7/112 GU pair and nucleotide 13A least tolerate sequence changes; several mutations clustered close to the stem I-loop A boundary stimulate processing. We interpret these results in terms of the RNA helix path and possible RNA-protein contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1560023148,"To explain our finding that the dimeric beta subunit of tryptophan synthase is only 50% inactivated by beta-chloro-L-alanine (Ahmed, S. A., Ruvinov, S. B., Kayastha, A. M., and Miles, E. W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21548-21557), we have extended our investigation using spectroscopic, steady-state kinetic, and electrophoretic methods. The spectroscopic properties of the half-active beta 2 dimer and the reactivation after alkali treatment show that the inactivation proceeds by an enamine mechanism. Although the fully active beta 2 dimer associates with the tryptophan synthase alpha subunit to form alpha 2 beta 2 complex, the inactive beta subunits in the half-active enzyme associate weakly or not at all with the alpha subunit. Our results provide evidence for two conformers of the beta subunit in solution: one is rapidly inactivated by beta-chloro-L-alanine and the other is not inactivated. Thermal inactivation studies and non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the half-active enzyme show that the beta 2 dimer exists in both homologous and heterologous combinations of these two forms. After removal of the reaction products and unreacted beta-chloro-L-alanine from the half-active beta 2 dimer by gel filtration, further incubation with beta-chloro-L-alanine results in the loss of 50% of the remaining activity. This result suggests that the subunits undergo rearrangement via an intermediate monomer form to regenerate the two conformers of the active beta subunit. This mechanism of rearrangement is supported by our finding that the extent of inactivation increases at lower concentrations of the beta 2 dimer."
