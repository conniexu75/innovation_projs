https://openalex.org/W3049654234,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective vaccine a global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized spike protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and T cell responses, and almost entirely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission and curtailing pandemic spread."
https://openalex.org/W3085955680,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a new human disease with few effective treatments1. Convalescent plasma, donated by persons who have recovered from COVID-19, is the acellular component of blood that contains antibodies, including those that specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies, when transfused into patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, are thought to exert an antiviral effect, suppressing virus replication before patients have mounted their own humoral immune responses2,3. Virus-specific antibodies from recovered persons are often the first available therapy for an emerging infectious disease, a stopgap treatment while new antivirals and vaccines are being developed1,2. This retrospective, propensity score–matched case–control study assessed the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in 39 patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Oxygen requirements on day 14 after transfusion worsened in 17.9% of plasma recipients versus 28.2% of propensity score–matched controls who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75–0.98; chi-square test P value = 0.025). Survival also improved in plasma recipients (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13–0.89; chi-square test P = 0.027). Convalescent plasma is potentially effective against COVID-19, but adequately powered, randomized controlled trials are needed. Convalescent plasma for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is associated with improved survival in a retrospective comparison with matched controls, supporting further study in randomized controlled trials."

Immunometabolic diseases emerge as one of the biggest public health challenges due to the adoption of a high-calorie diet and sedentary lifestyle worldwide (Christ and Latz, 2019Christ A. Latz E. The Western lifestyle has lasting effects on metaflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19: 267-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Metaflammation is a hallmark of immunometabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetes, and obesity (Franceschi et al., 2018Franceschi C. Garagnani P. Parini P. Giuliani C.

Inflammation, metaflammation and immunometabolic disorders.Nature. 2017; 542: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). NASH is a progressive type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which affects ~25% of the world population and is closely associated with other immunometabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia (Neuschwander-Tetri, 2017Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.BMC Med. 2017; 15: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar; Younossi et al., 2018Younossi Z.

Hepatol. 2018; 15: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Therefore, to meet this important challenge of global health, there is a pressing need to elucidate how metabolic disorder is transited to uncontrollable inflammation (Friedman et al., 2018Friedman S.L.

Mitochondria are not only bioenergetic factories, but also dynamic nexus to coordinate signaling networks by releasing metabolic by-products (Rambold and Pearce, 2018Rambold A.S. Pearce E.L.

Fibroblasts are the major source of collagen as well as many cytokines (Kalluri, 2016Kalluri R. The biology and function of fibroblasts in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Despite its central position in fibrosis and inflammation, how mitochondrial signals regulate its functions remains elusive. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), covalently closed at the 5′ and 3′ end, are more resistant to exonucleases than linear RNAs (Chen, 2016Chen L.L. The biogenesis and emerging roles of circular RNAs.Nat. Rev.

A 360° view of circular RNAs: From biogenesis to functions.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev.

Mitochondria contain a maternally inherited, 16.5-kb circular genome that encodes for 13 oxidative phosphorylation complex subunits, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs. Although circRNAs specifically transcribed by mitochondrial DNA have been identified (Jeck et al., 2013Jeck W.R. Sorrentino J.A. Wang K. Slevin M.K. Burd C.E. Liu J. Marzluff W.F. Sharpless N.E.

Cell-type specific features of circular RNA expression.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), the functions of mitochondria-located circRNAs are largely unknown due to the presence of double mitochondrial membranes and the absence of mitochondria-specific circRNA delivery system. Here, we investigate the role of mitochondria-located circRNAs in metaflammation. Fibroblasts orchestrate fibrosis in multiple diseases. Among them, NAFLD affects 25% of the global population (Younossi et al., 2018Younossi Z. Anstee Q.M. Marietti M. Hardy T. Henry L. Eslam M. George J. Bugianesi E. Global burden of NAFLD and NASH: trends, predictions, risk factors and prevention.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2018; 15: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). To investigate the mitochondrial metabolism of fibroblasts in NAFLD patients, we isolated fibroblasts from liver tissues of patients with NASH cirrhosis and those without NAFLD (Su et al., 2018Su S. Chen J. Yao H. Liu J. Yu S. Lao L. Wang M. Luo M. Xing Y.

Commun. 2015; 6: 8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Using Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer, we observed that both extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) increased in NASH fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts (Figure 1A). However, the ECAR/OCR ratio was significantly elevated in NASH fibroblasts (Figure 1B). Consistently, the ECAR/OCR ratio was greatly enhanced in normal fibroblasts treated with palmitate (Figure 1C), which recapitulates lipid exposure in vitro (Machado et al., 2015Machado M.V. Michelotti G.A. Pereira Tde.A. Boursier J. Kruger L. Swiderska-Syn M. Karaca G. Xie G. Guy C.D. Bohinc B. et al.Reduced lipoapoptosis, hedgehog pathway activation and fibrosis in caspase-2 deficient mice with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Gut. 2015; 64: 1148-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Of note, palmitate treatment slightly increased the apoptosis of fibroblasts (Figure S1A). Together, these data suggested that ATP production in fibroblasts switches from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis under lipid burden.Figure S1mROS Is Required for the Pro-inflammatory Phenotype of Lipid-Exposed Fibroblasts, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Palmitate-induced apoptosis of fibroblasts was assessed by flow cytometry.

Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) generated by proton pumps of the electron transport chain is required for ATP production. Therefore, we evaluated ΔΨm by JC-1 fluorescence and found that ΔΨm in NASH fibroblasts was markedly lower (Figures 1D and 1E). Electronic microscopy demonstrated that the ΔΨm suppression was accompanied by the swelling of the mitochondria (Figure 1F), indicating mitochondrial stress. ROS often increases in mitochondrial stress (Shadel and Horvath, 2015Shadel G.S. Horvath T.L. Mitochondrial ROS signaling in organismal homeostasis.Cell. 2015; 163: 560-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated both mROS and cytosolic ROS (cROS) using two approaches, including fluorescent dyes MitoSOX and DCFH-DA (West et al., 2011West A.P. Brodsky I.E. Rahner C. Woo D.K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Walsh M.C. Choi Y. Shadel G.S. Ghosh S. TLR signalling augments macrophage bactericidal activity through mitochondrial ROS.Nature. 2011; 472: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), and transduction with compartment-specific ROS sensors mitoORP and cytoORP, respectively (Dey et al., 2018Dey S. DeMazumder D. Sidor A. Foster D.B. O’Rourke B. Mitochondrial ROS Drive Sudden Cardiac Death and Chronic Proteome Remodeling in Heart Failure.Circ. Res. 2018; 123: 356-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In parallel to ΔΨm suppression, both mROS and cROS significantly increased in NASH fibroblasts (Figures 1G–1J). Similarly, palmitate exposure markedly increased mROS and cROS levels (Figures S1B and S1C). mROS can be released into the cytosol via mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which is an important source of cROS (Dey et al., 2018Dey S. DeMazumder D. Sidor A. Foster D.B. O’Rourke B. Mitochondrial ROS Drive Sudden Cardiac Death and Chronic Proteome Remodeling in Heart Failure.Circ. Res. 2018; 123: 356-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar; Kwong and Molkentin, 2015Kwong J.Q. Molkentin J.D. Physiological and pathological roles of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the heart.Cell Metab. 2015; 21: 206-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Consistently, administration of mPTP inhibitors (cyclosporine A) significantly reduced cROS levels in both NASH fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts treated with palmitate (Figures S1D and S1E). These data suggested that fibroblasts with lipid exposure exhibit mitochondrial stress with elevated mROS production and efflux into cytosol. Although ROS is required for optimal activation of multiple immune cells (Mills et al., 2017Mills E.L. Kelly B. O’Neill L.A.J. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of immunity.Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar; Sena et al., 2013Sena L.A. Li S. Jairaman A. Prakriya M. Ezponda T. Hildeman D.A. Wang C.R. Schumacker P.T. Licht J.D. Perlman H. et al.Mitochondria are required for antigen-specific T cell activation through reactive oxygen species signaling.Immunity. 2013; 38: 225-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), whether ROS mediates fibroblast activation remains unclear. To address this, we treated primary NASH fibroblasts with ROS inhibitors and observed that the contractility (Figure 1K), collagen synthesis, and α-SMA expression (Figure 1L) were abrogated. Moreover, ROS inhibition attenuated the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (Figure 1M). Again, ROS blockade abolished the pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory functions of palmitate-treated fibroblasts (Figures S1F and S1G). Collectively, these results suggested that lipid accumulation increases mROS output, which promotes fibroblast activation. circRNAs are key signaling regulators in multiple cell types (Li et al., 2018Li X. Yang L. Chen L.L. The Biogenesis, Functions, and Challenges of Circular RNAs.Mol. Cell. 2018; 71: 428-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). However, the roles of circRNAs in fibroblasts are elusive. Thus, we compared the circRNA expression profiles between primary fibroblasts isolated from 4 patients with NASH cirrhosis and 4 patients without NAFLD. 15 and 11 circRNAs were consistently upregulated and downregulated respectively in NASH fibroblasts (Figures 2A and S2A–S2C). Strikingly, a large fraction of (4 out of 11) downregulated circRNAs were encoded by the mitochondrial genome (Figure 2B), despite nuclear circRNAs accounting for an overwhelming majority of the whole circRNomics (Figure S2D) (Jeck et al., 2013Jeck W.R. Sorrentino J.A. Wang K. Slevin M.K. Burd C.E. Liu J. Marzluff W.F. Sharpless N.E. Circular RNAs are abundant, conserved, and associated with ALU repeats.RNA. 2013; 19: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). Among them, the suppression of 3 mitochondrial circRNAs (mito-circRNAs) in NASH patients was validated by qRT-PCR in another cohort consisting of 18 patients with NASH cirrhosis and 20 patients without NAFLD (Figure 2C). The fractionation experiment demonstrated that these circRNAs were mainly located in the mitochondria rather than the cytosol (Figure 2D). Divergent PCR followed by sequencing analysis demonstrated that these 3 mito-circRNAs are all generated from the mitochondrial genome through “backsplices” mechanism (Figure S2E). The mature transcripts all contain exonic sequences despite hsa_circ_0089763 having an intron retained between exons. Among them, hsa_circ_0089762 and hsa_circ_0089763 are generated from the light strand of mito-DNA, while hsa_circ_0008882 is generated from the heavy strand (Figure 2E).Figure S2Lipid Exposure Induces Mitochondrial circRNomics Imbalance in Fibroblasts, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A-C) Primary fibroblasts were isolated from 4 patients with NASH cirrhosis and 4 patients without NAFLD, and their circRNA expression profiles were analyzed by microarrays.(A) The number of upregulated and downregulated circRNAs, respectively.(B) Length of differentially expressed circRNAs.(C) The number of differentially expressed circRNAs according to their categories of formation modes.(D) The numbers of nucleus-encoded and mitochondria-encoded circRNAs detected in our microarray were 6121 and 4, respectively.

To investigate these mito-circRNAs, we constructed a mitochondria-targeting nanoparticle (mito-NP) platform. The mito-NP platform contained an endosomal pH-responsive polymer, which can be protonated under the endosomal acid microenvironment, thereby releasing the complexes from endosomes after cellular uptake as we previously reported (Xu et al., 2016Xu X.

The size and zeta potential of the mito-NP were determined using dynamic light scattering, and the encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of the circRNA-expressing vectors was examined as 90.86% ± 3.24% by labeling the vectors encapsulated in the mito-NP (Table S1). The immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that only 12.35% ± 2.35% of GFP signals co-localized with the mitochondria when GFP-expressing vectors were transfected into fibroblasts with lipo3000 (Figures 2G, 2H, and S2F). By sharp contrast, 90.84% ± 2.22% GFP signals co-localized with the mitochondria when the vectors were delivered by incubating fibroblasts with mito-NP (Figures 2G, 2H, and S2F), indicating the specific capacity of mito-NP to target mitochondria. Using this mitochondria-targeting nanoparticle platform, we observed that overexpression of hsa_circ_0089762 (steatohepatitis-associated circRNA ATP5B regulator [SCAR]), rather than hsa_circ_0008882, significantly diminished cROS in NASH fibroblasts (Figures 2I and S2G). Constructing a mitochondria-specific expression vector of nucleic acid that exceeds 5,000 nt is a common obstacle of the current mitochondria-targeting technique (Patananan et al., 2016Patananan A.N. Wu T.H. Chiou P.Y. Teitell M.A. Modifying the Mitochondrial Genome.Cell Metab. 2016; 23: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, we could not construct hsa_circ_0089763 mito-NP. Together, these data suggested that the suppression of mito-circRNAs may play a role in the activation of NASH fibroblasts. Next, we further explored the role of circRNA SCAR in fibroblast activation. Using a specific probe to detect the circular rather than known linear transcript of SCAR in circBase (Figure 3A), RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and co-immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that 90.38% ± 2.56% of endogenous circRNA SCAR signals co-localized within the mitochondria (Figure 3B). Using primers that specifically detected the circular and linear transcripts of SCAR, respectively (Figure 3C), we performed absolute qRT-PCR. Our data showed that circRNA SCAR was 966.37 ± 114.68 copies per normal fibroblast, which was significantly higher than its linear version (443.27 ± 43.69) (Figures 3D and S3A). Both circular and linear SCAR dramatically decreased in NASH fibroblasts (Figure 3D). The ratio of circular to linear SCAR further increased in NASH fibroblasts (Figure S3B). We confirmed that circRNA SCAR was circRNA by RNase R digestion analysis (Figure 3D).Figure S3circRNA SCAR Is Located in Mitochondria and Inhibits Fibroblast Activation, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The linear relationship between the log circular or linear SCAR copy numbers and their CT values evaluated by qRT-PCR, related to Figure 3D.(B) The ratios of circular and linear SCAR expression in normal (n = 6 patients) and NASH fibroblasts (n = 6 patients) were determined by qRT-PCR.(C) Normal fibroblasts were incubated with mito-NP containing empty vectors (Vector) or circRNA SCAR overexpression vectors (SCAR).

https://openalex.org/W3086997468,"The success of a scientist depends on their production of scientific papers and the impact factor of the journal in which they publish. Because most major scientific journals are published in English, success is related to publishing in this language. Currently, 98% of publications in science are written in English, including researchers from English as a Foreign Language (EFL) countries. Colombia is among the countries with the lowest English proficiency in the world. Thus, understanding the disadvantages that Colombians face in publishing is crucial to reducing global inequality in science. This paper quantifies the disadvantages that result from the language hegemony in scientific publishing by examining the additional costs that communicating in English creates in the production of articles. It was identified that more than 90% of the scientific articles published by Colombian researchers are in English, and that publishing in a second language creates additional financial costs to Colombian doctoral students and results in problems with reading comprehension, writing ease and time, and anxiety. Rejection or revision of their articles because of the English grammar was reported by 43.5% of the doctoral students, and 33% elected not to attend international conferences and meetings due to the mandatory use of English in oral presentations. Finally, among the translation/editing services reviewed, the cost per article is between one-quarter and one-half of a doctoral monthly salary in Colombia. Of particular note, we identified a positive correlation between English proficiency and higher socioeconomic origin of the researcher. Overall, this study exhibits the negative consequences of hegemony of English that preserves the global gap in science. Although having a common language is important for science communication, generating multilinguistic alternatives would promote diversity while conserving a communication channel. Such an effort should come from different actors and should not fall solely on EFL researchers."
https://openalex.org/W3085466926,"Summary Many bacteria use the flagellum for locomotion and chemotaxis. Its bidirectional rotation is driven by a membrane-embedded motor, which uses energy from the transmembrane ion gradient to generate torque at the interface between stator units and rotor. The structural organization of the stator unit (MotAB), its conformational changes upon ion transport, and how these changes power rotation of the flagellum remain unknown. Here, we present ~3 A-resolution cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of the stator unit in different functional states. We show that the stator unit consists of a dimer of MotB surrounded by a pentamer of MotA. Combining structural data with mutagenesis and functional studies, we identify key residues involved in torque generation and present a detailed mechanistic model for motor function and switching of rotational direction."
https://openalex.org/W3085585375,"Sensory experience remodels neural circuits in the early postnatal brain through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. Applying a new method of ultrastructural analysis to the retinogeniculate circuit, we find that visual experience alters the number and structure of synapses between the retina and the thalamus. These changes require vision-dependent transcription of the receptor Fn14 in thalamic relay neurons and the induction of its ligand TWEAK in microglia. Fn14 functions to increase the number of bulbous spine-associated synapses at retinogeniculate connections, likely contributing to the strengthening of the circuit that occurs in response to visual experience. However, at retinogeniculate connections near TWEAK-expressing microglia, TWEAK signals via Fn14 to restrict the number of bulbous spines on relay neurons, leading to the elimination of a subset of connections. Thus, TWEAK and Fn14 represent an intercellular signaling axis through which microglia shape retinogeniculate connectivity in response to sensory experience."
https://openalex.org/W3086220523,"Matrix dynamics influence how individual cells develop into complex multicellular tissues. Here, we develop hydrogels with identical polymer components but different crosslinking capacities to enable the investigation of mechanisms underlying vascular morphogenesis. We show that dynamic (D) hydrogels increase the contractility of human endothelial colony-forming cells (hECFCs), promote the clustering of integrin β1, and promote the recruitment of vinculin, leading to the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and metalloproteinase expression. This leads to the robust assembly of vasculature and the deposition of new basement membrane. We also show that non-dynamic (N) hydrogels do not promote FAK signaling and that stiff D- and N-hydrogels are constrained for vascular morphogenesis. Furthermore, D-hydrogels promote hECFC microvessel formation and angiogenesis in vivo. Our results indicate that cell contractility mediates integrin signaling via inside-out signaling and emphasizes the importance of matrix dynamics in vascular tissue formation, thus informing future studies of vascularization and tissue engineering applications."

https://openalex.org/W3087298902,"Synthetic microfibers are found virtually everywhere in the environment, but emission pathways and quantities are poorly understood. By connecting regionalized global datasets on apparel production, use, and washing with emission and retention rates during washing, wastewater treatment, and sludge management, we estimate that 5.6 Mt of synthetic microfibers were emitted from apparel washing between 1950 and 2016. Half of this amount was emitted during the last decade, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.9%. Waterbodies received 2.9 Mt, while combined emissions to terrestrial environments (1.9 Mt) and landfill (0.6 Mt) were almost as large and are growing. Annual emissions to terrestrial environments (141.9 kt yr-1) and landfill (34.6 kt yr-1) combined are now exceeding those to waterbodies (167.2 kt yr-1). Improving access to wastewater treatment is expected to further shift synthetic microfiber emissions from waterbodies to terrestrial environments. Preventing emissions at the source would therefore be a more effective mitigation measure."
https://openalex.org/W3085894443,"As the most visible face of health expertise to the general public, health agencies have played a central role in alerting the public to the emerging COVID-19 threat, providing guidance for protective action, motivating compliance with health directives, and combating misinformation. Social media platforms such as Twitter have been a critical tool in this process, providing a communication channel that allows both rapid dissemination of messages to the public at large and individual-level engagement. Message dissemination and amplification is a necessary precursor to reaching audiences, both online and off, as well as inspiring action. Therefore, it is valuable for organizational risk communication to identify strategies and practices that may lead to increased message passing among online users. In this research, we examine message features shown in prior disasters to increase or decrease message retransmission under imminent threat conditions to develop models of official risk communicators’ messages shared online from February 1, 2020-April 30, 2020. We develop a lexicon of keywords associated with risk communication about the pandemic response, then use automated coding to identify message content and message structural features. We conduct chi-square analyses and negative binomial regression modeling to identify the strategies used by official risk communicators that respectively increase and decrease message retransmission. Findings show systematic changes in message strategies over time and identify key features that affect message passing, both positively and negatively. These results have the potential to aid in message design strategies as the pandemic continues, or in similar future events."

Using a discrete choice experiment, we invited participants to make a series of choices between policy scenarios aimed at relaxing the lockdown, which were specified not in terms of their nature (e.g. whether or not to allow schools to re-open) but in terms of their effects along seven dimensions. These included health-related effects, but also impacts on the economy, education, and personal income. From the observed choices, we were able to infer the implicit trade-offs made by the Dutch between these policy effects. For example, we find that the average citizen, in order to avoid one fatality directly or indirectly related to COVID-19, is willing to accept a lasting lag in the educational performance of 18 children, or a lasting (>3 years) and substantial (>15%) reduction in net income of 77 households. We explore heterogeneity across individuals in terms of these trade-offs by means of latent class analysis. Our results suggest that most citizens are willing to trade-off health-related and other effects of the lockdown, implying a consequentialist ethical perspective. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the elderly, known to be at relatively high risk of being affected by the virus, are relatively reluctant to sacrifice economic pain and educational disadvantages for the younger generation, to avoid fatalities. We also identify a so-called taboo trade-off aversion amongst a substantial share of our sample, being an aversion to accept morally problematic policies that simultaneously imply higher fatality numbers and lower taxes. We explain various ways in which our results can be of value to policy makers in the context of the COVID-19 and future pandemics."

We report chemical refinement of the antiarrhythmic drug mexiletine via high-throughput screening of hiPSC-CMs derived from patients with the cardiac rhythm disorder long QT syndrome 3 (LQT3) carrying SCN5A sodium channel variants. Using iterative cycles of medicinal chemistry synthesis and testing, we identified drug analogs with increased potency and selectivity for inhibiting late sodium current across a panel of 7 LQT3 sodium channel variants and suppressing arrhythmic activity across multiple genetic and pharmacological hiPSC-CM models of LQT3 with diverse backgrounds. These mexiletine analogs can be exploited as mechanistic probes and for clinical development."
https://openalex.org/W3087211081,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor type 2 (FGFR2) has emerged as a key oncogenic factor that regulates gastric cancer (GC) progression, but the underlying mechanism of FGF-FGFR2 signaling pathway remains largely unknown. To identify the potential molecular mechanisms of the oncogenic FGFR2 in gastric carcinogenesis and convey a novel therapeutic strategy, we profiled the FGFR alterations and analyzed their clinical associations in TCGA and Hong Kong GC cohorts. We found that FGFR2 overexpression in GC cell lines and primary tumors predicted poor survival and was associated with advanced stages of GC. Functionally, growth abilities and cell cycle progression of GC were inhibited by inactivation of ERK-MAPK signal transduction after FGFR2 knockdown, while apoptosis was promoted. Meanwhile, the first-line anti-cancer drug sensitivity was enhanced. RNA-seq analysis further revealed that YAP1 signaling serves as a significant downstream modulator and mediates the oncogenic signaling of FGFR2. When stimulating FGFR2 by rhFGF18, we observed intensified F-actin, nuclear accumulation of YAP1, and overexpression of YAP1 targets, but these effects were attenuated by either FGFR2 depletion or AZD4547 administration. Additionally, the FGF18-FGFR2 signaling upregulated YAP1 expression through activating c-Jun, an effector of MAPK signaling. In our cohort, 28.94% of GC cases were characterized as FGFR2, c-Jun, and YAP1 co-positive and demonstrated worse clinical outcomes. Remarkably, we also found that co-targeting FGFR2 and YAP1 by AZD4547 and Verteporfin synergistically enhanced the antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we have identified the oncogenic FGF-FGFR2 regulates YAP1 signaling in GC. The findings also highlight the translational potential of FGFR2-c-Jun-YAP1 axis, which may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for GC."

In the Australian context, the majority of these incidents occur in coastal water ways. This study documents and characterizes bystander rescuer fatalities within Australian coastal waterways that occurred between 1 July 2004 and 30 June 2019 in order to provide suggestions for future public safety interventions involving bystander rescuers. Data was sourced through Surf Life Saving Australia’s (SLSA) Coastal Fatality Database, which collates information from multiple sources. Sixty-seven bystander rescuer fatalities in coastal waterways were reported during the 15-year period, an average of 4.5 per year, which is a significant proportion of the five fatalities previously reported across all Australian waterways. The majority of coastal bystander rescuer fatality incidents occurred in the state of New South Wales (49%), at beaches (64%), in regional or remote areas (71%), more than 1 km from the nearest lifesaving service (78%), during summer (45%), in the afternoon (72%), in the presence of rip currents (73%), and did not involve the use of flotation devices to assist rescue (97%). The majority of coastal bystander rescuer victims were Australian residents (88%) born in Australia/Oceania (68%), males (81%), aged between 30–44 years old (36%), visitors to the location (55%), either family (69%) or friends (15%) of the rescuee(s), and were attempting to rescue someone younger than 18 years old (64%). Our results suggest future safety intervention approaches should target males, parents and carers visiting beach locations in regional locations during holiday times and should focus on the importance of flotation devices when enacting a rescue and further educating visitors about the rip current hazard. Future research should examine the psychology of bystander rescue situations and evaluate the effectiveness of different safety intervention approaches."

We aimed to determine characteristics among all PUIs and those with and without COVID-19. We retrospectively reviewed clinical characteristics and risk factors for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among PUIs at a tertiary care center in Bangkok, Thailand, between March 23 and April 7, 2020. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed. There were 405 evaluable PUIs; 157 (38.8%) were men, with a mean age ± SD of 36.2 ± 12.6 years. The majority (68.9%) reported no comorbidities. There were 53 (13.1%) confirmed COVID-19 cases. The most common symptoms among those were cough (73.6%), fever (58.5%), sore throat (39.6%), and muscle pain (37.4%). Among these patients, diagnoses were upper respiratory tract infection (69.8%), viral syndrome (15.1%), pneumonia (11.3%), and asymptomatic infection (3.8%). Multivariate analysis identified close contact with an index case (OR, 3.49; 95%CI, 1.49–8.15; P = 0.004), visiting high-risk places (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.03–3.56; P = 0.039), productive cough (OR, 2.03; 95%CI, 1.05–3.92; P = 0.034), and no medical coverage (OR, 3.91; 95%CI, 1.35–11.32; P = 0.012) as independent risk factors for COVID-19 among the PUIs. The majority had favorable outcomes, though one (1.9%) died from severe pneumonia. COVID-19 was identified in 13% of PUIs defined per a national health authority’s case definition. History of contact with a COVID-19 patient, visiting a high-risk place, having no medical coverage, and productive cough may identify individuals at risk of COVID-19 in Thailand."
https://openalex.org/W3087138237,"Over the past decade, pastoralists in Kunene Region, Namibia, have endured recurrent drought and flood events that have culminated in the loss of their primary form of livelihood-pastoralism. Most pastoralists are finding it difficult to sustain their livelihoods, and their communities have fallen into extreme poverty. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) approaches are increasingly acknowledged as having the potential to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities. The first step is to develop an understanding of how affected communities live, their perceptions of and how they respond to climate change and the biophysical impacts of climate change in their communities. This study aims to collect this information in order to explore the use of EbA to help pastoralists adapt to climate change. We examined an isolated pastoral Himba community, to understand their perceptions, experiences and understanding of climate change and its related impacts on their livelihoods. A nested mixed-methods approach using structured interviews was employed to address the study objectives. Interview results revealed that pastoralists lack scientific knowledge of climate change, and they have no access to climate change information. Though pastoralists have coping and adaptation approaches at the community level (such as making gardens, fishing, etc.), these have become ineffective as climatic uncertainty and change persist. Furthermore, pastoralists no longer get benefits from the environment, such as food and fodder. Despite this, there are currently no biodiversity interventions at the community level to address the impacts of climate change. Pastoralists have indicated their adaptation needs, particularly the provision of water supply to grow food. This is an open avenue to explore EbA approaches, specifically ecological restoration, while still addressing the need of the pastoralists. There is an urgent need to develop new practical adaptation strategies, including restoration options that will strengthen their adaptive capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3087569138,"The Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (QEESI) is a validated questionnaire used worldwide to assess intolerances to chemicals, foods, and drugs, and has emerged as the gold standard for assessing chemical intolerance (CI). Despite a reported prevalence of 8–33%, epidemiological studies and routine primary care clinics rarely assess CI. To help address this gap, we developed the Brief Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (BREESI)—a 3-item CI screening tool. We tested the BREESI’s potential to predict whether an individual is likely to be classified as chemically intolerant if administered the 50-item QEESI. We recruited 293 participants from a university-based primary care clinic and through online participation. The statistical sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the BREESI were calculated against the validated QEESI. Ninety percent (90%) of participants answering “yes” to all three items on the BREESI fit the QEESI criteria for being very suggestive of CI based upon their chemical intolerance and symptom scores (positive predictive value = 90%). For participants endorsing two items, 93% were classified as either very suggestive (39%) or suggestive (54%) of CI (positive predictive value = 87%). Of those endorsing only one item, 13% were classified as very suggestive of CI, and 70% as suggestive. Of those answering “No” to all of the BREESI items, 95% were classified as not suggestive of CI (i.e., negative predictive value = 95%). The BREESI is a versatile screening tool for assessing potential CI useful for clinical and epidemiological applications, based upon individuals’ past adverse responses in a variety of settings. Just as health care professionals routinely inquire about latex allergy to prevent adverse reactions, the BREESI provides an essential screen for CI. Together, the BREESI and QEESI provide new diagnostic tools that may help predict and prevent future adverse reactions to chemicals, foods, and drugs."

It is well known that mental health nursing education, including clinical placement, is still insufficient to reach the optimal level of competency in nursing students. This study suggests a new form of mental health virtual reality (VR) simulation that is user-friendly and engaging to improve education about schizophrenia, thereby improving its treatment. Method A mixed-methods study was conducted with a total of 60 nursing students, using 360-degree videos of five different scenarios reflecting clinical symptoms of schizophrenia patients and related treatment tasks delivered via head-mounted displays (HMDs). We used a 17-item quantitative questionnaire and a 7-item open-ended qualitative questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use and usefulness of the VR simulation program and to identify areas where further improvement is required. Results The VR simulation program was perceived as useful and exciting. Participants stressed that the high realism of the simulation increased their engagement in and motivation to learn about mental health nursing. Some participants made suggestions, such as further refining the picture and sound quality in order to achieve satisfactory educational outcomes. Conclusion VR simulation using 360-degree videos and HMDs could serve as an effective alternative form of clinical training in mental health nursing. Education could be enhanced by its benefits of being engaging and exciting, as reported by this study’s participants."

In the present study, a total of 711 blood samples from bovines [cattle (n = 543) and buffaloes (n = 168)] from eight farms at different geographical locations in India were screened for C. burnetii targeting the IS1111 and the com1 genes. The anti-C. burnetii antibodies in serum samples were detected using indirect-ELISA kits. Also, a total of 21 parameters pertaining to animal health and farm management were identified to assess their role as possible risk factors for coxiellosis among the targeted farms. The apparent prevalence (positive for PCR and/or ELISA) for coxiellosis was reported to be 24.5% in cattle and 8.9% in buffaloes. In cattle, the detection rate of C. burnetii employing the IS1111 gene (8.5%) was found to be significantly higher (p<0.05) as compared to the com1 (6.5%) gene. The seropositivity by ELISA was higher among cattle (17.7%) than in buffaloes (8.3%). Further, on univariable analysis of risk factors, species (cattle) (OR:3.31; 95%CI:1.88-5.82), inadequate floor spacing (OR:1.64; 95%CI:1.10-2.43), mastitis (OR:2.35, 95%CI:1.45-3.81) and reproductive disorders (OR:2.54; 95%CI:1.67-3.85) were significantly (p<0.05) having high odds for coxiellosis. The multivariable logistic regression analysis of the animal level risk factors revealed that species and age were found to be significantly associated with coxiellosis. However, since the number of screened farms is limited; further research is needed with a higher number of animals to confirm the farm level odds ratio of risk factors. Quarantine and biosecurity measures including farm hygiene operations were observed to be inadequate and also the lack of awareness about coxiellosis among the farm workers. In absence of vaccination program for coxiellosis in India, robust surveillance, farm biosecurity measures and the awareness for the disease among risk groups can play an important role in the disease prevention and subsequent transmission of the pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W3086829397,"The Government of India in-network with the state governments has implemented the epidemic curtailment strategies inclusive of case-isolation, quarantine and lockdown in response to ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. In this manuscript, we attempt to estimate the impact of these steps across ten selected Indian states using crowd-sourced data. The trajectory of the outbreak was parameterized by the reproduction number (R0), doubling time, and growth rate. These parameters were estimated at two time-periods after the enforcement of the lockdown on 24th March 2020, i.e. 15 days into lockdown and 30 days into lockdown. The authors used a crowd sourced database which is available in the public domain. After preparing the data for analysis, R0 was estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) method which is based on the expectation minimum algorithm where the distribution probability of secondary cases is maximized using the serial interval discretization. The doubling time and growth rate were estimated by the natural log transformation of the exponential growth equation. The overall analysis shows decreasing trends in time-varying reproduction numbers (R(t)) and growth rate (with a few exceptions) and increasing trends in doubling time. The curtailment strategies employed by the Indian government seem to be effective in reducing the transmission parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic. The estimated R(t) are still above the threshold of 1, and the resultant absolute case numbers show an increase with time. Future curtailment and mitigation strategies thus may take into account these findings while formulating further course of action."

In this study, we collected wild mushrooms from the Kawauchi Village of Fukushima Prefecture, located less than 30 km southwest of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, to evaluate their radiocesium (134Cs+137Cs) concentrations and the risk of internal radiation exposure in local residents. 342 mushroom samples were collected from 2016 to 2019. All samples were analysed for radiocesium content by a high–purity germanium detector. Among 342 mushroom samples, 260 mushroom samples (76%) were detected the radiocesium exceeding the regulatory limit of radiocesium (100 Bq/kg for general foods in Japan). The median of committed effective dose from ingestion of wild mushrooms was in the range of 0.015–0.053 mSv in 2016, 0.0025–0.0087 mSv in 2017, 0.029–0.110 mSv in 2018 and 0.011–0.036 mSv in 2019 based on the assumption that Japanese citizens consumed wild mushrooms for 1 year. Thus, our study showed that although radiocesium is still detected in mushrooms collected in Kawauchi village even after 5 to 9 years later, the committed effective dose due to consuming mushrooms was lower than 1 mSv per year. Long-term comprehensive follow-up should monitor radiocesium concentrations in wild mushrooms to support the recovery of the community after the nuclear disaster."

Compared to laboratory dogs, little is known about aging in pet dogs exposed to different environments and nutrition. In this study, we examined the effects of age, an enriched diet and lifelong training on different behavioural and cognitive measures in 119 pet dogs (>6yrs). Dogs were maintained on either an enriched diet or a control diet for one year. Lifelong training was calculated using a questionnaire where owners filled in their dog’s training experiences to date. Before commencing the diet and after one year of dietary treatment, they were tested in the Modified Vienna Canine Cognitive Battery (MVCCB) consisting of 11 subtests to examine correlated individual differences in a set of tasks measuring general, social and physical cognition and related behaviours. Fourty two behavioural variables were coded and were subjected to principle component analyses for variable reduction. Twelve subtest level components and two Z-transformed variables were subjected to exploratory factor analysis which resulted in six final factors: Problem solving, Trainability, Sociability, Boldness, Activity-independence and Dependency. Problem solving, Sociability, Boldness, and Dependency showed a linear decline with age, suggesting that the MVCCB can be used as a tool to measure behavioural and cognitive decline in aged pet dogs. An enriched diet and lifelong training had no effect on these factors, calling attention to the fact that the real world impact of nutritional and other interventions in possibly counteracting the effects of aging, should be further investigated in pet dogs living under diverse conditions, in order to understand their ultimate effects."
https://openalex.org/W3086195310,"The expansion of agriculture is a major driver of biodiversity loss worldwide, through changes generated in the landscape. Despite this, very little is still known about the complex relationships between landscape composition and heterogeneity and plant taxonomical and functional diversity in Mediterranean ecosystems that have been extensively managed during millennia. Although according to the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) plant richness might peak at intermediate disturbance levels, functional diversity might increase with landscape heterogeneity and decrease with the intensity of disturbance. Here, we evaluated the associations of landscape composition (percentage of crops) and heterogeneity (diversity of land-cover classes) with plant taxonomical diversity (richness, diversity, evenness), local contribution to beta diversity, and functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) in 20 wild Olea europaea communities appearing within agricultural landscapes of Mallorca Island (Western Mediterranean Basin). In accordance with the IDH, we found that overall plant richness peaked at intermediate levels of crops in the landscape, whereas plant evenness showed the opposite pattern, because richness peak was mainly related to an increase in scarce ruderal species. Plant communities surrounded by very heterogeneous landscapes were those contributing the most to beta diversity and showing the highest functional richness and evenness, likely because diverse landscapes favour the colonization of new species and traits into the communities. In addition, landscape heterogeneity decreased functional divergence (i.e., increased trait overlap of dominant species) which may enhance community resilience against disturbances through a higher functional redundancy. However, a large extent of agriculture in the landscape might reduce such resilience, as this disturbance acted as an environmental filter that decreased functional dispersion (i.e, remaining species shared similar traits). Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering several indices of taxonomical and functional diversity to deeply understand the complex relationships between ecosystems functions and landscape context."
https://openalex.org/W3085028819,"Lower limb exoskeletons and lower limb prostheses have the potential to reduce gait limitations during stair ambulation. To develop robotic assistance devices, the biomechanics of stair ambulation and the required transitions to level walking have to be understood. This study aimed to identify the timing of these transitions, to determine if transition phases exist and how long they last, and to investigate if there exists a joint-related order and timing for the start and end of the transitions. Therefore, this study analyzed the kinematics and kinetics of both transitions between level walking and stair ascent, and between level walking and stair descent (12 subjects, 25.4 yrs, 74.6 kg). We found that transitions primarily start within the stance phase and end within the swing phase. Transition phases exist for each limb, all joints (hip, knee, ankle), and types of transitions. They have a mean duration of half of one stride and they do not last longer than one stride. The duration of the transition phase for all joints of a single limb in aggregate is less than 35% of one stride in all but one case. The distal joints initialize stair ascent, while the proximal joints primarily initialize the stair descent transitions. In general, the distal joints complete the transitions first. We believe that energy- and balance-related processes are responsible for the joint-specific transition timing. Regarding the existence of a transition phase for all joints and transitions, we believe that lower limb exoskeleton or prosthetic control concepts should account for these transitions in order to improve the smoothness of the transition and to thus increase the user comfort, safety, and user experience. Our gait data and the identified transition timings can provide a reference for the design and the performance of stair ambulation- related control concepts."
https://openalex.org/W3086268466,"Introduction After the outbreak of COVID-19 unprecedented changes in the healthcare systems worldwide were necessary resulting in a reduction of urological capacities with postponements of consultations and surgeries. Material and methods An email was sent to 66 urological hospitals with focus on robotic surgery (RS) including a link to a questionnaire (e.g. bed/staff capacity, surgical caseload, protection measures during RS) that covered three time points: a representative baseline week prior to COVID-19, the week of March 16th-22nd and April 20th-26th 2020. The results were evaluated using descriptive analyses. Results 27 out of 66 questionnaires were analyzed (response rate: 41%). We found a decrease of 11% in hospital beds and 25% in OR capacity with equal reductions for endourological, open and robotic procedures. Primary surgical treatment of urolithiasis and benign prostate syndrome (BPS) but also of testicular and penile cancer dropped by at least 50% while the decrease of surgeries for prostate, renal and urothelial cancer (TUR-B and cystectomies) ranged from 15 to 37%. The use of personal protection equipment (PPE), screening of staff and patients and protection during RS was unevenly distributed in the different centers–however, the number of COVID-19 patients and urologists did not reach double digits. Conclusion The German urological landscape has changed since the outbreak of COVID-19 with a significant shift of high priority surgeries but also continuation of elective surgical treatments. While screening and staff protection is employed heterogeneously, the number of infected German urologists stays low."
https://openalex.org/W3087432593,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) links the folate cycle to the methionine cycle in one-carbon metabolism. The enzyme is known to be allosterically inhibited by SAM for decades, but the importance of this regulatory control to one-carbon metabolism has never been adequately understood. To shed light on this issue, we exchanged selected amino acid residues in a highly conserved stretch within the regulatory region of yeast MTHFR to create a series of feedback-insensitive, deregulated mutants. These were exploited to investigate the impact of defective allosteric regulation on one-carbon metabolism. We observed a strong growth defect in the presence of methionine. Biochemical and metabolite analysis revealed that both the folate and methionine cycles were affected in these mutants, as was the transsulfuration pathway, leading also to a disruption in redox homeostasis. The major consequences, however, appeared to be in the depletion of nucleotides. 13C isotope labeling and metabolic studies revealed that the deregulated MTHFR cells undergo continuous transmethylation of homocysteine by methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3THF) to form methionine. This reaction also drives SAM formation and further depletes ATP reserves. SAM was then cycled back to methionine, leading to futile cycles of SAM synthesis and recycling and explaining the necessity for MTHFR to be regulated by SAM.

The study has yielded valuable new insights into the regulation of one-carbon metabolism, and the mutants appear as powerful new tools to further dissect out the intersection of one-carbon metabolism with various pathways both in yeasts and in humans. One-carbon metabolism is a universal metabolic process, in which single-carbon methyl groups are transferred to enable the synthesis of several essential metabolites. These include DNA synthesis (thymidine and purines), amino acid homeostasis (serine, glycine, and methionine), redox balance, and epigenetic maintenance. This carbon partitioning across various cellular outputs involves three different pathways, namely, the folate cycle, the methionine cycle, and the transsulfuration pathways (Fig. 1A) (1Locasale J.W. Serine, glycine and one-carbon units: cancer metabolism in full circle.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13 (23822983): 572-58310.1038/nrc3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Although the centrality of one-carbon metabolism has always been recognized, recent studies have revealed the immense importance of its homeostasis for health and disease (2Ducker G.S. Rabinowitz J.D. One-carbon metabolism in health and disease.Cell Metab. 2017; 25 (27641100): 27-4210.1016/j.cmet.2016.08.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an enzyme that straddles the folate and methionine cycles of one-carbon metabolism. It is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the reduction of methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) to methyltetrahydrofolate using NADPH as the reducing equivalent. The methyl tetrahydrofolate that is formed is then utilized in the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. MTHFR is thus found at a critical branch point of one-carbon metabolism and is one of the key regulatory nodes being under allosteric feedback inhibition by SAM (Fig. 1A). Typical eukaryotic MTHFR enzymes have two domains: a catalytic domain of ∼300 amino acids and an equally large regulatory domain for feedback regulation by SAM (Fig. 1B). The catalytic domain of the enzyme has been extensively studied, and the catalytic mechanism as well as the NADPH, FAD, and substrate-binding sites have been clearly delineated (3Trimmer E.E.

These mutants have been implicated in several disorders such as neural tube defects and pregnancy-related complications, motor and gait disturbances, seizures, psychiatric disturbances, and other neurological abnormalities and cardiovascular diseases and continue to be investigated (5Guenther B.D.

The role of the regulatory domain of MTHFR, however, in contrast, has not been rigorously investigated. This is surprising, considering that MTHFR essentially links the two cycles, and thus its regulation is likely to be important for the homeostasis of one-carbon metabolism. Indeed, the consequences of an absence of regulation by SAM of an otherwise functional MTHFR has been unclear till now. In this article, we describe the isolation and characterization of feedback-insensitive, deregulated yeast MTHFR mutants that emerged from a rigorous search for such mutants. The observation that such mutants show a severe growth defect in methionine medium enabled their characterization and helped to define a region within the regulatory domain that is critical for regulation by SAM, which we established in vitro. Using targeted metabolite analysis, we found that although the folate, the methionine cycle and the transulfuration pathway were affected in these mutants, the major consequences appeared to be in the depletion of nucleotides. Further genetic analysis coupled with 13C isotope labeling and metabolic studies suggested that the cells undergo continuous methionine and SAM synthesis where the ATP and methionine were being continuously recycled. This led to futile cycles of SAM synthesis and recycling and consequently an accentuated nucleotide depletion in these cells. Toward the goal of creating a deregulated eukaryotic MTHFR protein in yeast that would be insensitive to allosteric inhibition by SAM (9Roje S. Chan S.Y. Kaplan F. Raymond R.K. Horne D.W. Appling D.R. Hanson A.D. Metabolic engineering in yeast demonstrates that S-adenosylmethionine controls flux through the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase reaction in vivo.J. Biol.

This region has not been subjected to any systematic investigations so far. The yeast MTHFR amino acid sequence was compared with other eukaryotic MTHFR enzymes. The catalytic domains of these proteins, expectedly, show high similarity (42% identity is seen with the human and yeast protein across the entire catalytic region). The eukaryotic MTHFRs also show a high sequence similarity in the regulatory region, with a 43% identity with the human and yeast proteins, across the entire regulatory region of the yeast MTHFR, residues 337–600 (Fig. S1). Further, within the large regulatory domain, one observes short blocks of high identity across all these organisms. We have defined these regions as conserved region 1 (CR1) corresponding to amino acids 340–361, conserved region 2 (CR2) corresponding to amino acids 440–445, and conserved region 3 (CR3) corresponding to amino acids 517–527 (Fig. 2A). We initially built a homology model of the yeast MTHFR, Met13p, based on the crystal structure of human MTHFR, which has been recently solved (10Froese D.S. Kopec J. Rembeza E. Bezerra G.A. Oberholzer A.E. Suormala T. Lutz S. Chalk R. Borkowska O. Baumgartner M.R. Yue W.W.

Commun. 2018; 9 (29891918): 226110.1038/s41467-018-04735-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The modeled yeast MTHFR structure aligns well with human MTHFR protein with an root-mean-square-deviation value of 0.48 Å (Fig. S2), which exists as a homodimer with each monomer consisting of a catalytic domain and a regulatory domain (Fig. S3). The two monomers are held together by interactions of the regulatory domain, as has been reported for the human MTHFR (10Froese D.S. Kopec J. Rembeza E. Bezerra G.A. Oberholzer A.E. Suormala T. Lutz S. Chalk R. Borkowska O. Baumgartner M.R. Yue W.W.

Commun. 2018; 9 (29891918): 226110.1038/s41467-018-04735-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To predict the SAM-binding residues of MET13, we docked the SAM molecule using a computational docking program, AutodockVina. Among the probable SAM-binding residues, two residues, Glu422 and Tyr404, appeared critical (Fig. 2B). Glu422 is the equivalent of the mammalian Glu463 that is predicted to be involved in binding to SAM (10Froese D.S. Kopec J. Rembeza E. Bezerra G.A. Oberholzer A.E. Suormala T. Lutz S. Chalk R. Borkowska O. Baumgartner M.R. Yue W.W. Structural basis for the regulation of human 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase by phosphorylation and S-adenosylmethionine inhibition.Nat.

In the yeast MTHFR, Tyr404 also appeared to be critical because its benzyl ring can putatively interact with the aromatic ring of SAM around the hydrophobic region within the SAM-binding pocket. These structural predictions, as well as the structural predictions made with the human enzyme (10Froese D.S. Kopec J. Rembeza E. Bezerra G.A. Oberholzer A.E. Suormala T. Lutz S. Chalk R. Borkowska O. Baumgartner M.R. Yue W.W. Structural basis for the regulation of human 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase by phosphorylation and S-adenosylmethionine inhibition.Nat.

These studies had indicated a completely different region of the MTHFR regulatory domain, i.e. within a stretch of ∼30 amino acids starting 30 residues after the junction between the two domains (7Goyette P.

In particular, a 6-kDa region of the protein located at the N-terminal end of the regulatory domain was suggested in these studies to be important for SAM binding (7Goyette P. Sumner J.S. Milos R. Duncan A.M. Rosenblatt D.S. Matthews R.G. Rozen R. Human methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase: isolation of cDNA mapping and mutation identification.Nat.

However, this region was quite distinct from the structural predictions. To identify which regions of the regulatory region might be important for SAM-mediated repression of MTHFR, we targeted both the structure-based predictions of SAM-binding residues and residues within the conserved regions for mutational analysis. We generated independent single-point alanine mutants of both the structure predicted Tyr404 and Glu422, and also targeted multiple residues within the conserved regions (CR1, CR2, and CR3) using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2C). In these regions, we created the mutants M1, M2, M4, M5, and M6. M1 (R344A and T345A) and M2 (R357A and S361A) are present in the CR1 region, M4 (T440A, N442A, S443A, Q444A, and P445A) is in the CR2 region, whereas M5 (T519A and W520A) and M6 (F523A, P524A, and E527A) are the mutations made in the CR3 region (Table S1). These mutants in Met13p, the yeast MTHFR, were assayed for functionality by their ability to complement the methionine auxotrophy of the met13Δ strain. All the mutants were functional based on the utilization of GSH as sulfur source (Fig. 2D). However, when we examined their growth in minimal medium containing different sulfur sources, we observed that MET13_E422A showed a slight defect in growth on minimal medium containing methionine, whereas the M2 mutant (R357A and S361A), which was also functional, showed an even more serious growth defect, once again on methionine medium (Fig. 2D). Neither MET13_Y404A (predicted from the modeled structure) nor any of the other conserved region mutants (M1, M4, M5, and M6) exhibited any growth defect either on methionine or in any of the other tested sulfur sources (Fig. 2D). Because it was possible that a deregulated MTHFR might show a growth defect, we examined this more rigorously by evaluating in vitro the inhibition of enzymatic activity by SAM at the protein level. Accordingly, these mutants were subcloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector, and the purified recombinant proteins (Fig. S4) were evaluated for enzymatic activity and SAM inhibition. We included in this analysis the WT protein MET13_WT, MET13_Y404A and the two mutants that showed a growth defect, MET13_E422A and MET13_R357AS361A (MET13_M2). All three mutants and the WT displayed MTHFR activity. The WT and MET13_Y404A mutant, which did not present any growth phenotype on the methionine plate, exhibited strong repression (∼95%) in the presence of 200 μm SAM (Fig. 2E). However, MET13_E422A, which displayed a mild growth defect on methionine medium, showed only mild repression (∼30%) in the presence of SAM (Fig. 2E). Moreover, in the case of the MET13_M2 mutant, which bears point mutations at two amino acid residues (R357A and S361A) within the CR1 region mutants, we observed an almost complete absence of allosteric inhibition by SAM (Fig. 2E). The MET13_M2 mutant carried two mutations, R357A and S361A. To determine whether the mutation in both the residues together (R357A and S361A) contributed to this phenotype and also whether other amino acids within the CR1 region might be important, we carried out a more detailed analysis of the CR1 region. We made individual alanine mutants for 11 of the conserved residues within CR1 (S340A, Y341A, R344A, T345A, W348A, F353A, P354A, G356A, R357A, G359A, and S361A) and checked their growth on methionine medium. The mutants were functional, as seen by functional complementation of met13Δ strain on GSH supplemented medium. However, the methionine-specific growth defect was observed in the F353A, P354A, G356A, R357A, and G359A mutants of Met13p (Fig. 3A). This analysis of the CR1 region spanning 340–361 residues indicated that the stretch 353–359 seems critical for MTHFR regulation by SAM because residues outside this region did not exhibit any growth defect on methionine medium. MET13_P354A and MET13_R357A, two of the mutants within the CR1 region that display the most severe growth defect in methionine medium, were assayed for SAM insensitivity. The catalytic activity in the absence of SAM for both MET13_P354A and MET13_R357A was slightly higher than the WT protein (Fig. 3B). Additionally, both these mutants retained MTHFR activity even in the presence of the SAM (Fig. 3B). MET13_P354A was partially inhibited (repression, 50%), whereas MET13_R357A completely lacked inhibition (Fig. 3B). The deregulated mutants showed a severe growth defect on methionine plates. The possibility existed that the growth defect of these mutants was unrelated to its activity and was a consequence of the interference of these mutants with some other protein or an unrelated pathway. It was therefore important to establish whether the growth defect of these mutants was due to its unregulated activity. One way of establishing this link was to create a catalytically inactive mutation of the deregulated MTHFR. We therefore first created a mutation of the active-site residue of MTHFR, Glu22 (13Trimmer E.E. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Folate activation and catalysis in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli: roles for aspartate 120 and glutamate 28.Biochemistry. 2001; 40 (11371182): 6216-622610.1021/bi002790vCrossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An E22A mutation led to an inactive MTHFR, as seen by its inability to complement the met13Δ defect (Fig. 3C). We then introduced this E22A mutation in the R357A deregulated mutant background. We observed that the R357A deregulated mutant carrying the E22A mutation no longer displayed the growth defect on methionine (Fig. 3C). This result clearly established that the deregulated mutants displayed the methionine-specific growth defect because of the deregulated property of MTHFR. MTHFR is an enzyme that straddles two cycles: the folate cycle and the methionine cycle. It is also a key regulatory step in one-carbon metabolism. Therefore, it was possible that the deregulated enzyme might impact the metabolic homeostasis of both cycles, although which of the cycles might be primarily affected was difficult to predict. Because MTHFR-deregulated enzymes have not been isolated earlier, we were keen to understand the metabolic consequences. We exploit in particular the acute phenotype seen in the methionine medium for our analysis. We first examined the folate pools and whether cells might be facing folate deficiency caused by the deregulated MTHFR. Although plasma membrane folate transporters have not been reported in yeast, we nevertheless supplemented cells with increasing concentrations of folic acid in the medium. At higher concentrations of folic acid, we observed a significant rescue of growth (Fig. 4A). To further define which folate pools were deficient, we examined the steady-state levels of the different folate pools. Although folate pools are continuously cycling and are also difficult to measure reliably because of their lability, we nevertheless attempted to estimate these pools. Using LC–MS/MS analysis, we observed a decrease in the levels of the substrate of MTHFR, CH2THF in the deregulated mutant, MET13_R357A, whereas pools of the product of MTHFR, CH3THF, appeared to be higher in the mutant (Fig. S5). The levels of these two folate intermediate (CH2THF and CH3THF) indicated increased activity of MTHFR while suggesting that the cells could be facing some limitations in the pools of CH2THF. Interestingly, an increase in the THF pools for the deregulated mutant suggested that the activity of the downstream enzyme methionine synthase (MET6) involving the donation of the CH3 group to homocysteine could be increased (Fig. S5). Because CH2THF, the substrate of MTHFR is essential for the synthesis of nucleotides (purines and thymidine), depleted CH2THF pools would be reflected in depleted nucleotide pools. Therefore, we determined the nucleotide levels in the MTHFR-deregulated mutant strains as a readout of an impaired folate cycle. We observed a striking 10-fold depletion of the cellular AMP, GMP, and CMP pools in the mutant-bearing cells (Fig. 4B). To examine whether external supplementation might rescue the growth, we performed a growth assay by supplementing mutant cells with either adenine or guanine (0.05–1 mm). We observed that adenine supplementation as little as 0.05 mm rescued the growth defect of the deregulated MTHFR mutant (Fig. 4C). However, guanine at even 1 mm did not restore the growth of the deregulated mutant (Fig. 4C). A likely explanation for the inability of guanine to complement the growth defect is the inability of guanine to interconvert to adenine, whereas adenine is able to interconvert to guanine intracellularly (14Rébora K. Desmoucelles C. Borne F. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Yeast AMP pathway genes respond to adenine through regulated synthesis of a metabolic intermediate.Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21 (11689683): 7901-791210.1128/MCB.21.23.7901-7912.2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, the restoration of both would be required to restore cell growth. Although these observations are consistent with the depletion of CH2THF, which is a precursor in nucleotide biosynthesis, the much steeper decreases in the nucleotide levels suggested that folate depletion might be only one of the causative factors. The MTHFR enzyme uses NADPH as the reducing equivalent for the catalytic activity. Additionally, it has a FAD moiety noncovalently bound to it, which is also essential for the oxidoreductase activity. Both NADPH/NADP and FAD/FADH2 derive from adenine pools. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that in addition to the pentose phosphate pathway, the folate pathway is also an important contributor to the NADPH pools in the cell (15Fan J. Ye J. Kamphorst J.J. Shlomi T. Thompson C.B. Rabinowitz J.D. Quantitative flux analysis reveals folate-dependent NADPH production.Nature. 2014; 510 (24805240): 298-30210.1038/nature13236Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Thus, with lower folate and adenine pools in the cells, the pools of the cofactors would also be expectedly lower. Furthermore, with unregulated MTHFR activity, the reduced NADPH pools that are required for numerous anabolic reactions would be further depleted, whereas the specific oxidized FAD pools that are cofactors in many essential enzymes would also be similarly depleted. We measured total NADPH/NADP pools in cellular extracts of transformants bearing either MET13_WT or MET13_R357A plasmid. We observed an approximate 2–3-fold reduction in total NADPH/NADP pools in cells expressing the deregulated MET13 mutant when compared with the WT cells upon growth minimal medium containing 200 μm methionine (Fig. 5A). Deficiency in the nucleotide pools could be responsible for this significant decrease. Further, because NADPH represents ∼95% (ratio of NADPH/NADP varies from 15 to 60) of the total content of NADPH and NADP pools, it indicates primarily a depletion in the reduced NADPH pools (16Zhang J. Sonnenschein N. Pihl T.P. Pedersen K.R. Jensen M.K. Keasling J.D. Engineering an NADPH/NADP+ redox biosensor in yeast.ACS Synth. Biol. 2016; 5 (27419466): 1546-155610.1021/acssynbio.6b00135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then merely replenishing the reduced pools might in itself provide some benefit to the cells. We examined this by replenishing the NADPH pools by overexpression of the ZWF1 gene, which encodes the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) enzyme. G6PDH, the first step in the pentose phosphate pathway, is the major enzyme converting NADP to NADPH, and this is the main NADPH-generating enzyme in living cells (17Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Identification of the structural gene for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in yeast. Inactivation leads to a nutritional requirement for organic sulfur.EMBO J. 1991; 10 (2001672): 547-55310.1002/j.1460-2075.1991.tb07981.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We observed that the coexpression of ZWF1 with the deregulated mutant, MET13_R357A, led to a significant growth rescue (Fig. 5B). These findings confirm that the unregulated MTHFR activity leads to the depletion of the cellular reserves of NADPH, which can be partly restored by the reductive biosynthetic activity of G6PDH. The cofactor FAD that is bound to MTHFR plays a critical role in many other oxidoreductase reactions as well, where it aids in transferring electrons in these redox reactions. MTHFR is a flavin-dependent oxidoreductase that requires oxidized FAD for transferring the electrons and reducing equivalents to its substrate, CH2THF. Because FAD is also derived from adenine, the deregulated cells would have lower total pools of FAD/FADH2 and a higher demand for oxidized FAD. We investigated this possibility by restoring the cellular reserves of oxidized FAD. Fumarate reductase is a flavo-protein and catalyzes the reduction of fumarate to succinate along with the synthesis of oxidized FAD (18Camarasa C. Faucet V. Dequin S. Role in anaerobiosis of the isoenzymes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae fumarate reductase encoded by OSM1 and FRDS1.Yeast. 2007; 24 (17345583): 391-40110.1002/yea.1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Yeast have two fumarate reductase: FRD1, a cytosolic fumarate reductase, and OSM1, a mitochondrial fumarate reductase (19Enomoto K. Arikawa Y. Muratsubaki H. Physiological role of soluble fumarate reductase in redox balancing during anaerobiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215 (12393208): 103-10810.1111/j.1574-6968.2002.tb11377.xCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). We coexpressed the cytoplasmic fumarate reductase FRD1 gene along with a deregulated Met13p and examined the growth on methionine plates. FRD1 overexpression significantly rescues the defective growth of the deregulated mutant on methionine medium (Fig. 5C). These results confirm that NADPH and oxidized FAD, both of which are required for the catalytic activity of MTHFR, becomes limiting in a deregulated mutant of MTHFR. MTHFR links the folate cycle to the methionine cycle that leads to the synthesis of methionine, SAM, cysteine, and GSH. In addition to the sulfur amino acids, cysteine and methionine, which are required for protein biosynthesis, SAM is required for methylation in a host of reactions with lipids, proteins, and DNA. At the same time, GSH is critical for redox home"

There was no significant DID in advanced stage at diagnosis (stage≥II; p = 0.6) or orchiectomy more than 14 days after diagnosis (p = 0.6). For patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy as their first course of treatment, treatment greater than 60 days after diagnosis decreased (DID -4.84%, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.45%, p = 0.005) among patients aged 19-25 relative to patients aged 26-64.

No significant DIDs were seen for stage (p = 0.8) or time to orchiectomy (p = 0.1).Men with testicular cancer had lower uninsurance rates and decreased time to delivery of chemotherapy or radiotherapy following ACA-DCE and Medicaid expansions. Time to orchiectomy and stage at diagnosis did not change following either insurance expansion."

We aimed to review aminoglycoside prescription and additional antibiotic prescribing, guideline compliance and outcomes for children with FN. We analysed data from the Australian Predicting Infectious ComplicatioNs in Children with Cancer (PICNICC) prospective multicentre cohort study, in children <18 years with FN between November 2016 and January 2018. Impact of aminoglycoside use in the first 12 hours of FN on composite unfavourable outcome of death, ICU admission, relapse of infection or late-onset sepsis was assessed using multivariable Cox regression. The study was conducted in Australia where antimicrobial resistance among gram negative organisms is relatively low. Data from 858 episodes of FN in 462 children from 8 centres were assessed, median age 5.8 years (IQR 3.5–10.8 years). Early empiric aminoglycosides were prescribed in 255 episodes (29.7%). Guideline non-compliance was common: in 46% (184/400) of eligible episodes, patients did not receive aminoglycosides, while aminoglycosides were prescribed in 9% (39/458) of guideline-ineligible episodes. Adjusted hazard of the composite unfavourable outcome was 3.81 times higher among patients prescribed empiric aminoglycosides than among those who weren’t (95% confidence interval, 1.89–7.67), with no increased risk of unfavourable outcome in eligible patients who did not receive aminoglycosides. In a large paediatric FN cohort, aminoglycoside prescription was common and was often non-compliant with guidelines. There was no evidence for improved outcome with aminoglycosides, even in those who met guideline criteria, within a low-resistance setting. Empiric aminoglycoside prescription for children with FN requires urgent review in guidelines and in national practice."
https://openalex.org/W3087489025,"The objective differentiation of facets of cellular metabolism is important for several clinical applications, including accurate definition of tumour boundaries and targeted wound debridement. To this end, spectral biomarkers to differentiate live and necrotic/apoptotic cells have been defined using in vitro methods. The delineation of different cellular states using spectroscopic methods is difficult due to the complex nature of these biological processes. Sophisticated, objective classification methods will therefore be important for such differentiation. In this study, spectral data from healthy/traumatised cell samples using hyperspectral imaging between 2500-3500 nm were collected using a portable prototype device. Machine learning algorithms, in the form of clustering, have been performed on a variety of pre-processing data types including 'raw' unprocessed, smoothed resampling, background subtracted and spectral derivative. The resulting clusters were utilised as a diagnostic tool for the assessment of cellular health and quantified using both sensitivity and specificity to compare the different analysis methods. The raw data exhibited differences for one of the three different trauma types applied, although unable to accurately cluster all the traumatised samples due to signal contamination from the chemical insult. The background subtracted and smoothed data sets reduced the accuracy further, due to the apparent removal of key spectral features which exhibit cellular health. However, the spectral derivative data-types significantly improved the accuracy of clustering compared to other data types, with both sensitivity and specificity for the background subtracted data set being >94% highlighting its utility to account for unknown signal contamination while maintaining important cellular spectral features."

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of cytopenia and its associated factors among HIV infected adults on highly active antiretroviral therapy at Mehal Meda Hospital, North Shewa Zone, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional health facility based study was conducted among 499 consecutively selected adult HIV infected patients taking HAART for at least six months from January to April 2018. The study participant's socio-demographic and clinical information was collected using a pre-tested questionnaire and reviewing of medical records by trained clinical nurses. Complete blood count and CD4 T cell count were determined by Sysmex KX-21 N and BD FACS count respectively. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify the independently associated factors of cytopenia and prevalence ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression model with robust error variance to quantify the strength of statistical association. In all cases, a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Out of the total study participants, 39.9% had at least one form of cytopenia, 23.2% had anemia, 13.8% had leukopenia, 12.4% had thrombocytopenia, 11.62% had bi-cytopenias, and only 1% had pancytopenia. In multivariate analysis, cytopenia was independently associated with older age groups, male gender, ZDV based regimen, and CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3.In this study, the magnitude of any cytopenia was 40% among adult HIV infected patients taking highly active antiretroviral therapy and the prevalence increased as the CD4 count decreases. Therefore, these warrant the need for monitoring hematological parameters of HIV infected patients on HAART to reduce morbidity and mortality."

The Anopheles mosquito is necessary for the sexual replication of these parasites and for their transmission to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Imaging of the parasite within the insect vector has been attempted using multiple microscopy methods, most of which are hampered by the presence of the light scattering opaque cuticle of the mosquito. So far, most imaging of the Plasmodium mosquito stages depended on either sectioning or surgical dissection of important anatomical sites, such as the midgut and the salivary glands. Optical projection tomography (OPT) and light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) enable imaging fields of view in the centimeter scale whilst providing micrometer resolution. In this paper, we compare different optical clearing protocols and present reconstructions of the whole body of Plasmodium-infected, optically cleared Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes and their midguts. The 3D-reconstructions from OPT imaging show detailed features of the mosquito anatomy and enable overall localization of parasites in midguts. Additionally, LSFM imaging of mosquito midguts shows detailed distribution of oocysts in extracted midguts.

https://openalex.org/W3087696666,"In the California Current Ecosystem, El Niño acts as a natural phenomenon that is partially representative of climate change impacts on marine bacteria at timescales relevant to microbial communities. Between 2014-2016, the North Pacific warm anomaly (a.k.a., the ""blob"") and an El Niño event resulted in prolonged ocean warming in the Southern California Bight (SCB). To determine whether this ""marine heatwave"" resulted in shifts in microbial populations, we sequenced the rpoC1 gene from the biogeochemically important picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus at 434 time points from 2009-2018 in the MICRO time series at Newport Beach, CA. Across the time series, we observed an increase in the abundance of Prochlorococcus relative to Synechococcus as well as elevated frequencies of ecotypes commonly associated with low-nutrient and high-temperature conditions. The relationships between environmental and ecotype trends appeared to operate on differing temporal scales. In contrast to ecotype trends, most microdiverse populations were static and possibly reflect local habitat conditions. The only exceptions were microdiversity from Prochlorococcous HLI and Synechococcus Clade II that shifted in response to the 2015 El Niño event. Overall, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations did not return to their pre-heatwave composition by the end of this study. This research demonstrates that extended warming in the SCB can result in persistent changes in key microbial populations."
https://openalex.org/W3085881137,"Open research data practices are a relatively new, thus still evolving part of scientific work, and their usage varies strongly within different scientific domains. In the literature, the investigation of open research data practices covers the whole range of big empirical studies covering multiple scientific domains to smaller, in depth studies analysing a single field of research. Despite the richness of literature on this topic, there is still a lack of knowledge on the (open) research data awareness and practices in materials science and engineering. While most current studies focus only on some aspects of open research data practices, we aim for a comprehensive understanding of all practices with respect to the considered scientific domain. Hence this study aims at 1) drawing the whole picture of search, reuse and sharing of research data 2) while focusing on materials science and engineering. The chosen approach allows to explore the connections between different aspects of open research data practices, e.g. between data sharing and data search. In depth interviews with 13 researchers in this field were conducted, transcribed verbatim, coded and analysed using content analysis. The main findings characterised research data in materials science and engineering as extremely diverse, often generated for a very specific research focus and needing a precise description of the data and the complete generation process for possible reuse. Results on research data search and reuse showed that the interviewees intended to reuse data but were mostly unfamiliar with (yet interested in) modern methods as dataset search engines, data journals or searching public repositories. Current research data sharing is not open, but bilaterally and usually encouraged by supervisors or employers. Project funding does affect data sharing in two ways: some researchers argue to share their data openly due to their funding agency’s policy, while others face legal restrictions for sharing as their projects are partly funded by industry. The time needed for a precise description of the data and their generation process is named as biggest obstacle for data sharing. From these findings, a precise set of actions is derived suitable to support Open Data, involving training for researchers and introducing rewards for data sharing on the level of universities and funding bodies."
https://openalex.org/W3086141412,"Invasive pests, such as emerald ash borer or Asian longhorn beetle, have been responsible for unprecedented ecological and economic damage in eastern North America. These and other wood-boring invasive insects can spread to new areas through human transport of untreated firewood. Behaviour, such as transport of firewood, is affected not only by immediate material benefits and costs, but also by social forces. Potential approaches to reduce the spread of wood-boring pests through firewood include raising awareness of the problem and increasing the social costs of the damages incurred by transporting firewood. In order to evaluate the efficacy of these measures, we create a coupled social-ecological model of firewood transport, pest spread, and social dynamics, on a geographical network of camper travel between recreational destinations. We also evaluate interventions aimed to slow the spread of invasive pests with untreated firewood, such as inspections at checkpoints to stop the movement of transported firewood and quarantine of high-risk locations. We find that public information and awareness programs can be effective only if the rate of spread of the pest between and within forested areas is slow. Direct intervention via inspections at checkpoints can only be successful if a high proportion of the infested firewood is intercepted. Patch quarantine is only effective if sufficiently many locations can be included in the quarantine and if the quarantine begins early. Our results indicate that the current, relatively low levels of public outreach activities and lack of adequate funding are likely to render inspections, quarantine and public outreach efforts ineffective."

To evaluate the rate of infection among healthcare workers involved in women’s care. Study design A prospective cohort study of obstetric patients admitted to MBBM Foundation and Buzzi Hospital (Lombardy, Northern Italy) from March 16th to May 22nd, 2020. Women were screened on admission by a questionnaire investigating major and minor symptoms of infection and high-risk contacts in the last 14 days. SARS-CoV-2 assessment was performed by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. Till April 7th, a targeted SARS-CoV-2 testing triggered by a positive questionnaire was used; from April 8th, a universal testing approach was implemented. Results There were 1,177 women screened by the questionnaire, which yielded a positive result in 130 (11.0%) cases. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed in 865 (73.5%) patients, identifying 51 (5.9%) infections. During the first period, there were 29 infected mothers, 4 (13.8%) of whom had a negative questionnaire. After universal testing implementation, there were 22 (3%, 95% CI 1.94% - 4.04%) infected mothers, 13 (59.1%) of whom had a negative questionnaire; rate of infection among asymptomatic women was 1.9%. Six of the 17 SARS-CoV-2-positive women with a negative questionnaire reported symptoms more than 14 but within 30 days before admission. Isolated olfactory or taste disorders were identified in 15.7% of infected patients. Rate of infection among healthcare workers was 5.8%. Conclusions An exhaustive triage questionnaire can effectively discriminate women at low risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of a targeted and a universal viral testing approach. In 15.7% of infected women, correct classification as a suspected case of infection was due to investigation of olfactory and taste disorders. Extension of the assessed time-frame to 30 days may be worth considering to increase the questionnaire’s performance."

Our previous RNA-Seq studies demonstrated that cyclin C represses a subset of hydrogen peroxide–induced genes under normal conditions but is involved in activating other loci following stress. Here, we show that cyclin C directs this transcriptional reprograming through changes in its promoter occupancy. Following peroxide stress, cyclin C promoter occupancy increased for genes it activates while decreasing at loci it represses under normal conditions. Promoter occupancy of other CKM components generally mirrored cyclin C, indicating that the CKM moves as a single unit. It has previously been shown that some cyclin C leaves the nucleus following cytotoxic stress to induce mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis. We observed that CKM integrity appeared compromised at a subset of repressed promoters, suggesting a source of cyclin C that is targeted for nuclear release. Interestingly, mTOR inhibition induced a new pattern of cyclin C promoter occupancy indicating that this control is fine-tuned to the individual stress. Using inhibitors, we found that Cdk8 kinase activity is not required for CKM movement or repression but was necessary for full gene activation. In conclusion, this study revealed that different stress stimuli elicit specific changes in CKM promoter occupancy correlating to altered transcriptional outputs.

Cells exhibit multiple adaptive responses following exposure to cytotoxic agents. The failure to mitigate the cellular damage caused by these stressors can initiate regulated cell death (RCD) pathways (1Fulda S. Gorman A.M. Hori O. Samali A. Cellular stress responses: cell survival and cell death.Int J. Cell Biol. 2010; 2010 (20182529): 21407410.1155/2010/214074Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). One common cause of cellular damage is reactive oxygen that can be derived either endogenously (e.g. elevated respiration, oxidase overexpression) or by environmental exposure to pro-oxidants (2Avery S.V. Molecular targets of oxidative stress.Biochem. J. 2011; 434 (21309749): 201-21010.1042/BJ20101695Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), such as H2O2 or chemotherapeutics (3Martins N.M. Santos N.A. Curti C. Bianchi M.L. Santos A.C. Cisplatin induces mitochondrial oxidative stress with resultant energetic metabolism impairment, membrane rigidification and apoptosis in rat liver.J. Appl. Toxicol. 2008; 28 (17604343): 337-34410.1002/jat.1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). An important early adaptation is transcriptional reprogramming, which directs many molecular processes within the cell. The transcriptional adaptations induced by oxidative stress include the up-regulation of both pro-death and prosurvival genes. For example, oxidative stress stimulates the tumor suppressor p53-dependent activation of genes that promote intrinsic RCD (iRCD) (4Siauciunaite R. Foulkes N.S. Calabrò V. Vallone D. Evolution shapes the gene expression response to oxidative stress.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20 (31234431): 204010.3390/ijms20082040Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, genes encoding proteins mitigating the effects of oxidative stress are also induced (4Siauciunaite R. Foulkes N.S. Calabrò V. Vallone D.

This system allows the cell to balance the amount of damage incurred with its ability to facilitate repairs. In contrast to oxidative stress, amino acid starvation inhibits mTOR, resulting in induction of several genes necessary for cell survival pathways including autophagy (5Schworer C.M. Mortimore G.E. Glucagon-induced autophagy and proteolysis in rat liver: mediation by selective deprivation of intracellular amino acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76 (290994): 3169-317310.1073/pnas.76.7.3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, prolonged mTOR inhibition represses cell growth eventually inducing cell death (6Hua H. Kong Q. Zhang H. Wang J. Luo T. Jiang Y. Targeting mTOR for cancer therapy.J. Hematol. Oncol. 2019; 12 (31277692): 7110.1186/s13045-019-0754-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, the balance between survival and death is influenced by the type, intensity, and duration of the stress that is relayed to the nucleus to impact transcription.

Cyclin C is a component of the Cdk8 kinase module (CKM), which is a detachable and transiently interacting subunit of the Mediator complex (15Bourbon H.M. Comparative genomics supports a deep evolutionary origin for the large, four-module transcriptional mediator complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 (18515835): 3993-400810.1093/nar/gkn349Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The other members of the CKM include Cdk8 or Cdk19, Med12 or Med12L, and Med13 or Med13L (16Borggrefe T. Davis R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. A complex of the Srb8, -9, -10, and -11 transcriptional regulatory proteins from yeast.J. Biol.

Cdk8/Cdk19, Med12/Med12L, and Med13/Med13L are paralogs with similar but not identical functions that are incorporated independently into CKMs, along with cyclin C, in a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry (17Allen B.L. Taatjes D.J. The Mediator complex: a central integrator of transcription.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 (25693131): 155-16610.1038/nrm3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Given this dual role in transcription, it may not be surprising that genetic and epidemiological studies have provided evidence that the CKM can either stimulate or suppress tumorigenesis (18Clark A.D. Oldenbroek M. Boyer T.G. Mediator kinase module and human tumorigenesis.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol Biol. 2015; 50 (26182352): 393-42610.3109/10409238.2015.1064854PubMed Google Scholar). For example, CDK8 overexpression stimulates colon and breast cancer progression (19Eirew P. Steif A. Khattra J. Ha G. Yap D. Farahani H. Gelmon K. Chia S. Mar C. Wan A. Laks E. Biele J. Shumansky K. Rosner J. McPherson A. et al.Dynamics of genomic clones in breast cancer patient xenografts at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2015; 518 (25470049): 422-42610.1038/nature13952Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 20Firestein R.

Accordingly, Cdk8 inhibitors have been developed and tested in preclinical studies, demonstrating a positive impact within multidrug combination regimens (21Di Giovanni C. Novellino E. Chilin A.

Conversely, deleting Ccnc (cyclin C) stimulates hyperplasia in thyroid and acute lymphoblastic leukemia mouse models (18Clark A.D. Oldenbroek M. Boyer T.G. Mediator kinase module and human tumorigenesis.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol Biol. 2015; 50 (26182352): 393-42610.3109/10409238.2015.1064854PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jezek J. Wang K. Yan R. Di Cristofano A.

Interestingly, there is evidence that the CKM regulates transcription in both a CDK8 kinase-dependent and kinase-independent manner (23Menzl I. Zhang T. Berger-Becvar A. Grausenburger R. Heller G. Prchal-Murphy M. Edlinger L. Knab V.M. Uras I.Z. Grundschober E. Bauer K. Roth M. Skucha A. Liu Y. Hatcher J.M. et al.A kinase-independent role for CDK8 in BCR-ABL1+ leukemia.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 (31628323): 474110.1038/s41467-019-12656-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the CKM plays a complicated role in transcriptional control responding to diverse inputs. However, how the CKM itself is controlled to mediate this dual transcriptional activity is unclear. In addition to its nuclear role, ∼15–20% of cyclin C, but not Cdk8, translocates to the cytoplasm in response to oxidative stress (24Wang K. Yan R. Cooper K.F. Strich R. Cyclin C mediates stress-induced mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26 (25609094): 1030-104310.1091/mbc.E14-08-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to inactivating Cdk8 to alter transcription, cytoplasmic cyclin C directly binds both the dynamin-like GTPase Drp1 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bax to promote mitochondrial fragmentation and efficient iRCD execution, respectively (24Wang K. Yan R. Cooper K.F. Strich R. Cyclin C mediates stress-induced mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.Mol. Biol.

This mitochondrial role is conserved in yeast and our laboratory demonstrated that Med13 is required for cyclin C nuclear retention (27Khakhina S. Cooper K.F. Strich R. Med13p prevents mitochondrial fission and programmed cell death in yeast through nuclear retention of cyclin C.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25 (25057017): 2807-281610.1091/mbc.E14-05-0953Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To allow cyclin C nuclear release in response to oxidative stress in yeast, Med13 is degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in a highly regulated process requiring multiple signaling pathways and Cdk8 activity (28Stieg D.C. Willis S.D. Ganesan V. Ong K.L. Scuorzo J. Song M. Grose J. Strich R. Cooper K.F.

Cell. 2018; 5 (30175106): 357-37010.15698/mic2018.08.641Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similarly, structural studies revealed that Med13/Med13L tether the CKM to the Mediator complex, suggesting that its role in retaining cyclin C in the nucleus is conserved (30Tsai K.L. Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Asturias F.J. A conserved Mediator-CDK8 kinase module association regulates Mediator–RNA polymerase II interaction.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (23563140): 611-61910.1038/nsmb.2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the pool of cyclin C is selected for nuclear release in mammalian cells and whether Med13/Med13L destruction is involved. Here, ChIP studies revealed that promoter recruitment or loss of cyclin C and the CKM directly correlated with its role as a transcriptional activator or repressor. This profile changed following starvation stress, indicating that cyclin C and CKM movements are precisely determined by the insult. Finally, CKM integrity was disrupted at a subset of repressed promoters suggesting a source for cyclin C nuclear release. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a model that the CKM is a dynamic complex that directs transcriptional repression and activation through changes in promoter occupancy at target genes. Our transcriptome analysis revealed that cyclin C mediates both positive and negative transcriptional control of genes induced by H2O2 exposure (7Stieg D.C. Chang K.-T. Cooper K.F. Strich R. Cyclin C regulated oxidative stress responsive transcriptome in Mus musculus embryonic fibroblasts.G3 (Bethesda). 2019; 9 (31036676): 1901-190810.1534/g3.119.400077Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To begin investigating this observation, we used Gene Ontology (31Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. Harris M.A. Hill D.P. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Lewis S. et al.Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology: the Gene Ontology Consortium.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 (10802651): 25-2910.1038/75556Crossref PubMed Scopus (25722) Google Scholar) to identify biological processes enriched in the data set for genes induced by H2O2 treatment. We chose to study two pathways, p53-induced genes and those required for autophagy as they represent stresses leading to cell death and survival, respectively. The p53 stress-response genes included Trp53inp1 (tumor protein p53–inducible nuclear protein 1), p21 (Cdkn1a; cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1), and Jmy (junction-mediating and -regulatory protein) (labeled in figures in bold italic font). The autophagic genes chosen were Gabarap (GABA receptor–associated protein) and Prkaa2 (5′-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit α-2) (labeled in figures in underlined italic font). In addition, three genes, Adrm1 (proteasomal ubiquitin receptor Adrm1), Gtf2h1 (general transcription factor IIH subunit 1), and Crebrf (CREB3 regulatory factor), were chosen that were induced by H2O2 but are neither the p53-dependent nor autophagy-responsive genes (labeled in figures in italic font). Finally, Sall1 (Sal-like protein 1) and Col4a1 (Collagen α-1(IV) chain) were chosen as cyclin C–repressed and activated their transcription under nonstress conditions, respectively, but their transcript levels are not affected by H2O2 stress. We first confirmed the transcriptional changes observed with RNA-Seq by RT-qPCR analysis. As expected, the three gene sets exhibited various levels of induction in response to H2O2 treatment, whereas Sall1 and Col4a1 were not affected (Fig. 1A). Two patterns of transcription were observed for cyclin C–activated genes. For the p53-dependent set, cyclin C is required for steady-state levels of Trp53inp1 and p21 but accounted for only partial H2O2 induction (Fig. 1A, left side). The transcriptional analysis of nine additional H2O2-induced genes controlled by p53 identified seven that required cyclin C for activation and two that were repressed during normal growth (Fig. S1). The same patterns were observed in that cyclin C is required for maintaining both steady-state transcription and full H2O2-induced induction. A second pattern was observed for Adrm1 and Gabarap transcription in that cyclin C was required for both steady-state levels and any H2O2-mediated induction. For the cyclin C–repressed genes, two transcription patterns were again observed depending on p53 requirement. Deleting Ccnc resulted in a 4-fold derepression of Jmy mRNA that was not enhanced by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1A, right side). However, H2O2-treated WT cells only displayed a 2-fold elevation in Jmy mRNA, suggesting that the pro-oxidant treatment only partially relieves cyclin C–dependent repression. Similar to Jmy regulation, two repressed genes (Dyrk3 and Noxa) exhibited elevated mRNA levels in the absence of cyclin C beyond that induced by H2O2 treatment in WT cells (Fig. S1). These findings suggest that H2O2 treatment does not elicit the full activation of these loci. A second profile was observed for autophagy-induced Prkaa2 and two additional repressed genes Gtf2h1 and Crebrf. These loci displayed mRNA levels in Ccnc−/− that matched WT H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 1A, right side). Moreover, the addition of H2O2 did not increase transcription in Ccnc−/− cells. These findings suggest that H2O2 treatment was able to remove all cyclin C–dependent repression. Next, ChIP analysis was used to monitor cyclin C promoter occupancy at these promoters before and after H2O2 treatment. For all genes, cyclin C demonstrated promoter enrichment over background in unstressed cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that its control of the transcription at each locus is direct. Antibody specificity controls are shown in Fig. S2 for the Trp53inp1 locus. Following H2O2 exposure, there was a significant increase in promoter occupancy for the two p53-dependent genes activated by cyclin C (Trp53inp1 and p21) (Fig. 1B, left side). Previous reports demonstrated increased promoter occupancy at the p21 promoter by the CKM members cyclin C, Cdk8, and Med12 following Nutlin, but not UVC, treatment (32Donner A.J. Szostek S. Hoover J.M. Espinosa J.M. CDK8 is a stimulus-specific positive coregulator of p53 target genes.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27 (17612495): 121-13310.1016/j.molcel.2007.05.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast, there was a significant decrease in promoter occupancy of cyclin C following oxidative stress for the repressed gene Jmy (Fig. 1B, right side). These results indicate that cyclin C is recruited to promoters when its transactivation ability is employed but removed when its repression function is no longer wanted. Similar increases in occupancy were observed for the activated autophagy Gabarap and independent Adrm1 genes. Likewise, loss in cyclin C occupancy was observed for the repressed genes Prkaa2, Gtf2h1, and Crebrf, consistent with removing CKM repression. No changes in promoter occupancy were observed for the H2O2-independent genes Col4a1 and Sall1. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model that cyclin C recruitment helps direct normal gene induction, whereas its removal is important for transcriptional derepression. To test whether this model is predictive, we examined cyclin C promoter occupancy for a member of an expression class that requires cyclin C for its steady state expression but is downregulated in response to H2O2 (Fig. 1C). According to our model, this gene set should exhibit loss of cyclin C occupancy from its promoter following stress. We tested one member of this group, Angptl4, and found that both cyclin C and Cdk8 were removed from the promoter following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1D). Therefore, changes in CKM occupancy may be predictive from the transcriptional profile (repression vs. activation) and the transcriptional change after stress treatment. Our results indicate that cyclin C occupancy is increased when it serves a positive role in transcription but removed to relieve its repressor function. Biochemical studies purifying the CKM suggest that it is mostly found as an intact complex (15Bourbon H.M. Comparative genomics supports a deep evolutionary origin for the large, four-module transcriptional mediator complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 (18515835): 3993-400810.1093/nar/gkn349Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next asked whether other components of the CKM also display similar dynamic changes in promoter occupancy. ChIP experiments were conducted using antibodies targeting three additional members of the CKM (Cdk8, Med13, and Med13L). Med13 and Med13L were chosen because their individual activities have not been clearly delineated. The results indicated significant promoter occupancy by each of the four members for each gene in WT unstressed cells for both cyclin C–activated (Fig. 2A) and –repressed (Fig. 2B) genes. Following H2O2 exposure, promoter occupancy patterns of the CKM members generally mirrored that observed for cyclin C for each of the induced genes Trp53inp1, p21, Gabarap, and Adrm1 (Fig. 2A). As expected, no change in promoter occupancy for any of these proteins was observed for H2O2-independent Col4a1. For the repressed genes Jmy and Gtf2h1, there was a significant decrease in promoter occupancy of each CKM member in response to oxidative stress similar to that observed for cyclin C (Fig. 2B). However, CKM promoter occupancy at Prkaa2 and Crebrf gave an intermediate result. Specifically, although cyclin C levels were diminished to nearly background levels at these promoters, significant levels of the remaining CKM members were detected (Fig. 2B, arrows). These findings indicate that cyclin C was separated from other CKM components at a subset of the Prkaa2 or Crebrf promoters. Interestingly, ChIP analysis showed that Cdk8 occupancy at the Trp53inp1 promoter was at the limits of detection in Ccnc−/− cells (Fig. S2). These results suggest a different fate for Cdk8 promoter occupancy when cyclin C is completely absent versus removed in response to stress. Together, these data indicate that promoter movements by cyclin C and other CKM components are largely similar, arguing that the CKM moves as a single unit to and from promoters. A potential caveat to this conclusion is the two repressed promoters, Prkaa2 and Crebrf, in which cyclin C and CKM removal appear disconnected. Previous studies have revealed regulatory cross-talk between the oxidative stress and autophagic signaling systems (33Filomeni G. De Zio D. Cecconi F. Oxidative stress and autophagy: the clash between damage and metabolic needs.Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22 (25257172): 377-38810.1038/cdd.2014.150Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been reported that low-level oxidative stress induces autophagy (34Filomeni G. Desideri E. Cardaci S. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R. Under the ROS…thiol network is the principal suspect for autophagy commitment.Autophagy. 2010; 6 (20639698): 999-100510.4161/auto.6.7.12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), whereas amino acid starvation triggers a low-level oxidative stress response (35Chen Y. Azad M.B. Gibson S.B. Superoxide is the major reactive oxygen species regulating autophagy.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16 (19407826): 1040-105210.1038/cdd.2009.49Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). To determine whether cyclin C exhibited coregulation of H2O2- and autophagy-induced genes, WT MEF cultures were treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin1 (32Donner A.J. Szostek S. Hoover J.M. Espinosa J.M. CDK8 is a stimulus-specific positive coregulator of p53 target genes.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27 (17612495): 121-13310.1016/j.molcel.2007.05.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Similar to H2O2 stress, cyclin C was required for both steady-state and Torin1-induced transcription of Gabarap and Adrm1 (Fig. 3A, left side). In addition, two repressed genes, Prkaa2 and Crebrf, exhibited derepression following Torin1 treatment that was similar to those observed in Ccnc−/− cells, suggesting that removing cyclin C–dependent repression was sufficient for maximal induction (Fig. 3A, right side). Interestingly, one gene repressed by cyclin C, Gtf2h1, exhibited reduced mRNA levels following Torin1 treatment (Fig. 3A, arrow). These findings indicate that Torin1 and H2O2 treatment is processed similarly though cyclin C activity, although differences exist. Similar to H2O2 stress, ChIP analysis following Torin1 exposure revealed increased cyclin C promoter occupancy for the induced genes Gabarap and Adrm1 (Fig. 3B, left side). In addition, cyclin C promoter occupancy was reduced at both Prkaa2 and Crebrf promoters. These results are consistent with our model that removing cyclin C from promoters is part of the derepression process. Although the impact of cyclin C is opposite, these data suggest the possibility that a common pathway is used to induce these loci following both H2O2 exposure and mTOR inhibition. However, Gtf2h1 mRNA levels decreased following Torin1 treatment (Fig. 3A, arrow), opposite to that observed for H2O2 stress. Because our results indicate that cyclin C is recruited to promoters demonstrating transcriptional induction, we would predict that its promoter occupancy would also increase following Torin1 treatment to establish additional Torin1-induced repression. ChIP analysis proved this prediction correct with a significant increase in cyclin C promoter occupancy following Torin1 treatment compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3B). Further analysis of the p53-mediated stress-response genes Trp53inp1, p21, and Jmy found no or little change in mRNA levels between control and Torin1-treated cells (Fig. S3A). Consistent with this result, cyclin C promoter occupancy also remained unchanged (Fig. S3B). Our ChIP results from the repressed Prkaa2 and Crebrf promoters suggested a possible source for nuclear released cyclin C following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2B). Similarly, cyclin C is removed from these two promoters in response to Torin1 treatment. However, unlike H2O2 exposure, cyclin C remained nuclear following Torin1 treatment, and the mitochondria remained intact (Fig. 3C). Finally, there was no significant difference in cyclin C levels (Fig. 3D) or iRCD induction (Fig. 3E) in response to Torin1 treatment. These results suggest that not only is CKM promoter occupancy altered in response to a particular stimuli, its integrity may also be precisel"

In this paper we outline and evaluate the Co-Creation processes underpinning a handwashing intervention for young children (A Germ’s Journey) developed and delivered in India, Sierra Leone and the UK, and consider the implications surrounding Imperialist/Colonial discourse and the White Saviour Complex. The paper focuses both on the ways Co-Creation was conceptualised by our collaborators in all three countries and the catalysts and challenges encountered. Qualitative data have been drawn from in-depth interviews with five key stakeholders, focus group data from 37 teachers in Sierra Leone and responses to open-ended questionnaires completed by teachers in India (N = 66) and UK (N = 63). Data were analysed using thematic analysis and three themes, each with three constituent subthemes are presented. In the theme ‘Representations of and Unique Approaches to Co-Creation’ we explore the ways in which Co-Creation was constructed in relation to teamwork, innovative practice and more continuous models of evaluation. In ‘Advantages of Co-Creation’ we consider issues around shared ownership, improved outcomes and more meaningful insights alongside the mitigation of risks and short-circuiting of problems. In ‘Challenges of Co-Creation’ we discuss issues around timing and organisation, attracting and working with appropriate partners and understanding the importance of local context with inherent social, economic and structural barriers, especially in low-and-middle-income countries. We consider how theoretical elements of Co-Creation can inform effective international public health interventions; crucial during a global pandemic in which handwashing is the most effective method to control the transmission of COVID-19. Finally we reflect on some of the methodological challenges of our own work and in managing the potentially conflicting goals of the ethical and participatory values of Co-Creation with pragmatic considerations about ensuring an effective final ‘product’."

Analysis was based on their patent and annual report data and used multiple input-output SFA model, system GMM, and panel fixed-effect model. The results are as follows. (1) There is significant variation in overall technological innovation efficiency of listed companies in the internet industry, and there is a downward trend. The technological innovation efficiency of business that use financing innovation methods is higher than those that do not. (2) The number of patents and intangible capital investment of internet businesses increase obviously every year, but there is no corresponding increase in the efficiency of technological innovation, and little intangible capital investment of non-financing innovation businesses. Thus, determining how to effectively improve the overall quality of patents and the efficiency of intangible capital investment is essential to improve the efficiency of technological innovation for Chinese internet businesses. (3) There is a term mismatch in the investment and financing of internet businesses in China. The financing structure between the financing innovation and non-financing innovation businesses has different impacts on the efficiency of technological innovation. And nowadays, more financing channels are short-term debt financing channels which invest in projects to improve the efficiency of technological innovation due to the pressure of debt repayment and the need to protect shareholders’ interests. (4) In the panel regression, the coefficients of Icd and Roa are significantly negative, suggesting that the investment efficiency of internet businesses needs to be improved."
https://openalex.org/W3087401604,"Goal celebration in sport is mostly spontaneous and is manifested via vocal expressions and bodily gestures aimed at communicating emotions. The aim of this study is to deconstruct the celebratory acts among elite professional football players in the European Champions League following scoring a goal, and to capture the multiple acts and functions of the celebrations. In examining the 2018/19 season of the European Champions League tournament, we draw attention to the players' celebrations and their corresponding social and individual functions. All goals/celebrations (K = 366) were used for the analyses. To analyze the goal celebration acts, a socio-psychological model was established which is comprised of several theories. To describe the goal celebration acts across the competition stages (e.g., preliminary and final), match location (i.e., home or away), time phase (0-15, 15-45, 45-75, 75-90, 90+ minutes), scoring mode (i.e., prior to the goal, after the goal), and players' continent origin (Europe, Africa, Asia, South/Central, and North America), the number and percent of all the celebratory acts were counted and presented in their respective mode (i.e., single, double, and team). The main findings indicate that (a) most of the goal celebration acts were performed interactively by the scoring player and his teammates, (b) the interactive modes of celebration lasted longer than the modes which were performed non-interactively, (c) the celebration lasted longer following goal scoring in the final stage than in the preliminary stage, (d) the celebration duration lasted the longest time when the goal was scored during the overtime phase (90+ min) of the final but not the preliminary stage, and (e) players from Africa and South America demonstrated religious acts more than their European counterparts. We assert that our conceptual model enables the categorization of a variety of personal and social meanings to the celebrations on the field during the most thrilling moments of the game."
https://openalex.org/W3087498410,"Phylogeographic divergence and population genetic diversity within species reflect the impacts of habitat connectivity, demographics, and landscape level processes in both the recent and distant past. Characterizing patterns of differentiation across the geographic range of a species provides insight on the roles of organismal and environmental traits in evolutionary divergence and future population persistence. This is particularly true of habitat specialists where habitat availability and resource dependence may result in pronounced genetic structure as well as increased population vulnerability. We use DNA sequence data as well as microsatellite genotypes to estimate range-wide phylogeographic divergence, historical population connectivity, and historical demographics in an endemic habitat specialist, the dunes sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus). This species is found exclusively in dune blowouts and patches of open sand within the shinnery oak-sand dune ecosystem of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent Texas. We find evidence of phylogeographic structure consistent with breaks and constrictions in suitable habitat at the range-wide scale. In addition, we find support for a dynamic and variable evolutionary history across the range of S. arenicolus. Populations in the Monahans Sandhills have deeply divergent lineages consistent with long-term demographic stability. In contrast, populations in the Mescalero Sands are not highly differentiated, though we do find evidence of demographic expansion in some regions and relative demographic stability in others. Phylogeographic history and population genetic differentiation in this species has been shaped by the configuration of habitat patches within a geologically complex and historically dynamic landscape. Our findings identify regions as genetically distinctive conservation units as well as underscore the genetic and demographic history of different lineages of S. arenicolus."

The goals of this study were to 1) determine if progesterone and total estrogen concentrations in ovarian tissues of female walruses could be used to determine reproductive state and 2) determine if walruses undergo a functional postpartum estrus, as is seen in other pinnipeds. Ovaries were collected from female walruses (n = 13) hunted in subsistence hunts by Alaska Native communities. Females were categorized as postpartum, full-term pregnant, pregnant diapause or unbred. Total estrogen concentrations were greatest in unbred (n = 2) and pregnant (n = 2) females. Progesterone concentrations were also nominally larger in unbred (n = 2) than pregnant (n = 2) and postpartum (n = 9) animals. Small samples sizes precluded the use of statistical comparisons among groups. Corpora lutea tissue samples in this study did not reflect the presence of a postpartum estrus in the month of May as postpartum females yielded lower total estrogen concentrations than unbred or pregnant animals. Both unbred animals were in a state of pseudopregnancy, which has not been physiologically described for this species before. The progesterone profiles in late (59 ng/g) and early (140 ng/g) pregnancy were lower than expected and fell within the range of the postpartum females (36-210 ng/g), suggesting low production of the hormone by the corpus luteum during these phases of pregnancy. Profiling reproductive hormones in free-ranging walruses demonstrates that an endocrine approach may be a valuable tool for determining reproductive status of females, however increased sample sizes and time of year must be considered to accurately separate pregnant versus pseudopregnant individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3087260565,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent for tuberculosis, the most extended infectious disease around the world. When Mtb enters inside the pulmonary alveolus it is rapidly phagocytosed by the alveolar macrophage. Although this controls the majority of inhaled microorganisms, in this case, Mtb survives inside the macrophage and multiplies. A posterior chemokine and cytokine cascade generated by the irruption of monocytes, neutrophils and posteriorly, by T-cells, does not necessarily stop the growth of the granuloma. Interestingly, the encapsulation process built by fibroblasts is able to surround the lesion and stop its growing. The success of this last process determines if the host enters in an asymptomatic latent state or continues into a life-threatening and infective active tuberculosis disease (TB). Understanding such dichotomic process is challenging, and computational modeling can bring new ideas. Thus, we have modeled the different stages of the infection, first in a single alveolus (a sac with a radius of 0.15 millimeters) and, second, inside a secondary lobule (a compartment of the lungs of around 3 cm3). We have employed stochastic reaction-diffusion equations to model the interactions among the cells and the diffusive transport to neighboring alveolus. The whole set of equations have successfully described the encapsulation process and determine that the size of the lesions depends on its position on the secondary lobule. We conclude that size and shape of the secondary lobule are the relevant variables to control the lesions, and, therefore, to avoid the evolution towards TB development. As lesions appear near to interlobular connective tissue they are easily controlled and their growth is drastically stopped, in this sense secondary lobules with a more flattened shape could control better the lesion."
https://openalex.org/W3087325675,"We examined family isolation, economic hardship, and long-distance migration as potential patterns of an extreme outcome of a lonely death: bodily remains that remain unclaimed and are left to the state. This paper combines a unique dataset—Los Angeles County's records of unclaimed deaths—with the Vital Statistics' Mortality data and the Annual Social and Economic Survey (ASEC) to examine 1) whose remains are more likely to become unclaimed after death and, 2) whether population-level differences and trends in family isolation, economic hardship, and long-distance migration explain the differences in the rates of unclaimed deaths. We employ multivariate Poisson models to estimate relative rates of unclaimed deaths by social and demographic characteristics. We find that increases in never married, divorced/separated, and living without family were positively associated with rates of unclaimed deaths. Unemployment among men and poverty among women was associated with higher unclaimed deaths. Long-distance migration was not associated with more unclaimed bodies."
https://openalex.org/W3087300283,"The question of whether infants prefer prosocial agents over antisocial agents is contentious. Therefore, the first goal of the present study was to replicate previous findings regarding infants' preference. The second goal was to assess whether infants are more likely to imitate a prosocial agent than an antisocial agent. We tested 9-month-old, 14-month-old, and 4-year-old children. The study used the ""opening a box to get a toy"" paradigm in which an animal puppet is trying unsuccessfully to open a box and is either helped by a prosocial puppet or hindered by an antisocial puppet. We presented these social events via video, and subsequently administered an imitation task. As an additional control, adults were asked to describe the videos showing the prosocial and antisocial agent. Although most adults were able to identify both agents, the three age groups of children did not prefer the prosocial agent over the antisocial agent, and were not more likely to imitate the prosocial agent. The lack of differences might be explained by methodological issues or by a lack of robustness of the effect."
https://openalex.org/W3087072013,"This study highlights the need for analysis of online disclosure practices followed by non-governmental organizations; furthermore, it justifies the crucial role of potential correlates of online disclosure practices followed by non-governmental organizations. We propose a novel index for analyzing the extent of online disclosure of non-governmental organizations (NGO). Using the information stored in an auxiliary variable, we propose a new estimator for gauging the average value of the proposed index. Our approach relies on the use of two factors: imperfect ranked-set sampling procedure to link the auxiliary variable with the study variable, and an NGO disclosure index under simple random sampling that uses information only about the study variable. Relative efficiency of the proposed index is compared with the conventional estimator for the population average under the imperfect ranked-set sampling scheme. Mathematical conditions required for retaining the efficiency of the proposed index, in comparison to the imperfect ranked set sampling estimator, are derived. Numerical scrutiny of the relative efficiency, in response to the input variables, indicates; if the variance of the NGO disclosure index is less than the variance of the estimator under imperfect ranked set sampling, then the proposed index is universally efficient compared to the estimator under imperfect ranked set sampling. If the condition on variances is unmet, even then the proposed estimator remains efficient if majority of the NGO share online data on the auxiliary variable. This work can facilitate nonprofit regulation in the countries where most of the non-governmental organizations maintain their websites."
