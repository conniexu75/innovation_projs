If, however, 3 months after injection the rats were subjected to repeated laparotomy and liver examination at 7-day intervals, 100 percent had a tumor within a few weeks."

https://openalex.org/W98622325,"It has been previously demonstrated (1) that particulate preparations from Phase&s uureus (mung bean) seedlings are capable of catalyzing the formation of uridine diphosphate-ngalacturonic acid1 and a mixture of UDP-n-xylose and UDP-Larabinose from UDP-n-glucuronic acid. The results indicated that the preparations contained UDP-uranic acid 4-epimerase and UDP-uranic acid decarboxylase activities. However, the individual reactions involved were not investigated. The work reported in this paper shows that three enzyme systems are operative in the conversions: a UDP-n-galacturonic acid-4-epimerase, a UDP-n-glucuronic acid decarboxylase, and a UDP-L-arabinose-4-epimerase. The enzyme systems catalyzing these reactions have been partially separated and the equilibrium constants have been determined for the two epimerization reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2090898129,"Two distinct but related pathways of protection against the lethal effects of ozone and nitrogen dioxide are shown by (i) simultaneous inhalation of compounds that furnish -SH or -SS-, or both, and (ii) by injection of thiourea derivatives several days prior to exposure to these oxidant gases. The mechanism of (i) is believed similar to that proposed for the action of radiation-protective compounds; that of (ii) involves the development of a tolerance initiated by the thiourea against the oxidants."

The capsule is smaller and simpler than a battery-powered capsule, and has a relatively unlimited life. The pressure records are similar to those obtained by other sensing devices."

Results from the radiochemical analysis of a large number of samples and meteorological interpretation of the data are presented. The strontium-90 content of the stratosphere was found to vary markedly with latitude and altitude. The total stratospheric inventory of strontium-90 was calculated by integrating the specific activities over the entire stratosphere. The residence half-time of nuclear debris in the stratosphere was calculated by comparing the measured stratospheric inventory of strontium-90 with estimates of the total quantity injected into the stratosphere since the testing of nuclear weapons began. A calculation was also made of the strontium-90 concentrations in human bones to be expected in the future if the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere is not resumed. Data from the highaltitude sampling program have also shed some light on the rates of mixing of stratospheric air. Findings are summarized briefly. (C.H.)"

Typhoid O antibodies and rheumatoid factor were only in fraction 5, composed principally of gamma macroglobulins with ultracentrifugal sedimentation coefficients of 18 S. In contrast isohemagglutinins, Rh antibodies, and anti-human liver nucleoprotein activities were found in two chromatogram fractions (1 and 5) with different physicochemical properties."

Since BAS, a tranquilizing agent, and Marsilid, a psychoenergizer, are both monoamine oxidase inhibitors, doubt is cast upon the hypothesis, that the stimulatory effect of Marsilid is due to its ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase."

The graphite moderated reactor uses 17 uranium-235 fuel elements and is cooled by natural water. Vertically moving shutters weighing 2O.tons are provided to control neutron and other radiation emission through special parts into shielded rooms where studies on neutron capture therapy are conducted.

This preparation, which was free of succinic dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase activity, had an estimated deltaE(1 cm)(1g/ml) of 102 for its alpha-peak. In the reduced form absorption maxima were found at 560 to 562, 530 to 532, and 427 to 428 mmicro, and in the oxidized form, at 413 mmicro."

https://openalex.org/W2005636526,"IT is a well-established fact that chlorothiazide potentiates the hypotensive effects of ganglion-blocking agents1–2. However, the way this potentiation is brought about is not clear. It has been thought that chlorothiazide acts either by a direct hypotensive action2, or by sodium depletion3, or by reduction in plasma-volume3, or as in the case of mecamilamine and possibly of pempidine, by a reduction in renal excretion4 of the ganglion-blocking agents. From a pharmacological view-point there is a good deal of similarity between the neuromuscular junction and the gangliarsynapsis."

This ability was present in all sera except those of two of three great northern pike. The effect was destroyed by exposure to 53 degrees C, 56 degrees C, or zymosan. Complement was demonstrated in all sera except that from one great northern pike, when rabbit erythrocytes were used in the indicator system."

https://openalex.org/W2065901963,A METHOD for reducing the fall-out content of milk has been investigated. This is a preliminary report on the results obtained in a short-term study in this area. There are to-day commercially available ‘grass incubators’ which hydroponically germinate various grains to be used as a substitute for fresh pasturage. It is claimed that the product of these incubators fed to cattle on dry lot maintains the cows in a high production of superior-quality milk to an extent which makes the purchase of such incubators economically desirable. The increased use of these feeding systems in this area raised the question to us concerning the effect this substituted diet may have on the radioactive content of milk.
