https://openalex.org/W2007242343,"During the development of the mammalian brain, neuronal precursors migrate to their final destination from their site of birth in the ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ and SVZ, respectively). SVZ cells in the walls of the lateral ventricle continue to proliferate in the brain of adult mice and can generate neurons in vitro, but their fate in vivo is unknown. Here SVZ cells from adult mice that carry a neuronal-specific transgene were grafted into the brain of adult recipients. In addition, the fate of endogenous SVZ cells was examined by microinjection of tritiated thymidine or a vital dye that labeled a discrete population of SVZ cells. Grafted and endogenous SVZ cells in the lateral ventricle of adult mice migrate long distances and differentiate into neurons in the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W2094472942,"Sib-pair analysis of 170 individuals from 11 Amish families revealed evidence for linkage of five markers in chromosome 5q31.1 with a gene controlling total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration. No linkage was found between these markers and specific IgE antibody concentrations. Analysis of total IgE within a subset of 128 IgE antibody-negative sib pairs confirmed evidence for linkage to 5q31.1, especially to the interleukin-4 gene (IL4). A combination of segregation and maximum likelihood analyses provided further evidence for this linkage. These analyses suggest that IL4 or a nearby gene in 5q31.1 regulates IgE production in a nonantigen-specific (noncognate) fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2088988430,"We describe a universal ligand-binding receptor for human interferons alpha and interferon beta (type I IFNs). A soluble 40 kDa IFN-alpha/beta receptor (p40) that blocks the activity of type I IFNs was purified from urine and sequenced. Antibodies raised against p40 completely block the activity of several type I IFNs and immuno-precipitate both a cellular 102 kDa IFN-alpha/beta receptor and its cross-linked complexes with IFN-alpha 2. The receptor is a disulfide-linked dimer, consisting of 51 kDa subunits. We isolated and expressed a 1.5 kb cDNA, coding for the IFN-alpha/beta receptor. Its 331 amino acid sequence includes a leader and a transmembrane region, while its ectodomain corresponds to p40. IFN-alpha/beta receptor is physically associated with the cytoplasmic Tyr kinase JAK1, hence, in addition to ligand binding, it is directly involved in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1526841021,"The vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a major substrate for cAMP-dependent- (cAK) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) in human platelets and other cardiovascular cells. To identify the VASP phosphorylation sites, purified VASP was phosphorylated by either protein kinase and subjected to trypsin, V8 and Lys-C proteolysis. The phosphorylated proteolytic fragments obtained were separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Sequence analysis of the phosphorylated peptides and 32P measurement of the released 32P-labeled amino acids revealed three phosphorylation sites: a serine 1-containing site (LRKVSKQEEA), a serine 2-containing site (HIERRVSNAG), and a threonine-containing site (MNAVLARRRKATQVGE). Additional experiments with purified VASP demonstrated that both cAK and cGK phosphorylated serine 2 rapidly and the threonine residue slowly, whereas cGK phosphorylated the serine 1 residue more rapidly than the cAK. These differences in the phosphorylation rates of VASP by the two protein kinases were also observed with synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequences of the three identified phosphorylation sites. These experiments also established the synthetic peptide serine 1 as one of the best in vitro cGK substrates and the serine 2-containing site as the site responsible for the phosphorylation-induced mobility shift of VASP in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Experiments with 32P-labeled platelets provided evidence that VASP is phosphorylated at the same three identified sites also in intact cells and that selective activation of cAK or cGK primarily increased the phosphorylation of both serine 2 and serine 1 but not threonine. Our results demonstrated overlapping substrate specificities of cAK and cGK in vitro and in intact cells. However, important quantitative and qualitative differences between cAK- and cGK-mediated phosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein VASP in human platelets were also observed, suggesting distinct functions of the two types of cyclic nucleotide-mediated VASP phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1973095653,"The crystal structure of a MyoD basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain-DNA complex has been solved and refined at 2.8 A resolution. This structure proves that bHLH and bHLH-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) proteins are remarkably similar; it helps us understand subtle differences in binding preferences for these proteins; and it has surprising implications for our understanding of transcription. Specifically, Ala-114 and Thr-115, which are required for positive control in the myogenic proteins, are buried at the protein-DNA interface. These residues are not available for direct protein-protein contacts, but they may determine the conformation of Arg-111. Comparisons with Max suggest that the conformation of this arginine, which is different in the two structures, may play an important role in myogenic transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2093065038,"A gene involved in psoriasis susceptibility was localized to the distal region of human chromosome 17q as a result of a genome-wide linkage analysis with polymorphic microsatellites and eight multiply affected psoriasis kindreds. In the family which showed the strongest evidence for linkage, the recombination fraction between a psoriasis susceptibility locus and D17S784 was 0.04 with a maximum two-point lod score of 5.33. There was also evidence for genetic heterogeneity and although none of the linked families showed any association with HLA-Cw6, two unlinked families showed weak levels of association. This study demonstrates that in some families, psoriasis susceptibility is due to variation at a single major genetic locus other than the human lymphocyte antigen locus."
https://openalex.org/W2006958480,"The retinal bipolar cell receiving glutamate transmission from photoreceptors mediates a key process in segregating visual signals into ON center and OFF center pathways. This transmission involves a G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). Immunocytochemical and immunoelectron microscopic studies indicate the restricted localization of a specific mGluR subtype, mGluR6, at the postsynaptic site of the rat rod bipolar cell. This specialization is developmentally regulated: mGluR6 is initially distributed in both the soma and dendrites and is finally concentrated on the postsynaptic site. The mGluR6 localization is reversed when photoreceptors degenerate in the mutant rat with retinal dystrophy. Evidence is thus presented indicating specialized, developmentally regulated receptor distribution in the central nervous system and the crucial role of mGluR6 in photoreceptor-bipolar cell synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1615935414,"GLUT4 glucose transporter content and glucose transport capacity are closely correlated in skeletal muscle. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a rapid increase in GLUT4 expression occurs as part of the early adaptive response of muscle to exercise and serves to enhance glycogen storage. Rats exercised by swimming had a approximately 2-fold increase in GLUT4 mRNA and a 50% increase in GLUT4 protein expression in epitrochlearis muscle 16 h after one prolonged exercise session. After a 2nd day of exercise, muscle GLUT4 protein was increased further to approximately 2-fold while there was no additional increase in GLUT4 mRNA. Muscle hexokinase activity also doubled in response to 2 days of exercise. Glucose transport activity maximally stimulated with insulin, contractions, or hypoxia was increased roughly in proportion to the adaptive increase in GLUT4 protein in epitrochlearis muscles. Treatment with insulin prior to subcellular fractionation of muscle resulted in a approximately 2-fold greater increase in GLUT4 content of a plasma membrane fraction in the 2-day swimmers than in controls. When epitrochlearis muscles were incubated with glucose and insulin, glycogen accumulation over 3 h was twice as great in muscles from 2-day swimmers as in control muscles. Our results show that a rapid increase in GLUT4 expression is an early adaptive response of muscle to exercise. This adaptation appears to be mediated by pretranslational mechanisms. We hypothesize that the physiological role of this adaptation is to enhance replenishment of muscle glycogen stores."
https://openalex.org/W2062452071,"We have identified a Drosophila gene, peanut (pnut), that is related in sequence to the CDC3, CDC10, CDC11, and CDC12 genes of S. cerevisiae. These genes are required for cytokinesis, and their products are present at the bud neck during cell division. We find that pnut is also required for cytokinesis: in pnut mutants, imaginal tissues fail to proliferate and instead develop clusters of large, multinucleate cells. Pnut protein is localized to the cleavage furrow of dividing cells during cytokinesis and to the intercellular bridge connecting postmitotic daughter cells. In addition to its role in cytokinesis, pnut displays genetic interactions with seven in absentia, a gene required for neuronal fate determination in the compound eye, suggesting that pnut may have pleiotropic functions. Our results suggest that this class of proteins is involved in aspects of cytokinesis that have been conserved between flies and yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1651950734,"A replication error (RER+) phenotype, characterized by somatic instability in simple repeated sequences, is associated with several types of cancer. To determine if a defect in DNA replication fidelity or repair of replication errors might explain this instability, we compared both processes in cell-free extracts from RER+ endometrial and colorectal cancer cell lines to RER- cell lines. SV40 origin-dependent replication of a microsatellite sequence is highly accurate in cell extracts regardless of their RER phenotype. However, extracts from RER+ cell lines are defective in mismatch repair, while extracts of RER- cell lines are not. Lack of repair was observed when the signal (a nick) for strand-specific repair was either 3' or 5' to the mispair. One colorectal cancer cell line contained deletions in both alleles of the putative mismatch repair gene hMSH2, and one endometrial cancer cell line contained a 4-base pair duplication in one hMSH2 allele. No hMSH2 mutation was detected in the other allele or in the other five RER+ cell lines. Repair was readily detected when each of the defective extracts was mixed with a repair-proficient extract, demonstrating that no trans-acting inhibitor is present. Attempts to complement the repair deficiencies by mixing two different defective extracts identified three combinations that restored repair. The data suggest that: (i) defective repair is associated with colorectal and endometrial cancer and, by extrapolation, with other types of cancer; (ii) mutations in the hMSH2 gene, and possibly other genes, result in defective mismatch repair; (iii) the defect(s) in these lines likely involves pre-incision events or the excision step, but not the incision, polymerization, or ligation steps; and (iv) at least four functional complementation groups for mismatch repair may be involved in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1976434141,"A predictive rule for protein folding is presented that involves two recurrent glycine-based motifs that cap the carboxyl termini of alpha helices. In proteins, helices that terminated in glycine residues were found predominantly in one of these two motifs. These glycine structures had a characteristic pattern of polar and apolar residues. Visual inspection of known helical sequences was sufficient to distinguish the two motifs from each other and from internal glycines that fail to terminate helices. These glycine motifs--in which the local sequence selects between available structures--represent an example of a stereochemical rule for protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W1993651324,"The solution structure of the C-terminal SH2 domain of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1), in complex with a phosphopeptide corresponding to its Tyr-1021 high affinity binding site on the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The topology of the SH2-phosphopeptide complex is similar to previously reported Src and Lck SH2 complexes. However, the binding site for residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (pTyr) is an extended groove that contacts peptide residues at the +1 to +6 positions relative to the pTyr. This striking difference from Src and Lck reflects the fact that the PLC-gamma 1 complex involves binding of a phosphopeptide with predominantly hydrophobic residues C-terminal to the pTyr and therefore serves as a prototype for a second class of SH2-phosphopeptide interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2128462886,"UV irradiation of mammalian cells activates AP-1 through a Ras-dependent pathway, independently of DNA damage. We show that the yeast S. cerevisiae has a remarkably similar UV response involving the AP-1 factor Gcn4, which is distinct from the DNA damage response. Transcriptional activation of HIS3 and HIS4 by Gcn4 is triggered by UV irradiation in a Ras-dependent fashion. Moreover, resistance of yeast to UV irradiation is correlated with the level of Ras activity and Gcn4 function. Like mammalian cells in which activated Ras leads to increased c-Jun synthesis and phosphorylation, the effects in yeast involve increased translation of GCN4 mRNA and a posttranslational event. However, this effect on GCN4 translation is different from the response to amino acid or purine starvation. Therefore, a UV signaling pathway involving Ras and AP-1 is an ancient and universal mechanism involved in protection against damage to cellular components other than DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1516353866,"Among a series of adhesion molecules, expression of integrin alpha 4 beta 1 showed a unique inverse correlation with the invasive potential of B16 melanoma cell lines. When an alpha 4 cDNA was introduced into an alpha 4-beta 1+ highly invasive melanoma line, alpha 4 beta 1 heterodimers were expressed on the surface. Matrigel invasion by the alpha 4+ beta 1+ cells was reduced. Pulmonary metastasis was also suppressed when the transfectants were placed subcutaneously, but not when injected intravenously. Expression of alpha 4 beta 1 promoted homotypic intercellular adhesion. The homotypic adhesion was abrogated, and the alpha 4+ beta 1+ (less invasive cell lines) increased matrigel invasion following the anti-alpha 4 MAb treatment. These results suggest that integrin alpha 4 beta 1 could play a role in controlling melanoma cell metastasis at the invasive stage."
https://openalex.org/W2028305113,"Xenopus UBF (xUBF) interacts with DNA by way of multiple HMG-box domains. When xUBF binds to the ribosomal promoter, the carboxyl-terminal acidic tail and amino-terminal HMG-box interact. Binding also leads to negative DNA supercoiling and the formation of a disk-like structure, the enhancesome. Within the enhancesome, an xUBF dimer makes a low-density protein core around which DNA is looped into a single 180-base pair turn, probably by in-phase bending. The enhancesome structure suggests a mechanism for xUBF-dependent recruitment of the TATA box-binding protein complex without direct interaction between the two factors."
https://openalex.org/W1597488164,"Generation of reactive oxygen species from mitochondrial respiration has been proposed as an important determinant of longevity and cumulative cancer risk. Interspecies correlations and animal calorie restriction studies of metabolic rate and oxidative DNA damage support this notion. In the present study we have demonstrated a close association between oxidative DNA damage as assessed by the urinary excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihdro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and oxygen consumption in 33 healthy premenopausal women (r = 0.64; p = 0.00007). In the 12 women who smoked, 8-oxodG excretion was increased by 35%, although oxygen consumption increased only 10% compared with the 21 nonsmoking women. Apparently, the rate of oxidative DNA damage relates to mitochondrial respiration in humans and is aggravated by smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2010928027,"The topology of E. coli inner membrane proteins depends primarily on the distribution of positively charged residues in the molecule. We have constructed model proteins with four potential transmembrane stretches and have systematically explored the topological effects of lysines placed in the loops connecting the transmembrane spans. Our results indicate that membrane insertion is locally determined, with individual “helical hairpins” inserting independently of each other. Topologically “frustrated” molecules, where the charge distribution is such that different parts of the molecule would prefer to insert with incompatible orientations, adopt “leave-one-out” topologies in which only 3 of the 4 potential transmembrane stretches span the membrane. These results are relevant for our general understanding of both membrane protein blogenesis and the evolution of multispanning membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1647773117,"Glucose stimulation of islet beta-cell insulin secretion is initiated by membrane depolarization and an elevation in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) from a combination of influx through depolarization-activated Ca2+ channels and intracellular Ca2+ store release. Prevention of Ca2+ store refilling with thapsigargin produced a sustained depolarization, leading to enhanced Ca2+ influx and an elevation in [Ca2+]i in 12 mM glucose. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by external EGTA reduced [Ca2+]i and also caused a long-lasting depolarization. In single beta-cells, external EGTA activated an inward current, the voltage range and kinetic properties of which differed from those of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. A novel pathway thus exists in beta-cells by which depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores results in the activation of an inward current that, by inducing depolarization, facilitates Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The physiological relevance of this pathway in the control of beta-cell function is indicated by the stimulation of insulin secretion by thapsigargin."
https://openalex.org/W2170117494,"Xenopus early development is characterized by a generalized absence of transcription, which resumes at the midblastula transition (MBT). We analyzed this regulation using a plasmid containing the c-myc promoter that is under the same developmental control when injected into fertilized eggs. We find that the repression of transcription can be relieved simply by preincubating the reporter plasmid with TATA binding protein (TBP). However, the repression of gene activity normally occurring before the MBT soon becomes dominant over this activation independent of cell cycle phases. This inactivation correlates with chromatin assembly, and titration of chromatin components not only relieves repression of TBP-dependent transcription but also permits the establishment of stable transcription during early development. Our data suggest that the large excess of histones represses gene activity during early development through a dynamic competition between chromatin assembly and transcription complex assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1602715853,"We showed previously that the abundance of serum albumin mRNA is decreased in H4-II-E rat hepatoma cells limited for a single essential amino acid (phenylalanine, methionine, leucine, or tryptophan). To define the specificity of this phenomenon, we examined the effect of amino acid limitation on the abundance of mRNAs for 19 genes in the H4-II-E cells. These genes included six genes whose expression is either completely liver-specific or highly enriched in the liver compared with other tissues [albumin, transthyretin (TTR), transferrin, carbamyl phosphate synthetase-I, urate oxidase, class I alcohol dehydrogenase], as well as a number of ubiquitously expressed ""housekeeping"" genes. The results indicated that the 19 genes could be divided into three classes based on their response to amino acid limitation. Class I genes (the six liver-specific genes and alpha-tubulin) exhibit decreased expression in response to amino acid limitation. The expression of class II genes [beta 2-microglobulin, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), H-ferritin, ubiquitin (UbB), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4, HNF-1 alpha] is not significantly affected by amino acid limitation. Class III genes [gadd153, beta-actin, ubiquitin (UbC), phosphoglycerate kinase-1, C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta] exhibit increased expression in response to amino acid limitation. Thus, specific inductive as well as repressive effects on gene expression are quite common in amino acid-limited cells. The observation that all six genes whose expression is liver-specific exhibited decreased expression in amino acid-limited cells suggests a common mode of regulation of these genes by amino acid availability. The strong induction by amino acid limitation of the C/EBP inhibitor gadd153 is of interest in this regard, as increased levels of gadd153 could interfere with C/EBP, which is required for high expression of most liver-specific genes. To investigate further the molecular mechanism for the decrease in albumin mRNA abundance, albumin nuclear transcript levels were quantified in control and tryptophan-limited cells. Tryptophan limitation caused a decrease in albumin nuclear transcript abundance, and this decrease preceded the decrease in albumin mRNA, suggesting that the decrease in albumin mRNA was caused at least partly by a decrease in albumin gene transcription. Additional experiments with actinomycin D indicated that albumin mRNA was also destabilized in the tryptophan-limited cells. Thus, the overall results indicate that the decrease in albumin mRNA in the tryptophan-limited cells is caused by a specific decrease in albumin nuclear transcript abundance and destabilization of albumin mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1959097863,"Streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetogenic agent, is thought to damage pancreatic β-cells by activating immune mechanisms and by alkylating DNA. In the present study, we demonstrated that STZ can produce nitric oxide (NO), a bioregulatory and cytotoxic molecule. When STZ was dissolved in a sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and irradiated with a 22 W circular fluorescent light, nitrite and nitrate, stable oxidation products of NO, were produced. The wavelengths of light most responsible for the photo-decomposition were 300-310 nm and 410-420 nm. When a mixture of reduced hemoglobin and STZ was irradiated with UV light (280-320 nm), hemoglobin underwent characteristic NO-dependent spectral changes. STZ relaxed de-endothelialized aortic strips only in the presence of light. STZ/light-dependent relaxation was attenuated by reduced hemoglobin. These results indicated photo-induced NO production from STZ. NO generation depended on the concentration of STZ, the duration of irradiation, and the distance between sample and light source. In acidic conditions, NO production from STZ was spontaneous even in the dark. Light-independent NO generation was augmented by increasing acidity, and markedly diminished in a D2O-based buffer, indicating the involvement of protons in the mechanism of STZ decomposition in acid. These results imply the usefulness of STZ as an NO-generating reagent, and indicate that direct NO-generation may be a mechanism of STZ toxicity in diabetogenesis.—Kwon, N. S., Lee, S. H., Choi, C. S., Kho, T., Lee, H. S. Nitric oxide generation from streptozotocin. FASEB J. 8: 529-533; 1994."
https://openalex.org/W1498136138,"Recently, arachidonoylethanolamide was identified as the endogenous ligand of the delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol receptor. Herein, we demonstrate that the synthesis of arachidonoylethanolamide is catalyzed by a novel CoA- and ATP-independent pathway, which is highly selective for arachidonic acid as the aliphatic constituent, is specific for ethanolamine as the polar moiety and occurs through a mechanism that utilizes a critical sulfhydryl residue. The production of arachidonoylethanolamide was calcium-independent and heat-labile and was selectively catalyzed by brain microsomal and cytosolic proteins among the tissues examined. Four independent lines of evidence demonstrate that the synthesis of arachidonoylethanolamide occurs through an ATP- and CoA-independent process. 1) The depletion of endogenous rabbit brain cytosolic or microsomal CoA and ATP by dialysis, or depletion of ATP by apyrase treatment, did not diminish the production of arachidonoylethanolamide; 2) the addition of exogenous ATP or CoA to cofactor depleted cytosol or microsomes did not stimulate arachidonoylethanolamide production; 3) the synthesis of arachidonoylethanolamide occurred in the absence of detectable arachidonoyl-CoA and did not correlate with either the amount of arachidonoyl-CoA in the incubation medium or the amount of arachidonoyl-CoA incorporated into polar and nonpolar lipids; 4) the addition of a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled arachidonoyl-CoA to incubations containing [3H]arachidonic acid and ethanolamine did not attenuate the production of [3H]arachidonoylethanolamide by rabbit brain cytosolic or microsomal proteins. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel chemical paradigm for the ATP- and CoA-independent conjugation of the carboxylate moiety of arachidonic acid to yield arachidonoylethanolamide, the first member of a new class of biologically active eicosanoid second messengers."
https://openalex.org/W1506918918,"The binding domain of the human C5a receptor consists of two distinct and physically separable subsites. One of these sites binds the C-terminal 8 amino acids of C5a and is as yet undefined, while the second site lies in the N terminus of the receptor and interacts with the core of C5a. Two deletion mutants were prepared to probe the importance of this second site. Removal of residues 2-22 decreased the binding affinity for C5a by 600-fold, while extending the deletion through residue 30 caused a further 75-fold decrease. Thus, the N terminus is responsible for at least 45% of the total energy for the binding of C5a. The five aspartic acids present in the deleted segments appear to be critical residues, as their conversion to alanines accounts for most of the affinity lost in the two truncations. Despite its importance for binding, the N terminus is not necessary for signal transduction, as a C-terminal peptide analog of C5a was able to stimulate G protein activation and to generate a Ca2+ flux through a receptor lacking residues 2-22. However, intact C5a was a very poor activator of this truncated receptor. These results imply that interaction between the N terminus of the receptor and C5a produces a conformational change in C5a that allows it's C terminus to properly interact with and activate the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1563901359,"Rab5 is a Ras-like small GTPase that regulates early events of endocytosis. Previous work indicates that two GTP-binding defective Rab5 mutants (Rab5:S34N and Rab5:N133I) are dominant inhibitors of endocytosis. In this report, we have initiated experiments to address the structural features necessary for the inhibitory activity of these two Rab5 mutants. Second-site mutations were introduced into Rab5:S34N and Rab5:N133I, respectively, and the resulting double mutants were expressed in cultured BHK-21 cells via a Sindbis virus expression vector. Endocytic activity of the cells was monitored by following the uptake of a fluid-phase endocytic marker (horseradish peroxidase). The effects of the Rab5 mutants on endosome fusion in vitro were also examined. Truncation of the C-terminal isoprenylation motif CCSN abolished the inhibitory activity of both Rab5:S34N and Rab5:N133I. The same held true when the secondary mutation was a substitution mutation (F57S) in the effector domain. Another substitution mutation in this region (I53A) had no effect on the inhibitory activity of either Rab5:S34N or Rab5:N133I. The final mutation (R81A) was created immediately downstream of the second GTP binding motif (WDTAGQER), i.e. in the loop 4 region based on the structural model of Ras. This mutation greatly decreased the isoprenylation of Rab5:N133I and its inhibitory activity on endocytosis. It is believed that Rab5 function requires protein-protein interactions with Rab5-specific regulators and effectors. Some of these interactions are disrupted by Rab5:S34N and Rab5:N133I. By analogy to Ras, both Rab5:S34N and Rab5:N133I are likely to sequester a Rab5-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. This interaction requires the effector domain Phe57 residue and C-terminal isoprenylation of Rab5."
https://openalex.org/W1604642620,"We investigated the involvement of calmodulin-dependent cellular processes in the regulation of the human serotonin transporter in placental choriocarcinoma cells. Treatment of JAR and BeWo cells with the selective calmodulin antagonist 1,3-dihydro-1-[1-((4-methyl-4H, 6H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][4,1]-benzoxapin-4-yl)-methyl)-4-piperindinyl+ ++]- 2H-benzimidazol-2-one (CGS93-43B (CGS)) for 1 h decreased the imipramine-sensitive serotonin transport activity markedly. The inhibitory effect was specific and was reproducible with other calmodulin antagonists. The basal serotonin transport activity as well as the activity that was stimulated by cholera toxin were inhibited to a similar extent. The CGS-induced inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the maximal velocity and in the affinities of the transporter for Na+ and Cl- and an increase in the affinity for serotonin. There was, however, no change in the Na+/Cl-/serotonin stoichiometry. The inhibition of the transport activity induced by the treatment of intact cells with CGS was observable in plasma membrane vesicles isolated from these cells. Treatment with CGS had no effect on steady state levels of the serotonin transporter mRNAs nor on the transporter density in the plasma membrane. We conclude that the serotonin transporter is regulated by calmodulin-dependent processes in human placental choriocarcinoma cells involving posttranslational modification, most likely phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, of the transporter protein."
https://openalex.org/W1903041271,"Human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase2 (NQO2) gene, 1336 base pairs (bp) of the 5'-flanking region and 165 bp of the 3'-flanking region, have been sequenced. NQO2 gene is 20 kilobase pairs in length and have seven exons interrupted by six introns as compared to the previously cloned NQO1 gene which contains six exons. 187 bp of the first exon in the NQO2 gene are noncoding and are absent in the NQO1 gene. 92 bp of the second exon in the NQO2 gene corresponded to the first exon of the NQO1 gene and so on. The sizes and nucleotide sequences of exons 3-6 are highly conserved between NQO2 and NQO1 genes. The last exon in the NQO2 gene is 1603 bp shorter than the last exon of the NQO1 gene and encodes for 58 amino acids as compared to 101 amino acids encoded by the NQO1 gene. This makes NQO2 protein 43 amino acids shorter than the NQO1 protein. The high degree of conservation between NQO2 and NQO1 gene organization and sequence confirmed that NQO2 gene encodes for a second member of the NQO gene family in human. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the NQO2 gene revealed presence of four SP1 binding sites at positions -214, -170, -106, and -75, a single copy of the antioxidant response element (ARE) at nucleotide -936, and three copies of xenobiotic response element (XRE) at positions -708, -557, and -51. ARE and XRE elements have previously been found in the promoters of the NQO1 and glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit genes and mediate increases in their expression in response to polycyclic aromatic compounds, phenolic antioxidants, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), respectively. The NQO2 cDNA-derived protein in monkey kidney COS1 cells efficiently catalyzed nitroreduction of anti-tumor compound CB10-200, an analog of nitrophenylaziridine. Northern blot analysis indicates that NQO2 gene is expressed in human heart, brain, lung, liver, and skeletal muscle but does not express in placenta. In contrast, the NQO1 gene was expressed in all human tissues. Large variations were noticed for expression of the NQO2 and NQO1 genes among various tissues, 1336 bp of the 5'-flanking region of the NQO2 gene containing ARE and XRE was found sufficient to increase expression of the CAT gene in response to beta-naphthoflavone and tCDD in transfected human hepatoblastoma (Hep-G2) cells."
https://openalex.org/W1580930367,"The yeast YAP1 gene encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein that utilizes a basic region-leucine zipper (bZip) DNA-binding domain to recognize its cognate DNA element. A synthetic reporter gene containing a SV40 AP-1 response element (ARE) cloned upstream of a TRP5 promoter-lacZ gene fusion shows yAP-1-dependent transactivation in vivo. Recent work has shown that changes in the gene dosage of this factor can dramatically alter the ability of a cell to tolerate a host of toxic agents including cadmium, cycloheximide, and sulfometuron methyl. We have focused on the YAP1-dependent cadmium resistance as cells that lack a functional YAP1 gene are hypersensitive to this metal. Deletion mapping experiments define two domains in the carboxyl-terminal region of the yAP-1 protein that are required for normal cadmium tolerance and ARE-TRP5-lacZ expression. Single amino acid substitutions in the bZip domain of yAP-1 indicate that this region is required for normal DNA binding and in vivo function of the protein. Replacement of a non-canonical asparagine with leucine in the yAP-1 leucine zipper leads to production of a defective protein. A substitution mutation in the basic domain converts this mutant protein into a dominant negative factor. The ability of yAP-1 to act as a positive regulator of transcription is required for its biological action."

Freshly isolated proximal tubular cells from rat kidney were exposed to the nephrotoxin 1,2-dichlorovinyl-L-cysteine (DCVC). DCVC stimulated the formation of hydroperoxides as determined by flow cytometry using the hydroperoxide-sensitive compound dichlorofluorescein. This was prevented by the antioxidant diphenylphenylenediamine (DPPD) and the iron chelator desferrioxamine. Studies in individual cells with video-intensified fluorescence microscopy showed that a DCVC-induced increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was accompanied by an increase in the mitochondrial free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]m). The latter increase was selectively prevented by an inhibitor of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, ruthenium red (RR). Chelation of cellular Ca2+ with EGTA acetoxymethyl ester (EGTA/AM) completely prevented the formation of hydroperoxides, whereas inhibition of the uptake of Ca2+ by the mitochondria with RR reduced it. This indicates that the increase in [Ca2+]m is important for the induction of oxidative stress by DCVC. DPPD and desferrioxamine did not protect against a DCVC-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]m, indicating that oxidative stress is the consequence rather than the cause of the cellular calcium perturbations. DCVC decreased delta psi and caused cell death; both effects were clearly delayed by EGTA/AM and RR, although they could not prevent a decrease in delta psi. The latter decrease was completely prevented by inhibition of the beta-lyase-mediated metabolism of DCVC with aminooxyacetic acid. Like EGTA/AM, inhibition of oxidative stress with DPPD and desferrioxamine delayed the decrease in delta psi. This strongly suggests that the decrease in delta psi caused by metabolites of DCVC directly is potentiated by Ca(2+)-dependent DCVC-induced hydroperoxide formation. The importance of both hydroperoxide formation and mitochondrial damage in DCVC-induced cell killing is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2004601824,"Spm is epigenetically inactivated by C-methylation near its transcription start site. We have investigated the interaction between TnpA, an autoregulatory protein that can reactivate a silent Spm, and the promoter of the element. The promoter undergoes rapid de novo methylation and inactivation in stably transformed plants, but only if it includes a GC-rich sequence downstream of the promoter. TnpA activates the inactive, methylated promoter and leads to reduced methylation. By contrast, TnpA represses the active, unmethylated Spm promoter. Only the internal DNA-binding and dimerization domains of the protein are required for repression, while activation requires an additional C-terminal sequence. TnpA is therefore a unique regulatory protein with a conventional transcriptional repressor activity and a novel ability to activate a methylated, inactive promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1515769111,"Hepatic cytochrome P450 cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, CYP7, is regulated in vivo at the protein and the mRNA level in response to multiple physiological factors, including liver cholesterol synthesis, bile acid feedback inhibition, and diurnal rhythm. In the present study we investigated whether the liver transcription factor DBP (albumin promoter D-site binding protein), which undergoes a striking diurnal rhythm in rat liver (DBP levels during evening/morning approximately 100:1), contributes to the diurnal regulation of CYP7 gene expression. DNase I footprinting analysis using bacterially expressed DBP and a cloned 5'-flanking DNA segment of the rat CYP7 gene revealed five distinct DBP-binding sites, designated A-E, distributed between nucleotides (nts) -41 and -295 relative to the CYP7 transcription start site. CYP7-directed gene transcription in HepG2 cells transfected with a 5'-CYP7 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase reporter was activated up to 12-fold upon cotransfection of a DBP expression vector, whereas an HNF-1 alpha expression vector did not stimulate CYP7 gene activity. 5'-Deletion analyses and site-specific mutagenesis revealed that this stimulating effect of DBP can in part be ascribed to its functional interaction with DBP binding sites B (nts -115/-125), C (nts -172/-195), and D (nts -214/-230). C/EBP beta (LAP), another liver-enriched basic-leucine zipper transcription factor, bound to these same sites but effected a more modest increase in CYP7-directed gene transcription (up to 3-4-fold) when expressed in HepG2 cells. Competition for CYP7 promoter-binding sites between C/EBP, which undergoes < or = 2-fold diurnal change in rat liver, and the diurnally regulated DBP is proposed to determine the relative rates of basal versus diurnally regulated CYP7 gene transcription and thus may be a primary mechanism for setting the 3-6-fold amplitude that characterizes the circadian rhythm of liver CYP7 expression. Moreover, since DBP is first expressed in rat liver 3-4 weeks after birth, these findings may account for both the enhanced expression and the onset of the diurnal pattern of CYP7 enzyme levels at this stage of development."
https://openalex.org/W1970064918,"In spite of the large amount of sequence conservation among the DNA binding segments of basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins, these proteins can discriminate differently between target sequences that differ in half-site spacing. Here it is shown that the half-site spacing preferences of bZIP proteins are the result of (i) the differential intrinsic curvature in target binding sites that differ by insertion or deletion of a single base pair and (ii) the ability of some bZIP proteins to overcome this intrinsic curvature through a mechanism dependent on basic segment residues."
https://openalex.org/W1563142811,"Translation initiation factor eIF-4B promotes the binding of mRNA to 40 S preinitiation complexes and together with eIF-4A possesses RNA helicase activity. To elucidate structural features involved in its function, a series of internal and C-terminal deletions, as well as point mutations, were constructed in the eIF-4B cDNA. The mutated cDNAs were expressed in transiently transfected COS-1 cells, and mutant forms of the factor were overproduced up to about 25-fold over endogenous eIF-4B levels. Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) synthesis by high levels of eIF-4B variants was determined in vivo, and the binding of the eIF-4B forms to biotinylated RNA was measured in vitro. The results indicate that the N-terminal region containing the RNA binding motif with its RNP1 and RNP2 consensus elements is sufficient for inhibition of DHFR synthesis. Deletion of the RNP1 sequence abrogates RNA binding, but amino acid substitutions at conserved residues do not always inhibit RNA binding. Deletion of the DRYG domain near the middle of eIF-4B results in inhibition of RNA binding, but not of DHFR synthesis. Up to 164 residues of the C terminus are not required for RNA binding, but removal of 226 or more residues completely inhibits RNA binding, perhaps by the loss of two arginine-rich regions. The results suggest that both the RNA recognition motif and the arginine-rich region are required for stable RNA binding but that both are not necessary for in vivo inhibition of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1582208001,"Nerve cells are particularly sensitive to thiamine deficiency. We studied thiamine transport in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro 2a) cells. At low external concentration, [14C]thiamine was taken up through a saturable high affinity mechanism (Km = 35 nM). This was blocked by low concentrations of the Na+ channel activators veratridine (IC50 = 7 +/- 4 microM) and batrachotoxin (IC50 = 0.9 microM). These effects were not antagonized by tetrodotoxin and were also observed in cell lines devoid of Na+ channels, suggesting that these channels are not involved in the mechanism of inhibition. At high extracellular concentrations, thiamine uptake proceeds essentially via a low affinity carrier (Km = 0.8 mM), insensitive to veratridine but blocked by divalent cations. In both cases, the uptake was independent on external sodium, partially inhibited (10-35%) by depolarization and sensitive to metabolic inhibitors. A linear relationship between the rate of thiamine transport and intracellular ATP concentration was found. When cells grown in a medium of low thiamine concentration (6 nM) were exposed to 100 nM extracellular thiamine, a 3-fold increase in intracellular thiamine diphosphate was observed after 2 h while the concomitant increase in intracellular free thiamine was barely significant. These data suggest a secondary active transport of thiamine, the main driving force being thiamine phosphorylation rather than the sodium gradient."
https://openalex.org/W1482774511,"Binding of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) triggers a series of intracellular events culminating in lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation. A novel transient assay of signal transduction leading to proliferation is now described which allows the rapid functional assessment of wild type and mutant receptors, including the IL-2R and other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. This assay has been used to define domains and specific residues within the IL-2R beta intracellular region that contribute to growth signal transduction. In these studies, internal deletion of either the conserved or proximal cytokine receptor homology segments significantly impaired receptor function. Similarly, mutation of specific key residues within or between Box 1 and Box 2, or deletion of the C-terminal 94 residues of the IL-2R beta chain, impaired growth signaling. In contrast, either replacement of the transmembrane domain with that of the CD4 molecule or internal deletion of the 119 amino acids immediately downstream of Box 2 had no impact on growth signaling competence. These studies thus further define the functional architecture of the intracellular region of IL-2R beta, and reveal specific receptor domains that are dispensable, unique, or functionally redundant."
https://openalex.org/W1527362537,"The activity of the yeast transcription activator HAP1 is controlled by heme. Previously, it has been shown that a heme-responsive domain containing multiple repeats of a conserved motif blocks DNA binding in the absence of heme. In this report, we show that HAP1 is sequestered in a high molecular weight complex in the absence of heme. Titration of the high molecular weight complex by addition of a non-DNA-binding form of HAP1 allows the protein to form dimeric complexes in the absence of heme in vitro and acquires partial transcriptional activity in vivo. The results indicate that one or more cellular factor(s) complexes with HAP1 and represses its activity in the absence of heme. Deletion of the heme domain prevents sequestration of HAP1 in the high molecular weight complex. We discuss these findings in a model that postulates that the heme domain of HAP1 can interact with other cellular factors to regulate HAP1."
https://openalex.org/W1513011754,"The human cytomegalovirus UL80 gene encodes an 80-kDa precursor polyprotein whose N-terminal 256-amino acid domain is a protease. This enzyme cleaves a specific peptide bond that results in its own release from the precursor, as well as a peptide bond near the C terminus of the viral assembly protein. The latter cleavage is apparently required for encapsidation of the viral genomic DNA and maturation of the viral capsid. A series of peptide substrates, representing the assembly protein cleavage site, was used to study the enzyme's substrate requirements and specificity. It was found that efficient cleavage minimally required the amino acid residues spanning the P4 to P4' positions. Substitution at any of these residues adversely affected the reaction. Conservation of the hydrophobic residues at P3 and P4 was essential. In addition, cleavage of a peptide representing the protease domain release site was reduced almost 100-fold relative to cleavage of the assembly protein maturation site peptide substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1633048382,"The antigenic determinants of the blood group P family (P1, P, Pk, and LKE antigens) are chemically based on Gal alpha 4Gal. For human erythrocytes it has been claimed that the majority of P1 determinants are expressed in glycoproteins, mainly band 4.5 (Haselberger, C. G., and Schenkel-Brunner, H. (1982) FEBS Lett. 149, 126-128). In the present work, the existence of Gal alpha 4Gal in glycoproteins of erythrocyte membranes (ghosts) of P1 positive and negative human individuals was carefully analyzed on replicas of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels using specific reagents (Escherichia coli HB101/pDC1 expressing the Pap gene and monoclonal antibodies with specificities for P1 and Pk antigens). No binding to glycoproteins was detected with any of these ligands when the ghosts had been pretreated with butanol to remove glycolipids. Therefore, all antigenic determinants of the P blood group family on human red cells are exclusively expressed in glycolipids and are absent from glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1900531575,"The amiloride binding protein (ABP) is detected in many epithelium-rich and/or hematopoietic tissues (Lingueglia, E., Renard, S., Voilley, N., Waldmann, R., Chassande, O., Lazdunski, M., and Barbry, P. (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 216, 679-687). The protein binds amiloride and some of its derivatives, such as phenamil, benzamil, and ethylpropylamiloride. These properties have previously suggested that ABP might be associated with an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel. It corresponds in fact to an amiloride-sensitive diamine oxidase (DAO) that catalyzes the degradation of compounds such as putrescine or histamine. The analysis of the organization of the sequence of the human ABP/DAO gene reveals that the 2.4-kilobase messenger RNA is transcribed from two close origins identifying the proximal promoter. After sequencing, some corrections within the initial cDNA sequence have been made. Human ABP/DAO corresponds to a 751-residue polypeptide. The promoter activity of 1800 base pairs upstream of the transcription start sites of the long form has been analyzed. Two bulks of cis-activating sequences have been identified. One of them constitutes the proximal promoter. It contains a palindromic sequence previously described as E-PAL. This motif is essential for the full activity of the promoter and behaves like a composite element. This first molecular cloning of a human gene coding for a diamine oxidase will allow us to further understand its regulation during cell growth and/or embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1553941378,"3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) is one of the primary chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Unfortunately, AZT therapy is accompanied by severe side effects. Using Golgi-enriched membrane fractions, we have determined that 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine monophosphate, the primary AZT metabolite in treated cells, potently inhibits protein glycosylation. This inhibition results from direct competition with several pyrimidine-sugars for transport into Golgi membranes. This potential mechanism of cytotoxicity does not involve 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate, the AZT metabolite most likely responsible for its antiviral effects; thus, it may be possible to develop novel therapeutic strategies that prevent inhibition of glycosylation without affecting the anti-HIV properties of AZT."
https://openalex.org/W1668468287,"Heparin is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, synthesized by connective tissue-type mast cells. Rat mast cell protease 1 (RMCP-1), a chymotrypsin-like serine protease expressed specifically by connective tissue-type mast cells, is recovered in a macromolecular complex with heparin proteoglycan. The heparin.RMCP-1 complexes are stored in the secretory granules of the cells and are released following mast cell activation. We showed previously that dissociation of RMCP-1 from heparin resulted in loss of protease activity, as measured by its ability to inactivate thrombin. In the present report the binding of heparin to RMCP-1 was characterized. Affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose showed that RMCP-1 displayed high affinity for heparin, with approximately 1.2 M NaCl being required for elution of RMCP-1 from the affinity matrix. The structural requirements for the binding of heparin to RMCP-1 were investigated. Heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate, three glycosaminoglycans structurally related to heparin, were > or = 80-fold less effective in binding to RMCP-1 than heparin. The 2-O-sulfate, 6-O-sulfate, and N-sulfate groups in heparin were all shown to contribute in the binding. The minimal heparin sequence required for binding to RMCP-1 was found in a 14-saccharide fraction. 14-Saccharide species, obtained after separation by anion exchange chromatography, showed continuously increased binding with increasing anionic charge densities. The 16-18-saccharides were the smallest heparin oligosaccharides capable of accelerating the inactivation of thrombin by RMCP-1."
https://openalex.org/W1562150474,"The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor is composed of an alpha subunit which binds GM-CSF and a beta subunit, which together form the high affinity receptor. By transfecting the human alpha subunit into murine Ba/F3 cells, we have been able to investigate the role of the short 54-amino acid intracytoplasmic portion (amino acid 346-400) of this subunit in mediating cell growth. We have shown that the intracytoplasmic amino acids 346-382 are necessary for GM-CSF-mediated cell growth. In contrast, amino acids 382-400 can be removed without effect. The stable transfection of the human beta subunit into the cell lines containing the mutant alpha subunits did not affect the growth characteristics of these cells. The ability of GM-CSF to stimulate cell growth of the Ba/F3 cells alpha subunit transfectants was correlated with the ability of this hormone to translocate protein kinase C to the particulate fraction. In contrast, the ability of GM-CSF addition to increase phosphorylation of the human beta subunit did not correlate with cell growth and required the entire intracytoplasmic domain of the alpha subunit. These results demonstrate an important role for the intracytoplasmic portion of the alpha subunit in mediating both signal transduction and cell cycle commitment stimulated by GM-CSF."
https://openalex.org/W1579946096,"Fusion of influenza virus with cells is triggered by a pH-dependent conformational change in the viral envelope protein, hemagglutinin, which results in exposure of the fusion peptide and its insertion into the target membrane. We have investigated the association of hemagglutinin with erythrocyte membranes by photosensitized labeling with [125I]iodonaphthylazide. This technique relies on the collisional energy transfer from a photosensitizing chromophore to [125I]iodonaphthylazide, which selectively labels proteins in the vicinity of the chromophore. Incubation of influenza virus with erythrocyte membranes containing chromophore and [125I]iodonaphthylazide results in labeling of hemagglutinin under fusogenic conditions (pH 5 and 37 degrees C). We also examined photosensitized labeling of hemagglutinin upon incubation of the X31 strain of influenza virus with labeled erythrocyte membranes in a pre-fusion state (pH 5 and 4 degrees C). There was little hemagglutinin labeling under these conditions, although incubation of bromelain-cleaved hemagglutinin, which lacks the transmembrane region, resulted in rapid labeling. Hemagglutinin was also labeled by [125I]iodonaphthylazide photosensitized by a fluorescent substrate transported through the erythrocyte band 3 sialoglycoprotein. Hemagglutinin labeling decreased after an initial rapid rise, suggesting that the fusion site is close to the sialoglycoprotein and that [125I]iodonaphthylazide photosensitized labeling may be used to assay protein movement during fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1481539382,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc33ts4-2 mutant produces a temperature-sensitive allele of the cap-binding subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-4F (also termed eIF-4E). From a Drosophila cDNA library constructed in a multicopy yeast shuttle vector, a clone was isolated which restored the ability to grow at elevated temperature to cdc33ts4-2 cells. The rescuing Drosophila clone encodes a small ribosomal subunit protein, which we name S15a based on its molecular weight and similarity with the Brassica napus S15a ribosomal protein. Transcription of the Drosophila gene, RpS15a, occurs at all developmental stages and is enhanced during oogenesis. The ribosomal protein gene is capable of suppressing other alleles of cdc33 but not an inactivation mutation, suggesting that suppression is dependent upon the presence of the temperature-sensitive eIF-4E protein. Supporting this, Western blot analysis shows that far more eIF-4E protein is present in cdc33 yeast cells expressing the RpS15a gene than lacking it. Levels of other unrelated proteins are unaffected. We propose therefore that the expression of high levels of the Drosophila S15a ribosomal protein in the cdc33 yeast cells leads to a selective stabilization of the temperature-sensitive eIF-4E protein, which accounts for the suppression phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1529038925,"The minimal promoter/transcription factor requirements for induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) transcription by cAMP-activated protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibition of this induction by insulin were investigated. H4 hepatoma cells were treated with or without insulin following cotransfection with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes and expression vectors coding for the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation domain fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (CRG) and the catalytic subunit of PKA. Mutation of the PEPCK CRE to a GAL4 binding site (G4-PEPCK) within the fully responsive PEPCK promoter (-600/+69) made induction by PKA dependent upon cotransfection of CRG and this induction by CRG+PKA was inhibited by insulin. Mutation of the insulin regulatory sequence (delta IRS-G4-PEPCK) did not prevent induction by cAMP or inhibition by insulin. Fusion of GAL4 binding sites to the PEPCK TATA region (-40/+1, G4-PT) allowed induction by CRG+PKA and inhibition by insulin. However, inhibition by insulin was not observed when the CREB activation domain in CRG was replaced with the activation domain of VP16 (G4-VP16) or when the PEPCK TATA region was replaced with TATA regions from other genes. Our results indicate that the minimal requirements for induction of PEPCK by PKA and inhibition by insulin include: 1) the CREB activation domain, 2) the PEPCK TATA sequence, and 3) insulin-responsive hepatoma cells. These data suggest that specific factors interacting with both the PEPCK TATA region and the CREB activation domain are required for insulin inhibition of PKA-induced transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1599886979,"The temporal relationship of glucose-induced increases in cytoplasmic pH (pHi) and cytoplasmic free Ca2+ was studied in single mouse pancreatic beta-cells and suspensions of clonal beta-cells (HIT). In both preparations of cells the increase in pHi preceded the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ increase. Therefore the alkalinization cannot be a consequence of the Ca2+ influx. A potential metabolic mechanism for the increase in pHi, involving stimulation of pyruvate transport and oxidation, was demonstrated in a model system of liver mitochondria incubated with pyruvate, ATP, and hexokinase to which glucose was then added to initiate ATP use. The involvement of this mechanism in beta-cells is suggested by the observation that the alkalinization was prevented in most cells by incubation with 3-hydroxycyanocinnamate, a mitochondrial pyruvate transport inhibitor. On the other hand, the inhibited cells exhibited normal Ca2+ responses to glucose stimulation. This indicates that neither pyruvate metabolism nor the alkalinization is of critical importance for the Ca2+ signal, though pyruvate oxidation or its metabolites may be important in downstream regulation of secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1592522169,"The phosphorylation of lysosomal enzymes on high mannose residues is the first step in the targeting of these enzymes to lysosomes in a wide range of mammalian cells. Phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes bind to mannose 6-phosphate receptors, which divert them from the secretory pathway and direct them toward the lysosome. We have been investigating the basis for the specific recognition of lysosomal enzymes by UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase by using the precursor form of the lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin L, as a model lysosomal enzyme in an in vitro assay for mannose phosphorylation. Cathepsin L was found to be phosphorylated in vitro with the same efficiency as other lysosomal enzymes and to contain a conformationally sensitive protein signal that is recognized by phosphotransferase. Biochemical modification of lysine residues on cathepsin L with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide acetate prevented the enzyme from being phosphorylated, indicating that lysine is an important component of the signal. The modification itself did not cause any major conformational changes in cathepsin L. When the same modification was performed on a number of other lysosomal enzymes, phosphorylation was also inhibited. Thus, we conclude that lysine residues are important features of lysosomal enzyme phosphotransferase recognition sites in general, and we discuss the implications of this finding in the ongoing efforts to define the phosphotransferase recognition site."
https://openalex.org/W1588117493,"Following light absorption, at neutral pH the bacteriorhodopsin mutant Y57N does not show Schiff base deprotonation (no M intermediate) or proton pumping activity. We reasoned that this might be due to improper delta pKa between the proton-donating Schiff base and the proton-accepting Asp-85 after light absorption. To test this, we reduced the intrinsic pKa of the protonated Schiff base in the pigment (and thus in the photointermediates) by replacing the retinal chromophore with an analogue, 14-F retinal. This substitution restores light-induced M formation, strongly suggesting that light-induced Schiff base deprotonation is accomplished by lowering its pKa during the photochemical cycle. Thus, while it is generally accepted that the Schiff base deprotonation during the photocycle takes place because of the light-induced reduction in its pKa, we provide here the first experimental evidence of this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1529701213,"Glutathione transferase P1-1, normally very low in adult rat liver, is induced by a single intravenous dose of lead nitrate. In this transient induction, there are at least three sites of regulation or control. These are transcription, post-transcription, and post-translation. The increase in transcription is evident both by nuclear run-off analysis and by measurement of mRNA levels. The other two sites of control were seen in actinomycin D-treated animals in which RNA synthesis was inhibited by over 80%. Treatment with actinomycin D increases the stability of the mRNA and also somehow inhibits the conversion of a glutathione transferase protein to an enzymatically active form. These three sites offer possibilities for the study of mechanisms of control for this interesting enzyme that may play a role in chemical carcinogenesis and in drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1608735914,"The ligand-binding chain of the interferon-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma R) is a unique cell surface protein which has no similarities to other cytokine receptors. Expression of this receptor chain (alpha-subunit) is not sufficient to mediate responsiveness to IFN-gamma. We and others have shown that IFN-gamma-mediated signal transduction requires a species-specific interaction of the extracellular portion of the known IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain with an additional receptor subunit that was cloned recently and designated IFN-gamma R beta-chain or accessory factor 1. Here, we investigated whether this tight species barrier also applies to signaling events mediated by the cytoplasmic receptor domain. A cell line derived from embryos that lack the IFN-gamma R alpha-subunit was reconstituted with a hybrid mouse-human alpha-subunit that consisted of an extracellular murine and transmembrane and cytoplasmic human domains. The experiments reported herein showed that in mouse cells, the human intracellular domain of the hybrid IFN-gamma R alpha-subunit was fully functional and that, therefore, signaling steps involving this domain are not species-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1578116172,"Sonicated unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles induce hemoglobin oxidation in erythrocytes and resealed membrane fragments (buds) at pH 5.5. No such oxidation was observed in vesicle-bud mixtures at pH 7.4, in cells or buds suspended in pH 5.5 buffer, or in cells incubated with multilamellar lipid vesicles at pH 5.5. In buds, vesicle-induced hemoglobin oxidation was accompanied by lipid peroxidation and formation of covalent high molecular weight protein aggregates. The causative relationships among the oxidative events were examined using selective antioxidants and membrane fragments in which the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was cleaved. Protein cross-linking and lipid peroxidation were found to be independent events, but both were found only in concert with heme oxidation. Further, vesicle-induced hemoglobin oxidation was found to be correlated with quasi-stable adsorption of intact vesicles to cells; intercalation of foreign lipid into the cell bilayer was not required. The inability of multilamellar vesicles to induce these low pH oxidative effects suggests a steric limitation on this cell-vesicle association. The results suggest that membrane component reorganization and patching induced by low pH may enhance vesicle adsorption, which in turn initiates oxidative damage."
