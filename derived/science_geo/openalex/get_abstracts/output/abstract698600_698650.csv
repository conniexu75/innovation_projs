https://openalex.org/W4291001314,"Collaborative modelling of the Internet of Things (IoT) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has merged into the Intelligence of Things concept. This recent trend enables sensors to track required parameters and store accumulated data in cloud storage, which can be further utilized by AI based predictive models for automatic decision making. In a smart and sustainable environment, effective waste management is a concern. Poor regulation of waste in surrounding areas leads to rapid spread of contagious disease risks. Traditional waste object management requires more working staff, increases effort, consumes time and is relatively ineffective. In this research, an Intelligence of Things Enabled Smart Waste Management (IoT-SWM) model with predictive capabilities is developed. Here, local sinks (LS) are deployed in specified locations. At every instant, the current status of smart bins in each LS is notified to users to determine the priority level of LS to be emptied. Based on aggregated sensor values for the three smart bins, LS weight and poison gas value, the priority order of emptying LS is computed, and decision is made whether to notify the users with an alert message or not. It also helps in predicting the LS, which is likely to be filled up at a faster rate based on assigned timestamp. This model is implemented in real time with many LS and it was observed that bins, which were close to more crowded sites filled up faster compared to sparse populated areas. Random forest algorithm was used to predict whether an alert notification is to be sent or not. An average mean of 95.8% accuracy was noted while using 60 decision trees in random forest algorithm. The average mean execution latency recorded for training and testing sets is 13.06 sec and 14.39 sec respectively. Observed accuracy rate, precision, recall and f1-score parameters were 95.8%, 96.5%, 98.5% and 97.2% respectively. Model buildup and the validation time computed were 3.26 sec and 4.25 sec respectively. It is also noted that at a threshold value of 0.93 in LS level, the maximum accuracy rate reached was 95.8%. Thus, based on the prediction of random forest approach, a decision to notify the users is taken. Obtained outcome indicates that the waste level can be efficiently determined, and the overflow of dustbins can be easily checked in time."
https://openalex.org/W4291019641,"The research on crop genetic enhancement has created a continuous flow of new, improved germplasm for the benefit of farmers and consumers of the Global South during and after the Green Revolution. Understanding farmers' heterogeneous preferences for varietal traits in different market segments and incorporating the prominent ones in crop breeding programs are expected to facilitate a faster diffusion of these new varieties. Albeit knowing little about farmers' trait preferences in South Asia, public-sector breeding programs prioritize yield enhancement and risk reduction over other varietal traits. Against this backdrop, we examined wheat farmers' preferences for varietal traits in Central India, where the prevailing varietal turnover rate has been meager. We conducted a ranking exercise among 120 individuals, followed by a sex-disaggregated survey with a choice experiment among 420 farm-households in 2019. The lowest varietal turnover rate was observed for the socially marginalized castes. Most women respondents were not actively involved in making decisions related to wheat cultivation, including varietal selection. However, the results indicate that marginalized caste and women farmers are open to experimentation with new varieties, as shown by their positive willingness to pay for improved varietal traits. Across the gender and caste groups, grain quality attributes (especially chapati quality) were ranked high, above the yield-enhancing and risk-ameliorating traits. From the observed patterns, one could deduce that developing and disseminating improved varieties with better grain quality and targeting women and marginalized social groups in varietal dissemination programs could enhance farmer adoption of new, improved germplasm and wheat productivity in Central India."
https://openalex.org/W4290973154,"Deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable success in lesion segmentation and classification between benign and malignant tumors in breast ultrasound images. However, existing studies are predominantly focused on devising efficient neural network-based learning structures to tackle specific tasks individually. By contrast, in clinical practice, sonographers perform segmentation and classification as a whole; they investigate the border contours of the tissue while detecting abnormal masses and performing diagnostic analysis. Performing multiple cognitive tasks simultaneously in this manner facilitates exploitation of the commonalities and differences between tasks. Inspired by this unified recognition process, this study proposes a novel learning scheme, called the cross-task guided network (CTG-Net), for efficient ultrasound breast image understanding. CTG-Net integrates the two most significant tasks in computerized breast lesion pattern investigation: lesion segmentation and tumor classification. Further, it enables the learning of efficient feature representations across tasks from ultrasound images and the task-specific discriminative features that can greatly facilitate lesion detection. This is achieved using task-specific attention models to share the prediction results between tasks. Then, following the guidance of task-specific attention soft masks, the joint feature responses are efficiently calibrated through iterative model training. Finally, a simple feature fusion scheme is used to aggregate the attention-guided features for efficient ultrasound pattern analysis. We performed extensive experimental comparisons on multiple ultrasound datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art multi-task learning approaches, the proposed approach can improve the Dice’s coefficient, true-positive rate of segmentation, AUC, and sensitivity of classification by 11%, 17%, 2%, and 6%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed cross-task guided feature learning framework can effectively fuse the complementary information of ultrasound image segmentation and classification tasks to achieve accurate tumor localization. Thus, it can aid sonographers to detect and diagnose breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4291001264,"Background Patient and stakeholders’ involvement in the development of mental health interventions is a central part of the research process as end-user’s input can improve the design of patient-centered interventions. This is particularly important when developing interventions directed towards improving the mental health of children and adolescents. The rising prevalence of mental health disorders in this population requires special attention and the development of interventions that include them as active participants is crucial. Objective Our aim is to explore the perspectives and opinions of adolescents, parents, educators/youth workers, and clinicians regarding the appeal and usability of an existing patient-centered digital intervention (DIALOG+), which aims to improve quality of life. Methods As part of a broader study aiming to adapt and test DIALOG+, we conducted Online Focus Groups (OFGs) with adults and adolescents in two cities in Colombia. The existing DIALOG+ intervention was introduced to participants, followed by a structured discussion regarding the opinions and views of stakeholders. A framework approach was used to identify the main themes followed by content analysis to aid adaptation. Results We conducted 10 OFGs with a total of 45 participants. A positive feature highlighted by all groups was the innovation of including a digital intervention in a traditional medical visit. Additionally, participants considered that the active role that adolescents have when using the intervention empowers them. Barriers identified included concerns from clinicians related to the time required during consultations and confusion with terminology. Furthermore, additional domains that are particularly relevant for the adolescent population were suggested. Conclusions Data obtained suggest that overall, the DIALOG+ intervention and supporting app are seen as innovative and appealing to adolescents as well as adult stakeholders. However, concerns raised about the availability of time to apply the intervention, the app interface and the language and terminology require modification."
https://openalex.org/W4291007863,"Background Currently, more than 30,200,000 COVID-19 cases have been diagnosed in Germany alone. However, data regarding prevalence of COVID-19 in children, both in Germany and internationally, are sparse. We sought to evaluate the number of infected children by measuring IgG antibodies. Methods Oropharyngeal swabs were collected between December 2020 and August 2021 to measure SARS-CoV-2, and capillary blood for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (by rapid test NADAL® and filter paper test Euroimmun® ELISA); venous blood was taken for validation (Roche® ECLIA and recom Line Blot) in 365 German children aged 3–16 years from 30 schools and preschools. We used multiple serological tests because the filter paper test Euroimmun® ELISA performs better in terms of sensitivity and specificity than the rapid test NADAL®. The Roche® ECLIA test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the recomLine Blot test is used to rule out the possibility of infection by seasonal SARS-viruses and to test for specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins (NP, RBD and S1). In addition, one parent each (n = 336), and 4–5 teachers/caregivers (n = 90) per institution were tested for IgG antibodies from capillary blood samples. The total study duration was 4 months per child, including the first follow-up after 2 months and the second after 4 months. Results Of 364 children tested at baseline, 3.6% (n = 13) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using Euroimmun® ELISA. Seven children reported previously testing positive for SARS-CoV-2; each of these was confirmed by the Roche® Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ECLIA (antibody to spike protein 1) test. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies persisted over a 4-month period, but levels decreased significantly (p = 0.004) within this timeframe. The median IgG values were 192.0 BAU/ml [127.2; 288.2], 123.6 BAU/ml [76.6; 187.7] and 89.9 BAU/ml [57.4; 144.2] at baseline, 2 months and 4 months after baseline, respectively. During the study period, no child tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oropharyngeal swab. A total of 4.3% of all parents and 3.7% of teachers/caregivers tested positive for IgG antibodies by Euroimmun® ELISA at baseline. Conclusion We noted a rather low seroprevalence in children despite an under-reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Measurement of IgG antibodies derived from capillary blood appears to be a valid tool to detect asymptomatic infections in children. However, no asymptomatic active infection was detected during the study period of 4 months in the whole cohort. Further data on SARS-CoV-2 infections in children are needed, especially in the group of &lt;5-year-olds, as there is currently no licensed vaccine for this age group in Germany. The Robert Koch Institute’s Standing Commission on Vaccination (STIKO) recommended COVID-19 vaccination for 12–17 and 5–11 year olds in August 2021 and May 2022 respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4291007879,"To study the relationship between county-level COVID-19 outcomes (incidence and mortality) and county-level median household income and status of Medicaid expansion of US counties.Retrospective analysis of 3142 US counties was conducted to study the relationship between County-level median-household-income and COVID-19 incidence and mortality per 100,000 people in US counties, January-20th-2021 through December-6th-2021. County median-household-income was log-transformed and stratified by quartiles. Multilevel-mixed-effects-generalized-linear-modeling adjusted for county socio-demographic and comorbidities and tested for Medicaid-expansion-times-income-quartile interaction on COVID-19 outcomes.There was no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence-rate across counties by income quartiles or by Medicaid expansion status. Conversely, for non-Medicaid-expansion states, counties in the lowest income quartile had a 41% increase in COVID-19 mortality-rate compared to counties in the highest income quartile. Mortality-rate was not related to income in counties from Medicaid-expansion states.Median-household-income was not related to COVID-19 incidence-rate but negatively related to COVID-19 mortality-rate in US counties of states without Medicaid-expansion."
https://openalex.org/W4291008041,"Mapping and valuing of forest recreation is time-consuming and complex, hampering its inclusion in forest management plans and hence the achievement of a fully sustainable forest management. In this study, we explore the potential of crowdsourced social media data in tackling the mapping and valuing of forest recreation demand. To do so, we assess the relationships between crowdsourced social media data, acquired from over 350,000 Flickr geotagged pictures, and demand for forest recreation in British Columbia (BC) forests. We first identify temporal and spatial trends of forest recreation demand, as well as the countries of origin of BC forests visitors. Second, we estimate the average number of annual recreational visits with a linear regression model calibrated with empirically collected secondary data. Lastly, we estimate recreational values by deriving the average consumer surpluses for the visitors of BC forested provincial parks. We find that annually, on average, over 44 million recreational experiences are completed in BC forests, with peaks during the summer months and during the weekends. Moreover, a crowdsourced travel cost approach allowed us to value the recreational ecosystem service in five forested provincial parks ranging from ~2.9 to ~35.0 million CAN$/year. Our findings demonstrate that social media data can be used to characterize, quantify and map the demand for forest recreation (especially in peri-urban forests), representing a useful tool for the inclusion of recreational values in forest management. Finally, we address the limitations of crowdsourced social media data in the study of forest recreation and the future perspectives of this rapidly growing research field."
https://openalex.org/W4291000801,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegeneration. The expression level of Tom40, a crucial mitochondrial membrane protein, is significantly reduced in neurodegenerative disease subjects. Tom40 overexpression studies have shown to protect the neurons against oxidative stress by improving mitochondrial function. Thus, successful delivery of Tom40 protein to the brain could lead to a novel therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. However, delivering protein to the cell may be difficult. Especially the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a big hurdle to clear in order to deliver the protein to the brain. In the current study, we engineered exosomes, which are the extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin, and able to cross BBB as delivery vehicles packing human Tom40. We found Tom40 protein delivery by the exosome successfully protected the cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. This result suggests that exosome-mediated delivery of Tom40 may potentially be useful in restoring mitochondrial functions and alleviating oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4291007887,"The aim of the study was to examine the periodontal status of patients with atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysms. The occurrence of 5 periodontopathogens was evaluated in periodontal pockets and atheromatous plaques together with specimens from pathologically changed vascular walls of aortic aneurysms. The study comprised 39 patients who qualified for vascular surgeries. Patients with periodontitis and concomitant atherosclerosis or aneurysms were enrolled in the study. Periodontal indices were evaluated, and subgingival plaque samples were examined together with atheromatous plaques or specimens from vascular walls to identify, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the following periodontopathogens: Porphyromonas gingivalis , Tanarella forsythia , Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , Prevotella intermedia and Treponema denticola . The majority of patients had chronic severe generalized periodontitis in stages III and IV. Laboratory investigations showed the occurrence of one or more of the five targeted periodontopathogens in 94.6% of the periodontal pockets examined. Of the examined periodontopathogens, only Porphyromonas gingivalis was confirmed in 1 atheromatous plaque sample collected from the wall of an aortic aneurysm. Therefore, the occurrence of this bacterium in these vessels was considered to be occasional in patients with chronic periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W4291007890,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk reduction strategies primarily focus on biomechanical factors related to frontal plane knee motion and loading. Although central nervous system processing has emerged as a contributor to injury risk, brain activity associated with the resultant ACL injury-risk biomechanics is limited. Thus, the purposes of this preliminary study were to determine the relationship between bilateral motor control brain activity and injury risk biomechanics and isolate differences in brain activity for those who demonstrate high versus low ACL injury risk. Thirty-one high school female athletes completed a novel, multi-joint leg press during brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize bilateral motor control brain activity. Athletes also completed an established biomechanical assessment of ACL injury risk biomechanics within a 3D motion analysis laboratory. Knee abduction moments during landing were modelled as a covariate of interest within the fMRI analyses to identify directional relationships with brain activity and an injury-risk group classification analysis, based on established knee abduction moment cut-points. Greater landing knee abduction moments were associated with greater lingual gyrus, intracalcarine cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus activity when performing the bilateral leg press (all z &gt; 3.1, p &lt; .05; multiple comparison corrected). In the follow-up injury-risk classification analysis, those classified as high ACL injury-risk had greater activity in the lingual gyrus, parietal cortex and bilateral primary and secondary motor cortices relative to those classified as low ACL injury-risk (all z &gt; 3.1, p &lt; .05; multiple comparison corrected). In young female athletes, elevated brain activity for bilateral leg motor control in regions that integrate sensory, spatial, and attentional information were related to ACL injury-risk landing biomechanics. These data implicate crossmodal visual and proprioceptive integration brain activity and knee spatial awareness as potential neurotherapeutic targets to optimize ACL injury-risk reduction strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4291020973,"Mycoplasma hyorhinis is an emerging swine pathogen bacterium causing polyserositis and polyarthritis in weaners and finishers. The pathogen is distributed world-wide, generating significant economic losses. No commercially available vaccine is available in Europe. Therefore, besides improving the housing conditions for prevention, antimicrobial therapy of the diseased animals is the only option to control the infection. Our aim was to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ten antimicrobials potentially used against M . hyorhinis infection. The antibiotic susceptibility of 76 M . hyorhinis isolates from Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Poland collected between 2019 and 2021 was determined by broth micro-dilution method and mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA). Low concentrations of tiamulin (MIC 90 0.312 μg/ml), doxycycline (MIC 90 0.078 μg/ml), oxytetracycline (MIC 90 0.25 μg/ml), florfenicol (MIC 90 2 μg/ml) and moderate concentrations of enrofloxacin (MIC 90 1.25 μg/ml) inhibited the growth of the isolates. For the tested macrolides and lincomycin, a bimodal MIC pattern was observed (MIC 90 &gt;64 μg/ml for lincomycin, tulathromycin, tylosin and tilmicosin and 5 μg/ml for tylvalosin). The results of the MAMA assay were in line with the conventional method with three exceptions. Based on our statistical analyses, significant differences in MIC values of tiamulin and doxycycline were observed between certain countries. Our results show various levels of antimicrobial susceptibility among M . hyorhinis isolates to the tested antibiotics. The data underline the importance of susceptibility monitoring on pan-European level and provides essential information for proper antibiotic choice in therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4291021618,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the least studied complication of nephrotic syndrome (NS). Risk factors which predispose children with NS to developing PAD include hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and prolonged use of steroids. The development of PAD significantly increases the morbidity and mortality associated with NS as such children are prone to sudden cardiac death. The ankle brachial index (ABI) is a tool that has been proven to have high specificity and sensitivity in detecting PAD even in asymptomatic individuals. We aimed to determine the prevalence of PAD in children with NS and to identify risk factors that can independently predict its development. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted involving 200 subjects (100 with NS and 100 apparently healthy comparative subjects that were matched for age, sex and socioeconomic class). Systolic blood pressures were measured in all limbs using the pocket Doppler machine (Norton Doppler scan machine). ABI was calculated as a ratio of ankle to arm systolic blood pressure. PAD was defined as ABI less than 0.9. The prevalence of PAD was significantly higher in children with NS than matched comparison group (44.0% vs 6.0%, p &lt; 0.001). Average values of waist and hip circumference were significantly higher in subjects with PAD than those without PAD (61.68± 9.1cm and 67.6± 11.2 cm vs 57.03 ± 8.3cm and 65.60± 12.5cm respectively, p&lt; 0.005). Serum lipids (triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein, total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein) were also significantly higher in subjects with PAD than those without PAD [106.65mg/dl (67.8–136.7) vs 45.72mg/dl (37.7–61.3), 21.33mg/dl (13.6–27.3) vs 9.14mg/dl (7.5–12.3), 164.43mg/dl (136.1–259.6) vs 120.72mg/dl (111.1–142.1) and 93.29mg/dl (63.5–157.3) vs 61.84mg/dl (32.6–83.1), respectively p&lt; 0.05]. Increasing duration since diagnosis of NS, having a steroid resistant NS and increasing cumulative steroid dose were independent predictors of PAD in children with NS; p&lt; 0.05 respectively. With these findings, it is recommended that screening for PAD in children with NS should be done to prevent cardiovascular complications before they arise."
https://openalex.org/W4291001289,"COVID-19 is a viral disease caused by a new strain of corona virus. Currently, prognosis and risk stratification of COVID-19 patients is done by the disease's clinical presentation. Therefore, identifying laboratory biomarkers for disease prognosis and risk stratification of COVID-19 patients is critical for prompt treatment. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the risk stratification and prognostic value of basic coagulation parameters and factors associated with disease severity among COVID-19 patients at the Tibebe Ghion Specialized Hospital, COVID-19 treatment center, Northwest Ethiopia.A follow-up study was conducted among conveniently recruited COVID-19 patients attended from March to June 2021. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire and checklist, respectively. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were analyzed by the HUMACLOT DUE PLUS® machine. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants. Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare the difference between parametric and non-parametric continuous variables, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the value of PT and APTT in the risk stratification and disease prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Ordinal logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with disease severity and prognosis. A P-value < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant for all results.Baseline PT at a cut-off value ≥ 16.25 seconds differentiated severe COVID-19 patients from mild and moderate patients (AUC: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83-0.95). PT also differentiated mild COVID-19 patients from moderate and severe patients at a cut-off value ≤ 15.35 seconds (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84-0.96). Moreover, alcohol drinkers were a 3.52 times more likely chance of having severe disease than non-drinkers (95% CI: 1.41-8.81). A one-year increment in age also increased the odds of disease severity by 6% (95% CI: 3-9%). An increment of ≥ 0.65 seconds from the baseline PT predicted poor prognosis (AUC: 0.93, 0.87-0.99).Prolonged baseline PT was observed in severe COVID-19 patients. Prolonged baseline PT was also predicted to worsen prognosis. An increase from the baseline PT was associated with worsen prognosis. Therefore, PT can be used as a risk stratification and prognostic marker in COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W4291001302,"The low prevalence effect is a phenomenon whereby target prevalence affects performance in visual search (e.g., baggage screening) and comparison (e.g., fingerprint examination) tasks, such that people more often fail to detect infrequent target stimuli. For example, when exposed to higher base-rates of ‘matching’ (i.e., from the same person) than ‘non-matching’ (i.e., from different people) fingerprint pairs, people more often misjudge ‘non-matching’ pairs as ‘matches’–an error that can falsely implicate an innocent person for a crime they did not commit. In this paper, we investigated whether forensic science training may mitigate the low prevalence effect in fingerprint comparison. Forensic science trainees ( n = 111) and untrained novices ( n = 114) judged 100 fingerprint pairs as ‘matches’ or ‘non-matches’ where the matching pair occurrence was either high (90%) or equal (50%). Some participants were also asked to use a novel feature-comparison strategy as a potential attenuation technique for the low prevalence effect. Regardless of strategy, both trainees and novices were susceptible to the effect, such that they more often misjudged non-matching pairs as matches when non-matches were rare. These results support the robust nature of the low prevalence effect in visual comparison and have important applied implications for forensic decision-making in the criminal justice system."
https://openalex.org/W4291001336,"Identifying the alleles that reduce hybrid fitness is a major goal in the study of speciation genetics. It is rare to identify systems in which hybrid incompatibilities with minor phenotypic effects are segregating in genetically diverse populations of the same biological species. Such traits do not themselves cause reproductive isolation but might initiate the process. In the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae , a small percent of F2 generation hybrids between two natural populations suffer from developmental delay, in which adulthood is reached after approximately 33% more time than their wild-type siblings. Prior efforts to identify the genetic basis for this hybrid incompatibility assessed linkage using one or two genetic markers on chromosome III and suggested that delay is caused by a toxin-antidote element. Here, we have genotyped F2 hybrids using multiple chromosome III markers to refine the developmental delay locus. Also, to better define the developmental delay phenotype, we measured the development rate of 66 F2 hybrids and found that delay is not restricted to a particular larval developmental stage. Deviation of the developmental delay frequency from hypothetical expectations for a toxin-antidote element adds support to the assertion that the epistatic interaction is not fully penetrant. Our mapping and refinement of the delay phenotype motivates future efforts to study the genetic architecture of hybrid dysfunction between genetically distinct populations of one species by identifying the underlying loci."
https://openalex.org/W4291001364,"Background Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional (3D) spinal deformity characterized by coronal curvature and rotational deformity. Predicting curve progression is important for the selection and timing of treatment. Although there is a consensus in the literature regarding prognostic factors associated with curve progression, the order of importance, as well as the combination of factors that are most predictive of curve progression is unknown. Objectives (1) create an ordered list of prognostic factors that most contribute to curve progression, and (2) develop and validate a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the final major Cobb angle in AIS patients. Methods 193 AIS patients were selected for the current study. Preoperative PA, lateral and lateral bending radiographs were retrospectively obtained from the Shriners Hospitals for Children. Demographic and radiographic features, previously reported to be associated with curve progression, were collected. Sequential Backward Floating Selection (SBFS) was used to select a subset of the most predictive features. Based on the performance of several machine learning methods, a Random Forest (RF) regressor model was used to provide the importance rank of prognostic features and to predict the final major Cobb angle. Results The seven most predictive prognostic features in the order of importance were initial major Cobb angle, flexibility, initial lumbar lordosis angle, initial thoracic kyphosis angle, age at last visit, number of levels involved, and Risser ""+"" stage at the first visit. The RF model predicted the final major Cobb angle with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.64 degrees. Conclusion A RF model was developed and validated to identify the most important prognostic features for curve progression and predict the final major Cobb angle. It is possible to predict the final major Cobb angle value within 5 degrees error from 2D radiographic features. Such methods could be directly applied to guide intervention timing and optimization for AIS treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4291007889,"Background We examined the determinants of adolescents’ Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and psychological distress (self-reported and parent-reported) during the COVID-19 pandemic, using a random sample of the population of Geneva, Switzerland. Methods Data was drawn from participants aged 14–17 years, who participated with their families to a serosurvey conducted in November and December 2020. Adolescents’ HRQoL was evaluated using the validated adolescent-reported KIDSCREEN-10 and parent-reported KINDL ® scales. Psychological distress was assessed with self-reported sadness and loneliness, and using the KINDL ® emotional well-being scale. Using generalized estimating equations, we examined the role of socio-demographic, family and behavioural characteristics in influencing adolescents’ mental health status and wellbeing. Results Among 240 adolescents, 11% had a low HRQoL, 35% reported sadness and 23% reported loneliness. Based on parents’ perception, 12% of the adolescents had a low HRQoL and 16% a low emotional well-being. Being a girl (aOR = 3.20; 95%CI: 1.67–6.16), increased time on social media (aOR = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.08–3.97), parents’ average to poor mood (aOR = 2.62; 95%CI: 1.10–6.23) and average to poor household financial situation (aOR = 2.31; IC95%: 1.01–6.10) were associated with an increased risk of sadness. Mismatches between adolescents’ and their parents’ perception of HRQoL were more likely for girls ( aOR = 2.88; 95%CI: 1.54–5.41) and in households with lower family well-being (aOR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.86–0.96 ). Conclusions A meaningful proportion of adolescents experienced low well-being during the second wave of COVID-19, and average well-being was lower than pre-pandemic estimates. Adolescents living in underprivileged or distressed families seemed particularly affected . Monitoring is necessary to evaluate the long-term effects of the pandemic on adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4291008066,"Extraction of coal through mountaintop removal mining (MTR) alters many dimensions of the landscape. Explosive blasts, exposed rock, and coal washing have the potential to pollute air and water. Previous research suggests that infants born to mothers living in areas with MTR have a higher prevalence of birth defects. In this cross-sectional study, we further examine the relationship between MTR activity and several types of birth defects. Maternal exposure to MTR was assessed using remote sensing data from Skytruth, which captures MTR activity in the Central Appalachian region of the United States. Active MTR area was quantified within a five-kilometer buffer surrounding geocoded maternal address captured on birth records for live births to Appalachian Kentucky mothers between 1997 and 2003 (N = 95,581). We assigned high, medium, and low exposure based on the tertile of total MTR area within 5-km, and births with no MTR within this buffer were assigned zero exposure. The presence or absence of a birth defect grouped into six major organ systems was identified using birth records alone. Finally, we applied conditional multiple imputation for variables with missing values before conducting separate multivariable log-binomial regression models for each birth defect group. Prevalence ratio (PR) estimates were adjusted for individual level covariates from birth records. The prevalence of gastro-intestinal defects was significantly higher in birth records with high and low active MTR exposure compared to records with no exposure. (High exposure: PR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.14–3.47; low exposure PR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.06–3.31). This study supports some of the existing findings of previous ecological studies. Research addressing the relationship between gastro-intestinal birth defects and MTR coal mining is warranted but should carefully consider temporal dimensions of exposure."
https://openalex.org/W4291020093,"The bubble point pressure (P b ) could be obtained from pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) measurements; nonetheless, these measurements have drawbacks such as time, cost, and difficulties associated with conducting experiments at high-pressure-high-temperature conditions. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made using several approaches (such as regressions and machine learning) to accurately develop models for predicting the P b . However, some previous models did not study the trend analysis to prove the correct relationships between inputs and outputs to show the proper physical behavior. Thus, this study aims to build a robust and more accurate model to predict the P b using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and trend analysis approaches for the first time. More than 700 global datasets have been used to develop and validate the model to robustly and accurately predict the P b . The proposed ANFIS model is compared with 21 existing models using statistical error analysis such as correlation coefficient (R), standard deviation (SD), average absolute percentage relative error (AAPRE), average percentage relative error (APRE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The ANFIS model shows the proper relationships between independent and dependent parameters that indicate the correct physical behavior. The ANFIS model outperformed all 21 models with the highest R of 0.994 and the lowest AAPRE, APRE, SD, and RMSE of 6.38%, -0.99%, 0.074 psi, and 9.73 psi, respectively, as the first rank model. The second rank model has the R, AAPRE, APRE, SD, and RMSE of 0.9724, 9%, -1.58%, 0.095 psi, and 13.04 psi, respectively. It is concluded that the proposed ANFIS model is validated to follow the correct physical behavior with higher accuracy than all studied models."
https://openalex.org/W4291020940,"Pesticides are one of the main drivers of the worldwide amphibian decline. Their actual toxicity depends on a number of factors, like the species in focus or the developmental stage of exposed individuals. As ectothermic species, the metabolism of amphibians is influenced by ambient temperature. Therefore, temperature also affects metabolic rates and thus processes that might enhance or reduce toxic effects. Studies about the interactive effect of temperature and toxicity on amphibians are rare and deliver contrasting results. To investigate the temperature-dependent pesticide sensitivity of larvae of two European species we conducted acute toxicity tests for the viticultural fungicide Folpan® 500 SC with the active ingredient folpet at different temperatures (6°C, 11°C, 16°C, 21°C, 26°C). Sensitivity of Rana temporaria and Bufotes viridis was highly affected by temperature: early larvae (Gosner stage 20) were about twice more sensitive to Folpan® 500 SC at 6°C compared to 21°C. Next to temperature, species and developmental stage of larvae had an effect on sensitivity. The most sensitive individuals (early stages of R . temporaria at 6°C) were 14.5 times more sensitive than the least sensitive ones (early stages of B . viridis at 26°C). Our results raise concerns about typical ecotoxicological studies with amphibians that are often conducted at temperatures between 15°C and 20°C. We suggest that future test designs should be performed at temperatures that reflect the temperature range amphibians are exposed to in their natural habitats. Variations in the sensitivity due to temperature should also be considered as an uncertainty factor in upcoming environmental risk assessments for amphibians."
https://openalex.org/W4291398223,"Background Hypertension (HTN) is highly prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) in Namibia, but screening and treatment for HTN are not routinely offered as part of HIV care delivery. We report the implementation of a quality improvement collaborative (QIC) to accelerate integration of HTN and HIV care within public-sector health facilities in Namibia. Methods Twenty-four facilities participated in the QIC with the aim of increasing HTN screening and treatment among adult PWH (&gt;15 years). HTN was defined according to national treatment guidelines (i.e., systolic blood pressure &gt;140 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 across three measurements and at least two occasions), and decisions regarding initiation of treatment were made by physicians only. Teams from participating hospitals used quality improvement methods, monthly measurement of performance indicators, and small-scale tests of change to implement contextually tailored interventions. Coaching of sites was performed on a monthly basis by clinical officers with expertise in QI and HIV, and sites were convened as part of learning sessions to facilitate diffusion of effective interventions. Results Between March 2017 and March 2018, hypertension screening occurred as part of 183,043 (86%) clinical encounters at participating facilities. Among 1,759 PWH newly diagnosed with HTN, 992 (56%) were initiated on first-line treatment. Rates of treatment initiation were higher in facilities with an on-site physician (61%) compared to those without one (51%). During the QIC, facility teams identified fourteen interventions to improve HTN screening and treatment. Among barriers to implementation, teams pointed to malfunctions of blood pressure machines and stock outs of antihypertensive medications as common challenges. Conclusions Implementation of a QIC provided a structured approach for integrating HTN and HIV services across 24 high-volume facilities in Namibia. As rates of HTN treatment remained low despite ongoing facility-level changes, policy-level interventions—such as task sharing and supply chain strengthening—should be pursued to further improve delivery of HTN care among PWH beyond initial screening."
https://openalex.org/W4290973363,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women have been at high risk for psychological distress. Lifestyle factors may be modifiable elements to help reduce and promote resilience to prenatal stress. We used Machine-Learning (ML) algorithms applied to questionnaire data obtained from an international cohort of 804 pregnant women to determine whether physical activity and diet were resilience factors against prenatal stress, and whether stress levels were in turn predictive of sleep classes. A support vector machine accurately classified perceived stress levels in pregnant women based on physical activity behaviours and dietary behaviours. In turn, we classified hours of sleep based on perceived stress levels. This research adds to a developing consensus concerning physical activity and diet, and the association with prenatal stress and sleep in pregnant women. Predictive modeling using ML approaches may be used as a screening tool and to promote positive health behaviours for pregnant women."

Our objective was to investigate trends in referral patterns to nephrology for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Retrospective cohort study of adults with ≥1 visits to a nephrologist from primary care with ≥1 serum creatinine and/or urine protein measurement <180 days before index nephrology visit, from 2006 and 2019 in Alberta, Canada. Guideline discordant referrals were those that did not meet ≥1 of: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ˂ 30 mL/min/1.73m2, persistent albuminuria (ACR ≥ 300 mg/g, PCR ≥ 500 mg/g, or Udip ≥ 2+), or progressive and persistent decline in eGFR until index nephrology visit (≥ 5 mL/min/1.73m2).Of 69,372 patients with CKD, 28,518 (41%) were referred in a guideline concordant manner. The overall rate of first outpatient visits to nephrology increased from 2006 to 2019, although guideline discordant referrals showed a greater increase (trend 21.9 per million population/year, 95% confidence interval 4.3, 39.4) versus guideline concordant referrals (trend 12.4 per million population/year, 95% confidence interval 5.7, 19.0). The guideline concordant cohort were more likely to be on renin-angiotensin system blockers or beta blockers (hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.12, 1.16), and had a higher risk of CKD progression (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.13), kidney failure (hazard ratio 7.65, 95% confidence interval 6.83, 8.56), cardiovascular event (hazard ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.35,1.45) and mortality (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.52, 1.63).A significant proportion nephrology referrals from primary care were not consistent with current guideline-recommended criteria for referral. Further work is needed to identify quality improvement initiatives aimed at enhancing referral patterns of patients with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W4290993952,"The lacquer tree, Toxicodendron vernicifluum, is a common industrial crop in East Asia. However, T. vernicifluum seeds are extremely difficult to germinate, which poses a major obstacle to establishing seedlings for sap production. In this study, we examined the germination properties of T. vernicifluum seeds in order to establish an inexpensive and effective method to promote seed germination. The seeds are covered with a hard endocarp, which we degrade using conventional sulfuric acid-based methods. Although sulfuric acid was effective in promoting seed germination, the germination rate was less than 5%. In addition to treatment with sulfuric acid, co-treatment with cold temperatures or the phytohormone gibberellic acid increased the germination rate to 22-35%. Seed viability analysis combined with specific gravity-based seed selection revealed that more than half of the seeds housed embryos that were incapable of germination. In additions, specific gravity-based seed selection aided in the selection of seeds capable of germination and improved the germination rate to approximately 47%. Taken together, our results suggest that the low germination rate of T. vernicifluum seeds is due to deep seed dormancy-which is controlled by physical and physiological mechanisms-and low embryo viability. To improve the germination rate of T. vernicifluum seeds, we propose an effective method whereby seeds with good germination capacity are selected based on specific gravity, following which their physiological dormancy is inactivated through cold pretreatment."
https://openalex.org/W4290994018,"Stroke-induced somatosensory impairments seem to be clinically overlooked, despite their prevalence and influence on motor recovery post-stroke. Interest in technology has been gaining traction over the past few decades as a promising method to facilitate stroke rehabilitation. This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study aimed to identify current clinical practice and perspectives on the management of somatosensory impairments post-stroke and the use of technology in assessing outcome measures and providing intervention. Participants were 132 physiotherapists and occupational therapists currently working with stroke patients in public hospitals and rehabilitation centres in Singapore. It was found that the majority (64.4%) of the therapists spent no more than half of the time per week on somatosensory interventions. Functional or task-specific training was the primary form of intervention applied to retrain somatosensory functions in stroke survivors. Standardised assessments (43.2%) were used less frequently than non-standardised assessments (97.7%) in clinical practice, with the sensory subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment being the most popular outcome measure, followed by the Nottingham Sensory Assessment. While the adoption of technology for assessment was relatively scarce, most therapists (87.1%) reported that they have integrated technology into intervention. There was a common agreement that proprioception is an essential component in stroke rehabilitation, and that robotic technology combined with conventional therapy is effective in enhancing stroke rehabilitation, particularly for retraining proprioception. Most therapists identified price, technology usability, and lack of available space as some of the biggest barriers to integrating robotic technology in stroke rehabilitation. Standardised assessments and interventions targeting somatosensory functions should be more clearly delineated in clinical guidelines. Although therapists were positive about technology-based rehabilitation, obstacles that make technology integration challenging ought to be addressed."

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA-Optovue) was used to measure the thickness of the inner-retina (IRT), mid-retina (MRT), and outer-retina (ORT) at foveal (central 1mm), parafoveal (1-3 mm), and perifoveal (3-6 mm) areas, as well as the corresponding VD of the superficial capillary plexus (SVD), deep capillary plexus (DVD), and choricapillaris (CVD).The study enrolled 108 normal eyes from 54 participants with a mean age of 10.9 years. Partial correlations showed that the nasal and inferior parafoveal and perifoveal subsegments IRT, MRT and ORT are more affected by all SVD, DVD, and CVD. Nasal parafoveal and perifoveal MRT and all three capillary layers have a constant negative correlation. ORT was not affected by all three layers except for CVD at fovea. The regression analysis revealed that SVD and CVD were significantly associated with foveal and parafoveal and perifoveal IRT. DVD and gender could significantly affect perifoveal IRT. However, only CVD was significantly affected foveal MRT. Based on regression analysis, only CVD was significantly associated with foveal and parafoveal ORT, but not with perifoveal ORT.The thickness of different retinal layers correlates with retinal and choroidal VD in different ways according to their zones."
https://openalex.org/W4291001102,"Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction, results from dysregulated host responses to infection and still has a high incidence and mortality. Although administration of vasopressors to treat septic shock is standard of care, the benefits are not well established. We evaluated the effect of continuous intravenous norepinephrine infusion in a septic cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model, evaluating systemic hemodynamics and body temperature post-hoc. CLP surgery significantly decreased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, and body temperature within six hours. Continuous norepinephrine infusion (NE+, n = 12) started at the time of CLP surgery significantly increased MAP at 24 and 30 hours and heart rate at 6, 18, 24, and 30 hours after CLP vs CLP alone (NE-, n = 12). However, addition of norepinephrine did not improve survival rate (NE+ n = 34, NE- n = 31). Early (6 hours or earlier, when the animal became visibly sick) MAP did not predict 7-day mortality. However, heart rates at 3 and at 6 hours after CLP/norepinephrine (NE+) were highly predictive of mortality, as also been found in one clinical study. We conclude that limited hemodynamic support can be provided in a mouse sepsis model. We propose that heart rate can be used to stratify severity of illness in rodent preclinical studies of sepsis therapeutics."

Spatially detailed projections of construction and stored carbon are needed for industry and public decision making, including for appreciating trends in values at risk from catastrophic disturbances. We specify econometric models of single-family and multifamily housing starts by U.S. Census Region, design a method for their spatial downscaling to the county level, and project their quantities and carbon content according to the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Starts are projected to decline across all scenarios and potentially drop to below housing replacement levels under SSP3 by mid-century. Wood products carbon stored nationally in structures in use and in landfills is projected to grow across all scenarios but with significant spatial heterogeneity related to disparate trends in construction across counties, ranging from strong growth in the urban counties of the coastal South and West to stagnation in rural counties of the Great Plains and the northern Rockies. The estimated average annual carbon stored in wood products used in and discarded from US residential housing units between 2015–2070 ranged from 51 million t CO 2 e in SSP3 to 85 million t CO 2 e in SSP5, representing 47% to 78% of total carbon uptake relative to uptake by all wood products in the United States in 2019."
https://openalex.org/W4291007905,"The stock market is an important part of the capital market, and the research on the price fluctuation of the stock market has always been a hot topic for scholars. As a dynamic and complex system, the stock market is affected by various factors. However, with the development of information technology, information presents multisource and heterogeneous characteristics, and the transmission speed and mode of information have changed greatly. The explanation and influence of multi-source and heterogeneous information on stock market price fluctuations need further study. In this paper, a graph fusion and embedding method for multi-source heterogeneous information of Chinese stock market is established. Relational dimension information is introduced to realize the effective fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data information. A multi-attention graph neural network based on nodes and semantics is constructed to mine the implied semantics of fusion graph data and capture the influence of multi-source heterogeneous information on stock market price fluctuations. Experiments show that the proposed multi-source heterogeneous information fusion methods is superior to tensor or vector fusion method, and the constructed multi-attention diagram neural network has a better ability to explain stock market price fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W4291008051,"In recent years, 3D in vitro modeling of human skeletal muscle has emerged as a subject of increasing interest, due to its applicability in basic studies or screening platforms. These models strive to recapitulate key features of muscle architecture and function, such as cell alignment, maturation, and contractility in response to different stimuli. To this end, it is required to culture cells in biomimetic hydrogels suspended between two anchors. Currently available protocols are often complex to produce, have a high rate of breakage, or are not adapted to imaging and stimulation. Therefore, we sought to develop a simplified and reliable protocol, which still enabled versatility in the study of muscle function. In our method, we have used human immortalized myoblasts cultured in a hydrogel composed of MatrigelTM and fibrinogen, to create muscle strips suspended between two VELCROTM anchors. The resulting muscle constructs show a differentiated phenotype and contractile activity in response to electrical, chemical and optical stimulation. This activity is analyzed by two alternative methods, namely contraction analysis and calcium analysis with Fluo-4 AM. In all, our protocol provides an optimized version of previously published methods, enabling individual imaging of muscle bundles and straightforward analysis of muscle response with standard image analysis software. This system provides a start-to-finish guide on how to produce, validate, stimulate, and analyze bioengineered muscle. This ensures that the system can be quickly established by researchers with varying degrees of expertise, while maintaining reliability and similarity to native muscle."

However, physicians and lay persons may have differing perceptions of risks and medication efficacy. Both tend to overestimate medication benefits. This study surveyed at what risk physicians would prescribe and lay persons would be willing to take bisphosphonates, the minimum ES both groups do demand and the physicians estimates of the actual benefit of bisphosphonates.Cross-sectional online questionnaire survey.Respondents were confronted with a case vignette with an osteoporotic patient (10-year femoral fracture risk: 32%). They were asked at what threshold of 10-year-risk of femoral neck fracture they would prescribe or take a drug. They were asked for the minimum ES (absolute risk reduction, ARR) they demand from bisphosphonates to prescribe or take them. Physicians were asked to provide their estimate of the actual ARR of bisphosphonates.114 physicians and 140 lay persons answered (convenience sample/snowball distribution). The 10-year-risk threshold of lay persons (Mdnlay = 60%) willing to take medication was twice as high as the physicians' threshold (Mdnphy = 30%) to prescribe it (p < .001). The median minimum ARR physicians demanded for bisphosphonates prescription was 17%, whereas lay persons demanded 22% (p < .001). Physicians estimated the actual ARR of bisphosphonates to be 12%. This estimated effect size was below their own minimum threshold for prescription.Lay persons tolerate a higher fracture risk and demand a larger benefit of antiosteoporotic medication for fracture prevention than physicians. Physicians demand higher minimum benefits than their own estimates which in turn are above the benefit evidence suggests. Physicians should be more familiar with ES of antiosteoporotic drugs concerning patient outcomes and actively advise lay persons before preventive treatment decisions are taken."
https://openalex.org/W4291019534,"Inducing axial vascularisation of tissue engineering constructs is a well-established method to support tissue growth in large 3-dimensional tissues. Progenitor cell chemotaxis towards axially vascularized tissues has not been well characterized. In a prospective randomized controlled study including 32 male syngeneic Lewis rats we investigated the capability of the axially vascularized constructs to attract systemically injected bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs). The underlying mechanism for cell homing was investigated focusing on the role of hypoxia and the SDF1-CXCR4-7 axis. Sixteen animals were used as donors for BMMNCs. The other animals were subjected to implantation of a tissue engineering construct in the subcutaneous groin region. These constructs were axially vascularized either via an arteriovenous loop (AVL, n = 6) or via uninterrupted flow-through vessels (non-AVL, n = 10). BMMNCs were labelled with quantum dots (Qdot® 655) and injected 12 days after surgery either via intra-arterial or intravenous routes. 2 days after cell injection, the animals were sacrificed and examined using fluorescence microscopy. The Qdot® 655 signals were detected exclusively in the liver, spleen, AVL constructs and to a minimal extent in the non-AVL constructs. A significant difference could be detected between the number of labelled cells in the AVL and non-AVL constructs with more cells detected in the AVL constructs specially in central zones (p <0.0001). The immunohistological analysis showed a significant increase in the absolute expression of HIF-1 in the AVL group in comparison to the non-AVL group. The PCR analysis confirmed a 1.4-fold increase in HIF-1 expression in AVL constructs. Although PCR analysis showed an enhanced expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in AVL constructs, no significant differences in SDF1 expression were detected via immunohistological or PCR analysis. At the examined time point, the AVL constructs can attract BMMNCs in a mechanism probably related to the hypoxia associated with a robust tissue formation."
https://openalex.org/W4291019757,"In New Zealand, there are known disparities between the Indigenous Māori and the majority non-Indigenous European populations in access to cancer treatment, with resulting disparities in cancer survival. There is international evidence of ethnic disparities in the distance travelled to access cancer treatment; and as such, the aim of this paper was to examine the distance and time travelled to access surgical care between Māori and European liver and stomach cancer patients. We used national-level data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis to describe the distance travelled by patients to receive their first primary surgery for liver or stomach cancer, as well as the estimated time to travel this distance by road, and the surgical volume of hospitals performing these procedures. All cases of liver (ICD-10-AM 3rd edition code: C22) and stomach (C16) cancer that occurred in New Zealand (2007-2019) were drawn from the New Zealand Cancer Registry (liver cancer: 866 Māori, 2,460 European; stomach cancer: 953 Māori, 3,192 European), and linked to national inpatient hospitalisation records to examine access to surgery. We found that Māori on average travel 120km for liver cancer surgery, compared to around 60km for Europeans, while a substantial minority of both Māori and European liver cancer patients must travel more than 200km for their first primary liver surgery, and this situation appears worse for Māori (36% vs 29%; adj. OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09-2.01). No such disparities were observed for stomach cancer. This contrast between cancers is likely driven by the centralisation of liver cancer surgery relative to stomach cancer. In order to support Māori to access liver cancer care, we recommend that additional support is provided to Māori patients (including prospective financial support), and that efforts are made to remotely provide those clinical services that can be decentralised."

Therefore, the objective of this paper is to determine the possible existence and magnitude of negative psychological aspects within a population of competition sailors and from a probabilistic point of view, using Bayesian Network analysis. Methods The study was carried out on 235 semi-professional sailors of the 49er Class, aged between 16 and 52 years (M = 24.66; SD = 8.03). Results The results show the existence of a Negative Tetrad—formed by achievement burnout, anxiety due to concentration disruption, amotivation and importance given to error—as a probabilistic product of the psychological variables studied: motivation, anxiety, burnout and fear of error. Conclusion These results, supported by Bayesian networks, show holistically the influence of the social context on the psychological and emotional well-being of the athlete during competition at sea."
https://openalex.org/W4290950996,"Language production has often been described as impaired in psychiatric diseases such as in psychosis. Nevertheless, little is known about the characteristics of linguistic difficulties and their relation with other cognitive domains in patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP), either affective or non-affective. To deepen our comprehension of linguistic profile in FEP, 133 patients with FEP (95 non-affective, FEP-NA; 38 affective, FEP-A) and 133 healthy controls (HC) were assessed with a narrative discourse task. Speech samples were systematically analyzed with a well-established multilevel procedure investigating both micro- (lexicon, morphology, syntax) and macro-linguistic (discourse coherence, pragmatics) levels of linguistic processing. Executive functioning and IQ were also evaluated. Both linguistic and neuropsychological measures were secondarily implemented with a machine learning approach in order to explore their predictive accuracy in classifying participants as FEP or HC. Compared to HC, FEP patients showed language production difficulty at both micro- and macro-linguistic levels. As for the former, FEP produced shorter and simpler sentences and fewer words per minute, along with a reduced number of lexical fillers, compared to HC. At the macro-linguistic level, FEP performance was impaired in local coherence, which was paired with a higher percentage of utterances with semantic errors. Linguistic measures were not correlated with any neuropsychological variables. No significant differences emerged between FEP-NA and FEP-A (p≥0.02, after Bonferroni correction). Machine learning analysis showed an accuracy of group prediction of 76.36% using language features only, with semantic variables being the most impactful. Such a percentage was enhanced when paired with clinical and neuropsychological variables. Results confirm the presence of language production deficits already at the first episode of the illness, being such impairment not related to other cognitive domains. The high accuracy obtained by the linguistic set of features in classifying groups support the use of machine learning methods in neuroscience investigations."
https://openalex.org/W4290973024,"In order to improve the molecular resources available for conservation management of Madagascar’s threatened ichthyofauna, we elaborated a curated database of 2860 mitochondrial sequences of the mitochondrial COI , 16S and ND2 genes of Malagasy fishes, of which 1141 sequences of freshwater fishes were newly sequenced for this data set. The data set is mostly composed of COI (2015 sequences) while 16S and ND2 sequences from partly the same samples were used to match the COI sequences to reliably identified reference sequences of these genes. We observed COI uncorrected pairwise genetic distances of 5.2‒31.0% (mean 20.6%) among species belonging to different genera, and 0.0‒22.4% (mean 6.4%) for species belonging to the same genus. Deeply divergent mitochondrial lineages of uncertain attribution were found among Malagasy freshwater eleotrids and gobiids, confirming these groups are in need of taxonomic revision. DNA barcodes assigned to introduced cichlids (tilapias) included Coptodon rendallii , C . zillii , Oreochromis aureus (apparently a new country record), O . cf. mossambicus , O . niloticus , and one undetermined species of Oreochromis , with sequences of up to three species found per location. In aplocheiloid killifishes of the genus Pachypanchax , most species from northern Madagascar had only low mitochondrial divergences, three of these species ( P . omalonotus , P . patriciae , and P . varatraza ) were not reciprocally monophyletic, and one genetically deviant lineage was discovered in a northern locality, suggesting a need for partial taxonomic revision of this genus. While the lack of voucher specimens for most of the samples sequenced herein precludes final conclusions, our first step towards a DNA barcoding reference library of Madagascar’s fishes already demonstrates the value of such a data set for improved taxonomic inventory and conservation management. We strongly suggest further exploration of Madagascar’s aquatic environments, which should include detailed photographic documentation and tissue sampling of large numbers of specimens, and collection of preserved voucher specimens as well as of living fish for the buildup of ex situ assurance populations of threatened species complying with the One Plan Approach proposed by the IUCN SSC Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG)."
https://openalex.org/W4290994026,"Physiological responses to the environment, disease, and aging vary by sex in many animals, but mechanisms of dimorphism have only recently begun to receive careful attention. The genetic model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has well-defined mechanisms of stress response, aging, and sexual differentiation. C . elegans has males, but the vast majority of research only uses hermaphrodites. We found that males of the standard N2 laboratory strain were more resistant to hyperosmolarity, heat, and a natural pro-oxidant than hermaphrodites when in mixed-sex groups. Resistance to heat and pro-oxidant were also male-biased in three genetically and geographically diverse C . elegans strains consistent with a species-wide dimorphism that is not specific to domestication. N2 males were also more resistant to heat and pro-oxidant when keep individually indicating that differences in resistance do not require interactions between worms. We found that males induce canonical stress response genes by similar degrees and in similar tissues as hermaphrodites suggesting the importance of other mechanisms. We find that resistance to heat and pro-oxidant are influenced by the sex differentiation transcription factor TRA-1 suggesting that downstream organ differentiation pathways establish differences in stress resistance. Environmental stress influences survival in natural environments, degenerative disease, and aging. Understanding mechanisms of stress response dimorphism can therefore provide insights into sex-specific population dynamics, disease, and longevity."
https://openalex.org/W4290994105,"Cause marketing (CM) is an important way of implementing corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies. While most related studies explore firms' implementation of CM campaigns, which involve donation of part of their sales revenue to charity for a social cause, we focus on the case of a firm contributing a specific ratio of its sales quantity to implement the CM campaign and divide the CM campaign mix into four modes according to different CM implementation subjects and the wholesale price (exogenous or endogenous). Unlike firms in the supply chain that use donation amounts to implement CM, the implementation of CM by donation ratio will be influenced by the donation cost, which can further affect their pricing strategies. Therefore, this study takes a two-level supply chain as the research object and builds Stackelberg game models to explore the optimization problem of donation and pricing decisions for different CM modes and choices from CM modes. This study presents three main conclusions. First, when the degree of preference for CM is sufficiently large, the supplier or retailer can implement CM only when the income generated by the increase in sales and retail price can compensate for the donation cost. Owing to the differing donation costs, it is easier for suppliers to implement CM than retailers. Second, in the case of the exogenous wholesale price, when the degree of preference for CM is relatively low, the supplier should implement the CM. However, when the degree of preference for CM is relatively high, the retailer should implement the CM. When the degree of preference for CM is moderate, the supplier can suppress the free-rider behavior of the retailer in implementing CM by sharing donation costs with the retailer, thereby achieving a win-win situation. Third, in the case of endogenous wholesale prices, the supplier should take the initiative to implement CM. Compared with other CM modes, the donation ratio is the largest in this mode."

Patients with lymphoma who underwent abdominopelvic CT using dual-source scanner were retrospectively recruited from a single center. CT images were obtained at 90 kVp dual-source mode reformatted in three data sets using the advanced modelled iterative reconstruction algorithm: 100% (standard-dose CT), 66.7% (low-dose CT), and 33.3% (ultralow-dose CT). Two radiologists analyzed subjective image quality and detection of abdominal enlarged lymph nodes on ultralow-dose, low-dose, and standard-dose CT blindly and independently. The results were compared with reference standards. Three readers (two radiologists and one hematologist) reviewed overall image quality and spleen size. In total, 128 consecutive CT scans (77 complete response, 44 partial response, 6 progressive disease, and 1 initial evaluation) from 86 patients (64 B-cell lymphoma, 14 T/NK-cell lymphoma, and 8 Hodgkin's lymphoma cases) were assessed. The enlarged lymph node-based detection rates for two readers were 97.0% (96/99) and 94.0% (93/99) on standard-dose CT, 97.0% (96/99) and 94.0% (93/99) on low-dose CT, and 94.0% (93/99) and 89.9% (89/99) on ultralow-dose CT. Overall image quality was 3.8 ± 0.5, 3.9 ± 0.5, and 4.1 ± 0.5 on ultralow-dose CT; 4.7 ± 0.4, 4.6 ± 0.5, and 4.8 ± 0.3 on low-dose CT; and 4.8 ± 0.4, 4.7 ± 0.4, and 4.9 ± 0.2 on standard-dose CT, according to two radiologists and one hematologist, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients of spleen size were 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-0.93), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.93), and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.93) on ultralow-dose, low-dose, and standard-dose CT, respectively. Mean effective radiation doses of standard-dose, low-dose, and ultralow-dose CT were 5.7 ±1.8 mSv, 3.8 ± 1.2 mSv, and 1.9 ± 0.6 mSv, respectively. Our findings suggest that ultralow-dose and low-dose CT, even with radiation doses reduced by 66.7% and 33.3%, respectively, maintained adequate image quality. These imaging modalities may be employed for follow-up lymphoma evaluation in consideration of the long surveillance periods."

This study examined the extent of adherence to infection prevention practices (IPPs) against COVID-19 in their daily life and its associated factors among staff members in a national medical center designated for COVID-19 treatment in Tokyo, Japan.This cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2020 among 1,228 staff of National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM). We asked participants about their adherence on six IPPs recommended by the WHO in their daily lives, which included wearing masks, maintaining hand and respiratory hygiene, avoiding 3Cs and social distancing. We defined 100% adherence (6 points) to IPPs as good adherence and run logistic regression model to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of IPPs.Nearly 100% of NCGM staff members adhered to four out of six IPPs assessed in this study: washing or sanitizing hands (99.6%), good cough etiquette (99.6%), wearing mask (98.9%), and avoiding 3Cs (98.3%). Doctors (AOR = 2.18, CI: 1.36-3.49) and female staff members (AOR = 1.95, CI: 1.36-3.49) were more likely to adhere to IPPs compared with non-clinical staffs and male counterparts. Good adherence to IPPs tended to increase with older age, with highest adherence among those who were 50 years or above (AOR = 2.53, CI: 1.49-4.29).This study revealed that the IPPs among NCGM staff was remarkably good. Older and female staff members, and doctors showed a higher adhere to IPPs compared with their counterparts. Additional effort to improve adherence to IPPs among the younger and male staff members could contribute to reduce infection risk in their daily life, which can eventually prevent nosocomial infection."
https://openalex.org/W4291008068,"Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a non-contact, rapid, and high-resolution in vivo modality for imaging of the eyeball's anterior segment structures. Because progressive anterior segment deformation is a hallmark of certain eye diseases such as angle-closure glaucoma, identification of AS-OCT structural changes over time is fundamental to their diagnosis and monitoring. Detection of pathologic damage, however, relies on the ability to differentiate it from normal, age-related structural changes.This proposed large-scale, retrospective cross-sectional study will determine whether demographic characteristics including age can be predicted from deep learning analysis of AS-OCT images; it will also assess the importance of specific anterior segment areas of the eyeball to the prediction. We plan to extract, from SUPREME®, a clinical data warehouse (CDW) of Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH; Seoul, South Korea), a list of patients (at least 2,000) who underwent AS-OCT imaging between 2008 and 2020. AS-OCT images as well as demographic characteristics including age, gender, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) will be collected from electronic medical records (EMRs). The dataset of horizontal AS-OCT images will be split into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) datasets, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model will be built to predict demographics. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) will be used to visualize the regions of AS-OCT images that contributed to the model's decisions. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) will be applied to evaluate the model performance.This paper presents a study protocol for prediction of demographic characteristics from AS-OCT images of the eyeball using a deep learning model. The results of this study will aid clinicians in understanding and identifying age-related structural changes and other demographics-based structural differences.Registration ID with open science framework: 10.17605/OSF.IO/FQ46X."
https://openalex.org/W4291019112,"Background/Objective To evaluate the development of intra- and post-operative retinal breaks after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for macular hole (MH) and/or vitreomacular traction (VMT). Subjects/Methods Medical records of patients who underwent PPV at Kellogg Eye Center between 1/1/2005–6/30/2018, were evaluated in three groups: group 1, MH/VMT (n = 136); group 2, epiretinal membrane (ERM) without VMT (n = 270); and group 3, diagnostic vitrectomy (DV) or vitreous opacities (n = 35). Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS. Results 20.6% of patients with MH/VMT, 8.5% of patients with ERM, and 5.7% of patients with DV or vitreous opacities had either intra-operative or post-operative breaks. Indication of MH/VMT versus ERM was a significant predictor for this outcome (p = .0112). The incidence of retinal breaks was higher in operations using 23-gauge versus 25-gauge PPV (25.0% vs. 7.4%, p &lt; .0001). Conclusions The presence of MH and/or VMT is a significant risk factor for retinal breaks from PPV, as is use of 23-gauge vitrectomy."
https://openalex.org/W4291020203,"Corn ethanol production has been growing in Brazil in the last ten years, generating by-products to feedlot diets. This study evaluates the effects of the inclusion of low-fat corn wet distillers grains (LF-WDG) on feeding behavior, ruminal health, liver abscesses and blood parameters of F1 Angus-Nellore bulls feedlot finished. Our hypothesis is that evaluation of data from feeding behavior, rumen and liver health would help to explain animal performance. In this trail, one-hundred animals were fed for 129 days with diets containing amounts of 0 (control), 15, 30 and 45% of LF-WDG replacing corn grain and soybean meal. Evaluations of fluctuation of dry matter intake (DMI) were carried out. Additionally, feeding behavior data were assessed by monitoring (24-h period) the feeding, rumination, time spent eating (TSE), and time expended on other activities (resting and number of meals per day). Blood variables such as pH, bicarbonate, total CO 2 content, and base excess in extracellular fluid (Beecf) were determined. After slaughter, rumen epithelium was classified according to the incidence of lesions (rumenitis) and abnormalities (papillae clumped), and samples were collected for morphology and histology evaluations. Moreover, livers were scored for severity of abscesses as follow: as unabscessed (0), one or two small abscesses (A−), two to four small active abscesses (A) or one or more large, active abscesses (A+). The DMI (kg/day) differed ( P = 0.03) among treatments and there is a tendency of 15 and 30 LF-WDG (% DM) had lower %DMI fluctuation compared to 0 or 45%. The TSE increased linearly ( P &lt; 0.01) as the amounts of inclusion of LF-WDG increased. Moreover, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) intake, NDF consumption rate and NDF rumination efficiency increased linearly ( P &lt; 0.01) in response to LF-WDG feeding. The incidence of rumenitis tended ( P = 0.08) to be greater at 45% LF-WDG, while keratin thickness decreased linearly in bulls fed LF-WDG ( P &lt; 0.01). The severity of liver abscesses (score A+) increased linearly ( P = 0.02). Regarding blood parameters, only Beecf decreased linearly ( P &lt; 0.01) in response to LF-WDG feeding. Therefore, the hypothesis of the current study was confirmed. We previous reported that F1 Angus-Nellore bulls fed LF-WDG show greater weight gain (1.94 ± 0.09 kg/day) and final body weight (620 ± 18.8 kg) when compare to control (1.8 ± 0.09 kg/day and 602 ± 18.8 kg, respectively). Here, we conclude that inclusion of 15 to 30% LF-WDG in feedlot diets improved feeding behavior without impairing ruminal health and blood parameters, driving performance and weigh gain of crossbred bulls. However, bulls fed 45% LF-WDG had greater severity of liver abscesses."
https://openalex.org/W4291020473,"Article presents the results of a complex traceological research of the famous statue of the ""prince""of Glauberg, found in an Early La Tène funeral complex in Glauberg (Hesse). Research focused also on two other fragments of related sandstone sculptures, found together with the Glauberger prince. The sandstone ""prince""of Glauberg was already in the past a subject of many archaeological studies. Nevertheless, all or absolute majority of them were focused on aspects of art historian nature or on the question of the origin, role and function of such sculptures in the Early Iron Age Central Europe. On the contrary, the aim of our research is oriented exclusively on the questions related to the manufacture of this sculpture, identification of used sculptor´s tools and applied working techniques. Our research was realised by means of digital documentation followed by the aplication of traceological methods. The character of the survived working traces on the sculpture´s surfaces was studied by mechanoscopy, while the material of used tools was determined by X-ray fluorescence. The reconstructions of used tools were compared with the existing tools as represented by the Iron Age archaeological finds. This comparison was oriented on the most relevant regions of developed La Tène culture, particularly on South Western Germany and Bohemia. However, also other relevant area, significant as the possible source of inspiration of Celtic sculptors for the creation of the monumental sculpture-Apennine peninsula, was taken into consideration. Our research revealed individual steps and phases during the sculpture´s manufacture, enabled the reconstrucion of used tools and confirmed real existence of such tools in mentioned regions. Finally it has brought first indices of the necessity of the distinguishing between ideological and technological aspects of related Celtic sculpture, when considering possible influence of Apennine peninsula on transalpine Central Europe."
https://openalex.org/W4291020546,"Background There is evidence that perceived urgency of medical complaints is associated with emergency care utilization. Patients’ perception of urgency can differ from physicians’ assessment. This study explored public perceptions of urgency of severe cases of COVID-19 and inflammatory gastrointestinal disease and analyzed variations in perceptions of urgency by characteristics of the afflicted person in the vignettes and sociodemographic characteristics of respondents. Methods Vignettes with severe symptoms of either inflammatory gastrointestinal disease or COVID-19 with comparable urgency of treatment were used in a telephone survey in Germany (N = 1,207). Besides disease, the vignettes varied in terms of sex, age (child, middle-aged person, old person) and daytime (Tuesday morning, Tuesday evening). Respondents were asked to rate the urgency of the reported symptoms with four items. A sum scale was computed. Variations in perceptions of urgency according to vignette characteristics and sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents (sex, age, educational level, migration background, children (yes/no) and personal affliction) were analyzed using a linear regression model. Results In terms of vignette characteristics, multivariate analysis showed a lower estimated urgency for males, as well as for the middle-aged and aged persons, compared to the child vignettes, and for COVID-19, compared to inflammatory gastrointestinal disease. Regarding the characteristics of the respondents, estimated urgency increased with age and was lower among respondents, who were previously affected by the symptoms themselves. Conclusion Although urgency in the vignettes was comparable, variations in estimated urgency by age and sex of the afflicted person and the described disease as well as age and personal affliction of the respondents were identified. This could result in an inadequate health care service utilization. Therefore, variations in public perceptions of urgency should be considered in the planning of public campaigns on adequate health care services utilization."

This study investigates the team structure of ML-related projects and analyzes the contribution of ML to scientific knowledge production under different team structure, drawing on bibliometric analyses of 25,000 scientific publications in various disciplines. Our regression analyses suggest that (1) interdisciplinary collaboration between domain scientists and computer scientists as well as the engagement of interdisciplinary individuals who have expertise in both domain and computer sciences are common in ML-related projects; (2) the engagement of interdisciplinary individuals seem more important in achieving high impact and novel discoveries, especially when a project employs computational and domain approaches interdependently; and (3) the contribution of ML and its implication to team structure depend on the depth of ML."
https://openalex.org/W4291020679,"Background Transurethral enucleation with bipolar (TUEB) is a safe and effective surgery for benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). However, few data exist concerning the influence of TUEB on erectile function (EF) in patients with BPO. Objective To evaluate the influence of TUEB on EF in patients with BPO at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Material and methods We prospectively enrolled 51 patients who underwent TUEB from June 2016 to April 2020. We evaluated maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), postvoid residual urine (PVR), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL), and International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) preoperatively and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. We classified the patients according to their preoperative IIEF-5 score into group 1 (IIEF-5 ≥10; n = 24) and group 2 (IIEF-5 &lt;10; n = 27), and for further evaluation of EF, into subgroups a: severe (IIEF-5 5–7), b: moderate (8–11), c: mild to moderate (12–16), d: mild (17–21), and e: no erectile dysfunction (22–25). Data are displayed as median or median (interquartile range). Results The study comprised 51 patients with a median age of 75 (70.5–79.5) years. Median prostate and transition zone volumes were 69.5 (46.5–78.8) mL and 30.5 (19–43) mL, respectively. Urinary function improved significantly when comparing respective preoperative, 3-month, and 12-month follow-up values: Qmax (7.6, 12.9, 15.2 mL/s), PVR (50, 0, 0 mL), IPSS (20.5, 9, 6), and QoL (5, 2, 2), respectively. There was no significant change in IIEF-5 score across the three time points: 9, 7, 8. The IIEF-5 score slightly but significantly increased between the preoperative and 12-month follow-up values in group 2 (5, 5, 6) and subgroup a (5, 5, 5). Conclusion TUEB was effective and safe surgery for patients with BPO and showed no significant influence on EF at 12-month follow-up after TUEB in patients with BPO."
https://openalex.org/W4291020733,"Inconsistent results have been reported on the association between folic acid use in pregnancy and risk of GDM. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between folic acid use and GDM in two population-based Nordic cohorts.Two cohort studies were conducted using data from the national population registers in Norway (2005-2018, n = 791,709) and Sweden (2006-2016, n = 1,112,817). Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between GDM and self-reported folic acid use and prescribed folic acid use, compared to non-users, adjusting for covariates. To quantify how potential unmeasured confounders may affect the estimates, E-values were reported. An exposure misclassification bias analysis was also performed.In Norwegian and Swedish cohorts, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for maternal self-reported folic acid use were 1.10 (1.06-1.14) and 0.89 (0.85-0.93), with E-values of 1.43 (1.31) and 1.50 (1.36), respectively. For prescribed folic acid use, ORs were 1.33 (1.15-1.53) and 1.56 (1.41-1.74), with E-values of 1.99 (1.57) and 2.49 (2.17), in Norway and Sweden respectively.The slightly higher or lower odds for GDM in self-reported users of folic acid in Norway and Sweden respectively, are likely not of clinical relevance and recommendations for folic acid use in pregnancy should remain unchanged. The two Nordic cohorts showed different directions of the association between self-reported folic acid use and GDM, but based on bias analysis, exposure misclassification is an unlikely explanation since there may still be differences in prevalence of use and residual confounding. Prescribed folic acid is used by women with specific comorbidities and co-medications, which likely underlies the higher odds for GDM."
https://openalex.org/W4291021413,"Precise evaluation of motor functions using simple and reproducible tests for mouse models of spinal cord injury (SCI) are required. Overground walking of SCI mice has been tested by Basso Mouse Scale for locomotion (BMS). In contrast, only a few works quantify walking performances of SCI mice on narrow beams, a different task. Here, we established a novel scoring system using a single beam walking apparatus for SCI mice. The scoring system uses binary judgments of values such as retention, moving forward and reaching the goal on a beam for rating. In addition, high score was given to SCI mouse when the mouse efficiently used hindlimbs for locomotion on the beam. A high rate of concordance of the score derived from positions of hindlimbs between two observers was obtained. Mice displayed the lowest total score on the beam immediately after the SCI, then the score gradually increased like time course of BMS score. Furthermore, the total scores reflected gradation of severity of SCI in 2 strains of mice. The beam walking score proved to be strongly correlated with that of BMS score, indicating that performances between overground walking and beam walking are partly correlated in SCI mice. Collectively, the novel scoring system offers an opportunity to easily evaluate motor performances of mice with SCI."
https://openalex.org/W4291021639,"Several studies show that religion hinders concerns for the natural environment preservation. Others, however, have found that the belief in God or the identification with a particular religion is not associated with measures for environmental concerns. This study investigates the influence of religious narrative framing and the relation between Allport’s intrinsic personal (IP) and extrinsic social (ES) religious orientation towards general environmental apathy (GEA) and acceptability for harming animals (AIS). This study surveyed 657 teachers and school staff in East Java, Indonesia. Using ANOVA, we find that religious narrative affects participant’s GEA and AIS. Participants in stewardship narrative group have significantly lower GEA and AIS compared to participants in human dominance and the non-narratives control group. Using multiple regression, we also confirm the persistence of religious narrative’s influence towards GEA. In addition, lower GEA and AIS correlate with higher IP and lower ES. Lastly, we identify and discuss significant demographic and other determinants relation to GEA and AIS."
