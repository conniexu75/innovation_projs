Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users’ friends, and friends of friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between ‘close friends’ who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world behaviour in human social networks."

https://openalex.org/W2142759365,"Unlike activated CD4(+) T cells, resting CD4(+) T cells are highly resistant to productive HIV-1 infection. Early after HIV-1 entry, a major block limits reverse transcription of incoming viral genomes. Here we show that the deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 prevents reverse transcription of HIV-1 RNA in resting CD4(+) T cells. SAMHD1 is abundantly expressed in resting CD4(+) T cells circulating in peripheral blood and residing in lymphoid organs. The early restriction to infection in unstimulated CD4(+) T cells is overcome by HIV-1 or HIV-2 virions into which viral Vpx is artificially or naturally packaged, respectively, or by addition of exogenous deoxynucleosides. Vpx-mediated proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1 and elevation of intracellular deoxynucleotide pools precede successful infection by Vpx-carrying HIV. Resting CD4(+) T cells from healthy donors following SAMHD1 silencing or from a patient with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome homozygous for a nonsense mutation in SAMHD1 were permissive for HIV-1 infection. Thus, SAMHD1 imposes an effective restriction to HIV-1 infection in the large pool of noncycling CD4(+) T cells in vivo. Bypassing SAMHD1 was insufficient for the release of viral progeny, implicating other barriers at later stages of HIV replication. Together, these findings may unveil new ways to interfere with the immune evasion and T cell immunopathology of pandemic HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2120719801,"Analysis of observations on six continents reveals a global preference for afternoon rain to fall on locally drier soils—contrary to the predictions of large-scale climate models, and suggesting that such models may exaggerate the occurrence of droughts. Soil moisture is known to influence precipitation across a range of scales in time and space, and most models suggest that wetter soils promote higher atmospheric moisture content and favour the local development of storms. But this analysis of global precipitation data from a combination of weather satellites shows that — especially in semi-arid regions — afternoon precipitation is more likely over dry soil than over wet soil. The findings suggest that current climate models may be missing fundamental processes regulating convection and land–atmosphere interactions. Land surface properties, such as vegetation cover and soil moisture, influence the partitioning of radiative energy between latent and sensible heat fluxes in daytime hours. During dry periods, soil-water deficit can limit evapotranspiration, leading to warmer and drier conditions in the lower atmosphere1,2. Soil moisture can influence the development of convective storms through such modifications of low-level atmospheric temperature and humidity1,3, which in turn feeds back on soil moisture. Yet there is considerable uncertainty in how soil moisture affects convective storms across the world, owing to a lack of observational evidence and uncertainty in large-scale models4. Here we present a global-scale observational analysis of the coupling between soil moisture and precipitation. We show that across all six continents studied, afternoon rain falls preferentially over soils that are relatively dry compared to the surrounding area. The signal emerges most clearly in the observations over semi-arid regions, where surface fluxes are sensitive to soil moisture, and convective events are frequent. Mechanistically, our results are consistent with enhanced afternoon moist convection driven by increased sensible heat flux over drier soils, and/or mesoscale variability in soil moisture. We find no evidence in our analysis of a positive feedback—that is, a preference for rain over wetter soils—at the spatial scale (50–100 kilometres) studied. In contrast, we find that a positive feedback of soil moisture on simulated precipitation does dominate in six state-of-the-art global weather and climate models—a difference that may contribute to excessive simulated droughts in large-scale models."
https://openalex.org/W2167597870,"Popularity is attractive -- this is the formula underlying preferential attachment, a popular explanation for the emergence of scaling in growing networks. If new connections are made preferentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution of the number of connections that nodes have follows power laws observed in many real networks. Preferential attachment has been directly validated for some real networks, including the Internet. Preferential attachment can also be a consequence of different underlying processes based on node fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks, or duplication. Here we show that popularity is just one dimension of attractiveness. Another dimension is similarity. We develop a framework where new connections, instead of preferring popular nodes, optimize certain trade-offs between popularity and similarity. The framework admits a geometric interpretation, in which popularity preference emerges from local optimization. As opposed to preferential attachment, the optimization framework accurately describes large-scale evolution of technological (Internet), social (web of trust), and biological (E.coli metabolic) networks, predicting the probability of new links in them with a remarkable precision. The developed framework can thus be used for predicting new links in evolving networks, and provides a different perspective on preferential attachment as an emergent phenomenon."

https://openalex.org/W2089761608,"Embryonic stem cells can replicate continuously in the absence of senescence and, therefore, are immortal in culture. Although genome stability is essential for the survival of stem cells, proteome stability may have an equally important role in stem-cell identity and function. Furthermore, with the asymmetric divisions invoked by stem cells, the passage of damaged proteins to daughter cells could potentially destroy the resulting lineage of cells. Therefore, a firm understanding of how stem cells maintain their proteome is of central importance. Here we show that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit high proteasome activity that is correlated with increased levels of the 19S proteasome subunit PSMD11 (known as RPN-6 in Caenorhabditis elegans) and a corresponding increased assembly of the 26S/30S proteasome. Ectopic expression of PSMD11 is sufficient to increase proteasome assembly and activity. FOXO4, an insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) responsive transcription factor associated with long lifespan in invertebrates, regulates proteasome activity by modulating the expression of PSMD11 in hESCs. Proteasome inhibition in hESCs affects the expression of pluripotency markers and the levels of specific markers of the distinct germ layers. Our results suggest a new regulation of proteostasis in hESCs that links longevity and stress resistance in invertebrates to hESC function and identity."
https://openalex.org/W2066977609,"Regular physical activity has a positive impact on cognition and brain function. Here we investigated if a single bout of exercise can improve motor memory and motor skill learning. We also explored if the timing of the exercise bout in relation to the timing of practice has any impact on the acquisition and retention of a motor skill. Forty-eight young subjects were randomly allocated into three groups, which practiced a visuomotor accuracy-tracking task either before or after a bout of intense cycling or after rest. Motor skill acquisition was assessed during practice and retention was measured 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days after practice. Differences among groups in the rate of motor skill acquisition were not significant. In contrast, both exercise groups showed a significantly better retention of the motor skill 24 hours and 7 days after practice. Furthermore, compared to the subjects that exercised before practice, the subjects that exercised after practice showed a better retention of the motor skill 7 days after practice. These findings indicate that one bout of intense exercise performed immediately before or after practicing a motor task is sufficient to improve the long-term retention of a motor skill. The positive effects of acute exercise on motor memory are maximized when exercise is performed immediately after practice, during the early stages of memory consolidation. Thus, the timing of exercise in relation to practice is possibly an important factor regulating the effects of acute exercise on long-term motor memory."

https://openalex.org/W1980419605,"The ability to process relevant stimuli selectively is a fundamental function of the primate visual system. The best-understood correlate of this function is the enhanced response of neurons in the visual cortex to attended stimuli. However, recent results show that the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure, also has a crucial role in visual attention. It has been assumed that the SC acts through the same well-known mechanisms in the visual cortex. Here we tested this hypothesis by transiently inactivating the SC during a motion-change-detection task and measuring responses in two visual cortical areas. We found that despite large deficits in visual attention, the enhanced responses of neurons in the visual cortex to attended stimuli were unchanged. These results show that the SC contributes to visual attention through mechanisms that are independent of the classic effects in the visual cortex, demonstrating that other processes must have key roles in visual attention."
https://openalex.org/W2068218660,"Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) in cytosol is the only known reductant of oxidized thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) in vivo so far. We and others found that aurothioglucose (ATG), a well known active-site inhibitor of TrxR1, inhibited TrxR1 activity in HeLa cell cytosol but had no effect on the viability of the cells. Using a redox Western blot analysis, no change was observed in redox state of Trx1, which was mainly fully reduced with five sulfhydryl groups. In contrast, auranofin killed cells and oxidized Trx1, also targeting mitochondrial TrxR2 and Trx2. Combining ATG with ebselen gave a strong synergistic effect, leading to Trx1 oxidation, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and cell death. We hypothesized that there should exist a backup system to reduce Trx1 when only TrxR1 activity was lost. Our results showed that physiological concentrations of glutathione, NADPH, and glutathione reductase reduced Trx1 in vitro and that the reaction was strongly stimulated by glutaredoxin1. Simultaneous depletion of TrxR activity by ATG and glutathione by buthionine sulfoximine led to overoxidation of Trx1 and loss of HeLa cell viability. In conclusion, the glutaredoxin system and glutathione have a backup role to keep Trx1 reduced in cells with loss of TrxR1 activity. Monitoring the redox state of Trx1 shows that cell death occurs when Trx1 is oxidized, followed by general protein oxidation catalyzed by the disulfide form of thioredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1965528910,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor kinases are tightly regulated to control development and tissue homeostasis. Mutant receptor kinase domains escape regulation leading to severely degenerative diseases and represent an important therapeutic target. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare but devastating disorder of extraskeletal bone formation. FOP-associated mutations in the BMP receptor ALK2 reduce binding of the inhibitor FKBP12 and promote leaky signaling in the absence of ligand. To establish structural mechanisms of receptor regulation and to address the effects of FOP mutation, we determined the crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of ALK2 in complex with the inhibitors FKBP12 and dorsomorphin. FOP mutations break critical interactions that stabilize the inactive state of the kinase, thereby facilitating structural rearrangements that diminish FKBP12 binding and promote the correct positioning of the glycine-serine-rich loop and αC helix for kinase activation. The balance of these effects accounts for the comparable activity of R206H and L196P. Kinase activation in the clinically benign mutant L196P is far weaker than R206H but yields equivalent signals due to the stronger interaction of FKBP12 with R206H. The presented ALK2 structure offers a valuable template for the further design of specific inhibitors of BMP signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2029756055,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains show strain-to-strain variation in resistance level, in genetic background, and also in the structure of the chromosomal cassette (SCCmec) that carries the resistance gene mecA. In contrast, strain-to-strain variation in the sequence of the mecA determinant was found to be much more limited among MRSA isolates examined so far. The first exception to this came with the recent identification of MRSA strain LGA251, which carries a new homolog of this gene together with regulatory elements mecI/mecR that also have novel, highly divergent structures. After cloning and purification in Escherichia coli, PBP2A(LGA), the protein product of the new mecA homolog, showed aberrant mobility in SDS-PAGE, structural instability and loss of activity at 37 °C, and a higher relative affinity for oxacillin as compared with cefoxitin. The mecA homolog free of its regulatory elements was cloned into a plasmid and introduced into the background of the β-lactam-susceptible S. aureus strain COL-S. In this background, the mecA homolog expressed a high-level resistance to cefoxitin (MIC = 400 μg/ml) and a somewhat lower resistance to oxacillin (minimal inhibitory concentration = 200 μg/ml). Similar to PBP2A, the protein homolog PBP2A(LGA) was able to replace the essential function of the S. aureus PBP2 for growth. In contrast to PBP2A, PBP2A(LGA) did not depend on the transglycosylase activity of the native PBP2 for expression of high level resistance to oxacillin, suggesting that the PBP2A homolog may preferentially cooperate with a monofunctional transglycosylase as the alternative source of transglycosylase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2008128981,"STE20/SPS-1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-related kinase (OSR1) activate the potassium-dependent sodium-chloride co-transporter, NKCC2, and thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter, NCC, in vitro, and both co-localize with a kinase regulatory molecule, Cab39/MO25α, at the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb (TAL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Yet genetic ablation of SPAK in mice causes a selective loss of NCC function, whereas NKCC2 becomes hyperphosphorylated. Here, we explore the underlying mechanisms in wild-type and SPAK-null mice. Unlike in the DCT, OSR1 remains at the TAL apical membrane of KO mice where it is accompanied by an increase in the active, phosphorylated form of AMP-activated kinase. We found an alterative SPAK isoform (putative SPAK2 form), which modestly inhibits co-transporter activity in vitro, is more abundant in the medulla than the cortex. Thus, enhanced NKCC2 phosphorylation in the SPAK knock-out may be explained by removal of inhibitory SPAK2, sustained activity of OSR1, and activation of other kinases. By contrast, the OSR1/SPAK/M025α signaling apparatus is disrupted in the DCT. OSR1 becomes largely inactive and displaced from M025α and NCC at the apical membrane, and redistributes to dense punctate structures, containing WNK1, within the cytoplasm. These changes are paralleled by a decrease in NCC phosphorylation and a decrease in the mass of the distal convoluted tubule, exclusive to DCT1. As a result of the dependent nature of OSR1 on SPAK in the DCT, NCC is unable to be activated. Consequently, SPAK(-/-) mice are highly sensitive to dietary salt restriction, displaying prolonged negative sodium balance and hypotension."
https://openalex.org/W2112103567,"Obesity is closely associated with the progression of vascular disorders, including atherosclerosis and postangioplasty restenosis. C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) 9 is an adipocytokine that is down-regulated in obese mice. Here we investigated whether CTRP9 modulates neointimal hyperplasia and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Left femoral arteries of wild-type (WT) mice were injured by a steel wire. An adenoviral vector expressing CTRP9 (Ad-CTRP9) or β-galactosidase as a control was intravenously injected into WT mice 3 d before vascular injury. Delivery of Ad-CTRP9 significantly attenuated the neointimal thickening and the number of bromode-oxyuridine-positive proliferating cells in the injured arteries compared with that of control. Treatment of VSMCs with CTRP9 protein attenuated the proliferative and chemotactic activities induced by growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, and suppressed PDGF-BB-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK. CTRP9 treatment dose-dependently increased cAMP levels in VSMCs. Blockade of cAMP-PKA pathway reversed the inhibitory effect of CTRP9 on DNA synthesis and ERK phosphorylation in response to PDGF-BB. The present data indicate that CTRP9 functions to attenuate neointimal formation following vascular injury through its ability to inhibit VSMC growth via cAMP-dependent mechanism, suggesting that the therapeutic approaches to enhance CTRP9 production could be valuable for prevention of vascular restenosis after angioplasty.—Uemura, Y., Shibata, R., Ohashi, K., Enomoto, T., Kambara, T., Yamamoto, T., Ogura, Y., Yuasa, D., Joki, Y., Matsuo, K., Miyabe, M., Kataoka, Y., Murohara, T., Ouchi, N.

https://openalex.org/W2156099288,"The development of a biofilm constitutes a survival strategy by providing bacteria a protective environment safe from stresses such as microbicide action and can thus lead to important health-care problems. In this study, biofilm resistance of a Bacillus subtilis strain (called hereafter NDmedical) recently isolated from endoscope washer-disinfectors to peracetic acid was investigated and its ability to protect the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus in mixed biofilms was evaluated. Biocide action within Bacillus subtilis biofilms was visualised in real time using a non-invasive 4D confocal imaging method. The resistance of single species and mixed biofilms to peracetic acid was quantified using standard plate counting methods and their architecture was explored using confocal imaging and electronic microscopy. The results showed that the NDmedical strain demonstrates the ability to make very large amount of biofilm together with hyper-resistance to the concentration of PAA used in many formulations (3500 ppm). Evidences strongly suggest that the enhanced resistance of the NDmedical strain was related to the specific three-dimensional structure of the biofilm and the large amount of the extracellular matrix produced which can hinder the penetration of peracetic acid. When grown in mixed biofilm with Staphylococcus aureus, the NDmedical strain demonstrated the ability to protect the pathogen from PAA action, thus enabling its persistence in the environment. This work points out the ability of bacteria to adapt to an extremely hostile environment, and the necessity of considering multi-organism ecosystems instead of single species model to decipher the mechanisms of biofilm resistance to antimicrobials agents."
https://openalex.org/W1982773582,"APETx3, a novel peptide isolated from the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima, is a naturally occurring mutant from APETx1, only differing by a Thr to Pro substitution at position 3. APETx1 is believed to be a selective modulator of human ether-á-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channels with a K(d) of 34 nM. In this study, APETx1, 2, and 3 have been subjected to an electrophysiological screening on a wide range of 24 ion channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes: 10 cloned voltage-gated sodium channels (Na(V) 1.2-Na(V)1.8, the insect channels DmNa(V)1, BgNa(V)1-1a, and the arachnid channel VdNa(V)1) and 14 cloned voltage-gated potassium channels (K(V)1.1-K(V)1.6, K(V)2.1, K(V)3.1, K(V)4.2, K(V)4.3, K(V)7.2, K(V)7.4, hERG, and the insect channel Shaker IR). Surprisingly, the Thr3Pro substitution results in a complete abolishment of APETx3 modulation on hERG channels and provides this toxin the ability to become a potent (EC(50) 276 nM) modulator of voltage-gated sodium channels (Na(V)s) because it slows down the inactivation of mammalian and insect Na(V) channels. Our study also shows that the homologous toxins APETx1 and APETx2 display promiscuous properties since they are also capable of recognizing Na(V) channels with IC(50) values of 31 nM and 114 nM, respectively, causing an inhibition of the sodium conductance without affecting the inactivation. Our results provide new insights in key residues that allow these sea anemone toxins to recognize distinct ion channels with similar potency but with different modulatory effects. Furthermore, we describe for the first time the target promiscuity of a family of sea anemone toxins thus far believed to be highly selective."

The PtdIns3P signaling pathway is important for autophagy. Yeast Vps34 forms an autophagy-specific complex containing Atg14, Vps30/Atg6, and Vps15 and is important for the organization of the phagophore assembly site (PAS) (5Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N.

Whereas the function of the nuclear population of Pik1 remains unclear, the Golgi-localized Pik1 is essential for secretory vesicle exit from the trans-Golgi network. Plasma membrane-localized Stt4 is involved in the Slt2 MAP kinase cascade (7Audhya A. Emr S.D.

A previous study reported that PtdIns4P is required for peroxisome degradation by selective autophagy in the yeast Pichia pastoris (10Yamashita S. Oku M. Wasada Y. Ano Y. Sakai Y. PI4P-signaling pathway for the synthesis of a nascent membrane structure in selective autophagy.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this regard, PtdIns4P is generated by PpPik1 and is thought to participate in the formation of a pexophagy-specific membrane structure, termed the micropexophagic apparatus. The key autophagy-related (Atg) protein that binds this phosphoinositide in P. pastoris is PpAtg26; however, the homologous protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not have a role in autophagy (11Cao Y. Klionsky D.J. Atg26 is not involved in autophagy-related pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Autophagy. 2007; 3: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These findings raise several important questions. For example, is PtdIns4P involved in other types of autophagy aside from pexophagy? P. pastoris, which is a methylotrophic yeast, has a Golgi complex that, in contrast to that of S. cerevisiae, is morphologically organized in a manner similar to the Golgi complex of mammalian cells. Accordingly, it is not clear whether PtdIns 4-kinases would play an equivalent role in budding yeast. In this report we analyzed the role of PtdIns 4-kinases in both selective and non-selective autophagic pathways and examined their mechanistic roles. Our data suggest that PtdIns 4-kinases have a conserved function in autophagy regulation. In yeast, defects in PtdIns 4-kinase activity affect trafficking of Atg9 and cause blocks both in nonselective autophagy and mitophagy.

Starvation experiments were performed in SD-N (synthetic medium lacking nitrogen; 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate or amino acids and 2% glucose). For temperature-sensitive mutants, cells were grown at 24 °C to midlog phase and shifted to 37 °C for 30 min to inactivate the mutants. If not otherwise indicated, cells were grown at 30 °C.

To construct pCuRFP-Atg8(405), RFP was first cloned into the SpeI/XmaI sites of pCu416 to generate pCuRFP(416) followed by cloning of ATG8 into the XmaI/SalI sites of pCuRFP(416), and then the CuRFP-Atg8 coding sequence from pCuRFP-Atg8(416) was amplified and cloned into the SacII/BamHI sites of pRS405. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental S2. Gene disruption and C-terminal tagging were carried out using a PCR-based method as described previously (14Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R.

For integration of Cu3HA-Pik1, pCu3HA-Pik1(405) was linearized with BglII and integrated into the PIK1 locus. To integrate Atg9–3GFP, the pAtg9–3GFP(306) plasmid was linearized with BglII and integrated into the ATG9 genomic locus (16Monastyrska I. He C. Geng J. Hoppe A.D. Li Z. Klionsky D.J.

RFP-Ape1 was incorporated into the chromosome by integrating AvrII-digested pRFP-Ape1(305) into the APE1 locus (17Strømhaug P.E. Reggiori F. Guan J. Wang C.-W. Klionsky D.J.

To integrate GFP-Atg8 and RFP-Atg8, pGFP-Atg8(405) and pRFP-Atg8(405) were linearized with AflII and integrated into the LEU2 locus. The integration of GFP-Osh2-PH has been described previously (18Roy A. Levine T.P. Multiple pools of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate detected using the pleckstrin homology domain of Osh2p.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44683-44689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To generate the pik1–11, and pik1–104 strains, the endogenous copy of PIK1 was replaced with mutant alleles by homologous recombination. First, the 333-base pair genomic region downstream of the PIK1 ORF including its terminator was cloned and ligated into the SacI/SacII sites of pFA6a-KAN or pFA6a-TRP1, which are downstream of the KAN or TRP1 genes. Next, the pik1–11 and pik1–104 sequences plus the CYC1 terminator were amplified by PCR from pCuGFP-pik1–11(416) and pCuGFP-pik1–104(416), respectively, and inserted into the XmaI/BglII sites of pFA6a-KAN or pFA6a-TRP1, which are upstream of the KAN or TRP1 genes, to complete the pFA6a-pik1–11-KAN, pFA6a-pik1–104-KAN, pFA6a-pik1–11-TRP1, and pFA6a-pik1–104-TRP1 plasmids. Then these plasmids were digested with XmaI/SacII, and the resulting fragments were transformed into yeast cells to replace the endogenous copy of PIK1. Incorporation of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were cultured in YPD or SMD selective media to mid-log phase and then shifted to SD-N medium as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh SMD to reflect growing conditions or in SD-N for starvation conditions. Cells were visualized with a microscope (DeltaVision Spectris; Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) fitted with differential interference contrast optics and an Olympus camera IX-HLSH100. For each microscopy picture, 10–12 Z-section images were captured. The distance between two neighboring sections was 0.2–0.5 μm, and the total depth of each stack was 5.5 μm, which is the approximate diameter of a normal yeast cell. The images were deconvolved using softWoRx software (Applied Precision). To monitor bulk autophagy, the Pho8Δ60 assay and the GFP-Atg8 processing assay were performed as previously described (19Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Novel system for monitoring autophagy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 20Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Cargo proteins facilitate the formation of transport vesicles in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29889-29894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Om45-GFP processing and mitoPho8Δ60 assays were performed as described previously (21Kanki T. Wang K. Klionsky D.J. A genomic screen for yeast mutants defective in mitophagy.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the PtdIns kinases in autophagy, we first examined the autophagic phenotype of a pik1 mutant using a well established procedure, the GFP-Atg8 processing assay. The ubiquitin-like protein Atg8 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine and remains associated with the completed autophagosome. When transported into the vacuole during autophagy, GFP-tagged Atg8 is hydrolyzed to yield free GFP. Thus, the relatively stable GFP moiety reflects the level of autophagy (20Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Cargo proteins facilitate the formation of transport vesicles in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29889-29894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Using this method, we observed a strong autophagic defect in the temperature sensitive pik1–104 mutant (Fig. 1A). In nutrient-rich conditions at both the permissive temperature (PT) and non-permissive temperature (NPT), there was essentially no detectable free GFP as expected. After a 2-h nitrogen starvation at 24 °C there was a clear appearance of the free GFP band in wild-type and pik1 mutant cells. However, at 37 °C, significantly reduced free GFP was detected in the pik1–104 strain compared with the wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). To rule out the possibility that the observed autophagic defect might be due to cell death caused by inactivation of Pik1, which is an essential protein, we shifted the cells back to the PT for another 2-h starvation (recovery period (R)); we observed a clear induction of GFP-Atg8 processing during the recovery period, demonstrating that autophagy induction was restored and that the cells were still viable (Fig. 1A). The autophagy defect was rescued by a plasmid expressing the PIK1 gene chromosomally integrated into the pik1 mutant, suggesting the autophagic defect was indeed due to the functional impairment of Pik1 (data not shown). To further confirm our observations, we used the Pho8Δ60 assay to quantitatively analyze the autophagic defect in the pik1 mutant. PHO8 encodes a vacuolar alkaline phosphatase, and its delivery into the vacuole through the secretory pathway is dependent on its N-terminal transmembrane domain (22Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Membrane protein sorting. Biosynthesis, transport, and processing of yeast vacuolar alkaline phosphatase.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Pho8Δ60 is a truncated form that lacks the 60 N-terminal amino acid residues including the transmembrane domain; this altered protein is unable to enter the endoplasmic reticulum, remains in the cytosol, and is delivered into the vacuole only through bulk autophagy (19Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Novel system for monitoring autophagy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In this way, the magnitude of bulk autophagy is quantified by measuring the activity of alkaline phosphatase in nitrogen starvation conditions. After a 4-h nitrogen starvation, wild-type cells showed a strong increase in Pho8Δ60 activity at both 24 and 37 °C, whereas the atg1Δ strain that is defective in autophagy showed only background levels of activity (Fig. 1B). In pik1–104, although the induction of the Pho8Δ60 activity was normal at the PT, there was essentially no increase at the NPT. Similar to the results from the GFP-Atg8 processing assay, the Pho8Δ60 activity of pik1–104 was partially recovered when the cells were shifted back to the PT (recovery) or upon the introduction of plasmid-expressed PIK1 (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Consistent with a previous publication (23Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Yeast homologue of neuronal frequenin is a regulator of phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), our sequence analysis showed that the temperature-sensitive pik1–104 allele contains mutations (S412P, A455T, Y517H, D529G, Q731R, R802G) that are located within the C-terminal catalytic kinase domain of Pik1. This suggests that the PtdIns 4-kinase activity of Pik1 could be essential for autophagy. However, we also considered the possibility that these point mutations may affect the stability of the Pik1 protein at NPT. To test this, we examined Pik1 in temperature-sensitive mutant strains. When shifted to the NPT for 2 h, three Pik1 temperature-sensitive alleles, pik1–11, pik1–83, and pik1–104 all showed a decreased protein level (data not shown), suggesting that these point mutations destabilized Pik1 at the NPT. To extend our analysis on the requirement of Pik1 activity (i.e. the generation of PtdIns4P) for autophagy, we decided to examine an additional mutant strain that affects Pik1 function and the levels of PtdIns4P at the Golgi complex. The phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol transfer protein Sec14 is required for the transport of vesicles from the trans-Golgi (24Bankaitis V.A. Aitken J.R. Cleves A.E. Dowhan W. An essential role for a phospholipid transfer protein in yeast Golgi function.Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 25Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SEC14 gene encodes a cytosolic factor that is required for transport of secretory proteins from the yeast Golgi complex.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and the sec14-3 mutant displays a major reduction in PtdIns4P, generating ∼50% of the wild-type level (26Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. Direct involvement of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in secretion in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34294-34300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether autophagy is affected in the sec14-3 mutant using the GFP-Atg8 processing assay. The sec14-3 mutant cells displayed a clear absence of free GFP after 2 h of starvation at the NPT, indicating an autophagic defect, and this defect was recovered after the cells were shifted back to the PT (Fig. 2), indicating that the generation of PtdIns4P, dependent on Sec14 and Pik1, is essential for autophagy. Pik1 localizes to both the Golgi and the nucleus (8Strahl T. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Thorner J. Yeast phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, Pik1, has essential roles at the Golgi and in the nucleus.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To test which population of Pik1 is involved in autophagy, we analyzed a regulatory subunit of Pik1, Frq1, which is targeted to the Golgi and is required for the recruitment of Pik1 to this organelle (8Strahl T. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Thorner J. Yeast phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, Pik1, has essential roles at the Golgi and in the nucleus.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Yeast homologue of neuronal frequenin is a regulator of phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As shown by the GFP-Atg8 processing assay, the frq1-1 mutant displayed a clear temperature-sensitive autophagy phenotype (Fig. 1A). At the NPT, the absence of free GFP after 2-h starvation indicated a defect of autophagy induction, and this defect was partially recovered after the cells were shifted back to the PT. As with the pik1–104 mutant, the autophagy impairment in the frq1-1 mutant was also observed using the Pho8Δ60 assay (Fig. 1B). This result suggested that the Golgi localization of Pik1 was essential for autophagy induction. PpPik1 was previously reported to play a role in pexophagy in P. pastoris (10Yamashita S. Oku M. Wasada Y. Ano Y. Sakai Y. PI4P-signaling pathway for the synthesis of a nascent membrane structure in selective autophagy.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that Pik1 may also play roles in selective autophagy in S. cerevisiae. Therefore, we extended our analysis of Pik1 to examine its role in mitophagy, the selective autophagic degradation of mitochondria. To detect mitophagy, we first utilized the Om45-GFP processing assay. OM45 encodes a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, and a chromosomally tagged version with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the C terminus is correctly localized on this organelle. Similar to the GFP-Atg8 processing assay, when mitophagy is induced, Om45-GFP, as part of the mitochondria, is delivered into the vacuole for degradation. Om45 is proteolytically removed or degraded, whereas the GFP moiety is relatively stable and accumulates in the vacuole. Therefore, mitophagy can be monitored based on the appearance of free GFP by immunoblot (27Kanki T. Klionsky D.J. Mitophagy in yeast occurs through a selective mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32386-32393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). When growing in rich medium containing lactate as the sole carbon source plus nitrogen (YPL), no free GFP band was detected at either 24 or 37 °C (Fig. 3A). After nitrogen starvation at 24 °C there was a clear appearance of the free GFP band in wild-type and pik1–104 mutant cells. At 37 °C, significantly reduced free GFP was detected in pik1–104 compared with the wild type (Fig. 3A), indicating a strong mitophagy block in the pik1–104 mutant. An atg32Δ mutant, which is completely defective in mitophagy, showed a complete block in Om45-GFP processing at either temperature as expected (28Kanki T. Wang K. Cao Y. Baba M. Klionsky D.J. Atg32 is a mitochondrial protein that confers selectivity during mitophagy.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 98-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). We also used the mitoPho8Δ60 assay to quantitatively examine the mitophagy defect in the pik1 mutant (21Kanki T. Wang K. Klionsky D.J. A genomic screen for yeast mutants defective in mitophagy.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mitoPho8Δ60 construct is a modified version of Pho8Δ60 that allows the quantitative measurement of mitophagy activity. If PHO8Δ60 is fused with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, the encoded protein is specifically localized to mitochondria, and the ensuing alkaline phosphatase activity becomes an indicator of mitophagy (21Kanki T. Wang K. Klionsky D.J. A genomic screen for yeast mutants defective in mitophagy.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When mitophagy was induced by nitrogen starvation, wild-type cells showed a dramatic increase in mitoPho8Δ60 activity at both 24 and 37 °C (Fig. 3B). In the pik1–104 mutant, mitophagy induction at the PT was comparable with wild-type cells. In contrast, at the NPT there was a clear decrease of mitoPho8Δ60 activity (Fig. 3B), although not as strong as that seen with the Om45-GFP assay (Fig. 3A). This difference may reflect the different sensitivities of these two assays. Nonetheless, together, these results demonstrate that Pik1 is also involved in selective autophagy, in particular mitophagy. To further extend our analysis, we explored the mechanism through which Pik1 participates in the regulation of selective and nonselective autophagy. Inactivation of Sec7, which is indispensable for post-Golgi transport, affects Atg9 trafficking to the PAS (29van der Vaart A. Griffith J. Reggiori F. Exit from the Golgi is required for the expansion of the autophagosomal phagophore in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Atg9 is the only known conserved transmembrane protein of the yeast autophagy core machinery. Atg9 cycles between the PAS and other peripheral cytoplasmic sites (termed Atg9 reservoirs) and is important for the recruitment of additional Atg proteins (30He C. Klionsky D.J. Atg9 trafficking in autophagy-related pathways.Autophagy. 2007; 3: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because Pik1 is also critical for secretion at the Golgi, we hypothesized that the anterograde movement of Atg9 to the PAS would also be affected in the pik1 mutant. To test this, we used the TAKA (transport of Atg9 after knocking out ATG1) assay (20Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Cargo proteins facilitate the formation of transport vesicles in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29889-29894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 31Klionsky D.J. Baehrecke E.H. Brumell J.H. Chu C.T. Codogno P. Cuervo A.M. Debnath J. Deretic V.

A comprehensive glossary of autophagy-related molecules and processes (2nd edition).Autophagy. 2011; 7: 1273-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In brief, this assay is based on previous findings that Atg9 is retrieved from the PAS back to peripheral sites, and this retrieval process requires the Atg1-Atg13 complex (32Reggiori F. Tucker K.A. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. The Atg1-Atg13 complex regulates Atg9 and Atg23 retrieval transport from the pre-autophagosomal structure.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar); atg1Δ cells accumulate Atg9 almost exclusively at the PAS as a single dot unless the introduction of a second mutation causes its impaired anterograde transport. To check Atg9 localization, we made a functional C-terminal triple GFP fusion protein (Atg9–3GFP); this triple GFP chimera appears stable and does not interfere with the normal function and proper localization of Atg9 (16Monastyrska I. He C. Geng J. Hoppe A.D. Li Z. Klionsky D.J. Arp2 links autophagic machinery with the actin cytoskeleton.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1962-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33He C.

Cell. 2008; 19: 5506-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As reported previously, in atg1Δ cells, under both growing (data not shown) and starvation conditions, Atg9–3GFP displayed exclusively one single dot at the PAS (marked by RFP-Ape1) irrespective of the temperature (Fig. 4A). At 24 °C, atg1Δ pik1–104 cells showed the same pattern as the atg1Δ cells, whereas at the NPT, Atg9 was present in multiple puncta under both growing (data not shown) and starvation conditions (Fig. 4A). In some cells one of these dots colocalized with the PAS. These data indicated that there was a substantial reduction, but not a complete block, in the anterograde movement of Atg9 to the PAS in the pik1–104 mutant. A similar trafficking defect was also observed for Atg27, which is another transmembrane protein that also shuttles among the PAS, Golgi complex, and other peripheral sites, in the pik1–104 (Fig. 4B) an"
https://openalex.org/W2059654443,"First-generation interaction maps of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) phosphosites have previously been generated using protein microarray (PM) technologies. Here, we developed a large-scale fluorescence polarization (FP) methodology that was able to characterize interactions between SH2 domains and ErbB receptor phosphosites with higher fidelity and sensitivity than was previously achieved with PMs. We used the FP assay to query the interaction of synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to 89 ErbB receptor intracellular tyrosine sites against 93 human SH2 domains and 2 phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. From 358,944 polarization measurements, the affinities for 1,405 unique biological interactions were determined, 83% of which are novel. In contrast to data from previous reports, our analyses suggested that ErbB2 was not more promiscuous than the other ErbB receptors. Our results showed that each receptor displays unique preferences in the affinity and location of recruited SH2 domains that may contribute to differences in downstream signaling potential. ErbB1 was enriched versus the other receptors for recruitment of domains from RAS GEFs whereas ErbB2 was enriched for recruitment of domains from tyrosine and phosphatidyl inositol phosphatases. ErbB3, the kinase inactive ErbB receptor family member, was predictably enriched for recruitment of domains from phosphatidyl inositol kinases and surprisingly, was enriched for recruitment of domains from tyrosine kinases, cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, and RHO GEFs but depleted for recruitment of domains from phosphatidyl inositol phosphatases. Many novel interactions were also observed with phosphopeptides corresponding to ErbB receptor tyrosines not previously reported to be phosphorylated by mass spectrometry, suggesting the existence of many biologically relevant RTK sites that may be phosphorylated but below the detection threshold of standard mass spectrometry procedures. This dataset represents a rich source of testable hypotheses regarding the biological mechanisms of ErbB receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2031359784,"The human polydeoxynucleotide cytidine deaminases APOBEC3A, APOBEC3C, and APOBEC3H are capable of mutating viral DNA in the nucleus, whereas APOBEC3A alone efficiently edits nuclear DNA. Deamination is rapidly followed by excision of uracil residues and can lead to double-stranded breaks. It is not known to which protein networks these DNA mutators belong. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the human homolog of Drosophila Tribbles 3, TRIB3, as an interactor for APOBEC3A and APOBEC3C. The interaction was confirmed by co-affinity purification. Co-transfection of APOBEC3A with a TRIB3 expression vector reduced nuclear DNA editing whereas siRNA knockdown of TRIB3 increased the levels of nuclear DNA editing, indicating that TRIB3 functioned as a repressor of A3A. It also repressed A3A-associated γH2AX positive double-stranded breaks. The interaction results in degradation of A3A in a proteasome-independent manner. TRIB3 has been linked to cancer and via its own interactors and links the A3A DNA mutators to the Rb-BRCA1-ATM network. TRIB3 emerges as an important guardian of genome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2042845019,"Placental P-glycoprotein (P-gp) acts to protect the developing fetus from exogenous compounds. This protection declines with advancing gestation leaving the fetus and fetal brain vulnerable to these compounds and potential teratogens in maternal circulation. This vulnerability may be more pronounced in pregnancies complicated by infection, which is common during pregnancy. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (released during infection) have been shown to be potent inhibitors of P-gp, but nothing is known regarding their effects at the developing blood-brain barrier (BBB). We hypothesized that P-gp function and expression in endothelial cells of the developing BBB will be inhibited by pro-inflammatory cytokines. We have derived brain endothelial cell (BEC) cultures from various stages of development of the guinea pig: gestational day (GD) 50, 65 (term ~68 days) and postnatal day (PND) 14. Once these cultures reached confluence, BECs were treated with various doses (10(0)-10(4 )pg/mL) of pro-inflammatory cytokines: interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α). P-gp function or abcb1 mRNA (encodes P-gp) expression was assessed following treatment. Incubation of GD50 BECs with IL-1β, IL-6 or TNF-α resulted in no change in P-gp function. GD65 BECs displayed a dose-dependent decrease in function with all cytokines tested; maximal effects at 42%, 65% and 34% with IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α treatment, respectively (P<0.01). Inhibition of P-gp function by IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α was even greater in PND14 BECs; maximal effects at 36% (P<0.01), 84% (P<0.05) and 55% (P<0.01), respectively. Cytokine-induced reductions in P-gp function were associated with decreased abcb1 mRNA expression. These data suggest that BBB P-gp function is increasingly responsive to the inhibitory effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with increasing developmental age. Thus, women who experience infection and take prescription medication during pregnancy may expose the developing fetal brain to greater amounts of exogenous compounds - many of which are considered potentially teratogenic."
https://openalex.org/W2072360697,"Recent studies have described a novel type of glial cell that is scattered across the inner layers of the avian retina and possibly the retinas of primates. These cells have been termed Non-astrocytic Inner Retinal Glial (NIRG) cells. These cells are stimulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) to proliferate, migrate distally into the retina, and become reactive. These changes in glial activity correlate with increased susceptibility of retinal neurons and Müller glia to excitotoxic damage. The purpose of this study was to further study the NIRG cells in retinas treated with IGF1 or acute damage. In response to IGF1, the reactivity, proliferation and migration of NIRG cells persists through 3 days after treatment. At 7 days after treatment, the numbers and distribution of NIRG cells returns to normal, suggesting that homeostatic mechanisms are in place within the retina to maintain the numbers and distribution of these glial cells. By comparison, IGF1-induced microglial reactivity persists for at least 7 days after treatment. In damaged retinas, we find a transient accumulation of NIRG cells, which parallels the accumulation of reactive microglia, suggesting that the reactivity of NIRG cells and microglia are linked. When the microglia are selectively ablated by the combination of interleukin 6 and clodronate-liposomes, the NIRG cells down-regulate transitin and perish within the following week, suggesting that the survival and phenotype of NIRG cells are somehow linked to the microglia. We conclude that the abundance, reactivity and retinal distribution of NIRG cells can be dynamic, are regulated by homoestatic mechanisms and are tethered to the microglia."
https://openalex.org/W2016269093,"Steady-state surface levels of the apical Na/K/2Cl cotransporter NKCC2 regulate NaCl reabsorption by epithelial cells of the renal thick ascending limb (THAL). We reported that constitutive endocytosis of NKCC2 controls NaCl absorption in native THALs; however, the pathways involved in NKCC2 endocytosis are unknown. We hypothesized that NKCC2 endocytosis at the apical surface depends on dynamin-2 and clathrin. Measurements of steady-state surface NKCC2 and the rate of NKCC2 endocytosis in freshly isolated rat THALs showed that inhibition of endogenous dynamin-2 with dynasore blunted NKCC2 endocytosis by 56 ± 11% and increased steady-state surface NKCC2 by 67 ± 27% (p < 0.05). Expression of the dominant negative Dyn2K44A in THALs slowed the rate of NKCC2 endocytosis by 38 ± 8% and increased steady-state surface NKCC2 by 37 ± 8%, without changing total NKCC2 expression. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis with chlorpromazine blunted NKCC2 endocytosis by 54 ± 6%, while preventing clathrin from interacting with synaptojanin also blunted NKCC2 endocytosis by 52 ± 5%. Disruption of lipid rafts blunted NKCC2 endocytosis by 39 ± 4% and silencing caveolin-1 by 29 ± 4%. Simultaneous inhibition of clathrin- and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis completely blocked NKCC2 internalization.

These are the first data identifying the endocytic pathway for apical NKCC2 endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2054373571,"Direct structural insight into the mechanisms underlying activation and desensitization remain unavailable for the pentameric ligand-gated channel family. Here, we report the structural rearrangements underlying gating transitions in membrane-embedded GLIC, a prokaryotic homologue, using site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We particularly probed the conformation of pore-lining second transmembrane segment (M2) under conditions that favor the closed and the ligand-bound desensitized states. The spin label mobility, intersubunit spin-spin proximity, and the solvent-accessibility parameters in the two states clearly delineate the underlying protein motions within M2. Our results show that during activation the extracellular hydrophobic region undergoes major changes involving an outward translational movement, away from the pore axis, leading to an increase in the pore diameter, whereas the lower end of M2 remains relatively immobile. Most notably, during desensitization, the intervening polar residues in the middle of M2 move closer to form a solvent-occluded barrier and thereby reveal the location of a distinct desensitization gate. In comparison with the crystal structure of GLIC, the structural dynamics of the channel in a membrane environment suggest a more loosely packed conformation with water-accessible intrasubunit vestibules penetrating from the extracellular end all the way to the middle of M2 in the closed state. These regions have been implicated to play a major role in alcohol and drug modulation. Overall, these findings represent a key step toward understanding the fundamentals of gating mechanisms in this class of channels."
https://openalex.org/W1983676906,"We have conducted the first study to determine the diagnostic potential of the CD14++CD16+ intermediate monocytes as compared to the pro-angiogenic subset of CD14++CD16+TIE2+ TIE2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) in cancer. These monocyte populations were investigated by flow cytometry in healthy volunteers (N = 32) and in colorectal carcinoma patients with localized (N = 24) or metastatic (N = 37) disease. We further determined blood levels of cytokines associated with monocyte regulation. The results revealed the intermediate monocyte subset to be significantly elevated in colorectal cancer patients and to show the highest frequencies in localized disease. Multivariate regression analysis identified intermediate monocytes as a significant independent variable in cancer prediction. With a cut-off value at 0.37% (intermediate monocytes of total leukocytes) the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity ranged at 69% and 81%, respectively. In contrast, TEM levels were elevated in localized cancer but did not differ significantly between groups and none of the cytokines correlated with monocyte subpopulations. Of interest, in vitro analyses supported the observation that intermediate monocytes were more potently induced by primary as opposed to metastatic cancer cells which may relate to the immunosuppressive milieu established in the advanced stage of metastatic disease. In conclusion, intermediate monocytes as compared to TIE2-expressing monocytes are a more sensitive diagnostic indicator of colorectal cancer."

Yet, the role of their coactivators in mouse embryonic stem cells remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrated that the nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (Ncoa3) is essential for pluripotency maintenance. Knockdown of Ncoa3 not only compromises the expression of pluripotency markers but also impairs in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential of mouse ESCs. Ncoa3 binds to the Nanog promoter and recruits the histone acetyltransferase CREB binding protein (CBP) and the histone arginine methyltransferase CARM1 to activate Nanog expression. Moreover, glycogen synthase kinase 3 GSK3 signaling down-regulates the Ncoa3 protein level to suppress Nanog expression. Thus, Ncoa3 not only contributes to self-renewal by activating Nanog but also facilitates ESC differentiation as a break point to disrupt the core transcriptional circuitry of pluripotency.

This study attempts to localize the somatotopic representation of the cornea to painful stimuli in human primary somatosensory cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this case study, a subject was imaged at 3T while bright light was presented in a block-design, which either produced pain and blinking (during photophobia) or blinking alone (after recovery from photophobia). Pain and blinking produced precisely localized activations in primary somatosensory cortex and primary motor cortex. These results indicate that noxious stimulation of the cornea can produce somatotopic activation in primary somatosensory cortex. This finding opens future avenues of research to evaluate the relationship between corneal pain and central brain mechanisms relating to the development of chronic pain conditions, such as dry eye-like symptoms."

We thus resorted to homoFRET detected by time-resolved Fluorescence Anisotropy IMaging (tr-FAIM). To specifically image the plasma membrane of living cells, an original combination of tr-FAIM and Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscope (TIRFLIM) was implemented. The correcting factor accounting for the depolarization due to the high numerical aperture (NA) objective, mandatory for TIRF microscopy, was quantified on fluorescein solutions and on HEK293 cells expressing enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (eGFP). Homodimerization of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), a key mechanism in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease, was measured on this original set-up. We showed, both in epifluorescence and under TIRF excitation, different energy transfer rates associated with the homodimerization of wild type APP-eGFP or of a mutated APP-eGFP, which forms constitutive dimers. This original set-up thus offers promising prospects for future studies of protein homodimerization in living cells in control and pathological conditions."

In this study, we have examined the role of the conserved Thr-257 and Thr-260 residues, located at the other end of α-helix 8 on the heme electronic environment and on activity. The mutations at the two positions destabilize PLP binding, leading to lower PLP content and ∼2- to ∼500-fold lower activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. Activity is unresponsive to PLP supplementation, consistent with the pyridoxine-nonresponsive phenotype of the T257M mutation in a homocystinuric patient.

https://openalex.org/W2022099686,"The trabecular meshwork (TM) cell-matrix interactions and factors that influence Rho signaling in TM cells are thought to play a pivotal role in the regulation of aqueous outflow. The current study was designed to evaluate the role of a carbohydrate-binding protein, galectin-8 (Gal8), in TM cell adhesion and Rho signaling.Normal human TM cells were assayed for Gal8 expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. To assess the role of Gal8 in TM cell adhesion and Rho signaling, the cell adhesion and spreading assays were performed on Gal8-coated culture plates in the presence and the absence of anti-β₁ integrin antibody and Rho and Rho-kinase inhibitors. In addition, the effect of Gal8-mediated cell-matrix interactions on TM cell cytoskeleton arrangement and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) phosphorylation was examined.We demonstrate here that Gal8 is expressed in the TM and a function-blocking anti-β₁ integrin antibody inhibits the adhesion and spreading of TM cells to Gal8-coated wells. Cell spreading on Gal8 substratum was associated with the accumulation of phosphorylated myosin light chain and the formation of stress fibers that was inhibited by the Rho inhibitor, C3 transferase, as well as by the Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y27632.The above findings present a novel function for Gal8 in activating Rho signaling in TM cells. This function may allow Gal8 to participate in the regulation of aqueous outflow."
https://openalex.org/W2028591711,"Inefficient intracellular protein trafficking is a critical issue in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases and in recombinant protein production. Here we investigated the trafficking of factor VIII (FVIII), which is affected in the coagulation disorder hemophilia A. We hypothesized that chemical chaperones may be useful to enhance folding and processing of FVIII in recombinant protein production, and as a therapeutic approach in patients with impaired FVIII secretion. A tagged B-domain-deleted version of human FVIII was expressed in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary cells to mimic the industrial production of this important protein. Of several chemical chaperones tested, the addition of betaine resulted in increased secretion of FVIII, by increasing solubility of intracellular FVIII aggregates and improving transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi. Similar results were obtained in experiments monitoring recombinant full-length FVIII. Oral betaine administration also increased FVIII and factor IX (FIX) plasma levels in FVIII or FIX knockout mice following gene transfer. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo applications of betaine were also able to rescue a trafficking-defective FVIII mutant (FVIIIQ305P). We conclude that chemical chaperones such as betaine might represent a useful treatment concept for hemophilia and other diseases caused by deficient intracellular protein trafficking."

Human CCR4+ tumor-bearing mice treated once with intravenous infusion of AAV8 virions encoding the h1567 (AAV8-h1567) minibody showed anti-tumor activity in vivo and increased survival. The AAV8-h1567 minibody notably increased the number of tumor-infiltrating Ly-6G+ FcγRIIIa(CD16A)+ murine neutrophils in the tumor xenografts over that of AAV8-control minibody treated mice. Furthermore, in CCR4+ tumor-bearing mice co-treated with AAV8-h1567 minibody and infused with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), marked tumor infiltration of human CD16A+ CD56+ NK cells was observed. The h1567 minibody also induced in vitro ADCC activity through both mouse neutrophils and human NK cells.Overall, our data demonstrate that the in vivo anti-tumor activity of h1567 minibody is mediated, at least in part, through CD16A+ immune effector cell ADCC mechanisms. These data further demonstrate the utility of the AAV-minibody gene transfer system in the rapid evaluation of candidate anti-tumor mAbs and the potency of h1567 as a potential novel therapy for CTCL."

Here, we report the biochemical and thermodynamic characterization of the Phytophthora infestans effector AVR3a in vitro. We show that the amino acids surrounding the RxLR leader mediate homodimerization of the protein. Dimerization was considerably attenuated by a localized mutation within the RxLR motif that was previously described to prevent translocation of the protein into host. Importantly, we confirm that the reported phospholipid-binding properties of AVR3a are mediated by its C-terminal effector domain, not its RxLR leader. However, we show that the observed phospholipid interaction is attributable to a weak association with denatured protein molecules and is therefore most likely physiologically irrelevant."

We propose that the protein-protein interface stabilizing the leading strand synthesis involves two distinct interactions: a stable binding of the helicase to the palm domain of the polymerase and an electrostatic binding of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the helicase to a basic patch on the polymerase. DNA primase facilitates binding of DNA helicase to ssDNA and contributes to formation of the DNA helicase-DNA polymerase complex by stabilizing DNA helicase."

These effects include changes in microclimate, solar radiation, or temperature. Such abiotic effects can, in turn, impact biotic factors. They can have a substantial impact on species, communities, and ecosystems. Here we examine clinal variations in stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values for trees along an edge-interior gradient in the dry deciduous forest at Ankarafantsika National Park. We predicted that soil respiration and differences in solar irradiance would result in stratified δ¹³C values where leaves collected close to the forest floor would have lower δ¹³C values than those growing higher up in the canopy. We also anticipated that plants growing at the savannah-forest boundary would have higher δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values than plants growing in the forest interior. As expected, we detected a small but significant canopy effect. Leaves growing below 2 m from the forest floor exhibit δ¹³C values that are, on average, 1.1‰ lower than those growing above this threshold. We did not, however, find any relationship between foliar δ¹³C and distance from the edge. Unpredictably, we detected a striking positive relationship between foliar δ¹⁵N values and increasing distance into the forest interior. Variability in physiology among species, anthropogenic influence, organic input, and rooting depth cannot adequately explain this trend. Instead, this unexpected relationship most likely reflects decreasing nutrient or water availability, or a shift in N-sources with increasing distance from the savannah. Unlike most forest communities, the trees at Ampijoroa are growing in nutrient-limited sands. In addition to being nutrient poor, these well-drained soils likely decrease the amount of soil water available to forest vegetation. Continued research on plant responses to edge effects will improve our understanding of the conservation biology of forest ecosystems in Madagascar."
https://openalex.org/W2167364237,"Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with risk of congestive heart failure (CHF), cognitive dysfunction and depression. CHF itself is linked both to poor cognition and depression. The ventricular N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a marker of CHF, suggesting potential as a marker for cognitive impairment and/or depression. This was tested in the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study (ET2DS). Methodology and Principal Findings Cross-sectional analysis of 1066 men and women aged 60–75 with type 2 diabetes. Results from seven neuropsychological tests were combined in a standardised general cognitive ability factor, ‘g’. A vocabulary-based test estimated pre-morbid cognitive ability. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessed possible depression. After adjustment for age and sex, raised plasma NT-proBNP was weakly associated with lower ‘g’ and higher depression scores (ß −0.09, 95% CI −0.13 to −0.03, p = 0.004 and ß 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12, p<0.001, respectively). Comparing extreme quintiles of NT-proBNP, subjects in the highest quintile were more likely to have reduced cognitive ability (within the lowest tertile of ‘g’) and ‘possible’ depression (HADS depression ≥8) (OR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.70; p = 0.005 and OR 2.18; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.71; p = 0.004, respectively). Associations persisted when pre-morbid ability was adjusted for, but as expected were no longer statistically significant following the adjustment for diabetes-related and vascular co-variates (β −0.02, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.03, p>0.05 for ‘g’; β 0.03, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.07, p>0.05 for depression scores). Conclusion Raised plasma NT-proBNP was weakly but statistically significantly associated with poorer cognitive function and depression. The prospective phases of the ET2DS will help determine whether or not NT-proBNP can be considered a risk marker for subsequent cognitive impairment and incident depression and whether it provides additional information over and above traditional risk factors for these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1986179597,"Loss of muscle force is a salient feature of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal disease caused by dystrophin deficiency. Assessment of force production from a single intact muscle has been considered as the gold standard for studying physiological consequences in murine models of DMD. Unfortunately, equivalent assays have not been established in dystrophic dogs. To fill the gap, we developed a novel in situ protocol to measure force generated by the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscle of a dog. We also determined the muscle length to fiber length ratio and the pennation angle of the ECU muscle. Muscle pathology and contractility were compared between normal and affected dogs. Absence of dystrophin resulted in marked histological damage in the ECU muscle of affected dogs. Central nucleation was significantly increased and myofiber size distribution was altered in the dystrophic ECU muscle. Muscle weight and physiological cross sectional area (PCSA) showed a trend of reduction in affected dogs although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Force measurement revealed a significant decrease of absolute force, and the PCSA or muscle weight normalized specific forces. To further characterize the physiological defect in affected dog muscle, we conducted eccentric contraction. Dystrophin-null dogs showed a significantly greater force loss following eccentric contraction damage. To our knowledge, this is the first convincing demonstration of force deficit in a single intact muscle in the canine DMD model. The method described here will be of great value to study physiological outcomes following innovative gene and/or cell therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1981850759,"In plants, relationships between resistance to herbivorous insect pests and growth are typically controlled by complex interactions between genetically correlated traits. These relationships often result in tradeoffs in phenotypic expression. In this study we used genetical genomics to elucidate genetic relationships between tree growth and resistance to white pine terminal weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck.) in a pedigree population of interior spruce (Picea glauca, P. engelmannii and their hybrids) that was growing at Vernon, B.C. and segregating for weevil resistance. Genetical genomics uses genetic perturbations caused by allelic segregation in pedigrees to co-locate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for gene expression and quantitative traits. Bark tissue of apical leaders from 188 trees was assayed for gene expression using a 21.8K spruce EST-spotted microarray; the same individuals were genotyped for 384 SNP markers for the genetic map. Many of the expression QTLs (eQTL) co-localized with resistance trait QTLs. For a composite resistance phenotype of six attack and oviposition traits, 149 positional candidate genes were identified. Resistance and growth QTLs also overlapped with eQTL hotspots along the genome suggesting that: 1) genetic pleiotropy of resistance and growth traits in interior spruce was substantial, and 2) master regulatory genes were important for weevil resistance in spruce. These results will enable future work on functional genetic studies of insect resistance in spruce, and provide valuable information about candidate genes for genetic improvement of spruce."
https://openalex.org/W2027916483,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an exclusively human pathogen. Streptococcal attachment to and entry into epithelial cells is a prerequisite for a successful infection of the human host and requires adhesins. Here, we demonstrate that the multidomain protein Epf from S. pyogenes serotype M49 is a streptococcal adhesin. An epf-deficient mutant showed significantly decreased adhesion to and internalization into human keratinocytes. Cell adhesion is mediated by the N-terminal domain of Epf (EpfN) and increased by the human plasma protein plasminogen. The crystal structure of EpfN, solved at 1.6 Å resolution, shows that it consists of two subdomains: a carbohydrate-binding module and a fibronectin type III domain. Both fold types commonly participate in ligand receptor and protein-protein interactions. EpfN is followed by 18 repeats of a domain classified as DUF1542 (domain of unknown function 1542) and a C-terminal cell wall sorting signal. The DUF1542 repeats are not involved in adhesion, but biophysical studies show they are predominantly α-helical and form a fiber-like stalk of tandem DUF1542 domains. Epf thus conforms with the widespread family of adhesins known as MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules), in which a cell wall-attached stalk enables long range interactions via its adhesive N-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W2073300793,"Kar3, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae microtubule minus-end-directed kinesin-14, dimerizes with either Vik1 or Cik1. The C-terminal globular domain of Vik1 exhibits the structure of a kinesin motor domain and binds microtubules independently of Kar3 but lacks a nucleotide binding site. The only known function of Kar3Vik1 is to cross-link parallel microtubules at the spindle poles during mitosis. In contrast, Kar3Cik1 depolymerizes microtubules during mating but cross-links antiparallel microtubules in the spindle overlap zone during mitosis. A recent study showed that Kar3Vik1 binds across adjacent microtubule protofilaments and uses a minus-end-directed powerstroke to drive ATP-dependent motility. The presteady-state experiments presented here extend this study and establish an ATPase model for the powerstroke mechanism. The results incorporated into the model indicate that Kar3Vik1 collides with the microtubule at 2.4 μm(-1) s(-1) through Vik1, promoting microtubule binding by Kar3 followed by ADP release at 14 s(-1). The tight binding of Kar3 to the microtubule destabilizes the Vik1 interaction with the microtubule, positioning Kar3Vik1 for the start of the powerstroke. Rapid ATP binding to Kar3 is associated with rotation of the coiled-coil stalk, and the postpowerstroke ATP hydrolysis at 26 s(-1) is independent of Vik1, providing further evidence that Vik1 rotates with the coiled coil during the powerstroke. Detachment of Kar3Vik1 from the microtubule at 6 s(-1) completes the cycle and allows the motor to return to its initial conformation. The results also reveal key differences in the ATPase cycles of Kar3Vik1 and Kar3Cik1, supporting the fact that these two motors have distinctive biological functions."

This damage tolerance mechanism allows the cell to overcome replication blocks induced by bulky lesions such as UV-induced thymine dimers, facilitating cell survival. However, TLS polymerases are less catalytically efficient than replicative DNA polymerases and have a relatively low fidelity due to an increased size and flexibility of their active sites (11Plosky B.S.

An important DNA lesion that occurs upon exposure to the human carcinogen 1,3-butadiene (BD) is 1,N6-(2-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylpropan-1,3-diyl)-2′-deoxyadenosine (1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA) and its isomer 1,N6-(1-hydroxymethyl-2-hydroxypropan-1,3-diyl)-2′-deoxyadenosine (1,N6-α-HMHP-dA) (Scheme 1) (16Seneviratne U.

BD is an important industrial chemical widely used in the production of synthetic rubber, resins, and polymers, as well as an environmental contaminant present in cigarette smoke, automobile exhaust, and urban air (17Swenberg J.A.

BD is metabolically activated to 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), which can alkylate adenine residues of DNA to give 1,N6-HMHP-dA (16Seneviratne U. Antsypovich S. Goggin M. Dorr D.Q. Guza R. Moser A.

Both isomers of 1,N6-HMHP-dA have been detected in liver, lung, and kidney tissues of laboratory mice exposed to 6.25–625 ppm BD (18Goggin M. Seneviratne U. Swenberg J.A. Walker V.E. Tretyakova N.

Although these lesions are less abundant than guanine monoadducts and guanine-guanine cross-links of DEB, they are persistent in mouse tissues for at least 10 days, suggesting that they may contribute to the biological effects of BD (19Goggin M. Sangaraju D. Walker V.E. Wickliffe J. Swenberg J.A. Tretyakova N. Persistence and repair of bifunctional DNA adducts in tissues of laboratory animals exposed to 1,3-butadiene by inhalation.Chem. Res.

Because both the N6 and the N-1 positions of adenine in 1,N6-HMHP-dA adducts are blocked by the HMHP exocycle, they can no longer be used to form complementary hydrogen bonds with dT. Structurally related 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine (1,N6-ϵdA) adducts are known to adopt the syn conformation about the glycosidic bond, allowing them to mispair with protonated dC in the active site of human DNA polymerase ι (20Nair D.T.

We therefore hypothesized that 1,N6-HMHP-dA adducts can similarly form Hoogsteen base pairs with dG and protonated dA, potentially leading to A→C and A→T transversions, respectively. Such mispairing could explain the mutational spectra observed upon treatment of cells and laboratory animals with BD and DEB (21Cochrane J.E. Skopek T.R.

The main aim of this study was to investigate the ability of human TLS polymerases to carry out DNA synthesis past site-specific (R,S)-1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA lesions. We have determined steady-state kinetic parameters for nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion and identified primer extension products following in vitro replication in the presence of polymerases κ, η, ι, and Dpo4. Our results indicate that hpol κ, hpol η, and Dpo4 are able to bypass (R,S)-1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA lesions and to extend the primer beyond the damaged site by incorporating either correct (T) or incorrect base (A or G) opposite the adduct, along with introducing −1 and −2 frameshift mutations. In contrast, replicative hpol β is completely blocked by the lesion, and hpol ι inserts the correct nucleotide but is unable to extend past the lesion site. Full-length recombinant hpol η, hpol κ, and hpol ι enzymes used for steady-state kinetics experiments were obtained from Enzymax (Lexington, KY). Recombinant human DNA pol κ (amino acids 19–526), recombinant human DNA pol ι (amino acids 1–420), and recombinant human DNA pol η (amino acids 1–437) employed in full-length primer extension and mass spectrometry experiments were expressed and purified as described previously (24Pence M.G.

The 18-mer oligodeoxynucleotide templates containing site- and stereospecific (R,S)-1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA lesions at the 5th position (5′-TCATXGAATCCTTCCCCC-3′) were synthesized by the post-oligomerization methodology developed in our laboratory (27Seneviratne U.

Briefly, 18-mer oligodeoxynucleotides containing site-specific 6-chloropurine at position X were coupled with (R,R)-N-Fmoc-1-amino-2-hydroxy-3,4-epoxybutane to generate the corresponding oligomers containing site- and stereospecific (R,R)-N6-(2-hydroxy-3,4-epoxybut-1-yl) adenine (N6-HEB-dA) adducts. N6-HEB-dA containing oligomers were isolated by HPLC and incubated in water at room temperature to allow the cyclization of (R,R)-N6-HEB-dA to (R,S) 1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA (27Seneviratne U. Antsypovich S.

The corresponding unmodified 18-mer (5′-TCATAGAATCCTTCCCCC-3′) and 13-mer primers (5′-GGGGGAAGGATTC-3′ and 5′-GGGGGAAGGAUTC-3′) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). All DNA strands were purified by HPLC, characterized by HPLC-ESI−-MS/MS, and quantified by UV spectrophotometry. The 13-mer oligodeoxynucleotide primer (5′-GGGGGAAGGATTC-3′) was 5′-end-labeled in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (>6000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase in 50 mm Na-MOPS buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C. Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed by gel filtration through Bio-Spin 6 filters (Bio-Rad). The 32P-end-labeled primer was annealed to an equimolar amount of 18-mer oligodeoxynucleotide templates containing either dA or 1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA (1:1 molar ratio) by heating at 95 °C for 3 min in the presence of 40 mm NaCl, followed by slow cooling overnight. Primer extension assays and steady-state kinetics experiments were conducted for each of the five DNA polymerases (hpol β, hpol η, hpol κ, hpol ι, and Dpo4). The assays were conducted at 37 °C in buffered solutions containing 50 mm Na-MOPS (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol (v/v) with 50 nm radiolabeled primer-template complexes, and 5 nm polymerase enzymes (except for Dpo4, which was used at 25 nm and hpol β, 2 units). The reactions were initiated by the addition of individual nucleotides or a mixture of all four dNTPs and MgCl2 (final concentration, 5 mm). The reactions were stopped after pre-selected time intervals by the addition of 36 μl of stop solution (95% formamide (w/v), 10 mm EDTA, 0.03% bromphenol blue (w/v), 0.03% xylene cyanol (w/v)) to a 4-μl aliquot of the sample. 32P-End-labeled primer-template complexes containing either unmodified dA or 1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA at position X of the template strand were incubated with DNA polymerases as described above in the presence of all four dNTPs (500 μm) for 0–60 min. The reaction products were separated using a 20% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea at a constant voltage (2500 V) for 3 h. The radioactive products were visualized using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). 32P-End-labeled primer-template complexes were incubated with TLS polymerases in the presence of increasing concentrations of individual dNTPs (0–800 μm) for 0–60 min. The resulting oligodeoxynucleotide products were separated by gel electrophoresis as described above and visualized with a phosphorimager. DNA amounts in each band were quantified using Quantity One image software (Bio-Rad), and the steady-state kinetic values were determined by plotting product formation versus dNTP concentration using nonlinear regression analysis (one-site hyperbolic fits in GraphPad Prism). Oligodeoxynucleotide 18-mers (5′-TCATXGAATCCTTCCCCC-3′, where X = dA or (R,S)-1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA) were annealed to the 13-mer primer (5′-GGGGGAAGGAUTC-3′) (100 pmol each) in 20 μl of 50 mm NaCl to form primer-template complexes. The resulting partial duplexes were incubated with individual DNA polymerases (hpol κ, 40 pmol; hpol η, 40 pmol; or Dpo4, 100 pmol) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) buffer containing 5% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 4–6 h. Primer extension reactions were initiated by the addition of all four dNTPs (1 mm each) in a final reaction volume of 75 μl. The reactions were terminated by removing excess dNTPs by size exclusion using a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad). Tris-HCl, DTT, and EDTA were added to the filtrate to restore their concentrations to 50, 5, and 1 mm, respectively. To facilitate MS/MS analyses, oligodeoxynucleotide products were cleaved into smaller fragments by incubation with UDG (6 units, 37 °C for 6 h), followed by heating with 0.25 m piperidine at 95 °C for 1 h (28Christov P.P. Angel K.C. Guengerich F.P. Rizzo C.J. Replication past the N5-methyl-formamidopyrimidine lesion of deoxyguanosine by DNA polymerases and an improved procedure for sequence analysis of in vitro bypass products by mass spectrometry.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2009; 22: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The final solution was dried under vacuum, and the residue was reconstituted in 25 μl of water. The 14-mer oligonucleotide (5′p-CTTCACGAGCCCCC-3′; 40 pmol) was added as an internal standard for mass spectrometry. The injection volume for mass spectrometric analysis was 8 μl. Primer extension products following reactions catalyzed by hpol β (10 units) and hpol ι (80 pmol) were not cleaved with UDG/piperidine because only short extension products were observed that could be directly sequenced by MS/MS. HPLC-ESI−-MS/MS analysis was conducted on an Eksigent HPLC system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA) interfaced to a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The instrument was operated in the negative ion ESI MS/MS mode. Polymerase extension products were separated with an Agilent Zorbax SB 300 C18 (0.5 × 150 mm, 5 μm) column using a gradient of 15 mm ammonium acetate (Buffer A) and acetonitrile (Buffer B). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. The solvent composition was linearly changed from 1 to 10% Buffer B in 18 min, further to 75% B in 2 min, held at 75% B for 3 min, and brought back to 1% B in 2 min and held at 1% B for 10 min. Under these conditions, all DNA oligodeoxynucleotides, including extension products, eluted between 10 and 13 min. Electrospray ionization conditions were as follows: ESI source voltage, 3.5 kV; source current, 6.7 μA; auxiliary gas flow rate setting, 0; sweep gas flow rate setting, 0; sheath gas flow setting, 30; capillary temperature, 275 °C; and S-lens RF level, 50%. The most abundant ions from the ESI−-FTMS spectra were selected and subjected to collision-induced dissociation (CID) analysis using the linear ion trap. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: normalized collision energy, 35%; activation Q, 0.250; activation time, 10 ms; product ion scan range, m/z 300–2000. The amount of each extension product was calculated by comparing peak areas corresponding to each product in extracted ion chromatograms with the peak area of the internal standard. Expected CID fragmentation patterns of oligonucleotides were obtained using the Mongo Oligo mass calculator version 2.06 available from the Mass Spectrometry Group of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Utah. Our initial studies investigated the ability of DNA polymerases to bypass 1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA lesions in the presence of all four dNTPs. 1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA was site-specifically incorporated into an 18-mer template (5′-TCATXGAATCCTTCCCCC-3′, where X = 1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA), which was annealed to a 13-mer primer (5′-GGGGGAAGGATTC-3′). In the resulting duplex (Scheme 2), the primer terminus is positioned immediately prior to the lesion site. The primer-template complexes were subjected to in vitro replication in the presence of hpol β, η, κ, ι, and Dpo4. Control experiments with template containing only native nucleotides (X = dA) confirmed a complete primer extension by hpol β, hpol κ, hpol η, and Dpo4, to form an 18-mer product (left panels in Figs. 1A and 2). In addition, some 19-mer products have also been observed with Dpo4 (Fig. 2C, left panel), which could be attributed to template-independent nucleotide incorporation (blunt end addition) as observed previously (29Fiala K.A.

In contrast, hpol η and hpol κ were able to extend the primer to the terminus, forming the expected 18-mer products (right panels in Fig. 2). The efficiency of primer extension was markedly reduced in the presence of 1,N6-γ-HMHP-dA as compared with unmodified dA, as evident by the presence of incomplete exte"
https://openalex.org/W2104384291,"Disabled-2 (Dab2) targets membranes and triggers a wide range of biological events, including endocytosis and platelet aggregation. Dab2, through its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, inhibits platelet aggregation by competing with fibrinogen for α(IIb)β(3) integrin receptor binding. We have recently shown that the N-terminal region, including the PTB domain (N-PTB), drives Dab2 to the platelet membrane surface by binding to sulfatides through two sulfatide-binding motifs, modulating the extent of platelet aggregation. The three-dimensional structure of a Dab2-derived peptide encompassing the sulfatide-binding motifs has been determined in dodecylphosphocholine micelles using NMR spectroscopy. Dab2 sulfatide-binding motif contains two helices when embedded in micelles, reversibly binds to sulfatides with moderate affinity, lies parallel to the micelle surface, and when added to a platelet mixture, reduces the number and size of sulfatide-induced aggregates. Overall, our findings identify and structurally characterize a minimal region in Dab2 that modulates platelet homotypic interactions, all of which provide the foundation for rational design of a new generation of anti-aggregatory low-molecular mass molecules for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2055061094,"The pathways leading specifically to the toxic Aβ42 peptide production, a key event in Alzheimer's disease (AD), are unknown. While searching for pathways that mediate pathological increases of Aβ42, we identified Aftin-4, a new compound that selectively and potently increases Aβ42 compared to DMSO (N2a cells: 7-fold; primary neurons: 4-fold; brain lysates: 2-fold) with an EC(50) of 30 μM. These results were confirmed by ELISA and IP-WB. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified 3 proteins (VDAC1, prohibitin, and mitofilin) relevant to AD that interact with Aftin-4, but not with a structurally similar but inactive molecule. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated that Aftin-4 induces a reversible mitochondrial phenotype reminiscent of the one observed in AD brains. Sucrose gradient fractionation showed that Aftin-4 perturbs the subcellular localization of γ-secretase components and could, therefore, modify γ-secretase specificity by locally altering its membrane environment. Remarkably, Aftin-4 shares all these properties with two other ""AD accelerator"" compounds. In summary, treatment with three Aβ42 raising agents induced similar biochemical alterations that lead to comparable cellular phenotypes in vitro, suggesting a common mechanism of action involving three structural cellular targets."
https://openalex.org/W1998879888,"Human slow skeletal troponin T (HSSTnT) shares a high degree of homology with cardiac TnT (CTnT). Although the presence of HSSTnT has not been confirmed in the heart at the protein level, detectable levels of HSSTnT mRNA have been found. Whether HSSTnT isoforms are expressed transiently remains unknown. Because transient re-expression of HSSTnT may be a potential mechanism of regulating function, we explored the effect of HSSTnT on the regulation of cardiac muscle. At least three HSSTnT isoforms have been found to exist in slow skeletal muscle: HSSTnT1 (+exons 5 and 12), HSSTnT2 (+exon 5, −exon 12), and HSSTnT3 (−exons 5 and 12). Another isoform, HSSTnT hypothetical (Hyp) (−exon 5, +exon 12), has only been found at the mRNA level. Compared with HCTnT3 (adult isoform), Tn complexes containing HSSTnT1, -2, and -3 did not alter the actomyosin ATPase activation and inhibition in the presence and absence of Ca2+, respectively. HSSTnTHyp was not evaluated as it did not form a Tn complex under a variety of conditions. Porcine papillary skinned fibers displaced with HSSTnT1, -2, or -3 and reconstituted with human cardiac troponin I and troponin C (HCTnI·TnC) complex showed a decrease in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development and an increase in maximal recovered force (HSSTnT1 and -3) compared with HCTnT3. In contrast, HSSTnTHyp showed an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development. This suggests that re- or overexpression of specific SSTnT isoforms might have therapeutic potential in the failing heart because they increase the maximal force of contraction. In addition, circular dichroism and proteolytic digestion experiments revealed structural differences between HSSTnT isoforms and HCTnT3 and that HSSTnT1 is more susceptible to calpain and trypsin proteolysis than the other HSSTnTs. Overall, HSSTnT isoforms despite being homologues of CTnT may display distinct functional properties in muscle regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2041759502,"Differentiation and activation of CD4 memory T cells (Tmem cells) require energy from different sources, but little is known about energy sources for maintenance and surveillance activities of unactivated Tmem cells. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in human unactivated CD4 Tmem cells was significantly enhanced by inhibition of glycolysis, with respective means of 1.7- and 4.5-fold for subjects < 45 yr and > 65 yr, and by stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase, with respective means of 1.3- and 5.2-fold. However, CCL19 and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which control homeostatic lymphoid trafficking of unactivated Tmem cells, altered FAO and glycolysis only minimally or not at all. Inhibition of CD4 Tmem-cell basal FAO, but not basal glycolysis, significantly suppressed CCL19- and S1P-mediated adherence to collagen by >50 and 20%, respectively, and chemotaxis by >20 and 50%. Apoptosis of unactivated Tmem cells induced by IL-2 deprivation or CCL19 was increased significantly by > 150 and 70%, respectively, with inhibition of FAO and by > 110 and 30% with inhibition of glycolysis. Anti-TCR antibody activation of Tmem cells increased their chemotaxis to CCL5, which was dependent predominantly on glycolysis rather than FAO. The sources supplying energy for diverse functions of unactivated Tmem cells differ from that required for function after immune activation.—Taub, D. D., Hesdorffer, C.

https://openalex.org/W2168265909,"Physiological β-amyloid autoantibodies (Aβ-autoantibodies) are currently investigated as potential diagnostic and therapeutic tools for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In previous studies, their determination in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using indirect ELISA has provided controversial results, which may be due to the presence of preformed Aβ antigen-antibody immune complexes. Based on the epitope specificity of the Aβ-autoantibodies, recently elucidated in our laboratory, we developed (a) a sandwich ELISA for the determination of circulating Aβ-IgG immune complexes and (b) an indirect ELISA for the determination of free Aβ-autoantibodies. This methodology was applied to the analysis of serum samples from healthy individuals within the age range of 18 to 89 years. Neuropsychological examination of the participants in this study indicated non-pathological, age-related cognitive decline, revealed especially by tests of visual memory and executive function, as well as speed-related tasks. The ELISA serum determinations showed significantly higher levels of Aβ-IgG immune complexes compared to free Aβ-autoantibodies, while no correlation with age or cognitive performance of the participants was found."
