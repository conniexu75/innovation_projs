https://openalex.org/W2071140879,"The mechanism by which the calcium influx signal, triggered by membrane depolarization, is transduced to the nucleus to activate c-fos proto-oncogene transcription has been characterized. A calcium response element (CaRE) that is indistinguishable from a cAMP response element (CRE) mediates transcriptional inducibility by depolarization. Its cognate transcription factor CREB is the target for both calcium and cAMP signals. CREB is rapidly phosphorylated in response to depolarization or cAMP, at a site known to be important for the transcriptional activating function of this protein. The convergent effects of calcium and cAMP on CREB activation are mediated by distinct protein kinase signaling pathways. CREB and its binding site, the Ca/CRE, can thus function as a regulatory element that integrates both calcium and cAMP signals in the control of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2004403903,"The role of sodium-calcium exchange at the sarcolemma in the release of calcium from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum was investigated in voltage-clamped, isolated cardiac myocytes. In the absence of calcium entry through voltage-dependent calcium channels, membrane depolarization elicited release of calcium from ryanodine-sensitive internal stores. This process was dependent on sodium entry through tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels. Calcium release under these conditions was also dependent on extracellular calcium concentration, suggesting a calcium-induced trigger release mechanism that involves calcium entry into the cell by sodium-calcium exchange. This sodium current-induced calcium release mechanism may explain, in part, the positive inotropic effects of cardiac glycosides and the negative inotropic effects of a variety of antiarrhythmic drugs that interact with cardiac sodium channels. In response to a transient rise of intracellular sodium, sodium-calcium exchange may promote calcium entry into cardiac cells and trigger sarcoplasmic calcium release during physiologic action potentials."

https://openalex.org/W1988579556,"We have identified a gene, SRV2, mutations of which alleviate stress sensitivity in strains carrying an activated RAS gene. Epistasis analysis suggests that the gene affects accumulation of cAMP in the cell. Direct assays of cAMP accumulation indicate that mutations of the gene diminish the rate of in vivo production of cAMP following stimulation by an activated RAS allele. Null mutations of srv2 result in lethality, which cannot be suppressed by mutational activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The sequence of the gene indicates that it encodes an adenylate cyclase-associated protein. These results demonstrate that SRV2 protein is required for RAS-activated adenylate cyclase activity, but that it participates in other essential cellular functions as well."
https://openalex.org/W2006036490,"Ventricular myocytes exhibit a nifedipine-sensitive inward calcium current (ICa) and contracture when they are voltage clamped from -40 to 0 millivolt in the presence of caffeine and in the absence of extracellular sodium. However, upon repolarization they fail to relax because neither the sarcoplasmic reticulum nor the sodium-calcium exchange can reduce intracellular calcium. Sudden application of extracellular sodium during the contracture (but after repolarization) causes immediate relaxation and activates a transient inward sodium-calcium exchange current (INa-Ca), whose peak slightly precedes mechanical relaxation. The total charge carried by the nifedipine-sensitive ICa is twice the total charge carried by the transient inward INa-Ca. Assuming an exchange stoichiometry of three sodium to one calcium, these results indicate that all the calcium entering the cell during the initial depolarization is extruded by the sodium-calcium exchange."

The activities of tailless (tll) and the newly identified gap gene huckebein (hkb) are specifically involved in mediating the maternal terminal information at the posterior end of the blastoderm embryo."

Chem. 259, 7155-7162) reported activation of a K+ pumping mode of (Na,K)-ATPase by an oscillating electric field (20 V/cm, 1.0 kHz). Their attempts to activate Na+ pumping at the same frequency were unsuccessful. We report here activation of a Na+ pumping mode with an oscillating electric field of the same strength as used previously (20 V/cm) but at a much higher frequency (1.0 MHz). At 3.5 degrees C and the optimal amplitude and frequency, the field-induced, ouabain-sensitive (0.2 mM ouabain incubated for 30 min) Rb+ influx ranged between 10 and 20 amol/red blood cell/h, and the corresponding Na+ efflux ranged between 15 and 30 amol/red blood cell/h, varying with the source of the erythrocytes. No Rb+ efflux nor Na+ influx was stimulated by the applied field in the frequency range 1 Hz to 10 MHz. These results indicate that only those transport modes that require ATP splitting under the physiological condition were affected by the applied electric fields, although the field-stimulated Rb+ influx and Na+ efflux did not depend on the cellular ATP concentration in the range 5 to 800 microM. Computer simulation of a four-state enzyme electroconformationally coupled to an alternating electric field (Tsong, T. Y., and Astumian, R. D. (1986) Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 15, 457-476; Tsong, T. Y. (1990) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 19, 83-106) reproduced the main features of the above results."
https://openalex.org/W1497407086,"To investigate the function of heavy chain binding protein (BiP, GRP 78) in the endoplasmic reticulum, we have characterized its interaction with a model plasma membrane glycoprotein, the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus. We used a panel of well characterized mutant G proteins and immunoprecipitation with anti-BiP antibodies to determine if BiP interacted with newly synthesized G protein and/or mutant G proteins retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. We made three major observations: 1) BiP bound transiently to folding intermediates of wild-type G protein which were incompletely disulfide-bonded; 2) BiP did not bind stably to all mutant G proteins which remain in the endoplasmic reticulum; and 3) BiP bound stably only to mutant G proteins which do not form correct intrachain disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1491240105,"The free radical-generating enzyme xanthine oxidase has been hypothesized to be a central mechanism of the injury which occurs in postischemic tissues; however, its importance remains controversial. Much attention has focused on the role of this enzyme in myocardial reperfusion injury. While xanthine oxidase has been observed in ischemic tissue homogenates, the presence and importance of radical generation by the enzyme in intact tissues are unknown. Therefore, we performed electron paramagnetic resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance and hemodynamic studies to measure the presence and significance of xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation in the isolated rat heart. When isolated perfused rat hearts were reperfused after 30 min of global ischemia, myocardial function and coronary flow were significantly improved in the presence of the definitive xanthine oxidase blocker oxypurinol. Free radical concentrations measured by spin-trapping with 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide were significantly decreased by oxypurinol and the energetic state of the heart was improved as reflected by an increased recovery of phosphocreatine and a higher phosphocreatine/Pi ratio. ATP recovery, however, was not altered, indicating that the improved functional and metabolic state of the heart was not due to ATP salvage. Spectrophotometric assays for the enzyme showed an increase in the amount of xanthine oxidase relative to dehydrogenase following ischemia, and a total available xanthine oxidase pool in the rat heart of approximately 150 milliunits/g of protein. Thus, xanthine oxidase is a significant source of the oxidative injury which occurs upon reperfusion of the ischemic rat heart."
https://openalex.org/W1517936476,"It has recently been shown that replacement of the border residues (Gln-111 and Asn-122) of the H1-H2 extracellular domain of the sheep Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit with the charged amino acids Arg and Asp generates a ouabain-resistant enzyme (Price, E. M. and Lingrel, J. B. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8400-8408). In order to further study structure-function relationships in Na,K-ATPase, six additional mutations have been made at these border positions. Two of these mutants were single amino acid substitutions (Gln-111 to Arg or Asn-122 to Asp). These mutations change one or the other H1-H2 border residue to a charged amino acid. The remaining substitutions were double mutants in which both of the H1-H2 border residues were simultaneously changed to charged amino acids. Changes were made which introduced either positively charged amino acids (Lys at positions 111 and 122), negatively charged amino acids (Glu at positions 111 and 122) or oppositely charged amino acids (Lys at position 111 and Glu at 122; Asp at position 111 and Arg at 122) at the borders of the H1-H2 extracellular domain. HeLa cells transfected with any of these sheep Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit mutants were able to grow in concentrations of ouabain that were toxic to untransfected cells or cells transfected with the wild type sheep alpha subunit. Crude membranes isolated from the transfectants were analyzed for ouabain inhibitable Na,K-ATPase activity. All of the transfectants contained a relatively ouabain-resistant component of enzyme activity, with the ouabain I50 values ranging from 4 x 10(-3) M to 1 x 10(-6) M. The most resistant enzyme was the double mutant that contained Asp at position 111 and Arg at 122, whereas the least resistant were the enzymes containing the single amino acid substitutions. There was no correlation between the type of charged amino acid present at the border position and the degree of ouabain resistance. These data demonstrate the functional importance, in terms of ouabain binding, of the border positions of the H1-H2 extracellular domain of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1587723748,"ras p21 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) has been proposed to interact with the putative effector domain of ras p21s, and smg p21, a ras p21-like guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), has been shown to have the same amino acid sequence as ras p21s in this region. In the present studies, we examined the effects of ras p21 GAP on the GTPase activity of smg p21 purified from human platelets, of smg p21 on the ras p21 GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of c-Ha-ras p21 purified from Escherichia coli, and of c-Ha-ras p21 on the smg p21 GAP1- or -2-stimulated GTPase activity of smg p21. ras p21 GAP stimulated the GTPase activity of c-Ha-ras p21 but not that of smg p21. The GTP-bound form of smg p21, however, inhibited the ras p21 GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of c-Ha-ras p21 in a dose-dependent manner. The half-maximum inhibition by smg p21 was obtained at 0.4 microM which was more potent than previously observed for ras p21 (2-200 microM). The GDP-bound form also inhibited the ras p21 GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of c-Ha-ras p21, but the efficiency was 40-50% that of the GTP-bound form. smg p21 GAP1 and -2 stimulated the GTPase activity of smg p21 but not that of c-Ha-ras p21. c-Ha-ras p21 did not inhibit the smg p21 GAP1- or -2-stimulated GTPase activity of smg p21. These results indicate that ras p21 GAP interacts with smg p21 without the subsequent stimulation of its GTPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1566080476,"An exo-beta-(1----3)-D-galactanase from Driselase, a commercial enzyme preparation from Irpex lacteus (Polyporus tulipiferae) has been purified 166-fold. Apparent molecular weights of the purified enzyme, estimated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, were found to be 51,000 and 42,000, respectively. It hydrolyzed specifically oligosaccharides and polymers of (1----3)-linked beta-D-galactopyranosyl residues, and exhibited a maximal activity toward these substrates at pH 4.6. Based on the mode of the liberation of D-galactose from beta-(1----3)-D-galactan and the methyl beta-glycoside of beta-(1----3)-D-galactopentaose, the enzyme can be classified as an exo-glycanase capable of catalyzing the sequential hydrolytic release of single D-galactosyl residues from the nonreducing termini. The extent of the hydrolysis of the carbohydrate portion of acacia gum and radish arabinogalactan-proteins increased with their decreasing branching. Isolation and characterization of the major products formed from the proteoglycans indicated the action pattern of the enzyme to include the capability of bypassing the branching points. Consequently, the side chains carrying an additional D-galactosyl group at the reducing termini are released as neutral (1----6)-linked beta-D-galactooligosaccharides and their acidic derivatives having a 4-O-methyl-beta-D-glucuronosyl residue as the nonreducing end-group. The specificity and the mode of action showed the enzyme to be a useful tool for analyzing the fine structure of type II arabinogalactans and arabinogalactan-protein conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W1527362740,"Biological tyrosine phosphorylation has become an extensively studied reaction. Little, however, is known of the chemistry involved. The acetylation of the tyrosyl phenolic hydroxyl group by N-acetylimidazole was studied as a model acylation reaction over the pH range 7.5-9.5. The reactivities of tyrosine and 3-fluorotyrosine were compared. The ratio of reactivities, kappa F-Tyr/kappa Tyr, decreases with increasing pH. Extrapolation to the state in which equivalent concentrations of the two derivatives exist indicates that, consistent with Bronsted theory, tyrosine is 17 times more reactive than fluorotyrosine. No reactivity was observed with tetrafluorotyrosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, or 3,5-dinitrotyrosine. A peptide containing fluorotyrosine was synthesized and compared with the tyrosine-containing peptide as a substrate for the insulin receptor/tyrosine kinase. In both the presence and absence of insulin, the tyrosine peptide was phosphorylated with higher Vm and Km values than the fluorotyrosine peptide was. These results suggest that ionization of the tyrosyl hydroxyl group has an effect on both the chemical and enzymatic reactivities of the tyrosyl residue in acylation reactions. A model is suggested in which deprotonation of the acceptor occurs upon binding of the substrate to the kinase and implicates a role for the substrate site microenvironment in defining substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1980991323,"A reversible block to RNA polymerase II transcriptional elongation has been created with a lac operator sequence in the intron of the SV40 large T-antigen gene. When this transcription unit is injected into rabbit kidney cells expressing Escherichia coli lac repressor, T-antigen expression is reduced. This effect is not observed in cells lacking repressor or in the absence of the operator, and it is reversed by an inducer of the lac operon, namely isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG). In an extract of HeLa nuclei supplemented with lac repressor, this and similar constructs give rise to shortened transcripts that map to the 5' boundary of the repressor-operator complex. These shorter RNAs are also sensitive to IPTG induction. This model system shows that a protein-DNA complex can block the passage of RNA polymerase II, and offers some insight into the control of eukaryotic gene expression during transcription elongation, a phenomenon observed in a variety of systems."
https://openalex.org/W1596051929,"Endothelin-1 is a powerful inotropic peptide for the rat atrium. Its action can develop in the absence of L-type Ca2+ channel activity provided that the external Ca2(+)-concentration has been raised to supraphysiological concentrations. Endothelin stimulates phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in new born rat atrial cells via a mechanism that is insensitive to pertussis toxin. The diacylglycerol/protein kinase C signaling pathway cannot account for the contractile action of endothelin but its activation by phorbol esters induces a partial desensitization of phospholipase C activity. Endothelin-1 and the related peptides, endothelin-2, endothelin-3, and sarafotoxin S6b, raise intracellular Ca2+ levels in rat atrial cells. The actions of endothelin-1, endothelin-2, and sarafotoxin on [Ca2+]i are mutually exclusive, suggesting that they act at the same receptor site. The rise in [Ca2+]i induced by endothelins results both from the mobilization of intracellular stores and from Ca2+ entry through the sarcolemma via a pathway that is not voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels. The Ca2+ store that is mobilized in response to endothelin retains its Ca2+ content when cells were incubated for long periods of time in a 50 nM Ca2+ solution. It is insensitive to caffeine and ryanodine. These two properties distinguish it from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Contraction experiments in which the pacing rate has been altered to favor Ca2+ accumulation into terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum also suggest that the Ca2+ load of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is increased in endothelin treated rat atria."
https://openalex.org/W1523851596,"The regulation of purified yeast membrane-associated phosphatidylserine synthase (CDP-diacylglycerol:L-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.8) and phosphatidylinositol synthase (CDP-diacylglycerol:myo-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.11) activities by phospholipids was examined using Triton X-100/phospholipid mixed micelles. Phosphatidate, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol stimulated phosphatidylserine synthase activity, whereas cardiolipin and the neutral lipid diacylglycerol inhibited enzyme activity. Phosphatidate was a potent activator of phosphatidylserine synthase activity with an apparent activation constant (0.033 mol %) 88-fold lower than the apparent Km (2.9 mol %) for the surface concentration of CDP-diacylglycerol. Phosphatidate caused an increase in the apparent Vmax and a decrease in the apparent Km for the enzyme with respect to the surface concentration of CDP-diacylglycerol. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol caused an increase in the apparent Vmax for phosphatidylserine synthase with respect to CDP-diacylglycerol with apparent activation constants of 3.4 and 3.2 mol %, respectively. Cardiolipin and diacylglycerol were competitive inhibitors of phosphatidylserine synthase activity with respect to CDP-diacylglycerol. The apparent Ki value for cardiolipin (0.7 mol %) was 4-fold lower than the apparent Km for CDP-diacylglycerol, whereas the apparent Ki for diacylglycerol (7 mol %) was 2.4-fold higher than the apparent Km for CDP-diacylglycerol. Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol did not affect phosphatidylserine synthase activity. Phosphatidylinositol synthase activity was not significantly effected by lipids. The role of lipid activators and inhibitors on phosphatidylserine synthase activity is discussed in relation to overall lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1495335339,"Activated neutrophils cause extensive DNA damage in neighboring nonphagocytic cells. To determine whether compounds in the extracellular milieu participate in the DNA damage process, murine neutrophils were cocultivated with target tumor cells in media of varying composition. Using the alkaline elution assay, it was found that the level of strand breaks induced was significantly higher (2.8-fold) in complex cell culture media than in minimal phosphate-buffered saline. Addition of amino acids in general and of histidine in particular increased the level of damage nearly to that observed in complete media (2.7- and 2.1-fold, respectively). The histidine stimulation was concentration-dependent and reached a maximum at 100-400 microM. The mechanism whereby this occurred is not proven but probably derived from chelation of metals and participation in a site-specific Fenton reaction. Addition of the cell-impermeable chelator EDTA dramatically inhibited induction of strand breaks by neutrophils in complete media and prevented the enhancement of damage induced by histidine in phosphate-buffered saline. None of the effects on neutrophil-induced damage could be attributed to modulation of the oxidative burst activity of the cells (O2- and H2O2 production). Histidine also enhanced induction of strand breaks by reagent H2O2. However, EDTA had no effect or actually increased the level of damage induced by both a bolus of H2O2 and a flux of H2O2 generated by glucose oxidase. The cell-permeable chelator o-phenanthroline inhibited both neutrophil- and H2O2-induced damage. The results indicate that secondary reactions involving extracellular amino acids and metals contribute significantly to neutrophil-induced DNA damage to neighboring cells. Moreover, the data show that the mechanism whereby neutrophils induce this damage cannot be attributed solely to secretion of H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W1656430293,"Capping of reovirus mRNAs is catalyzed by a guanylyltransferase that corresponds to virion structural polypeptide lambda 2. It forms a phosphoamide linked enzyme-pG covalent complex as an intermediate in the capping reaction. The nucleotide attachment site on lambda 2 was localized to a region between amino acids 213 and 269 by incubating virus particles with [alpha-32P]GTP followed by proteolytic cleavage and analysis of the resulting fragments using sequence-directed antibodies as probes. The 213-269 region contains as potential GMP acceptors a single lysine, 1 arginine, and 4 histidine residues, as deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the L2 gene encoding lambda 2. Digestion of 32P-labeled capping intermediate with alkali after oxidation and beta-elimination yielded phospholysine as the only phosphoamino acid, localizing the active site to a region in lambda 2 that includes the lysine at position 226."
https://openalex.org/W2157365011,"Since calcium is involved in both excitation-secretion and excitation-contraction coupling, it was of interest to evaluate its involvement in atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) release from atrial cardiocytes. In medium containing physiological levels of calcium (1.4 mM), the secretion of ANF from primary atrial cells was stimulated from 3- to 6-fold by a variety of agents including KCl, phenylephrine, and endothelium (ET). However, in medium containing 2 nM calcium, KCl was incapable of increasing ANF secretion above basal levels, while the stimulatory effects of phenylephrine and ET were only partially diminished. Nifedipine or verapamil could mimic the effects of the 2 nM calcium medium on KCl-, phenylephrine-, and ET-stimulated ANF secretion. Kinetic studies indicated that during the initial 5 min of ET-stimulated secretion the cells exhibited little requirement for extracellular calcium; however, the requirement was more apparent during the sustained secretion observed between 10 min and 2 h of secretagogue exposure. Additionally, the stimulation of ANF secretion by ET increased to a maximum of about 15-fold over basal by 10-min after ET application; subsequent to this time there was an apparent functional desensitization wherein the rate of secretion decreased by approximately 3-4-fold and remained at this level for the duration of secretagogue exposure up to 2 h. All forms of stimulated secretion could be inhibited through ionomycin-mediated depletion of intracellular calcium pools. Taken together, these results indicate that atrial cardiocytes require both extracellular and intracellular calcium to support maximal rates of stimulated ANF secretion, and that intracellular calcium pools may be used during the early phase of secretion, while the extracellular source of calcium may be important for the sustained phase of secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1502496537,"The 5'(3')-nucleotidase earlier partially purified from rat liver by Fritzson and Smith [1971) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 235, 128-141) was purified 15,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from human placenta. The soluble enzyme is a homodimer with a native molecular mass of 44-45 kDa. It has a pH optimum between 6.0 and 6.5 and is absolutely dependent on Mg2+ ions. The enzyme dephosphorylates certain 2'-, 3'-, and 5'-nucleotides. Km values for 2'- and 3'-nucleotides are around 0.3 mM with no preference for either ribo- or deoxyribonucleotides. 5'-Deoxyribonucleotides are 10-fold better substrates than the corresponding ribonucleotides, with dIMP greater than dUMP greater than dGMP greater than dTMP. dAMP is a poor substrate, dCMP is essentially insert. In all cases the Km values are in the millimolar range. Of the different forms of nucleotidases characterized in animal cells, the 5'(3')-nucleotidase is unique in its preference for 5'-deoxyribonucleotides. In intact cells, a portion of de novo synthesized deoxyribonucleotides is degraded as part of a homeostatic mechanism regulating the size of deoxyribonucleotide pools. This requires the participation of one or several 5'-nucleotidases. The 5'(3')-nucleotidase may be one such enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1571955681,"The low-spin, cyanide-ligated ferric complex of the intact bovine granulocyte myeloperoxidase (MPO-CN) has been studied by proton nuclear magnetic resonance utilizing the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE). This is the largest globular protein (approximately 1.5 x 10(5) for the intact alpha 2 beta 2 tetrameric species) for which successful NOEs have been observed without serious interference of spin diffusion, and demonstrably confirms the utility of such studies on large paramagnetic as compared to diamagnetic proteins. The 1H NMR spectrum of MPO-CN is found to have a remarkable similarity in the number, resonance pattern, and metal ion-induced relaxation properties of the resolved, hyperfine-shifted resonances to those reported earlier for the analogous complex of bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO-CN); moreover, the interproton connectivities between pairs of hyperfine-shifted proton sets, as reflected by the NOEs, are also essentially the same (Thanabal, V., and La Mar, G. N. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 7038-7044). Since the extracted prosthetic group of lactoperoxidase is a porphyrin with proposed functionalization of the 8-methylene group (Nichol, A. W., Angel, L. A., Moon, T., and Clezy, P. S. (1987) Biochem. J. 247, 147-150), we interpret the resultant similarity in 1H NMR spectral parameters for LPO-CN and MPO-CN as indicating that the prosthetic groups in MPO and LPO are very similar, and hence likely both porphyrins with a similarly functionalized periphery that allows covalent linkage to the protein matrix. The hyperfine shift pattern of the broadest resolved lines lead to their assignment to the axial histidyl imidazole side chain. Two pairs of resonances are found to have similar relaxation properties and/or dipolar as similarly shifted resonances that arise from a distal His and Arg in horseradish peroxidase (as also found in LPO-CN), and suggest that MPO also possesses these catalytically functional residues in the distal heme pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1545529386,"In the erythrocyte, a membrane-bound serine/threonine protein kinase (a casein kinase) has been shown to phosphorylate a number of membrane proteins, modulating their function. Here we report that the membrane-bound protein kinase binds to membranes by an association with a minor membrane component contained in preparations of glycophorin (possibly a minor glycophorin). The binding of the kinase to glycophorins does not significantly modify kinase activity. However, upon binding, the kinase activity is potently inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and the affinity of the kinase for the glycophorins is increased. Other phospholipids or polyanions such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate do not affect protein kinase activity when the kinase is bound to membranes but do inhibit the solubilized membrane-bound kinase. In the erythrocyte, there is a cytosolic form of the casein kinase which is very similar, having the same molecular weight and substrate specificity as the membrane-bound casein kinase. The cytosolic casein kinase is inhibited by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate but much less so by glycophorin preparations containing phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. When the sequences of both casein kinases were compared by two-dimensional peptide mapping, it was found that the two kinases were very similar but not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1485079524,"The role of protein kinase C in activation of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger was studied in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. The basic lipid, sphingosine, was used to block enzymatic activity of protein kinase C. Na+/H+ exchange was activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), diacylglycerols, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), thrombin, or by osmotically-induced cell shrinkage. Intracellular pH and Na+/H+ exchange activity were measured using the intracellular pH indicator, 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6) carboxyfluorescein. Acting alone, both crude sphingosine and pure, synthetic C18 D-(+)-erythro-sphingosine raised pHi in a dose-dependent manner (from 6.95 +/- 0.02 to 7.19 +/- 0.09 over 10 min for 10 microM sphingosine). This alkalinization was not due to Na+/H+ exchange as it was not altered by t-butylamiloride (50 microM) nor by replacement of the assay medium with a Na(+)-free solution. Sphingosine-induced alkalinization did not require protein kinase C activity, since it was fully intact in protein kinase C-depleted cells. It was also not due to a detergent action of sphingosine on the cell membrane, since both ionic and non-ionic detergents caused cell acidification. Rather, alkalinization induced by sphingosine appeared to be due to cellular uptake of NH3 groups since N-acetylsphingosine showed no alkalinization. After the initial cell alkalinization, cellular uptake of [3H]sphingosine continued slowly for up to 24 h. The ability of PMA or dioctanoylglycerol to activate Na+/H+ exchange fell to 20% of control after 24 h of sphingosine exposure. At all times, C11 and N-acetylsphingosine failed to block PMA-induced activation of the exchanger. Activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger by sucrose, which does not depend on protein kinase C activity, was unaffected by sphingosine. Activation of Na+/H+ exchange by thrombin and PDGF was partially inhibited by 30 and 20%, respectively. These data indicate that both thrombin and PDGF activate Na+/H+ exchange by pathway(s) that are primarily independent of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1597229060,"The interaction of Mg2+, AMP, and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate with respect to rabbit liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was investigated by studying initial-rate kinetics of the system at pH 9.5. A rapid-equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism is suggested for the rabbit liver enzyme from the kinetic data. Our kinetic findings indicate that Mg2+ and the inhibitor AMP are mutually exclusive in their binding to fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. This probably is the mechanism for AMP regulation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and thus, to some extent, gluconeogenesis. A kinetic model for the interaction of these ligands with respect to rabbit liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1572372318,"GM1 (II3Neu5Ac-GgOse4Cer)-oligosaccharide was prepared from the ganglioside by ozonolysis and alkaline fragmentation, reductively aminated and coupled to the heterobifunctional cross-linker succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate. The resulting derivative reacted with free sulfhydryl groups and readily cross-linked to cell surface components on rat glioma C6 cells which are GM1-deficient. Attachment of the GM1-oligosaccharide derivative, which was monitored by increased binding of 125I-cholera toxin to the cells, was both time- and concentration-dependent. Prior treatment of the cells with dithiothreitol enhanced the attachment by generating additional free sulfhydryl groups. The affinity of cholera toxin for cells treated with the GM1-oligosaccharide derivative or with GM1 was similar. The nature of the newly generated toxin receptors was determined by Western blotting. Membranes from derivatized cells were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the resolved components were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet which was overlain with 125I-cholera toxin. The toxin bound to a wide variety of membrane proteins, most of which were trypsin-sensitive. No such binding was observed using membranes from control cells. Although the GM1-neoganglioproteins newly generated on the surface of rat glioma C6 cells readily bound cholera toxin, the cells did not become more responsive to the toxin as measured by increased production of cyclic AMP or activation of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, cells exposed to GM1 became highly responsive to the toxin. Thus, neoganglioproteins on the cell surface appear to behave as nonfunctional receptors for cholera toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1771300920,"We have isolated two overlapping clones covering the entire length of the gene of nuclear-encoded sub-unit IV of cytochrome c oxidase (COXIV) from a rat genomic library in Charon 4A and determined the structural organization of the gene. The gene spans approximately 7.0 kilobases and contains five exons interrupted by four introns. Of these exons, exon 2 codes for a whole length of the presequence of the rat COXIV precursor protein, while exons 3 to 5 encode three distinct structural domains of the mature protein. The 5'-flanking region of the gene lacks conventional TATA and CAAT boxes, but has a high G + C content and contains two putative binding sites for transcription factor SP1 and a sequence resembling the AP-4 responsive element. These results indicate that the promoter region of the rat COXIV gene possesses characteristic features common in housekeeping genes. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay performed by constructing an improved phagemid, pBlueCAT3, revealed that a 773-base pair DNA fragment immediately preceding the cap site has a strong promoter activity. An octanucleotide sequence, -TTCTTGGT-, which is very close to the yeast HAP2/HAP3 responsive element, is located in the 5'-upstream region of the present gene."
https://openalex.org/W1607368411,"The effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were examined in a murine macrophage cell line (BAC1.2F5) that was completely dependent on colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) for both growth and survival. The addition of PGE2 to cultures of BAC1.2F5 cells resulted in the inhibition of CSF-1-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell proliferation. The inhibitory effects of PGE2 were mimicked by the addition of dibutyryl-cyclic AMP, and the effectiveness of PGE2 was markedly potentiated by 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, a potent inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity. PGE2 caused a 10-fold elevation of the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration, whereas CSF-1 neither increased cyclic AMP levels nor attenuated the rise in cyclic AMP promoted by PGE2. However, CSF-1 may indirectly regulate cyclic AMP levels since in the absence of CSF-1, BAC1.2F5 cells actively synthesized PGE2, whereas PGE2 production was abruptly terminated by the addition of CSF-1. In BAC1.2F5 cells, PGE2 increases the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration, thereby blocking cell proliferation, but does not down-regulate the CSF-1 receptor or abrogate the functions of CSF-1 necessary for cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W1675724274,"Several species of protozoan parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae have a surface membrane-associated enzyme which is capable of hydrolyzing extracellular 3'-nucleotides and nucleic acids, thereby aiding in the acquisition of nutritionally required purines and Pi from their hosts. In Crithidia luciliae, this 3'-nucleotidase/nuclease previously has been shown to be highly regulated as purine and/or Pi starvation of this trypanosomatid leads to as much as a 1000-fold increase in enzyme activity. We have purified the enzyme to apparent homogeneity from detergent extracts of purine-starved C. luciliae by heparin-agarose chromatography followed by Mono Q and Mono S fast protein liquid chromatography. The enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 43,000 and a pI of approximately 5.8. The enzyme displayed broad pH optima, with peaks at 8.0, for both nucleotidase and nuclease activities. The pH optima shifted to lower values when the activity was assayed in the presence of sulfhydryl reagents. The enzyme was most active with 3'-AMP and poly(A) in nucleotidase and nuclease assays, respectively. As a nuclease the enzyme hydrolyzed RNA at a faster rate than single-stranded DNA with no detectable hydrolysis of double-stranded DNA. The loss of enzyme activity which occurred upon storage at acid pH was prevented by the inclusion of Zn2+ in storage buffers. The physicochemical and kinetic properties of this trypanosomatid enzyme suggest that it is similar to the class I nucleases found in fungi and in germinating seedlings of higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1532935211,"Photoaffinity labeling of calcineurin by 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-N-(4-azido-3-[125I]iodo-2- hydroxybenzoyl)ethanolamine resulted in preferential labeling of its regulatory B subunit. Photolabeling of B was greatly enhanced by Ca2+ which further supports the hypothesis that the phospholipid-binding site of calcineurin is located on this Ca2(+)-binding subunit. Extending the time of incubation of calcineurin with the photoprobe prior to photolysis also elevated labeling of the B subunit, probably as a result of time-dependent changes in protein conformation. Support for these conformational changes was obtained when time-dependent preincubation of calcineurin with acidic phospholipids enhanced subsequent tryptic degradation of its B subunit. Activity measurements and analyses of the reversibility of phospholipid-binding provided evidence for a two-stage mechanism of calcineurin-phospholipid interactions. Initial binding of calcineurin to phospholipids is rapid, Ca2(+)-sensitive, reversible, and leads to stimulation of the phosphatase toward a number of its substrates. A subsequent slow phase strengthens the association and appears to correlate with the phospholipid-promoted conformational change of the B subunit; the corresponding time-dependent effects on enzymatic activity are, again, substrate-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1594245582,"A radiolabeled photoaffinity ligand has been developed for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-preferring excitatory amino acid receptor complex. [3H]3-Azido-(5S, 10R)(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H- dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine [3H]3-azido-MK-801 demonstrated nearly identical affinity, density of binding sites, selectivity, pH sensitivity, and pharmacological profile in reversible binding assays with guinea pig brain homogenates to those displayed by its parent compound, MK-801. When employed in a photo-labeling protocol designed to optimize specific incorporation, [3H]3-azido-MK-801 labeled a single protein band which migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with Mr = 120,000. Incorporation of tritium into this band was completely inhibited when homogenates and [3H]3-azido-MK-801 were coincubated with 10 microM phencyclidine. These data suggest that the phencyclidine site of the NMDA receptor complex is at least in part comprised of a Mr = 120,000 polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1542171218,"Poliovirus infection of HeLa cells results in cleavage of the p220 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-4F and inhibits cap-dependent initiation of protein synthesis. To examine the effect of virus-induced inhibition on the structure of initiation factor complexes involved in cap binding, the polypeptide compositions of cap affinity-purified complexes from uninfected and poliovirus-infected HeLa cells were analyzed. Monoclonal antibodies directed against p220 and an eIF-3 subunit, p170, were utilized to locate eIF-3 and eIF-4F on sucrose gradients and in fractions eluting from cap analog columns. This approach resulted in the purification of several different cap-binding complexes from different cellular subfractions and revealed significant differences in their composition after infection. The results indicate that eIF-3 and eIF-4F bind to the cap structure, possibly in the form of a complex, and that a modified form of eIF-3 alone has some cap-binding activity in the complete absence of p220, eIF-4A, and eIF-4E. Ribosome-derived complexes containing cleaved p220 are no longer associated with eIF-3 or eIF-4A, and a significant amount of cleaved p220 is associated with a unique cytoplasmic cap-binding complex. The cytoplasmic complex also contains Mr = 170,000 and 80,000 polypeptides, neither of which are major components of eIF-4F. These results demonstrate significant variation in the composition of cap-binding complexes from both infected and uninfected cells. They indicate that eIF-3 might play a direct role in cap binding and suggest that poliovirus-induced cleavage of p220 results in the release of the eIF-4A subunit from eIF-4F and abolishes an association between eIF-4F and eIF-3 which may function during the multifactor steps involved in initiation of cap-mediated translation."
https://openalex.org/W1591464913,"Mutation of Pro82 into Thr, a residue situated in the second element (D80CPG83) of the consensus sequence proposed to interact with GTP/GDP in GTP-binding proteins was introduced via site-directed mutagenesis in the isolated guanine nucleotide-binding domain (G domain) of elongation factor Tu. G domainPT82 displays virtually no GTPase activity. As a major change, the apparent inhibition of the GTPase reaction is associated with the appearance of autophosphorylating activity, as in ras product p21 in the case of mutation Ala59----Thr, corresponding to 82 in elongation factor Tu. Dependence of this reaction on mono- and divalent cation concentration and on pH is essentially the same as for the GTPase of wild-type G domain. The autokinase reaction follows an apparent first order rate, suggesting an intermolecular mechanism. Analysis of amino acid and peptide composition of the 32P-labeled G domainPT82, as well as Edman degradation of the tryptic peptide containing the covalently bound 32P, shows that Thr82 is the phosphorylated residue. Taken together, these results point out that Thr82 is in close proximity to the gamma-phosphate of GTP, as in the case of Thr59 in p21. These results are in agreement with the observations derived from x-ray diffraction analysis that the tertiary structure of the GTP-binding domain of elongation factor Tu and that of p21 are similar."
https://openalex.org/W1513276314,"Using a transcription system derived from rat liver, we have investigated the function of the TATA-box and cap site/initiator regions in assembly of stable intermediates on the pathway leading to formation of a functional RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. Our findings argue that neither the TATA-box region nor the cap site/initiator region functions independently in the binding of transcription factors during formation of these intermediates, but, rather, the two sequence elements function cooperatively to direct assembly of a stable preinitiation complex at the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1514045768,"Iron binding to transferrin and lactoferrin requires a synergistic anion, which is carbonate in vivo. The anion is thought to play a key role in iron binding and release. To understand better the iron-carbonate interaction, experiments were performed with iron(III) and copper(II) complexes of human milk lactoferrin and serum transferrin with carbon-13-labeled carbonate. Modulation frequencies were present in the Fourier transforms of two-pulse and three-pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation data for the Fe(III) and Cu(II) complexes, consistent with binding of carbonate to both metals. The metal-13C interaction was similar for the lactoferrin and transferrin complexes. Spin coupling to the nitrogen of a coordinated histidine imidazole was observed for both metals. Both the metal-nitrogen and the metal-carbon spin coupling constants were about a factor of 5 smaller for the iron complexes than for the copper complexes, which indicated substantial similarity in the metal-carbonate and metal-imidazole binding for the two metals."
https://openalex.org/W1620114700,"Oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP) is a water-soluble subunit of bovine heart mitochondrial H(+)-ATPase (F1-F0). In order to investigate the requirement of OSCP for passive proton conductance through mitochondrial F0, OSCP-depleted membrane preparations were obtained by extracting purified F1-F0 complexes with 4.0 M urea. The residual complexes, referred to as UF0, were found to be deficient with respect to OSCP, as well as alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of F1-ATPase, but had a full complement of coupling factor 6 as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting techniques. These UF0 complexes had no intrinsic ATPase activity and were able to bind nearly the same amount of F1-ATPase in the presence of either OSCP or NH4+ ions alone, or a combination of the two. However, the preparations exhibited an absolute dependency on OSCP for conferral of oligomycin sensitivity to membrane-bound ATPase. The passive proton conductance in UF0 proteoliposomes was measured by time-resolved quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine or 9-aminoacridine fluorescence following a valinomycin-induced K(+)-diffusion potential. The data clearly establish that OSCP is not a necessary component of the F0 proton channel nor is its presence required for conductance blockage by the inhibitors oligomycin or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Furthermore, OSCP does not prevent or block passive H+ leakage. Comparisons of OSCP with the F1-F0 subunits from Escherichia coli and chloroplast lead us to suggest that mitochondrial OSCP is, both structurally and functionally, a hybrid between the beta and delta subunits of the prokaryotic systems."
https://openalex.org/W1519201265,"We recently demonstrated that ubiquitinated histone H2A (uH2A) declines 2.5-fold during terminal skeletal muscle differentiation, coincident with reductions in transcriptional activity (Wunsch, A. M., Haas, A. L., and Lough, J. (1987) Dev. Biol. 119, 85-93). To assess whether this indicates an association of uH2A with transcriptionally active genes, we have used micrococcal nuclease digestion and salt extraction to fractionate myotube nuclei. An oligonucleosomal fraction obtained by micrococcal nuclease digestion and extraction in low salt (100 mM NaCl) comprising only 25% of the nuclear DNA contained 90% of the total uH2A, as revealed by Western blotting. Further fractionation of this 100 mM salt extract by sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed that virtually all of the uH2A was localized in monomer to heptamer-sized oligonucleosomes. A second ubiquitinated species of 57-kDa (u57) was also localized in the 100 mM salt extract. In contrast, an 18-kD band (u18) was associated with fractions that were resistant to micrococcal nuclease digestion and salt extraction. Although micrococcal nuclease recognized a unique structural feature of active myotube chromatin, as evidenced by the appearance of hybridized skeletal alpha-actin sequences as a smear rather than the nucleosomal ladder exhibited by inactive and bulk sequences, neither the skeletal alpha-actin gene nor the inactive alpha D-globin gene was exclusively localized in the 100 mM salt fraction. Moreover, further fractionation of the 100 mM salt extract on a sucrose gradient failed to separate active from inactive genes. These findings suggest that uH2A is localized in a fraction of myotube chromatin which, although nuclease-sensitive and relatively soluble, is not enriched in active or inactive genes."
https://openalex.org/W1555244906,"It has recently been reported that free Ca2+, a second hormonal messenger in the liver, can modulate the activity of liver glucose-6-phosphatase by inhibition (van de Werve, G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6033-6036) or activation (Yamagushi, M., Mori, S., and Suketa, Y. (1989) Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo) 37, 388-390). Such a controversial role for Ca2+ is reinvestigated by comparing the effect of the addition of free Ca2+ (10(-10) to 20.10(-3) M) under the form of CaCl2 or of Ca-EGTA buffers. We show that the glucose-6-phosphatase activity is: 1) increased in the presence of CaCl2 at concentrations higher than 10(-4) M and unaffected in the presence of CaCl2 at lower concentrations; 2) decreased in the presence of Ca-EGTA buffers yielding free Ca2+ concentrations higher than 10(-8) M; 3) the latter effect is not depending on free Ca2+ or free EGTA concentrations, but on Ca.EGTA complex concentration. In addition, these effects can be reproduced in the same concentration ranges by MgCl2 and Mg-EDTA buffers, respectively. It is concluded that a physiological role for free Ca2+ on the activity of liver glucose-6-phosphatase remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1609506801,"The effect of insulin on hepatic glucose production has been studied in anesthetized rats in the postabsorptive state. Insulin decreases significantly hepatic glucose production within 5-10 min. It also increases the level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, via an increase in the Vmax of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and concomitantly decreased the activity of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, resulting in a 5-fold increase in the ratio of kinase/phosphatase. Insulin also increased the apparent Kd of pyruvate kinase for phosphoenolpyruvate. The changes in the activity of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and pyruvate kinase were measured after separation from possible modulators, and suggest a decrease in their phosphorylation state which cannot be attributed to a decrease in the level of cAMP or in the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase since these two parameters were not modified by insulin. In addition, neither the activity of phosphorylase a nor that of glycogen synthase were modified. The data strongly suggest that the increase in the glycolytic rate plays a role in the effect of insulin on hepatic glucose production and that insulin mediates its effect on the activity of these enzymes via one or more phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1567438783,"The potent inhibition of herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) DNA polymerase by acyclovir triphosphate has previously been shown to be due to the formation of a dead-end complex upon binding of the next 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate encoded by the template after incorporation of acyclovir monophosphate into the 3'-end of the primer (Reardon, J. E., and Spector, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7405-7411). This mechanism of inhibition of HSV-1 DNA polymerase has been used here to design an affinity column for the enzyme. A DNA hook template-primer containing an acyclovir monophosphate residue on the 3'-primer terminus has been synthesized and attached to a resin support. In the absence of added nucleotides, the column behaves as a simple DNA-agarose column, and HSV-1 DNA polymerase can be chromatographed using a salt gradient. The presence of the next required nucleotide encoded by the template (dGTP) increases the affinity of HSV-1 DNA polymerase for the acyclovir monophosphate terminal primer-template attached to the resin, and the enzyme is retained even in the presence of 1 M salt. The enzyme can be eluted from the column with a salt gradient after removal of the nucleotide from the buffer. Traditionally, the affinity purification of an enzyme relies on elution by a salt gradient, pH gradient, or more selectively by addition of a competing ligand (substrate/inhibitor) to the elution buffer. In the present example, elution of HSV-1 polymerase is facilitated by removal of the substrate from the buffer. This represents an example of mechanism-based affinity chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1571489031,"Subunit VIIa of yeast cytochrome c oxidase is a small (59 amino acids) protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane that lacks a cleavable amino-terminal presequence. To identify regions within this polypeptide that are essential for its import, gene fusions were constructed using a leader peptide substitution vector (pLPS) developed in this laboratory (Glaser, S. M., Trueblood, C. E., Dircks, L. K., Poyton, R. O., and Cumsky, M. G. (1988) J. Cell. Biochem. 36, 275-287). In this vector, oligonucleotide sequences encoding all or part of subunit VIIa were fused in-frame with the coding region of mature cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va. The plasmid pLPS is ideal for assaying protein sequences for their ability to direct mitochondrial import in vivo since subunit Va's leader peptide is essential for import and because subunit V is required for cytochrome c oxidase activity and respiration. Strains containing these fusions but lacking both subunit V genes (COX5a and COX5b) were analyzed to determine whether the chimeric protein is directed to mitochondria. Our findings indicate that the amino-terminal 17 amino acids of subunit VIIa are sufficient to localize subunit Va to the mitochondrion and that a 6-amino acid-long region within the amino terminus (Gly8-Arg13) is essential. In addition, some import (approximately 10% of wild type) is observed with the highly charged carboxyl terminus of subunit VIIa, suggesting that the subunit may contain redundancy in its import information."
