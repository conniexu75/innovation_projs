https://openalex.org/W2790053519,"To identify novel genes associated with ALS, we undertook two lines of investigation. We carried out a genome-wide association study comparing 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Independently, we performed a rare variant burden analysis comparing 1,138 index familial ALS cases and 19,494 controls. Through both approaches, we identified kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) as a novel gene associated with ALS. Interestingly, mutations predominantly in the N-terminal motor domain of KIF5A are causative for two neurodegenerative diseases: hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2). In contrast, ALS-associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain and patients harboring loss-of-function mutations displayed an extended survival relative to typical ALS cases. Taken together, these results broaden the phenotype spectrum resulting from mutations in KIF5A and strengthen the role of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of ALS."

Two studies of mouse models now suggest a hybrid route for tumor cell dissemination. Pereira et al. and Brown et al. used distinct methodologies to monitor the fate of tumor cells in lymph nodes. They found that tumor cells could invade local blood vessels within a node, exit the node by entering the blood circulation, then go on to colonize the lung. Whether this dissemination route occurs in cancer patients is unknown; the answer could potentially change the way that affected lymph nodes are treated in cancer.

Van Vugt et al. trained monkeys to detect low-contrast images and compared neuronal activity in brain areas V1, V4, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Some stimuli made it into consciousness, and others were subliminal depending on their propagation, which can be variable for weak stimuli (see the Perspective by Mashour). Strongly propagated stimuli initiated a state in the higher brain areas called “ignition” that caused information about a brief stimulus to become sustained and broadcasted back through recurrent interactions between many brain areas.

In contrast to well-known paper-folded objects, the wing of the earwig has an exquisite natural folding system that cannot be sufficiently described by current origami models. Such an unusual biological system displays incompatible folding patterns, remains open by a bistable locking mechanism during flight, and self-folds rapidly without muscular actuation. We show that these notable functionalities arise from the protein-rich joints of the earwig wing, which work as extensional and rotational springs between facets. Inspired by this biological wing, we establish a spring origami model that broadens the folding design space of traditional origami and allows for the fabrication of precisely tunable, four-dimensional-printed objects with programmable bioinspired morphing functionalities."

Van Meter et al. report that so much nitrogen from runoff has accumulated in the Mississippi River basin that, even if future agricultural nitrogen inputs are eliminated, it will still take 30 years to realize the 60% decrease in load needed to reduce eutrophication in the Gulf. This legacy effect means that a dramatic shift in land-use practices, which may not be compatible with current levels of agricultural production, will be needed to control hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico.

After chemical doping to remove some of the electrons, charge carriers can move freely. These conjugated backbones can also make the polymers rigid and hard to process. Joo et al. synthesized a redox-active, nonconjugated radical polymer that exhibited high conductivity (see the Perspective by Lutkenhaus).

The fungus then moves to adjacent cells via plasmodesmata, the plant's intercellular channels. Sakulkoo et al. used a chemical genetic approach to selectively inhibit a single MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase, Pmk1, in the blast fungus. Inhibition of Pmk1 trapped the fungus within a rice cell. Pmk1 regulated the expression of a suite of effector genes involved in suppression of host immunity, allowing the fungus to manipulate plasmodesmal conductance. At the same time, Pmk1 regulated the fungus's hyphal constriction, which allows movement into new host cells. Science , this issue p. 1399"

https://openalex.org/W2793464565,"Using iron to generate a copper ligand Many microbial enzymes are metal-dependent, and the microbe must acquire scarce metals from the environment. Microbes that use methane as a carbon source have a copper-dependent enzyme that oxidizes the methane. Peptides known as methanobactins (Mbns) acquire copper by using a pair of ligands comprising a nitrogen-containing ring and an adjacent thioamide. Kenney et al. describe the biosynthetic machinery that adds the copper-binding groups to a precursor peptide. This involves a complex of two homologs: MbnB, a member of a functionally uncharacterized protein family that includes a diiron cluster, and MbnC, which is even less well characterized. The iron cofactor is required for ligand synthesis. MbnB and MbnC homologs are encoded in many genomes, suggesting that they may have roles beyond Mbn biosynthesis. Science , this issue p. 1411"

Both methylated CG (mCG)- and mCH (H = A, C, or T)-containing DNAs, especially mCAC-containing DNAs, are recognized by methyl-CpG–binding protein 2 (MeCP2) to regulate gene expression in neuron development. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the binding of methyl-CpG–binding domain (MBD) of MeCP2 to these different DNA motifs is unclear. Here, we systematically characterized the DNA-binding selectivities of the MBD domains in MeCP2 and MBD1–4 with isothermal titration calorimetry–based binding assays, mutagenesis studies, and X-ray crystallography. We found that the MBD domains of MeCP2 and MBD1–4 bind mCG-containing DNAs independently of the sequence identity outside the mCG dinucleotide. Moreover, some MBD domains bound to both methylated and unmethylated CA dinucleotide–containing DNAs, with a preference for the CAC sequence motif. We also found that the MBD domains bind to mCA or nonmethylated CA DNA by recognizing the complementary TG dinucleotide, which is consistent with an overlooked ligand of MeCP2, i.e. the matrix/scaffold attachment regions (MARs/SARs) with a consensus sequence of 5′-GGTGT-3′ that was identified in early 1990s. Our results also explain why MeCP2 exhibits similar binding affinity to both mCA- and hmCA-containing dsDNAs. In summary, our results suggest that in addition to mCG sites, unmethylated CA or TG sites also serve as DNA-binding sites for MeCP2 and other MBD-containing proteins.

SRP recognizes the ribosome synthesizing a signal sequence and delivers it to the SRP receptor (SR) on the ER membrane followed by the transfer of the signal sequence to the translocon. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the mammalian translating ribosome in complex with SRP and SR in a conformation preceding signal sequence handover. The structure visualizes all eukaryotic-specific SRP and SR proteins and reveals their roles in stabilizing this conformation by forming a large protein assembly at the distal site of SRP RNA. We provide biochemical evidence that the guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis of SRP·SR is delayed at this stage, possibly to provide a time window for signal sequence handover to the translocon."

CHO intake was set at 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes. Blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise. Results Each of the CHO trials (CAV, MIY, SUG) compared to water was associated with higher post-exercise plasma glucose and fructose, and lower leukocyte counts, plasma 9+13 HODES, and IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra. OPLS-DA analysis showed that metabolic perturbation (N = 1,605 metabolites) for WAT (86.8±4.0 arbitrary units) was significantly greater and sustained than for CAV (70.4±3.9, P = 0.006), MIY (68.3±4.0, P = 0.002), and SUG (68.1±4.2, P = 0.002). VIP ranking (<3.0, N = 25 metabolites) showed that both CAV and MIY were associated with significant fold changes in metabolites including those from amino acid and xenobiotics pathways. OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts showed a significant separation of CAV and MIY from both WAT and SUG (R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409). COX-2 mRNA expression was lower in both CAV and MIY, but not SUG, versus WAT at 21-h post-exercise in THP-1 monocytes cultured in plasma samples. Analysis of immediate post-exercise samples showed a decrease in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocyte extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in CAV and MIY, but not SUG, compared to WAT. Conclusions CHO ingestion from bananas or a sugar beverage had a comparable influence in attenuating metabolic perturbation and inflammation following 75-km cycling. Ex-vivo analysis with THP-1 monocytes supported a decrease in COX-2 mRNA expression and reduced reliance on glycolysis for ATP production following ingestion of bananas but not sugar water when compared to water alone.

https://openalex.org/W2792066431,"Antimicrobial peptides represent an alternative to traditional antibiotics that may be less susceptible to bacterial resistance mechanisms by directly attacking the bacterial cell membrane. However, bacteria have a variety of defense mechanisms that can prevent cationic antimicrobial peptides from reaching the cell membrane. The L- and D-enantiomers of the antimicrobial peptide GL13K were tested against the Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus gordonii to understand the role of bacterial proteases and cell wall modifications in bacterial resistance. GL13K was derived from the human salivary protein BPIFA2. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by broth dilution and a serial assay used to determine bacterial resistance. Peptide degradation was determined in a bioassay utilizing a luminescent strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to detect peptide activity. Autolysis and D-alanylation-deficient strains of E. faecalis and S. gordonii were tested in autolysis assays and peptide activity assays. E. faecalis protease inactivated L-GL13K but not D-GL13K, whereas autolysis did not affect peptide activity. Indeed, the D-enantiomer appeared to kill the bacteria prior to initiation of autolysis. D-alanylation mutants were killed by L-GL13K whereas this modification did not affect killing by D-GL13K. The mutants regained resistance to L-GL13K whereas bacteria did not gain resistance to D-GL13K after repeated treatment with the peptides. D-alanylation affected the hydrophobicity of bacterial cells but hydrophobicity alone did not affect GL13K activity. D-GL13K evades two resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive bacteria without giving rise to substantial new resistance. D-GL13K exhibits attractive properties for further antibiotic development."

Here, we describe variable conditions tested during the development of our cell-based drug screen assays designed to identify compounds with anti-Ebola virus activity using established cell lines and human primary cells. The effect of multiple assay readouts and variable assay conditions, including virus input, time of infection, and the cell passage number, were compared, and the impact on the effective concentration for 50% and/ or 90% inhibition (EC50, EC90) was evaluated using the FDA-approved compound, toremifene citrate. In these studies, we show that altering cell-based assay conditions can have an impact on apparent drug potency as measured by the EC50. These results further support the importance of developing standard operating procedures for generating reliable and reproducible in vitro data sets for potential antivirals."

By means of a proton-based nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy, we detected and quantified the urine metabolites of a cohort of 119 pre-menopausal Caucasian women, attending a STI Outpatients Clinic in Italy. In case of a CT positive result, CT molecular genotyping was performed by omp1 gene semi-nested PCR followed by RFLP analysis. We were able to identify several metabolites whose concentrations were significantly higher in the urine samples of CT-positive subjects, including sucrose, mannitol, pyruvate and lactate. In contrast, higher urinary levels of acetone represented the main feature of CT-negative women. These results were not influenced by the age of patients nor by the CT serovars (D, E, F, G, K) responsible of the urethral infections. Since the presence of sugars can increase the stability of chlamydial proteins, higher levels of sucrose and mannitol in the urethral lumen, related to a higher sugar consumption, could have favoured CT infection acquisition or could have been of aid for the bacterial viability. Peculiar dietary habits of the subjects enrolled, in term of type and amount of food consumed, could probably explain these findings. Lactate and pyruvate could result from CT-induced immunopathology, as a product of the inflammatory microenvironment. Further studies are needed to understand the potential role of these metabolites in the pathogenesis of CT infection, as well as their diagnostic/prognostic use."
https://openalex.org/W2793795270,"Avian Colibacillosis is among the major causes of economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide, with a more vivid impact on developing countries. The involvement of several bacteria has made it challenging to develop effective vaccines for this disease, particularly because it is notoriously difficult to make a vaccine that contains all the contributing pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report the design and fabrication of a bacterial ghost (BG) of E. coli O78:K80, which is among the major bacterial serotypes responsible for this disease. The generated ghost is then exploited as a homologous vaccine against Avian Colibacillosis. We demonstrate that hole formation in the cell wall of E. coli O78:K80 can happen properly in optical densities as high as 0.8 compared to the 0.3-0.4 standard for bacteria like E. coli TOP10. This is especially advantageous for mass production of this ghost which is a vital factor in development of any BG-based vaccine. Compared to E. coli TOP10, we faced a great challenge in transforming the wild type bacteria with the E-lysis plasmid which was probably due to higher thickness of the cell wall in O78:K80. This, however, was addressed by treating the cell wall with a different combination of ions.The vaccine was administered to Ross 308 broiler chickens via injection as well as through their respiratory system at a dose of 1010 BGs, repeated 3 times at weekly intervals. Chickens were then challenged with the wild type O78:K80 at a dose of 1011 bacteria together with Infectious Bronchitis H120 vaccine (as immunosuppressant) one week after the last immunization. Air sac lesions were significantly reduced in BG vaccinated groups in comparison with the control group. The levels of IFNγ, IgA and IgY were measured in the serum of immunized chickens as an indication of immune response and were compared with those of the chickens vaccinated with killed bacteria. The results show that O78:K80 BG can be used as an efficient homologous vaccine against Colibacillosis disease in poultry. We expect our findings can serve as the starting point for designing more sophisticated vaccines that contain all three major pathogenic bacteria involved in avian Colibacillosis."

Among these 8,452,912 patients, we identified the 5 leading causes of CV hospitalization and compared rates of hospitalization by age, gender, race, ethnicity, region, year and type of VA healthcare user.The top 5 causes of CV hospitalization were: coronary atherosclerosis, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke and atrial fibrillation. Overall, 297,373 (3.5%) veterans were hospitalized for one or more of these cardiovascular conditions. The percentage of veterans hospitalized for one or more of these CV conditions decreased over time, from 1.23% in 2010 to 1.18% in 2013, followed by a slight increase to 1.20% in 2014. There was significant variation in rates of CV hospitalization by gender, race, ethnicity, geographic region, and urban vs. rural zip code.

https://openalex.org/W2790545798,"Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production."
https://openalex.org/W2790262422,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most frequently used host for commercial production of therapeutic proteins. However, their low protein productivity in culture is the main hurdle to overcome. Mild hypothermia has been established as an effective strategy to enhance protein specific productivity, although the causes of such improvement still remain unclear. The self-regulation of global transcriptional regulatory factors, such as Myc and XBP1s, seems to be involved in increased the recombinant protein production at low temperature. This study evaluated the impact of low temperature in CHO cell cultures on myc and xbp1s expression and their effects on culture performance and cell metabolism. Two anti-TNFα producing CHO cell lines were selected considering two distinct phenotypes: i.e. maximum cell growth, (CN1) and maximum specific anti-TNFα production (CN2), and cultured at 37, 33 and 31°C in a batch system. Low temperature led to an increase in the cell viability, the expression of the recombinant anti-TNFα and the production of anti-TNFα both in CN1 and CN2. The higher production of anti-TNFα in CN2 was mainly associated with the large expression of anti-TNFα. Under mild hypothermia myc and xbp1s expression levels were directly correlated to the maximal viable cell density and the specific anti-TNFα productivity, respectively. Moreover, cells showed a simultaneous metabolic shift from production to consumption of lactate and from consumption to production of glutamine, which were exacerbated by reducing culture temperature and coincided with the increased anti-TNFα production. Our current results provide new insights of the regulation of myc and xbp1s in CHO cells at low temperature, and suggest that the presence and magnitude of the metabolic shift might be a relevant metabolic marker of productive cell line."

Recently, texts have been successfully modeled as networks, where words are represented by nodes linked according to textual similarity measurements. Such models are useful to identify informative topological patterns for the authorship recognition task. However, there is no consensus on which measurements should be used. Thus, we proposed a novel method to characterize text networks, by considering both topological and dynamical aspects of networks. Using concepts and methods from cellular automata theory, we devised a strategy to grasp informative spatio-temporal patterns from this model. Our experiments revealed an outperformance over structural analysis relying only on topological measurements, such as clustering coefficient, betweenness and shortest paths. The optimized results obtained here pave the way for a better characterization of textual networks."
https://openalex.org/W2793664492,"Background Biologics containing growth factors are frequently used to enhance healing after musculoskeletal injuries. One mechanism of action is thought to be though the ability of biologics to induce homing and migration of endogenous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to a target tissue. However, the ability of biologics to stimulate chemotaxis (directed migration of cells) and chemokinesis (increase rate of cell migration) of MSCs is unknown. Hypothesis/Purpose The aim of this study was to directly compare the ability of biologics including platelet rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to induce MSC migration. The hypothesis was that leukocyte-low platelet rich plasma (Llo PRP) would induce migration to a greater extent than leukocyte-high platelet rich plasma (Lhi PRP) or BMC. Methods Bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from 8 horses. Migration of MSCs toward a biologic (BMC, Llo PRP, and Lhi PRP) or the positive control platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) was continuously traced and measured for 24hrs using time-lapse microscopy and a microfluidics device. Cell migration, chemotaxis and chemokinesis were determined by measurements of displacement, number of cells migrated, and cell flux. Results All biologics resulted in a significantly greater percentage of MSCs migrated compared to the positive control (PDGF). MSCs migrated further toward BMC compared to Llo PRP. Cell migration, measured as cell flux, was greater toward BMC and Lhi PRP than Llo PRP. Conclusion The biologics BMC and Lhi PRP elicit greater chemotaxis and chemokinesis of MSCs than Llo PRP. However, all biologics recruited the same number of MSCs suggesting that differences in other regenerative effects, such as growth factor concentration, between biologics should be strongly considered when choosing a biologic for treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. The results of this study have the potential to reduce the need, risks, and costs associated with MSC culture and delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2793735114,"An epidemiological model is presented that provides a comprehensive description of the transmission pathways involved for recurrent tuberculosis (TB), whereby cured individuals can become reinfected. Our main goal is to determine conditions that lead to the appearance of a backward bifurcation. This occurs when an asymptotically stable infection free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable non-trivial equilibria even though the basic reproduction number R0 is less than unity. Although, some 10-30% cases of TB are recurrent, the role of recurrent TB as far as the formation of backward bifurcation is concerned, is rarely if ever studied. The model used here incorporates progressive primary infection, exogenous reinfection, endogenous reactivation and recurrent TB as transmission mechanisms that contribute to TB progression. Unlike other studies of TB dynamics that make use of frequency dependent transmission rates, our analysis provides exact backward bifurcation threshold conditions without resorting to commonly applied approximations and simplifying assumptions. Exploration of the model through analytical and numerical analysis reveal that recurrent TB is sometimes capable of triggering hysteresis effects which allow TB to persist when R0 < 1 even though there is no backward bifurcation. Furthermore, recurrent TB can independently induce backward bifurcation phenomena if it exceeds a certain threshold."

https://openalex.org/W2791574643,"Waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) are all independent predictors of cardio-metabolic risk and therefore important in HIV/AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy at risk of increased visceral adiposity. This study aimed to assess the extent of agreement between these parameters and the body mass index (BMI), as anthropometric parameters and in classifying cardio-metabolic risk in HIV/AIDS patients.A secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional study involving 200 HIV/AIDS patients was done. Anthropometric parameters were measured from participants using standard guidelines and central obesity defined according to recommended criteria. Increased cardio-metabolic risk was defined according to the standard cut-off values for all four parameters. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14.1.The prevalence of WC-defined central obesity, WHR-defined central obesity and WHtR > 0.50 were 33.5%, 44.5% and 36.5%, respectively. The prevalence of BMI-defined overweight and obesity was 40.5%. After adjusting for gender and HAART status, there was a significant linear association and correlation between WC and BMI (regression equation: WC (cm) = 37.184 + 1.756 BMI (Kg/m2) + 0.825 Male + 1.002 HAART, (p < 0.001, r = 0.65)), and between WHtR and BMI (regression equation: WHtR = 0.223 + 0.011 BMI (Kg/m2)- 0.0153 Male + 0.003 HAART, (p < 0.001, r = 0.65)), but not between WHR and BMI (p = 0.097, r = 0.13). There was no agreement between the WC, WHtR and BMI, and minimal agreement between the WHR and BMI, in identifying patients with an increased cardio-metabolic risk.Despite the observed linear association and correlation between these anthropometric parameters, the routine use of WC, WHR and WHtR as better predictors of cardio-metabolic risk should be encouraged in these patients, due to their minimal agreement with BMI in identifying HIV/AIDS patients with increased cardio-metabolic risk. HAART status does not appear to significantly affect the association between these anthropometric parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2792671650,"Background A number of studies have investigated cognitive impairment in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) but deficits regarding executive functions have not been comprehensively assessed up to now. This study was meant to explore cognitive impairment in German paediatric MS patients with a focus on deficits in executive functions and relate these to clinical disease parameters. Methods and findings Forty paediatric MS patients, which presented at the German centre for MS in childhood and adolescence, were assessed for cognitive deficits applying a very comprehensive battery of cognitive tests including the Wechsler Intelligence scale and subtests of the D-KEFS for executive functions. The performance of MS patients was compared with a group of age and sex matched healthy controls using between-subjects ANOVAs. Paediatric MS patients performed worse in tests assessing verbal comprehension and fluency, processing speed, memory, calculation skills and other executive functions. Arranged by the cognitive domain, group differences were most pronounced regarding verbal comprehension and fluency for the WISC subtests Comprehension (p = 0.000), Vocabulary (p = 0.003) and Information (p = 0.005); regarding processing speed for the written SDMT (p = 0.001) and the WISC subtest Coding (p = 0.005); regarding memory for the VLMT training (p = 0.007) and the BASIC MLT pattern learning training (p = 0.009); regarding executive functions including working memory for the WISC subtest Arithmetics (p = 0.002), the D-KEFS Design Fluency (p = 0.003) and the Corsi block tapping backward task (p = 0.003). Fluid reasoning was largely intact. Relations of cognitive performance and clinical parameters were assessed in MS patients. Disease duration was associated with a reduced performance in tests belonging to the domains verbal comprehension and fluency (WISC Vocabulary: p = 0.034, WISC Information: p = 0.015) and fluid reasoning (WISC Picture Completion: p = 0.003) as well as the WISC Working Memory Index (p = 0.047). Patients with a disease onset between 11 and 14 years performed better in fluid reasoning (WISC matrix reasoning: p = 0.024) than patients with a disease onset at an age above 14. The number of relapses negatively influenced the visual spatial memory performance (BASIC MLT pattern learning training: p = 0.009). Conclusions The distribution of cognitive deficits in a representative group German of paediatric MS patients was similar to the pattern known from other European and North-American cohorts. Paediatric MS patients do have cognitive deficits in executive functions and key qualities necessary for successful school performance. Disease duration, age of onset and the number of relapses influence cognitive performance. Cognitive screenings should be implemented on a regular basis for paediatric MS patients, enabling early intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2792310678,"Cellulosomes are bacterial protein complexes that bind and efficiently degrade lignocellulosic substrates. These are formed by multimodular scaffolding proteins known as scaffoldins, which comprise cohesin modules capable of binding dockerin-bearing enzymes and usually a carbohydrate-binding module that anchors the system to a substrate. It has been suggested that cellulosomes bound to the bacterial cell surface might be exposed to significant mechanical forces. Accordingly, the mechanical properties of these anchored cellulosomes may be important to understand and improve cellulosome function. Here we used single-molecule force spectroscopy to study the mechanical properties of selected cohesin modules from scaffoldins of different cellulosomes. We found that cohesins located in the region connecting the cell and the substrate are more robust than those located outside these two anchoring points. This observation applies to cohesins from primary scaffoldins (i.e. those that directly bind dockerin-bearing enzymes) from different cellulosomes despite their sequence differences. Furthermore, we also found that cohesin nanomechanics (specifically, mechanostability and the position of the mechanical clamp of cohesin) are not significantly affected by other cellulosomal components, including linkers between cohesins, multiple cohesin repeats, and dockerin binding. Finally, we also found that cohesins (from both the connecting and external regions) have poor refolding efficiency but similar refolding rates, suggesting that the high mechanostability of connecting cohesins may be an evolutionarily conserved trait selected to minimize the occurrence of cohesin unfolding, which could irreversibly damage the cellulosome.

Plant cell wall polysaccharides are a major source of organic carbon in nature (1Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Himmel M.E. The potential of cellulases and cellulosomes for cellulosic waste management.Curr.

Nevertheless, because of their chemical and structural complexity, these polysaccharides are extremely recalcitrant, and thus their applicability in industry as a carbon source for fermentation is severely limited (1Bayer E.A.

In this system, the action of several enzymes is coordinated by their incorporation into protein scaffolds known as scaffoldins. This is achieved by the high-affinity and specific interaction between dockerin modules, present in the different enzymes, and cohesins, β-sandwich–like modules (7Tavares G.A. Béguin P. Alzari P.M.

Mechanical forces may arise because of the relative movement of the cell and its substrate, which would stretch the portion of scaffoldin placed between the two anchoring points (CBM and SLH), referred to here as the connecting region. In a hypothetical extreme case, if the mechanical load on cohesins were too great, then these modules would unfold and therefore release the enzymes, which are bound via a dockerin module. Because this system's synergy arises from both targeting the enzymes to the substrate and the proximity of different and complementary enzymes when bound (1Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Himmel M.E.

Thus, the mechanical properties of cohesin modules within the connecting regions might be important to understand the functioning of the cellulosome and to design new artificial cellulosomes for industrial applications (11Valbuena A. Oroz J. Hervás R. Vera A.M. Rodríguez D. Menéndez M. Sulkowska J.I. Cieplak M. Carrión-Vázquez M. On the remarkable mechanostability of scaffoldins and the mechanical clamp motif.Proc. Natl. Acad.

In agreement with this hypothesis, it was found that the mechanical stability of a cohesin from the connecting region of CipA scaffoldin from Clostridium thermocellum was unusually high (11Valbuena A. Oroz J. Hervás R. Vera A.M. Rodríguez D. Menéndez M. Sulkowska J.I. Cieplak M. Carrión-Vázquez M. On the remarkable mechanostability of scaffoldins and the mechanical clamp motif.Proc. Natl. Acad.

On the other hand, a cohesin from the external region (i.e. located outside of the two anchoring points) showed a much lower mechanical stability, despite the high sequence identity between these modules. These exciting results posed many questions that remain open. First, considering the high diversity in cellulosome sequences and architectures, which in some cases involve several intermediate scaffoldins, we wondered whether this mechanical hypothesis is generally applicable to other cellulosomes from different species and architectures. Moreover, we must consider that cohesin modules in a particular cellulosome are not isolated but flanked by linker sequences, that they are present in multiple copies, and that they interact with dockerins. Therefore, it is also important to study how these elements affect the mechanical stability of cohesins so we can obtain an overall and more realistic picture of how cellulosomes respond to mechanical forces. Here we use single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), based on atomic force microscopy (AFM), in combination with steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations to tackle these important questions. We study the mechanical properties of a variety of cohesins from different scaffoldin regions of cellulosomes with distinct complexity. Furthermore, we analyze the effect on the mechanical stability of cohesins of linker sequences, the presence of multiple cohesin modules in a single scaffoldin, and the binding of dockerin. To test the general applicability of the mechanical hypothesis of cellulosomes, we first studied the mechanical stability of additional cohesin modules from the connecting and external regions of primary scaffoldins, i.e. scaffoldins with cohesins that directly bind dockerin-bearing enzymes. To this end, cohesins from C. thermocellum and Acetivibrio cellulolyticus cellulosomes were chosen because these are well-characterized complexes with different architectures. In particular, we analyzed the mechanical stability of cohesins 1 and 9 from C. thermocellum CipA scaffoldin (CtA1 and CtA9, respectively) as well as cohesins 3 and 4 from A. cellulolyticus ScaA (AcA3 and AcA4, respectively). CtA1 and AcA3 are found in the external region of their respective scaffoldin, whereas CtA9 and AcA4 form part of the connecting region. CtA1 and CtA9 show the lowest sequence identity among cohesins from this scaffoldin and also among cohesins inside their respective connecting/external regions (Fig. S1), whereas cohesins AcA3 and AcA4 are part of a more complex cellulosome system that contains additional intermediate scaffoldins. The nanomechanical analysis of these modules (Fig. 1) showed that the mechanical stability, measured as the average unfolding force, was much higher for the cohesins located in the connecting regions (FU = 460 ± 110 pN for CtA9 and FU = 439 ± 78 pN for AcA4) than for those from the external regions (FU = 124 ± 25 pN for CtA1 and FU = 209 ± 88 pN for AcA3). Interestingly, despite the sequence differences, the values we found for these two new cohesins were very similar to those of the previously studied cohesins 2 (CtA2) and 7 (CtA7) from C. thermocellum CipA (214 ± 8 pN for CtA2 and 480 ± 14 pN for CtA7) (11Valbuena A. Oroz J. Hervás R. Vera A.M. Rodríguez D. Menéndez M. Sulkowska J.I. Cieplak M. Carrión-Vázquez M. On the remarkable mechanostability of scaffoldins and the mechanical clamp motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The histogram of the ΔLC (the contour length release upon each unfolding event) shows a narrow distribution of values that is similar for all cohesins studied and is independent of their relative position in the scaffoldin (49.2 ± 1.3 nm for CtA1, 49.0 ± 0.9 nm for CtA9, 48.0 ± 0.9 nm for AcA3, and 50.5 ± 0.6 nm for AcA4, respectively). This result indicates that their mechanical clamp, i.e. the region mainly responsible for the mechanical stability, is likely located in an equivalent position. Furthermore, the fact that the measured ΔLC is very close to the expected length for a protein of this size (∼140 amino acids × 0.4 nm/amino acid − 5 nm = 51 nm), indicates that the mechanical clamp is located near the protein’s N and C termini. SMD simulations of the mechanical unfolding of cohesins performed using the published structure of CtA9 (Fig. S2) and a model of CtA1 allowed us to confirm that the mechanical clamp implies the first and last β-strands of cohesin modules (Fig. S3), as was the case for the three cohesins studied previously. It must be considered that the magnitude of the mechanical stability of a protein depends on the loading rate, i.e. the rate at which force is applied to the system. Like in the previous work on cohesin nanomechanics, the current experiments were performed at the relatively high loading rates accessible experimentally using AFM; however, it must be noted that the loading rates the cellulosome may be bearing during degradation of the plant cell wall might be somewhat different. To further investigate the mechanical properties of cohesins and obtain the kinetic parameters of the unfolding process, we studied the mechanical stability of CtA1 and CtA9 at different pulling speeds (Fig. 1C). This was used to calculate the mechanical unfolding kinetic parameters (unfolding rate without force, α0, and distance to the transition state, Δx) of both cohesins. These two cohesins showed a clearly different behavior. CtA1 showed lower mechanical stabilities at all pulling speeds and much lower dependence on the pulling velocity compared with CtA9. This translates to a much shorter Δx and smaller α0 for CtA9 (0.094 ± 0.002 nm and (5.3 ± 0.6) × 10−3 s−1) compared with CtA1 (0.336 ± 0.008 nm and (9 ± 1) × 10−2 s−1). The Δx value found for CtA9 is comparable with that of CtA7 (0.110 nm (11Valbuena A. Oroz J. Hervás R. Vera A.M. Rodríguez D. Menéndez M. Sulkowska J.I. Cieplak M. Carrión-Vázquez M.

This remarkably short Δx and the lower unfolding rates explain the fundamental features responsible for the high mechanical stabilities observed for cohesins in the connecting region, which make these modules more brittle than those located in the external portion. To obtain further insight into the mechanical stability of cohesins according to their location in the cellulosome, we performed a similar analysis using cohesins from secondary scaffoldins of the cellulosome from A. cellulolyticus. In particular, we stretched cohesin 4 of ScaB (AcB4) and cohesin 3 from ScaC (AcC3). These modules are located between the two anchoring points of the system (the CBM and the SLH), although they do not directly bind dockerin-bearing enzymes. Instead, ScaB cohesins bind to dockerin modules from ScaA scaffoldins, whereas ScaC cohesins bind to ScaB dockerins (14Hamberg Y. Ruimy-Israeli V. Dassa B. Barak Y. Lamed R. Cameron K. Fontes C.M. Bayer E.A. Fried D.B. Elaborate cellulosome architecture of Acetivibrio cellulolyticus revealed by selective screening of cohesin-dockerin interactions.PeerJ. 2014; 2 (25374780): e63610.7717/peerj.636Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The nanomechanical analysis of these modules showed that the two cohesins have very different mechanical stabilities. Cohesin AcC3 from the cell wall–anchored scaffoldin showed a high mechanical stability (FU = 458 ± 53 pN), comparable with that of other cohesins from the connecting region. On the other hand, despite being located between the two anchoring points of the system, cohesin AcB4’s mechanical stability is remarkably lower (FU = 247 ± 54 pN), being indeed similar to the low stabilities of cohesins from the external region. Most scaffoldins are composed of several cohesin modules as well as others with complementary functions (5Bayer E.A. Belaich J.P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. The cellulosomes: multienzyme machines for degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides.Annu. Rev.

On the one hand, linkers may establish additional contacts with the module (18Noach I. Levy-Assaraf M. Lamed R. Shimon L.J. Frolow F. Bayer E.A. Modular arrangement of a cellulosomal scaffoldin subunit revealed from the crystal structure of a cohesin dyad.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 399 (20394754): 294-30510.1016/j.jmb.2010.04.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which could lead to its stabilization. On the other, long sequences near the mechanical clamp of a protein might enhance fluctuations of the nearby regions of the module, thus lowering its mechanical stability (19Li H. Wang H.C. Cao Y. Sharma D. Wang M. Configurational entropy modulates the mechanical stability of protein GB1.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379 (18472109): 871-88010.1016/j.jmb.2008.04.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test the effect of the presence of natural linker sequences on cohesin mechanical stability, we stretched both CcC1Link, the first cohesin of C. cellulolyticum CipC, including the nine residues linkers on each side in the pAFM vector. Because our proteins are recombinantly expressed, they are not glycosylated, in contrast with the situation in the native system. This affords the characterization of the specific elastic properties of these amino acid sequences and makes our study comparable with previous research. Unfolding force histograms (Fig. 3) showed that the unfolding force of CcC1Link (398 ± 47 pN) was very similar to that of the same cohesin alone without linker sequences (425 ± 9 pN or 403 ± 64 pN (11Valbuena A.

Similarly, the ΔLC also appears to remain unchanged (48.4 ± 1.1 nm for CcC1Link and 48.5 ± 0.2 nm for CcC1 (11Valbuena A. Oroz J. Hervás R. Vera A.M. Rodríguez D. Menéndez M. Sulkowska J.I. Cieplak M. Carrión-Vázquez M. On the remarkable mechanostability of scaffoldins and the mechanical clamp motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of linker sequences neither affects the mechanical stability of cohesins, as reflected by their conserved mechanical stability, nor the location of the mechanical clamp, according to the unchanged ΔLC. The mechanical stability of CcC1 was found to be lower than that of a fragment containing cohesins 1 to 7 from the same scaffoldin (CcC1–7) (11Valbuena A. Oroz J. Hervás R. Vera A.M. Rodríguez D. Menéndez M. Sulkowska J.I. Cieplak M. Carrión-Vázquez M. On the remarkable mechanostability of scaffoldins and the mechanical clamp motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Because linker sequences do not appear to affect the mechanical stability of cohesins, this difference was hypothesized to arise either from additional interactions between adjacent cohesin modules in the same scaffoldin or from the presence of cohesin modules of higher mechanical stability. To test these two possibilities, we studied the mechanical behavior of two constructs, one carrying a fragment of the scaffoldin containing the first three cohesins from C. cellulolyticum CipC (CcC123) and another carrying the third cohesin from the same scaffoldin (CcC3). The unfolding force distribution of the CcC123 construction (Fig. 3) clearly shows two distinct populations: one with a mechanical stability of 404 ± 64 pN and another one centered at 627 ± 79 pN. The former can be attributed to the unfolding of CcC1, according to the similar average unfolding force (both isolated and with linkers), whereas the high mechanical stability peak shows a similar unfolding force as that of the individual CcC3 cohesin (592 ± 125 pN) as well as that found for CcC1–7 (592 ± 111 pN (11Valbuena A. Oroz J. Hervás R. Vera A.M. Rodríguez D. Menéndez M. Sulkowska J.I. Cieplak M. Carrión-Vázquez M. On the remarkable mechanostability of scaffoldins and the mechanical clamp motif.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Furthermore, the contour length distributions for both proteins (48.5 ± 1.3 nm for CcC123 and 48.5 ± 1.3 nm for CcC3) are similar to those found for CcC1, CcC1Link, and CcC1–7, which indicates that the mechanical clamp is unaffected by the presence of several cohesins in the construct. The analysis by SMD of a structural model of CcC3 cohesin also yielded similar results as those found experimentally (Fig. S4), supporting our findings. Protein–ligand interactions often significantly modify the thermodynamic stability of proteins, as is the case for cohesin and dockerin (21Salama-Alber O. Jobby M.K. Chitayat S. Smith S.P.

Although thermodynamic and mechanical stabilities are not generally correlated, as occurs in the case of cohesins (11Valbuena A. Oroz J. Hervás R. Vera A.M. Rodríguez D. Menéndez M. Sulkowska J.I.

The cohesin–dockerin interaction takes place in a region far away from the cohesin mechanical clamp (11Valbuena A. Oroz J. Hervás R. Vera A.M. Rodríguez D. Menéndez M. Sulkowska J.I. Cieplak M. Carrión-Vázquez M. On the remarkable mechanostability of scaffoldins and the mechanical clamp motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Considering that, in other systems, long-range interactions provide mechanical stabilization (25Cao Y. Yoo T. Zhuang S. Li H. Protein-protein interaction regulates proteins' mechanical stability.J.

To this end, we stretched CtA2 from the external region and CtA7 from the connecting region in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of the Cel8A cellulase from C. thermocellum, which carries a dockerin capable of interacting with both cohesins (Fig. S5). The mechanical stability of both cohesins alone (179 ± 34 pN and 515 ± 69 pN for CtA2 and CtA7, respectively) were found to be very similar to that obtained whe"
https://openalex.org/W2790615827,"More than 90% of the cases of Parkinson's disease have unknown etiology. Gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra is the main cause of morbidity in this disease. External factors such as environmental toxins are believed to play a role in the cell loss, although the cause of the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons remains unknown. We have previously shown that aquaglyceroporin AQP9 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes of rodent brain. AQP9 is permeable to a broad spectrum of substrates including purines, pyrimidines, and lactate, in addition to water and glycerol. Here we test our hypothesis that AQP9 serves as an influx route for exogenous toxins and, hence, may contribute to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) neurons. Using Xenopus oocytes injected with Aqp9 cRNA, we show that AQP9 is permeable to the parkinsonogenic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Stable expression of AQP9 in HEK cells increases their vulnerability to MPP+ and to arsenite-another parkinsonogenic toxin. Conversely, targeted deletion of Aqp9 in mice protects nigral dopaminergic neurons against MPP+ toxicity. A protective effect of Aqp9 deletion was demonstrated in organotypic slice cultures of mouse midbrain exposed to MPP+ in vitro and in mice subjected to intrastriatal injections of MPP+ in vivo. Seven days after intrastriatal MPP+ injections, the population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in substantia nigra is reduced by 48% in Aqp9 knockout mice compared with 67% in WT littermates. Our results show that AQP9 -selectively expressed in catecholaminergic neurons-is permeable to MPP+ and suggest that this aquaglyceroporin contributes to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic neurons by providing an entry route for parkinsonogenic toxins. To our knowledge this is the first evidence implicating a toxin permeable membrane channel in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease."

There are only five species of Synoeca, all construct distinctive nests that consist of a single sessile comb built onto the surface of a tree or rock face, which is covered by a ribbed envelope. Although locally common, research into this group is just starting. We studied eight colonies of Synoeca septentrionalis, a species recently been described from Brazil. A new colony is established by a swarm of 52 to 140 adults that constructs a colony containing around 200 brood cells. The largest colony collected containing 865 adults and over 1400 cells. The number of queen’s present among the eight colonies varied between 3 and 58 and no clear association between colony development and queen number was detected. Workers and queens were morphologically indistinguishably, but differences in their cuticular hydrocarbons were detected, particularly in their (Z)-9-alkenes. The simple cuticular profile, multiple queens, large size and small number of species makes the ‘Warrior wasps’ an excellent model group for further chemical ecology studies of swarm-founding wasps."

HSPGs also regulate neo-angiogenesis which prompts cancer progression and metastatic spread. A different aspect of heparin and analogs is their prominent role in the coagulation of blood. The interplay between coagulation and metastasis is being actively studied: anticoagulants such as heparin-derivatives have anticancer activity and procoagulants, such as thrombin, positively modulate proliferation, migration and invasion. The branched peptide NT4 binds to HSPGs and targets selectively cancer cells and tissues. For this, it had been extensively investigated in the last years and it proved to be efficient as chemotherapeutic and tumor tracer in in vivo models of cancer. We investigated the effects of the branched peptide in terms of modulation of angiogenesis and invasiveness of cancer cells. NT4 proved to have a major impact on endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation, particularly when induced by FGF2 and thrombin. In addition, NT4 had important effects on aggressive tumor cells migration and invasion and it also had an anticoagulant profile.The peptide showed very interesting evidence of interference with tumor invasion pathways, offering a cue for its development as a tumor-targeting drug, and also for its use in the study of links between coagulation and tumor progression involving HSPGs."

HCV hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) was amplified in seven patients (including one anti-HCV positive) and analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS). Genetic variants were reconstructed by Shorah and an empirically established 0.5% variant frequency cut-off was implemented. These sequences were compared by phylogenetic and diversity analyses. Ten unrelated blood donors with newly acquired HCV infection detected at the time of donation (HCV RNA positive and anti-HCV negative) served as controls. One to seven HVR1 variants were found in each patient. Sequences intermixed phylogenetically with no evidence of clustering in individual patients. These sequences were more similar to each other (similarity 95.4% to 100.0%) than to those of controls (similarity 64.8% to 82.6%). An identical predominant variant was present in four patients, whereas other closely related variants dominated in the remaining three patients. In five patients the HCV population was limited to a single variant or one predominant variant and minor variants of less than 10% frequency. In conclusion, NGS analysis of a cluster of HCV infections acquired in the hospital setting revealed the presence of low diversity, very closely related variants in all patients, suggesting an early-stage infection with the same virus. NGS combined with phylogenetic analysis and classical epidemiological analysis could help in tracking of HCV outbreaks."

For identifying sIgE and sIgG4 profiles the blood samples from 513 patients aged 6 months to 17 years who were showing symptoms of allergic diseases were analyzed using microarrays containing 31 allergens. The highest sIgE prevalence was observed for birch pollen (32%) among pollen allergens, cat dander (24%) among indoor allergens, and egg whites (21%) among food allergens. The most common sIgG4 response was developed toward egg whites (80% of patients). Age-related elevation was identified for patients with increased sIgE to pollen allergens and indoor allergens (cat or dog dander and house dust mites). For each allergen, the proportion of cases with significant levels of sIgG4 appeared to increase with patients’ age. The data on allergen-specific sIgE and sIgG4 prevalence show both general trends and some local special aspects that are indicative for the Moscow region.

https://openalex.org/W2793185466,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV is vulnerable to unplanned treatment interruptions–consecutively missed doses over a series of days–which can result in virologic rebound. Yet clinicians lack a simple, valid method for estimating the risk of interruptions. If the likelihood of ART interruption could be derived from a convenient-to-gather summary measure of medication adherence, it might be a valuable tool for both clinical decision-making and research. We constructed an a priori probability model of ART interruption based on average adherence and tested its predictions using data collected on 185 HIV-infected, treatment-naïve individuals over the first 90 days of ART in a prospective cohort study in Mbarara, Uganda. The outcome of interest was the presence or absence of a treatment gap, defined as >72 hours without a dose. Using the pre-determined value of 0.50 probability as the cut point for predicting an interruption, the classification accuracy of the model was 73% (95% CI = 66%– 79%), the specificity was 87% (95% CI = 79%– 93%), and the sensitivity was 59% (95% CI = 48%– 69%). Overall model performance was satisfactory, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.80–0.91) and Brier score of 0.20. The study serves as proof-of-concept that the probability model can accurately differentiate patients on the continuum of risk for short-term ART interruptions using a summary measure of adherence. The model may also aid in the design of targeted interventions."

However, the functional roles of IclR-family regulators in Brucella spp. remain largely unexplored. Herein, we present a structural and functional characterization of Bab2_0215, which we have named Brucella adipic acid-activated regulator, or BaaR. The experimental data presented in this study define BaaR as a transcriptional repressor, identify the regulatory targets of BaaR, and reveal chemical signals that derepress transcription of genes inhibited by BaaR in vivo. Specifically, we have solved an X-ray crystal structure of BaaR, which revealed a classic IclR fold (11Molina-Henares A.J. Krell T. Eugenia Guazzaroni M. Segura A. Ramos J.L.

We found that BaaR functions as a transcriptional repressor by binding to two conserved palindromic motifs between baaR and bab2_0216 (previously annotated as acaD2 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 2) (40Dotreppe D. Mullier C. Letesson J.J. De Bolle X.

A set of structurally related organic molecules enhanced transcription from a BaaR-dependent transcriptional reporter in vivo. Activation of transcription by one of these molecules, adipic acid, required the transporter gene bab2_0213, providing evidence that bab2_0213 encodes an adipic acid transporter. However, none of the small molecules that activate transcription in vivo were found to bind directly to purified BaaR in vitro. We thus conclude that the molecular signal(s) that directly control BaaR-dependent transcription in the cell are distinct from the activating molecules we identified via selective addition to the growth medium. ligand-binding domain helix-turn-helix Protein Data Bank periplasmic binding protein RNA sequencing root-mean-square deviation false discovery rate BaaR-binding site Brucella broth tobacco etch virus colony-forming unit major facilitator superfamily isothermal titration calorimetry ATP-binding cassette Gerhardt's minimal medium Luria broth l-seleno-l-methionine single wavelength anomalous dispersion. Previously, wild-type (WT) B. abortus strain 2308 and B. abortus strain 2308 harboring an in-frame deletion of the general stress regulator rpoE1 (encoding σE1) were subjected to H2O2 stress, and differences in gene expression between the two strains were assessed by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) (4Kim H.S. Caswell C.C. Foreman R. Roop 2nd., R.M. Crosson S. The Brucella abortus general stress response system regulates chronic mammalian infection and is controlled by phosphorylation and proteolysis.J.

Transcription of baaR was decreased 2-fold in the ΔrpoE1 strain relative to the WT strain (Fig. 1A), suggesting that baaR is directly or indirectly activated by σE1. We could not identify a σE1-binding site in the baaR promoter region, which suggests that this regulatory effect is indirect. To evaluate the contribution of baaR to σE1-dependent protection against H2O2 stress, we measured the survival of the WT, ΔrpoE1, and ΔbaaR strains after treatment with 5 mm H2O2. Survival of ΔrpoE1, assessed by enumerating colony-forming units (CFU) on solid medium after hydrogen peroxide treatment, was reduced by ∼1 order of magnitude, whereas ΔbaaR survival did not differ from WT survival (Fig. 1B). We thus concluded that decreased expression of baaR in ΔrpoE1 does not contribute to the viability defect of ΔrpoE1 under the assayed condition. To better understand the structure and function of BaaR, we expressed, purified, and crystallized the BaaR protein and solved its structure to 1.95 Å resolution (Rfree = 21.2% and Rwork = 17.7%) (see Table S1 for data collection and refinement statistics). Two BaaR dimers were present in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, and each monomer adopted the classic fold of IclR proteins (11Molina-Henares A.J. Krell T. Eugenia Guazzaroni M. Segura A. Ramos J.L. Members of the IclR family of bacterial transcriptional regulators function as activators and/or repressors.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30 (16472303): 157-18610.1111/j.1574-6976.2005.00008.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The monomeric protein consisted of an N-terminal winged HTH domain (residues Phe-39–Asp-101), α-helical linker (α4, residues Ile-102–Leu-115), and C-terminal LBD (residues Met-116–Pro-284) (Fig. 2, A–C). The HTH DNA-binding domain contains three α-helices (α1, α2, and α3) and two β-strands (β1 and β2) (Fig. 2, A and C). Remarkably, compared with typical IclR protein sequences, BaaR has an unusually long N-terminal region. This extension is ∼38 amino acids (from residue Met-1 to Gln-38) and is similar in size to the N termini of Acinetobacter DcaR and DcaS and Pseudomonas P1630 (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1). For crystallization, a trimmed version (residues Lys-21–Pro-284) of BaaR was used; the N terminus appeared to be mostly unstructured with the exception of residues Gly-31–Asp-36, which adopted an α-helical fold (α1′) in three of four monomers (Fig. 2, A and C). The functional relevance of this region is unknown; we cannot exclude the possibility that an alternative start codon is used for protein translation in vivo. The BaaR LBD consists of five α-helices (α5, α6, α7, α8, and α9) and six anti-parallel β-strands (β3, β4, β5, β6, β7, and β8) arranged in a semi-circular β-scaffold. The β-scaffold is partially occluded by α6 and folds to form a cavity in the LBD (Fig. 2, A and C). In the LBD cavity of each IclR protein, we observed extra electron density consistent with a bound acetate molecule (Fig. 2, A and B). This molecule is likely derived from the crystallization solution, which contained 200 mm calcium acetate. Notably, the acetate occupied the same position as pyruvate or glyoxylate molecules that have previously been reported to bind to the LBD of Escherichia coli IclR (Fig. 2B) (41Lorca G.L. Ezersky A.

Additional structural alignments and a schematic of hydrogen bonding to bound acetate (and its corresponding electron density in the BaaR cavity) are presented in Fig. S2. Protein sequence alignment of BaaR, Acinetobacter DcaR (ACIAD1688) and DcaS (ACIAD1684), and Pseudomonas PA1630 revealed high sequence identity and common secondary structural features (Fig. 2C). All have HTH domains with long N termini; these proteins also have LBD cavities comprising very similar residues, suggesting that they recognize and respond to identical or similar small molecules and interact with target DNA in a comparable manner (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1). The two BaaR dimers present in the asymmetric unit are highly superimposable and displayed few structural differences (r.m.s.d = 0.76). IclR-family proteins have been found to adopt dimeric or tetrameric conformations in X-ray structures, in solution, or in their interactions with DNA (11Molina-Henares A.J. Krell T.

Therefore, even if BaaR crystallizes as a dimer in vitro, it potentially exists in different oligomeric states in vivo. Our crystal structure clearly identified BaaR as an IclR-family transcriptional regulator capable of binding a carboxylic acid (acetate) via its LBD. To identify genes specifically regulated by BaaR, we measured the global transcriptomic profile of the ΔbaaR strain using RNA-seq and compared it with that of the WT strain (Table S2). Among the differentially expressed genes, four genes were highly up-regulated in ΔbaaR relative to WT (Fig. 3A). These four genes, bab2_0213, bab2_0214, bab2_0216, and bab2_0217, are contiguous and adjacent to baaR (bab2_0215). Genes bab2_0213, bab2_0214, and bab2_0215 are located on the opposite strand from bab2_0216 and bab2_0217, and the two gene sets are likely divergently transcribed (Fig. 3B). bab2_0213 is annotated as a MucK transporter, a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). A transporter related to bab2_0213 in Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 is involved in cis,cis-muconic acid uptake (39Williams P.A.

Koshu grape berry possesses characteristics that make it unique from European V. vinifera as wine grape. However, the physiological characteristics of Koshu leaf and internode remain unknown. An understanding of those characteristics would contribute to improvements in Koshu cultivation, thereby enhancing grape berry and wine quality. To identify the genes responsible for the physiological characteristics of Koshu, we comprehensively analyzed leaf and internode differences at the transcriptome level between Koshu and Pinot Noir by RNA sequencing. A total of 248 and 131 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in leaves and internodes, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of these DEGs revealed that “flavonoid biosynthesis” and “glutathione metabolism” pathways were significantly enriched in Koshu leaves. On the other hand, when internodes were compared, “flavonoid”-related GO terms were specifically detected in Koshu. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the expression of such genes as leucoanthocyanidin reductase and flavonol synthase in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was higher in Koshu than Pinot Noir. Measurement of the relative expression levels of these genes by RT-qPCR validated the results obtained by RNA sequencing. The characteristics of Koshu leaf and internode, which are expected to produce flavonoids with antibacterial activity and UV protection function, would suit Japanese climate as a survival strategy."

https://openalex.org/W2794062579,"When Albert Einstein died in 1955, he had spent lonely decades trying in vain to unify the theories of gravity and electromagnetism. Stephen Hawking, the great British physicist who died last week at age 76, also worked until the end. But he focused on perhaps the most important problem in his area of physics, one his own work had posed: How do black holes preserve information encoded in the material that falls into them? Hawking realized in 1974 that through a subtle quantum effect a black hole can radiate energy and evaporate. But then a black hole should destroy any infalling information, which cannot come back out in the random radiation. Such information loss would wreck quantum mechanics, and Hawking spent much of his later years trying to figure out how a black hole could preserve information after all, even as the degenerative nerve disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis rendered him immobile and able to speak only through a computerized voice synthesizer. Ironically, Hawking9s disability may have helped him avoid the isolation that enveloped Einstein, as Hawking had to rely on collaborators to flesh out his ideas and so remained connected to his peers."

Scientists at both the Spanish Oceanography Institute (IEO) and the Solar Platform of Almeria, a large solar research center, have raised the alarm about what they see as senseless red tape that holds up spending. Some 340 staff at IEO—60% of the total—sent a manifesto to the press last week to warn that the center is collapsing. The problems compound the plight of Spanish science, which suffered from budget cuts during the country9s recent economic woes and faces a proliferating bureaucracy aimed at controlling spending."
https://openalex.org/W2793627096,"Famously playful, Stephen Hawking left a trail of light-hearted bets about serious scientific questions. In the best known, Hawking wagered that information falling into a black hole is lost forever; he later changed his mind and conceded the bet. That wasn9t his first loss. In his first high-profile bet, in the early 1970s, he claimed that black holes themselves—the subject of so much of his life9s work—did not exist. He went on to wager against the existence of cosmological entities called naked singularities as well as the famed Higgs boson. He lost all of these apart from one, which remains unresolved."
