https://openalex.org/W2154005299,"Despite extensive use of antimonial compounds in the treatment of leishmaniasis, their mode of action remains uncertain. Here we show that trivalent antimony (SbIII) interferes with trypanothione metabolism in drug-sensitive Leishmania parasites by two inherently distinct mechanisms. First, SbIII decreases thiol buffering capacity by inducing rapid efflux of intracellular trypanothione and glutathione in approximately equimolar amounts. Second, SbIII inhibits trypanothione reductase in intact cells resulting in accumulation of the disulfide forms of trypanothione and glutathione. These two mechanisms combine to profoundly compromise the thiol redox potential in both amastigote and promastigote stages of the life cycle. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sodium stibogluconate, a pentavalent antimonial used clinically for the treatment for leishmaniasis, induces similar effects on thiol redox metabolism in axenically cultured amastigotes. These observations suggest ways in which current antimony therapies could be improved, overcoming the growing problem of antimony resistance.

Leishmania parasites cause a wide spectrum of human and animal infections ranging from life-threatening visceral disease to disfiguring mucosal and cutaneous forms of the disease. These “neglected” diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in 88 countries in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Southern Europe; millions of people are at risk, and 400,000 new cases are reported annually (1Guerin P.J.

Leishmania spp. are obligate intracellular parasites of the vertebrate reticuloendothelial system, where they multiply as amastigotes in macrophage phagolysosomes; transmission is by blood-sucking sandflies, in which they proliferate as extracellular promastigotes. Treatment of the leishmaniases is far from ideal, and pentavalent antimonial (SbV) 1The abbreviations used are: SbV, pentavalent antimony; T[SH]2 and T[S]2, N1, N8-(bis)glutathionylspermidine (trypanothione) in the dithiol and disulfide forms, respectively; GspdSH, N1-glutathionylspermidine; SbIII, trivalent antimony; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; MEM, Eagle's modified essential medium; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ovothiol, N1-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine. preparations such as sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) have been the front-line drugs for more than half a century. However, the clinical value of antimony therapy is now threatened because of the emergence of drug resistance (2Sundar S. More D.K. Singh M.K. Singh V.P. Sharma S. Makharia A. Kumar P.C.K.

Parasitol. 2003; 97: 135-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SbV is generally regarded as a pro-drug that first has to be activated by conversion to the trivalent form (SbIII) (4Goodwin L.G. Page J.E. Biochem. J. 1943; 37: 198-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the site of reduction (host macrophage, amastigote, or both) and the mechanism of reduction (enzymatic or nonenzymatic) remain unclear (4Goodwin L.G. Page J.E. Biochem.

The mode of action of these drugs is poorly understood. SbIII reversibly inhibits trypanothione reductase in vitro (9Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but this has not been demonstrated in the intact parasite. However, inhibition of this unique and essential enzyme (10Tovar J.

Paradoxically, more is known about the mechanism of resistance to SbIII than its mode of action (17Borst P. Ouellette M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 427-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A considerable body of evidence implicates trypanothione and glutathione (γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) in the efflux-mediated detoxification of SbIII and other heavy metals in the laboratory-induced resistant lines of Leishmania (18Dey S.

However, there are no reports implicating these effects in the mode of action of SbIII. Here we demonstrate that the mode of action of antimonials in drug-sensitive Leishmania is in fact intimately related to the mechanism of resistance. We also show that SbIII acts as a double-edged sword, not only does it decrease intracellular thiol buffer capacity by promoting loss of trypanothione and glutathione but it also increases the intracellular concentration of the disulfide forms of these thiols through inhibition of trypanothione reductase, thereby profoundly perturbing the thiol redox potential of the cell. Furthermore, we show for the first time that Pentostam, the clinically used pentavalent form, induces the same effects in axenically cultured amastigotes. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Leishmania donovani promastigotes (LV9 strain; WHO designation MHOM/ET/67/HU3) were propagated as described previously (23Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cultures were initiated at 5 × 105 parasites per ml and grown at 24 °C with shaking. L. donovani amastigotes used in subsequent experiments were freshly isolated from the spleens of Golden hamsters (24Glaser T.A. Wells S.J. Spithill T.W. Pettitt J.M. Humphris D.C. Mukkada A.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 71: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Axenic amastigote cell line LdBOB (derived from MHOM/S.D./62/1S-CL2D) was maintained in culture as described previously (25Goyard S. Segawa H. Gordon J. Showalter M. Duncan R. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of antimonial drugs on growth, triplicate cultures containing SbIII (as potassium antimony tartrate) or SbV (as sodium stibogluconate, free of m-chlorocresol, a gift from GlaxoSmith-Kline) were seeded with 5 × 105 parasites/ml. Cell densities were determined microscopically after culture for 72 h, and IC50 values were determined using the IC50 4-parameter equation provided with GraFit. Analysis of Intracellular Thiols—Mid-log promastigotes were centrifuged (1,600 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in fresh culture medium at 1 × 107 ml-1, and incubated with antimony. The viability of cells was monitored microscopically and by the LIVE/DEAD™ Viability/Cytotoxicity assay (Molecular Probes). At intervals, 5 × 107 promastigotes were collected by centrifugation and derivatized with monobromobimane as described previously (26Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments where amastigotes were analyzed, 5 × 108 freshly harvested parasites, or 1 × 108 axenic amastigotes, were used. Acid-soluble thiols were separated by ion paired, reverse phase HPLC on a Beckman Ultrasphere C18 column using a Beckman System Gold instrument fitted with a Gilson-121 fluorometer. Recovery of Reduced Thiol Levels Following Removal of SbIII—Midlog promastigotes were incubated in either Grace's medium or in a minimal maintenance medium (44 mm NaCl, 56 mm glucose, 56 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8) containing 112 μg ml-1 SbIII and at a cell density of 1 × 107 ml-1. Following a 2.5-h incubation, cells were washed once with fresh medium and resuspended in either Grace's or minimal media at 1 × 107 ml-1. At intervals throughout the 2.5-h SbIII incubation and for a further 2.5 h following removal of SbIII, aliquots of culture were analyzed for thiols. Regeneration of Reduced Intracellular Thiols—Diamide (diazine dicarboxylic acid bis(N,N-dimethylamide)), from Sigma, was used to oxidize intracellular thiols as described previously (27Kelly J.M. Taylor M.C. Smith K. Hunter K.J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cultures were preincubated at 107 ml-1 at 24 °C for 1 h in fresh medium (controls) or in medium containing 112 μg ml-1 SbIII. Cells were centrifuged (1,600 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and resuspended at 3 × 107 ml-1 in ice-cold maintenance buffer containing 5 mm diamide and SbIII. Following incubation (20 min, 4 °C), cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended at 5 × 107 ml-1 in fresh culture medium with or without SbIII. The viability of cells following treatment with diamide was monitored as described above. At intervals, aliquots were removed and analyzed for thiol content as described above. Amastigotes were treated in an identical manner. Radiolabeling of L. donovani Promastigotes—Mid-log promastigotes were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended at 2 × 107 ml-1 in Eagle's modified essential medium (MEM) without l-glutamine and methionine. l-[35S]Methionine was subsequently added to the cultures to 1 μCi ml-1 and incubated at 24 °C for ∼12 h. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with fresh, unlabeled MEM at 4 °C and chased for 30 min in the absence of label. Following one further wash at 4 °C, labeled promastigotes were resuspended in fully supplemented MEM at 5 × 107 ml-1 in the presence and absence of SbIII (112 μg ml-1). At defined intervals, 1-ml aliquots of culture were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. Supernatants (0.5 ml) were mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Pico-Fluor 40) and counted in an LS 6000 LL scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Radiolabeled thiols in these supernatants were identified by HPLC as above, only in this instance, each sample was reduced using a 4-5 molar excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) prior to derivatization. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and radioactivity was determined. Analysis of Oxidized Intracellular Thiols—At 0, 1.5, and 3 h following incubation with SbIII (112 μg ml-1), duplicate sets of 5 × 107 promastigotes were harvested. In one set, the reduced thiol levels were determined, and in the other set the total thiol content was determined by TCEP reduction, prior to derivatization. Levels of disulfide within these parasites were calculated by comparing levels of reduced thiol, with the total thiol content determined following reduction with TCEP. Amastigotes were treated in an identical manner. Axenic amastigotes were treated with SbV (600 μg ml-1) over a 24-h period. Electron potentials for GSSG/2GSH (-240 mV) (28Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar) and T[S]2/T[SH]2 (-242 mV) (29Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. NATO ASI Series Series H Cell Biol. 1987; 11: 29-40Google Scholar) were calculated assuming an intracellular pH of 7.0 and using the appropriate Nernst equation (28Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar). For GSSG/2GSH (in mV at 25 °C, pH 7.0) (Equation 1), E=E0′−(59.1n)log([GSH]2[GSSG])(Eq. 1) For T[S]2/T[SH]2 (in mV at 25 °C, pH 7.0) (Equation 2), E=E0′−(59.1n)log([T(SH)2][T(S)2])(Eq. 2) The cell volumes used in this calculation were measured using a Schärfe Systems CASY1 cell counter yielding 2.86 ± 0.02 and 0.97 ± 0.01 μl (108 cells)-1 for L. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes, respectively, and 1.74 ± 0.04 μl (108 cells)-1 for LdBOB amastigotes. The Effects of Trivalent Antimony on the Intracellular Thiol Levels of L. donovani Promastigotes—The time-dependent effects of a fixed concentration of SbIII on promastigote intracellular thiol levels were examined in detail (Fig. 1). In the absence of SbIII, levels of trypanothione, glutathione, and GspdSH remained stable throughout a 4-h time course (Fig. 1A, open symbols). However, treatment of promastigotes with potassium antimony tartrate (SbIII concentration of 112 μg ml-1, three times the IC50 value) resulted in a significant, time-dependent decrease in the levels of all glutathione-containing thiols (Fig. 1A, closed symbols). The overall disappearance of these thiols is linear (76 ± 5 pmol min-1 (108 cells)-1, R = 0.99, this experiment; 60 ± 2 pmol min-1 (108 cells)-1, R = 0.99, duplicate experiment), decreasing to ∼15% of their initial value after a 4-h exposure to SbIII (Fig. 1B, closed squares). In contrast, the levels of ovothiol (N1-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine) within promastigotes were unaffected by potassium antimony tartrate (Fig. 1B, triangles), indicating that loss of thiols because of cell lysis is not responsible for these effects. This was confirmed by phase contrast microscopy, which showed the parasites to be fully motile although somewhat more rounded than untreated controls, and by a fluorescent cell viability assay (not shown). Similar effects on thiol levels were observed with amastigotes isolated from the spleens of infected hamsters (see below), except that ovothiol is not detectable in this life cycle stage as reported previously (23Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The disappearance of T[SH]2 was more rapid and pronounced in promastigotes treated with SbIII in a minimal medium, lacking cysteine, methionine, or GSH, than in fully supplemented culture medium (Fig. 1C). Removal of SbIII from supplemented cultures after 2.5 h resulted in the rapid recovery of T[SH]2 to 89% of initial levels within a further 2.5 h, demonstrating the reversibility of SbIII-induced thiol loss. However, promastigotes in a nonsupplemented minimal medium failed to recover from prior exposure to potassium antimony tartrate, reaching only 35% of initial levels, suggesting that recovery largely depends on the ability of the parasites to re-synthesize lost thiols. The effects of a range of SbIII concentrations on the levels of intracellular thiols were measured following 4 h of exposure (Fig. 1D). The loss of GSH-containing species is dose-dependent (IC50 10.5 ± 2.0 μg ml-1) before saturating at SbIII concentrations nearing 112 μg ml-1 (Fig. 1D, closed symbols). As expected, levels of ovothiol remained comparatively constant despite increasing concentrations of SbIII (Fig. 1D, open symbols). Antimony-induced Thiol Efflux from L. donovani Promastigotes—The fate of cellular thiols following treatment with SbIII was monitored in culture supernatants of promastigotes radiolabeled previously with [35S]methionine (Fig. 2, A and B). Following reduction with TCEP and derivatization with monobromobimane, medium supernatants were analyzed by HPLC, and the elution times of radiolabeled peaks were compared with known standards. Fig. 2A shows specimen data of cell-free medium obtained following 4 h of incubation in the presence and absence of SbIII. Major peaks of radioactivity, which coeluted with the bimane derivatives of T[SH]2 and GSH standards, were observed in SbIII-treated samples, whereas these peaks were not seen in the untreated control. In contrast, a major radioactive peak corresponding to [35S]methionine was evident in both SbIII-treated and control supernatants presumably as a result of exchange with unlabeled methionine in the culture medium. It is apparent from these studies that incubation of promastigotes with SbIII results in a very specific, time-dependent efflux of glutathione-containing thiols. The absence of other labeled thiol species such as ovothiol in supernatants suggests that no significant cell lysis has taken place and that efflux is limited to GSH and T[SH]2. Efflux of labeled GSH and T[SH]2 is linear for about 2 h but decreases slightly thereafter, possibly because of dilution of the radiolabeled pool by de novo synthesis of unlabeled GSH (Fig. 2B). The mean ratio of radioactivity in T[SH]2 and GSH for each time point is 1.8 ± 0.2. Since T[SH]2 contains two GSH moieties, this indicates that approximately equimolar amounts of T[SH]2 and GSH are effluxed in response to SbIII treatment. Inhibition of Thiol Regeneration by Trivalent Antimony in L. donovani Promastigotes and ex Vivo Amastigotes—Previous studies (9Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) undertaken in this laboratory have demonstrated that SbIII inhibits trypanothione reductase in a time-dependent and reversible manner in vitro. Unfortunately, direct demonstration that trypanothione reductase is inhibited in intact cells proved impossible, because the enzyme-inhibitor complex rapidly dissociates on dilution following cell extraction and assay (9Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, we have shown previously that the ability of cells to regenerate thiols from the disulfide forms, following transient exposure to the oxidant diamide, is a suitable indirect method of assessing trypanothione reductase activity within intact cells (10Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Smith A.C. Croft S.L. Fairlamb A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5311-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 27Kelly J.M. Taylor M.C. Smith K. Hunter K.J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). By using this method, we have examined the effect of SbIII on thiol recovery in L. donovani (Fig. 3). Immediately following diamide treatment, T[SH]2 and GSH levels were below the limits of detection. After resuspension of cells into fresh minimal medium, in the absence of SbIII, promastigotes were able to regenerate rapidly T[SH]2 and GSH to between 60 and 80% of control values within 5 min (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). In contrast, in cells exposed to SbIII throughout the experiment, both the rate of recovery and the final thiol level were significantly impaired. An even more pronounced effect was observed with the clinically relevant amastigote stage of the parasite (Fig. 3, C and D, respectively). The initial rates of regeneration of T[SH]2 and GSH were ∼5-6-fold slower than in control cells indicating that trypanothione reductase activity was inhibited by >80%. Effect of Trivalent Antimony on Levels of Disulfide within L. donovani Promastigotes and ex Vivo Amastigotes—If SbIII inhibits trypanothione reductase in intact cells, then the levels of trypanothione and glutathione disulfide might be expected to rise in the face of either endogenous or exogenous oxidant stress as well as other thiol-dependent metabolic processes. As pre-column derivatization of whole cells with monobromobimane merely detects free thiols, the total thiol content was determined by reducing any disulfides prior to derivatization using the reducing agent TCEP. The difference in thiol content in the presence and absence of TCEP thus represents the disulfide content. In promastigotes and amastigotes incubated in the absence of SbIII, 96 and 98% of the total trypanothione and glutathione pools were recovered as the free thiol (Fig. 4, A and D, respectively). Note, however, that amastigotes contain ∼5-fold lower concentrations of both thiols than promastigotes. After a 3-h exposure to SbIII, the free thiol content in both cell types decreased by 70-80%, in agreement with results shown in Fig. 1. This decline in T[SH]2 and GSH was associated with an increase in trypanothione disulfide (T[S]2) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) such that after 3 h they accounted for about 50% of total trypanothione and glutathione in promastigotes and about 40% in amastigotes (Fig. 4, B and E, respectively). Absolute concentrations of thiols and disulfides within SbIII-treated promastigotes and amastigotes were used to calculate half-cell reduction potentials for the T[S]2/T[SH]2 and GSSG/2GSH couples at pH 7.0 (Fig. 4, C and F) (28Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar). Both promastigotes and amastigotes maintain intracellular pH values close to neutral, independent of external pH (30Glaser T.A. Baatz J.E. Kreishman G.P. Mukkada A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7602-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In both developmental forms of L. donovani, the reduction potential for the trypanothione couple was lower than the glutathione couple, indicating that the two systems are apparently not at equilibrium. A similar situation has been noted for the equilibrium between glutathione, which forms intermolecular disulfides, and thioredoxin, which forms intramolecular disulfides (28Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar). This is because the redox potential for glutathione is concentration-dependent, whereas that of thioredoxin is not (28Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar). After exposure to SbIII for 3 h, the redox potentials for both couples became markedly less electro-negative (i.e. indicative of a more oxidizing environment) with the reduction potential of the GSSG/2GSH couple increasing by +61 and +60 mV and the T[S]2/T[SH]2 couple increasing by +36 and +46 mV in promastigotes and amastigotes, respectively. Effects of Pentavalent Antimony on the Thiol Metabolism of LdBOB Promastigotes and Axenic Amastigotes—It is generally accepted that pentavalent antimonials, such as Glucantime and Pentostam, act as prodrugs requiring reduction to SbIII before becoming biologically active. Controversy surrounds the mechanism of SbV bio-activation, and it remains unclear whether the amastigote stage of the parasite or the macrophage host cell is responsible. To address this question, a well characterized axenic amastigote cell line (LdBOB) was used to investigate the effects of SbV on intracellular thiol levels of isolated amastigotes (25Goyard S. Segawa H. Gordon J. Showalter M. Duncan R. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Initially, the sensitivity of LdBOB amastigotes and promastigotes for Sb was established by determining IC50 values for both SbIII and SbV (Fig. 5A). In keeping with published data (25Goyard S. Segawa H. Gordon J. Showalter M. Duncan R. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we obtained IC50 values of 8 and 11 μg ml-1 for SbIII in LdBOB amastigotes and promastigotes, respectively. SbV was selectively toxic for the amastigote stage of Leishmania with an IC50 of 200 μg ml-1, whereas LdBOB promastigotes were totally insensitive to SbV concentrations up to 1000 μg ml-1. To assess the effects of SbV on intracellular thiols, mid-log axenic amastigotes were incubated with 600 μg ml-1 SbV (3× IC50), and thiols were analyzed over a 24-h period. The levels of both T[SH]2 and GSH fell steadily throughout the incubation with SbV (Fig. 5B), with overall levels of GSH-containing species falling by ∼90% (∼4 pmol min-1 (108 cells)-1, Fig. 5C). The effects of SbV on thiol redox balance in LdBOB amastigotes were monitored over 24 h. In addition to the loss of GSH-containing thiols, incubation with SbV was accompanied by a gradual accumulation of disulfide within LdBOB amastigotes such that after 24 h trypanothione and glutathione disulfide accounted for 48 and 49% of the total (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, exposure of LdBOB amastigotes to SbV also leads to a significant alteration in the redox potentials of both T[SH]2 and GSH (Fig. 6C). In keeping with our previous observations with SbIII (see Fig. 4F), the redox potentials of GSH and T[SH]2 became markedly less electro-negative throughout 24 h, increasing by +63 and +37 mV for GSH and T[SH]2, respectively. Despite almost a century of use, virtually nothing is known about the mode of action of antimonial drugs. Early work suggested that Pentostam (SbV) inhibits energy metabolism and macromolecular biosynthesis via inhibition of glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation (31Berman J.D. Waddel D. Hanson B.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Berman J.D. Gallalee J.V. Best J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The specific targets have not yet been identified, but hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase have been eliminated as possible candidates (33Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1985; 59: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SbIII also inhibits trypanothione reductase in vitro, but the significance of this observation until now has remained obscure (9Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). More recent studies (34Sereno D. Holzmuller P. Mangot I. Cuny G. Ouaissi A. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2064-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25120-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have reported that SbIII-treated amastigotes undergo death by an apoptotic-like mechanism involving DNA fragmentation and externalization of phosphatidylserine by a caspase-independent mechanism. Three key observations arising from this study are relevant to the mode of action of antimonials against drug-sensitive L. donovani (Fig. 7). First, SbIII induces efflux of trypanothione and glutathione from both stages of the life cycle. Second, significant amounts of both thiols accumulate inside cells as their respective disulfides. The net result of these two effects is to significantly reduce intracellular thiol-buffering capacity and profoundly affect the thiol redox potential. Third, SbV (as Pentostam) induces similar effects in the mammalian (amastigote) form but not the insect (promastigote) form of the parasite. The latter observa"

Misfolded or unassembled proteins are retained in the ER and, if they cannot fold or assemble correctly, ultimately undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Whereas luminal and integral membrane ERAD substrates both require the proteasome for their degradation, the ER quality control machinery for these two classes of proteins likely differs because of their distinct topologies. Here we establish the requirements for the ERAD of Ste6p*, a multispanning membrane protein with a cytosolic mutation, and compare them with those for mutant form of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY*), a soluble luminal protein. We show that turnover of Ste6p* is dependent on the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase Doa10p and is largely independent of the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase Hrd1p/Der3p, whereas the opposite is true for CPY*. Furthermore, the cytosolic Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1p and the Hsp40 co-chaperones Ydj1p and Hlj1p are important in ERAD of Ste6p*, whereas the ER luminal chaperone Kar2p is dispensable, again opposite their roles in CPY* turnover. Finally, degradation of Ste6p*, unlike CPY*, does not appear to require the Sec61p translocon pore but, like CPY*, could depend on the Sec61p homologue Ssh1p. The ERAD pathways for Ste6p* and CPY* converge at a post-ubiquitination, pre-proteasome step, as both require the ATPase Cdc48p. Our results demonstrate that ERAD of Ste6p* employs distinct machinery from that of the soluble luminal substrate CPY* and that Ste6p* is a valuable model substrate to dissect the cellular machinery required for the ERAD of multispanning membrane proteins with a cytosolic mutation.

Protein production in mammalian cells is a remarkably imprecise process, with as many as 30% of proteins targeted for degradation during or shortly after synthesis (1Schubert U. Anton L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). These degraded proteins likely include faulty proteins, which must be removed to prevent detrimental effects to the cell. Similarly, the protein products of mutant genes must also be disposed of, as the accumulation of misfolded proteins has been associated with a number of human diseases including α1-antitrypsin deficiency and Huntington's disease (reviewed in Refs. 2Kopito R.R.

Proteins that fail to fold or assemble correctly are retained in the ER and are ultimately degraded in a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) that involves ubiquitination of ERAD substrates and degradation by the cytosolic proteasome (reviewed in Refs. 8Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 9McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Studies of the cellular machinery that mediates ERAD have been greatly facilitated by the use of model ERAD substrates. In yeast, an ER-retained mutant form of the soluble glycosylated vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y, CPY*, has been studied as a model luminal ER quality control substrate (11Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), whereas the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase Hmg2p has been especially useful in dissecting the sterol-regulated degradation of a multispanning ER membrane protein (12Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a mutant form of CFTR, a multispanning membrane protein, was one of the first ERAD substrates shown to undergo proteasome-mediated degradation (13Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 14Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Other model substrates include the major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain in the presence of the human cytomegalovirus US11 protein (15Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), and the unassembled T cell antigen receptor α chain (16Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), both of which are type I membrane proteins. Studies of these and other model proteins have identified the ubiquitin-proteasome system, whose components reside in the cytosol or on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane, as the ultimate mediator of ERAD. Whereas all ERAD substrates, whether luminal or membrane, are degraded by the proteasome, there are differences in how these classes of substrates are handled prior to degradation. For example, certain studies in yeast suggest that luminal ERAD substrates like CPY* may undergo ER to Golgi trafficking and are retrieved prior to degradation, whereas membrane proteins are retained in the ER (17Vashist S. Kim W. Belden W.J. Spear E.D. Barlowe C. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Caldwell S.R. Hill K.J. Cooper A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23296-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), although these conclusions are not universally accepted (19Taxis C. Vogel F. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1806-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been proposed recently that the degradative pathway for an ERAD substrate is determined by whether the misfolded lesion is in the ER lumen or in the cytosol (20Vashist S. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Thus, a membrane protein with a luminal lesion would engage similar machinery as for a soluble luminal substrate, whereas a membrane protein with a cytosolic lesion would require distinct machinery. Many multispanning membrane proteins, including transporters, permeases, and channels, have large cytosolic domains and only small luminal/extracellular loops; thus, if such a protein is misfolded, there is a high probability that its lesion would be cytosolic as the bulk of the protein is in the cytosol. Consequently, the cellular machinery required for the ERAD of these membrane proteins would likely differ from that required for the ERAD of luminal substrates because the misfolded domains of these two classes of proteins are on opposite sides of the ER membrane. To analyze further differences in ERAD of luminal and transmembrane proteins in yeast, we have taken advantage of a mutant form of Ste6p, an ATP-binding cassette transporter that normally functions at the plasma membrane to export the mating pheromone a-factor from cells. We previously identified mutant forms of Ste6p that result in a mating defect because of their ER retention and subsequent ERAD (21Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, prior to their being degraded, a subset of these mistrafficked Ste6p mutant proteins induce the formation of, and localize exclusively to, a quality control subcompartment of the ER called the ER-associated compartment (ERAC) (22Huyer G. Longsworth G.L. Mason D.L. Mallampalli M.P. McCaffery J.M. Wright R.L. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 908-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that there is a specific sorting and retention mechanism directing certain misfolded proteins out of the ER proper and into ERACs. The ERAC-localized mutant proteins are degraded at varying rates, with the least stable one (t½ ∼5–10 min) being Ste6-166p (21Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This mutant protein, referred to here as Ste6p*, has a premature termination codon at position 1249 (Q1249X), resulting in deletion of the final 52 amino acids in the C-terminal cytosolic tail (Fig. 1A). The fast turnover of Ste6p*, coupled with its large cytosolic loops and the cytosolically located mutation, suggested to us that Ste6p* would make an ideal model protein to investigate how ERAD of this class of membrane proteins differs from that of luminal proteins. In fact, in a previous study we showed that degradation of Ste6p* is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (21Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and we and others (17Vashist S. Kim W. Belden W.J. Spear E.D. Barlowe C. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 21Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have shown that its degradation does not require ER to Golgi transport. Here we compare the effects of mutations in specific components of the ERAD machinery on the turnover of Ste6p* versus the luminal misfolded substrate CPY*. We find that Ste6p* and CPY* employ overlapping but distinct ubiquitination machinery, with key differences in their E3 ubiquitin ligase requirement and chaperone dependence. Furthermore, ERAD of Ste6p* does not appear to be dependent on the Sec61p translocon for dislocation, in contrast to CPY*. However, the ERAD pathways for Ste6p* and CPY* converge after ubiquitination, but before proteasomal degradation, in that both substrates require the ATPase Cdc48p for their efficient degradation. Thus, the ERAD pathway for a multispanning membrane protein with a cytosolically located mutant domain (Ste6p*) has overlapping but distinct requirements from that of a mutant luminal protein (CPY*).

BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid manipulations were performed in the Escherichia coli strains DH5α (26Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) and MH1 (27Hall M.N. Hereford L. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1984; 36: 1057-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) using standard media and techniques. The ubc6Δ and ubc7Δ strains were generated from MHY500 and MHY552. First, STE6 was disrupted in the wild-type MATa strain MHY500 by a one-step gene replacement, and the resulting strain (SM2948) was transformed with pSM192 (CEN URA3 STE6) (28Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) to permit mating with the ubc6Δ ubc7Δ MATα strain MHY552. After selection for diploids, plasmid-free derivatives were identified by using 5-fluoroorotic acid and sporulated and dissected to recover the desired genotypes (i.e. MATaste6Δ with either or both the ubc6Δ and ubc7Δ mutations). The plasmids pSM1082 (2μ URA3 ste6-166::HA) and pSM1083 (CEN URA3 ste6-166::HA) have been described previously (21Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSM1694 (2μ URA3 ste6-166::HA::GFP) was generated from pSM1081 (2μ URA3 ste6-166::HA) (21Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) by homologous recombination of the GFP open reading frame into the triple HA tag. The resulting plasmid contains the STE6 promoter and STE6 open reading frame, ending at the Q1249X termination codon, with GFP and two flanking HA epitope tags inserted in the first luminal loop of Ste6p* (between codons 68 and 69) (Fig. 1A). Plasmid pSM1912 (2μ URA3 PPGK ste6-166::HA::GFP) was constructed by amplifying the ste6-166 open reading frame (including the GFP and HA tags) from pSM1694 by PCR, introducing XmaI and SacII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The resulting PCR product was digested with XmaI and SacII and cloned into the same sites in pSM703 (29Hitzeman R.A. Chen C.Y. Hagie F.E. Patzer E.J. Liu C.C. Estell D.A. Miller J.V. Yaffe A. Kleid D.G. Levinson A.D. Oppermann H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2745-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which contains the PGK promoter. The constitutive PGK promoter permits expression of Ste6p* not only in MATa cells but also in MATα cells in which the endogenous Ste6p promoter is repressed. The level of Ste6p* expression with the PGK promoter is equivalent to that with its endogenous promoter. 2G. Huyer and S. Michaelis, unpublished observations. The plasmid pSM1911 (2μ URA3 PPGK ste6-166::HA) was constructed in an analogous manner to pSM1912, except that the ste6-166 open reading frame was amplified from pSM1082, which contains the entire STE6 sequence including the codons downstream of the Q1249X mutation, and has a triple HA tag (and no GFP) in the first luminal loop. The inserts in both pSM1911 and pSM1912 were sequenced to confirm that no mutations were introduced by PCR. The plasmid pSM1763 (CEN URA3 CPY*::HA) was a generous gift from Davis Ng (University of Pennsylvania) (30Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To create strains for examining the localization of Doa10p and Ubc7p, a C-terminal GFP tagging cassette was used (31Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). The plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-HIS3MX6 was used as a template for PCR to amplify a fragment containing the GFP ORF followed by the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5+ gene. The PCR product also contained 40-bp flanking sequences homologous to the 3′ end of DOA10 or UBC7 to direct homologous recombination immediately after the final codon (and before the stop codon) of DOA10 or UBC7. The PCR product was transformed into BY4741, and His+ transformants were selected. Correct integration was verified by PCR, using a forward primer near the 3′ end of DOA10 or UBC7 and a reverse primer within the GFP sequence. Metabolic Labeling Experiments—Cells were pulse-labeled and immunoprecipitated essentially as described (21Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, log phase cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min with 30 μCi of 35S-Express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per 1 A600 unit of cells; the label was chased with excess cold cysteine/methionine, and 2.5 A600 units of cells were removed at the indicated times. Ste6p* and CPY* were immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (Roche Applied Science) bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and resolved on SDS-PAGE (8 and 10%, respectively). Proteins were visualized and quantitated by using a Phosphor-Imager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), and half-lives were calculated from exponential curve fits using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results; a representative experiment is shown in each case. No difference was observed when the turnover of Ste6p*-HA-GFP and Ste6p*-HA was compared in wild-type or ERAD mutant strains used in this study. 2G. Huyer and S. Michaelis, unpublished observations. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells expressing Ste6p*-GFP were grown to mid-log phase and examined at ×100 magnification on concanavalin-A-coated slides using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with fluorescence and Nomarski optics (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). The excitation and emission filters were 470 nm (40 nm bandwidth) and 525 nm (50 nm bandwidth), respectively. Images were captured with a Cooke CCD camera and IP Lab Spectrum software (Biovision Technologies, Inc., Exton, PA). ERAD of Ste6p* Depends on the E3 Doa10p—Protein ubiquitination requires the combined action of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligases (32Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). The E2 enzymes Ubc6p and Ubc7p have been shown to play a role in the degradation of almost all luminal and transmembrane ERAD substrates, with Ubc7p generally being the major E2, and the requirement for Ubc6p being more variable (10Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We previously found that deletion of UBC6 and UBC7 together results in stabilization of Ste6p* (21Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we examined the effect of single deletions of these E2 genes. We found that deletion of either UBC6 alone or UBC7 alone stabilized Ste6p* by approximately 2- and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 1B). No further stabilization was observed in a ubc6Δ ubc7Δ double deletion as compared with the ubc7Δ single deletion, consistent with findings for Matα2 turnover (33Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In agreement with results published previously (17Vashist S. Kim W. Belden W.J. Spear E.D. Barlowe C. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), we found that Ste6p* was also strongly stabilized in the absence of Cue1p, an ER membrane protein that binds Ubc7p and positions it at the ER membrane. 2G. Huyer and S. Michaelis, unpublished observations. Thus, the E2 requirements for Ste6p* ERAD are similar to those reported for soluble proteins with the Matα2-derived Deg1 degradation signal (33Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and for Ubc6p, itself an ERAD substrate (34Walter J. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3124-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Two E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to be involved in the ERAD pathway, Hrd1p (also called Der3p) and Doa10p (35Deak P.M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10663-10669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 36Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat.

Hrd1p acts in a complex with Hrd3p, along with the E2 enzymes Ubc7p and Ubc1p, and is required for the degradation of many ERAD substrates, including CPY*, Hmg2p, Pdr5p*, and Sec61-2p (12Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 38Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32848-32856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Doa10p was discovered in a screen for mutants that stabilize the transcriptional repressor Matα2 (37Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and also functions in the ERAD of a mutant form of Pma1p (D378N) (40Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3792-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in the constitutive turnover of wild-type Ubc6p (37Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Doa10p functions with both Ubc6p and Ubc7p, whereas Hrd1p action is primarily Ubc6p-independent (8Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). As both Ubc6p and Ubc7p appear to contribute to the degradation of Ste6p*, we suspected that Doa10p might be the E3 ligase for Ste6p*. Indeed, when we examined Ste6p* turnover in hrd1Δ or hrd3Δ deletion strains, we observed little or no effect, whereas Ste6p* was strongly stabilized (∼4-fold) in a doa10Δ mutant (Fig. 2, A and C). The opposite E3 ligase dependence was observed for CPY* (Fig. 2B), as reported previously (37Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 38Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when HRD1 was also deleted in a doa10Δ background, an additional but small increase in Ste6p* was consistently observed (Fig. 2C), indicating that Hrd1p can partially compensate if Doa10p is absent. Therefore, more than one ER-embedded ubiquitin ligase appears to be able to recognize the same ER membrane protein substrate, although Doa10p is significantly more active on Ste6p* than Hrd1p. We also examined the localization of GFP-tagged Ste6p* in wild-type and doa10Δ strains by fluorescence microscopy. Not surprisingly, we were unable to observe Ste6p*-GFP in wild-type cells by fluorescence microscopy, consistent with its rapid turnover (Fig. 2D, panel 2). Most interestingly, in the doa10Δ mutant, we observed Ste6p* primarily in ERACs, a quality control subcompartment of the ER induced by Ste6p* (and certain other mutant forms of Ste6p (22Huyer G. Longsworth G.L. Mason D.L. Mallampalli M.P. McCaffery J.M. Wright R.L. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 908-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2D, panel 4). ERAC localization of Ste6p* was confirmed by colocalization with the ER marker Sec63p-RFP.2 Thus, the formation of ERACs and the segregation of Ste6p* into these subcompartments must occur prior to ubiquitination, suggesting the existence of factors upstream of the ubiquitination machinery required for recognition of Ste6p*. A Role for Cytosolic Chaperones in ERAD of Ste6p*—The luminal ER chaperone Kar2p plays a role in the ERAD of CPY* (41Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), presumably by recognizing the misfolded protein and retaining it in an unfolded conformation prior to retrotranslocation (42Nishikawa S.I. Fewell S.W. Kato Y. Brodsky J.L. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, because of the largely cytosolic orientation of Ste6p* and the cytosolic location of the Q1249X mutation (Fig. 1A), we predicted that Kar2p should not be involved in Ste6p* turnover. Indeed, we observed no stabilization of Ste6p* at the nonpermissive temperature in the kar2-133 mutant, whereas CPY* was stabilized ∼2-fold (Fig. 3A). We next examined the role of cytosolic chaperones in Ste6p* degradation. We showed previously (43Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S.C. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) that the cytosolic Hsp70, Ssa1p, functions in ERAD of CFTR expressed in yeast, consistent with the predominantly cytosolic topology of this multispanning membrane protein. When we"
https://openalex.org/W2101986593,"NADPH is an essential cofactor for many enzymatic reactions including glutathione metabolism and fat and cholesterol biosynthesis. We have reported recently an important role for mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in cellular defense against oxidative damage by providing NADPH needed for the regeneration of reduced glutathione. However, the role of cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDPc) is still unclear. We report here for the first time that IDPc plays a critical role in fat and cholesterol biosynthesis. During differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, both IDPc enzyme activity and its protein content were increased in parallel in a time-dependent manner. Increased expression of IDPc by stable transfection of IDPc cDNA positively correlated with adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells, whereas decreased IDPc expression by an antisense IDPc vector retarded adipogenesis. Furthermore, transgenic mice with overexpressed IDPc exhibited fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. In the epididymal fat pads of the transgenic mice, the expressions of adipocyte-specific genes including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ were markedly elevated. The hepatic and epididymal fat pad contents of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA in the transgenic mice were significantly lower, whereas the total triglyceride and cholesterol contents were markedly higher in the liver and serum of transgenic mice compared with those measured in wild type mice, suggesting that the consumption rate of those lipogenic precursors needed for fat biosynthesis must be increased by elevated IDPc activity. Taken together, our findings strongly indicate that IDPc would be a major NADPH producer required for fat and cholesterol synthesis. NADPH is an essential cofactor for many enzymatic reactions including glutathione metabolism and fat and cholesterol biosynthesis.

Taken together, our findings strongly indicate that IDPc would be a major NADPH producer required for fat and cholesterol synthesis. Abnormal lipid metabolism is frequently associated with obesity and hyperlipidemia. In fat and cholesterol biosynthesis, NADPH is an essential cofactor for numerous enzymes. For instance, 3-l-hydroxylacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase and enoyl-coenzyme A reductase in fatty acid synthesis and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, require NADPH for their enzyme activities. It has been demonstrated that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 1The abbreviations used are: G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; IDPc, cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; WT, wild type; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; IDPcS, sense strand of IDPc; IDPcAS, antisense strand of IDPc; FAS, fatty-acid synthase; LPL, lipoprotein lipase. 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and malic enzyme are considered as the major enzymes producing cytosolic NADPH (1Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the activities of these enzymes were markedly lower than that of cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDPc) in the rat liver (1Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 2Young J.W. Shrago E. Lardy H.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1687-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, McLean and co-workers (3Gumaa K.A. Novello F. McLean P. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) reported that certain adaptive changes in the pentose phosphate pathway dehydrogenases did not take place in parallel with fat synthesis in adipose tissue and suggested that a major source of NADPH for fat synthesis could be IDPc. It is worthy of note that IDPc is expressed mainly in lipogenic tissues such as liver and adipocytes, whereas G6PDH and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase are expressed ubiquitously (4Persico M.G. Viglietto G. Martini G. Toniolo D. Paonessa G. Moscatelli C. Dono R. Vulliamy T. Luzzatto L. D'Urso M.

Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These data indicate that NADPH-producing IDPc may have an important role in fat and cholesterol biosynthesis by supplying the required cofactor, NADPH. In mammals, three classes of isocitrate dehydrogenase isoenzymes exist (6Plaut G.W.E. Gabriel J.L. Lennon D.L.F. Stratman F.W. Zahlten R.N. Biochemistry of Metabolic Processes. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1983: 285-301Google Scholar): mitochondrial NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.41), mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42), and IDPc. Among these isoenzymes, mitochonrial NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (7Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact role of mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and IDPc, which produce α-ketoglutarate, CO2, and NADPH from isocitrate in the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively, are not well defined. Recently, we have demonstrated that mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and IDPc play important roles in providing NADPH for the regeneration of reduced glutathione in the mitochondria and the cytosol, respectively, in cellular defense against oxidative damage (8Jo S.H. Son M.K. Koh H.J. Lee S.M. Song I.H. Kim Y.O. Lee Y.S. Jeong K.S. Kim W.B. Park J.W. Song B.J. Huh T.L. J. Biol.

Med. 2002; 32: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It is also possible that IDPc-mediated production of NADPH in the cytosol may be linked to elevated fat and cholesterol synthesis. However, the direct relationship between the role of IDPc and cytosolic NAPDH production accompanied by increased lipid synthesis has not been established. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of IDPc in fat and cholesterol biosynthesis, which takes place in the cytosol and requires NADPH as a cofactor. Here we present evidence for the critical role of IDPc in modulating fat and cholesterol synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Increased expression of IDPc promoted adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, whereas reduced IDPc expression inhibited adipogenesis. In addition, the transgenic mice overexpressing IDPc gained greater body weight accompanied with hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and obesity than the wild type littermates. We also observed markedly elevated expression of certain genes involved in fat biosynthesis in the transgenic mice, possibly through up-regulation of PPARγ expression by increased production of its natural ligand. Increased fat and cholesterol contents most likely result from the IDPc-mediated NADPH production. Based on the current results, we conclude that IDPc is one of the major producers of the cytosolic NADPH required for fat and cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver and adipocytes. Stable Cell Lines and Induction of Differentiation—IDPc cDNAs in pLNCX retroviral vector were permanently expressed in 3T3-L1 cells in sense (IDPcS) and antisense (IDPcAS) directions as described previously (9Lee S.M. Koh H.J. Park D.C. Song B.J. Huh T.L. Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. When cells reached confluence in culture dishes, differentiation was induced in a differentiation-permissive medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, and 5 μg/ml insulin). After 2 days of differentiation induction, cells were further fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml insulin and were replaced with fresh medium at 2-day intervals. Cytoplasmic fat droplets were visualized by staining with Oil Red O dye (Sigma). Transgenic Mice—To construct an IDPc mini-gene, a cytomegalovirus promoter in plasmid PCI-neo (Promega) was replaced with the 2.2 kb of rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter (10Beale E.G. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3330-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11McGrane M.M. Yun J.S. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Hendrick G.K. Arafah B.M. Park E.A. Wagner T.E.

Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) was inserted at the XhoI and SalI sites of the resulting recombinant plasmid PEPCK-neo to place IDPc cDNA downstream from the chimeric intron preexisting in plasmid PEPCK-neo. The resulting plasmid PEPCK-neoIDPc was linearized with NsiI, and then the 4.4-kb IDPc-mini gene including the SV40 late polyadenylation signal was isolated by the partial digestion of XbaI. Transgenic mice were produced by following the method described by McGrane et al. (11McGrane M.M. Yun J.S. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Hendrick G.K. Arafah B.M. Park E.A. Wagner T.E. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22371-22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the fertilized eggs from the FVB mouse strain. The animals were housed in stainless steel cages in a room with controlled temperature (23 °C) and lighting (alternating 12-h periods of light and dark) and received standard laboratory chow and water ad libitum. All animals were maintained in conformity with National Institutes of Health standards for the care of laboratory animals. RNA Preparation, Northern Blot, and Immunoblot Analyses—Total RNAs were prepared from cultured cells and mouse tissues using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAs from cultured cells (10 μg/lane) and mouse tissues (20 μg/lane) were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to GeneScreen membranes, and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Plasmid constructs containing cDNA probes for ADD1/SREBP1, aP2, and PPARγ were obtained from B. M. Spiegelman (Harvard Medical School, Boston). The respective cDNA probes for mouse adipsin, C/EBPα, FAS, GLUT4, LPL, leptin, and resistin were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR by using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 3T3-L1 cells. The PCR primers used to obtain the selective DNA probes are as follows: adipsin, sense primer, 5′-GATGACGACTCTGTGCAGGTGCTCC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GATGACACTCGGGTATAGACGCCCG-3′; C/EBPα, sense primer, 5′-GAGCCGAGATAAAGCCAAACAACG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GGGAAGCCCACTTCATTTCATTGG-3′; FAS, sense primer, 5′-AATCCAACATGGGACACCCT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-TGCCCATCCCTGAGCAGAT-3′; GLUT4, sense primer, 5′-AAACAAGATGCCGTCGGGTTT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-TGGCTCTCCCACCCTGTTTT-3′; LPL, sense primer, 5′-GAGGAATCTAATGGCCCATAGC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GGAACTCACTCTGTAAACCAGGC-3′; leptin, sense primer, 5′-AGCTGCAAGGTGCAAGAAG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GGGCTAACATCCAACTGTTGA-3′; and resistin, sense primer, 5′-AACAAGAAGGAGCTGTGGGA-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-TGGCTGTGCTGGAAACCA-3′. The relative intensity of each mRNA band in WT and IDPc-Tg1 mice was determined by a densitometer and normalized to the relative intensity of β-actin mRNA band for each sample. To prepare IDPc polyclonal antibody, full-length mouse IDPc cDNA was introduced into the pGEX-KG bacterial expression vector (12Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The recombinant mouse IDPc fusion protein from bacterial lysate was purified by elution through an affinity chromatography on glutathioneagarose gel. The purified protein was used to prepare polyclonal antibodies in rabbit. Measurement of Lipids—The total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in serum were determined enzymatically using the commercial kits (Sigma) based on a modification of the cholesterol oxidase method and the lipase-glycerol phosphate oxidase method, respectively (13Allain C.C. Poon L.S. Chan C.S. Richmond W. Fu P.C. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (7358) Google Scholar, 14Fossati P. Prencipe L. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). The hepatic lipids were extracted using Folch's method with a slight modification (15Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dried lipid residues were dissolved in 1 ml of ethanol for total cholesterol and triglyceride assays. Triton X-100 and sodium cholate solutions (in distilled H2O) were added to 200 μl of the dissolved lipid solution to produce final concentrations of 0.5% and 3 mm, respectively. The hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were analyzed with the same enzymatic kit used in the serum. Measurement of NADPH Level, Acetyl-CoA, Malonyl-CoA, and IDPc Activity—NADPH values were determined by the method described previously (9Lee S.M. Koh H.J. Park D.C. Song B.J. Huh T.L. Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and were expressed as the ratio of NADPH to the total NADP pool (NADPH/NADPt). Each male mouse of IDPc-Tg1 and WT littermates (n = 4-5 per group) was fed with standard laboratory chow from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. daily. At 10 p.m., the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the livers and epididymal fat pads were rapidly removed and clamped between aluminum disks pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen. The time from cervical dislocation to frozen tissue was less than 8 s. Perchloric acid extractions of freeze-clamped tissues were prepared according to the method described by Veech et al. (1Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The concentration of acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA in tissue extracts was determined by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described by King et al. (16King M.T. Reiss P.D. Cornell N.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with a slight modification, in which the C18 column (2.0 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm laureate series) from Methchem (Cleveland, OH) was used. IDPc activity in the cytosolic fraction of cultured cells and mouse tissues was measured at 25 °C in reaction mixture (50 mm MOPS, 5 mmthreo-ds-isocitrate, 35.5 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm NADP+, 1 mm ADP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 μg/ml rotenone, pH 7.2) by monitoring the production of NADPH at 340 nm. One unit of IDPc activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the production of 1 μmol of NADPH/min. Glucose Tolerance Test—Animals were fasted for 12 h, and blood was collected from the tail vein to determine fasting glucose levels. Mice then received 1 mg/g body weight of a sterile glucose solution by intraperitoneal injection. Blood samples were collected at 10, 20, 30, 70, 90, and 120 min following the injection, and circulating blood glucose concentration was measured using the Glucocard (Arkray, Kyoto, Japan). Positive Correlation between the Levels of IDPc and Fat Accumulation in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—To elucidate whether IDPc plays a role in adipogenesis, we scored the changes in the IDPc expression level and enzyme activity during adipocyte differentiation from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Both IDPc enzyme activity (Fig. 1A) and its protein content were increased in parallel in a time-dependent manner, whereas its mRNA level remained constant (Fig. 1B), suggesting a post-transcriptional activation of IDPc during the fat cell differentiation. The catalytic activity of G6PDH also increased in parallel with that of IDPc with a maximum activity observed at the 5th day of 3T3-L1 fat cell differentiation (data not shown). In contrast, the activity of malic enzyme gradually increased during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, but its activity at the 5th day of differentiation was ∼30% of IDPc and G6PDH activities (data not shown). To determine whether the up-regulated IDPc activity is reflected as a cause or as a result of adipogenesis, we prepared 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably transfected with the IDPc cDNA vector expressing the sense (IDPcS) or antisense (IDPcAS) strand, as reported previously (9Lee S.M. Koh H.J. Park D.C. Song B.J. Huh T.L. Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The IDPcS- and IDPcAS-infected cells exhibited 9.7 ± 0.5 and 3.4 ± 0.2 units of IDPc activity per g of protein, respectively. These values are 180% higher and 37% lower, respectively, than that of control cells infected with the empty vector alone. On the 9th day of differentiation, the amount of fat and the degree of adipocyte differentiation were markedly increased in IDPcS cells, whereas both were significantly reduced in IDPcAS cells, compared with those in the control cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that elevated IDPc activity positively correlated with the degree of adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. IDPc Transgenic Mice Displayed Hyperlipidemia, Fatty Liver, and Obesity—To confirm our in vitro results, we also studied the changes of fat accumulation in IDPc transgenic mice. In order to overproduce IDPc protein in the liver and adipose tissues, where IDPc is primarily expressed (Fig. 2A), we prepared a mini-IDPc gene construct using rat cytosolic PEPCK promoter. This promoter contained all the elements needed for the liver- and adipose tissue-specific expression (10Beale E.G. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3330-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11McGrane M.M. Yun J.S. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Hendrick G.K. Arafah B.M. Park E.A. Wagner T.E. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

These three male mice were mated with WT female mice, and two lines of heterozygous F1 male mice (IDPc-Tg1 and -Tg2) were obtained. Of the two, IDPc-Tg1 gained more weight than IDPc-Tg2 (Fig. 2, B and C). Therefore, we performed additional experiments with the offspring of the IDPc-Tg1 line. At the 10th week after birth, both male and female IDPc-Tg1 mice gained more weight compared with WT littermates (male, 32.8 ± 0.5 g in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 12) versus 26.8 ± 0.6ginWT(n = 9), p < 0.01; female, 28.9 ± 1.4 g in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 24.2 ± 0.4ginWT(n = 9), p < 0.05) (Fig. 2D). At 26 weeks, the average body weight of IDPc-Tg1 male mice (39.8 ± 1.5 g, n = 5) was 35% higher than that of WT littermates (29.4 ± 0.2 g, n = 6) (Fig. 2B). Increased body size was much more evident in the 26-week-old IDPc-Tg1 mice (Fig. 2, E and F). The size of retroperitoneal (Fig. 2G) and epididymal fat pads (Fig. 2, H and I) in the abdominal cavities of the 26-week-old IDPc-Tg1 mice was markedly increased. The total weight of epididymal fat pads in IDPc-Tg1 mice (2.02 ± 0.14 g, n = 5) was 5.8-fold greater than that of WT littermates (0.35 ± 0.01 g, n = 5) (Fig. 2C). The size of adipocytes in epididymal fat pads in IDPc-Tg1 mice was 2.5-fold bigger than that of WT littermates (3,145 ± 62 μm2 in IDPc-Tg1 versus 1,268 ± 33 μm2 in WT, n = 100; p < 0.001), demonstrating adipocyte hypertrophy in IDPc transgenic mice (Fig. 2, J-L). The liver of the IDPc-Tg1 mice exhibited a typical sign of fatty liver with accumulation of fat droplets throughout the liver acini (Fig. 2, M and N). However, despite fatty liver in the transgenic mice, liver weights of the IDPc-Tg1 and WT mice were similar (1.70 ± 0.05 g in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 1.61 ± 0.05 g in WT (n = 6)) (Fig. 2O). We compared the IDPc activities in the liver and epididymal fat pads of IDPc-Tg1 mice and WT littermates (Table I). The IDPc activities in the liver and epididymal fat tissues of IDPc-Tg1 mice were elevated by 40 and 170%, respectively, compared with those of WT littermates (liver, 108.2 ± 1.7 units in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 77.4 ± 1.1 units per g of protein in WT (n = 6); epididymal fat, 50.0 ± 0.4 units in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 18.6 ± 0.6 units per g of protein in WT (n = 6)). The ratios of [NADPH]/[NADPt] in the liver and epididymal adipose tissues of the IDPc-Tg1 mice after 5 h of fasting were 0.38 ± 0.01 and 0.55 ± 0.02, respectively, whereas those of WT littermates were 0.34 ± 0.01 and 0.43 ± 0.01, respectively (Table I). The NADPH contents of the liver, although they were statistically different, did not correspond with the differences of IDPc activities in IDPc-Tg1 and WT littermates. This inconsistency might result from the different rates of NADPH consumption in those organs.Table 1Biochemical comparisons of wild type and IDPc-Tg 1 miceGenotypeWild typeIDPc-Tg1Liver IDPc activity (units/g protein)77.4 ± 1.1108.2 ± 1.7ap < 0.001, significantly different when compared with the values for wild type littermates.ED fat IDPc activity (units/g protein)18.6 ± 0.650.0 ± 0.4ap < 0.001, significantly different when compared with the values for wild type littermates.The ratio of [NADPH/NADPt] in liver0.34 ± 0.010.38 ± 0.01bp < 0.05.The ratio of [NADPH/NADPt] in ED fat0.43 ± 0.010.55 ± 0.02cp < 0.01.Serum triglycerides (mg/dl)106.7 ± 2.5181.5 ± 22.2bp < 0.05.Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)68.3 ± 1.9165.0 ± 20.2cp < 0.01.Liver triglycerides (mg/g)12.5 ± 1.042.3 ± 1.8ap < 0.001, significantly different when compared with the values for wild type littermates.Liver cholesterol (mg/g)3.5 ± 0.29.7 ± 0.8ap < 0.001, significantly different when compared with the values for wild type littermates.Liver acetyl-CoA (nmol/g)182.3 ± 3.979.6 ± 5.9ap < 0.001, significantly different when compared with the values for wild type littermates.ED fat acetyl-CoA (nmol/g)12.4 ± 0.69.1 ± 0.3cp < 0.01.Liver malonyl-CoA (nmol/g)14.9 ± 0.411.3 ± 0.4ap < 0.001, significantly different when compared with the values for wild type littermates.Male food intake (g/day)4.4 ± 0.54.3 ± 0.4Female food intake (g/day)4.7 ± 0.74.6 ± 0.1a p < 0.001, significantly different when compared with the values for wild type littermates.b p < 0.05.c p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Significantly high levels of triglycerides and cholesterol are usually detected in the sera of obese mice (17Coleman D.L. Diabetologia. 1978; 14: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). To determine whether this phenomenon could be also applied to the IDPctransgenic mice, we measured the lipid contents in the serum of IDPc-Tg1 and WT littermates. Triglycerides and cholesterol contents in the serum of IDPc-Tg1 mice were elevated by 1.7-fold (181.5 ± 22.2 mg/dl in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 106.7 ± 2.5 mg/dl in WT (n = 6)) and by 2.4-fold (165.0 ± 20.2 mg/dl in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 68.3 ± 1.9 mg/dl in WT (n = 6)), respectively (Table I). Similarly, triglycerides and total cholesterol contents in the liver of IDPc-Tg1 mice were also 3.4 times higher (42.3 ± 1.8 mg/g wet tissue in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 4) versus 12.5 ± 1.0 mg/g wet tissue in WT (n = 6)) and 2.8 times higher (9.7 ± 0.8 mg/g wet tissue in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 3.5 ± 0.2 mg/g wet tissue in WT (n = 6)), compared with those of WT littermates (Table I). These results indicate that elevated IDPc activity is positively related to hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. We also measured the concentration of acetyl-CoA, a common precursor for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, in freeze-clamped liver and epididymal fat pads (Table I). Acetyl-CoA concentrations in the liver and epididymal fat tissues of IDPc-Tg1 male mice were lower than those of WT male mice by 56 and 26% (liver, 79.6 ± 5.9 nmol/g frozen tissue in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 182.3 ± 3.9 nmol/g frozen tissue in WT (n = 4); epididymal fat pad, 9.1 ± 0.3 nmol/g frozen tissue in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 12.4 ± 0.6 nmol/g frozen tissue in WT (n = 4)). Similarly, the concentration of the malonyl-CoA in the liver, the immediate precursor for fatty acid synthesis, was reduced by 24% in IDPc-Tg1 mice (11.3 ± 0.4 nmol/g frozen tissue of IDPc-Tg1 (n = 5) versus 14.9 ± 0.4 nmol/g frozen tissue of WT (n = 4)). These data suggest that the elevated NADPH level caused by the high IDPc activity was likely to increase fat and cholesterol synthesis, which consumes the precursor molecules at a high rate, leading to reduced levels of both acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. It is well established that food intake and weight gain are positively correlated with each other. Most interestingly, our IDPc-Tg1 mice did not seem to obey this relationship, because no significant difference in food intake was observed between the two groups (male, 4.30 ± 0.4 g in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 6) versus 4.4 ± 0.5ginWT(n = 3); female, 4.6 ± 0.12 g in IDPc-Tg1 (n = 4) versus 4.7 ± 0.70 g in WT (n = 4)) (Table I). Thus, obesity, fatty liver, and hyperlipidemia observed in IDPc-Tg1 mice did not appear to be caused by the increased food intake. This conflict could be explained by the different metabolic flux rates in IDPc-Tg1 mice. Overexpression of IDPc Was Linked to the Activation of PPARγ-mediated Adipogenesis—It is well established that activation of PPARγ is an indispensable factor in adipogenesis (18Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the enhanced adipogenesis observed in IDPc-Tg1 mice is mediated through PPARγ activation, we determined the mRNA levels of PPARγ and other genes known to be associated with adipogenesis. In the epididymal fat tissues of IDPc-Tg1 mice, expression of IDPc mRNA was increased by 70% compared with that of littermates. PPARγ expression in this tissue of IDPc-Tg1 was much higher than that of the littermates (4.5-fold; Fig. 3). Other important genes with significantly elevated mRNA expression in the fat cells of IDPc-Tg1 mice over those of WT littermates are as follows: adipsin (10.8-fold), adipocyte P2 (aP2; 3.4-fold), lipoprotein lipase (LPL; 2.3-fold), resistin (16.6-fold), fatty-acid synthase (FAS; 3.1-fold), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4; 4.4-fold), whereas the leptin level was moderately elevated (1.8-fold) in Northern blots (Fig. 3). Most interestingly, little change in the expression of C/EBPα was observed, whereas slightly decreased expression of ADD1/SREBP1 was detected in the IDPc-Tg1 mice. Although C/EBPα and ADD1/SREBP1 are considered the landmarks en route to adipocyte differentiation in cooperation with PPARγ, the two genes did not apparently contribute to the enhanced adipogenicity in our IDPc-stimulated obese model. Taken together, these observations suggest that the increased IDPc activity in the IDPc-Tg1 transgenic mice may lead to the activation of PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis program through increased production of various lipids, which could serve as ligands/inducers of PPARγ gene expression. In Northern blot analysis, GLUT4 expression in IDPc-Tg1 was much higher than that of WT littermates (Fig. 3). The higher ratio of [NADPH]/[NADPt] in the liver and adipocytes of IDPc-Tg1 mice (Table I) appears to accelerate the consuming rate of the precursors with enhanced PPARγ-mediated fat synthesis (Fig. 3). Based on these results, we initially hypothesized that IDPc-Tg1 mice may accumulate fats through their efficient conversion of glucose to lipids without extra food intake. This hypothesis was supported by two observations. One is that the blood glucose level in IDPc-Tg1 mice after 12 h of fasting was slightly but significantly lower than that of the WT littermates (Fig. 4A). Additionally, in glucose tolerance test, IDPc-Tg1 mice showed improvement of glucose sensitivity compared with WT littermates (Fig. 4B). In accordance with the results shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, a positive correlation between the plasma IDPc activity and the body mass index (r ="

The process is facilitated by induction of IκB kinase (IKK) complex that phosphorylates IκB and leads to its dissociation from the NF-κB complex, thus permitting activation of NF-κB. The IKK complex contains primarily IKKα, IKKβ, and the regulatory kinase IKKγ, also known as NEMO. NEMO regulates the IKK complex activity through its binding to carboxyl-terminal region of IKKα and IKKβ, termed NEMO-binding domain (NBD). In this regard, a cell-permeable NBD peptide has been shown to block association of NEMO with the IKK complex and inhibit activation of NF-κB. Given the pivotal role of cytokine-induced NF-κB in osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone loss, we deduced that cell-permeable TAT-NBD peptide may hinder osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion in inflammatory arthritis. Using NBD peptides, we show that wild type, but not mutant, NBD blocks IKK activation and reduces cytokine-induced promoter and DNA binding activities of NF-κB and inhibits cytokine-induced osteoclast formation by osteoclast precursors. Consistent with the key role of NF-κB in osteoinflammatory responses in vivo, wild type TAT-NBD administered into mice prior to induction of inflammatory arthritis efficiently block in vivo osteoclastogenesis, inhibits focal bone erosion, and ameliorates inflammatory responses in the joints of arthritic mice. The mutant NBD peptide fails to exert these functions. These results provide strong evidence that IKKs are potent regulators of cytokine-induced osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory arthritis. More importantly, blockade of NEMO assembly with the IKK complex is a viable strategy to avert inflammatory osteolysis.

More importantly, blockade of NEMO assembly with the IKK complex is a viable strategy to avert inflammatory osteolysis. The transcription factor NF-κB is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types in the body and regulates expression of numerous gene products including its own (1Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 2Abu-Amer Y. Tondravi M.M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1189-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Wang C. Mayo M.W.

Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3173) Google Scholar). Advances made in the last decade have implicated NF-κB as an effector of a wide range of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and associated bone erosion (4Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3173) Google Scholar, 5Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 6Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of NF-κB in osteoclastogenesis was not clear until the double cross of two single NF-κB knockouts, namely p50 and p52 NF-κBs, which resulted in osteopetrosis due to osteoclast deficiency (7Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Young Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Na. Med. 1997; 3: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB dimers is regulated by the inhibitory proteins, IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ, of which IκBα was widely investigated (1Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). Under non-stimulated conditions most of the NF-κB is bound to IκB and retained in the cytosol in its inactive form. Various stimuli prompt phosphorylation and dissociation of IκB from the NF-κB complex, allowing nuclear translocation of the transcription factor (1Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 8Abu-Amer Y. Rosier R.N. Evans C.H. Molecular Biology in Orthopedics.

The phosphorylation sites of IκBα have also been identified, as well as the kinases involved in the process, namely the IκB kinase (IKK). 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB Kinase; NBD, NEMO-binding domain; OCP, osteoclast precursor; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB Kinase; NBD, NEMO-binding domain; OCP, osteoclast precursor; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. The IKK complex is comprised primarily from three IKKs, α, β, and γ (9Stancovski I. Baltimore D.

While the serine kinases IKKα and IKKβ were found to target serines 32 and 36 of the IκBα, the role of IKKγ (also known as NEMO) was deemed regulatory of the other IKKs (13Li X. Massa P.E. Hanidu A.

Genetic studies have demonstrated that IKKα and IKKβ play distinct roles with respect to NF-κB activation. In this regard, IKKβ is responsible for pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent activation of classical NF-κB complexes containing the p50 and p65 subunits, whereas IKKα plays a significant albeit poorly defined role in keratinocyte differentiation independent of its catalytic activity (15Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang M. Nat. Rev. 2004; 3: 17-26Google Scholar, 16Israel A. Nature. 2003; 423: 596-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, it was shown recently that IKKα catalytic activity is required for RANKL-induced NF-κB activation in mammary epithelial cells (17Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and B-lymphocytes (18Kaisho T. Takeda K. Tsujimura T. Kawai T. Nomura F. Terada N. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these mechanisms were associated with the non-classical (non-canonical) NF-κB activation pathway, namely targeting the NF-κB2/p100 to process p52NF-κB (19Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that IKKα and IKKβ are prone to execute distinct signaling pathways based on the nature of their own activation. This activation of the IKKs is tightly regulated by the non-catalytic IKKγ/NEMO (14Li X.H. Fang X. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4494-4500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Prajapati S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24331-24339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). NEMO is critical for pro-inflammatory activation of the IKK complex (15Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang M. Nat. Rev. 2004; 3: 17-26Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of NEMO action is poorly understood, it was speculated that it recruits the IKK complex to ligated cytokine receptors and facilitates transphosphorylation events (14Li X.H. Fang X. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4494-4500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Zutter M.M. Ryan E.E. Painter A.D. Blood. 1997; 90: 678-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More intriguingly, NEMO may facilitate the recruitment of upstream IKK activators such as kinases that specifically target the activation loops within the catalytic domains of the IKK subunits (22Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Science. 1998; 395: 297-300Google Scholar). Recent advances have identified that an NH2-terminal α-helical region of NEMO associates with a hexapeptide sequence within the extreme carboxyl terminus of IKKβ and IKKα, termed NEMO-binding domain (NBD) (23May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Importantly, short cell-permeable peptide spanning the IKKβ NBD disrupted the association of NEMO with IKKβ, blocked NF-κB activation, and ameliorated responses in animal models of inflammation (23May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). These observations position the IKKβ NBD as a viable target for the design of anti-inflammatory drugs. Furthermore, given the central role of NF-κB (the downstream target of the IKK complex) in osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone loss diseases (4Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3173) Google Scholar, 6Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Clohisy J.C. Roy B.C. Biondo C. Frazier E.

Boyle D.L. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), NBD is indeed an attractive target to be tested in this subset of diseases. Having shown that direct inhibition of NF-κB by dominant-negative forms of IκB blocks osteoclastogenesis, inhibits bone resorption in vivo, and ameliorates arthritic bone erosion, we deduced that inhibiting the assembly of IKK complex through administration of NBD peptide will result in NF-κB inhibition and consequently to inhibition of inflammatory osteolysis. Our results indicate that TAT-NBD peptide inhibits IKK and NF-κB activation and arrests osteoclastogenesis in vitro. More intriguingly, NBD is sufficient to block in vivo activation of NF-κB, dampens osteoclasts formation and bone erosion, and ameliorates inflammatory arthritis. Reagents—All cytokines were from R&D Industries. All antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Cell Isolation and Purification—Osteoclast precursors (OCPs) in the form of marrow macrophages were isolated from whole bone marrow of 4–6-week-old mice and incubated in tissue culture plates, at 37 °C in 5% CO2, in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF (27Clohisy D.R. Chappel J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5370-5377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h in culture, the non-adherent cells were collected and layered on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. Cells at the gradient interface were further purified with CD11b (Pharmingen) antibody and Dynabeads (Dynal) following the manufacturer's instructions, collected, and plated in α-minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF, and plated according to each experimental conditions. Mice—KRN-TCR (K/B) transgenic mice on a B6 background were kindly provided by D. Mathis and C. Benoist (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). K/B×N mice were generated by breeding KRN-TCR with non-obese diabetic mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY). All mice were housed under a controlled barrier facility at Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Balb/c mice (4–6 weeks old) were used to obtain primary OCPs and for in vivo experiments with NBD peptides. Arthritogenic Serum—Serum is obtained from K/B×N mice (6–12 weeks old), pooled, and stored in aliquots in –70 °C until used. A single dose of 150 μl of serum per mouse was selected as optimal to induce arthritis in 100% of the mice. Three- to four-week-old Balb/c mice will be injected intra-peritoneally with phosphate-buffered saline, serum (150 μl) with or without wild type TAT-NBD peptide, or mutant NBD peptide (∼3 mg/kg body weight was established as optimal dose for NBD). NBD peptides were injected on first and third day of experiment. Control mice developed swelling and redness of paws starting as early as 48-h post-serum injection. All mice were sacrificed on day 7 for examination. Tissue Collection—Knee and ankle joints were excised and skin and soft tissues removed. These joints were snap-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. For cellular and nuclear isolation, extracts were prepared from mouse paws following the procedure described by Han et al. (28Han Z. Boyle D. Chang L. Bennet B. Karin M. Yang L. Manning A. Firestein G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In brief, whole mouse joints and paws were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, crushed using a stainless steel motar and pestel, and then pulverized using CertiPrep Freezer Mill 6570 (Spex CertiPrep Inc., Metuchen, NJ) under liquid nitrogen to achieve a fine powder of ∼2 × 1 mm. Equal amounts were then subjected to lysis or nuclear isolation as described previously (25Clohisy J.C. Roy B.C. Biondo C. Frazier E. Willis D. Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5547-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For histology, intact limbs were skinned and processed for histology as described elsewhere (25Clohisy J.C. Roy B.C. Biondo C. Frazier E. Willis D. Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5547-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Histology—For histology intact limbs were preserved in 10% buffered formalin (24 h), skinned, and subjected to a decalcification process using 10% EDTA, pH 7.0, for 7 days with gentle rocking and daily replacement of solution. Decalcified bones were then dehydrated in graded alcohol, cleared through xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin blocks were sectioned longitudinally. Five-micron sections were then stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or histochemically for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) to determine osteoclasts. TAT-NBD Peptide—For TAT-NBD peptides, we synthesized and high performance liquid chromatography-purified (using Washington University facility) two peptides: 1) functional wild type TAT-NBD (YGRKKRRQRRR-G-TTLDWSWLQME) and 2) negative control mutant TAT-NBD (YGRKKRRQRRR-G-TTLDASALQME). Kinase Assays—Extracts prepared from the various cells or tissues under use were suspended in lysis buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, pH 10.0, and protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The cellular lysates (500 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the relevant antibody (anti-IKKα, anti-IKKβ, or isotype-matched IgG) and gamma-bind Sepharose (25 μl). After washing of the immunoprecipitates, kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, pH 10.0, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μg of the GST-IκBα (aa 1–54). Phosphorylation of GST-IκB was then detected by immunoblots. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (29Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, cells retrieved from joint tissue were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 15 min, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.64%. Nuclei were pelleted, and the cytosolic fraction was carefully removed. The nuclei were then resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin), vortexed for 30 s, and rotated for 30 min in 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged, and the nuclear proteins in the supernatant were transferred to fresh tubes and protein content was measured using standard BCA kit (Pierce). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with an end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the sequence 5′-AAA CAG GGG GCT TTC CCT CCT C-3′ (31Drouet C. Shakhov A.N. Jongeneel C.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1694-1700PubMed Google Scholar) derived from the κB3 site of the TNF promoter. The reaction was performed in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were then fractionated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposing dried gel to film. Wild Type NBD Peptide Inhibits IKK and NF-κB Activation in OCPs—IKK induction is essential for phosphorylation of IκB and subsequent activation of NF-κB. Given that activation of IKKs requires recruitment of NEMO, we utilized an excess TAT-NBD peptide designed in its wild type form to sequester NEMO and prevent binding to IKKβ. Our results show that wild type NBD (50 and 200 μm) is sufficient to block RANKL (Fig. 1A) and TNF-activation (not shown) of IKK, whereas mutated NBD fails to do so (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, wild type NBD, but not mutant NBD, blocks NF-κB DNA binding (Fig. 1B) and promoter activity by OCPs (data not shown). Inhibition of NF-κB Activation by NBD Peptide Arrests Osteoclastogenesis—We and others (32Abbas S. Abu-Amer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20077-20082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have shown that NF-κBis essential for osteoclast differentiation and survival and that inhibition of NF-κB activation by dominant-negative IκBs attenuates osteoclastogenesis and induce osteoclast apoptosis. Given that NBD appears to be a potent inhibitor of this pathway in OCPs, we examined whether the peptide impacts differentiation of OCPs into mature osteoclasts. The data presented in Fig. 2a demonstrate that NBD strongly inhibits basal (RANKL) and TNF-stimulated osteoclast differentiation in vitro as evident by significant reduction of multinucleated TRAP-expressing cells. Significant inhibition of osteoclasts was achieved with 50 μm, whereas a dose of 200 μm appears maximal (Fig. 2b). These results were complemented by lack of such inhibition when mutant NBD peptide is used. Thus, wild type, not mutant, NBD peptide inhibits in vitro osteoclastogenesis. NBD Peptide Inhibits IKK and NF-κB Activation in Inflammatory Arthritis—We have demonstrated that NF-κB plays a pivotal role in erosive arthritis in the serum-transfer model of inflammatory arthritis (25Clohisy J.C. Roy B.C. Biondo C. Frazier E. Willis D. Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5547-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to examine whether NBD inhibits this pathway in this inflammatory model. Wild type NBD peptide blocks IKK activation in cellular extracts (Fig. 3a) and histological sections (Fig. 3b) obtained form the joints of arthritic mice as demonstrated by kinase assays and immunoblots for active IKKs. These observations were consistent with dramatic inhibition of NF-κB activation observed in cells retrieved from the same joints and processed for EMSA experiments (Fig. 3c). In contrast, activation of IKK and NF-κB in arthritic mice was unaffected in the presence of excess mutant NBD peptide at the optimal doses used. NBD Peptide Inhibits Osteoclast Formation and Bone Destruction in the Joints of Mice Bearing Inflammatory Arthritis—NF-κB activation modulates in vivo differentiation of osteoclasts (25Clohisy J.C. Roy B.C. Biondo C. Frazier E. Willis D. Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5547-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of NBD peptide on in vivo osteoclastogenesis and on bone erosion associated with inflammatory arthritis. We document that the peptide strongly inhibits osteoclast formation in the joints of arthritic mice (Fig. 4, arrows). Moreover, examination of ankle and knee joints from these mice indicates that NBD peptide significantly reduces focal bone erosion and plummets cellularity (Fig. 4, asterisks), whereas mutant NBD peptide has no such effect. Altogether, these observations point out that IKK complex assembly and activation leading to activation of NF-κB are central to erosive arthritis. More importantly, the data provide evidence that targeted inhibition of this pathway by NBD peptide is sufficient to attenuate this erosive process. In our previous studies, we have shown that inhibition of NF-κB activation through the use of dominant-negative forms of IκB, inhibits osteoclast differentiation in vitro (33Abu-Amer Y. Dowdy S.F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30499-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), induces apoptosis of osteoclasts and their precursors (32Abbas S. Abu-Amer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20077-20082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and, most importantly, attenuates in vivo osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion and alleviates inflammatory erosive arthritis (25Clohisy J.C. Roy B.C. Biondo C. Frazier E. Willis D. Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5547-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The principal of this inhibition entails introduction of excess dominant-negative IκB that displaces the in vivo moiety and that does not undergo phosphorylation. The resultant DN-IκB/NF-κB complex is then presumed stable for a longer time leading to significant delays and attenuation of NF-κB-dependent gene activation functions. In the current study, and along similar principles, we have utilized a NEMO-binding domain that binds NEMO and compromises formation of active IKK complex. This sequestration disables IKK functions, primarily the immediate phosphorylation of IκB and activation of NF-κB. However, it should be noted that levels of IκB under these circumstances are likely to be physiologically relevant unlike supraphysiological levels of the dominant-negative forms required to achieve blockade of the NF-κB pathway, thus avoiding likely complications of cytotoxicity associated with previous models. The current study provides clear indications that IKKs modulate osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory responses leading to bone erosion. These findings were not obvious in IKK knock-out animals due to their lethality, notwithstanding ample studies with NF-κB-compromised systems, clearly pointed to the central role of this pathway in inflammatory osteolysis. Despite the fact that NF-κB activates a wide range of genes, inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis are increasingly perceived to be central to the activation of this transcription factor. This is supported by this and a previous report (25Clohisy J.C. Roy B.C. Biondo C. Frazier E. Willis D. Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5547-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showing little or no adverse effects resulting from blockade of NF-κB pathway for therapeutic purposes. This seemingly high selectivity could be interpreted by targeting specific heterodimeric compositions of NF-κB. Although not clear at the moment, this speculation is in agreement with the diverse classical and non-classical activation pathways of NF-κB and their differential preference to IKK subtypes. Our data also point to a high selectivity of the NBD peptide toward in vivo blockade of osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone erosion. The basis of such selectivity mandates further investigation in light of previous findings, including our own, that implicate the NF-κB pathway as a prosurvival mechanism. In this regard, we have shown that optimal apoptosis of macrophages and osteoclasts under conditions of NF-κB inhibition requires stimulation of the cells with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF (32Abbas S. Abu-Amer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20077-20082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous observations where we documented that inhibition of NF-κB dampens the levels of pro-osteoclastogenic and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. RANKL and TNF) in vivo (25Clohisy J.C. Roy B.C. Biondo C. Frazier E. Willis D. Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5547-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Taken together, inhibition of NF-κB appears to dampen expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and as a result thwarts undesired apoptotic and other responses. Until the precise mechanism by which NF-κB modulates inflammatory osteolysis is uncovered, the use of the NBD peptide could be considered as a promising tool for therapeutic intervention to alleviate inflammatory focal bone erosion and ameliorate inflammatory arthritis."

In this study, we used fibroblasts derived from GSK-3β gene-deleted mice to understand the role of this kinase in TNF signaling. TNF induced NF-κB activation as measured by DNA binding in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, but deletion of GSK-3β abolished this activation. This inhibition was due to suppression of IκBα kinase activation and IκBα phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation. TNF-induced NF-κB reporter gene transcription was also suppressed in GSK-3β gene-deleted cells. NF-κB activation induced by lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1β, or cigarette smoke condensate was completely suppressed in GSK-3β–/– cells. Deletion of GSK-3β also abolished TNF-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p44/p42 mitogen-activated kinase activation.

Most interestingly, however, disruption of the murine GSK-3β gene results in embryonic lethality caused by severe liver degeneration during development (18Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar); moreover, cells with the GSK-3β gene deleted are more sensitive to apoptosis. These results indicate that GSK-3β has a role in cell survival. TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine produced primarily by macrophages and known to activate apoptosis, NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p44/p42 MAPK, and Akt (52Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation by TNF requires activation of IκBα kinase (IKK) that causes phosphorylation of IκBα, leading to ubiquitination and degradation and resulting in nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 subunit complexes of NF-κB. How GSK-3β affects TNF-induced signaling is not well understood. In the study presented here, we used GSK-3β gene-deleted cells to delineate the role of this kinase in TNF signaling. We demonstrate that GSK-3β is required for TNF-induced activation of IKK, JNK, p44/p42 MAPK, and Akt. NF-κB-regulated gene products such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, survivin, inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein 1 (IAP 1), IAP 2, Bcl-xL, Bfl-1/A1, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)1, and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE)-inhibitory protein (FLIP) were down-regulated by deletion of GSK-3β, which led to potentiation of apoptosis induced by TNF.

Anti-IKK-α, anti-IKK-β, and anti-FLIP antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex (San Diego, CA). A polyclonal antibody that recognizes the serine 529 phosphorylated form of p65 was obtained from Rockland Laboratories (Gilbertsville, PA). Cell Lines—The mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) derived from GSK-3β–/– C57Bl/6J mice and its wild type were kindly provided by Dr. James R. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada). These cells have been well characterized and described (18Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The MEF derived from p65–/– C57Bl/6J mice and its wild type were kindly provided by Dr. David Baltimore (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). These cells have been well characterized and described (34Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—To determine NF-κB activation, we performed EMSA as described (35Shishodia S. Majumdar S. Banerjee S. Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4375-4383PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells (1 × 106/ml) were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (15 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (boldface indicates NF-κB-binding sites), for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against either p50 or p65 of NF-κB for 30 min at 37 °C before the complex was analyzed by EMSA. Antibodies against cyclin D1 and preimmune serum were included as negative controls. The dried gels were visualized and radioactive bands quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant software. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of protein expression in the cytoplasm or nucleus, we prepared extracts of each from TNF-treated cells (36Manna S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4927-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and fractionated them by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blotted with each antibody, and detected by ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The bands obtained were quantitated by using an NIH image (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). IKK Assay—The IKK assay was performed by a method described previously (37Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Briefly, IKK complexes from whole-cell extracts were precipitated with antibody against IKK-α and then were treated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then assayed in a kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE; the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized by PhosphorImager. To determine the total amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β in each sample, 50 μg of the whole-cell protein was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electro-transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with either anti-IKK-α or anti-IKK-β antibody. NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression Assay—To examine TNF-induced reporter gene expression, cells (3 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method with pNF-κB-secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP, 0.5 μg) and the control plasmid pCMVFLAG1 DNA (2 μg). After 24 h, cells were washed, exposed to 1 nm TNF for 24 h, harvested from the cell culture medium, and then analyzed for SEAP activity according to the protocol essentially as described by the manufacturer (Clontech) using a 96-well fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroscan II; Labsystems, Chicago) with excitation set at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—These assays were performed essentially as described previously (38Wang H. Yang L. Jamaluddin M.S. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22674-22683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, TNF-treated and untreated cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 8 min to cross-link proteins to DNA. The cells were collected, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then washed sequentially for 10 min in ice-cold solution 1 (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and thereafter in solution 2 (0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors) and sonicated eight times for 15-s bursts. The lysate was diluted to 1 ml in lysis buffer, and an aliquot (2%) was saved as input. Lysate was precleared sequentially with rabbit IgG and then protein A-agarose. Anti-p65 antibody, 2.5 μg, was added to the lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected by adding salmon sperm/protein A-agarose slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed once sequentially with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm, NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40), high salt wash (500 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0), and LiCl wash (250 mm LiCl, 1.0%, Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and then twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The beads were then treated with RNase (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min and proteinase K for overnight. Cross-links were reversed at 65 °C, and the DNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and coprecipitated with glycogen. DNA was dissolved in 25 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Real Time (Quantitative) PCR—Real time PCR assays were performed essentially as described previously (38Wang H. Yang L. Jamaluddin M.S. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22674-22683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The primers used in the reaction had a concentration of 100 nm. A threshold cycle (Ct) value was obtained from each amplification curve using the software provided by the manufacturer. A Ct value was calculated by subtracting the Ct value for the 2% input sample from the Ct value for the immunoprecipitated sample, i.e. ΔCt = Ct(input) – Ct(IP). The percentage of the total input amount for the immunoprecipitated sample was then calculated by raising 2 to the ΔCt power, i.e. the total percentage of immunoprecipitated sample = 2ΔCt × 2 as described previously. The following primers, corresponding to the human MMP-9 or COX-2 promoter sequence, were used for real time PCR: forward (5-TGTCCCTTTACTGCCCTGA-3), reverse (5-ACTCCAGGCTCTGTCCTCCTCTT-3) for MMP-9 promoter and forward (5-AAAGACATCTGGCGGAAACCT-3), reverse (5-AGGAAGCTGCCCCAATTTG-3) for Cox-2. These primers correspond to sequences –657/–638 and –484/–504 of the MMP-9 promoter or –434/–414 and –319/–337 of the COX-2 promoter, respectively. For conventional PCR, the identical primer pair was used with the following PCR cycle parameters: denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing and extension at 60 °C for 60 s, with a total of 40 cycles. To verify the amplicon size, PCR products were checked in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Cell Transfection—To introduce IκBα-DN or p65 plasmids, 3 × 105 cells were seeded, and 2 μg of plasmid was diluted in 200 ml of DMEM (without serum and antibiotics) and then mixed with 200 ml of DMEM containing 4 ml of LipofectAMINE 2000. This mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 12 h. After incubation, cells were washed and maintained for an additional 48 h before using for experiments. Immunocytochemistry for NF-κB p65 Localization—The effect of TNF on the nuclear translocation of p65 was examined by an immunocytochemical method as described (39Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4750-4759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, treated cells were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide by centrifugation using a cytospin 4 (Thermoshendon, Pittsburgh, PA), air-dried, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde following permeabilization with 0.2% Triton-X-100. After being washed in phosphate-buffered saline, slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human p65 antibody at a 1:100 dilution. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the slides were washed, incubated with goat antirabbit IgG-Alexa 594 at a 1:100 dilution for 1 h, and counter-stained for nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (50 ng/ml) for 5 min. Stained slides were mounted with mounting medium purchased from Sigma and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pictures were captured by using a Photometrics Coolsnap CF color camera (Nikon, Lewisville, TX) and MetaMorph version 4.6.5 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Cytotoxicity Assay—The cytotoxic effects of TNF were determined by the MTT uptake method as described (40Ashikawa K. Shishodia S. Fokt I. Priebe W. Aggarwal B.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 104 cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates, pretreated with 1 μg/ml cycloheximide, and then treated with various concentrations of TNF for 24 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, MTT solution was added to each well. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, extraction buffer (20% SDS, 50% dimethylformamide) was added, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm by using a 96-well multiscanner (Dynex Technologies, MRX Revelation, Chantilly, VA). Annexin V Assay—An early indicator of apoptosis is the rapid translocation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the cytoplasmic interface to the extracellular surface. This loss of membrane asymmetry can be detected by utilizing the binding properties of annexin V. To identify the apoptosis, we employed annexin V antibody, which conjugated with FITC fluorescence dye. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were pretreated with 1 μg/ml cycloheximide, treated with 1 nm TNF for 12 h at 37 °C, and subjected to annexin V staining. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing FITC-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody, and then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). TUNEL Assay—We also assayed cytotoxicity by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method, which examines DNA strand breaks during apoptosis, using the Roche Applied Science in situ cell death detection reagent. Briefly, 1 × 105cells were pretreated with 1 μg/ml cycloheximide and then treated with 1 nm TNF for 16 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide by centrifugation using a cytospin 4, air-dried, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. After being washed, cells were incubated with reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C. Stained cells were mounted with mounting medium purchased from Sigma and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2). Live and Dead Assay—To measure the apoptosis induced by TNF, we also used the Live and Dead assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which determines intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity. This assay employs calcein, a polyanionic dye, which is retained within live cells and produces a green fluorescence. It also employs the ethidium bromide homodimer dye (red fluorescence), which can enter cells through damaged membranes and bind to nucleic acids but is excluded from live cells by the intact plasma membrane. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were pretreated with 1 μg/ml cycloheximide and then treated with 1 nm TNF for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were stained with the Live and Dead® reagent (5 μm ethidium bromide homodimer, 5 μm calcein-AM) and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2). The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of GSK-3β on TNF signaling. This proinflammatory cytokine has been shown to activate NF-κB through IKK and to activate p44/p42 MAPK and apoptosis. To investigate the role of GSK-3β, we used wild-type murine fibroblasts (MEF) and GSK-3β gene-deleted fibroblasts (MEF/GSK-3β–/–). We first examined the expression of GSK-3β protein in both MEF and MEF/GSK-3β–/– by Western blot analysis. GSK-3β was expressed in wild-type MEF but not in GSK-3β–/– MEF (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, as revealed by Western blot analysis, both TNF receptor 1 and TNF receptor 2 were expressed equally in both cell lines (Fig. 1B). GSK-3β Is Required for TNF-dependent NF-κB Activation—We first examined the effect of GSK-3β deletion on TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Cells were stimulated with TNF, prepared the nuclear extracts, and analyzed them for NF-κB activation by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 1C, TNF induced NF-κB activation in a time-dependent manner in wile-type fibroblasts but abrogated its activation in GSK-3β–/– fibroblasts. Because activation of NF-κB by TNF is more robust at higher concentrations (41Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we determined the effect of GSK-3β deletion on NF-κB activation induced by higher concentrations of TNF (Fig. 1D). At a concentration of 10 nm TNF activated NF-κB activity stronglyin in wild-type cells but not in GSK-3β–/– cells. These results show that GSK-3β is required for TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Lithium Chloride Suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB Activation—Lithium ions have been shown to inhibit GSK-3α and -3β both in vitro and in intact cells (42Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of lithium chloride (LiCl) on TNF-induced NF-κB activation, we pretreated cells with LiCl and then stimulated them with TNF, and we analyzed the nuclear extract by EMSA. KCl and NaCl were used as control. As shown in Fig. 2A, LiCl suppressed TNF-induced NF-κB activation, but KCl and NaCl did not. These results suggest that the activity of GSK-3β is required for suppression of NF-κB. GSK-3β Is Required for NF-κB Activation Induced by LPS, IL-1β, or Cigarette Smoke Condensate—NF-κB is activated by a wide variety of carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli other than TNF, through a mechanism that may differ from that of TNF (43Garg A.

https://openalex.org/W1969086578,"The Group VIA Phospholipase A2 (iPLA2β) is the first recognized cytosolic Ca2+-independent PLA2 and has been proposed to participate in arachidonic acid (20:4) incorporation into glycerophosphocholine lipids, cell proliferation, exocytosis, apoptosis, and other processes. To study iPLA2β functions, we disrupted its gene by homologous recombination to generate mice that do not express iPLA2β. Heterozygous iPLA2β+/– breeding pairs yield a Mendelian 1:2:1 ratio of iPLA2β+/+, iPLA2β+/–, and iPLA2β–/– pups and a 1:1 male:female gender distribution of iPLA2β–/– pups. Several tissues of wild-type mice express iPLA2β mRNA, immunoreactive protein, and activity, and testes express the highest levels. Testes or other tissues of iPLA2β–/– mice express no iPLA2β mRNA or protein, but iPLA2β–/– testes are not deficient in 20:4-containing glycerophosphocholine lipids, indicating that iPLA2β does not play an obligatory role in formation of such lipids in that tissue. Spermatozoa from iPLA2β–/– mice have reduced motility and impaired ability to fertilize mouse oocytes in vitro and in vivo, and inhibiting iPLA2β with a bromoenol lactone suicide substrate reduces motility of wild-type spermatozoa in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Mating iPLA2β–/– male mice with iPLA2β+/+, iPLA2β+/–, or iPLA2β–/– female mice yields only about 7% of the number of pups produced by mating pairs with an iPLA2β+/+ or iPLA2β+/– male, but iPLA2β–/– female mice have nearly normal fertility. These findings indicate that iPLA2β plays an important functional role in spermatozoa, suggest a target for developing male contraceptive drugs, and complement reports that disruption of the Group IVA PLA2 (cPLA2α) gene impairs female reproductive ability.

Arachidonic acid (20:4), for example, is converted by various oxygenases to prostaglandins, leukotrienes, epoxy-trienes, and other mediators, and acetylation of 2-lysoplasmanylcholine yields the mediator platelet-activating factor (3Murphy R.C. Fitzpatrick F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 1-628Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both 20:4 and 2-lysophospholipids also have intrinsic mediator activities (4Brash A.R. J. Clin.

Of mammalian PLA2s so far cloned, secretory PLA2s are low molecular weight enzymes that require millimolar Ca2+ concentrations for catalysis and affect eicosanoid generation, inflammation, and other processes (1Six D.

The platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase PLA2 family exhibits substrate specificity for platelet-activating factor and oxidized phospholipids. Of Group IV cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) family members (1Six D. Dennis E. Biochim. Biophys.

The Group VIA PLA2 (iPLA2β) resides mainly in the cytoplasm of resting cells, but the Group VIB PLA2 (iPLA2γ) contains a peroxisomal targeting sequence and is membrane-associated (11Mancuso D. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Many cells express multiple distinct PLA2s, and this might reflect redundancy or specific functions of an individual PLA2. Physiological roles for PLA2s can be studied with genetic gain- or loss-of-function manipulations. Overexpressing iPLA2β in insulinoma cells, for example, provides evidence for its participation in exocytosis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (12Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Wohltmann M. Bohrer A. Hsu F.F.

We have used homologous recombination to generate iPLA2β-null mice. Among various tissues, testes of wild-type mice express the highest iPLA2β levels, and male iPLA2β–/– mice produce spermatozoa with reduced motility and impaired ability to fertilize mouse oocytes in vitro and in vivo. Male iPLA2β–/– mice are also much less fertile than wild-type males, but female iPLA2β–/– mouse fertility is not markedly impaired. Our findings indicate that iPLA2β–/– plays an important functional role in spermatozoa. Generating iPLA2–/–Knockout Mice—To prepare a knockout construct, we obtained a P1 clone with an iPLA2β gene fragment by screening a 129/SvJ mouse genomic DNA library with rat iPLA2β cDNA (8Ma Z.

The 7.8-kb EcoRV-BglII fragment containing exons 7–10 was subcloned into pBluescript SK–. A single XhoI site mapped to exon 9 near sequence encoding the 463GTSTG467 lipase motif. A pGK-neo-poly(A) cassette with a neomycin resistance gene (neo) was inserted at this site to disrupt iPLA2β coding sequence and provide a positive selection marker. A pGK-thymidine kinase gene was inserted into the BglII site of the genomic fragment as a negative selection marker. This yielded a vector with 4.1 and 3.7 kb of the 5′ and 3′ sequences, respectively, homologous to the native gene for recombination. The targeting fragment was excised with EcoRV and BglII and introduced into 129/SvJ mouse embryonic stem cells by electroporation. Clones resistant to G418 and ganciclovir were isolated and screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting of genomic DNA digested with EcoRV. Six embryonic stem clones contained 6.7-kb fragments characteristic of iPLA2β gene disruption and, as expected, 8.7-kb fragments from the wild-type allele. The clones were injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts, which were implanted for gestation to yield chimeras that were mated with wild-type mice to yield heterozygotes. Mating iPLA2β+/– mice with each other gave iPLA2β–/–, iPLA2β–/+, and iPLA2β+/+ pups. Mice were genotyped with Southern blots of tail clipping genomic DNA digested with EcoRV using a 32P-labeled probe prepared by PCR amplification or restriction endonuclease digestion with EcoRV and BglII to yield an 0.95-kb fragment located downstream of the targeting sequence. This probe hybridizes with an 8.7-kb DNA fragment in iPLA2β+/+ mice, with a 6.7-kb fragment in iPLA2β–/– mice, and with both in iPLA2β+/– mice (see Fig. 1D). The iPLA2β gene-targeting sequence inserts a new EcoRV site in genomic DNA to yield a fragment that hybridizes with the probe that is shorter than that from wild-type genomic DNA. Northern and Western Blot Analyses—As described (8Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), tissue total RNA analyzed by electrophoresis was transferred to nylon membranes that were hybridized with iPLA2β cDNA probes labeled by random priming. The iPLA2β cDNA probe was amplified using reverse transcription-PCR (sense primer, 5′-TGTGACGTGGACAGCACTAGC; antisense primer, 5′-CCCCAGAGAAACGACTATGGA), which hybridizes to both short and long isoforms of iPLA2β (2Ma Z. Turk J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 67: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This region of cDNA represents the sequence that encodes amino acid residues 307–552 of the short isoform of iPLA2β. A final stringency wash was followed by autoradiography, and the filters were then stripped and hybridized with cDNA probes to rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to mark RNA load (8Ma Z.

Western blotting was performed as described with tissue homogenates and iPLA2β antibody that had been raised in rabbits (12Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Wohltmann M. Bohrer A. Hsu F.F. Turk J. J. Biol.

Ca2+-independent Phospholipase A2 Activity Assay—Tissue Ca2+-independent PLA2 specific activity was determined as described (8Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol.

Specific activity was calculated from released [14C]disintegrations/min and protein content. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry of Lipids—Tissue lipids were extracted and infused into the ESI source of a triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer in CHCl3/CH3OH containing LiOH, as described (17Hsu F.F.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4533-4567Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) lipids and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were analyzed as [M+Li]+ ions. Seminolipid and glycerol-, inositol-, and ethanolamine-glycerophospholipids and phosphatidic acids were analyzed as [M-H]– ions. Tandem spectra were obtained by accelerating selected ions into a collision cell to induce dissociation, and product ions were analyzed in the third quadrupole. Internal standards, e.g. 14:0/14:0-GPC, were used for quantitation. Analyses of Motility of Spermatozoa and Effect of the iPLA2β Inhibitor BEL—Male mice 8–10 weeks old were euthanized with pentobarbital in a protocol approved by our Animal Studies Committee. Caudae epididymides, and the vasa deferentia were removed and placed in prewarmed and pregassed human tubal fluid medium (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA). Morphology and viability of spermatozoa were assessed as described (20Esposito G. Jaiswal B. Xie F. Krajnc-Franken M. Robben T. Strik A. Kuil C. Philipsen R. van Duin M. Conti M. Gossen J. Proc.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 665-675PubMed Google Scholar), did not differ between iPLA2β+/+ and iPLA2β–/– mice, and were unaffected by BEL. Sperm suspension was placed in an incubation chamber (37 °C), and motility was quantified using CEROS computer-assisted semen analyses (version 10; Hamilton Thorne Research, Beverly, MA), as discussed (23Moley K.H. Vaughn W.K. DeCherney A.H. Diamond M.P. J. Reprod. Fert. 1991; 93: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Total and progressive motilities were analyzed in about 104 spermatozoa from each genotype. A swim-up motility assay was also used that involved centrifugation, incubation (1 h, 37 °C), and counting spermatozoa that migrated into supernatant, as described (22Schwartz D. Goldfinger N. Kam Z. Rotter V. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 665-675PubMed Google Scholar). Spermatozoa were treated in some cases with various concentrations of BEL (0–20 μm), and motility was analyzed after various periods (0–30 min). In Vitro Fertilization Assay—Female mice about 30 days old were injected with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (7.5 IU intraperitoneally) and 48 h later were injected with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 7.5 IU intraperitoneally), as discussed (24Miller D. Gong X. Decker G. Schur B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Oviducts were collected 13 h later, and the oocyte cumulus complexes were removed. One or two complexes were placed in a culture dish (100 mm, 50 μl minimum essential medium, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin; Sigma), and droplets were covered by embryo-tested mineral oil (Sigma). Spermatozoa collected from cauda epididymis were allowed to swim into minimum essential medium (10 min, 37 °C), aspirated, incubated (37 °C, 60 min, 5% CO2, 4 × 106/ml) to permit capacitation, diluted, and added to oocyte droplets to achieve a concentration of 105 or 106 spermatozoa/ml. Spermatozoa and oocytes were co-incubated (5–24 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2). Oocytes and zygotes were passed through a pipette to remove cumulus cells, fixed (1% paraformaldehyde), placed on a microscope slide with affixed coverslip, treated with acetic acid/ethanol (1/3 v/v, 2 min), stained (1% lacmoid/45% acetic acid), destained (45% acetic acid), and examined for oocyte fertilization reflected by a second polar body and two pronuclei with one near a sperm tail (24Miller D. Gong X. Decker G. Schur B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In Vivo Fertilization Assay—Superovulation of 6–8-week-old female mice was induced by injecting pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (10 IU, intraperitoneally; Sigma) and, after 48 h, hCG (10 IU, intraperitoneal, Sigma), as described (21Hagaman J. Moyer J. Bachman E. Sigony S. Magyar P. Welch J. Smithies O. Krege J. O'Brien D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2252-2257Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Schwartz D. Goldfinger N.

Those mice were then mated with iPLA2β+/+ or iPLA2β–/– males overnight, and, after 48 h, the mice were euthanized with pentobarbital according to a protocol approved by our Animal Studies Committee. Dissected uterine horns were flushed with human tubal fluid medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) to retrieve one- and two-cell structures, which were then counted and cultured (human tubal fluid with 0.25% bovine serum albumin media microdroplets under mineral oil, 37 °C, 5% CO2) for 72 h. The blastocyst embryos were then counted. Fertility Tests—Male mice were placed with females for 6 weeks and then removed, and the pups were counted, as described (21Hagaman J. Moyer J. Bachman E. Sigony S. Magyar P. Welch J. Smithies O. Krege J. O'Brien D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2252-2257Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Females mated with iPLA2β–/– males had a normal frequency of vaginal semen plugs, determined as described (25Schuh K. Cartwright E.J. Jankevics E. Bundschu K. Liebermann J. Williams J.C.

Statistical Analyses—Comparisons between two groups or among three or more groups were performed with Student's t test or with analysis of variance using posthoc analysis (Statview 4.51, Abacus), respectively. Generation of iPLA2β-null Mice—Fig. 1 illustrates our scheme to generate mice with a disrupted iPLA2β gene and to determine their genotypes. An iPLA2β gene-targeting construct was introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells, and those that incorporated it by homologous recombination, which disrupts the iPLA2β gene coding sequence (Fig. 1B), were introduced into mouse blastocysts that were then implanted into pseudo-pregnant female mice. Progeny included chimeras, which were mated with wild-type mice, and litters included iPLA2β+/– mice, reflecting iPLA2β– allele germ-line transmission. Mating pairs of iPLA2β+/– mice yielded iPLA2β+/+, iPLA2β+/–, and iPLA2β–/– pups in a nearly Mendelian 1:2:1 distribution with a 1:1 male/female gender distribution (Table I).Table IDistribution of genotypes and genders in offspring from mating male iPLA2β+/-heterozygous mice with female heterozygous iPLA2β+/-miceGenotypeTotal no. of pupsGenderNo. of pupsiPLA2β+/+31Male13Female18iPLA2β+/-72Male35Female37iPLA2β-/-35Male17Female18 Open table in a new tab Northern blots revealed that wild-type mouse testes iPLA2β mRNA content exceeds that of muscle, pancreas, kidney, liver, brain, heart, adipose, and epididymis (Fig. 2A). No iPLA2β mRNA was detected in testes or other tissues of iPLA2β–/– mice. Western blots also revealed high iPLA2β protein expression in wild-type testes, but no iPLA2β protein was detected in iPLA2β–/– testes or spermatozoa (Fig. 2B). The highest level of Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity is also observed in the testes of wild-type mice (Fig. 3A), and, as characteristic of iPLA2β (10Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Hu Z. Turk J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1391: 384-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Mancuso D. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

Testes and other tissues of iPLA2β–/– mice exhibit much less total Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity than wild-type mouse tissues (Fig. 3A), suggesting that iPLA2β is ordinarily the major tissue Ca2+-independent PLA2 and that there is little up-regulation of other Ca2+-independent PLA2s, such as cPLA2γ and iPLA2γ (1Six D. Dennis E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 2Ma Z. Turk J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 67: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), to compensate for the loss of iPLA2β. Effect of iPLA2β Gene Disruption on Tissue Content of Arachidonic Acid-containing Phosphatidylcholine and Other Lipids—Studies of [3H8]arachidonic acid incorporation into P388D1 tumor cells have been taken to imply that the function of iPLA2β is to generate lysophosphatidylcholine acceptors for arachidonic acid (20:4) incorporation into GPC lipids (26Balsinde J. Bianco I. Ackermann E. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and it might thus be expected that iPLA2β–/– mouse tissues would be deficient in 20:4-containing GPC lipids. The lipids were extracted from wild-type and iPLA2β–/– mouse testes and analyzed by ESI/MS in the presence of LiOH. Fig. 4A is the ESI/MS positive total ion current spectrum for a lipid extract from wild-type mouse testes, and it contains ions with even m/z values for Li+ adducts (17Hsu F.F. Bohrer A. Turk J. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1998; 9: 516-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) of internal standard (m/z 684) dimyristoyl-GPC (14:0/14:0-GPC) and of endogenous 16:0/18:1-GPC (m/z 766) and the 20:4-containing species 16:0/20:4-GPC (m/z 788) and 18:1/20:4-GPC (m/z 814). The spectrum also contains odd m/z value ions for Li+ adducts of sphingomyelins (e.g. 16:0-sphingomyelin at m/z 709) and of TAGs (18Hsu F.F. Turk J. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1999; 10: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) with various fatty acid substituents (e.g. m/z 837, 863, and 889). Fig. 4C illustrates the tandem spectrum that identifies the species represented by the ion of m/z 788 as 16:0/20:4-GPC (20Esposito G. Jaiswal B. Xie F. Krajnc-Franken M. Robben T. Strik A. Kuil C. Philipsen R. van Duin M. Conti M. Gossen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2993-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and it contains ions for losses of trimethylamine (m/z 729), of phosphocholine (m/z 605), of Li+ phosphocholine (m/z 599), of palmitic acid (16:0, m/z 532), of Li+ 16:0 (m/z 526), of 20:4 (m/z 484), of Li+ 20:4 (m/z 478), of 16:0 plus trimethylamine (m/z 473), of the ketene of 20:4 plus Li+ phosphocholine (m/z 313), and 16:0 acylium ion (m/z 239). Fig. 4D illustrates tandem spectra that identify TAG Li+ adducts (18Hsu F.F. Turk J. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1999; 10: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), such as that of the ion of m/z 863 for 16:0/18:1/18:2-TAG-Li+ that contains ions reflecting losses of 16:0 (m/z 607), of Li+ 16:0 (m/z 601), of oleic acid (18:1, m/z 581), of Li+ 18:1 (m/z 575), of linoleic acid (18:2, m/z 583), and of Li+ 18:2 (m/z 577). Incomplete exchange of Li+ for Na+ on occasion resulted in satellite peaks in some TAG spectra (e.g. m/z 853, 879, and 905 in Fig. 4B) that did not occur in others (Fig. 4A). The ESI/MS spectrum for Li+ adducts of iPLA2β–/– mouse testes lipids (Fig. 4B) is nearly identical to that for iPLA2β+/+ mice (Fig. 4A), and abundances of ions for 20:4-containing GPC lipids (m/z 788 and m/z 814) relative to the internal standard (m/z 684) are virtually identical in panels A and B of Fig. 4, indicating that iPLA2β–/– mouse testes are not deficient in 20:4-containing GPC lipids. Negative ion ESI/MS analyses (19Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Bohrer A. Nowatzke W. Ma Z. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4533-4567Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) of testes lipids reveal 20:4-containing glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphoinositol lipids, e.g. 18:0/20:4-glycerophosphoethanolamine and 18:0/20:4-glycerophosphoinositol, and other lipid species. Negative ion ESI/MS spectra for iPLA2β–/– and iPLA2β+/+ testes lipids are also nearly identical (not shown). Lack of iPLA2β thus has little effect on testes phospholipid composition or 20:4-content, and iPLA2β–/– and iPLA2β+/+ testes also do not differ in gross or microscopic anatomy or weight. Motility of Spermatozoa from Wild-type and iPLA2β–/–Mice—Although there is a modest reduction in number of spermatozoa produced by iPLA2β–/– mice (1.5 ± 0.4 × 107/mouse) compared with wild-type mice (3.4 ± 0.7 × 107/mouse), there is a marked reduction in motility of iPLA2β–/– mouse spermatozoa. Fig. 5A summarizes swim-up motility analyses and illustrates that motility of spermatozoa from iPLA2β–/– mice is less than 5% of that of spermatozoa from iPLA2β+/+ or iPLA2β+/– mice. Fig. 5B illustrates computer-assisted spermatozoa analyses of motility and also demonstrates reduced motility of spermatozoa from iPLA2β–/– compared with iPLA2β+/+ or iPLA2β+/– mice. Effect of Inhibiting iPLA2β Activity with a BEL Suicide Substrate on Motility of Spermatozoa—To examine further the role of iPLA2β in motility, suspensions of spermatozoa were treated with varied concentrations of the iPLA2β inhibitor BEL (9Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Hu Z. Turk J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1391: 384-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for various intervals, and motility of spermatozoa was determined. BEL reduced motility of spermatozoa in a concentration- and time-dependent manner at [BEL] as low as 5 μm (Fig. 6A) and at times as early as 5 min (Fig. 6B). In Vitro Fertilization of Mouse Oocytes—The reduced motility of iPLA2β–/– spermatozoa suggested that they might be impaired functionally. Fig. 7A illustrates that wild-type spermatozoa exhibit a concentration-dependent ability to fertilize oocytes from wild-type female mice in vitro, but spermatozoa from iPLA2β–/– mice achieved fertilization only about 5% as often as wild-type spermatozoa at the highest concentration tested, indicating that iPLA2β–/– spermatozoa are functionally impaired. In Vivo Fertilization of Mouse Oocytes—Fertilization experiments in vivo were performed by inducing wild-type female mice to ovulate by treatment with injected pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and hCG. They were then mated with control male mice of normal reproductive competence or with iPLA2β–/– male mice. Products from oocytes were recovered from the uterus, and it was determined whether fertilization had occurred and whether there had been subsequent development of blastocysts. Fig. 7B illustrates that when female mice were mated with control, reproductively competent male mice, 84 two-cell structures were observed by 48 h after hCG injection, and 86% of them later developed into blastocysts. In contrast, when female mice were mated with iPLA2β–/– male mice, only 2 two-cell structures were observed by 48 h after hCG injection, and neither developed into a blastocyst (Fig. 7B). Both in vitro (Fig. 7A) and in vivo (Fig. 7B) fertilization experiments thus demonstrate functional impairment of spermatozoa from iPLA2β–/– mice.

https://openalex.org/W2141361924,"The formation of native disulfide bonds is an essential event in the folding and maturation of proteins entering the secretory pathway. For native disulfides to form efficiently an oxidative pathway is required for disulfide bond formation and a reductive pathway is required to ensure isomerization of non-native disulfide bonds. The oxidative pathway involves the oxidation of substrate proteins by PDI, which in turn is oxidized by endoplasmic reticulum oxidase (Ero1). Here we demonstrate that overexpression of Ero1 results in the acceleration of disulfide bond formation and correct protein folding. In contrast, lowering the levels of glutathione within the cell resulted in acceleration of disulfide bond formation but did not lead to correct protein folding. These results demonstrate that lowering the level of glutathione in the cell compromises the reductive pathway and prevents disulfide bond isomerization from occurring efficiently, highlighting the crucial role played by glutathione in native disulfide bond formation within the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.

The compartmentalization of the ER away from the cytosol allows the correct redox conditions to be established (1Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), which in turn enables a distinct set of folding catalysts to facilitate the formation of native disulfide bonds. A growing family of ER oxidoreductases is thought to be responsible for catalyzing the formation, isomerization, and reduction of disulfide bonds (2Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). These oxidoreductases contain active sites homologous to the active site found in the cytosolic reductase thioredoxin, characterized by a pair of cysteine residues (CXXC) that shuttle between the disulfide and dithiol form (3Ferrari D.M. Soling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The reactions that these enzymes catalyze require the individual active sites to be maintained in either the oxidized disulfide form, for disulfide bond formation, or the reduced dithiol form, for isomerization or reduction of disulfide bonds (4Freedman R.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). How the active sites are maintained in either their reduced or oxidized state and how the ER maintains an environment conducive to disulfide bond formation, isomerization, and reduction has been the subject of intense speculation over the past 40 years (5Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 6Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Recently, components of the oxidative pathway have been identified, however, we know very little about the reductive pathway even though it is clear that disulfide bond isomerization and reduction are essential for cell viability (7Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is now firmly established that the oxidoreductase PDI catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds within the eukaryotic ER (8Holst B. Tachibana C. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). During disulfide bond formation an intrachain disulfide bond between the cysteine residues within the active site is able to accept two electrons from the polypeptide chain substrate resulting in the reduction of the PDI active site. Ero1p has been shown to be responsible for the oxidation of PDI in yeast, a defect in Ero1p leads to a lack of disulfide bond formation demonstrating the crucial role played by Ero1p in the oxidative folding pathway (5Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 6Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence to suggest that Ero1p is an FAD-dependent oxidase that is able to pass electrons from PDI to the ultimate electron acceptor oxygen (10Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, Ero1p can also catalyze the oxidation of PDI under anaerobic conditions suggesting the possibility that alternative electron acceptors could substitute for oxygen under these conditions (11Sevier C.S. Cuozzo J.W. Vala A. Aslund F. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although a clear mechanism exists to oxidize PDI, in mammalian cells most of the ER oxidoreductases, including PDI appear to be in a predominantly reduced form at steady state (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This would suggest that a pathway exists to maintain these proteins in a reduced state within the cell. That PDI is predominantly reduced in mammalian cells contrasts with the situation in yeast where PDI is clearly predominantly oxidized (9Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The yeast ER maybe more oxidizing than the mammalian ER explaining this discrepancy; however, despite the differences it is clear that PDI in mammalian cells can be oxidized by Ero1 and catalyzes disulfide bond formation (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). At least one other ER oxidoreductases, ERp57, does not appear to be a substrate for Ero1 as judged by a lack of oxidation in cells overexpressing Ero1 (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). ERp57 has also been shown to act as a reductase, at least in vitro, to allow the breaking of non-native disulfide bonds within MHC-class I heavy chain (13Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Alphey M. Osborne A. Elliott T. Powis S.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hence there is a requirement for both an oxidative pathway for disulfide bond formation and a reductive pathway to allow reduction and isomerization of non-native disulfides and for these pathways to co-exist in the same intracellular compartment. The mechanism for maintaining ER oxidoreductases in a reduced state could involve a protein-mediated process such as exists in the Escherichia coli periplasm where DsbD maintains the main enzyme catalyzing disulfide isomerization DsbC in a reduced state (14Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Alternatively a glutathione buffer may be involved, eliminating the requirement for a separate protein-mediated pathway for their reduction. Maintaining a pool of GSH within the ER could be brought about by continuous transport from the cytosol where glutathione reductase maintains a high concentration of GSH. Indeed some evidence exists to suggest the presence of a transport system that allows the selective passage of GSH rather than GSSG (15Banhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskas F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Also, elimination of glutathione from yeast cells by removal of the enzyme involved in the first step of synthesis, γglutamylcysteine synthetase, did not prevent disulfide bond formation but did render the cells more prone to hyperoxidation, suggesting a direct or indirect role for glutathione in maintaining a redox balance in the yeast ER (16Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Hence the possibility remains that reduction of ER oxidoreductases can be bought about either directly by glutathione or by a separate enzyme catalyzed pathway. To address this point we have chosen to study the folding and disulfide bond formation of human tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA). This protein contains 17 disulfide bonds and is secreted from recombinant cell lines as a mixture of two glycoforms that differ in their extent of core N-linked glycosylation. We have previously shown that conditions preventing disulfide bond formation, such as addition of the reducing agent DTT to culture medium of living cells, lead to complete glycosylation of a sequon that would otherwise undergo variable glycosylation in untreated cells (17Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4797-4804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The extent of glycosylation of tPA is therefore intimately linked to the rate of protein folding and disulfide bond formation. The close temporal relationship between glycosylation and folding of tPA allows us to evaluate the affect of altering the redox conditions on both the rate of disulfide bond formation and also the rate of protein folding. Here we present evidence establishing that a rate-limiting step in the oxidative pathway and protein folding is the oxidation of PDI. We also show that a high concentration of intracellular glutathione is required to ensure the formation of native disulfide bonds. Cell Lines and Treatment—tPA-expressing CHO cells (ATCC CRL-9606) were cultured in HAM F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (tissue culture media and supplements obtained from Invitrogen) plus appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C. In the buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, Sigma) experiments, 0.5 mm BSO was added to the media 6 h after seeding. Cells were cultured in the presence of BSO for 16 h. During the cell labeling experiments with cells cultured in the presence of BSO, 0.5 mm BSO was added to the starve, pulse, and chase media. Generation of Stable Transfected Cell Lines—pcDNA3.1-ERO1-Lαmyc vector, a kind gift from Prof. Roberto Sitia (San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy), was linearized with SmaI and transfected into tPA-expressing CHO cells using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, 2 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed together with various amounts of FuGENE-6, incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and added in a dropwise manner to 6 × 104 CHO cells maintained in 6-well dishes. 48 h after transfection, cells from each well were seeded into 150-mm dishes in the selection medium, which consisted of growth medium containing 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). The cells were grown in the selection medium for 2-3 weeks, and the neomycin-resistant clones were selected. The stably transfected cells were maintained in the selection growth medium and overexpression of Ero1-Lαmyc was examined by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on coverslips to 50-70% confluency, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in methanol for 10 min at -20 °C followed by a brief rehydration with PBS. Cells were stained with primary antibodies, mouse anti-c-Myc hybridoma supernatant, clone 9E10 (Sigma) and rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (Stressgen Bioreagents), diluted in PBS, for 20 min. After three 5-min washes in PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 594 Donkey anti-mouse antibody and Alexa Fluor 448 Donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes Inc.), diluted in PBS for 20 min, followed by four 5-min washes in PBS. DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). All the incubations were carried out at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted onto slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem) containing 25 mg/ml DABCO (Sigma) as an anti-fade agent. Slides were viewed on a Leica confocal microscope, and images captured using a charge-coupled camera. Western Blotting—The proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically from the gels onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked in TTBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% w/v NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 80) containing 3% (w/v) milk followed by incubation for 1 h in the primary antibody, rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-PDI antibody (31John D.C. Grant M.E. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), diluted to 1:500 in TTBS buffer. Blots were then washed three times for 10 min each in TTBS and incubated with 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (DAKO), in TTBS, for 1 h. After washing three times for 10 min each in TTBS, the membranes were treated with Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) for 5 min. All incubations were carried out at room temperature, and the proteins were visualized by exposure to Fuji Medical x-ray film. Radiolabeling and Immunoisolation—For pulse-chase experiments, 2 × 106 cells per 6-cm dish were washed twice with prewarmed methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), and then preincubated in the same medium for 20 min at 37 °C. Each monolayer was pulse-labeled with 50 μCi of 35S-EXPRESS (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min at 37 °C and then chased with excess of methionine and cysteine. DTT was added in the pulse-chase medium, where indicated. 0.5 mm cycloheximide (Sigma) was included in the chase medium to block completion of labeled nascent chains. At the end of the labeling period or chase times, the cells were transferred to ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma) to minimize disulfide bond rearrangements. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NEM) for 10 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material and incubated overnight with goat anti-human tPA polyclonal antibody (Cambio) or mouse anti-human tPA monoclonal antibody (American Diagnostica Inc.) and protein GSepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). To monitor secretion of tPA, chase media from the radiolabeled cells were collected at the indicated times and immunoisolated with monoclonal or polyclonal tPA antibodies. Immune complexes were washed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and solubilized in 50 μl of sample buffer (0.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 20% v/v glycerol, 0.004% w/v bromphenol blue). DTT (50 mm) was added to reduced samples where indicated. All samples, reduced and non-reduced, were boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by either autoradiography using Kodak Biomax MR film or phosphorimager analysis using a Fuji Film Bas 1800 phosphorimager. Glutathione Assays—Total glutathione levels were measured using the DTNB (5, 5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), Sigma)-GSSG reductase recycling assay (32Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). CHO cells (2 × 106) were harvested by trypsinization, and the cell pellet was lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold 8 mm HCl/1.3% 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA, Sigma) by agitating with glass beads. The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min. Glass beads, precipitated protein, and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Total glutathione was measured by adding 10 μl of the lysate to 1-ml assay mixture prewarmed to 30 °C in a spectrophotometer cuvette. GSSG reductase was then added with mixing to initiate the assay and change in absorbance at 405 nm was measured over 4 min. Standard curves were generated using 0.5-4 nmol of GSH solubilized in 8 mm HCl/1.3% SSA. PDI Redox State—The in vivo redox state of PDI was assayed by modification with the thiol-reactive reagent acetamido-maleimidylstilbene-disulfonic acid AMS (Molecular Probes). Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with or without DTT (5 mm) or 4,4′dithiodipyridine (0.5 mm). At the end of the incubation period, the cells were transferred to ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 20 mm NEM to minimize disulfide bond rearrangements. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (without NEM) for 10 min on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material. The supernantant was transferred into a fresh tube and 1% SDS and 10 mm TCEP was added to all the samples. Samples were boiled for 2 min, cooled, and treated with 25 mm AMS for 60 min at room temperature, in the dark. Overexpression of Ero1-Lα Leads to Enhanced Oxidative Protein Folding—Our initial studies focused on the consequence of overexpressing Ero1 on the ability of tPA to form disulfide bonds, fold correctly and be secreted. Our approach was to generate stable cell lines expressing both t-PA and wild-type Ero1 or Ero1 containing single cysteine point mutations known to compromise function (18Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A CHO cell line expressing tPA (CHO-tPA) was transfected with Myc-tagged Ero1-Lα and stable cell lines selected. Isolated cell lines were screened for expression of Ero1 by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4). To assess the oxidation state of the transfected Ero1-Lα, cells were treated with the membrane permeable alkylating agent NEM, to block free thiol groups and prevent rearrangement of disulfide bonds. Analysis of the cell lysate by electrophoresis carried out under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1A, lanes 5-8), revealed that the Myc-tagged exogenously expressed Ero1-Lα migrated with a greater mobility than when reduced prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 5). The increased mobility indicates the formation of intrachain disulfide bonds as previously described for the endogenous protein (19Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some higher molecular weight bands can also be seen when the cell lysate was separated under non-reducing conditions. These higher molecular weight bands are likely to be mixed disulfides between exogenously expressed Ero1-Lα and endogenous PDI, as characterized previously (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). No such high molecular weight bands were seen with either cysteine mutants demonstrating their inability to form functional mixed disulfides with PDI (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 7). These results demonstrate that the wild-type Ero1-Lα expressed in the CHO cells has folded correctly and is functional as indicated by its ability to form intrachain disulfides and mixed disulfides with other known ER oxidoreductases. The intracellular location of exogenously expressed Ero1-Lα protein in the stably transfected CHO-tPA cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were stained with a mixture of anti-Myc antibody and antibody to an ER resident protein, calnexin. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red) or Alexa Fluor 488 (green) dyes, to enable double labeling and to visualize Ero1-Lα and calnexin in the same cells. A characteristic ER reticular appearance for calnexin was visualized in cells. Overlay images of Myc with calnexin immunofluorescence showed co-localization of the protein with calnexin indicating that transfected Ero1-Lα is localized in the ER (Fig. 1B). In order to investigate the effect of overexpression of Ero1-Lα on the extent of glycosylation of tPA, untransfected (UT), and Ero1-Lα transfected (Ero1) stable CHO-tPA cells were radiolabeled for 10 min in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of DTT in the labeling medium. The cells were treated with NEM, the cells lysed and the tPA immunoisolated with a goat polyclonal antibody specific for tPA. The immunoisolated proteins were subjected to both reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, A and B). In the untransfected CHO-tPA cells, the tPA synthesized during the 10-min labeling period in the absence of DTT migrated as a doublet when reduced prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 2A, upper panel UT, lane 1) indicating that variable glycosylation had occurred. When subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, upper panel UT, lane 1) tPA migrated with a greater mobility and with a more diffuse pattern than on reducing gels, indicating that during the 10 min labeling period in the absence of DTT, the tPA had formed intrachain disulfide bonds. As the concentration of DTT in the labeling medium was increased from 0 to 5 mm, the doublet progressively disappeared until only a single band of the over-glycosylated tPA was present at concentrations of DTT above 0.75 mm (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-10). This change in migration was accompanied by a progressive reduction in the formation of disulfide bonds as indicated by the slower migrating sharper bands under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-10). Thus, at 1 mm DTT no disulfide bonds were formed as no faster migrating protein was seen when the sample was run under non-reducing conditions. In addition the reduction of proteins within the cell with higher concentrations of DTT also caused a slight decrease in mobility of the protein when run under reducing conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 8-10). This is due to full alkylation by NEM of the 34 cysteine residues in tPA when the protein is reduced and is a further indication of the lack of disulfide bond formation at these concentrations of DTT. In the cell line overexpressing Ero1-Lα the tPA synthesized was more resistant to the effects of reduction with DTT. This resistance is apparent both by the presence of variably glycosylated tPA at DTT concentrations as high as 1 mm and a lack of full reduction of disulfide bonds at 2 mm DTT (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Hence overexpression of Ero1 leads to formation of disulfide bonds at higher DTT concentrations indicating that Ero1 can act as an oxidase and can function in the presence of reducing agents. Additionally the ability to form disulfide bonds corresponds to an ability to also fold into a conformation that restricts glycosylation at higher concentrations of DTT, again highlighting the intimate link between disulfide bond formation and protein folding. The ability of cysteine mutants of Ero1 to bring about a similar effect was also investigated. Mammalian Ero1 contains 14 cysteine residues of which three (Cys-391, -394, and -397) have been shown, by single point mutation, to be involved in either stabilization of structure or enzymatic function (12Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An analysis of single cysteine mutations has also been carried out with yeast Ero1 and four cysteine residues (Cys-100, Cys-105, Cys-352, and Cys-355) were found to be absolutely required for function (18Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These correspond to Cys-99, Cys-104, Cys-394, and Cys-397 in the human protein. We created two Ero1 cysteine mutants with mutation in cys-99 or both cys-99 and cys-394 and prepared separate stable cell lines expressing these proteins (Fig. 1A). Both the cell line expressing Ero1-cys99 (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panel), and the cell line expressing Ero1-cys99/394 (data not shown) decreased the ability of the cells to resist the effect of DTT on disulfide bond formation. At 0.1 mm DTT there was no disulfide bond formation and the synthesized tPA was fully glycosylated (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 2). This result demonstrates that the effect on disulfide bond formation by reducing agent was a direct consequence of overexpression of Ero1 and not due to other pleiotropic effects such as the induction of another protein involved in disulfide bond formation. Ero1-Lα Accelerates Oxidative Folding of Correctly Folded tPA in the Mammalian ER—The previous experiments highlighted the role of Ero1 in facilitating disulfide bond formation in the presence of reducing agents. However these results do not address whether the overexpression of Ero1 actually accelerates the oxidative folding pathway. To address this point we studied the post-translational folding of tPA in cells following labeling in the presence of a concentration of DTT known to prevent disulfide bond formation. All previous studies using mild concentrations of DTT to inhibit co-translational disulfide bond formation in newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins have shown that the effects of DTT are reversible, and that the proteins undergo post-translational disulfide bond formation when DTT was removed from the culture medium of the cells (20Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 21Valetti C. Sitia R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Tatu U. Hammond C. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that oxidizing conditions within the ER necessary for disulfide bond formation could be rapidly restored when DTT was removed from the cells. To determine the time required to re-establish oxidizing conditions within the ER and to form the native complement of disulfide bonds in reduced tPA, CHO cells were pulsed in the presence of DTT and then chased with an excess of non-radiolabeled cysteine and methionine in the absence of DTT. Cycloheximide was added to the chase medium to inhibit protein synthesis. Cells were chased for up to 90 min, treated with NEM, lysed, and tPA immunoisolated using the goat anti-human tPA polyclonal antibody. Time courses for intracellular disulfide bond formation in the untransfected (UT) and Ero1-Lα transfected (Ero1) CHO-tPA cells were constructed by separating the immunoisolated proteins by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3). When untransfected CHO-tPA cells were labeled for 10 min in the presence of 5 mm DTT, non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B, UT) revealed a sharp band at 0 min into the chase, indicating that no disulfide bond formation had occurred. After 5 min of the chase the banding pattern became more diffuse and protein migrated with greater mobility indicating partial disulfide bond formation. By 10 min of the chase there was a further increase in mobility, which was also observed when the samples were reduced prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 3A, UT). This was due to differential alkylation of partially oxidized tPA. No further increase in mobility was observed after 45 min of chase indicating that in the untransfected CHO-tPA cells disulfide bond formation was complete between 30 and 45 min into the chase. In the Ero1-Lα-overexpressing cells, tPA migrated as a diffuse band of disulfide bonded protein within 5 min of the chase (Fig. 3B, Ero1) and there was no further increase in mobility after 20 min of chase, indicating that in these cells disulfide bond formation was complete between 10 and 20 min into the chase. Thus overexpression of Ero1-Lα accelerates the recovery from DTT treatment, allowing more rapid oxidative folding within mammalian cells. The acceleration of the oxidative pathway would suggest that the rate-limiting step in the pathway is the oxidation of PDI by Ero1 as any increase in Ero1 causes acceleration in the rate of oxidation of the substrate. An increase in the intensity of tPA immunoisolated during the chase period after labeling in the presence of DTT was observed at early ti"
https://openalex.org/W2055665417,"Cytoplasmic transport is mediated by a group of molecular motors that typically work in isolation, under conditions where they must move their cargos long distances without dissociating from their tracks. This processive behavior requires specific adaptations of motor enzymology to meet these unique physiologic demands. One of these involves the ability of the two heads of a processive motor to communicate their structural states to each other. In this study, we examine a processive motor from the myosin superfamily myosin V. We have measured the kinetics of nucleotide release, of phosphate release, and of the weak-to-strong transition, as this motor interacts with actin, and we have used these studies to develop a model of how myosin V functions as a transport motor. Surprisingly, both heads release phosphate rapidly upon the initial encounter with an actin filament, suggesting that there is little or no intramolecular strain associated with this step. However, ADP release can be affected by both forward and rearward strain, and under steady-state conditions it is essentially prevented in the lead head until the rear head detaches. Many of these features are remarkably like those underlying the processive movement of kinesin on microtubules, supporting our hypothesis that different molecular motors satisfy the requirement for processive movement in similar ways, regardless of their particular family of origin.

Many of these features are remarkably like those underlying the processive movement of kinesin on microtubules, supporting our hypothesis that different molecular motors satisfy the requirement for processive movement in similar ways, regardless of their particular family of origin. Cytoplasmic transport motors are found in both the myosin and kinesin families and typically work in isolation (1Mehta A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1981-1998PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goldstein L.S.B. Philp A.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 141-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This physiology places a unique requirement on them: they must remain attached to their respective tracks through multiple ATPase cycles. This need for processivity demands that, at any given time, at least one of the two motor-containing “heads” remains strongly attached to its track to prevent the entire motor from prematurely detaching. Such coordination requires appropriate kinetics as well as structural communication between the heads to optimize processive movement. Myosin V is the first of the myosin superfamily members shown to be processive (3Forkey J.N. Quinlan M.E. Shaw M.A. Corrie J.E. Goldman Y.E. Nature. 2003; 422: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 4Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R.

Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying its movement has been studied extensively over the past 4 years, and a general picture of how it works has emerged (6Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The motor needs to take 36-nm steps along an actin filament to avoid spiraling around the actin filament. Myosin V accomplishes this by possessing large lever arms made up of six “IQ motifs” and their associated light chains (7Purcell T.J. Morris C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14159-14164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Espindola F.S. Suter D.M. Partata L.B. Cao T. Wolenski J.S. Cheney R.E. King S.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 269-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it uses these long lever arms to walk hand over hand along an actin filament for many steps before dissociating. How then is this processive behavior maintained? The processive behavior of myosin V presumably reflects specific adaptations it has made in its enzymology, which in aggregate facilitates its function as a transport motor. One of these adaptations is the identity of the rate-limiting step of the actin-activated ATPase cycle. The rate-limiting step for most isoforms of myosin II is phosphate release, which insures that the motor spends the majority of its ATPase cycle either detached or weakly bound to actin (i.e. low duty ratio). However, for myosin V, the rate-limiting step is ADP release, which allows the myosin to remain strongly bound to actin for the majority of the cycle (i.e. high duty ratio). The result of this difference is that myosin V has a duty ratio of ∼0.9 at high actin concentrations, compared with duty ratios of 0.03-0.04 for smooth and skeletal muscle myosin II (9De La Cruz E.M.

This large duty ratio is a feature that has been thought to be essential for processive, transport motors, because it would reduce the probability of premature dissociation from actin. However, a large duty ratio by itself may not be enough to ensure that myosin V can function properly in its transport role, because we have shown that myosin IIB, a member of the myosin II family designed for tension generation, also has a high duty ratio (10Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Chen L.-Q. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27449-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to needing large duty ratios, the two heads of processive motors must also communicate their structural states to each other throughout their mechanochemical cycles. This communication is needed to ensure that the two heads do not weakly bind to their track simultaneously, an event that would lead to premature dissociation and that could have dire physiologic consequences. In the case of myosin V, how this allosteric communication is carried out and how it is coupled to the ATPase cycle remain unclear. Three models have recently emerged (5Veigel C. Wang F. Bartoo M.L. Sellers J.R. Molloy J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 4: 59-65Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11Rief M. Rock R.S. Mehta A.D. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In the first, the intramolecular strain that develops when both heads are bound to the actin filament mediates this allosteric communication. In this model, rearward strain on the forward head prevents this motor domain from binding ATP and detaching until the strain is relieved by detachment of the trailing head (11Rief M. Rock R.S. Mehta A.D. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9482-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In the second model, forward strain on the rearward head accelerates its detachment from actin (5Veigel C. Wang F. Bartoo M.L. Sellers J.R. Molloy J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 4: 59-65Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In both of these models, intramolecular strain plays a central role, much as in the case of microtubule motor kinesin (13Rosenfeld S.S. Fordyce P. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. Block S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18550-18556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), where we have shown that strain accelerates motor dissociation from the trailing head and blocks motor dissociation from the leading head. In the third model, intramolecular strain plays no role at all (12De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Rather, strong binding by the rearward head prevents actin binding and phosphate release by the forward head. Processivity in this model would be favored if ATP binding to the rearward head were to lead to rapid and strong binding of the forward head. Thus, it remains unclear whether strain plays a role at all in the processivity of myosin V, and if so, what effect it has on the kinetics of specific transitions in the mechanochemical cycle. Addressing these issues is the focus of this study. Our results show that both forward and rearward strain can affect the kinetics of crucial structural transitions in the myosin V ATPase cycle. However, under steady-state conditions, it is the effect of rearward strain in retarding ADP release from the forward head that provides the critical coordination for processivity. Our results also show that phosphate release is rapid for both heads and occurs before the heads bind strongly to actin. Taken together these data provide the first evidence that phosphate is released immediately upon myosin V binding to actin and that it occurs prior to formation of a strong binding state and development of intramolecular strain. Our results demonstrate that only the release of ADP is strain-sensitive, ensuring that both heads will be strongly bound to actin once the lead head finds an actin-binding site. Thus the degree of processivity of myosin V is ultimately limited by the rate at which a newly detached head can find an actin binding site. This arrangement ensures that both heads will be strongly bound to actin once the lead head finds an actin-binding site. Reagents—The N-methylanthraniloyl derivative of 2′deoxy-ADP was synthesized as described previously (24Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). N-1-Pyrenyl iodoacetamide was obtained from Molecular Probes (Portland, OR). Protease inhibitors and chemicals used for buffers were obtained from Sigma. Pre-poured Sephadex G-25 columns (PD10) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Proteins—Actin was prepared from rabbit acetone powder, and labeling at cysteine 374 with N-1-pyrenyl iodoacetamide was carried out as described before (14Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphate-binding protein was purified from Escherichia coli and labeled with MDCC 1The abbreviations used are: MDCC, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; 2′dmD, 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP; 2′dmT, 2′-deoxy-mant-ATP; PBP, phosphate-binding protein; S1, monomeric construct of myosin V; HMM; dimeric construct of myosin V. as described (25Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Recombinant Myosin V Expression and Purification—Chicken myosin V cDNA was expressed in two forms. The constructs were based on the previously described two-headed (HMM-like) myosin construct, myosin V-6IQ HMM (7Purcell T.J. Morris C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14159-14164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The construct was used to create either a two-headed (HMM-like) or single-headed (S1-like) construct. This myosin V-6IQ HMM heavy chain was truncated at Glu-1099, to which was added a leucine zipper (GCN4) to ensure dimerization, then followed by a FLAG tag (for purification). For the single-headed (S1-like) construct, the coiled-coil was removed and the heavy chain was truncated at amino acid Lys-910 to create myosin V-6IQ S1. As for the HMM, a FLAG tag was added after Lys-910 to facilitate purification. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated and used for co-expression in SF9 cells with calmodulin and essential light chains (7Purcell T.J. Morris C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14159-14164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Using the methodology detailed previously (26Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F Faust L Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), purified myosin V HMM or S1 protein was obtained. Fig. 1 illustrates an SDS-PAGE of a purified myosin V HMM 6IQ preparation and demonstrates that a typical yield has high purity and minimal evidence of proteolysis. Concentrations of recombinant myosin V preparations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The reference samples were recombinant myosin V HMM and S1 whose concentrations were determined by absorbance, using calculated extinction coefficients of 540,240 m-1 cm-1 for HMM and 129,610 m-1 cm-1 for S1. Complexes of myosin V constructs with 2′dmD were formed by pre-incubating S1 and HMM with a 20-fold molar excess of 2′dmD, followed by gel filtration on pre-poured Sephadex G-25 columns (PD10, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractional labeling of the complexes with 2′dmD was determined by using the extinction coefficient of the fluorescent nucleotide (5700 m-1 cm-1 at 356 nm (24Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar)) and the measured protein concentration. Ratios of 2′dmD to active site concentration were typically 0.90-0.95. Kinetic Methodologies—Kinetic measurements were made using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer with an instrument dead time of 1.2 ms (27Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36731-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths for monitoring pyrene-labeled actin and MDCC-labeled phosphate-binding protein fluorescence have been described (10Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Chen L.-Q. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27449-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For studies of 2′dmD and 2′dmD·Pi release, mant fluorescence was monitored by both direct excitation (λex = 356 nm) and by energy transfer from vicinal tryptophan residues (λex = 295 nm), and both methods gave similar results. Our experimental approach was to compare the kinetics of key steps of the myosin V HMM mechanochemical cycle during the first one to two turnovers to those for an S1 construct, because this would allow us to test the role of internal strain in shaping the kinetics of native myosin V. We also examined the kinetics of several of these steps under steady-state conditions to evaluate the physiologic relevance of our findings. Actin Binding in the Presence of ADP—Previous studies have noted that dimeric myosin V constructs can aggregate actin filaments under conditions that favor strong binding (28Walker M.L. Burgess S.A. Sellers J.R. Wang F. Hammer J.A. Trinick J. Knight P.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 29Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). This effect is presumed to be due to the presence of extended lever arms, which would allow cross-linking of actin filaments and could interfere with spectroscopic measurements. We have addressed this issue by comparing the kinetics of the light scattering increase produced by mixing myosin V S1·ADP with actin to those using HMM·ADP. Fig. 2A illustrates a typical light scattering transient, produced by mixing 0.8 μm S1 or HMM (active site concentration) with 6 μm actin in the presence of 1 mm ADP. For S1 (red), the transient consisted of a rapid phase (inset, red transient), sometimes accompanied by a low amplitude (<5% total) slow phase. By contrast, mixing with HMM (green) produced two well separated phases. The faster phase (inset, green transient) constituted ∼60% of the total signal amplitude. The slower phase fit a single exponential process (solid curve), showed little actin concentration dependence, and measured 0.03-0.05 s-1. We propose that the fast phase for both the HMM and S1 transients represents strong binding of at least one head to actin, whereas the slow phase seen with HMM is due to cross-linking. The HMM-induced cross-linking could be due to one of two possibilities. First, steric constraints on the lever arm could prevent the second head of HMM from binding strongly to the same actin filament. Because of its limited rotational freedom in the ADP state, the second head would only be able to slowly attach to neighboring actin filaments, producing a cross-linked aggregate. This possibility would predict that mixing HMM with pyrene-labeled actin in the presence of ADP should produce a fluorescence decrease that is the mirror image of the light scattering transient, e.g. two phases of similar amplitude, with the slower phase characterized by a rate constant of 0.03-0.05 s-1. The second possibility is that binding of both heads of HMM to the same actin filament is kinetically favored but leads to a system that is internally strained. In this case, strain could be relieved by release of the forward head (with rate constant of 0.03-0.05 s-1), followed by attachment to a neighboring actin filament. In this scenario, mixing of HMM with pyrene-labeled actin should produce a fast fluorescence decrease that is not followed by a slow phase. Furthermore, this possibility would predict that the amplitude of the fast fluorescence decrease should be the same as that for an equimolar S1 concentration. Fig. 2B illustrates the results of mixing 0.8 μm (active site concentration) S1·ADP (green) or HMM·ADP (red) with 6 μm pyrene-labeled actin (50% labeled). Strong binding to actin quenches the pyrenyl fluorescence, and for both S1 and HMM, this process (inset) is considerably more rapid than cross-linking (Fig. 2A). A detailed analysis of the kinetics of this rapid quenching demonstrates biphasic decays for both HMM and S1 (inset), with apparent second order rate constants of 16-19 μm-1 s-1 and 1-4 μm-1 s-1 (data not shown). More important, the total amplitudes of this pyrene fluorescence transient were nearly identical for equimolar active site concentrations of S1 and HMM preparations (Fig. 2B, inset). Finally, it should be noted that over the time scale where cross-linking occurs (>2 s after mixing with HMM), no further decrease in pyrene fluorescence was seen in the HMM transients. In fact, a small amplitude rising phase was noted, which fit a single exponential process at 0.05-0.07 s-1 (Fig. 2B, solid curve). As indicated by the discussion above, we interpret these results to mean that, after mixing, both heads of HMM bind relatively rapidly to the same actin filament. We predict that this would generate intramolecular strain, which would be relieved by a slow dissociation of the leading head from one actin filament and its subsequent rebinding to a neighboring filament. Labeling actin with pyrene reduces its affinity for myosin (14Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the combination of rearward strain on the leading head, which would favor its dissociation from actin, with the increased affinity of an ADP-containing head for unlabeled actin, would together lead to rebinding to unlabeled actin subunits on neighboring filaments. This should lead to an overall reduction in pyrene actin subunits with a strongly bound HMM head, because in this experiment, only 50% of the actin subunits were labeled, and this would be manifested by a low amplitude rise in fluorescence at ∼0.05 s-1. This prediction is confirmed in Fig. 2B. Actin-activated ADP Release—Because ADP release is rate-limiting in the cycle (9De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of strain on the kinetics of ADP release. This was monitored by mixing a complex of S1·2′dmD or HMM·2′dmD in the stopped flow with actin plus excess nucleotide. Fig. 3A illustrates the fluorescence transients produced by mixing a complex of 2 μm (active site concentration) S1·2′dmD (red) or HMM·2′dmD (green) with 20 μm actin plus 2 mm ADP. For S1, the transient could be fit to a single exponential decay, reflecting dissociation of the bound 2′dmD, and the rate constant of this process varied hyperbolically with actin concentration (Fig. 3A, inset, red circles), defining a maximum rate constant of 15.8 ± 1.6 s-1. This result is very similar to previously reported studies that used mant-ADP, which is a mixture of the 2′ and 3′ isomers (9De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). By contrast, the corresponding fluorescence transient for HMM was clearly biphasic, and the two phases had similar amplitudes (Fig. 3B). Only the faster phase showed a dependence of rate constant on actin concentration (Fig. 3A, inset, green boxes), with an extrapolated maximum of 29.5 ± 3.4 s-1: nearly twice as large as the corresponding value for S1. The slower phase (inset, green triangles) averaged ≈0.3-0.4 s-1 and showed little variation with actin concentration. These results are consistent with the model illustrated in Fig. 3C, where the fluorescence of the bound 2′dmD is symbolized by the magenta rays emanating from the actin-bound heads. We propose that forward strain on the rear head accelerates ADP release by a factor of approximately two, whereas rearward strain on the forward head markedly slows ADP release, to ≈0.3 s-1. Release of this strain would occur with a slow dissociation of the forward head (at 0.03-0.05 s-1). This would then be rapidly followed by rebinding to a neighboring actin filament, which would likely occur with an altered geometry, one that would be unlikely to generate strain. We tested this proposal by mixing HMM·2′dmD or S1·2′dmD in the stopped flow with actin plus 2 mm ATP. Because S1 cannot generate internal strain, we would predict that the results with S1 in this experiment should be similar to those for the experiment discussed above. Fig. 4A confirms this. The fluorescence transient for S1 (red) is well fit by a single exponential decay, and the rate constant of the transient shows nearly an identical hyperbolic dependence on actin concentration (inset, red triangles, maximum rate constant 15.2 ± 1.0 s-1). Because we are proposing that forward strain accelerates ADP release from the trailing head, we would also expect that the fluorescence transient for HMM should be biphasic and that the maximum rate for the faster phase should be similar to that in Fig. 3A. The transient for HMM in this experiment (Fig. 4A, green) fits a double exponential decay, and the rate constant of the faster phase shows a hyperbolic dependence on actin concentration, which is very similar to that measured in the presence of ADP (inset, green boxes, maximum rate constant 28.9 ± 5.3 s-1). By contrast, the rate constant of the second phase for the HMM transient in this experiment was considerably faster, with a maximum of 8.8 ± 1.8 s-1 (inset, green triangles). As in the case of Fig. 3, the relative amplitudes of the two phases for HMM were similar (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with the scheme depicted in Fig. 4C. Although excess ADP would keep HMM strongly bound and under strain, and while strain would inhibit 2′dmD release from the leading head, excess ATP would bind to the trailing head once it had released its 2′dmD. This would dissociate the trailing head, relieve the internal strain (symbolized by a serpentine regulatory domain) and allow 2′dmD to dissociate from the leading head. A maximum rate constant of 8.8 ± 1.8 s-1 (Fig. 4A, inset, green triangles) would be consistent with the model depicted in Fig. 4C if release of 2′dmD from the trailing head were immediately followed by ATP binding and dissociation from actin, allowing 2′dmD to release from the leading head at a rate defined by our studies with S1 (12-15 s-1; Ref. 9De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar and Fig. 4A). Kinetics of Phosphate and Product Release—We measured the kinetics of actin-activated phosphate release from myosin V S1 and HMM at equal active site concentrations in a sequential mixing experiment. Nucleotide-free S1 or HMM was mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of ATP, the complex was allowed to age for 1 s to allow population of the myosin V·ADP·Pi state, and it was then mixed with varying concentrations of actin plus 2 mm ADP. Phosphate release was monitored with MDCC-labeled phosphate-binding protein (MDCC-PBP), as previously described (10Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Chen L.-Q. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27449-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), with a MDCC-PBP·myosin concentration ratio of 7:1 after the second mix. Fig. 5 illustrates an example of the resulting fluorescence transients for HMM (red) and S1 (black) at final active site concentrations of 0.5 μm and at a final actin concentration of 5 μm. For both constructs, the fluorescence fit a single exponential process (solid curves in Fig. 5). The S1·HMM amplitude ratio averaged 1.28 ± 0.18 over a range of actin concentrations (Fig. 5, inset). Finally, the rates of phosphate release from both S1 (Fig. 6B, closed red circles) and HMM (Fig. 7B, closed red circles) showed a similar hyperbolic dependence on actin concentration, defining maximum rates of 198 ± 18 s-1 for S1 and 228 ± 32 s-1 for HMM.Fig. 6Kinetics of product release for S1.A, fluorescence transient produced by mixing 4 μm S1·2′dmD·Pi with 20 μm actin plus 2 mm ATP. The resulting fluorescence decrease (jagged red curve) fit a double exponential function (solid black line).

S1 was mixed sequentially with a 10-fold excess of 2′dmT and then with actin plus 2 mm ATP, and the rates of both phases (closed blue boxes and open blue boxes) are plotted versus actin concentration. The rate constant of the faster phase varied hyperbolically with actin concentration with maximum rate of 200 ± 75 s-1, whereas the slower phase showed little actin concentration dependence and ranged between 10 and 14 s-1. The rate constant of the fluorescence rise illustrated in the inset (solid green circles) varied little with actin concentration, and its mean value is 10.2 ± 1.6 s-1. The rate of phosphate release, measured with MDCC-labeled phosphate binding protein, versus actin concentration is also shown (solid red circles), and a hyperbolic fit defines a maximum rate constant of 198 ± 18 s-1. C, fluorescence transients produced by mixing 7.5 μm nucleotide-free myosin V S1 in the stopped flow with 5 μm 2′dmT (red transient) or 2′dmD (green transient). For 2′dmT, an initial rapid rise in fluorescence is followed by a slow decay with rate constant of 0.11 s-1 (solid blue curve), whereas for 2′dmD, only a rapid rising phase is seen. Note that the final voltage for the transient with 2′dmT is nearly identical to that for 2′dmD. D, fluorescence transients produced by mixing 7.5 μm nucleotide-free myosin V S1 in the stopped flow with 37.5 μm 2′dmT (red transient) or 2′dmD (green transient).

We labeled myosin VI with a single fluorophore on either its motor domain or on the distal of two calmodulins (CaMs) located on its putative lever arm. Using a technique called FIONA (fluorescence imaging with one nanometer accuracy), step size was observed with a standard deviation of <1.5 nm, with 0.5-s temporal resolution, and observation times of minutes. Irrespective of probe position, the average step size of a labeled head was ∼60 nm, strongly supporting a hand-over-hand model of motility and ruling out models in which the unique myosin VI insert comes apart. However, the CaM probe displayed large spatial fluctuations (presence of ATP but not ADP or no nucleotide) around the mean position, whereas the motor domain probe did not. This supports a model of myosin VI motility in which the lever arm is either mechanically uncoupled from the motor domain or is undergoing reversible isomerization for part of its motile cycle on actin.

The myosin superfamily is composed of 18 classes of molecular motor proteins, the vast majority of which traffic toward the barbed (+) end of actin filaments (1Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol.

Myosin VI has been shown recently to have only two CaMs bound to each head (14Bahloul A. Chevreux G. Wells A.L. Martin D. Nolt J. Yang Z. Chen L.-Q. Potier N. Dorsselaer A.V. Rosenfeld S.S. Houdusse A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which should result in a short effective lever arm and small step size. Surprisingly, myosin VI has a step size that is highly variable (7Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) but on average nearly as large as that of myosin V, which has a lever arm that is three times longer. The variability of the step size has led to the postulate that myosin VI contains a long elastic element that allows it to undergo biased diffusion on an actin filament. The elastic element could be attached to the short lever arm, and/or the lever arm itself could become loosely attached to the motor at some point in the motile ATPase cycle. It was initially postulated that the unique insert of 39 amino acids in myosin VI that precedes the IQ motif (CaM-binding site) might come apart to form this flexible linker during the motile cycle on actin (7Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This would result in the CaM being significantly displaced from the motor domain. EM images of two-headed myosin V bound to actin show the two heads attached to actin monomers that are 36 nm apart, equivalent to the measured step size (15Walker M.L. Burgess S.A. Sellers J.R. Wang F. Hammer III, J.A. Trinick J. Knight P.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, the only published EM images of two-headed myosin VI bound to actin appear to show the two heads bound to adjacent actin monomers (13Nishikawa S. Homma K. Komori Y. Iwaki M. Wazawa T. Hikikoshi Iwane A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Katayama E. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that myosin VI might use an inchworm mechanism, or some related mechanism (13Nishikawa S. Homma K. Komori Y. Iwaki M. Wazawa T. Hikikoshi Iwane A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Katayama E. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), in which one head is always the lead head. Thus the stepping mechanism of myosin VI is totally unclear. Another surprising recent finding is that expressed full-length myosin VI molecules do not dimerize (16Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that dimerization is a regulated process for this motor in vivo, perhaps analogous to the kinesin family member, Unc104 (17Al-Bassam J. Cui Y. Klopfenstein D. Carragher B.O. Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Single-headed, full-length myosin VI molecules were shown to have a non-processive movement (stroke) of ∼18 nm (16Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The authors of the study suggested that this could be due to a conventional lever arm of ∼10 nm going through a 180° rotation. However, it is unclear how the properties of the monomeric motor are related to the behavior of the dimer. To attempt to clarify the nature of the myosin VI stepping mechanism, we have applied the same technique that was developed and used to demonstrate a hand-over-hand mechanism for myosin V motility (8Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R. Science. 2003; 300: 2061-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). This technique has been termed fluorescence imaging with one nanometer accuracy (FIONA) and can track the position of a single fluorophore with ∼1.5 nm resolution. By placing a fluorophore on either the motor domain or the IQ-bound calmodulin of one head of a two-headed myosin VI construct, we were able to address whether myosin VI uses a hand-over-hand mechanism. We also assessed whether or not there is a dissociation of structural elements proximal to the IQ-CaM from the motor domain during any part of the actin-bound ATPase cycle. Protein Constructs and Expression—For the construction of the double-headed enhanced GFP (eGFP)-myosin VI construct, the eGFP cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was fused to the N terminus of the porcine myosin VI cDNA, which was truncated at Arg-994. This was followed by a leucine zipper (GCN4) to ensure dimerization and then a FLAG tag (encoding GDYKDDDDK) was included at the C terminus to facilitate purification (18Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Biotechnology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The construct was used to create a baculovirus for expression in Sf9 cells, as described previously (7Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 19De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To produce myosin VI dimers with only one eGFP-containing head, the virus coding for the eGFP heavy chain was co-infected with an unlabeled heavy chain at a ratio of 1:10. Assuming equal expression levels from the two viruses, this should result in a population that contains primarily unlabeled dimers, a small population of single eGFP-containing dimers, and virtually no double-labeled dimers. For the Cy3-CaM-labeled constructs, chicken CaM with a single cysteine (Thr-146 → Cys) was expressed in E. coli. This expressed mutant CaM was labeled with Cy3. Unlabeled two-headed myosin VI was incubated with a mixture of unlabeled CaM and Cy3-CaM (ratio of 2:1). Exchange of the IQ-CaM was initiated by increasing the free [Ca2+] to 100 μm. The concentration was then reduced to submicromolar, and unbound CaM was removed by gel filtration. The resulting myosin VI molecules had a single labeled CaM on one out of seven molecules. Optics—All optics and data acquisition statistics used were previously described by Yildiz et al. (8Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R. Science. 2003; 300: 2061-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). The only exception to this was the use of a 100 × 1.65 N.A. objective and associated sapphire coverslip (Olympus) used for the eGFP-myosin VI experiments. In addition, to ensure that polarization did not affect the results, the fluorophore emission was sent through a polarizing beam splitter (Dual View, Optical Insights Inc.), separating the orthogonal polarizations. The GFP-myosin VI and Cy3-myosin VI step sizes of each polarization were measured and found to be virtually identical to each other. Myosin-VI has a single “IQ motif” (calmodulin-binding site) following the motor domain and contains a coiled-coil region as well as a globular C-terminal tail (2Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.-Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 5Avraham K.B. Hasson T. Steel K.P. Kingsley D.M. Russell L.B. Mooseker M.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Myosin VI also contains a unique insertion in between the motor domain and IQ motif, which recently was shown to be an unexpected binding site for a second calmodulin (14Bahloul A. Chevreux G. Wells A.L. Martin D. Nolt J. Yang Z. Chen L.-Q. Potier N. Dorsselaer A.V. Rosenfeld S.S. Houdusse A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As mentioned in the introduction, in vitro expression of full-length myosin VI does not result in a dimer, raising the possibility that the dimerization may be a regulated process in vivo (16Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). When we initially constructed the dimer used in this study (2Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.-Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), we noted several peculiarities about the myosin VI coiled coil. First, based on Paircoil predictions, was the fact that the first 42 amino acids following the IQ motif (Leu-829 to Gln-871) had <50% of actually being coiled coil. This was followed by a 17 heptads of high probability coiled coil (Val-872 to Arg-994). However, nowhere in the coiled coil could we find a consensus trigger sequence (20Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which would be necessary to initiate dimerization. Indeed, when a truncated myosin VI that ends at Arg-994 was expressed, dimers did not form (data not shown). Thus it is likely that dimerization is initiated by sequences distal to this coiled coil or perhaps even by other myosin VI-binding proteins. Our previous experience with the smooth muscle rod (21Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) had demonstrated that the first 25 heptads of that coiled coil would not dimerize unless a trigger sequence was appended. In that study, as in this study, we appended GCN4, which contains a consensus trigger sequence (20Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and will initiate dimerization of coiled coils lacking a trigger sequence. However, the myosin VI coiled coil is necessary for dimer stability, since when we remove all of the putative coiled coil from myosin VI and append only GCN4, dimers are not observed at the low concentrations (picomolar) of motor necessary for single molecule studies. This results in only single-headed encounters with actin in such assays (data not shown). To ensure that GCN4 did not alter the phasing of the coiled coil in a way that would influence the behavior of the motor domains of myosin VI, the GCN4 was inserted after the 12th heptad of coiled coil (ending at Arg-994). There are two predicted skips in the coiled coil between this heptad and the highest probability (∼1) coiled coil (Gln-920 to Glu-954), which would prevent GCN4 from altering the phasing of the upstream coiled coil. To place a fluorophore on the motor domain we created an eGFP-myosin VI fusion protein, with the eGFP at the N terminus of the motor. To selectively label only one of the two IQ-bound CaMs per double-headed molecule, we incubated labeled (Cy3) and unlabeled CaM (excess unlabeled) with myosin VI and then raised and lowered the free calcium concentration. Based on our previous work (14Bahloul A. Chevreux G. Wells A.L. Martin D. Nolt J. Yang Z. Chen L.-Q. Potier N. Dorsselaer A.V. Rosenfeld S.S. Houdusse A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we had observed that the first CaM is strongly bound to the unique insert with four Ca2+ at any Ca2+ concentration and is thus unaffected by changing Ca2+ concentration. (This was confirmed by the inability to exchange any labeled CaM onto an expressed myosin VI construct that lacked the IQ motif (data not shown).) On the other hand, four Ca2+ can bind and dissociate from the IQ-bound CaM. For this to occur, the IQ-CaM must transiently dissociate from its binding site and is thus free to exchange. What we observed for both the eGFP and Cy3-CaM molecules clearly supports a hand-over-hand mechanism of movement. As shown in the raw traces and histograms of Fig. 1, A and B, the average step of the single labeled head was ∼60 nm (see Fig. 1). While there was a skewing of the eGFP distribution to somewhat larger steps (63.3 ± 16.7 nm versus 55.2 ± 19.6 nm), this likely was an artifact due to the “blinking” of eGFP that caused many of the smaller steps to be unscored. (Note that the duration of the eGFP steps was shorter than for Cy3-CaM steps because the ATP concentration was higher. This was necessary to collect a sufficient number of steps before the eGFP photo-bleached.) For a hand-over-hand mechanism, this would imply that each of the two heads of the two-headed molecule is alternately taking ∼30-nm steps. This agrees with the published optical trap data (7Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). An inchworm model would predict that the individual heads would take 30-nm steps, rather than the 60-nm steps that we observe. Also in agreement with the published myosin VI data is that the step size distribution is much broader than was seen for myosin V (8Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R. Science. 2003; 300: 2061-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar) (±19.6 nm for CaM-labeled myosin VI versus ± 5.3 nm for CaM-labeled myosin V), and back steps were observed. In addition, to confirm the hand-over-hand model, we plotted the dwell time histogram (8Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R. Science. 2003; 300: 2061-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar) of myosin VI. As expected, it shows the convolution of a ∼60-nm step, intermingled with a 0-nm step (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Dwell times of steps of single fluorophore-labeled myosin VI.A, dwell time histogram of 36 myosin VIs taking 276 steps. Initial rise at short dwell period is indicative of myosin VI head takes 60-nm to 0-nm steps and the data fit well to the convolution function based on the kinetic hand-over-hand model, P(t) = tk2e–kt (blue line) yielding coefficient of determination (R) = 0.95. Myosin VI takes 0.69 steps per second per molecule at 40 μm ATP. B, dwell time histogram of 52 myosin VIs taking 251 steps. The fit gives a rate constant k = 1.40 s–1 (r = 0.93) at 80 μm ATP, which is double of the rate constant of Cy3-CaM-labeled myosin VI at 40 μm ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) What was not observed (see traces in Fig. 1) was a large asymmetry in alternate steps. This would be expected if the unique insert that precedes the CaM comes apart to form a long, flexible tether during some part of the motile cycle on actin, as was proposed previously (7Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The appearance of substeps within each large step (i.e. alternating 50- and 10-nm steps), correlated with the swing of the short myosin VI lever arm was also not observed (Fig. 1). Given the position of the Cy3-labeled CaM, the spatial resolution should be adequate to see a lever arm swing of greater than a few nanometers. It is possible that the linkage between the heads is compliant enough to allow most of the swing of the lead head to occur rapidly upon attachment to actin, and thus the movement is beyond the temporal resolution of our instrumentation (0.33–0.5 s). However, the compliance cannot be so great as to allow the entire swing, as this would prevent the kinetic “gating” than has been observed (19De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (binding of ATP to the lead head is prevented until the rear head has detached). A second possible explanation for lack of substeps is suggested by close examination of the data. Although the average step size did not differ between the molecules with eGFP on the motor and Cy3 on the IQ-CaM, there was an important difference in the two sets of data. While the position of the eGFP-myosin VI motor showed very little spatial fluctuation, the Cy3-CaM oscillated around its mean position by ∼7 nm. (Note that in the previous publication with labeled CaM on myosin V, such large spatial fluctuations were not seen, although asymmetric steps were seen (8Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R. Science. 2003; 300: 2061-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar).) This point was further explored by attaching the myosin VI-Cy3-CaM to actin either in the presence of MgADP (100 μm) or no nucleotide. In either case, the spatial fluctuations seen in the presence of MgATP were not present. In ADP or rigor, the standard deviation (σ) goes from 5 nm for an intensity of 200 photons to 3 nm for 600 photons. These numbers are in good agreement with the results that we reported for immobilized Cy3-DNA molecules on glass (8Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R. Science. 2003; 300: 2061-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). However in ATP, σ is significantly larger (∼7 nm) and stays relatively constant over the same intensity range, implying that in the ATP case, collecting more photons does not increase the resolution because the dye is highly mobile. If the ATP concentration was lowered to 0.1 μm, the fluctuations were essentially the same as in the absence of nucleotide. This implies that the IQ-CaM of myosin VI is either uncoupled from the motor domain or is undergoing a reversible isomerization involving lever arm movement, during the myosin VI motile cycle on actin prior to ADP release. This likely involves a strongly actin-bound ADP state (or states) that is populated when going through the cycle but not populated by simple addition of ADP. The rearward strain (gating) provided by an attached rear head would greatly slow a lead head in such a state(s) from undergoing the structural transition necessary for product release. If the fluctuations are not due to a reversible isomerization, but to a physical uncoupling, then that uncoupling could occur either between the two CaMs, between the unique insert and the converter domain of the motor or perhaps between the converter domain and the rest of the motor. (Such an uncoupling of the converter has been seen in a crystal structure of scallop myosin II with MgADP bound (22Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).) One can construct a model of the myosin VI stepping mechanism (Fig. 3) that incorporates these new findings and is consistent with the known kinetic scheme (19De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) of myosin VI. To have a net movement contributed by the lever arm of myosin VI, such a model must begin with a detached myosin VI head with ADP·Pi bound to the head and the lever arm pointing toward the barbed (+) end of the actin filament. When that head binds to actin, it rapidly releases the Pi and attaches with high affinity to actin. At this point the attached rear head prevents the lead head from reaching a sate that can rapidly release ADP, and the lever arm position of the lead head begins fluctuating. (Note, if the lead head was rapidly attaching and detaching in a weak actin-binding, ADP·Pi state, the motor position of a lead head would likely be seen on different actin monomers, rather than remaining bound to a single actin-binding site.) The lead head of an attached dimer is prevented from releasing ADP and/or binding ATP until the rear head detaches from actin (following ATP binding). This implies that the strain placed on a lead head by an attached rear head favors ADP remaining bound and disfavors ATP binding, which has been demonstrated in the optical trap (23Altman D. Sweeney H.L. Spudich J.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 737-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Once the rear head detaches, the mobility of the lever arm of the attached head would facilitate a diffusive search for an actin-binding site by the newly detached head. However, the fluctuations would allow the search to explore a larger number of potential actin sites than with a semi-rigid lever arm. The former lead head, now an unstrained rear head, can either strongly couple its lever arm to the motor, or reach an ADP state that allows release of ADP. Thus the rigor myosin VI rear head would have an immobilized lever arm, which is consistent with the cryo-EM reconstructions of single-headed myosin VI molecules (2Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.-Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The model described above partly can account for the variability in the myosin VI stepping, since the lever arm is undergoing fluctuations. However, it cannot fully account for the large size of the myosin VI steps. There must be structural elements that follow the IQ-CaM that extend the reach of the unbound head. Although this region has been assumed to be a part of a coiled coil, the first 42 amino acids following the IQ motif in fact have a very low probability of being coiled coil (Paircoil). This region could have some structure that effectively creates a longer lever arm, with most of the apparent flexibility of the myosin VI lever arm resulting from the uncoupling of the lever arm from the motor. Alternatively, this region could itself be a flexible tether to extend the distance of the diffusive search of an unbound head. Undoubtedly, there are more surprises to come with perhaps the most unconventional of the unconventional myosins, myosin VI.

We have previously demonstrated that hypoxia decreases expression of neuronal marker genes in neuroblastoma, but induces genes expressed in the neural crest, such as ID2. Because of its involvement in normal neural crest development and its ability to inhibit proneuronal bHLH proteins, the hypoxic induction of ID2 was of particular interest. Here we report fast induction kinetics of ID2 expression in hypoxic neuroblastoma cells. The up-regulation of ID2 was abolished by addition of actinomycin D, implicating a hypoxia-driven transcriptional mechanism. Analyzing the ID2 promoter revealed several potential binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factors. Subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated two functional HIF-1 binding sites within ID2 gene regulatory sequences located at –725 and –1893 relative to the transcriptional initiation point. In transfection assays, DNA constructs of the ID2 promoter, including the functional HIF-1 binding sites, induced luciferase reporter activity in a HIF-1-specific manner. These observations demonstrate that ID2 is actively engaged by hypoxia and represents a novel HIF-1 target. Hypoxia-induced ID2 expression could play a significant role in the previously observed dedifferentiation of hypoxic neuroblastoma cells, which in a clinical setting could lead to less mature and more aggressive tumors.

In addition to regulation of stability, hydroxylation of an asparagine residue within the α-subunit negatively interferes with the function of the transactivation region of HIF under normoxic conditions (8Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Hypoxia abrogates both proline and asparagine hydroxylation (4Bruick R.K.

Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6089) Google Scholar), but there is, paradoxically, an inverse correlation between the degree of tumor oxygenation and patient survival (12Hockel M. Schlenger K. Aral B. Mitze M. Schaffer U. Vaupel P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4509-4515PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, hypoxic tumors appear to be more prone to invading surrounding tissue and to metastasize than better oxygenated ones (12Hockel M. Schlenger K. Aral B. Mitze M. Schaffer U. Vaupel P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4509-4515PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brizel D.M. Scully S.P. Harrelson J.M. Layfield L.J. Bean J.M. Prosnitz L.R. Dewhirst M.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 941-943PubMed Google Scholar). Because HIF-1α overexpression has also been found in most cancers it seems that increased adaptation to hypoxia enhances aggressive tumor behavior and progression to a lethal phenotype (3Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common extracranial solid pediatric tumor, arises where sympathetic nervous system (SNS) tissue forms (14Hoehner J.C. Gestblom C. Hedborg F. Sandstedt B. Olsen L.

Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2000: 9-19Google Scholar). Depending on the differentiation stage of the tumor cells at diagnosis, the clinical behavior can be predicted, with immature tumors being more aggressive and having a poor prognosis (16Hedborg F.

Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma derives from immature sympathetic neural precursors, often with remaining neural crest traits (14Hoehner J.C.

We have previously found that hypoxic neuroblastoma tumors and cells exposed to hypoxia (1% O2) down-regulate SNS marker genes, including the neuronal transcription factors HASH-1 and dHAND (19Jögi A. Øra I. Nilsson H. Lindeheim A. Makino Y. Poellinger L. Axelson H. Påhlman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), as well as the gene coding for the E-protein E2-2 (20Jögi A. Vallon-Christersson J. Holmquist L. Axelson H. Borg Å. Påhlman S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, hypoxia induces expression of genes involved in early neural crest development, in particular NOTCH-1 and ID2, overall suggesting a dedifferentiation of neuroblastoma cells toward an immature neural crest-like phenotype (19Jögi A. Øra I. Nilsson H. Lindeheim A. Makino Y. Poellinger L. Axelson H. Påhlman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Moreover, hypoxic regions of mammary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and hypoxia-treated breast cancer cells have been shown to adopt a dedifferentiated phenotype, further implicating a roll of hypoxia on tumor maturation grade (21Helczynska K. Kronblad Å. Jögi A. Nilsson E. Beckman S. Landberg G. Påhlman S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1441-1444PubMed Google Scholar). The ID (inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding) proteins (ID1-ID4) are part of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family. They are direct or indirect negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors involved in cell lineage specification and in numerous developmental processes (22Yokota Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8290-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, development of chicken neural crest from ectodermal precursors requires a proper regulation of ID2 expression (23Martinsen B.J. Bronner-Fraser M. Science. 1998; 281: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), an observation clearly relevant in the context of neuroblastoma, which originates from neural crest-derived precursors. Besides inhibiting/regulating differentiation, the ID proteins have been shown to bind important cell cycle regulatory proteins other than bHLH proteins, thereby promoting proliferation and also influencing cellular immortalization (24Zebedee Z. Hara E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8317-8325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, a large variety of human tumors display dysregulated expression of ID proteins (25Lyden D. Young A.Z. Zagzag D. Yan W.

In addition, an essential role of ID proteins in physiological and tumor angiogenesis as well as in tumor invasion has been demonstrated (25Lyden D. Young A.Z. Zagzag D. Yan W. Gerald W. O'Reilly R.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the present study neuroblastoma cells demonstrated rapid induction of ID2 when cultured at hypoxia (1% O2). Hypoxia-induced up-regulation of ID2 was also seen in HeLa and human breast cancer MCF-7 and T47 cells, suggesting a general hypoxia-driven mechanism. These observations, together with a role of ID2 in the specification of neuronal lineages derived from the neural crest, indicated a possible involvement of ID2 in hypoxic neuroblastoma exhibiting neural crest-like features. Furthermore, the hypoxia-induced ID2 expression was abrogated by actinomycin D treatment, indicating a requirement for HIF-directed RNA synthesis. When examining the 5′-flanking regulatory region of the ID2 gene we found two sites that specifically bound HIF-1α/ARNT heterodimers both in vitro and in vivo. These two functional HIF binding sites induced luciferase reporter expression in HeLa cells when cotransfected with HIF-1α expression plasmids. Mutating the two HBSs decimated the HIF-1-specific up-regulation. Overall, these results demonstrate that the ID2 gene is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to hypoxia via the HIF pathway. The activation of ID2 could, in concert with down-regulation of transcription factors involved in neuronal lineage specification, such as dHAND, HASH-1, and E2-2 (19Jögi A. Øra I. Nilsson H. Lindeheim A. Makino Y. Poellinger L. Axelson H. Påhlman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 20Jögi A. Vallon-Christersson J.

Cell Res. 2004; 295: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), have a significant role in the dedifferentiation and progression of hypoxic neuroblastoma cells. Cell Culture—The following cell lines, maintained in conventional cell culture media, were used in this study: SK-N-BE(2), SH-SY5Y, and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells, HeLa cells, MCF-7, and T47 breast cancer cells, rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, and mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Under normoxic conditions, cells were incubated at 37 °C at an atmospheric pressure of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Hypoxic conditions were created by flushing 5% CO2 and 95% N2 through a humidified chamber at 37 °C until an environment containing 1% O2 was achieved, and measured with a MiniOX1 oxygen meter (Mine Safety Appliances Company). Induction of HIF-1α was also obtained by culturing cells at normoxic conditions with addition of 200 μm 2,2′-dipyridyl (DIP, Sigma). In some experiments, to determine the transcriptional regulation of investigated genes, actinomycin D (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 5 μg/ml medium. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 15 μg of total RNA per lane was analyzed as previously described (19Jögi A. Øra I. Nilsson H. Lindeheim A. Makino Y. Poellinger L. Axelson H. Påhlman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) with full-length human cDNA probes directed against ID1, ID2, and ID3 mRNA. Real-Time Quantitative PCR—The relative gene expression levels of ID1, ID2, ID3, and VEGF were determined by use of real-time quantitative PCR based on two-step SYBR green I chemistry (31Vandesompele J. De Paepe A. Speleman F. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 32De Preter K. Speleman F. Combaret V. Lunec J. Laureys G. Eussen B.H. Francotte N. Board J. Pearson A.D. De Paepe A. Van Roy N. Vandesompele J. Mod. Pathol. 2002; 15: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) was used for design of primer pairs (Table I). 2 μg of total RNA, respectively extracted from SK-N-BE(2), SH-SY5Y, and IMR-32 cells treated at hypoxia or normoxia, with or without 5 μg/ml medium of actinomycin D for 0, 2, 4, and 8 h and purified with RNeasy kit (Qiagen), were used for cDNA synthesis with random hexamers and Superscript II RT-enzyme (Invitrogen). Obtained cDNA was diluted to 500 μl in water and 5 μl was used as template in each 25-μl quantitative PCR. The amplification reactions were performed in a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence detector (Applied Biosystems), using a two-temperature cycling (10 min 95 °C and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s). For detection of the PCR products in real time the SYBR green I master mix (Eurogentec) was used. Four reference genes (SDHA, YWHAZ, HMBS, and UBC), previously employed as expression references for neuroblastoma cell lines (31Vandesompele J. De Paepe A. Speleman F. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and which were not regulated by growth under hypoxic conditions (data not shown) were used for normalization of the expression data. Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and the comparative Ct method was used for relative quantification of gene expression (32De Preter K. Speleman F. Combaret V. Lunec J. Laureys G.

This DNA sequence was then pasted into DNA Strider 1.0 software, which was employed to locate putative HBSs. The search was based on compilations of functional HBSs and the HIF-1 binding consensus sequence BDCGTV (B is C/T/G, D is A/G/T, V is G/C/A), in turn established by previous definitions of consensus sequences (33Camenisch G.

Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 160 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented before use with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). 80 μg of protein was separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and subsequently blotted onto Hybond C membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used: HIF-1α (mouse monoclonal, Novus Biologicals) and ARNT (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals). Super Signal substrate (Pierce) was used for chemiluminescence-based detection of appropriate secondary antibodies. Nuclear Extract Preparation—A modified protocol from Fink et al. (34Fink T.

Working on ice, cells were scraped into PBS and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 4 packed cell volumes of cold hypotonic buffer (HB) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and subsequently incubated 10 min on ice. Cells were then pelleted at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 4 packed cell volumes of lysis buffer (HB + 0.4% Nonidet P-40). This material was incubated for 10 min, whereafter the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then incubated in 2 packed cell volumes of high-salt buffer (HSB), containing 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.42 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m EDTA, 25% glycerol, for 20 min on ice with gentle agitation. Before use, both HB and HSB were supplemented with 20 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml pepstatin (Roche Applied Science), and HB was additionally complemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The nuclear debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Obtained supernatant was aliquoted, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Table II summarizes sense oligonucleotide probes encompassing putative HIF-1 binding sites and corresponding mutant probes used in EMSAs. Synthesized probes (from Invitrogen) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Appligene), annealed, and purified on G25 Microspin columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). DNA/protein binding reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.3, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 20–30 min at 4 °C. Salmon sperm DNA at 1–20 ng/μl was added as bulk carrier DNA before binding reactions. Proteins were added in form of either 5 μg of nuclear extract or in vitro synthesized HIF-1α and ARNT. The synthetic HIF-1 complex proteins were generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation from pSP72/hHIF-1α and pGEM7/ARNT plasmids using rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Promega). Before addition of buffer, equal aliquots (3 μl/binding reaction) of HIF-1α and ARNT proteins were allowed to associate for 30 min at room temperature. Annealed [γ-32P]dATP-labeled probes were used in all reactions at a specific activity of 25,000 cpm. For competition experiments a 10–500-fold molar excess of unlabeled annealed probes was added to the binding reaction mixtures prior to addition of labeled probes. For supershift analysis 1 μl of antibody directed against HIF-1α (mouse monoclonal), ARNT (rabbit polyclonal), or MYCN (mouse-purified, BD PharMingen) was added to completed reaction mixtures and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C prior to electrophoresis. Samples were run on 4% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C for 3–4 h. Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V, 12 mA in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were then dried and autoradiographed.Table IIID2-derived oligonucleotide probes used for electrophoretic mobility shift assaysNameSequence (5′-3′)Location-93-HBSgataGACGTGccaccttc-97/-80-105-HBScccgCTCGTCttgataga-109/-92-301-HBSatccCTCGTCccgcatcc-305/-288-725-HBScgaaTGCGTGcgtgggtggtt-729/-713-734-HBSgcctGTCGTCgaatgcgt-738/-725-1588-HBSctgtCACGTGacggtcag-1592/-1575-1611-HBSgagaGGCGTCatggggcg-1615/-1598-1893-HBSgtggCACGTAtgtgacag-1897/-1880mt-725-HBScgaaTGAATGcgtgggtggtt-729/-713mt-1893-HBSgtggCAATTAtgtgacag-1897/-1880wt-EPO-HBSgcccTACGTGctgtctca+3065/+3082 (From Ref. 9Wang G.L.

Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then scraped into cold 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), 10 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and subsequently pelleted at 4000 rpm for 5 min. Pellets were sequentially washed with cold PBS, Buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES pH 6.5), and Buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES pH 6.5). Pellets were then resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0) containing 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture and thereafter sonicated until DNA was ∼500–700 bp in size. The samples were diluted 1:10 in 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and then incubated by rotation with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 6 μg of anti-human IgG antibodies (rabbit polyclonal, abcam) and 45 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 s and incubated at 4 °C overnight by rotation with antibodies against HIF-1α (mouse monoclonal), or human IgG (rabbit polyclonal) as a negative control. 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 45 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry were then added and incubated by rotation for another 2 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were collected at 3000 rpm for 15 s and sequentially washed for 15 min each under rotation with TSE I (0.1% SDS, Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl) and Buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) at room temperature. Beads were washed three times with TE buffer followed by elution in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 (3000 rpm, 15 s). Supernatants were incubated overnight at 65 °C, and DNA was purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The DNA was then used for 35 cycles of PCR together with primers flanking the putative HBSs within the ID2 promoter: –1893-HBS f-GCTGCAATGTCCAAGAATCA, r-GAGTCCTCCCACAGTTCGAG; –725-HBS f-GTTGCAAAAGCCCACACTAAGC, r-GTTCACTGCAACCCATCGG. Primers flanking the HBS of the VEGF promoter were used as a positive control: f-GCCTCTGTCTGCCCAGCTGC, r-GTGGAGCTGAGAACGGGAAGC. DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmids containing genomic DNA fragments of the human ID2 gene 5′-flanking region, respectively spanning from +35 to –1329 or –2755 relative transcriptional initiation, and inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in pGL3-Basic vector, were kindly provided by Dr. T. Tokino, Department of Molecular Biology, Cancer Research Institute, Sapporo, Japan. Mutations were introduced into the pID2-plasmids using the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system QuikChange II XL (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs and mutants were verified by sequencing employing the Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Triplicates of 5 × 104 HeLa cells in 24-well culture plates (Costar) were separately transfected overnight with 0.2 μg each of the ID2 promoter pGL3-Basic derivatives or empty pGL3-Basic vector, or a positive control vector containing three hypoxia-response elements in tandem, designated pHRE. For cotransfections, 0.4 μg of a pFLAG-mHIF-1α-(P402A,P563A) vector, expressing constitutively active HIF-1α (generous gift from Dr. Teresa Pereira, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden) or 0.4 μg of empty pFLAG vector only was introduced. All transient transfections also included 0.1 μg of a Renilla luciferase control reporter plasmid, pRL-TK (Promega), and were performed using Lipofectin Reagent and Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection followed by measurement of luciferase activity using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The luciferase activity was defined as the ratio of Photinus pyralis luciferase activity from pGL3-Basic derivatives or pHRE relative to Renilla reniformis luciferase activity from pRL-TK, which reflected the efficiency of transfection. Induction of ID2 and ID1 Expression by Hypoxia—As observed earlier (19Jögi A. Øra I. Nilsson H. Lindeheim A. Makino Y. Poellinger L. Axelson H. Påhlman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), expression of ID2 was increased in neuroblastoma cells after 4 h of hypoxia (1% O2) when compared with normoxic controls, as assessed by Northern blot analysis using total cellular RNA (Fig. 1, second panel). ID2 induction could also be detected in breast cancer cells as well as in HeLa cells, but not in investigated rodent cells. ID1 was also shown to be oxygen-regulated, with increased mRNA levels found in the tested neuroblastoma cells and in T47 breast cancer cells after 4 h under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1, top panel). No hypoxia-dependent induction of ID1 expression was however detected in MCF-7 breast cancer cells or HeLa cells.

Two rounds of random mutagenesis were performed on the best glycosynthase to date (AbgE358G), and transformants were screened using an on-plate endocellulase coupled assay. Two highly active mutants were obtained, 1D12 (A19T, E358G) and 2F6 (A19T, E358G, Q248R, M407V) in the first and second rounds, respectively. Relative catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of 1:7:27 were determined for AbgE358G, 1D12, and 2F6, respectively, using α-d-galactopyranosyl fluoride and 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside as substrates. The 2F6 mutant is not only more efficient but also has an expanded repertoire of acceptable substrates. Analysis of a homology model structure of 2F6 indicated that the A19T and M407V mutations do not interact directly with substrates but exert their effects by changing the conformation of the active site. Much of the improvement associated with the A19T mutation seems to be caused by favorable interactions with the equatorial C2-hydroxyl group of the substrate. The alteration of torsional angles of Glu-411, Trp-412, and Trp-404, which are components of the aglycone (+1) subsite, is an expected consequence of the A19T and M407V mutations based on the homology model structure of 2F6.

Oligosaccharides have considerable potential as therapeutics because of the numerous medicinally relevant physiological events that involve glycoconjugates (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar, 2Jacob G.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 3Dwek R.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 683-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). To expand our understanding of the various roles of oligosaccharides found in important cellular events, more efficient and selective synthetic protocols must be developed for the preparation of oligosaccharides. Classical chemical synthesis is often impractical for the synthesis of complex oligosaccharides because of the need for selective and labor-intensive protection-deprotection steps and difficulties in directing product stereochemistry. To overcome these limitations, enzymatic syntheses using glycosidases or glycosyl transferases have rapidly gained prominence (4Crout D.H. Vic G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Koeller K.M. Wong C.H. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 4465-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 6Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Polymers. 2001; 44: 325-337Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In recent years, the glycosynthase approach developed in this laboratory has added a new dimension to the enzymatic preparation of oligosaccharides (7Williams S.J. Withers S.G. Aust. J. Chem. 2002; 55: 3-12Crossref Google Scholar, 8Jakeman D.L. Withers S.G. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2002; 14: 13-25Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Perugino G. Trincone A. Rossi M. Moracci M. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 31-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Glycosynthases are retaining glycosidase mutants in which the catalytic nucleophile has been converted to a non-nucleophilic residue. These mutants catalyze the formation of glycosidic bonds when glycosyl fluorides with anomeric configuration opposite to that of the original substrate, thereby mimicking the glycosyl enzyme intermediate, are employed as substrates. The modified enzyme catalyzes the nucleophilic displacement of the fluoride via attack by a hydroxyl group on an added glycosyl acceptor, generating a new glycosidic bond with the same stereochemistry as the normal substrate. The reactions catalyzed by glycosynthases are highly amenable to industrial syntheses because of the high yields of products (70–95%), the relatively inexpensive and easily prepared substrates, and the high stabilities of the enzymes involved (9Perugino G. Trincone A. Rossi M. Moracci M. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 31-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Since the first report on a glycosynthase in 1998 (10Mackenzie L.F. Wang Q. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar), successful glycosynthases have been developed from 11 glycosidases belonging to seven different glycoside hydrolases (GH) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolases; Abg, Agrobacterium sp. β-glucosidase; Cel5A, β-1, 4-glucanase from C. fimi; CelB, P. furiosus β-glucosidase; Taβ-Gly, T. aggregans β-glycosidase; α-GalF, α-d-galactopyranosyl fluoride; α-GlcF, α-d-glucopyranosyl fluoride; α-ManF, α-d-mannopyranosyl fluoride; α-XylF, α-d-xylopyranosyl fluoride; MU-Glc, 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucopyranoside; pNP-Gal, 4-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside; pNP-Glc, 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside; pNP-Man, 4-nitrophenyl β-d-mannopyranoside; pNP-Xyl, 4-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside. families (9Perugino G. Trincone A. Rossi M. Moracci M. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 31-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). With the exception of a unique α-glycosynthase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (11Okuyama M. Mori H. Watanabe K. Kimura A. Chiba S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) all glycosynthases have originated from retaining β-glycosidases, and employ α-glycosyl fluorides as donors. Recently, β-glycosynthases were shown to use activated β-glycosides as donors at low pH in the presence of external nucleophiles, such as acetate or formate (12Perugino G. Trincone A. Giordano A. van der Oost J. Kaper T. Rossi M. Moracci M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8484-8493Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Trincone A. Giordano A. Perugino G. Rossi M. Moracci M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 4039-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This rescue of activity with external nucleophiles permits transglycosylation reactions to be performed via the formation of an intermediate α-glycosyl acetate or formate. The glycosynthase from Agrobacterium sp. β-glucosidase (Abg) was the first glycosynthase to be reported (10Mackenzie L.F. Wang Q. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and its utility has been extended to numerous applications (10Mackenzie L.F. Wang Q. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 14Howard S. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Johnson P.E. Brun E.

Chem. 2002; 67: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The first improvement of Abg glycosynthase activity was achieved by replacing alanine with serine at the nucleophile position 2The amino acid sequence numbering system used here is that which has been used throughout for this protein in which the N-terminal methionine (which is processed off in the mature protein) is not counted. This results in a numbering difference of 1 compared to that listed in GenBank™ (accession number M19033), thus the nucleophile of Abg is referred to as the 358th amino acid residue rather than the 359th (52Wakarchuk W.W. Greenberg N.M. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C.J. Warren R.A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 170: 301-307Crossref Google Scholar). (18Mayer C. Zechel D.L. Reid S.P. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Subsequently, using an “on-plate” screening method based on a coupled enzyme assay with an endocellulase, an improved new glycosynthase, AbgE358G with Gly at the nucleophile position, was discovered from a library of mutations at the catalytic nucleophile position (19Mayer C. Jakeman D.L. Mah M. Karjala G. Gal L. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the reactions catalyzed by these improved Abg glycosynthases are still slow relative to wild type glycosidase activities, requiring relatively large quantities of mutant enzyme and/or extended incubation times (9Perugino G. Trincone A. Rossi M. Moracci M. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 31-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Tolborg J.F. Petersen L. Jensen K.J. Mayer C. Jakeman D.L.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This has stimulated attempts to generate more active glycosynthase mutants. In this report, we present a modified screening method and its use on a mutated gene library to identify a mutant enzyme, designated 2F6, containing three additional mutations and a 27-fold enhancement in catalytic efficiency relative to the parental glycosynthase (AbgE358G) after two rounds of mutagenesis and screening. The enhanced activity also allows 2F6 to use other sugars as donors and acceptors. We also propose a structural basis for these activity changes based upon a suitable homology model. Construction of pGSVIII as a Screening Vector—The gene encoding the catalytic domain of cellulase D (Cel5A) from Cellulomonas fimi (20Meinke A. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1910-1918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using 1 μm T7 promoter primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) and the Cel5A-TERM primer (5′-CCCTCTAGATTAAAGCTTGACCTGCGAGATCGA), 0.2 mm each of the four dNTPs, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 25 ng of pGSVIICel5A (19Mayer C. Jakeman D.L. Mah M. Karjala G. Gal L. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), template DNA, and 2.5 units of Pwo polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) in 50 μl of 1× Pwo polymerase buffer. Twenty-five PCR cycles (45 s at 94, 30 s at 55, and 80 s at 72 °C) were performed in a thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, GeneAmp PCR System 2400). The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI and XbaI and then subcloned into pTKNd119, which carried the Bacillus licheniformis maltogenic amylase promoter (21Kim I.C. Cha J.H. Kim J.R. Jang S.Y. Seo B.C. Cheong T.K. Lee D.S. Choi Y.D. Park K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22108-22114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), multiple cloning sites, the hexahistidine tag sequence, T7 terminator, and the kanamycin resistance gene from pET29-b(+) (Novagen). The resulting plasmid was designated as pGSVIII and was used for the dual expression of the catalytic domain of Cel5A and His6-tagged Abg glycosynthase mutants in this study. Random Mutagenesis and Construction of Mutant Library—Random mutagenesis of the template gene was performed using unbalanced dNTP concentrations in the presence of MnCl2 (22Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The glycosynthase gene was amplified from pET29abgE358G with the T7 promoter primer and the Abg-TERM primer (5′-GGGCTCGAGTGCGGCCGCCTTGGCAACCCCATGGTT). The reaction mixture contained 100 ng of plasmid DNA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1–1 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm each of dATP and dGTP, 1 mm each of dCTP and dTTP, 0.2 μm each of primers, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) in a 50-μl reaction volume. Cycling parameters were 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR products were digested with XbaI and NotI, then extracted from agarose gel using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and ligated with pGSVIII that had been digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes. The resulting mutant library was transformed into One Shot® TOP10 chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (Novagen). Transformants were plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar media containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin (LBkan agar). Preparations of 2F61 and 2F62 Mutants—The nucleotides encoding Gln-248 of Abg are in the 800-bp DNA fragment between two EcoRV sites in the abg gene. To prepare the 2F61 mutant, the 800-bp DNA fragment of the 1D12 gene with Gln-248 was exchanged with that of the 2F6 gene containing the Q248R mutation using common DNA manipulation methods. The resulting plasmid was designated as pGSVIIIAbg2F61. Plasmid pGSVIIIAbg2F62 was made by the substitution of the EcoRV-digested DNA fragment of the abgE358G gene with Gln-248 for that of the 2F6 gene containing the Q248R mutation. Saturation Mutagenesis of Abg Glycosynthase—The saturation mutagenesis libraries at the positions of Ala-19, Gln-248, and Met-407 of AbgE358G were made individually using a four-primer method. The primers used in the Ala-19 library (A19X) were T7 promoter primer, Abg-TERM primer, A19X-forward primer (5′-GGCGATTTCCTGTTTGGCGTCNNKACTGCCTCG), and A19-reverse primer (5′-GACGCCAAACAGGAAATCGCC). T7 promoter primer and A19-reverse were used in one PCR, whereas A19X-forward and Abg-TERM primer were used in another. PCR products were purified by the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) on a 1% agarose gel. 20 ng of each quantitated PCR product was combined for a primer-less second PCR. After 10 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C) using Pwo polymerase, T7 promoter primer and Abg-TERM primer were added to a final concentration of 0.5 μm and the PCR was continued for a further 25 cycles. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pGSVIII using XbaI and NotI. Primers Gln248X-forward (5′-AAGGCGGCCGAGCGGGCCTTCNNKTTCCACAAT) and Gln-248-reverse (5′-GAAGGCCCGCTCGGCCGCCTT) were used for a Gln-248 library instead of primers A19X-forward and A19-reverse, respectively. M407X-forward (5′-GGTTATTTCGCCTGGAGCCTGNNKGATAATTTC) and M407-reverse (5′-CAGGCTCCAGGCGAAATAACC) were used for a Met-407 library. Plasmid pET29abgE358G was used as a template in all three libraries. Screening Mutant Library for Increased Activity—After overnight incubation, the cells were transferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Biosciences). To lyse the cell wall, the membranes were laid on a fresh LBkan agar plate with 0.15 mg/ml d-cycloserine. The plates were returned to a 37 °C incubator where they were kept for 15 h. Next, each membrane was wetted with 500 μl of substrate solution (12.5 mm α-d-glucopyranosyl fluoride (α-GlcF) and 1 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucopyranoside (MU-Glc)) and incubated at room temperature. The fluorescent signals from active clones were monitored under a UV light (395 nm) and the brightest clones (∼10 clones per 300 colonies) were then picked from master plates and transferred into 96-deep well culture tubes, each well containing 200 μl of LBkan. The primary screened clones were then incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 250 r.p.m. to allow for cell growth. Seventy-five microliters of each culture were transferred to new 96-well plates and the rest of the cultures were stored at 4 °C. Bacterial growth was quantified by reading the absorbance at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (SPECTRAMax plus, Molecular Devices Corp.). An equal volume (75 μl) of BugBuster™ protein extraction reagent (Novagen) with 0.1% (w/v) lysozyme (Sigma) was then added to each well and the plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature to lyse the cells. Next the crude extracts were mixed with an equal volume of assay solution (25 mm α-GlcF, 2 mm MU-Glc, 0.1 mg of Cel5A in 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0), and the release of methylumbelliferone (MU) was monitored at 30 °C using a Wallac 1420 VICTOR2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plate reader. Clones with higher activity than that of the parent clone in the secondary screening were purified and their improved activities were confirmed using the same conditions as those used for the secondary screening. Purification of Glycosynthase Mutant Enzymes—The Abg glycosynthase mutants were purified from E. coli TOP10 cells harboring the corresponding genes on pGSVIII by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), as described previously (18Mayer C. Zechel D.L. Reid S.P. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The desalting and the concentration of purified enzyme solutions were carried out using an Amicon Ultra-4 filter unit (10,000 Da, cut-off, Millipore). The buffer used in enzyme solutions was changed to 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Protein concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 102850 m–1 cm–1 (23Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Transglycosylation Kinetics of Glycosynthase—An Orion fluoride electrode (model 96–09BN), interfaced with a Fischer Scientific Accumet 925 pH/ion meter, was used to monitor fluoride release during reaction at 25 °C. All enzymatic rates were corrected for the spontaneous hydrolysis rate of the glycosyl fluoride. The concentration of either donor (50 mm) or acceptor (20 mm) sugar was fixed and that of the counterpart was varied to allow Km and kcat determinations. The apparent kcat/Km value of 2F6 for pNP-Xyl was determined from the slope of the plot of v versus [S] (Vo = kcatEo [S]/Km) measured at eight concentrations of pNP-Xyl from 1 to 20 mm at a fixed concentration of α-GalF (50 mm). GraFit version 4.0 (24Leatherbarrow, R. (1990) GraFit 4.0 Ed., Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UKGoogle Scholar) was used to calculate kinetic parameters by direct fit of initial rates. Oligonucleotide Synthesis and DNA Sequencing—The synthesis of PCR primers and the analysis of DNA sequences were carried out by the Nucleic Acid and Peptides Service Unit in the Biotechnology Laboratory at the University of British Columbia. Structure Modeling—The three-dimensional structures of Abg and the evolved mutants were modeled using the SWISS-MODEL version 3.51 program at the Expasy server (25Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Reported structures of β-glucosidases were used as modeling templates. The RCSB Protein Data Bank (26Berman H.M. Westbrook J.

Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). The figures were created with MOLSCRIPT version 2.1 (32Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and rendered using Raster3D (33Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). Modification of the Screening System—To improve the efficiency of formation of screenable mutant libraries, the previously developed two-plasmid screening method (19Mayer C. Jakeman D.L. Mah M. Karjala G. Gal L. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was slightly modified to minimize some earlier limitations. Previously, it had been necessary to use E. coli BL21(DE3) as a host cell and to employ isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction because the expression of the target gene was under T7 promoter control. Furthermore, the two plasmids for Cel5A and the glycosynthase had to both be transformed to produce these enzymes in cells simultaneously; and because Cel5A also contained a His6 tag, the two plasmids then had to be separated to purify the improved glycosynthase after screening. To overcome these limitations, the T7 promoter was changed to a constitutive B. licheniformis maltogenic amylase promoter (21Kim I.C. Cha J.H. Kim J.R. Jang S.Y. Seo B.C. Cheong T.K. Lee D.S. Choi Y.D. Park K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22108-22114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a single plasmid system was designed. In the single plasmid system, the gene for Cel5A was manipulated to produce Cel5A without a His6 tag followed by a second ribosome binding site, which originated from pET29 (Novagen), along with a His6-tagged glycosynthase mutant gene. Conveniently, both genes are transformed through a single transformation process and also expressed in any E. coli host cell without isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Glycosynthase mutants produced by the screened clones can be directly purified using nickel affinity chromatography. Random Mutagenesis and Screening—Error-prone PCR mutagenesis using MnCl2 and unbalanced dNTP concentrations was used to generate libraries of glycosynthase mutants (22Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the first generation, to optimize the concentration of MnCl2, the mutant genes were amplified at various MnCl2 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mm using the abgE358G gene as a template. About 90% of the clones in a mutant library made in the presence of 0.5 mm MnCl2 exhibited positive glycosynthase activity in the on-agar plate assay, and sequence analysis of 5 randomly selected clones in the library showed a nucleotide mutation ratio of ∼0.06%, which is an ideal mutagenesis ratio for directed evolution (one amino acid substitution per gene). After screening 10,000 colonies from the mutant library, only one mutant (1D12) was selected. Sequence analysis of 1D12 revealed one amino acid substitution, A19T. This substitution resulted in 3.5 times higher activity than that of AbgE358G in the screening assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The gene encoding 1D12 was then used as a template for generating the second generation error-prone PCR library under the same conditions (0.5 mm MnCl2) as the first generation. An additional improved mutant, 2F6, showing 1.5 times more activity than 1D12, was revealed after screening 10,000 colonies of the second library. The new mutant had acquired three mutations compared with the AbgE358G: it retained both amino acid substitutions of its parent, A19T and E358G, and acquired two additional mutations, Q248R and M407V. To allow analysis of individual mutations and see if any of these were silent, two new mutants, 2F61 (A19T, E358G, and Q248R) and 2F62 (A19T, E358G, and M407V), were prepared by recombination using restriction enzymes. In fact, both of these mutants were more active than 1D12 (1.1 and 1.2 times for 2F61 and 2F62, respectively) thus all three mutations acquired in the directed evolution process do indeed contribute to the increased glycosynthase activity. In an attempt to further improve activity, the three mutated sites were randomized individually by saturation mutagenesis (34Miyazaki K. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) using the abgE358G gene as a template. The screening of ∼900 colonies (∼300 colonies from each of the three saturation mutagenesis libraries) revealed no new mutation that satisfied the selection criteria. Only one mutant, A19X-40, which contained an A19S conversion, was identified as an improved mutant (2.5 times higher than AbgE358G), but its activity was less than that of 1D12 having the A19T mutation (Fig. 1). Improvement of Glycosynthase Activities—To compare the improved transglycosylation activity of two screened AbgE358G mutants, we investigated the kinetic parameters of these mutants with α-d-galactopyranosyl fluoride (α-GalF) as a donor and 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (pNP-Glc) as an acceptor. The use of α-GalF as a donor sugar for kinetic studies ensured that the observed release of fluoride corresponded to a single galactosyl transfer because the lactosyl product, with an axial 4′ hydroxyl, does not act as an acceptor. Upon varying the α-GalF concentration at a fixed concentration of pNP-Glc (20 mm) all three glycosynthases showed standard saturation kinetic behavior (Fig. 2). The catalytic turnover numbers (kcat) of two screened mutants were higher by 10- and 15-fold than that of AbgE358G (Table I). The Km value for α-GalF increased with the A19T mutation from 316 to 422 mm but decreased with the two additional mutations (Q248R and M407V) to 174 mm. Overall, the kcat/Km of Abg glycosynthase was improved 27-fold relative to that of AbgE358G through this directed evolution process.Table IAmino acid substitution and kinetic parameters of evolved Abg glycosynthase mutantsVariantAmino acid substitutionskcatKmkcat/Kmmin-1mmmin-1 mm-1AbgE358CaData from Ref. 19.E358CNDbND, not determined.ND0.018AbgE358AcData from Ref. 18.E358ANDND0.034AbgE358ScData from Ref. 18.E358S1772200.80AbgE358GaData from Ref. 19.E358G2101181.8AbgE358GE358G5513161.71D12+ A19T495842211.72F6+ Q248R, M407V828217447.3a Data from Ref. 19Mayer C.

Open table in a new tab Acceptor Specificity—To investigate the effect of the triple mutations on the acceptor specificity of the glycosynthase, kinetic parameters were determined for various acceptor sugars that have an equatorial hydroxyl group at the 4-position, using a fixed donor sugar concentration (α-GalF, 50 mm). The values of kcat for all acceptor sugars increased more than 10 times relative to that of AbgE358G (Table II). In the case of pNP-Glc, both AbgE358G and 2F6 suffered substrate inhibition, but 2F6 was inhibited less than AbgE358G (the values of Ki for AbgE358G and 2F6 were 7 and 24 mm, respectively). In the case of 4-nitrophenyl β-d-mannopyranoside (pNP-Man), standard saturation kinetic behavior was observed for AbgE358G with the kcat for 2F6 being 10 times higher than that of AbgE358G. Km values for pNP-Glc and pNP-Man did not change significantly. By contrast, Km values for 2F6 with 4-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside (pNP-Xyl) dramatically increased, so saturation kinetics were not observed, despite the kcat/Km value increasing from 5.5 to 74 min–1 mm–1.Table IIComparison of the kinetic parameters of AbgE358G and 2F6 for various acceptors with α-GalF fixed at 50 mmMutantAcceptorkcatKmkcat/KmBehavior (at high substrate concentration)min-1mmmin-1 mm-1AbgE358GpNP-Glc310 ± 10745 ± 186.9Substrate inhibition Ki = 7 ± 3 mmpNP-Man25 ± 122 ± 21.1SaturationpNP-Xyl50 ± 39 ± 15.5Saturation2F6pNP-Glc4498 ± 94231 ± 8145.1Substrate inhibition Ki = 24 ± 7 mmpNP-Man278 ± 1425 ± 211.1SaturationpNP-XylNDaND, not determined.ND74Lineara ND, not determined.

For several substrates, it has been shown that the first ubiquitin moiety is conjugated to the N-terminal residue. In all these substrates, however, the internal lysines also played a role in modulating their stability. To better understand the physiological significance of this novel mode of modification, it was important to identify proteins in which degradation is completely dependent on N-terminal ubiquitination. Also, although the experimental evidence for N-terminal ubiquitination is rather strong, nevertheless, it has remained indirect. Here we demonstrate that an important group of proteins that are targeted via N-terminal ubiquitination are the naturally occurring lysine-less proteins such as the human papillomavirus (HPV)-58 E7 oncoprotein and the cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor p16INK4a. For these proteins, the only residue that can be targeted is the N-terminal residue. Interestingly, p16INK4a is degraded in a cell density-dependent manner. Importantly, we provide for the first time direct evidence for N-terminal ubiquitination. Analysis of tryptic digest of the ubiquitin conjugate of HPV-58 E7 revealed a fusion peptide that is composed of the C-terminal domain of ubiquitin and the N-terminal domain of E7. With the abundance of native lysine-less proteins, among which are important viral and cell regulators, this novel mode of protein targeting has implications for both physiological and pathophysiological processes.

With the abundance of native lysine-less proteins, among which are important viral and cell regulators, this novel mode of protein targeting has implications for both physiological and pathophysiological processes. Ubiquitin modification of cellular proteins plays important roles in a variety of basic cellular processes. In many cases, modification by ubiquitin signals proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Conjugation of ubiquitin to the target substrate involves activation of ubiquitin by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; LL, lysine-less; MeUb, methylated ubiquitin; WT, wild type; HPV, human papillomavirus; E7, HPV oncoprotein; LMP, latent membrane protein; Id, inhibitor of differentiation (or inhibitor of DNA binding); HA, hemagglutinin; NOLLP, naturally occurring lysine-less protein; TEV, tobacco etch virus; MG132, N-carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-leucinal; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. followed by its transfer to a member of the ubiquitin carrier protein E2 family of enzymes. In most studied cases, E2 transfers the activated ubiquitin either directly or indirectly to an ϵ-NH2 group of an internal lysine residue in the substrate that is specifically bound to E3, a member of the ubiquitin-protein ligase family of proteins. Subsequent conjugation of additional activated ubiquitin molecules to previously attached molecules generates the polyubiquitin chain that serves as a degradation signal for the 26 S proteasome (reviewed in Ref. 1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). For several proteins, however, it was suggested that the first ubiquitin is conjugated to the N-terminal residue rather than to an internal lysine (reviewed in Ref. 2Ciechanover A. Ben-Saadon R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 103-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Replacement of all the lysine residues in the muscle-specific transcription factor MyoD (3Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) only slightly affected its ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that an alternative ubiquitin docking site must exist. Degradation of the lysine-less (LL) protein in cells was inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, and inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of ubiquitin-MyoD conjugates. In vitro, LL MyoD was polyubiquitinated, and this modification was required for its degradation; proteolysis was inhibited by the ubiquitin chain terminator methylated ubiquitin (MeUb), a ubiquitin derivative in which all internal lysine residues are modified, and therefore it cannot polymerize (4Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In agreement with the results obtained with the LL MyoD, selective chemical modification of all internal lysines of MyoD by guanidination affected proteolysis only slightly. In striking contrast, selective modification of its N-terminal group by carbamoylation almost completely blocked degradation. Fusion of a Myc6 tag to the N-terminal residue of WT MyoD stabilized the protein both in vivo and in vitro (3Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These findings rule out the possibility that substitution of all the internal lysine residues “forced” ubiquitination at the N-terminal residue that would not have otherwise occurred. N-terminal tagging probably stabilizes MyoD by blocking access of ubiquitin to the specific ubiquitination site at the N terminus; however, it can also affect recognition of the substrate by the E3 by altering the structure of the N-terminal domain. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the first event in ubiquitin-mediated degradation of MyoD involves fusion of ubiquitin to the N-terminal residue. Additional ubiquitin moieties are then added to Lys48 of the previously conjugated moiety (3Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Using a similar set of experiments, seven additional proteins have been recently identified that possibly traverse the N-terminal ubiquitination pathway: (i) the human papillomavirus-16 (HPV-16) oncoprotein E7 (5Reinstein E. Scheffner M. Oren M. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5944-5950Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a potent transforming protein (see also below); (ii) the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) (6Aviel S. Winberg G. Massucci M. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23491-23499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and (iii) LMP2A (7Ikeda M. Ikeda A. Longnecker R. Virology. 2002; 300: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) of the Epstein-Barr virus, two multiple transmembrane-spanning proteins involved in the regulation of B cell receptor-mediated signal transduction and viral activation from latency; (iv) the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (8Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 9Coulombe P. Rodier G. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6140-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); (v) the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) (9Coulombe P. Rodier G. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6140-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); and the inhibitors of differentiation (or inhibitors of DNA binding) (vi) (10Fajerman I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and (vii) Id1 (11Trausch-Azar J.S. Lingbeck J. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32614-32619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), two pro-proliferative helix-loop-helix proteins that lack the basic DNA-binding domain. These two proteins repress transcription by generating transcriptionally inactive heterodimers, primarily with E proteins, which act as dominant negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix proteins. It has been recently reported that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the first critical enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, may also be ubiquitinated on the N terminus (12Doolman R. Leichner G.S. Avner R. Roitelman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (July 7, 10.1074/jbc.M405935200)Google Scholar). This finding, however, and the essentiality of the modification for degradation of the protein still need further substantiation. The case of p21 attracted special attention because it was shown earlier that a mutant lysine-less p21 is still degraded by the proteasome without prior ubiquitination. This finding suggested that, similar to ornithine decarboxylase, p21 is also degraded in a manner that is ubiquitination-independent yet proteasome-dependent (13Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The new findings suggest that this may not be the case, and the protein must be ubiquitinated probably on its N-terminal residue prior to its recognition and degradation by the 26 S proteasome. It should be noted that although the internal lysine residues are not essential for degradation of MyoD, they nevertheless play a modulating role. Thus, the LL MyoD is ubiquitinated less efficiently then its WT counterpart, and its degradation is slowed by ∼2-fold (3Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Is there a direct evidence for N-terminal ubiquitination of a native cellular substrate? Apparently there is not. Although all the different and independent lines of experimental evidence presented in the various studies strongly suggest that ubiquitination occurs on the N-terminal residue, the only direct evidence will be the demonstration of a fusion peptide between the C-terminal domain of ubiquitin and the N-terminal domain of the substrate. Such a fusion fragment has not yet been identified. For p21 it has been shown that ubiquitination must occur in the N-terminal domain (8Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (see also under “Discussion”), and a fusion peptide has been identified for N-terminally HA-tagged p21 (see Ref. 9Coulombe P. Rodier G. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6140-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, which was published in parallel with the on-line version of this study), but direct evidence for modification of the N-terminal residue of the native protein is still missing. The physiological significance of N-terminal ubiquitination is not yet clear because all of the studied proteins contain internal lysines that can still be ubiquitinated. An important group of potential substrates for N-terminal ubiquitination is that of naturally occurring lysine-less proteins (NOLLPs). Because these proteins cannot use the “canonical” lysine conjugation pathway, to be targeted by the ubiquitin system they must use an alternative site for their tagging. Searching the data base, we were able to identify 178 eukaryotic NOLLPs of which 15 are human; in addition, we have identified 111 viral NOLLPs. Here we report on two of these proteins, the human tumor supressor p16INK4a and the viral oncoprotein HPV-58 E7. p16INK4a is a well characterized tumor suppressor that acts as a specific inhibitor of D-type cyclin-dependent kinases (reviewed in Ref. 14Sherr C.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Its expression enhances the growth-suppressive function of the retinoblastoma protein, thus arresting cells in early G1. In contrast, inactivation of p16INK4a has been implicated in the deregulation of the cell cycle and, therefore, in the pathogenesis of different tumors such as malignant melanoma (15Sharpless E. Chin L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical properties and the interactions of p16INK4a with other cell cycle regulators have been studied extensively, little is known about its regulation. It is generally believed that the ability of p16INK4a to inhibit Cdk4 is regulated only by the abundance of the proteins (16Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that p16INK4a is phosphorylated (17Gump J. Stokoe D. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6619-6622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the only known post-translational modification that this protein undergoes; however, the role of this modification has remained obscure. The E7 oncoprotein of the high risk HPV is a potent transforming protein that can immortalize various human cell types either alone or, in higher efficiency, in cooperation with HPV-E6. It has been associated etiologically with the pathogenesis of human uterine cervical cancer (reviewed in Refs. 18Munger K. Howley P.M. Virus Res. 2002; 89: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar and 19zur Hausen H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that both p16INK4a and HPV-58 E7 are degraded by the ubiquitin system. Importantly, we have identified the fusion peptide between the C-terminal domain of ubiquitin and the N-terminal domain of HPV-58 E7, thus providing for the first time direct evidence for the attachment of ubiquitin to the N-terminal residue of a target substrate. Interestingly, we demonstrate that p16INK4a is ubiquitinated and degraded only in sparse cells and is stable in dense cells. Materials for SDS-PAGE and the Bradford reagent were from Bio-Rad.

Identification of NOLLPs in the Protein Data Base—The UniProt data base (www.uniprot.org/) was scanned (in January 2004) for full-length lysine-less proteins. Short (less than 50 residues) and prokaryotic entries were filtered out. Plasmids and Construction of Mutant cDNAs—HPV-58 E7 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a plink322 vector containing the complete HPV-58 genome (kindly received from Dr. Toshihiko Matsukura, Laboratory of Tumor Viruses, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) and subcloned into the XhoI-XbaI site of the mammalian expression vector pCS2+ upstream of the cytomegalovirus and SP6 promoters. This vector was used for expression of the protein in COS-7 cells and for in vitro translation. For expression in Escherichia coli, the cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the NdeI-BamHI site of the bacterial expression vector pT7-7. A His6 tag was added at the C terminus into the BamHI site by PCR. A mutant HPV-58 E7-His in which we substituted the Arg residue in position 2 with His (HPV-58 E7-His R2H) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. A TEV protease cleavage site (Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-↓-Gly-Ser) was inserted by PCR into HPV-58 E7-His (cloned into the pT7-7 vector) after either the first (Met, designated HPV-58 E7-TEV1) or the 21st (Asp, designated HPV-58 E7-TEV21) residue. All sequences were confirmed using the ABI 310 automatic sequencer. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Rosetta™-(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells (Novagen) induced by isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside were used for bacterial expression of HPV-58 E7. Purification of His6-tagged HPV-58 E7-R2H and HPV-58 E7-TEV1 and E7-TEV21 proteins was performed using immobilized nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Lines and Transfection—COS-7 and HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). Transient transfections were carried out using the jetPEI™ transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cells were analyzed after 24–48 h. Stability of Proteins in Cells—Cellular stability (t½) of HPV-58 E7 was monitored using a cycloheximide chase. At time 0, cells were harvested or further incubated for 3 h in the presence of cycloheximide (100 μg/ml). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm) was added 1 h prior to the addition of cycloheximide and was present throughout the experiment. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture set I), and protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of protein were resolved via SDS-PAGE (15%). The gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and proteins were detected by ECL following incubation with anti-E7 antibody and an appropriate secondary antibody. Cellular stability of p16 was monitored in a pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation experiment. HeLa cells expressing endogenous p16 were incubated for 1 h in a methionine- and cysteine-free medium followed by a 1-h labeling (pulse) with 0.17 mCi/ml of [35S]methionine and cysteine mixture (PRO-MIX, Amersham Biosciences). Decay of the labeling (chase) was monitored in a complete medium containing 2 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine for the indicated time periods. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm) was added for the last 30 min of the labeling period and was present throughout the experiment. After labeling, cells were harvested and lysed, and the labeled proteins were precipitated using anti-p16 antibody. Immune complexes were collected using immobilized protein A. Following SDS-PAGE (15%), proteins were visualized by a PhosphorImager. Demonstration of p16INK4a Ubiquitin Conjugates in Cells—Ubiquitin conjugates of p16 were detected in cells using a lysis procedure that inhibits the activity of ubiquitin proteases as follows. HeLa cells expressing endogenous p16 were incubated for 3 h in the presence or absence of 20 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132. Following incubation, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture set I, all of which were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and heated to 95 °C. The lysates were then boiled for 5 min, sheared by a syringe equipped with a 25-gauge needle, boiled again for 3 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was diluted 2-fold with a buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture set I in 1% bovine serum albumin. p16 was immunoprecipitated using anti-p16 antibody and immobilized protein A. The immune complexes were resolved via SDS-PAGE (15%), and after Western blot, proteins were visualized using an anti-ubiquitin antibody or anti-p16 antibody. In Vitro Translation of HPV-58 E7—The HPV-58 E7 cDNA was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using wheat germ-coupled transcription-translation extract and SP6 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conjugation and Degradation Assays—Conjugation and degradation assays in reconstituted cell-free systems were performed essentially as described previously (3Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures contained crude HeLa cell extract (50 μg of protein), 5 μg of ubiquitin, and in vitro translated HPV-58 E7 (∼25,000 cpm) in a final volume of 12.5 μl. Degradation reactions were carried out in the presence of either 0.5 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (10 mm phosphocreatine and 0.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase) or 0.5 μg of hexokinase and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose to deplete endogenous ATP. Conjugation reactions were carried out in the presence of the isopeptidase inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde (0.5 μg) and either ATPγS or 0.5 μg of hexokinase and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose to deplete endogenous ATP. 5 μg of MeUb were added where indicated. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 7.0 μl of 3-fold concentrated sample buffer. After boiling, reaction mixtures were resolved via SDS-PAGE (15%), and gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Ubiquitination at the N-terminal Residue as Demonstrated by TEV Proteolysis—125I-MeUb was prepared using the chloramine-T method as described previously (22Ferber S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3128-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conjugation of bacterially expressed C-terminally His6-tagged HPV-58 E7-TEV1 and -TEV21 (∼1 μg) proteins was carried out in a cell-free reconstituted system containing crude HeLa cell extract and 125I-MeUb (∼2.0 × 105 cpm/2 μg) (added instead of WT ubiquitin) as described above. ATPγS was added as indicated. Following incubation, the free proteins and the conjugates were isolated using Ni2+-agarose beads. Cleavage by the TEV protease was carried out at 30 °C for 2 h using the Ni2+-immoblized E7 as a substrate in the presence of TEV buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol and 1% Triton X-100) and in the presence or absence of 10 units of the TEV protease. Reactions were resolved via SDS-PAGE (18%), and proteins were visualized by PhosphorImager. Conjugation and Isolation of HPV-58 E7 for Analysis via Mass Spectrometry—40 μg of bacterially expressed and purified C-terminally His-tagged HPV-58 E7-R2H were incubated in a 500-μl scaled-up in vitro ubiquitination reaction that also contained MeUb as described above. Following conjugation, 500 μl of dilution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole) was added, and the His-tagged protein was purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Following SDS-PAGE (15%), proteins were visualized via Coomassie Blue staining (SeeBand Forte). Bands representing free and conjugated HPV-58 R2H were excised from the gel and analyzed by MS. In-gel Proteolysis and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Excised gel bands (see above) were reduced in-gel (with 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubation at 60 °C for 30 min), alkylated (using 10 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min), and digested with trypsin (overnight at 37 °C using modified trypsin (Promega) at a 1:100 enzyme to substrate ratio). The resulting tryptic peptides were resolved by reversephase chromatography on 0.1 × 300-mm fused silica capillaries (J&W Scientific) packed with POROUS R2–10 reversed phase material (Applied Biosystems). The peptides were eluted with a linear 50 min gradient of 5–95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water at a flow rate of 0.4 μl/min. Mass spectrometry was performed by an ion-trap mass spectrometer (LCQ-DecaXP, Finnigan, San Jose, CA) in a positive ionization mode using repetitively full MS scan followed by collision-induced dissociation of the three most dominant ions selected from the first MS scan. The identity of the peptides was further confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-time-of-flight MS (4700, Applied Biosystems). The MS data were analyzed using the Sequest software. 2J. Eng and J. Yates, unpublished data. The NOLLP HPV-58 E7 Is Targeted by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System in Vitro and in Vivo—Once HPV-58 E7 had been identified as a NOLLP (Fig. 1A), it was important to examine whether it is degraded by the ubiquitin system. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, HPV-58 E7 is polyubiquitinated in a cell-free system, and the reaction requires energy. The finding that the modification is dependent on ATPγS, a derivative of ATP that can activate E1 via cleavage of the β-γ bond but cannot release the γPi group, demonstrates that ubiquitination does not require phosphorylation. Because ubiquitination does not necessarily signal the target protein for degradation, it was important to demonstrate that, in this case, it serves as a recognition motif for the 26 S proteasome and leads to destruction of the protein. As can be seen in the experiment described in Fig. 1C, degradation of HPV-58 E7 is dependent on the presence of both ATP and ubiquitin. Addition of the chain terminator MeUb competed with the endogenous ubiquitin in the HeLa extract and inhibited the degradation of E7 significantly. Addition of excess WT ubiquitin that competes with the derivatized ubiquitin for activation by E1 alleviated the inhibition, and degradation resumed. Next we examined whether the degradation of HPV-58 E7 is carried out by the proteasome in cells. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the protein is degraded in cells and has a half-life of ∼20 min. Addition of MG132, an inhibitor of the proteasome, completely blocked degradation. The NOLLP p16INK4a Is Targeted by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System in Vivo and Its Degradation Is Cell Density-dependent—We next examined whether the degradation of another NOLLP, the tumor suppressor protein p16INK4a (Fig. 3A), is mediated by the proteasome following its ubiquitination. Our initial experiments revealed that the protein is stable in nonsynchronized cells. To examine weather the level of p16 is regulated during the cell cycle, we used a double thymidine block (23Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) to arrest HeLa cells in G1/S phase. We could not observe any oscillations in the abundance of p16 during the cell cycle (data not shown). This finding was consistent with the observation that the level of the highly related cell cycle inhibitor p19INK4d changes dramatically during the cell cycle and in correlation with its very short half-life (24Thullberg M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2870-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas p16INK4a is a much more stable protein (26Yanagisawa K. Kosaka A. Iwahana H. Nakanishi M. Tominaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported up-regulation of p16INK4a in response to contact inhibition of growth (see for example Refs. 25Wieser R.J. Faust D. Dietrich C. Oesch F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Yanagisawa K. Kosaka A. Iwahana H. Nakanishi M. Tominaga S. J. Biochem.

We decided therefore to examine whether the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the cell density-dependent regulation of p16INK4a. Indeed, we noted that the steady-state level of p16 changes with cell density; that is, the sparser the cells, the lower the level of the protein (Fig. 3B). This finding could be attributed to density-dependent alteration in the transcription of the mRNA or translation of the protein, or to a change in the stability o"

To follow expression of the Gfi1 gene during the differentiation of specific immune cells, we have generated a mouse mutant in which the Gfi1 coding region is replaced by the gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP). We found that Gfi1 gene expression is highest in early B-cell subpopulation and differentially expressed during T-cell development with peak levels at stages where pre-TCR or positive/negative selection takes place. Gfi1 is absent in mature B-cells, whereas in peripheral T-cells Gfi1 gene expression is low but rises significantly upon T-cell receptor triggering and decreases again in T-memory cells. Constitutive expression of an lck promoter-driven Gfi1 transgene led to transcriptional silencing of the Gfi1:GFP allele in T-cells. Because Gfi1 was found to occupy genomic sites of its own promoter in thymocytes and was able to repress its own transcription in vitro we propose that transcription of the Gfi1 gene is regulated through an autoregulatory feedback loop.

The Gfi1 gene was first discovered during analysis of proviral integration sites and their associated target genes in the NB2 rat lymphoma cell line after retroviral infection with the non-acute transforming Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) 1The abbreviations used are: MoMuLV, moloney murine leukemia virus; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; TCR, T-cell receptor; DN, double negative; DP, double positive; SP, single positive; Lin, lineage; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; wt, wild type; IP, immunoprecipitation; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; LC, large cycling cells; SR, small resting cells. 1The abbreviations used are: MoMuLV, moloney murine leukemia virus; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; TCR, T-cell receptor; DN, double negative; DP, double positive; SP, single positive; Lin, lineage; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; wt, wild type; IP, immunoprecipitation; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; LC, large cycling cells; SR, small resting cells.

In similar experiments, the Gfi1 gene was found to be transcriptionally activated by proviral insertion in T-lymphoid tumors that arose in normal and tumor-prone transgenic mice after infection with MoMuLV (2Scheijen B. Jonkers J. Acton D. Berns A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schmidt T. Zörnig M. Beneke R. Möröy T.

These findings suggested a function of Gfi1 as a dominant protooncogene, which was supported by studies with transgenic mice constitutively overexpressing Gfi1 in T-cells (5Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Gau E. Zevnik B. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2661-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Gfi1 gene encodes a 55-kDa nuclear protein that harbors six C-terminal C2-H2 zinc finger domains and a characteristic N-terminal 20-amino acid stretch that was termed “SNAG” domain, because it is well conserved between Gfi1 and the proteins Snail and Slug, which also bear similar zinc finger domains (6Grimes H.L. Chan T.O. Zweidler-McKay P.A. Tong B. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Gfi1 binds to specific DNA sequences, and this ability depends on the presence of some but not all of its zinc finger domains. Experiments with reporter genes driven by synthetic promoters with upstream Gfi1 binding sites suggested a transcriptional repressor activity of Gfi1, and further mutational studies clearly delineated that this activity depends on the DNA-binding activity of Gfi1 and on an intact N-terminal SNAG domain (6Grimes H.L. Chan T.O. Zweidler-McKay P.A. Tong B. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 7Zweidler-McKay P.A. Grimes H.L. Flubacher M.M. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4024-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Protein and RNA analyses showed that Gfi1 is expressed during T-cell development beginning at early stages of pre-T-cell selection until the point where T-cells express both CD4 and CD8 surface markers (8Karsunky H. Mende I. Schmidt T. Möröy T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Rödel B. Zevnik B. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In more mature, CD4 or CD8 single positive (SP) T-cells, Gfi1 is not readily detected but can be induced by stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) (8Karsunky H. Mende I. Schmidt T. Möröy T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whether the earliest CD4-CD8- (DN) precursor cells that enter the thymus from the bone marrow and bear the surface markers CD44 (termed DN1 cells) or CD44 and CD25 (termed DN2 cells) express Gfi1 is presently not known. When DN2 cells enter the cell cycle and start to rearrange their TCRβ, γ, and δ chain genes (10Fehling H.J. von Boehmer H.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Godfrey D.I. Kennedy J. Suda T. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar), CD44 expression decreases and DN2 cells differentiate into the CD25+/CD44-,lo subset. These “DN3” cells express Gfi1 (9Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Rödel B. Zevnik B. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), are strongly proliferating, and can be considered to represent the main source of cells populating the entire thymus. DN3 cells undergo pre-TCR selection (also termed “β-selection”) (12Dudley E.C. Petri H.T. Shah L.M. Owen M.J. Hayday A.C. Immunity. 1994; 1: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 13Hoffmann E.S. Passoni L. Crompton T. Leu T.M.U. Schatz D.G. Koff A. Owen M.J. Hayday A.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 948-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar); a process in which only those DN3 cells survive that have productively rearranged their TCR β-chain gene segments; other DN3 cells are eliminated by apoptosis. How Gfi1 expression is regulated during these very early steps of T-cell differentiation remains to be elucidated. Selected DN3 cells undergo a number of cell divisions before they rearrange and express the TCR-α gene locus. Subsequently, DN3 cells down-regulate CD25 and become CD25-/CD44-,lo (DN4) cells and soon start to express the surface markers and co-receptors CD4 and CD8 giving rise to the major DP T-cell population, which constitute over 80% of all cells in the thymus (10Fehling H.J. von Boehmer H.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Godfrey D.I. Kennedy J. Suda T. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). Independently of MHC class type, TCR signaling leads first to a loss or a reduction of co-receptor expression and generates a CD4loCD8lo subpopulation. These cells are thought to be subject to positive/negative selection that ensures the elimination of self-reactive T-cells and the propagation of self-tolerant T-cells (14Guidos C.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Germain R.N. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 5: 309-322Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 16Saito T. Watanabe N. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 359-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with Gfi1-deficient mice or lck-Gfi1 transgenic animals that overexpress Gfi1 constitutively in T-cells suggested that Gfi1 is involved in the cytokine-dependent progression of DN1 cells to the DN2 stage and that Gfi1 plays a role in the pre-TCR-mediated progression of cells through the DN3 stage (9Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Rödel B. Zevnik B. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Yücel R. Karsunky H. Klein-Hitpass L. Möröy T. J. Exp.

Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 2-10Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, Gfi1 knock-out mice showed a bias in the CD4/CD8 lineage decision and in the process of positive selection toward a preferred development of CD8+ cells (17Yücel R. Karsunky H. Klein-Hitpass L. Möröy T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A result of these numerous defects in T-cell development, Gfi1-deficient mice show a severe reduction of thymic cellularity (17Yücel R. Karsunky H. Klein-Hitpass L. Möröy T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similar to the development of T-cells, mature B-cells are generated from precursor cells through a series of developmental steps (18Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 595-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). In the earlier phases of B-cell development, precursor cells require cytokines and the appropriate stromal environment, but at later stages more mature cells undergo selection steps that are governed by a pre-B-cell receptor consisting of a μ chain and the surrogate light chains λ5 and V pre-B or the mature BCR complex made up by immunoglobulin heavy and light chains and associated membrane proteins (18Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 595-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The different stages of B-cell development can be defined by expression of the surface markers c-kit, B220, CD43, and CD25. Expression of Gfi1 has been documented in bone marrow, where B-cell development takes place but a cell typespecific or developmentally regulated expression of Gfi1 in this compartment has not been elucidated yet. The transcriptional regulation of the Gfi1 gene during T- or B-cell development is presently unknown. To investigate this in more detail, we generated a mouse “knock-in” mutant by gene targeting that carries the coding region of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the Gfi1 locus. By following the intensity of green fluorescence we were able to monitor Gfi1 gene expression during lymphocyte development and to gain more insight into the regulatory mechanisms of transcriptional control at the Gfi1 locus. Generation of Gfi1:GFP Knock-in Mice—Gfi1GFP/+neo mice were generated by homologous recombination in R1 ES cells using procedures that have been described previously. Transfection of ES cells and selection of clones was performed essentially as described before (20Karsunky H. Zeng H. Schmidt T. Zevnik B. Kluge R. Schmid K.W. Dührsen U. Möröy T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Mice were housed at the animal facility of the Institut für Zellbiologie, University of Essen Medical School in single ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions according to German animal legislation. Mice that were used for analyses were healthy 4- to 6-week-old animals from a backcross of several generations with C57BL/6 animals. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Single cell suspensions were prepared as described (9Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Rödel B. Zevnik B. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) at the time of autopsy from thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, or bone marrow in PBS supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (staining solution). Cell numbers were calculated using a CASY-1 cell counter (Schärfe System), were washed in this solution, and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min with antibodies that were biotinylated or directly conjugated with fluorochromes. All data were collected on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and were analyzed with CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo (TreeStar) software. To analyze the thymic DN population, lineage marker-negative cells (Lin-) were selected by staining thymocytes with the biotinylated antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, B220, Gr-1, Mac-1, Ter-119, and DX5, followed by Streptavidin-PerCP-Cy5.5, APC-, or PE-labeled anti-CD25 and anti-CD44 antibodies. PerCP-Cy5.5-negative cells (Lin-) were analyzed for expression of CD44 versus CD25. All antibodies used in FACS analysis were purchased from BD Biosciences. Splenic T- and B-cell Cultures—Splenic T-cells were purified from single cell suspension of Gfi1:GFP knock-in and wild type mice with the Pan T-Cell Isolation kit by using the auto-MACS system from Miltenyi Biotec. Isolation of the T-cells was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell cultures were set up with 2 × 106 cells in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin G, streptomycin, and 2-mercaptoethanol. B-cell cultures were performed from T-cell-depleted splenocytes and stimulated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml LPS from Escherichia coli (Sigma-Aldrich), whereas purified splenic T-cells were cultured for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h in the presence of 2 μg/ml α-CD3 (500A2 or 2C11) and α-CD28 (37.51) or concanavalin A (Sigma-Aldrich). Formaldehyde Cross-linking and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation— Chromatin was prepared as described with some modifications shown below (21Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Thymocytes from wt of Gfi1-deficient mice (7 × 107) were resuspended in cold PBS and fixed by adding 1/10 volume of 11% formaldehyde (HCHO) solution (prepared freshly from 37% HCHO stock solution, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Fixation was terminated after 1 h by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were collected by centrifugation, rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and washed sequentially for 15 min each with washing buffer A (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and with washing buffer B (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). The final pellets were resuspended in immunoprecipitation (IP)-Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 3% bovine serum albumin) containing protease inhibitors, and the chromatin were sonicated using a microtip until the average size of the DNA fragments was 500–700 bp. The sonicated DNA was then immunoprecipitated in IP-Nonidet P-40 buffer using 20 μg of α-Gfi1 antibody that was previously described (9Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Rödel B. Zevnik B. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose beads pre-blocked with sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Recovered immunocomplexes were washed six times for 15 min in IP-Nonidet P-40 buffer, once in high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm EDTA) and twice in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl). Protein-DNA complexes were finally eluted twice in 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA) with 1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde cross-links were reversed as shown below. DNase-free RNase A at 50 μg/ml was added to the eluate, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After addition of Proteinase K (500 μg/ml), the samples were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C followed by at least 6 h at 65 °C to completely reverse the cross-links. Samples were phenol/chloroform- and chloroform-extracted, followed by a standard ethanol precipitation (using 20 μg of glycogen as carrier). DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of TE and analyzed by using PCR. Prior to the immunoprecipitations, 100 μl of lysate was used to prepare total input DNA in essence as described above. PCR reactions contained 2 μl of immunoprecipitate or diluted total input. Primers used for DNA amplification of the Gfi1 locus were as indicated in Fig. 6. After 32–35 cycles of amplification, PCR products were run on 1.5% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—The Gfi1 promoter sequence was amplified by PCR using the primer pair indicated in Fig. 6 and Vent-polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR product was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and ligated into the SmaI-linearized luciferase vector pGl3-Basic. 5 × 104 NIH-3T3 cells per well were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of luciferase construct and the indicated amount of a CMV-driven Gfi1-FLAG expression plasmid 24 h later using Rotifect according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of DNA was kept constant in each transfection by adding empty CMV-FLAG vector where necessary. All DNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing. After 48 h, cells were lysed at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The luciferase activity was measured by luminometry after diluting the lysate 1:3 or 1:5 in 25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 15 mm K2HPO4, 4 mm EGTA, 40 μm ATP, 40 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 μg/ml luciferin. Expression of Gfi1 or Gfi1 mutants was confirmed by immunoblotting using the Gfi1-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody described before (9Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Rödel B. Zevnik B. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Freshly prepared thymocytes of wt, Gfi1+/GFP, and Gfi1GFP/GFP were fixed using Roti-Histofix (4.5% formaldehyde, Roth, Germany). After washing with PBS, cells were stained with α-GFP antibody. To detect GFP, thymocytes were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody, and nuclear staining was done with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The cells were then analyzed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510) and software (both from Zeiss, Germany). Cell Sorting, RNA Isolation, and Real-time PCR—DN, DP, CD8+, and CD4+ thymocytes were sorted by using a FACSDiVa™ (BD Biosciences), and splenic T-cells were sorted by using the magnetic cell separation system (auto-MACS, Miltenyi Biotec). peqGOLD RNA-pure™ (Peqlab) was applied using glycogen as a carrier and reducing all reagents to half of the amounts given in the standard protocol. 5 × 105 cells were used for each RT reaction. Before RT reactions were started, RNA was treated with DNaseI (Promega) (1 unit for 30 min at 37 °C). RT-PCR was performed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 900 nm of each primer, 250 nm TaqMan probe, and 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (ABI, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were monitored in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). For Gfi1 (Mm00515853_m1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Mm99999915_g1) Assays on Demand (ABI, Germany) were used. To amplify GFP mRNA, specific primers were designed using the Assays by Design FileBuilder software (Applied Biosystems) (forward: GGACGACGGCAACTACAAGA; reverse: TCAGCTCGATGCGGTTCAC; probe: AAGTTCGAGGGCGACACC). To correct for the amount of cDNA added to any individual reaction, PCR was performed in duplicates. The expression of the gene of interest was calculated relative to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and was expresses a Δct values. A correction factor was calculated by comparing Gfi1 and GFP standard curves with different numbers of thymocytes and was used in the final calculation of relative mRNA levels of Gfi1 and GFP genes. Generation and Functional Testing of the Gfi1:GFP Knock-in Mouse—We have used homologous recombination to generate a reporter mouse line in which parts of the Gfi1 coding region were replaced by a cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). The GFP gene was inserted in-frame with the ATG translation initiation codon of Gfi1, thereby placing it under the transcriptional control of the Gfi1 regulatory elements. The targeting construct was designed to replace exons 3–5 of Gfi1 by GFP and included a selectable marker gene (Neo) flanked by loxP sites (Fig. 1a). Heterozygous Gfi1+/GFPneo knock-in mice were mated with CMV-Cre transgenic mice to remove the neomycin resistance gene in the offspring at the germ line level. The successful deletion of the Neo cassette was monitored by Southern hybridization (Fig. 1b). As expected from experiments with previously described mice that were heterozygous for the Gfi1 allele (20Karsunky H. Zeng H. Schmidt T. Zevnik B. Kluge R. Schmid K.W. Dührsen U. Möröy T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), Gfi1+/GFP mice were indistinguishable from wt mice and were normal with respect to T- and B-cell development or Gfi1 protein level (not shown). In contrast, homozygous Gfi1GFP/GFP mice showed the typical phenotype of Gfi1-deficient animals that was described recently (17Yücel R. Karsunky H. Klein-Hitpass L. Möröy T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Karsunky H. Zeng H. Schmidt T. Zevnik B. Kluge R. Schmid K.W. Dührsen U. Möröy T. Nat.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), including neutropenia, low thymocyte cellularity, and developmental defects during T-cell differentiation (not shown). GFP fluorescence was readily detectable in virtually all thymocytes of Gfi1+/GFP and at significantly higher levels in thymocytes from Gfi1GFP/GFP mice (Fig. 1, c and d). Next, we compared Gfi1 and GFP transcript levels in FACS-sorted DN, DP CD4+, and CD8+ thymocyte subsets from Gfi1+/gfp mice by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Both the Gfi1 allele and the GFP knock-in allele showed similar but not identical mRNA expression levels (expressed as Δct values) in all four subsets indicating that the transcriptional regulation of the GFP knock-in allele remained largely intact after the homologous recombination at the Gfi1 gene locus (Fig. 1e). Analysis of Gfi1 protein levels in FACS-sorted thymocyte subsets using a previously described α-Gfi1 antibody (9Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Rödel B. Zevnik B. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) revealed that two Gfi1 protein isoforms of 55 and 47 kDa exist that are both absent in Gfi1GFP/GFP knock-out cells (Fig. 1f). Both Gfi1 isoforms are expressed at highest levels in DN thymocytes and decrease in the DP and SP subsets (Fig. 1f). The 47-kDa Gfi1 isoform is expressed at slightly higher levels in CD4 and CD8 single positive thymocytes compared with the DP subset, whereas the 55-kDa isoform is lower in the SP populations than in DP or DN cells (Fig. 1f). GFP protein levels are also highest in DN cells and decrease in the DP subset and in CD4 and CD8 SP cells and, thus, follow the overall expression pattern of both Gfi1 isoforms (Fig. 1f) indicating that green fluorescence in Gfi1+/GFP cells can be a direct measure for Gfi1 expression. Gfi1 Is Up-regulated during CD4/CD8 Lineage Decision and Pre-TCR Selection—To more precisely quantify the expression levels of Gfi1 during all steps of early T-cell development, we used MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) as a readout. Based on the expression of lineage markers (Lin) and the surface markers CD4, CD8, CD25, and CD44, thymocyte subsets of Gfi1+/gfp mice were electronically gated and analyzed for Gfi1 gene expression by measuring green fluorescence. Representative histogram analyses confirmed that Gfi1 is expressed in all stages of T-cell development in the DP and SP subsets as well as in the lineage negative (Lin-) DN subsets (Fig. 2, a and b). The analyses showed further that Gfi1 gene expression increases during DN pre-T-cell development, reaches peak levels in the in β-selected “L” cells of the DN3 subset, and decreases again in DN4 and DP cells (Fig. 2, b and c, right panel). This pattern coincides with our previous assessment of Gfi1 protein levels in purified DN3, “E,” “L,” and DN4 cells (9Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Rödel B. Zevnik B. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, compared with total DPs, Gfi1 gene expression was found to be up-regulated again in the CD4loCD8lo population that undergoes positive/negative selection and where lineage decisions are made (Fig. 2c). Following the differentiation into the CD8 and CD4 direction, we noted that Gfi1 expression is maintained in CD8+CD4lo but is down-regulated in CD4+CD8lo cells (Fig. 2c, left and middle panel). In both CD4 and CD8 SP cells, Gfi1 expression decreases again compared with the CD4loCD8lo population, but CD8+ SP cells maintain a slightly higher Gfi1 expression level than CD4+ SP cells (Fig. 2c, left and middle panel). Gfi1 Expression Is Down-regulated during B-cell Maturation in Bone Marrow—The development of B-cells is well characterized and can be divided into specific stages based on the expression of B220 or CD19 surface markers in combination with c-Kit and CD43 (Fraction A and B/C, pre-pro-B cells, and pro B-cells) or CD25 (Fractions C′ and D, large and small pre-B cells) or IgM/IgD (immature and mature B-cells) (Fig. 3a) (18Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 595-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 19Ceredig R. Rolink T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 2-10Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The analysis of GFP fluorescence in different B-cell populations of Gfi1+/GFP mice showed that the Gfi1 gene is expressed at earlier stages but that the expression largely decreases during further maturation of B-cells (Fig. 3, b and e, left panel) until GFP fluorescence and thus Gfi1 expression becomes undetectable in small, resting mature B-cells of the spleen (Fig. 4a). A more detailed inspection of the early B-cell compartment using expression of the markers CD43 and B220 showed that GFP fluorescence intensity is highest in Fraction A (pre-pro B-cells), decreases in Fractions B/C (pro B-cells), but rises again in Fraction C′ (large pre-B-cells) where the pre-BCR is assembled and presented on the cell surface (Fig. 3, c and e, right panel). Moreover, we separated the pre-B cell subset into small resting (SR) and large cycling (LC) cells according to the expression of CD25 and B220 (2Scheijen B. Jonkers J. Acton D. Berns A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Monroe R.J. Seidl K.J. Gaertner F. Han S. Chen F. Sekiguchi J.A. Wang J. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Kelseo G. Alt F.W.

https://openalex.org/W1998626477,"Group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) has been shown to play a major role in regulating basal phospholipid deacylation reactions in certain cell types. More recently, roles for this enzyme have also been suggested in the destruction of membrane phospholipid during apoptosis and after oxidant injury. Proposed iPLA2 roles have rested heavily on the use of bromoenol lactone as an iPLA2-specific inhibitor, but this compound actually inhibits other enzymes and lipid pathways unrelated to PLA2, which makes it difficult to define the contribution of iPLA2 to specific functions. In previous work, we pioneered the use of antisense technology to decrease cellular iPLA2 activity as an alternative approach to study iPLA2 functions. In the present study, we followed the opposite strategy and prepared U937 cells that exhibited enhanced iPLA activity by stably expressing a plasmid containing iPLA2 cDNA. Compared with control cells, the iPLA2 -overexpressing U937 cells showed elevated responses to hydrogen peroxide with regard to both arachidonic acid mobilization and incorporation of the fatty acid into phospholipids, thus providing additional evidence for the key role that iPLA2 plays in these events. Long-term exposure of the cells to hydrogen peroxide resulted in cell death by apoptosis, and this process was accelerated in the iPLA2-overexpressing cells. Increased phospholipid hydrolysis and fatty acid release also occurred in these cells. Unexpectedly, however, abrogation of U937 cell iPLA2 activity by either methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate or an antisense oligonucleotide did not delay or decrease the extent of apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that, although iPLA2-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis occurs during apoptosis, iPLA2 may actually be dispensable for the apoptotic process to occur. Thus, beyond a mere destructive role, iPLA2 may play other roles during apoptosis.

Thus, beyond a mere destructive role, iPLA2 may play other roles during apoptosis. Phospholipases A2 constitute a diverse group of enzymes whose common feature is to hydrolyze the fatty acid at the sn-2 position of phospholipids. Several mammalian intracellular and extracellular phospholipase A2 (PLA2) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; sPLA, secreted PLA2; cPLA2, cytosolic PLA2; iPLA2, Ca2+ -independent PLA2; AA, arachidonic acid; BEL, bromoenol lactone; lyso-PC, lysophosphatidylcholine; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MAFP, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate. enzymes have been characterized in recent years and classified into 14 group types on the basis of sequence data (1Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 2Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Dennis E.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). According to their biochemical characteristics, the PLA2 enzymes are generally grouped into three major subfamilies, viz. secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) enzymes, cytosolic Ca2+-dependent PLA2 (cPLA2), and cytosolic Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) (1Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 2Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Dennis E.A.

Prostaglandins. 2002; 68 (69): 3-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). sPLA2 enzymes are extracellular low molecular mass enzymes that require millimolar Ca2+ concentrations for activity. cPLA2, specifically the α isoform, is an intracellular enzyme that plays a pivotal role in receptor-coupled arachidonic acid (AA) release and prostaglandin production. Whereas cPLA2α has a striking selectivity for AA-containing phospholipids, sPLA2 enzymes do not exhibit acyl chain specificity. iPLA2 enzymes are Ca2+-independent cytosolic enzymes whose functional role(s) in cells has recently gained interest (7Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Among the iPLA2 enzymes, the better studied is the one classified as Group VIA. This is an 85-kDa enzyme that shows no fatty acid selectivity and is potently and irreversibly inhibited by bromoenol lactone (BEL) (7Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that Group VIA iPLA2 is directly involved in maintaining the homeostatic levels of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) in resting cells (9Balsinde J. Pérez R. Sáez Y. Balboa M.A. Fonteh A.N. Wykle R.L. Arachidonate Remodeling and Inflammation. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2004: 61-72Crossref Google Scholar). Since lyso-PC is the main acceptor of free AA for its incorporation into phospholipid pools (10Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), Group VIA iPLA2 has been implicated in phospholipid fatty acyl chain deacylation/reacylation reactions (i.e. the Lands cycle). In these reactions, a phospholipid containing a saturated fatty acid at the sn-2 position is cleaved by Group VIA iPLA2, and the resulting lysophospholipid acceptor is acylated by CoA-dependent acyltransferases with a polyunsaturated fatty acid such as AA. This proposal, based on the demonstration that inhibition of cellular iPLA2 by BEL or a specific antisense oligonucleotide blocks AA incorporation, was originally described in P388D1 macrophages (11Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and was later confirmed by others in a number of mammalian cells (13Daniele J.J. Fidelio G.D.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 7118-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It seems likely, however, that Group VIA iPLA2 is not the only enzyme involved in maintaining homeostatic lysophospholipid levels (16Balsinde J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and that this is not the only cellular function of Group VIA iPLA2 in cells. Recent evidence has implicated this enzyme in the destruction of membrane phospholipid subsequent to cells entering apoptosis, resulting in the liberation of various free fatty acids to the extracellular medium (17Atsumi G.

Another instance wherein iPLA2-mediated phospholipolysis occurs in a seemingly receptor-uncontrolled manner is during oxidative stress (20Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 276: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, cells from schizophrenic patients have been reported to exhibit a constitutively elevated phospholipid fatty acid turnover, which appears to be mediated by an iPLA2-like activity (22Horrobin D.F. Bennett C.N. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 141-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To further expand our investigations on cellular functions of Group VIA iPLA2 in human U937 cells (9Balsinde J. Pérez R. Sáez Y. Balboa M.A. Fonteh A.N. Wykle R.L.

Utilizing this strategy, we reassessed the role of iPLA2 in oxidant-induced AA release and incorporation into phospholipids and extended our studies to the role of iPLA2 in oxidant-induced apoptosis. Materials—[5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]AA (200 Ci/mmol) and [3H]choline chloride (80 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. BEL and the anti-Group VIA iPLA2 antibody were from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). The pcDNA3.1 vector containing the mouse Group VIA iPLA2 gene was kindly provided by Dr. Suzanne Jackowski (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) (25Chiu C.H. Jackowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture—U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of CO2/O2 (1:19) at a cell density of 0.5–1 × 106 cells/ml in 12-well plastic culture dishes (Costar Corp.). Differentiation was achieved by treating the cells with 35 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h. Production of Transfectants Stably Expressing Group VIA iPLA2— The plasmid containing Group VIA iPLA2 (∼2 μg/106 cells) was transfected by electroporation at 270 V (975 microfarads) using a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad). To select for the transfected cells, they were incubated in medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin. To obtain transfectants stably expressing Group VIA iPLA2, the transfected cells were cloned by limiting dilution in medium containing 300 μg/ml Geneticin. After 2 weeks, wells containing a single colony were chosen for further expansion, and iPLA2 expression was analyzed by immunoblotting and measurement of iPLA2 activity. The clones were always grown in medium containing 300 μg/ml Geneticin. Immunoblot Analyses—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer, and 15 μg of cellular protein from each sample were separated by standard 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Dilution of both primary and secondary antibodies was performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% defatted dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. After a 1-h incubation with primary antibody at 1:1000, blots were washed three times, and a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was added for another hour. Immunoblots were developed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system. iPLA2 Assay—Briefly, aliquots of U937 cell homogenates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm EDTA and 100 μm labeled phospholipid substrate (1-palmitoyl-2-[3H]palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine, specific activity of 60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in a final volume of 150 μl. The phospholipid substrate was used in the form of sonicated vesicles in buffer. The reactions were quenched by adding 3.75 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:2). After lipid extraction, free [3H]palmitic acid was separated by thin-layer chromatography. Measurement of Lyso-PC—Cells labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]choline for 2 days were used. After the incubations, lipids were extracted with ice-cold 1-butanol and separated by thin-layer chromatography with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:40:6:0.6) as a solvent system. Spots corresponding to lyso-PC were scraped into scintillation vials, and the amount of radioactivity was estimated by liquid scintillation counting. Measurement of [3H]AA Release and of [3H]AA Incorporation into Phospholipids—For the AA release experiments, the cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA for 18 h. Under these conditions, equilibrium labeling of AA pools with [3H]AA is reached. After this period, the cells were washed and placed in serum-free medium for 1 h before the addition of the appropriate stimulus in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The supernatants were removed, cleared of cells by centrifugation, and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. [3H]AA release under these equilibrium conditions represents a balance between what is liberated directly from phospholipids minus what is reincorporated back into phospholipids by the action of acyltransferases. [3H]AA incorporation into phospholipids cannot be measured simultaneously with [3H]AA release because the former cannot be distinguished from the endogenous phospholipid-bound [3H]AA that has not been mobilized by PLA2. To circumvent this problem, AA incorporation experiments were conducted in parallel under the same experimental conditions as those employed above for [3H]AA release, but unlabeled cells were used instead, and exogenous [3H]AA was added together with the stimulus. Briefly, the cells were placed in serum-free medium for 1 h before exposure to exogenous [3H]AA (10 μm, 0.5 μCi/ml) in the presence or absence of the indicated stimuli. At the indicated times, supernatants were removed, and the cell monolayers were scraped twice with 0.1% Triton X-100. Total lipids were extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography with n-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1 by volume). Spots corresponding to phospholipid were scraped, and their radioactive content was determined by scintillation counting. Antisense Oligonucleotide Treatments—The iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide utilized in this study has been described in previous studies from our laboratory (12Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J.

The iPLA2 antisense sequence corresponds to nucleotides 59–78 in the murine Group VIA iPLA2 sequence, which is conserved in human Group VIA iPLA2 (26Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J.

The antisense or sense oligonucleotides were mixed with LipofectAMINE, and complexes were allowed to form at room temperature for 10–15 min. The complexes were then added to the cells, and the incubations were allowed to proceed under standard cell culture conditions. The final concentrations of oligonucleotide and LipofectAMINE were 1 μm and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Oligonucleotide treatment and culture conditions were not toxic for the cells as assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay and by quantitating adherent cellular protein. The conditions for using a human cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide were as described by Tommasini and Cantoni (28Tommasini I. Cantoni O. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were 5′-TAC AGT AAA TAT CTA GGA ATG-3′ (antisense) and 5′-CCT ACT GAG GGT ACG GTA CAT-3′ (sense; random sequence of the antisense bases). The oligonucleotides were phosphorothioate-modified (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The U937 cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and seeded at a cell density of 106 cells/ml in serum-free medium for 6 h in the absence or presence of the oligonucleotides (10 μm). A final concentration of 5% fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h and finally used for experiments. Measurement of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was analyzed by labeling with the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection kit (Pharmingen), which recognizes phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a Coulter Epics XL-MCL cytofluorometer. Data Presentation—Assays were carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times with similar results. Unless indicated otherwise, the data presented are from representative experiments. Characterization of U937 Cells Overexpressing Group VIA iPLA2—Transfection of U937 cells with a plasmid containing mouse Group VIA iPLA2 followed by selection of Geneticin-resistant clones resulted in the isolation of a stably transfected clone expressing 3–4-fold increased levels of iPLA2 activity compared with control cells transfected with an empty plasmid (Fig. 1A). The stable transfectants also showed increased levels of an 85-kDa protein that was recognized by the anti-iPLA2 antibody from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc. (Fig. 1A, inset). In addition, the stably transfected cells also exhibited a 2–3-fold increase in the steady-state level of cellular lyso-PC as measured in cells labeled with [3H]choline (Fig. 1B). Importantly, increased iPLA2 expression was not a permanent phenotype of the transfected cells, as it did not persist upon serial passages in culture. Appreciable losses of both iPLA2 activity and immunoreactive protein were detected at ∼20 cell passages. Interestingly, we consistently failed to obtain expression (either transient or stable) of an iPLA2 dominant-negative mutant in which the catalytic Ser465 had been replaced by Ala. These data appear to suggest that large increases or decreases in the intracellular iPLA2 activity content are injurious to U937 cells, highlighting the importance that this class of enzymes may have in the regulation of homeostatic phospholipid metabolism. When exposed to H2O2, U937 macrophage-like cells have been shown to liberate fatty acids, including AA, in a process that appears to depend on iPLA2 (20Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40384-40389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that the iPLA2-overexpressing cells liberated more AA than did control cells when exposed to H2O2. Basal release (i.e. that determined in the absence of H2O2) was also increased in the iPLA2-overexpressing cells. As a control for these experiments, the effect of concanavalin A on AA release from these cells was also investigated. Concanavalin A is known to signal to AA release in U937 cells by directly activating cPLA2, and iPLA2 is not involved (20Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40384-40389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In accordance with these previous findings, iPLA2 overexpression did not result in an increased AA release response of the cells to concanavalin A (data not shown). Thus, iPLA2 overexpression does not impact on cellular functions that do not depend on iPLA2. To further support the lack of involvement of cPLA2 in H2O2-induced AA mobilization, experiments were conducted in which cPLA2 expression was knocked out by antisense technology (Fig. 3). Only partial inhibition of cPLA2 could be achieved (38 ± 5% inhibition as assessed by immunoblotting) (Fig. 3, inset), which was not unexpected, given the high levels of cPLA2 that U937 cells are known to express (29Clark J.D. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7708-7712Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 30Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putnam J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite such a low inhibition, we were still able to detect significant inhibition of the concanavalin A-induced AA release (Fig. 3). Importantly, parallel measurement of the H2O2-induced AA mobilization showed no detectable effect (Fig. 3). These data, along with our previous data showing no inhibition of the H2O2-induced AA release by the cPLA2-specific inhibitor pyrrophenone (20Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40384-40389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), support the lack of a role for cPLA2 in oxidant-induced AA mobilization in U937 cells.Fig. 3Effect of a cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide on stimulus-induced AA release. The cells were treated with a sense oligonucleotide (shaded bars), antisense oligonucleotide (closed bars), or neither (open bars) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Afterward, the cells were exposed to 500 H2O2, 100 μg/ml concanavalin A(Con A), or neither (Control) for 1 h, and AA release was determined.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40384-40389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, previous studies by Sporn et al. (31Sporn P.H. Marshall T.M. Peters-Golden M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) utilizing alveolar macrophages have suggested that a major route by which H2O2 induces AA mobilization in these cells is by impairing fatty acid esterification into phospholipid. Similar results have been reported by Cane et al. (32Cane A. Breton M. Koumanov K. Bereziat G. Colard O. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 274: C1040-C1046Crossref Google Scholar) in vascular smooth muscle cells. Since AA mobilization in response to stimuli represents a balance between what is released from phospholipids by phospholipases minus what is reincorporated back into phospholipids by acyltransferases, we explored whether, in U937 cells, H2O2-induced AA release also involves inhibition of fatty acid incorporation into phospholipids. In the first series of experiments, we assayed H2O2-induced AA release in the presence of thimerosal, a well known inhibitor of fatty acyl-CoA synthetases and hence of fatty acid incorporation into phospholipids (33Goppelt-Strübe M. Körner C.F. Hausmann G. Gemsa D. Resch K. Prostaglandins. 1986; 32: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Kaever V. Goppelt-Strübe M. Resch K. Prostaglandins. 1988; 35: 885-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that thimerosal did not affect AA release on its own, but markedly augmented [3H]AA release in response to H2O2. This clearly suggests that the H2O2 effect on AA release did not involve an inhibitory effect on AA acylation into phospholipids. We directly assayed the effect of H2O2 on AA incorporation into phospholipids in the experiments depicted in Fig. 5. Treating the cells with H2O2 did not inhibit exogenous AA incorporation, but actually enhanced it. Given our previous data showing that H2O2 increases iPLA2 activity in U937 cells (20Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40384-40389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), this unexpected finding correlates well with the proposed role of iPLA2 as a major provider of the lyso-PC acceptors utilized in the initial incorporation of AA into cellular phospholipids. Thus, the simplest explanation for the enhancing effect of H2O2 reported in Fig. 5 is that H2O2, by increasing iPLA2 activity, acts to elevate the intracellular pool of lyso-PC and that this increases AA incorporation. Further proof for the above view was obtained when AA incorporation was studied in the iPLA2 stable transfectants, which, as indicated above, presented higher amounts of lyso-PC to serve as the acyl acceptors. The iPLA2-overexpressing cells incorporated more exogenous AA into phospholipids than did control cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 6). Moreover, when the AA incorporation experiments were conducted in the presence of H2O2, additional increases were observed again in both the untransfected and the iPLA2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6). All these increases were significantly blunted by BEL (∼40% inhibition), confirming the involvement of iPLA2 in the response (Fig. 7). It should be noted, however, that the fact that BEL did not completely blunt AA incorporation indicates that there are other pathways in addition to iPLA2 that may significantly contribute to overall AA incorporation into cellular phospholipids (16Balsinde J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pyrrophenone, a cPLA2-specific inhibitor, failed to exert any significant effect on the response (data not shown). Collectively, the findings in Figs. 5, 6, 7 do support an important role for iPLA2 in AA incorporation into U937 cell phospholipids.Fig. 7Effect of BEL on the incorporation of AA into phospholipids in iPLA2-overexpressing and control (pcDNA3.1) cells. [3H]AA incorporation was measured at 1 h in cells treated (hatched bars) or not (open bars) with 25 μm BEL in the absence (control (Ctrl)) or presence of 500 μm H2O2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Role of iPLA2 in H2O2-induced Apoptosis—H2O2 is known to induce apoptosis in a number of cells (35Wagner B.A. Britigan B.E.

We have previously shown that activation of polyamine catabolism by conditional overexpression of SSAT has antiproliferative consequences in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells. Growth inhibition was causally linked to high metabolic flux arising from a compensatory increase in polyamine biosynthesis. Here we examined the in vivo consequences of SSAT overexpression in a mouse model genetically predisposed to develop prostate cancer. TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate) female C57BL/6 mice carrying the SV40 early genes (T/t antigens) under an androgen-driven probasin promoter were cross-bred with male C57BL/6 transgenic mice that systemically overexpress SSAT. At 30 weeks of age, the average genitourinary tract weights of TRAMP mice were ∼4 times greater than those of TRAMP/SSAT bigenic mice, and by 36 weeks, they were ∼12 times greater indicating sustained suppression of tumor outgrowth. Tumor progression was also affected as indicated by a reduction in the prostate histopathological scores. By immunohistochemistry, SV40 large T antigen expression in the prostate epithelium was the same in TRAMP and TRAMP/SSAT mice. Consistent with the 18-fold increase in SSAT activity in the TRAMP/SSAT bigenic mice, prostatic N1-acetylspermidine and putrescine pools were remarkably increased relative to TRAMP mice, while spermidine and spermine pools were minimally decreased due to a compensatory 5-7-fold increase in biosynthetic enzymes activities. The latter led to heightened metabolic flux through the polyamine pathway and an associated ∼70% reduction in the SSAT cofactor acetyl-CoA and a ∼40% reduction in the polyamine aminopropyl donor S-adenosylmethionine in TRAMP/SSAT compared with TRAMP prostatic tissue. In addition to elucidating the antiproliferative and metabolic consequences of SSAT overexpression in a prostate cancer model, these findings provide genetic support for the discovery and development of specific small molecule inducers of SSAT as a novel therapeutic strategy targeting prostate cancer.

Although prostate cancer can be clinically managed in its early phases, the inability to control the more aggressive late stage disease has prompted the search for novel therapies. We became interested in the possibility that strategies targeting polyamine homeostasis may be effective against prostate cancer. The prostate has the highest level of polyamine biosynthesis of any tissue, and it is the only tissue in which polyamines are purposely synthesized for export. More particularly, massive amounts of polyamines are excreted by the prostate into semen. Thus, we reasoned that polyamine homeostasis may be altered in the prostate relative to other tissues and that tumors derived from this gland may exhibit atypical regulatory responses to polyamine analogues and inhibitors (1Mi Z. Kramer D.L. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Bernacki R. Porter C.W. Prostate. 1998; 34: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An additional rationale for targeting polyamines in prostate cancer derives from a recent meta-analysis of four independent microarray data sets comparing gene expression profiles of benign and malignant patient prostate samples showing that polyamine metabolism was the most systematically affected of all biochemical and signaling pathways (2Rhodes D.R. Barrette T.R. Rubin M.A. Ghosh D. Chinnaiyan A.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4427-4433PubMed Google Scholar). Genes that supported polyamine biosynthesis were up-regulated, while those that detracted from biosynthesis were down-regulated. The findings agree with earlier clinical studies showing a significant increase in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) 1The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; AcSpd, N1-acetylspermidine; DFMO, α-difluoromethylornithine; GU, genitourinary; HPCE, high performance capillary electrophoresis; MR, magnetic resonance; Put, putrescine; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; Spd, spermidine; Spm, spermine; SSAT, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase; Tag, SV40 large T antigen; TRAMP, transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AcSpm, acetylspermine. and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) decarboxylase transcripts in human prostatic cancer relative to benign hyperplasia (3Bettuzzi S.

Polyamines have been targeted in anticancer strategies for some time (4Thomas T. Thomas T.J. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2003; 7: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Various antagonists such as the ODC inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), AdoMet decarboxylase inhibitor (SAM486), and the polyamine analogue N1,N11-diethylnorspermine have undergone clinical testing as therapeutic and/or preventive agents (5Seiler N. Curr. Drug Targets. 2003; 4: 565-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Seiler N. Curr. Drug Targets. 2003; 4: 537-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recognizing the unique physiology of the prostate gland, Heston and collaborators (7Heston W.D. Watanabe K.A. Pankiewicz K.W. Covey D.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1849-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8Heston W.D. Cancer Surv. 1991; 11: 217-238PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed that polyamine inhibitors may be particularly effective against prostate cancer. In support of this concept, Gupta et al. (9Gupta S. Ahmad N. Marengo S.R. MacLennan G.T. Greenberg N.M. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5125-5133PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that DFMO is effective in depleting polyamine pools and in preventing development of prostate cancer in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model (10Greenberg N.M. DeMayo F. Finegold M.J. Medina D. Tilley W.D. Aspinall J.O. Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Matusik R.J. Rosen J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3439-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Targeting polyamines has traditionally involved interference with or down-regulation of polyamine biosynthesis with small molecule inhibitors or analogues, respectively. As an alternative to blocking biosynthesis, we propose that activation of polyamine catabolism by inducing the rate-limiting enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetylspermine transferase (SSAT) may offer distinct advantages. The approach derives from our studies of the polyamine analogue N1,N11-diethylnorspermine that, in addition to down-regulating ODC and AdoMet decarboxylase, very potently up-regulates SSAT in tumor cells and tissues (11Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Casero Jr., R.A. Ervin S.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Bergeron R.J.

Porter C.W. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1083-1089PubMed Google Scholar). The latter was shown to occur to a greater degree in human tumor xenografts than in normal host tissues (15Porter C.W. Bernacki R.J. Miller J. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 581-586PubMed Google Scholar). Correlations between SSAT induction and growth inhibition have been repeatedly suggested by early work in a variety of tumor types (14Shappell N.W. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1083-1089PubMed Google Scholar, 16Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R.

Recently that relationship was more precisely defined by the finding that SSAT-targeted small interfering RNA minimizes analogue-mediated enzyme induction and at the same time prevents polyamine pool depletion and apoptosis (18Chen Y. Kramer D.L. Li F. Porter C.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4964-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Chen Y. Kramer D.L. Jell J. Vujcic S. Porter C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that conditional overexpression of SSAT in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells leads to polyamine pool depletion and growth inhibition (20Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Janne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38319-38328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As a prelude to the present study, we showed that conditional enzyme overexpression in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells causes growth inhibition that differed from that seen in MCF-7 cells in that it was not accompanied by polyamine pool depletion (21Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S. Diegelman P. Kisiel N. Powell C.T. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27050-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Instead cells averted the latter by increasing polyamine biosynthesis at the levels of ODC and AdoMet decarboxylase activities causing heightened metabolic flux through the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways. In a critical experiment, it was shown that interruption of flux by blocking ODC activity prevented growth inhibition (21Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S. Diegelman P. Kisiel N. Powell C.T. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27050-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Additional studies concluded that growth inhibition deriving from overexpression of SSAT was probably attributable to overproduction of pathway products such as acetylated polyamines or to depletion of polyamine precursor metabolites such as AdoMet and/or the SSAT cofactor acetyl-CoA (21Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S. Diegelman P. Kisiel N. Powell C.T. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27050-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Whatever the downstream mechanism, these in vitro data suggest that activation of polyamine catabolism by selective induction of SSAT may constitute an effective antitumor strategy against prostate cancer. The goal of the present study was to further validate the above concept by providing critical in vivo evidence based on a genetic approach. For this purpose, we utilized the TRAMP model that is genetically engineered to develop prostate cancer (10Greenberg N.M. DeMayo F. Finegold M.J. Medina D. Tilley W.D. Aspinall J.O. Cunha G.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) resulted in a profound suppression of prostate tumor outgrowth that may be related to consequences emanating from depletion of acetyl-CoA pools. Materials—The polyamines putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd), spermine (Spm), and acetylated polyamine N1-acetylspermidine (Ac-Spd) were purchased from Sigma. Acetyl-CoA was also purchased from Sigma and solubilized as described by Liu et al. (25Liu G. Chen J. Che P. Ma Y. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

Mouse tail DNA was isolated using the DNeasy® tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Genotyping of TRAMP animals was performed by PCR according to the Jackson Laboratory protocol. We previously generated mice that systemically overexpressed SSAT under its endogenous murine gene promoter (24Pietila M. Alhonen L. Halmekyto M. Kanter P. Janne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These SSAT transgenic mice, in the CD2F1 genetic background (24Pietila M. Alhonen L. Halmekyto M.

The SSAT transgenic mice are characterized by pronounced hair loss by 3-4 weeks of age (24Pietila M. Alhonen L. Halmekyto M. Kanter P. Janne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), making genotyping unnecessary. Since female SSAT transgenic mice are infertile and male mice have normal reproductive capabilities, the latter were cross-bred with female TRAMP mice to generate the bigenic mice used in this study. Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging—Longitudinal analysis of prostate cancer progression in TRAMP mice using MR imaging has been reported by Hsu et al. (26Hsu C.X. Ross B.D. Chrisp C.E. Derrow S.Z. Charles L.G. Pienta K.J. Greenberg N.M. Zeng Z. Sanda M.G. J. Urol. 1998; 160: 1500-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More specifically, it was used to assess tumor volume and to track tumor development in TRAMP and TRAMP/SSAT mice. High resolution MR imaging scans were performed using a General Electric CSI 4.7T/33-cm horizontal bore magnet (GE NMR Instruments, Fremont, CA) with upgraded radio frequency and computer systems. MR imaging data were acquired using a custom designed 35-mm radio frequency transceiver coil and a G060 removable gradient coil insert generating a maximum field strength of 950 milliteslas/m. Transaxial, T1-weighted images were acquired through the lower abdomen with a standard spin echo MR imaging sequence. Images were comprised of 20 × 1-mm thick slices with a 3.2× 3.2-cm field of view acquired with a 192 × 192 matrix to provide contiguous image data of the prostate tumor. Acquisition parameters consisted of an echo time/repetition time = 10/724 ms and 4 number of excitations. Pathology—Mouse genitourinary (GU) tracts consisting of bladder, urethra, seminal vesicles, ampullary gland, and the prostate were excised and weighed. The correlation of GU weight as a function of cancer progression in the TRAMP mouse is well documented by Kaplan-Lefko et al. (27Kaplan-Lefko P.J. Chen T.M. Ittmann M.M. Barrios R.J. Ayala G.E. Huss W.J. Maddison L.A. Foster B.A. Greenberg N.M. Prostate. 2003; 55: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Once GU tracts were grossly examined and documented by fixed angle photography, the dorsal, lateral, ventral, and anterior lobes of the prostate as well as the seminal vesicles were microdissected and placed into multichamber cassettes for fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C after which they were paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). H&E slides were reviewed by two experienced morphologists without knowledge of the genotype or age of the mice. Each prostatic lobe (dorsal, lateral, ventral, and anterior) was scored according to the grading system established by Gingrich et al. (28Gingrich J.R. Barrios R.J. Foster B.A. Greenberg N.M. Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. 1999; 2: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The histological scores were then averaged and expressed as mean ± S.E. Immunohistochemistry—Slides containing 5-μm sections were quenched with aqueous 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min and rinsed with PBS/T (500 μl/liter Tween 20) to remove endogenous peroxidases. Antigen retrieval involved continuous microwaving of the slides in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 min. Cooled slides were washed for 5 min in PBS/T at room temperature and blocked with 0.03% casein in PBS/T for 30 min prior to the addition of primary antibodies. For anti-SV40 large T antigen staining, monoclonal anti-SV40 large T antigen antibody (catalog number 554149, BD Pharmingen) was used at a 1:400 dilution in a humidity chamber. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, slides were washed with PBS/T and incubated for 30 min with secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins from the LSAB+ kit (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) diluted according to the manufacturer's protocol. The slides were then washed with PBS/T and complexed with streptavidin (LSAB+ kit, DAKO, prediluted) for 30 min. Immunoreactive anti-SV40 large T antigen was detected by the application of the substrate 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAKO) for 5 min. All sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Analytical Methods—Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, crushed into a fine powder in a mortar or a Bio-Pulverizer (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK), and then sonicated on ice in Tris/EDTA buffer for polyamine enzyme activities and pool analysis. SSAT activity was assayed as described previously (29Bernacki R.J. Oberman E.J. Seweryniak K.E. Atwood A. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 847-857PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as pmol of N1-[14C]acetylspermidine generated/min/mg of protein. Decarboxylase activities were determined by a CO2 trap assay and expressed as pmol of CO2 released/h/mg of protein (30Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Polyamines and the acetylated derivatives of Spd and Spm were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography following methods reported by Kramer et al. (30Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, frozen tissues were crushed into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle after which total RNA was extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation (32Ross J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). RNA was loaded onto a gel at 30 μg/lane and subjected to Northern blot analysis following procedures described by Fogel-Petrovic et al. (33Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA Determinations—High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) separation and quantitation of acetyl-CoA in tissue samples as recently described (21Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S.

Chem. 2003; 75: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Tissues extracts were then analyzed on a Beckman P/ACE MDQ capillary electrophoresis system (Fullerton, CA) equipped with a photodiode array detector and an uncoated fused silica capillary electrophoresis column of 75-μm inner diameter and 60 cm in length with 50 cm from inlet to the detection window (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ). Electrophoretic conditions were according to Liu et al. (25Liu G. Chen J. Che P. Ma Y. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described previously (21Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S. Diegelman P. Kisiel N. Powell C.T. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27050-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data were collected and processed by Beckman P/ACE 32 Karat software version 4.0. Acetyl-CoA levels were expressed as nmol/g of tissue. Statistics—Statistical significance (p value) was determined by Student's t test or analysis of variance with Fisher's protected least significant difference test at a 95% confidence level using a StatView computer program (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The goal of this study was to provide in vivo genetic validation for the concept that activating polyamine catabolism at the level of SSAT will give rise to an antitumor response due to homeostatic perturbations in polyamine metabolism. The effort was catalyzed by our recent reports showing that conditional overexpression of SSAT inhibits in vitro growth of both MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (20Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Janne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38319-38328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells (21Kee K.

Consistent with these findings, we now demonstrate that overexpression of SSAT markedly suppresses tumor outgrowth of early and advanced prostatic cancer in TRAMP mice. As will be discussed, this may be due to unusual sensitivity of prostate-derived tumors to polyamine perturbations and/or to novel metabolic disturbances emanating from compensatory responses to activated polyamine catabolism. SSAT-overexpressing transgenic male mice were cross-bred with female TRAMP mice to yield four cohorts of offspring: wild type, SSAT transgenic mice, and TRAMP and TRAMP/SSAT bigenics 15 weeks of age. Prostate and liver tissues were excised from wild-type, SSAT, TRAMP, and TRAMP/SSAT mice to confirm SSAT mRNA expression and enzyme activity. As shown in Fig. 1, prostate gland SSAT mRNA levels were elevated 32- and 35-fold in both SSAT and TRAMP/SSAT cohorts, respectively, relative to wild-type mice. Consistent with SSAT gene overexpression prostatic enzyme activity in both SSAT and TRAMP/SSAT mice was elevated by ∼18-fold. SSAT mRNA in liver of SSAT and TRAMP/SSAT mice was increased 20- and 30-fold over wild-type mice, but unlike the prostate, enzyme activities were only increased 3- and 2-fold, presumably due to tissue-specific differences in translational control (24Pietila M. Alhonen L. Halmekyto M. Kanter P. Janne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The data confirm that overexpression of SSAT occurs in the prostate of transgene-bearing mice. Longitudinal assessment of the prostate by MR imaging was used to monitor tumor appearance and development in representative TRAMP animals. GU tumors were first apparent at ∼20 weeks of age in TRAMP animals. By 30 weeks, all TRAMP mice had visible prostate tumors that, with time, infiltrated the seminal vesicles as is typical in the pure C57BL/6 genetic background (10Greenberg N.M. DeMayo F.

As observed using MR imaging and confirmed at necropsy, some TRAMP mice exhibited predominantly prostatic tumors, while the majority showed significant prostate tumors with seminal vesicle involvement. Both pathologies were reduced in the TRAMP/SSAT mice. On the basis of tumor size in TRAMP mice, the experimental end point was set at week 30. The suppressive effect of SSAT overexpression on tumor outgrowth is apparent in comparisons of dissected GU tracts shown in Fig. 2A. Gross examination of both wild-type and SSAT animals revealed GU tracts that were generally uniform in size and shape. As graphed in Fig. 2B, GU tracts of the SSAT mice were significantly smaller (178 ± 30 mg) than those of the wild-type mice (504 ± 11 mg) despite close similarities in body weight (∼29.7 ± 0.6 versus 28.5 ± 0.5 g, respectively). All of the TRAMP mice displayed visible evidence of prostatic tumors with variable involvement of the seminal vesicles. On the basis of weight, TRAMP GU tracts (1,435 ± 181 mg) were, on average, 4 times larger than those of TRAMP/SSAT mice (356 ± 62 mg). Taken together, the data indicate that SSAT overexpression effectively suppresses tumor outgrowth in the TRAMP model. Since by itself, the 30-week data may reflect a delay in tumor development as opposed to a sustained antitumor effect, we examined tumor size at a later time point. For this, 36 weeks was the longest time possible without encountering tumor excess. Relative to the 30-week data, the average GU tract weight in the TRAMP mice became 200% larger, while that in the TRAMP/SSAT mice at 36 weeks remained statistically unchanged. Thus, suppression of tumor outgrowth became even more exaggerated during the 30-36-week period. Although these findings suggest that the survival time of the TRAMP/SSAT mice would be significantly extended beyond that of the TRAMP mice, such studies were precluded by the strong tendency of the older bigenics to develop skin pathologies. Histopathological analysis from littermates of the TRAMP and SSAT transgenic crosses at 30 weeks demonstrated that the prostate tumors of TRAMP mice were heterogeneous, ranging from high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (grade 3) to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (grade 6), while tumors from TRAMP/SSAT mice were more homogeneous with a moderate range of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions (grades 2 and 3) and only rare evidence of well differentiated adenocarcinoma (grade 4) (Fig. 3A). Consistent with previous reports (28Gingrich J.R. Barrios R.J. Foster B.A. Greenberg N.M. Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. 1999; 2: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), disease in the TRAMP mouse was apparent in the dorsal, lateral, and ventral lobes with substantial seminal vesicle involvement, and it tended to be heterogeneous among mice. When all prostate lobes were averaged (Table I), the mean TRAMP/SSAT mouse grade (4.2) was significantly lower than that of the TRAMP mice (5.0) suggesting interference with disease progression. A similar trend was also seen at 36 weeks. Thus, while the major effect of SSAT overexpression is most obviously manifested as suppression of tumor outgrowth, there is also a delay in tumor progression. Because prostatic disease in the C57BL/6 background infiltrated the seminal vesicles, we derived an index to quantify overall GU disease. Thus, the average histological grades of the four lobes were averaged and then multiplied by the mean GU tract weight to derive a GU disease index for each cohort o"
https://openalex.org/W2143843964,"One well documented family of enzymes responsible for the proteolytic processes that occur in the extracellular matrix is the soluble and membrane-associated matrix metalloproteinases. Here we present the first theoretical model of the biochemical network describing the proteolysis of collagen I by matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2) and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinases (MT1-MMP) in the presence of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2) in a bulk, cell-free, well stirred environment. The model can serve as a tool for describing quantitatively the activation of the MMP2 proenzyme (pro-MMP2), the ectodomain shedding of MT1-MMP, and the collagenolysis arising from both of the enzymes. We show that pro-MMP2 activation, a process that involves a trimer formation of the proenzyme with TIMP2 and MT1-MMP, is suppressed at high inhibitor levels and paradoxically attains maximum only at intermediate TIMP2 concentrations. We also calculate the conditions for which pro-MMP2 activation is maximal. Furthermore we demonstrate that the ectodomain shedding of MT1-MMP can serve as a mechanism controlling the MT1-MMP availability and therefore the pro-MMP2 activation. Finally the proteolytic synergism of MMP2 and MT1-MMP is introduced and described quantitatively. The model provides us a tool to determine the conditions under which the synergism is optimized.

A major mode of angiogenesis is capillary sprouting that involves the formation and stabilization of a sprouting bud built from a pool of proliferating endothelial cells near the basal lamina. The rate-determining step for this process is the disengagement of the natural barriers that restrict the unconfined migration of the proliferating cells into the neovascularized tissue (1Somerville R.P. Oblander S.A. Apte S.S. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 216.1-216.11Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 2Haas T.L. Can. J. Appl.

These barriers are comprised of the structural elements of the basement membrane and the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1, membrane type 1; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; TM, transmembrane.1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1, membrane type 1; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; TM, transmembrane. including the different types of collagens, either fibrillar (collagens I and II) or network-forming (collagen IV), elastic fibers, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans as well as different glycoproteins, the biochemical “glue” of all of these components. A prerequisite for the migration of endothelial cells through the ECM is the initiation, at the cell surface, of a biochemical pathway responsible for the proteolytic degradation of all these structural barriers (4Seiki M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Growth factor stimulation leads to the secretion of ECM-digesting enzymes, proteases, from endothelial cells, stromal cells, or both (3Moses M.A. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and in the case of tumor angiogenesis, from the tumor cells (5Hornebeck W. Emonard H. Monboisse J.C. Bellon G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The production of proteases by these cells can lead to profound changes in the morphology of the surrounding ECM that will finally attenuate the restrictive structural barriers and allow the proliferating population of endothelial cells to migrate into the avascular tissue. Furthermore it can lead to the release of growth factors from the ECM, specifically of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), for which theoretical models are emerging (6Filion R.J. Popel A.S. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2004; 32: 645-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Mac Gabhann F. Popel A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H153-H164Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One well studied class of these enzymes is the soluble and membrane-associated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (1Somerville R.P. Oblander S.A. Apte S.S. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 216.1-216.11Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 8Fang J. Shing Y. Wiederschain D. Yan L. Butterfield C. Jackson G. Harper J. Tamvakopoulos G. Moses M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Physiol. 2000; 279: H1540-H1547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During angiogenesis and in response to various angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, MMPs are up-regulated at the level of expression as well as relocalized at the fronts of the migrating cells where they initiate the proteolytic pathway. Although these proteins have been thoroughly examined experimentally, there is yet no integrative, quantitative description of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the extracellular matrix degradation. Here we examine theoretically the biochemical network responsible for the degradation of collagen I by the membrane type metalloproteinase MT1-MMP, which under physiologic conditions resides at the cell surface, and by matrix metalloproteinase MMP2 in the presence of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP2. The reactions of the biochemical network are modeled in bulk, “well stirred” solution in a cell-free system. This description follows a variety of experimental approaches where free MMP2s, the MT1-MMPs bound on membrane fragments, or the proteins devoid of their transmembrane domain that restricts them on the cell surface (ΔTM-MT1-MMP) interact with their substrates or inhibitors in bulk conditions. Under physiologic conditions MMP2 is secreted mainly by endothelial cells in its inactive form, or zymogen, pro-MMP2, and it has been established that its activation occurs mostly via a mechanism involving complex formation that consists of the zymogen, MT1-MMP, and TIMP2 in 1:1:1 stoichiometry. The proposed model can serve as a tool for quantifying the activation of the MMP2 zymogen as a function of the MT1-MMP and TIMP2 concentrations. In agreement with a previously proposed experiment-based hypothesis regarding the effects of TIMP2 on the pro-MMP2 activation, we demonstrate that low TIMP2 concentration is not able to initiate the activation of pro-MMP2, while high concentrations inhibit the zymogen processing. We also predict concentration ratios where the activation occurs at higher reaction rates. The ectodomain shedding of the membrane-bound MT1-MMP, a process where the catalytic part of MT1-MMP (MT1cat) is shed from the rest of the protein creating an 18-kDa fragment, is also incorporated in our description. We show that the ectodomain shedding regulates the “functional” MT1-MMP population dynamics thus imposing an extra regulatory mechanism for the pro-MMP2 activation. Once activated, MMP2 can bind to and be inhibited by TIMP2. In our model we test the hypothesis that MMP2 can form either a single or two-isoform (an intermediate and a final) complex with TIMP2, and the dynamics of the two species are predicted. In the latter case, we show that the intermediate isoform is a low concentration, extremely transient species that makes it hard to be experimentally observed and suggest possible conditions where the specific molecule can be detected. The enzyme that is not inhibited by TIMP2 can bind and degrade collagen. Our model delineates this phenomenon by considering the effect of the initial ratios of the protease/inhibitor concentrations on the progress of the collagenolytic activity of the enzyme. We show that the two MMP2·TIMP2 isoform approach describes a stronger inhibitory effect, inducing almost a biphasic (all or none) response on the MMP2 enzymatic potential depending on the enzyme/inhibitor initial concentrations ratios. Finally we merge all the aforementioned modules to gain quantitative insight into the MMP2/MT1-MMP synergism on collagen I degradation. This is the first biochemical reaction kinetic model developed to study the proteolytic properties of the MMP protein family, and it is the first step toward a more detailed description that will account for the multiple enzymes and substrates of the proteolytic processes in the extracellular matrix. Model Computations—The system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations describing the time evolution of the various species concentrations, as shown schematically in Fig. 1, briefly presented in the on-line supplement and discussed below, was numerically solved using Mathworks Matlab® software. A solver for stiff problems, ode23s, was chosen for most of the cases. All the calculations were performed in double precision, and for the time integration either a subsecond time step was chosen or the solver used adjustable time steps in accordance with a specified accuracy (10-13-10-14 μm). The model was solved for varying initial concentrations usually similar to those used in many of the reported in vitro experiments. The rate constants for each of the reactions included in the biochemical network are summarized in Table I and are discussed below under “Results and Discussion.”Table IExperimentally derived values of parameters for the collage type I, MMP2, MT1-MMP, TIMP2 modelConstantReported valueReported experimental temperatureRef.°CkonM2,T25.9 × 106 M−1 S−12521koffM2,T26.3 S−12521kisoM2,T233 S−12521k−isoM2,T22 × 10−8 S−12521KIM2,T27.2 × 10−9 M2520konM2,C12.6 × 103 M−1 S−12228aValues for pro-MMP2.koffM2,C12.1 × 10−3 S−12228aValues for pro-MMP2.kcatM2,C14.5 × 10−3 S−12522KmM2,C18.5 × 10−6 M2522konMT1cat,T23.54 × 106 M−1 S−13717b21-kDa species.konΔMT1,T22.98 × 106 M−1 S−12212konMT1cat,T24.18 × 106 M−1 S−12212KIMT1,T21.39 × 10−9 M2515KIMT1,T24.9 × 10−9 M413KIMT1,T22.54 × 10−9 M414konMT1·T2,M2pro0.14 × 106 M−1 S−12520koffMT1·T2,M2pro4.7 × 10−3 S−12520KDMT1·T2,M2pro0.56 × 10−9 M414konMT1·T2·M2pro,MT13 × 103 M−1 S−12525cFitted value.koffMT1·T2·M2pro,MT10.9 × 10−3 S−12525cFitted value.kactM22 × 10−2 S−12525cFitted value.kact,effMMP22.8 × 103 M−1 S−12525cFitted value.kshed,effMT1cat2.8 × 103 M−1 S−125AssumedKmΔMT1,C12.9 × 10−6 M2718kcatΔMT1,C11.97 × 10−3 S−12718a Values for pro-MMP2.b 21-kDa species.c Fitted value. Open table in a new tab Model Formulation—Based on the extensive analysis of published experimental data, we represent the biochemical network of collagen I proteolysis induced by the membrane type proteinase MT1-MMP and the free diffusible species MMP2. The latter is activated by forming complexes with MT1-MMP and the inhibitor TIMP2. The reaction scheme is summarized in Fig. 1. Under physiologic conditions, the MT1-MMP is a key enzyme for the ECM invasive capacity of the cells (10Seiki M. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 11Quaranta V.

Its activation occurs mostly intracellularly, and it can degrade collagen or it can bind to TIMP2, which is either secreted by the same or by neighboring cells, forming a dimer, MT1-MMP·TIMP2.

The kinetics of the inhibitory association for MT1-MMP is well studied, and the rate constants have been reported (12Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S. Crabbe T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) have shown that the active MT1-MMP is autocatalytically processed by a second order reaction on the cell surface to an inactive membrane-tethered ∼44-kDa species lacking the entire catalytic domain. Although Toth et al. (17Toth M. Hernandez-Barrantes S. Osenkowski P. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Shimura Y. Meroueh O. Kotra L.P. Galvez B.G. Arroyo A.G. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol.

Once the MMP2 zymogen is activated by MT1-MMP at the cell surface, it can diffuse into the collagen matrix and initiate proteolytic events leading to the fibril degradation (Fig. 1). It can also be inhibited after binding to the free diffusing TIMP2. In our TIMP2 and MMP2 binding analysis, we adopt and compare two approaches: a classic single step inhibitory mechanism suggested by Olson et al. (20Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and a scheme introduced by Murphy and co-workers (21Hutton M. Willenbrock F. Brocklehurst K. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) where the two species form two distinct isoforms, MMP2·TIMP2 and MMP2·TIMP2*. The MMP2-induced collagenolytic process is considered a simple catalytic reaction where the enzyme initially forms a dimer with collagen I, MMP2·collagen I, and it is this dimer that upon dissociation yields the denatured product. In our analysis we adopt the kinetics from several previous investigations for collagen I matrices (21Hutton M. Willenbrock F. Brocklehurst K. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5872-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP2 Activation—The present theoretical model provides us a quantitative tool for investigating the effects of the initial pro-MMP2, TIMP2, and MT1-MMP concentrations on the proenzyme activation kinetics. The kinetics will depend on the concentrations of the two molecules involved in the activation mechanism: the free MT1-MMP and the trimer MT1-MMP·TIMP2·pro-MMP2 (Fig. 1). Thus a detailed description of the dynamics of the two species can provide insight into the activation kinetics. By considering MT1-MMPs (in their ΔTM-MT1-MMP form) as molecules in bulk solution with TIMP2 and pro-MMP2 and by varying the initial conditions of the proenzyme, the inhibitor TIMP2, and the activating enzyme MT1-MMP, we can perform numerical experiments studying the formation of the different complexes, such as the MT1-MMP·TIMP2 or the MT1-MMP·TIMP2·pro-MMP2, as well as calculate the availability of free MT1-MMP (Fig. 2, A and B). For the calculations an initial concentration of 50 nm pro-MMP2 is used, while the TIMP2 varies from 0 to 200 nm, and MT1-MMP varies from 0 to 100 nm. Looking at the particular set of data and taking into consideration the dependence of the activation mechanism on the concentration of the free MT1-MMP (Fig. 2A) and the triple complex MT1-MMP·TIMP2·pro-MMP2 (Fig. 2B), one can test the existence of pairs of initial MT1-MMP and TIMP2 concentrations that may yield proenzyme activation, expressed quantitatively as the amount of initial pro-MMP2 that is transformed into the active protease. At low inhibitor concentrations (e.g. for 4 nm TIMP2) the free MT1-MMPs are predominant. At these conditions, however, the formed MT1-MMP·TIMP2·pro-MMP2 trimer levels are minimal as there is no TIMP2 available for the triple complex formation. At high inhibitor concentrations (e.g. 200 nm TIMP2) the amount of the free MT1-MMP drops to almost zero levels. The entire amount of the enzyme is used up either by forming dimers with the inhibitor or trimers with TIMP2 and pro-MMP2. It is the latter complexes that are waiting to initiate the activation of the proenzyme, a process that for these conditions is improbable because there is no free “activator.” Thus pro-MMP2 activation is likely to initiate at the intermediate inhibitor levels. By taking into consideration the actual kinetics of the proenzyme activation and not only the dynamics of isoform formation, we can test the existence of such conditions that can yield pro-MMP2 activation. The kinetics of the proenzyme formation can be investigated by incorporating an activation step in the studied mechanism. As already mentioned, the physiologic activation of the pro-MMP2 occurs via an already activated protease, usually an MT1-MMP, which initiates cleavage of its propeptide domain. This process is usually completed through an intramolecular, autocatalytic maturation of the proenzyme into a fully functional moiety (23Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The activation step is modeled as an enzymatic reaction where the trimer MT1-MMP·TIMP2·pro-MMP2, which can be considered as a classic “substrate,” forms a complex with the activating enzyme MT1-MMP. Although, so far, no rate constants for this process have been reported, one can utilize the results determining the zymogen activation by measuring its ability to cleave fluorescently labeled substrates under conditions where its activation occurs either by cleaved MT1-MMPs (ΔTM-MT1-MMPs) or by cell-derived MT1-MMPs containing membranes in bulk solution with TIMP2 and pro-MMP2 (12Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S. Crabbe T. Clements J. d'Ortho M.P. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42018-42026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and thus calculate a set of kinetic constants. In the bulk pro-MMP2 activation experiments, for example those reported by English et al. (25English W.R. Holtz B. Vogt G. Knauper V. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42018-42026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the direct activation of the proenzyme by free ΔTMMT1-MMP is measured. Assuming activation of 0.9 μm pro-MMP2 by 0.09 μm soluble protease and using rate constants kMT1·TIMP2,pro−MMP2on=3×10−3 μm-1 s-1, kMT1·TIMP2,pro−MMP2off=0.9×10−3 s-1, and kMMP2act=2×10−2 s-1, we can reproduce the reported experimental results (Fig. 2C). In the kinetic mechanism, no separate MMP2 autolytic step is considered, and the maturation dynamics of the enzyme is incorporated in the “activation step.” Interestingly the calculated dissociation rate, kMT1·TIMP2,pro−MMP2off=0.9×10−3 10−3 s-1, is low, implying that once pro-MMP2 encounters the TIMP2-free MT1-MMP it will get activated; a non-activatory dissociation of this complex is extremely slow/nearly absent. Also by considering a steady state for the pro-MMP2·MT1-MMP intermediate complex and by using kMMP2act,eff=2.8×10−3 μm-1 s-1 the experimental results are also reproduced especially at time scales greater than 1 h. Considering that the pro-MMP2 has already formed a trimer with MT1-MMP and TIMP2 and adopting the calculated kinetics for free pro-MMP2 activation as shown in the reaction scheme describing the formation of the various isoforms (Fig. 1), we can calculate the amount of the active enzyme formed. The assumption that the free and a trimer-associated pro-MMP2 have similar activation kinetics is valid in the current context. The trimer-associated proenzyme resides at the outer part of the complex, thus any steric interruptions with the other complex-participating species are unlikely; in addition, in a well stirred environment of the experiments under consideration the diffusion limitations are negligible. The pro-MMP2 activation calculations are performed for the ranges of initial concentrations of MT1-MMP and TIMP2 used above, and the activation profiles are shown in Fig. 2D. The model predicts pro-MMP2 activation maxima for the set of initial concentrations of MT1-MMP and TIMP2. This maximum activation occurs neither at high free MT1-MMP concentrations where the MT1-MMP·TIMP2·pro-MMP2 species are sparse nor at high MT1-MMP·TIMP2·pro-MMP2 concentrations where there are no free MT1-MMPs. All these maxima lie approximately on a straight line described by the equation [TIMP2] = 0.64 × [MT1-MMP] - 0.74 (nm). Consequently, by considering the aforementioned activation mechanism, maximum pro-MMP2 activation occurs at an initial MT1-MMP/TIMP2 concentration ratio of 3:2. MT1-MMP Ectodomain Shedding—Adopting an approach similar to the one used for studying the pro-MMP2 activation and by using our theoretical model we can gain an insight into the dynamics of ectodomain shedding of two TIMP2-free MT1-MMPs to result in the diffusible MT1cat. This 18-kDa species does not cleave collagen and does not bind to TIMP2 (17Toth M. Hernandez-Barrantes S. Osenkowski P. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Shimura Y. Meroueh O. Kotra L.P. Galvez B.G. Arroyo A.G. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26340-26350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). By considering the intermolecular interactions in solution of free MT1-MMPs lacking their transmembrane region, we can study quantitatively the dynamics of the ectodomain shedding after assigning kinetic constants to the process. These constants describe the kinetics of the formation of a single MT1cat once two TIMP2-free MT1-MMPs encounter each other and one autocatalytically cleaves the other. In the absence of any reported activation kinetics, we adopt the kinetics used in the previous section where the activation constant corresponds to an encounter of two MT1-MMPs, one of them complexed with pro-MMP2, to yield an activated enzyme, MMP2. In the case of ectodomain shedding, the effective “activation” constant is equal to kMT1catshed,eff=2.8×10−3 μm-1 s-1, similar to the effective constant used in the case of pro-MMP2 activation. This assumption may be considered valid as both of the above constants describe the probability of an encounter of two MT1-MMPs that autolytically yields an active species (Fig. 1). The numerical results can help us understand the functionality of MT1cat shedding in an environment where multiple processes, such as pro-MMP2 activation or collagen degradation, occur in parallel. An important result of the model is the indication of a TIMP2-induced regulatory mechanism during ectodomain shedding. The inhibitor TIMP2 can trigger a protective mechanism for MT1-MMPs. Once bound to the membrane type protease it shifts the reaction equilibrium from the ectodomain shedding toward the pro-MMP2 activation path. This pathway antagonism, which is initiated by TIMP2, can be visualized by plotting the molecular balances of the activated MMP2 species and shed MT1-MMPs for different TIMP2 initial concentrations. At low initial MT1-MMP and inhibitor levels the dominating species, after 12 h from the initiation of the biochemical reactions, is the free MT1-MMP (Fig. 3A). By increasing the MT1-MMP initial concentration the ectodomain shedding mechanism is initiated and yields the MT1cat (Fig. 3B) as well as a coordinate reduction in the amount of free MT1-MMP. An increase of TIMP2 concentration initiates the inhibitory mechanism of the surface proteases and shifts the balance toward the MT1-MMP·TIMP2·pro-MMP2 complex, the first step toward pro-MMP2 activation (Fig. 3C). However, at higher initial MT1-MMP levels the ectodomain shedding is predominant over the triple complex formation. As already mentioned, the initiation of the ectodomain shedding mechanism, especially at high TIMP2 concentration levels, yields a decrease in the amount of the triple complex formation, the first step toward pro-MMP2 activation. Also ectodomain shedding induces a decrease in the amount of TIMP2-free MT1-MMP, the activator of the proenzyme. This decrease, as already shown, is prominent especially at high protease levels where the shedding is enhanced. By considering the biochemical network of pro-MMP2 activation, the decrease of these two parameters will reflect a reduction in the amount of MMP2 that gets activated especially at higher MT1-MMP concentration levels where the shedding mechanism is predominant. But it is not only the availability of the MT1-MMP, either free or complexed, that regulates the activation process; the amount of the free TIMP2, as part of the triple complex, affects the above mechanism as well (Fig. 3D). So far in our description we considered the 18-kDa shed part of MT1-MMP that cannot bind TIMP2. Toth et al. (17Toth M. Hernandez-Barrantes S. Osenkowski P. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Shimura Y.

https://openalex.org/W2038701351,"Pex19p is a peroxin involved in peroxisomal membrane biogenesis and probably functions as a chaperone and/or soluble receptor specific for cargo peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). To elucidate the functional constituents of Pex19p in terms of the protein structure, we investigated its domain architecture and binding affinity toward various PMPs and peroxins. The human Pex19p cDNA was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and a highly purified sample of the Pex19p protein was prepared. When PMP22 was synthesized by cell-free translation in the presence of Pex19p, the PMP22 bound to Pex19p was soluble, whereas PMP22 alone was insoluble. This observation shows that Pex19p plays a role in capturing PMP and maintaining its solubility. In a similar manner, Pex19p was bound to PMP70 and Pex16p as well as the Pex3p soluble fragment. Limited proteolysis analyses revealed that Pex19p consists of the C-terminal core domain flanking the flexible N-terminal region. Separation of Pex19p into its N- and C-terminal halves abolished interactions with PMP22, PMP70, and Pex16p. In contrast, the flexible N-terminal half of Pex19p was bound to the Pex3p soluble fragment, suggesting that the binding mode of Pex3p toward Pex19p differs from that of other PMPs. This idea is supported by our detection of the Pex19p-Pex3p-PMP22 ternary complex."

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1446-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). There are four members of the FGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Three of these, FGFRs 1, 2, and 3, clearly contribute to the development of the skeleton (2Ornitz D.M. Marie P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1446-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The FGFs are a family of more than 17 polypeptide ligands (3Ornitz D.M. Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-12Crossref Google Scholar). Given this large number of FGFs and the partially overlapping expression patterns, the identification of the key regulators of chondrocyte differentiation has been difficult. Many studies have shown that FGFs 8 and 10 are essential regulators of limb bud morphogenesis (4Sekine K. Ohuchi H. Fujiwara M. Yamasaki M. Yoshizawa T. Sato T. Yagishita N. Matsui D. Koga Y. Itoh N.

Recently, however, gene-targeting studies in mice have clearly established that FGF18 is essential for bone and cartilage cell differentiation (8Liu Z. Xu J. Colvin J.S. Ornitz D.M.

FGF18 is expressed in the perichondrial sheath and joints of developing endochondral bones as well as the periosteum and osteogenic fronts of membranous bones (8Liu Z. Xu J. Colvin J.S. Ornitz D.M.

Because of the tissue distribution of FGF18 and the phenotype of FGF18 null mice, FGF18 is likely to directly regulate osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation. Studies of cultured chondrocytes and osteoblasts support this hypothesis (12Ellsworth J.L. Berry J. Bukowski T. Claus J. Feldhaus A. Holderman S. Holdren M.S. Lum K.D. Moore E.E. Raymond F. Ren H.

Consequently, understanding the pathways that regulate FGF18 gene expression should yield direct insight into principal controllers of chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation.Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the TGF-β superfamily that were first described based on their capacity to induce heterotopic bone (14Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4449) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have amply demonstrated that when applied to suitable target cells, BMPs rapidly stimulate osteoblast or chondrocyte differentiation (for review see Refs. 15Rosen V. Wozney J.M.

Noggin binds the BMP family members BMP 2, 4, 6, and 7 in the extracellular milieu, and the noggin-BMP complex is unable to bind to or activate BMP receptors (24Zimmerman L.B. De Jesus-Escobar J.M.

Affolter M. Vale W.W. Belmonte J.C. Choe S. Nature. 2002; 420: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Noggin expression is rapidly induced following the activation of BMP receptors and therefore acts as an effective feedback antagonist (26Gazzerro E. Gangji V. Canalis E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Ito H. Akiyama H. Shigeno C. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Noggin is expressed in all developing cartilage and clearly has a vital role as an antagonist of BMP signaling in the regulation of skeletal development. This is evidenced by noggin null mice, which have expanded cartilage elements and joint fusions (28Brunet L.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1455-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations of the human noggin gene cause syndromes with varied joints fusions (29Gong Y. Krakow D. Marcelino J. Wilkin D. Chitayat D. Babul-Hirji R. Hudgins L. Cremers C.W. Cremers F.P. Brunner H.G. Reinker K. Rimoin D.L. Cohn D.H. Goodman F.R. Reardon W. Patton M. Francomano C.A. Warman M.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Therefore, antagonism of BMP signaling by noggin is essential for joint development and determining the size of bone rudiments. Although noggin is induced by BMP signaling, the molecular pathways regulating noggin gene expression are largely uncharacterized.Cytokines or growth factors like FGFs or BMPs and their inhibitors clearly have dramatic effects on chondrocyte gene expression and the development of cartilage. However, relatively little is understood of how these genes are induced or inhibited. Consequently, characterizing the pathways that stimulate growth factor expression will yield insight into the control of chondrogenesis. Many cytokines are induced following receptor-dependent calcium signaling. For example, we have shown that elevations of intracellular calcium induce BMP2 gene expression (30Tomita M. Reinhold M.I. Molkentin J.D. Naski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42214-42218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This in turn promotes chondrocyte gene expression and chondrogenesis. To further understand the effects of calcium signaling on growth factor gene expression and chondrogenesis, we investigated the regulation of FGF18 expression. We show that calcium-calcineurin signaling induces FGF18 expression, as does the calcineurin substrate nuclear factor of activated T-cell 4 (NFAT4). Subsequently, FGF18 represses noggin gene expression and thereby facilitates BMP signaling and chondrogenesis. Significantly, these data demonstrate the diverse effects of FGFs on chondrocytes and their precursors. FGF signaling represses chondrocyte hypertrophy during endochondral ossification (31Naski M.C.

However, at an earlier stage of cartilage development, FGFs may stimulate chondrogenesis by suppressing noggin at sites where FGF and BMP signaling overlap.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—RCJ3.1C5.18 (RCJ) cells were obtained from Jane Aubin (Toronto, Canada) and maintained subconfluent in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Limb bud mesenchymal cells were grown in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing the same supplements. Limb bud mesenchyme was derived from embryonic day 11.5 mouse embryos as previously described (34Edwall-Arvidsson C. Wroblewski J. Anat. Embryol. 1996; 193: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Single cell suspensions were obtained from isolated mouse limb buds (C57Bl/6) following digestion with 0.1% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and 2 mg/ml collagenase IA (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C with agitation. Proteolysis was inhibited with an equal volume of bovine serum, and the suspension was passed through a 70-μm cell strainer. Cell were washed twice with growth medium, suspended at 1–5 × 106 cells/ml, and plated as 20-μl aliquots. 4 h after plating, the wells were flooded with growth medium. Medium was changed every 3 days. In certain experiments, noggin was included at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. Alcian blue staining of formalin-fixed chondrocyte aggregates was done in a 3% acetic acid solution containing 5% Alcian blue (Sigma), pH 3.0. Unbound dye was removed by extensive washing with distilled water.Growth Factors and Antibodies—Antibodies and growth factors were obtained as follows: FGF18 (PeproTech); BMP2, noggin, TGF-β1 (R&D Systems); anti-phosphoSmad1 (Upstate Laboratories); Cy3-goat anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunoresearch); and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Laboratories). Anti-FGFR1 antibody was prepared as described previously (35Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), and anti-FGFR AB6 was a generous gift from A. Baird (Prism Pharmaceuticals).Indirect Immunofluorescence—RCJ cells were cultured on glass coverslips in a 12-well cluster plate. The cells were stimulated with FGF18 (250 ng/ml) or BMP2 (50 ng/ml) for 30 min or 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The samples then were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and again washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Phospho-Smad1 was detected using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% goat serum, 10% fraction V bovine serum albumin, and a 1:500 dilution of anti-phosphoSmad1. Cy3-coupled goat anti-rabbit was used in the same blocking solution at a 1:800 dilution. Detection and deconvolution were performed using a Zeiss Axioskope 2 and Axiovision software (Zeiss).Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNA-Bee (Tel-Test, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA samples were DNase-treated using DNA-free according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). One microgram of DNase-treated RNA was reverse-transcribed in 25 μl at 42 °C for 2 h using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents with random hexamers according to the manufacturer's directions (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed in the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System according to the manufacturer's directions (Applied Biosystems). 25 μl of PCR reactions were made of SYBR Green 2× PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 5 pmols of each forward and reverse primer, and 3 μl of cDNA. Cycling conditions were 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C. Primers were designed using Primer3 software (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research) with melting temperatures ranging from 59 to 61 °C and amplicons ranging from 130 to 162 base pairs. Primer pairs were tested so that the melting curve analysis of the PCR products showed a single peak. In addition, PCR products were cloned and sequenced for verification. Oligonucleotides used were as follows: mouse ubiquitin sense, 5′-CGGTCTTTCTGTGAGGGTGT-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCACTGGGCTCCACCTCTA-3′; mouse noggin sense, 5′-TGAGGTGCACAGACTTGGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGTACGCGTGGAATGACCTA-3′; and mouse FGF18 sense, 5′-CCCAGGACTTGAATGTGCTT-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACTGCTGTGCTTCCAGGTTC-3′.Chelation of intracellular calcium-RCJ cells were loaded with 30 μm BAPTA-AM (Sigma) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.12 m NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed twice with the same buffer without BAPTA-AM. The cells then were stimulated with 1.5 ng/ml TGF-β1 in conditioned Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 8 h at 37 °C.Adenoviruses—Adenoviral constructs were made as previously described (36Delling U. Tureckova J. Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Rotwein P. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6600-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses Smad7, Smad6, and dominant negative ALK6KR (37Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) were generously supplied by M. Fujii. Adenoviruses were titered by limiting dilution. Infection at a multiplicity of infection of 10 ensured that greater that 95% of the cells were infected as assessed by lacZ staining or indirect immunofluorescence of the transduced protein.Northern Blotting—RNA was prepared from cells using RNeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10–20 μg of total RNA was loaded to a low formaldehyde 1% agarose gel. Samples were fractionated and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Gelman). Membranes were hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled aggrecan (p1355 plasmid provided by Y. Yamada National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (pTRI-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Ambion) cDNA fragments. DNA probes were labeled with a Prime-It kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Relative levels of gene expression were determined by phosphorimaging analysis using a Molecular Dynamics Storm. For each sample, the level of mRNA was normalized to a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or 18 S rRNA internal control.Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting—Western blots and immunoprecipitations were done as previously described (35Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). RCJ cells were lysed with 1% deoxycholate and 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.25 mm orthovanadate (Sigma), and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-FGFR1 absorbed to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Blots were probed with the indicated antibodies and detected by chemiluminescence with the West Dura Extended substrate (Pierce).In Situ Hybridization—Radiolabeled riboprobes were hybridized to formalin-fixed EDTA-decalcified tissue sections from 14-day-old littermates. Probe synthesis and hybridization were done as described previously (31Naski M.C. Colvin J.S. Coffin J.D. Ornitz D.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4977-4988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The noggin template for riboprobes synthesis was a gift from R. Harland (University of California).Statistical Analyses—Statistical comparisons were done using an unpaired Student's t test. The null hypothesis was rejected for p < 0.05.RESULTSStimulation of Chondrogenesis by Elevation of Intracellular Calcium—Cultures of mesenchymal cells derived from the limb buds of 11.5 day post-coitus mouse embryos undergo chondrogenesis when plated at a high cell density in vitro (38Ahrens P.B. Solursh M. Reiter R.S. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). To understand calcium-dependent signaling in this process, we treated limb bud cultures with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. We found that ionomycin stimulated chondrogenesis in these cultures as evidenced by a dramatic increase in the number of Alcian blue-staining nodules (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the differentiation of immortalized chondrocytic cells (RCJ3.1C5.18) was stimulated by 1 μm ionomycin as shown by increased expression of the chondrocyte-specific gene, aggrecan (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that calcium-dependent signals stimulate chondrocyte differentiation, and in other work (30Tomita M. Reinhold M.I. Molkentin J.D. Naski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42214-42218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we show that the calcium-dependent pathway requires calcineurin. We showed that, when activated, calcineurin induces BMP2 gene expression and that differentiation in these culture systems proceeds via a BMP-dependent pathway (30Tomita M. Reinhold M.I. Molkentin J.D. Naski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42214-42218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Calcium-dependent Signaling Induces FGF18 Expression— To further characterize the effects of calcium-dependent signals on chondrocyte differentiation and gene expression, we asked whether calcium signaling alters FGF18 gene expression. FGF18 is an essential regulator of chondrocyte differentiation during endochondral bone growth and thereby a potential target for the effects of calcium signaling on chondrocyte differentiation. Interestingly, we found that FGF18 expression is induced up to 12-fold by the calcium ionophore, ionomycin (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Induction of FGF18 gene expression. FGF18 expression relative to ubiquitin was determined by quantitative PCR following reverse transcription of RNA isolated from RCJ cells. A, time course of FGF18 induction following treatment with 1 μm ionomycin (iono). B, time course of FGF18 induction following treatment with 1 μm ionomycin with or without 5 μg/ml cyclosporin A (CspA). C, FGF18 expression in RCJ cells following transduction of β-galactosidase (Adβ-gal) or activated calcineurin (AdΔCnA). D, FGF18 expression in RCJ cells following transduction of β-galactosidase or activated NFAT4 (AdΔNFAT4). Cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10. FGF18 expression is normalized to ubiquitin. Error bars represent mean ± S.D. E, FGF receptor phosphotyrosine Western blot. RCJ cells were stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin for 5 h in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml cyclosporin A. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-FGFR1 antibody, and Western blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) (top) or monoclonal pan anti-FGFR antibodies (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the signaling pathways required for the induction of FGF18 gene expression, we asked whether calcineurin is required. Calcineurin is a calcium-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase that is specifically inhibited by cyclosporin A. Interestingly, cyclosporin A completely inhibits the induction of FGF18 by ionomycin (Fig. 2B). In addition, the expression of an activated form of calcineurin A lacking the N-terminal regulatory domain (ΔCnA) was sufficient to induce FGF18 expression in chondrocytic RCJ cells. Recombinant adenovirus AdΔCnA induced FGF18 5-fold (p = 0.01) relative to a control virus transducing β-galactosidase (Fig. 2C). In addition, the transcription factor and calcineurin substrate, NFAT4, induced FGF18 expression. Adenoviral transduction of an activated form of NFAT4 (Fig. 2D) in RCJ cells induced FGF18 6-fold (p = 0.05) relative to a control virus. We conclude that the induction of FGF18 gene expression by elevated levels of intracellular calcium requires the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin.To determine whether the activation of FGF18 expression by ionomycin stimulates FGF signaling, we assessed FGF receptor activation by phosphotyrosine Western blotting. Consistent with the activation of FGF18 expression, Fig. 2E shows that ionomycin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the FGF receptor. Additionally, cyclosporin A represses the induction of FGF receptor autophosphorylation.FGF Signaling Induces Chondrogenesis and Inhibits Noggin Expression—Because calcium-dependent signals induce both chondrocyte differentiation and FGF18 expression, we asked whether the induction of FGF18 and subsequent FGF receptor signaling contribute to calcium-induced chondrogenesis. FGF18 is a potent ligand for FGF receptor 3 (12Ellsworth J.L. Berry J. Bukowski T. Claus J. Feldhaus A. Holderman S. Holdren M.S. Lum K.D. Moore E.E. Raymond F. Ren H. Shea P. Sprecher C. Storey H.

Therefore, we used a constitutively active FGFR3 as a substitute for FGF18 to assess for effects on chondrogenesis. Using a recombinant adenovirus, FGFR3 containing an activating mutation (FGFR3-R248C) was transduced into limb bud mesenchymal cultures. The results showing Alcian blue staining of differentiated cultures (Fig. 3, A and B) indicate that FGF receptor signaling strongly augments differentiation as evidenced by a substantial increase in the size of the cartilage nodules and a 50% increase (p = 0.002) in the number of cartilage nodules in FGFR3-R248C-transduced cultures relative to a control culture transduced with β-galactosidase. We conclude that FGF receptor signaling can enhance chondrogenesis and posit that calcium-calcineurin-dependent induction of FGF18 expression contributes to chondrocyte differentiation.Fig. 3FGF receptor 3 promotes chondrogenesis. A, chondrogenesis in limb bud mesenchyme cultures transduced with β-galactosidase (Adβ-gal) or activated FGF receptor 3 (AdFGFR3). Cartilage nodules were stained with Alcian blue. B, comparison of the number of cartilage nodules determined in cultures transduced with activated FGF receptor 3 or β-galactosidase adenovirus. Error bars represent mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar to chondrogenesis in vivo, the limb bud differentiation assay is highly dependent on BMP signaling. Blocking BMP signaling with dominant negative receptors or BMP antagonists abolishes cartilage development (39Kawakami Y. Ishikawa T. Shimabara M. Tanda N. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Iwamoto M. Kuwana T. Ueki A. Noji S. Nohno T. Development. 1996; 122: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Pizette S. Niswander L. Dev. Biol. 2000; 219: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Conversely, constitutive BMP receptors or excess BMP augment differentiation (41Duprez D. Bell E.J. Richardson M.K. Archer C.W. Wolpert L. Brickell P.M. Francis-West P.H. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 42Zou H. Wieser R. Massague J. Niswander L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2191-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The finding that FGF signaling augments chondrogenesis (Fig. 3A) suggests that BMP signaling is enhanced by FGF. This could be achieved by several mechanisms including the induction of BMP gene expression or suppression of BMP antagonists. FGF18 did not induce the expression of BMP2 (Fig. 4A), BMP4, or growth differentiation factor 5 (data not shown). However, FGF18 did repress the expression of the BMP antagonist, noggin. Noggin expression was induced in chondrocytic RCJ cells by stimulation with BMP2 in the presence or absence of FGF18. Noggin was induced 10-fold following the addition of BMP2 (Fig. 4B). However, noggin induction was substantially repressed by the addition of FGF18 (10-fold increase in the absence, 2-fold increase in the presence of FGF18). Similarly, chondrocytic RCJ cells transduced with an activated FGF receptor (FGFR3-R248C) showed a 92% (p = 0.02) reduction of noggin expression following stimulation with BMP2 compared with a control β-galactosidase adenovirus (Fig. 4C). Also, treatment of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cell cultures with FGF18 repressed noggin gene expression relative to vehicle-treated control samples (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, adding exogenous noggin to limb bud cultures wherein FGF18 is induced by ionomycin results in a repression of chondrogenesis (Fig. 4E). Lastly, we find that noggin expression is reduced in transgenic mice expressing an activated FGFR3 (FGFR-3-G380R) in cartilage. Fig. 5 shows bright- and dark-field images of the epiphyseal growth plate from wild-type mice or transgenic mice expressing FGFR3-G380R driven by the type II collagen promoter (31Naski M.C. Colvin J.S. Coffin J.D. Ornitz D.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4977-4988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dark-field in situ shows that noggin transcripts are substantially reduced in the cartilage of the transgenic mice. These data support the conclusion that FGF18 can augment BMP signaling by suppressing the expression of the BMP antagonist, noggin. Additional evidence in support of this stems from results showing that (i) FGF18 augments the expression of aggrecan, a BMP-inducible g"

The role of chemokines in the recruitment process is highly regulated spatially and temporally and involves interactions with G protein-coupled receptors and cell surface glycosaminoglycans. The dynamic equilibrium between chemokine monomers and dimers, both free in solution and in cell surface-bound forms, regulates different components of recruitment such as chemotaxis and receptor signaling. The binding and activity of the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) for its receptors, previously studied using “trapped” non-associating monomers and non-dissociating dimers, show that the monomer has a native-like function but support conflicting roles for the dimer. We have measured the binding of native IL-8 to the CXCR1 N-domain, using isothermal titration calorimetry and sedimentation equilibrium techniques. The N-domain constitutes a critical binding site, and IL-8 binding affinity to the receptor N-domain is in the same concentration range as the IL-8 monomerdimer equilibrium. We observed that only the IL-8 monomer, and not the dimer, is competent in binding the receptor N-domain. Based on our results, we propose that IL-8 dimerization functions as a negative regulator for the receptor function and as a positive regulator for binding to glycosaminoglycans and that both play a role in the neutrophil recruitment process.

Chemokines, the largest subfamily of cytokines, play a fundamental role in diverse biological processes from organogenesis and leukocyte trafficking to host immune response against infection (1Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar, 2Locati M. Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev.

These processes involve movement of cells from one site to another, and an imbalance in the chemokine response is a major causative factor in the pathophysiology of various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cancer. Moreover, chemokine receptors also function as co-receptors for human immunodeficiency virus infection (4Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Therefore, knowledge of how chemokines mediate function is of significant interest for therapeutic intervention. Chemokines exert their function by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; IL-8, interleukin-8; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; CXCR1, CXC chemokine receptor-1; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. on target cells, evoking such biological responses as cell shape change and downstream signaling, and by binding to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAG) for rolling and extravasation of the target cells. Chemokines are classified into CXC, CC, CX3C, and C families on the basis of conserved cysteines near the N terminus. A characteristic feature of chemokines is the observation that they form dimers. Even chemokines observed as monomers in solution at millimolar concentration in NMR studies are observed as dimers under crystallization conditions. These observations suggest that all chemokines dimerize and that dimerization plays a fundamental role in some aspect(s) of chemokine function. Under transient conditions that favor leukocyte recruitment, the chemokine concentration could reach levels high enough so that they form dimers. Recent studies also show that chemokines either bind as dimers or dimerize on binding to GAGs on endothelial cells, and such binding is important for leukocyte recruitment. Clearly, chemokines exist in a dynamic equilibrium between the solution and cell surface-bound monomer and dimer forms, and this equilibrium regulates interaction with GPCRs and GAGs in recruiting leukocytes. Therefore, knowledge of the similarities and the differences in the binding of the monomers and dimers for GPCRs and GAGs is critical for understanding their function. Interleukin-8 (IL-8; also called CXCL8), a CXC chemokine that recruits neutrophils during inflammatory events by binding the receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, is one of the best studied members of the chemokine family. Both NMR and x-ray structures show it to be a dimer (5Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 6Baldwin E.T. Weber I.T. St. Charles R. Xuan J.C. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Edwards B.F. Clore G.M.

IL-8 dimerization is sensitive to solution conditions, and the reported dissociation constants (Kd) vary by as much as 160-fold (0.1–16 μm), indicating that IL-8 could easily dimerize under in vivo conditions (7Burrows S.D. Doyle M.L. Murphy K.P. Franklin S.G. White J.R. Brooks I. McNulty D.E. Scott M.O. Knutson J.R. Porter D. Young P.R. Hensley P.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A variety of in vitro cell-based and in vivo studies also suggest dimerization of IL-8 on binding to GAGs (9Frevert C.W. Goodman R.B. Kinsella M.G. Kajikawa O. Ballman K. Clark-Lewis I. Proudfoot A.E. Wells T.N. Martin T.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3550-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Hoogewerf A.J.

IL-8 is active for GPCR function at nanomolar concentrations in in vitro cell-based assays, suggesting that IL-8 binds its receptor as a monomer. Indeed, we and others (8Lowman H.B. Fairbrother W.J.

Clark-Lewis I. Science. 1994; 264: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) have shown that obligate IL-8 monomers have the same in vitro receptor activity as the native protein. Our trapped monomer was generated by modifying a dimer-interface backbone amide proton with a bulky methyl group; the observation that this monomer had native activity also rules out IL-8 dimerization on receptor binding as the same mechanism that prevents dimerization in solution also prevents dimerization on the receptor. Whether preformed IL-8 dimers have the same potency as monomers in binding their receptors is less clear. The 100–1000-fold difference between binding constant and monomer/dimer equilibrium limits studying the binding of native IL-8 dimer to the receptor. This question has been addressed using non-dissociating dimers that contain disulfide cross-links across the interface but provide conflicting results (12Leong S.R. Lowman H.B. Liu J. Shire S.

A concern with the cross-linking approach is whether the native dimer structure is conserved. The structures of these disulfide-linked dimers are not known, so it is not clear whether these cross-linked dimers are the same as “native” dimer or linked at locations that allow the protein to function as a monomer or modify the protein structure and so affect function. We have now studied the binding of native IL-8 to the CXCR1 N-domain peptide using titration calorimetry and sedimentation equilibrium methods. The receptor N-domain constitutes a critical binding site, and structure-function studies have shown that IL-8 binds the isolated N-domain with an affinity similar to that for the N-domain in the intact receptor, and also this affinity is in the same range as the dimer dissociation constant (15Gayle R.B.

These properties allow studying binding under conditions where substantial populations of both IL-8 monomer and dimer exist. We also used a “trapped” monomer as a control in all these experiments. In an isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiment, change in heat during the titration is measured and is the composite of all binding interactions in solution; in the sedimentation equilibrium experiment, average mass is measured and is the composite of the different species present in solution. Both experiments show that only the IL-8 monomer, and not the dimer, binds the receptor N-domain and further that the dissociation of dimeric IL-8 precedes binding. Based on our results, we propose that IL-8 dimerization functions as a negative regulator for receptor function. Protein and Peptide Synthesis—The native IL-8, trapped IL-8 L25NMe monomer, and rabbit CXCR1 N-domain peptide were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis as described previously (11Rajarathnam K. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Dewald B. Geiser T. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Science. 1994; 264: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 17Rajagopalan L. Rajarathnam K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30000-30008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and the correctness of the synthesis was verified using electrospray mass spectrometry. The L25NMe monomer was a kind gift of Dr. Ian Clark-Lewis. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Studies—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out using a Beckman-Coulter XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with An-60 titanium rotors at 25 °C using absorbance optics at 280 nm. The average molecular weight (Mav) was calculated using the following equation. Mav=2RT(1−νρ)ω2×d(lnC)d(r2)(Eq. 1) For all experiments, the total concentration was calculated so that the A280 of the samples was between ∼0.5 and 1. In different samples, the concentration of IL-8 varied from 5 to 120 μm (in monomeric unit) and of the N-domain peptide varied from 6 to 66 μm. The average molecular weights determined for the different mixtures were observed to be essentially independent for experimental variables such as rotor speeds, starting concentration, and buffers. ITC—Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed using the VP-ITC system (MicroCal) at 25 °C. All proteins were extensively dialyzed for 8–12 h against the buffer, centrifuged, filtered, and degassed before use. In a typical experiment, ∼0.6 mm IL-8 was injected into the 1.42-ml sample cell containing ∼0.06 mm receptor N-domain peptide. The heats of dilution of the peptide and the buffer were small compared with the heat of binding and were subtracted from the experimental titration results. Data were then fitted using a nonlinear least squares routine using a single-site binding model in Origin for ITC v.5.0 (Microcal), varying the stoichiometry (n), binding constant (Kb), and binding enthalpy (ΔH0). IL-8 binding and receptor activation involve two interactions, between the ligand N-terminal loop and the receptor N-domain residues (site-I) and between the ligand N-terminal and the receptor juxtamembrane domain residues (site-II). Structure-function studies show that site-I is a high affinity interaction and serves to dock the ligand on the receptor, and site-II is a low affinity high specificity interaction and is involved in activating the receptor (14Clark-Lewis I. Kim K-S. Rajarathnam K. Gong J-H. Dewald B. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). IL-8 binds the CXCR1 receptor with nm affinity (Kd ∼3 nm), and IL-8 N-terminal mutants bind the receptor with micromolar affinity, indicating that site-I interaction corresponds to micromolar affinity. IL-8 binds the isolated CXCR1 N-domain with an affinity similar to that for the N-domain in the intact receptor, indicating that the structural requirements for the site-I interaction can be studied outside the context of the intact receptor. As IL-8 monomer-dimer equilibrium is in the same μm range, we have exploited these properties to study binding using ultracentrifugation and ITC techniques under conditions where native IL-8 is at monomer-dimer equilibrium. We have used the L25NMe monomer that has native activity as a control. The trapped L25NMe has been well characterized and has been used in a number of functional studies (9Frevert C.W. Goodman R.B.

Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Science. 1994; 264: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We have solved its structure by solution NMR spectroscopy and observed its structure to be similar to that of the monomer in the dimeric structure (18Rajarathnam K. Clark-Lewis I. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12983-12990Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium is the technique of choice for determining dimerization constants and can also be used to detect binding between proteins and is the only technique that measures binding interactions on the basis of molecular weights of the different species in solution. Therefore, this technique is ideally suited to detect binding interactions of the native IL-8 under conditions where multiple species could exist in solution. Sedimentation equilibrium profiles of the individual species and of the mixtures plotted as lnC versus r2 are shown in Fig. 1. Such plots are easy to interpret, as the slopes are proportional to the average molecular weight of the species in solution. The data for the receptor N-domain and trapped L25NMe monomer could be fitted to a single species, and the experimental molecular weights corresponded to the calculated molecular weights (N-domain, 3.4 kDa; trapped monomer, 8.0 kDa). The data for native IL-8 could not be fitted to a single-species model but fit to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 4 μm. For native IL-8: receptor N-domain mixture, the sedimentation profile showed a smaller slope than that for the IL-8 dimer, indicating dissociation of the dimer and not binding to the dimer; the observed molecular weight of ∼11 kDa suggested the formation of a 1:1 complex between IL-8 monomer and the N-domain peptide. Experiments carried out at different molar ratios, including at excess N-domain or excess IL-8, showed no evidence of higher molecular weight species that could be attributed to N-domain binding to the native dimer (2:1 or 2:2 complexes). Indeed, sedimentation profiles for the monomer IL-8:receptor N-domain mixture were similar to that observed that for native IL-8, indicating formation of a 1:1 complex. We also carried out sedimentation velocity experiments that can provide insight into the stoichiometry of the complexes, and the data indicated interactions similar to that observed in the sedimentation equilibrium experiments and showed no evidence of binding to an IL-8 dimer (data not shown). In summary, these experiments indicate that it is the monomer that binds to the receptor N-domain and that dimer dissociation is essential for binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry is the most direct method to accurately measure the thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions and can further provide the stoichiometry of the complex. In an ITC experiment, the net change in heat released or absorbed is measured and is the composite of all interactions that occur during the titration. ITC data for the native IL-8 and trapped monomer are shown in Fig. 2. The upper panels show thermograms recorded as a function of IL-8 (L) added to the N-domain peptide (R) that have been integrated with respect to time and normalized per mole of added ligand, and the lower panels show the integrated heats plotted as a function of molar L/R ratio. The IL-8 concentration in the syringe is high and exists as a dimer (∼0.6 mm), and the receptor peptide in the sample cell is a monomer. We discuss various possible binding interactions and the binding stoichiometry (n = L/R) on titrating IL-8 dimer into the receptor N-domain peptide. In model A, IL-8 dimer does not dissociate and binds two moles of receptor N-domain (n = 0.5); in model B, IL-8 dimer does not dissociate and binds 1 mol of receptor N-domain (n = 1); in model C, IL-8 dimer dissociates, and each monomer binds one receptor N-domain (n = 0.5); and in model D, IL-8 dimer dissociates, and each monomer binds 2 mol of receptor N-domain (n = 0.25).L2+2R↔L2R2(n=0.5)(Model A) L2+R↔L2R(n=1)(Model B) 1/2L2+R↔LR(n=0.5)(Model C) 1/2L2+2R↔LR2(n=0.25)(Model D) Accordingly, on fitting the data, an “n” value of 1, 0.5, or 0.25 would indicate binding according to one of the above models, whereas an n value in between would indicate multiple binding events. An n value of 0.5 was obtained, ruling out multiple binding events and also models B and D. Model A can be ruled out on the basis that sedimentation equilibrium experiments showed no evidence of molecular weights corresponding to an L2R2 complex. Only model C is in agreement with the experimental data, which are also consistent with the molecular weights determined in sedimentation experiments. Furthermore, the ITC data for the IL-8 monomer could be fitted to a single-site model with an n value of 1 that corresponds to a single monomer binding to a single N-domain peptide (panel B). The observed enthalpies, stoichiometry, and binding constants for native IL-8 and monomer are summarized in Table I.Table IThermodynamic parameters for the binding of native IL-8 and L25NMe monomer to CXCR1N-domain as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry in 50 mm NaCl,50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, buffer at 25 °CLigandnKdΔH-TΔSΔGμmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molNative IL-80.557.1-7.0-0.3-7.3Monomer1.126.0-10.53.4-7.1 Open table in a new tab Structural Basis of IL-8 Dimer Binding—Our ITC and sedimentation equilibrium studies on IL-8 binding to the receptor N-domain unambiguously demonstrate that only the IL-8 monomer is competent to bind the receptor N-domain. On the basis of our data, we provide a thermodynamic linkage scheme (Fig. 3). According to this model, the dimer does not bind the receptor N-domain, and binding of the monomer is coupled to dimer dissociation. The receptor N-domain constitutes a critical binding site and is responsible for most of the binding energy, so our results have direct relevance to IL-8 binding to the intact receptor, suggesting that the IL-8 dimer does not bind the intact receptor with the same affinity as the monomer. It has been reported previously from competitive inhibition experiments that CXCR1 N-domain peptides bind IL-8 with a binding constant (Kd) of ∼15 μm (15Gayle R.B. Sleath P.R. Srinivason S.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the former experiments, ∼1 nm of radiolabeled IL-8 was competed with increasing concentrations of unlabeled N-domain peptide, whereas in the latter NMR experiment, unlabeled peptide was added to a 0.75 mm15N-labeled IL-8 sample. IL-8 is a monomer in the competitive binding experiments, and its Kd is in agreement with our Kd of ∼8 μm from ITC and our observation that only the monomer binds in the presence of both monomer and dimer. Under NMR experimental conditions, IL-8 is a dimer, and the observed Kd of 170 μm suggests that the dimer binds the N-domain peptide with much lower affinity. This observation is also consistent with our observation that the monomeric state is critical for high affinity binding. The importance of IL-8 dimer dissociation for receptor binding and function has been studied previously using disulfide-linked IL-8 dimers (12Leong S.R. Lowman H.B. Liu J. Shire S. Deforge L.E.

These dimer mimics showed native IL-8 binding and functional response both in neutrophils and mammalian cells expressing the individual receptors (12Leong S.R. Lowman H.B. Liu J. Shire S.

Chemical shift differences were observed for the helical residues 61, 62, 65, 66, 70, and 71, suggesting that the helix packing is perturbed. Therefore it is possible that the newly introduced disulfides actually destabilize the dimer interface, so these dimer mimics in effect have the functional properties of a monomer. In contrast to these studies, an R26C disulfide mutant that contains a single disulfide across the interface has been reported to be ∼15-fold less active (14Clark-Lewis I. Kim K-S. Rajarathnam K. Gong J-H. Dewald B. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Unlike other dimer constructs, R26C has only one single disulfide about the 2-fold symmetry axis. Examination of the IL-8 dimer structure shows that mutating Arg to Cys and the formation of the disulfide is unlikely to perturb the native structure, so the R26C disulfide dimer could function as native dimer. The decreased activity of the R26C dimer is in agreement with our observation that native dimer does not bind to the receptor N-domain peptide. We propose the lower binding affinity of the dimer is not due to structural constraints but due to its reduced conformational flexibility and that dimerization locks the protein into a low-affinity conformation. The IL-8 dimer structure shows that the binding interfaces are on the opposite ends of the protein. Amide proton exchange rates, which are diagnostic of conformational flexibility, are observed to be slower in the dimer compared with the monomer. This observation strongly suggests that the decreased binding of the dimer is due to conformational constraints and that the greater flexibility observed in the monomer is essential for high affinity binding (11Rajarathnam K.

Role of Monomer-Dimer Equilibrium for in Vivo Function—A remarkable number of protein classes form reversible homodimers, and such an association has been observed to regulate diverse biological functions from protein folding and stability to ligand binding, catalysis, and signaling (20Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Structure determination indicates that many chemokines dimerize, and the observation that chemokine dimerization is also coupled to binding to GAGs suggests that all chemokines form dimers and/or higher order oligomers (21Fernandez E.J.

Monomeric mutants of CXC and CC chemokines observed as dimers and tetramers in NMR and x-ray structures show the same activity as the native protein, indicating unambiguously that a monomer is competent for receptor function (11Rajarathnam K.

Our observation that the IL-8 dimer does not bind the receptor N-domain indicates that the IL-8 dimer compared with the monomer is less competent in binding the receptor and that the dimer is a negative regulator for CXCR1 function. Our observation that IL-8 functions as a negative regulator for receptor function has direct relevance for in vivo function. It is very likely that in vivo, IL-8 exists in dynamic equilibrium between the solution and cell surface-bound monomer and dimer forms. Under conditions of insult such as bacterial infection, IL-8 mediates neutrophil recruitment from the blood-stream to the underlying tissue, and it is believed that IL-8 continues to play a role in directing the neutrophils to their destination in the tissue. Once reaching their destination, neutrophils release proteases and oxygen radicals for destroying the pathogens. All these steps involve interactions with GAGs and GPCR, and the ability to exist in two forms, both in the free and cell-bound form, allows fine-tuning the recruitment process. Self-association provides a mechanism by which IL-8 dimerization functions as a negative regulator for the receptor function and as a positive regulator for binding to GAGs, and both play a role in the neutrophil recruitment process. We propose that the dimeric forms of all chemokines function as negative regulators for their GPCR functions. We thank Drs.

To test the hypothesis that CKIP-1 has a role in targeting CK2 to specific locations, we examined the effects of CKIP-1 on the localization of CK2. These studies demonstrated that CKIP-1 can recruit CK2 to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the pleckstrin homology domain of CKIP-1 was found to be required for interactions with CK2 and for the recruitment of CK2 to the plasma membrane. In this regard, point mutations in this domain abolish membrane localization and compromise interactions with CK2. In addition, replacement of the pleckstrin homology domain with a myristoylation signal was insufficient to elicit any interaction with CK2. An investigation of the lipid binding of CKIP-1 reveals that it has broad specificity. A comparison with other pleckstrin homology domains revealed that the pleckstrin homology domain of CKIP-1 is distinct from other defined classes of pleckstrin homology domains. Finally, examination of CK2α for a region that mediates interactions with CKIP-1 revealed a putative HIKE domain, a complex motif found exclusively in proteins that bind pleckstrin homology domains. However, mutations within this motif were not able to abolish CKIP-1-CK2 interactions suggesting that this motif by itself may not be sufficient to mediate interactions. Overall, these results provide novel insights into how CK2, a predominantly nuclear enzyme, is targeted to the plasma membrane, and perhaps more importantly how it may be regulated.

Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Interestingly enough, the interaction between PP2A and CK2α was mapped to one of the few areas of non-identity between α and α′ in the N-terminal 330 amino acids (21Heriche J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the subcellular localization of CK2 and its ability to phosphorylate a number of its target proteins may be regulated by interactions with specific protein partners (37Bosc D.G.

Clearly, this could explain why a predominantly nuclear enzyme has been reported to phosphorylate cytoplasmic and plasma membrane bound targets. To test the hypothesis that specific functions of CK2α and CK2α′ are mediated by unique interaction partners, a yeast two-hybrid strategy was utilized to search for novel interacting partners. Using full-length CK2α and CK2α′ GAL4 binding domain fusions as bait, we isolated a novel CK2-interacting protein designated CKIP-1 (37Bosc D.G. Graham K.C. Saulnier R.B. Zhang C. Prober D. Gietz R.D. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14295-14306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which interacted with CK2α, but not α′ in yeast two-hybrid assays. Interactions between CK2 were subsequently confirmed using GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation from transfected and non-transfected cells indicating that CKIP-1 and CK2 interact under physiological conditions (37Bosc D.G. Graham K.C. Saulnier R.B. Zhang C. Prober D. Gietz R.D. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14295-14306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CKIP-1 cDNA is broadly expressed and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 46 kDa. Although its overall biological functions remain poorly understood, CKIP-1 has recently been implicated in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-regulated muscle cell differentiation (38Safi A. Vandromme M. Caussanel S. Valdacci L. Baas D. Vidal M. Brun G. Schaeffer L. Goillot E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Examination of the amino acid sequence of CKIP-1 revealed the presence of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which could mediate interactions between CKIP-1 and cellular membranes or proteins, and a putative C-terminal leucine zipper, which is thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions (37Bosc D.G. Graham K.C. Saulnier R.B. Zhang C. Prober D. Gietz R.D. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14295-14306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, this protein contains five PXXP motifs, two of which match the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases and mitogen-activated kinases. Based on the fact that CKIP-1 contains a number of protein-protein interaction motifs, and its discrete cellular localization, we hypothesized that CKIP-1 is a non-enzymatic regulator of CK2. To test this hypothesis we examined the interactions between CK2 and CKIP-1 in cells and in vitro. Our data demonstrate that CKIP-1 is capable of redistributing CK2 to the plasma membrane and that the PH domain of CKIP-1 is required for this activity. This demonstration provides novel insight into a possible mechanism for how CK2, a predominantly nuclear enzyme, is capable of phosphorylating proteins present at the cellular membrane. Human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells and U2-OS cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CanSera International, Inc.). Anti-CKIP-1 antibodies were raised in rabbits by BabCO (Richmond, CA) as previously described (37Bosc D.G. Graham K.C. Saulnier R.B. Zhang C. Prober D. Gietz R.D. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14295-14306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and anti-GST monoclonal antibodies, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies, and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Sigma; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad. PIP-Strips were obtained from Echelon Research Laboratories Inc., and reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) were obtained from Pierce. Plasmids encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP-C1) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP-C1) were obtained from Clontech, Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene, and Fugene6 transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Applied Science. AirVol was from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.; all other reagents were of reagent grade. pEYFP Construct—Full-length CK2α was amplified out of pGBT9-CK2α using the following forward 5′-TTG ACT GTA TCG CCG AAT TCC CCG GGG ATC CTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTT GGC TGC AGG GTC GAC GAT CCC CCG GGC-3′ primers. The amplified product was gel-purified and ligated into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) then digested with EcoRI and SalI. The respective EcoRI/SalI fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pEYFP-C1. pECFP Constructs—Full-length CKIP-1 was amplified out of pGBT9-CKIP-1 using the following forward 5′-AC TGT ATC GCC GAA TTC CCC ATG ATG AAG A-3′ and reverse 5′-CTT GGC TGC AGG GTC GAC CCA CCC TGC CCT-3′ primers. The PCR product was gel-purified, ligated into the pCR-Blunt vector, digested with EcoRI and SalI, and subcloned into EcoRI/SalI-digested pECFP-C1 (Clontech). A monomeric form of ECFP-C1 was constructed by incorporating an A206K mutation as described previously (39Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) using a sequential PCR strategy. pEGFP Constructs—Full-length cDNA encoding CKIP-1 was subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pEGFP-C3 vector. To examine the residues important for interactions with CK2, key residues within the PH domain (Lys-42, Arg-44, and Trp-123) of CKIP-1 were mutated. Full-length cDNA encoding CKIP-1, as described previously (37Bosc D.G. Graham K.C. Saulnier R.B. Zhang C. Prober D. Gietz R.D. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14295-14306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), incorporated into a pEGFP vector (pRSP9), was utilized as the template in a PCR reaction to amplify the DNA and incorporate specific point mutations. To begin with, W123A was incorporated into the full-length cDNA using sequential PCR. The first two PCR products for the W123A mutation were generated using the CKIP-1 forward primer 5′-TGA TCA GAA TTC CCA TGA TGA AGA AGA ACA ATT CCG CCA AG-3′ and the W123A reverse primer with 5′-AAT GAT CCA CGA TTC CTT CTC TTC-3′, and the W123A forward primer 5′-GAA GAG AAG GAA TCG GCG ATC AAT GCC CTC-3′ with the CKIP-1 reverse primer 5′-GAA TTC GTC GAC CCC ACC CTG CCC TCA CAT CAG G-3′. These products were gel-purified and added to a second PCR reaction mixture along with the CKIP-1 forward and reverse primers. The PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into pCR-Blunt. The clone was then digested with EcoRI/SalI, and the respective fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI-digested pEGFP-C3 vector to create a construct with an N-terminal GFP tag. The sequence of this clone, pMO7, was confirmed by sequencing using the pEGFP-C primer. The K42C mutant, R44C mutant, and K42C/R44C double mutant were made in a similar fashion, using K42C forward 5′-TTC AGG GAG ATT TGG TGT AAC CGC TAT GTG-3′ and K42C reverse 5′-GCG GTT ACA CCA AAT CTC CCT GAA-3′ primers, R44C forward 5′-GGG AGA TTT GGA AAA ACT GCT ATG TGG TGC TG-3′ and R44C reverse 5′-CAC ATA GCA GTT TTT CCA AAT CTC CC-3′ primers, and K42C/R44C forward 5′-TTC AGG GAG ATT TGG TGT AAC TGC TAT GTG-3′ and K42C/R44C reverse 5′-GCA GTT ACA CCA AAT CTC CCT GAA-3′ primers, respectively, along with the CKIP-1 primer set. The resulting clones, pMO9, pMO55, and pCZ12, respectively, were confirmed by sequencing using the pEGFP-C primer. pMO7 was used as the template to construct the double mutants containing K42C and W123A, and R44C and W123A, and the triple mutant containing K42C, R44C, and W123A. PCR was used to create point mutations utilizing either K42C primers or R44C primers for the double mutants, and the K42C/R44C primers for the triple mutant. The resulting clones, pMO12, pMO54, and pMO13, respectively, were verified by sequencing using the pEGFP-C primer. Myc-CK2β-CAAX Construct—To construct a membrane localized form of CK2β, we incorporated the Ras membrane-targeting signal as described by Clark et al. (40Clark G.J. Quilliam L.A. Hisaka M.M. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) at the immediate C-terminal of Myc-CK2β. The Ras membrane-targeting signal is a 19 amino acid peptide ending in CAAX, where C = cysteine, A = aliphatic amino acid, and X = any amino acid (40Clark G.J. Quilliam L.A. Hisaka M.M. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was designated Myc-CK2β-CAAX. pACT2 Constructs—Full-length cDNA encoding CKIP-1 was amplified using the CKIP-1 forward primer and the CKIP-1 reverse primer. Primers were designed to create the number of CKIP-1 deletion mutants. CKIP-PH was constructed using the CKIP-1 forward primer and PH reverse primer (5′-GAA TTC GTC GAC TCA GGT GAT GGC AGA GTT GAG GGC A-3′), which incorporates a stop site after the PH domain; CKIP-LZ was constructed using the LZ forward primer (5′-TGA TCA GAA TTC CGG ATT CTG AGT CAG AGC AGC T-3′) with the CKIP-1 reverse primer; CKIP-ΔPH was constructed using the ΔPH forward primer (5′-TGA TCA GAA TTC CCC GAG CCA AGA ACC GTA TCT TGG-3′) with the CKIP-1 reverse primer; CKIP-ΔLZ was constructed using CKIP-1 forward primer with the ΔLZ reverse primer (5′-GAA TTC GTC GAC TCA AGA ATC CGG CGG AGA CCG AGG G-3′), which incorporated a stop codon immediately before the LZ; and finally, CKIP-ΔPHΔLZ was constructed using the ΔPH forward primer with the ΔLZ reverse primer. Each PCR product was gel-purified, ligated into pCR-Blunt, and digested with EcoRI, and the respective fragments were subcloned into EcoRI-digested pACT2 with the exception of CKIP-ΔPHΔLZ, which was digested from the pCR-Blunt construct with EcoRI/SalI and inserted into EcoRI/XhoI-digested pACT2. Constructs were verified for orientation using restriction digests and sequencing. pGEX Constructs—CKIP-1 deletion mutants (LZ, PH, and ΔPH, etc.) were constructed using the pCR-Blunt constructs described above (pACT2 section), by isolating the EcoRI/SalI insert fragments, and then subcloning them into EcoRI/SalI-digested pGEX-KG. Constructs were verified using restriction digest and protein expression. CKIP-1 PH domain mutants were digested from the pEGFP-C3 clones using EcoRI/SalI, and the resulting insert was subcloned into EcoRI/SalI-digested pGEX-KG vector and transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. The resulting constructs were designated as follows: pMO61 (W123A), pMO62 (K42C), pMO78 (R44C), pMO79 (K42C/R44C), pMO63 (K42C/W123A), pMO80 (R44C/W123A), and pMO64 (triple mutant). FLAG-tagged Constructs—Full-length CKIP-1 was amplified using a forward primer (5′-GAT AAG CTT GCC ACC ATG GAC TAC AAA GAC GAT GAC GAC AAG GAA TTC ATG ATG AAG AAG AAC-3′) to incorporate a HindIII site and a FLAG tag on its N terminus and a reverse primer (5′-GCC CGG AAT TAG CTT GGC TGC AGG TGC GGC CGC CGC TGC CCT CAC ATC-3′) that added a NotI site for subcloning. The amplified PCR product was gel-purified, ligated into pCR-Blunt, then digested using HindIII/NotI and subcloned into HindIII/NotI-digested pRC/CMV. To clone into FLAG-pRC/CMV, CKIP-1 PH domain mutants were amplified out of the pEGFP-C3 vector using FLAG-pRC/CMV forward, 5′-AGC TTC GAA TTC ATG ATG AAG AAG AAC AAT TCC-3′, and FLAG-pRC/CMV reverse, 5′-CGC GGT ACC GTG CGG CCG CCG CTG CCC TCA CAT C-3′, primers and ligated into pCR-Blunt, before subcloning into EcoRI/NotI-digested FLAG-pRC/CMV vector. The sequence of each clone, pMO41 (K42C), pMO58 (R44C), pMO40 (W123A), pMO60 (KR), pMO42 (KW), pMO59 (RW), and pMO43 (triple mutant), was confirmed by sequencing. Myristoylation Signal Constructs—A myristoylation sequence from v-Src (41Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Kaloudis P. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Hanafusa H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7033-7038PubMed Google Scholar), MGSSKSKPKDPSQR, was used to replace the PH domain at the N-terminal of CKIP-1 using the following myristoylation primer, 5′-AAG GAA TTC ATG GGT AGC AGC AAG AGC AAG CCC AAG GAT CCC AGC CAG CGG CGA GCC AAG AAC CGT ATC TTG GAT GAG GTC AC-3′. To subclone myristoylated CKIP-1 into FLAG-pRC/CMV, EGFP-CKIP-1 was used as a template for PCR using the myristoylation primer and FLAG-pRC/CMV reverse primer. The PCR product was gel-purified, ligated into pCR Blunt, digested with EcoRI/NotI, ligated into EcoRI/NotI-digested FLAG-pRC/CMV vector and sequence verified, resulting in clone pMO47. Similarly, a construct lacking the FLAG tag on the N-terminal was made by digesting a pCR Blunt clone with HindIII/ApaI, and then subcloning into HindIII/ApaI-digested pRC/CMV. The resulting clone, pMO48, was verified by sequencing. pGBT9 Constructs—Full-length cDNAs encoding CK2α or CK2α′ were previously subcloned into the BamHI site of the pGBT9 vector, and orientation was sequence-verified (37Bosc D.G. Graham K.C. Saulnier R.B. Zhang C. Prober D. Gietz R.D. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14295-14306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To prepare constructs incorporating mutations in a putative HIKE domain, full-length CK2α and CK2α′ were amplified from the pGBT9 vector by PCR using the pGBT9 forward primer, 5′-CTA GAA AGA CTG GAA CAG CTA TTT-3′, with the CK2α (5′-CTT TCT GTG CTG ATG ATC AAT CAT GAC-3′) or CK2α′ (5′-CTT TTT CTG TTC GTG ATC TAT CAT GAC-3′) HIKE mutation reverse primers, and using the CK2α (5′-GTC ATG ATT GAT CAT CAG CAC AGA AAG CTA-3′) or CK2α′ (5′-GTC ATG ATA GAT CAC GAA CAG AAA AAG CTG-3′) with pGBT9 reverse primer, 5′-AAA TCA TAA ATC ATA AGA AAT TCG CCC GGA-3′. Following amplification, the PCR products were added to a second PCR reaction along with the pGBT9 forward and reverse primers. The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and subcloned into BamHI-digested pGBT9, generating constructs designated pGBT9-CK2α-E167Q and pGBT9-CK2α′-Q168E, which were verified by sequencing. U2-OS and Saos-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were grown to 80% confluence, harvested using Trypsin-EDTA, and counted using a hemocytometer. For visualization studies, cells were seeded the day before transfection at ∼1.6 × 105 cells into 6-well, flat bottom tissue culture plates containing coverslips. The following day, 2-5 h prior to transfection, the medium was changed. Transfections were carried out using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer. Plasmids encoding the various constructs were added at a concentration of 1 μg per 35-× 20-mm well of a 6-well plate, or in the case of co-transfections, 0.5 μg of each construct was used. For pull-down experiments, U2-OS cells were seeded at 2.7 × 106 cells per 150-mm plate and transfected by calcium phosphate transfection. Precipitates were left on the cells for 16-18 h following transfection, after which the precipitates were washed off using PBS, pH 7.4. Medium was replaced, and the cells were allowed to grow another 24 h. After the 24 h, cells were washed well with PBS, and cell extracts were prepared by scraping cells from plates into interaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml para-methylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by sonication on ice (3 × 10-s bursts). The resulting lysates were ultracentrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and used immediately for GST pull-down assays or alternatively stored at -80 °C. To examine the co-localization of CK2α with CKIP-1, transfected U2-OS or Saos-2 cells were washed twice with PBS, then fixed for 30 min at 37 °C using 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and finally washed in PBS and mounted using AirVol. Where indicated, a 10-min incubation using digitonin in PBS at a concentration of 25 μg/ml was performed before fixation for some slides. To visualize FLAG-CKIP-1 and Myr-CKIP localization, Saos-2 cells were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using anti-CKIP-1 antibodies and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and were then fixed for 30 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS prior to saturation of the cells for 30 min with 0.1 m glycine and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-CKIP-1 antibodies (1/250 dilution), washed for 3 × 5 min with PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1/1000 dilution). Finally coverslips were washed well with PBS, and mounted in AirVol. For non-confocal images, EYFP and ECFP fluorescence was visualized using an Axiovert inverted fluorescence microscope fitted with a YFP/CFP filter set. The images were pseudocolored using Adobe Photoshop. For confocal images, EGFP, EYFP, and rhodamine fluorescence were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 410 or Zeiss LSM 510 Meta inverted confocal microscope. The images were pseudocolored using built-in Zeiss LSM software, and transferred into Adobe Photoshop. In all cases, controls were used to ensure that the settings used for microscopy eliminated bleed-through between channels. pGBT9-CK2 and pACT2-CKIP-1 constructs (including mutants of CK2 and CKIP-1) were transformed into the yeast strain PJ69-4a (MATa, ade2, trp1-901, leu 2-3, 112 his3-200, gal4, gal80, ura3-52, GAL7-lacZ::met1, GAL2-ADE2::ADE2, GAL1-HIS3::LYS2 (courtesy of Dr. Philip James, University of Wisconsin) (42James P.

Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Transformations were plated on synthetic complete medium lacking Trp and Leu (Trp-Leu-) and on synthetic complete medium lacking His, Ade, Trp, and Leu (His-Ade-Leu-Trp-). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3-6 days. Growth on Trp-Leu-was used as a measure of transformation efficiency, whereas growth on His-Ade-Leu-Trp-was an indication of positive interactions between the pGBT9 and pACT2 constructs used in the transformation. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins encoding full-length CKIP-1, CKIP-1 deletion mutants (LZ, ΔPH, etc.), CK2α or GST itself were expressed in BL21(DE3) bacteria and purified using glutathioneagarose as described previously (31Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and left on the beads for use in GST pull-down"
https://openalex.org/W2023607853,"Recent biochemical examination has revealed the presence of at least 90 different lipoproteins in Escherichia coli. Among previously identified lipoproteins, only an outer membrane lipoprotein, NlpE, is known to induce expression of the degP gene upon its overproduction. The degP gene encodes a periplasmic protease, which is thought to be involved in the digestion of unfolded proteins, and is essential for growth at high temperatures. However, it is not completely clear why NlpE overproduction causes degP expression. Moreover, among newly confirmed lipoproteins, there may be others that also induce degP expression. Therefore, we overproduced each of the 90 lipoproteins and examined the level of degP expression as β-galactosidase activity by using a degP promoter-lacZ fusion. The extent of degP expression caused by NlpE overproduction was dependent on the mode of degP-lacZ fusion. On the other hand, new inner membrane lipoprotein YafY strongly induced degP expression irrespective of the mode of fusion even though the level of overproduced YafY was lower than that of NlpE. The induction of degP expression by YafY overproduction was dependent on the Cpx two-component system. Alteration of the lipoprotein-sorting signals of NlpE and YafY did not abolish the degP induction. However, a YafY derivative possessing the outer membrane signal remained on inner membranes. The non-lipidated derivative of NlpE did not induce degP expression, indicating that membrane anchoring is essential for degP induction. The amino acid sequences of YafY and YfjS, another inner membrane lipoprotein, are highly identical, but overproduction of the latter did not induce degP expression. Construction of various YafY-YfjS chimeric lipoproteins revealed that only a few residues located in the N- and C-terminal regions were important for the induction of DegP."
https://openalex.org/W1973172099,"We report the identification and characterization of a novel lipid kinase that phosphorylates multiple substrates. This enzyme, which we term MuLK for multi-substrate lipid kinase, does not belong to a previously described lipid kinase family. MuLK has orthologs in many organisms and is broadly expressed in human tissues. Although predicted to be a soluble protein, MuLK co-fractionates with membranes and localizes to an internal membrane compartment. Recombinant MuLK phosphorylates diacylglycerol, ceramide, and 1-acylglycerol but not sphingosine. Although its affinity for diacylglycerol and ceramide are similar, MuLK exhibits a higher Vmax toward diacylglycerol in vitro, consistent with it acting primarily as a diacylglycerol kinase. MuLK activity was inhibited by sphingosine and enhanced by cardiolipin. It was stimulated by calcium when magnesium concentrations were low and inhibited by calcium when magnesium concentrations were high. The effects of charged lipids and cations on MuLK activity in vitro suggest that its activity in vivo is tightly regulated by cellular conditions.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), ceramide (7Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and sphingosine (8Liu H. Chakravarty D. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 493-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) constitute three different families of enzymes, each of which demonstrates substrate selectivity. In contrast, Escherichia coli expresses a lipid kinase that phosphorylates all three substrates (9Schneider E.G. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3739-3741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although animal cell lipid kinases are specific and clearly belong to distinct families based on their amino acid sequences, they share a similar catalytic domain that was first identified in DG kinase α (10Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and is therefore known as a DG kinase domain. Sequencing of the human and mouse genomes has revealed multiple putative lipid kinases, several of which contain a DG kinase domain. In an attempt to identify cDNAs encoding a calcium-activated ceramide kinase that co-purifies with neurotransmitter-containing (synaptic) vesicles (11Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T.F. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we searched sequence databases for orphan lipid kinases that might encode a ceramide kinase. We report here the characterization of a lipid kinase that phosphorylates ceramide but also demonstrates significant activity toward DG and monoacylglycerol. This enzyme, which we term MuLK for multi-substrate lipid kinase, is a novel lipid kinase. Materials—Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Fermentas (Hanover, MD). The cloning vector pFLAG-CTC, the anti-FLAG agarose affinity gel, the 3X-FLAG peptide, and the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody were obtained from Sigma. Primers were purchased from Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Expressed sequence tag clones of human (BE889885) and mouse (AW321722) MuLK and mouse CERK (6400872) were obtained from ResGen (Invitrogen). The normalized human cDNA library used for expression analysis and the pIRES-EGFP vector were purchased from BD Biosciences (Clontech). Ceramide (bovine brain), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, sn-1-monooleoylglycerol, tetraoleoylcardiolipin, and sphingosine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. 1-Arachidonylglycerol (1-AG) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company. Expressed sequence tag clones of human MuLK (BE889885), mouse MuLK (AW321722), and CERK (6400872) were obtained from ResGen (Invitrogen). LipofectAMINE was from Invitrogen. The monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (B-2) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The chemiluminescent detection reagent was DuraWest from Pierce. Fluoromount G and 16% paraformaldehyde were from Electron Microscopy Sciences. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Triton X-100, β-octylglucoside, aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and Complete-Mini protease inhibitors (without EGTA) were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Recombinant E. coli DG kinase, Hoechst stain, and other reagents were from Sigma. Genome Search for Potential Ceramide Kinases—The human sphingosine kinase, sphingosine kinase 2, was used as a query sequence in a TBLASTN search of the human genome data base. Ten hits with expect values of 7 × 10–8 or less were obtained. As anticipated, the highest scoring hits represented the known mammalian sphingosine kinase genes as well as related DG kinase genes. However, the search also revealed a gene with a region that is 44% homologous to human sphingosine kinase 2 (hSPK2). The region of highest homology corresponded to a potential kinase catalytic domain that is present in both sphingosine and DG kinases. This highest scoring sequence was used in a BLASTP search of the non-redundant protein data base, which revealed three unpublished entries. One entry was identified as a putative lipid kinase but did not describe any functional data. The full-length protein sequence of the putative lipid kinase was then used to re-query the human genome data base, and three homologous sequences were identified. Sequence Comparisons and Domain Predictions—The sequences of MuLK, CERK, sphingosine, and DG kinases were aligned using ClustalW with the BLOSUM protein weight matrix. A phylogenetic tree was constructed, and genetic distances were calculated (percent divergence) using the neighbor-joining method of Saitou and Nei (12Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences included were Homo sapiens MuLK (CAB93536), Mus musculus MuLK (CAC06108), H. sapiens sphingosine kinase 1 (Q9NYA1), M. musculus sphingosine kinase 1 (AAH37710), H. sapiens sphingosine kinase 2 (Q9NRAO), M. musculus sphingosine kinase 2 (Q9JIA7), H. sapiens ceramide kinase (BAC01154), M. musculus ceramide kinase (NP_663450), H. sapiens DG kinases α (AAH223523), δ (Q16760), ∈ (P52429), θ (NP_001338), and ξ (Q13574), and E. coli DG Kinase (P00556). Gene products of putative MuLKs from Xenopus laevis (AAH43761) and Danio rerio (AAH45347) were identified using a BLASTP search and compared with human and mouse MuLK sequences using ClustalW. ClustalW identifies conservative changes by dividing amino acid residues into five groups as follows: (i) small and hydrophobic; (ii) acidic; (iii) basic; (iv) hydroxyl amine and basic; and (v) others (www.ebi.ac.uk.clustalw/). Phosphorylation consensus sites and protein motifs across species were predicted using SwissProt-Prosite. MuLK-EGFP Expression and Subcellular Fractionation—A carboxyl-terminal fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to MuLK (MuLK-EGFP) was generated by ligating an EGFP PCR product into a plasmid already containing MuLK. To create the carboxyl-terminal fusion of EGFP to CERK, CERK was amplified using PCR from IMAGE clone 6400872 (Invitrogen) and inserted into the pMuLK-EGFP construct, replacing MuLK. To evaluate cellular localization, a 60-cm plate of 80% confluent human embryonic kidney 293T cells was transfected with 1.6 μg of DNA of each construct (pIRES-EGFP, pMuLK-EGFP, and pCERK-EGFP) using LipofectAMINE 2000. A transfection efficiency of 60–70% was determined by fluorescent microscopy. After 48 h, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then lysed by sonication. Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifuging at 2000 × g for 5 min. Soluble and insoluble fractions of the cleared lysate were then generated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Equal volumes of these samples were separated on a 12.5% Tris-glycine gel under reducing and denaturing conditions and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Blots were probed with monoclonal anti-GFP (B-2) antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and detected using the Pierce DuraWest enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. To visualize MuLK-EGFP expression in situ, transfected cells were fixed 48 h after transfection (4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min), washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1 m glycine, incubated with Hoechst dye to label nuclei, and attached to coverslips using Fluoromount G as a mounting medium. EGFP fluorescence was visualized using an Applied Precision Deltavision microscope, and images were captured using Softworx software. mRNA Expression Analysis—To determine the expression levels of MuLK in various human tissues, a 528-base pair product encompassing the 3′-end of the coding sequence and 119 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated region of human MuLK was amplified from a BD Biosciences normalized cDNA panel. Reactions were conducted according to the manufacturer's directions. Two 29-base pair primers, 5′-GGCACAACCACAGGATGCCCTTTCCCAAG-3′ and 5′-TGCCATGAAAATGCCCTGGGGACCCTCTG-3′, were used. MuLK reactions were incubated at 94 °C for 30s followed by 28 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 2 min. As a control for template loading, a portion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was also amplified using manufacturer-supplied primers and cycle parameters. The relative amounts of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase product generated from each tissue were similar to the levels reported by the manufacturer. PCR products were separated in a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Product band net intensity was quantified on a Kodak Image Station 440CF. Expression of Carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged MuLK—A carboxylterminal FLAG-epitope-tagged mouse MuLK (MuLK-FLAG) was created by inserting MuLK into pFLAG-CTC. This construct was expressed in BL21, a protease-deficient strain of E. coli. To generate protein, cultures of transformed bacteria were grown under selection overnight, diluted 10-fold, and then grown to an A600 of 2, at which point protein expression was induced by adding 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. After induction, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, containing 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (1 pellet per 10 ml of buffer) and probe-sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was incubated for 1–14 h with anti-FLAG IgG-coated agarose resin at 4 °C with continual turning. MuLK was eluted with 3–5 column volumes of MOPS buffer (see above) containing 0.1 mg/ml 3X-FLAG. This produced a preparation enriched in MuLK. An unrelated pFLAG-CTC fusion protein, which served as a negative control, was generated and purified using an identical procedure. Glycerol or ethylene glycol and dithiothreitol were added to the eluate to a final concentration of 20% (v/v) and 1 mm, respectively. For kinetic assays, the recombinant protein was stored at 4 °C and used within a week. Expression and purification of a 47-kDa protein was confirmed by Western analysis using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Expression levels of MuLK in E. coli varied between preparations, and protein yields were generally low. Lipid Kinase Activity Assay—The activity of purified, recombinant mouse MuLK was assayed in β-octylglucoside as described previously (13Bajjalieh S.M. Batchelor R.H. Methods in Enzymology. 2000; 311: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or as follows. In a final volume of 100 μl, purified recombinant MuLK was combined with lipid-detergent mixed micelles containing the indicated substrate, detergent, and cardiolipin at one-tenth the concentration of the lipid substrate (unless stated otherwise). This mixture was buffered with 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 3 mm total CaCl2 (2 mm free calcium, unless indicated). The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP/MgCl2 (1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) and 5 mm MgCl2 in the final assay). The assay was incubated with constant agitation at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1). After brief vortexing, 350 μl of 2 m KCl and 2 mm H3PO4 was added to generate two phases. The two phases were separated after vigorous mixing, the lower (organic) phase was removed to a second tube, the volume was reduced under a stream of nitrogen gas, and the entire sample was analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Thin layer chromatography plates were developed for 80 min in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:15:5). Phosphorylated reaction products were identified by co-migration with standards generated using E. coli DG kinase and quantified by scraping and scintillation counting or by using STORM image analysis (Molecular Dynamics) and Imagequant software. An unrelated purified pFLAG-CTC fusion protein containing the first 163 amino acids of synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2AN) was assayed as a control for contamination by endogenous E. coli lipid kinases. Under these conditions, all reactions were linear with time, proportional to the added enzyme, and substrate conversion was <2%. Calcium concentrations were calculated using the MaxChelator Program (www.stanford.edu.∼cpatton/webmaxcS.htm). Kinetic parameters were calculated using Prism Graph Pad software. Identification of Two Novel Lipid Kinases by Homology Search—Based on the hypothesis that ceramide kinases would share structural and functional domains with sphingosine kinase, we performed a data base search using one of the human sphingosine kinases, sphingosine kinase 2, as a query sequence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This search revealed a gene that contained both a region that is 44% homologous to SPK2 and a potential lipid kinase catalytic domain that is present in sphingosine and DG kinases (6Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The predicted full-length protein encoded by this gene was obtained from a BLASTP search. As described below, we have named this protein MuLK. The sequence of MuLK was then used to re-query the human genome data base. Three additional gene sequences were identified. All three are distantly related to sphingosine and DG kinases, with sequence homologies of 10–22%. One of these was recently described by Sugiura et al. as a ceramide-specific kinase that they have termed CERK (7Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The other two share 68–87% amino acid sequence identity with MuLK. These three proteins therefore appeared to constitute a gene family. A BLASTP search using human MuLK as a query sequence revealed a mouse homolog as well as putative homologs in multiple organisms. The Sequence of MuLK—Fig. 1 shows the sequence of mouse MuLK. The most notable feature of the protein is a DG kinase domain near the amino terminus. MuLK also contains a putative nuclear localization sequence that overlaps the amino-terminal portion of the catalytic domain. The nuclear localization domain is found in all MuLK orthologs except Caenorhabditis elegans. It is also found in type IV and type V DG kinases (ξ, ι, and θ) (15van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and has been shown to mediate the nuclear localization of DG kinase ξ (16Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This nuclear localization sequence occurs with high frequency in the protein data base, however, so it remains to be determined whether it regulates the subcellular localization of MuLK. A comparison of putative MuLKs across selected vertebrate species revealed that the amino acid sequence identity is well conserved among vertebrate MuLK proteins, especially within the amino-terminal region that includes the DG kinase catalytic domain (Fig. 1). Additional MuLK orthologs were identified in Drosophila melanogaster (AAF52895) and C. elegans (T16422), Arabidopsis thaliana (AAM91597), and Oryza sativa (BAC65388), indicating that MuLK-like proteins are expressed in most eukaryotes. There was no MuLK-related protein sequence in S. cerevisiae however, suggesting that, like DG and ceramide kinases, MuLK is expressed only in higher eukaryotes. The human MuLK gene is located on chromosome 7q34 and contains 15 exons. The mouse gene is located on chromosome 6B1 and also contains 15 exons. The other two human MuLK genes found in our original query are on the X chromosome (Xq26) and the Y chromosome (4q11.2). These genes lack many of the introns present in the chromosome 7 MuLK gene and are riddled with nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations, suggesting that they are non-functional retroposons. Similarly, the mouse genome has an intronless MuLK sequence on chromosome 13C3 that has two frameshift mutations. Several protein kinase substrate consensus sites in MuLK were identified using SwissProt-Prosite. Mouse MuLK contains nine casein kinase II sites, seven protein kinase C sites, and two protein kinase A sites. These sites are conserved between human and mouse but are not present in MuLK orthologs from zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, Arabidopsis, and rice. It is not known if any are bona fide phosphorylation sites, although the regulation of lipid kinases by protein kinase C isoforms reported for DG kinase types I (17Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. Imaizumi T. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), IV (16Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and V (15van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and for sphingosine kinase I (18Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) suggests that MuLK may be also regulated by phosphorylation. To determine whether MuLK is a member of a previously identified lipid kinase family, we compared MuLK sequences to those of other lipid kinases. Fig. 2 shows a phylogram comparison of MuLK to DG, ceramide, and sphingosine kinases. Bootstrap analysis of the aligned sequences revealed that human and mouse MuLK segregated to a unique branch. This indicates that MuLK is a distinct lipid kinase that is not a member of a previously described family. MuLK Is a Ubiquitously Expressed, Membrane-associated Protein—Analysis of the amino acid sequence of MuLK predicts no signal sequence, transmembrane domains, or lipid modifications. This suggests that MuLK is a cytosolic, soluble protein. To test this possibility, we expressed MuLK fused to EGFP in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and compared the proportion of MuLK in the cytosolic and membrane fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As a control for the effects of EGFP on protein localization, we also analyzed the localization of mouse CERK-EGFP, because untagged CERK was shown previously to be largely membrane-associated (7Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Western analyses of cytosolic and membrane fractions revealed that the majority of MuLK was found in the particulate fraction (100,000 × g pellet), a distribution similar to that of CERK. EGFP, expressed alone, was largely cytosolic (Fig. 3A). When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, a fibroblast cell line, MuLK-EGFP localized to an internal membrane compartment (Fig. 3B). This result indicates that in unstimulated fibroblasts the enzyme is associated with endomembranes rather than being cytoplasmic or nuclear as suggested by its sequence. To determine the tissue distribution of MuLK, we surveyed RNA expression levels by the amplification of normalized cDNA pools from various tissues as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4 shows that MuLK was expressed in all tissues surveyed. Expression was highest in neuroendocrine organs such as pancreas and brain and relatively lowest in skeletal muscle, kidney, and lung. MuLK Is a Multi-substrate Lipid Kinase—To determine whether MuLK is a bona fide lipid kinase and test its substrate specificity, we analyzed the ability of recombinant MuLK to phosphorylate various lipids in vitro using an assay in which substrates were presented in detergent-lipid mixed micelles. Purified recombinant MuLK-FLAG phosphorylated 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol as well as monoacylglycerol. It also demonstrated significant activity toward ceramide but not sphingosine (Fig. 5A). This result indicates that MuLK can phosphorylate a number of neutral lipid species but does exhibit some substrate selectivity. We have indirect evidence that MuLK does not phosphorylate soluble polyols, because up to 20% (v/v) glycerol or ethylene glycol had no effect on its ceramide kinase activity (not shown). MuLK phosphorylated sn-1-oleoylglycerol and 1-AG to a similar extent. It showed little activity toward 2-AG when the assay was conducted using Triton X-100 mixed micelles (Fig. 4A). However, when kinase selectivity was assessed using β-octylglucoside mixed micelles, a greater relative activity toward 2-AG was detected (not shown). Despite these observations, we cannot be certain that 2-AG is a bona fide substrate, because preparations of 2-AG readily isomerize to 1-AG (19Stella N. Schweitzer P. Piomelli D. Nature. 1997; 388: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). To confirm that the activity measured was not due to contaminating E. coli DG kinase, an unrelated recombinant protein, SV2AN, purified in the same way as recombinant MuLK-FLAG, was assayed for lipid kinase activity. It exhibited minimal activity, indicating that MuLK was responsible for the majority of the kinase activity measured (not shown). MuLK DG kinase activity was inhibited 86–94% by the presence of 40-fold higher concentrations of alternate substrates (Fig. 5B). Assuming only one active site on MuLK, together with the finding that MuLK phosphorylates ceramide, monoacylglycerol, and diacylglycerol, this inhibition suggests that the substrates of MuLK act as competitive inhibitors of one another. Interestingly, sphingosine also inhibited DG kinase activity (Fig. 5B), even though it was not a substrate for the enzyme. Both ceramide and DG kinase activities were inhibited by sphingosine in a dose-dependent manner (not shown). MuLK Demonstrates Similar Affinities for Ceramide and DG but a Higher Vmax toward DG—To analyze further the substrate specificity of MuLK, we measured the apparent Km and Vmax toward ceramide and DG in two different detergent-based assays. Using the β-octylglucoside-based assay used previously to assay ceramide kinase activity (13Bajjalieh S.M. Batchelor R.H. Methods in Enzymology. 2000; 311: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we found a trend toward a slightly lower Km for ceramide and a consistently higher Vmax for DG (not shown). In a Triton X-100-based assay, the apparent Km for ceramide (34 μm) was again slightly lower but similar to that for DG (45 μm), suggesting that the enzyme binds both lipids with roughly equal affinity. Similar Km values were determined for dipalmitoylglycerol in TX-100 (not shown), suggesting that acyl chain length does not have significant effects on substrate affinity. In this assay the Vmax for dioleoylglycerol (159 nmol/min/mg) was 4–5 times the rate measured for ceramide (37 nmol/min/mg) (Fig. 6A). We also performed assays in which we varied the mol % of the substrate in Triton X-100 micelles. Data derived in this manner can be compared with a surface dilution kinetic model (20Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We found that ceramide kinase activity conformed to such a model, yielding a Km of 3.78 mol % and a Vmax of 68 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 6B). By contrast, the Km for dioleoylglycerol was independent of the surface concentrations tested, suggesting that it was too low to measure (Fig. 6C). These results were not an aberration of the assay system, because surface dilution kinetic parameters for a DG kinase activity from T cells has been determined using similar conditions. 2D. Waggoner, unpublished observations. These results highlight the sensitivity of MuLK to substrate presentation and suggest that the affinities and kinetics measured in vitro using recombinant enzyme may differ from those of the enzyme in vivo. MuLK Activity Is Modulated by Surface Charge and the Ionic Environment—Kinases require a counter ion for ATP, typically Mg2. In some cases kinase activity is also modulated by those same ions directly. DG kinases from E. coli (21Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pig brain (22Kanoh H. Kondoh H. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are both stimulated by magnesium in excess of ATP concentrations. We examined the Mg2+ requirement for the DG and ceramide kinase activities of MuLK and found that it stimulated MuLK kinase activity maximally when included at a 5–10 molar excess over ATP (not shown). All reported endogenous ceramide kinase activities, as well as the recently identified ceramide-specific kinase, CERK, are stimulated by Ca2+ (7Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To determine whether MuLK is regulated by Ca2+, we compared MuLK activity in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (which buffers Ca2+at ∼10–9m) to its activity in the presence of 1 mm free Ca2+. We found that the effects of Ca2+ varied with the concentrations of Mg2+ in the assay (Fig. 7). At low Mg2+/ATP ratios (0.5:1), Ca2+ stimulated the phosphorylation of both DG and ceramide 2–9-fold. By contrast, when Mg2+ was in excess (5:1 Mg/ATP), Ca2+"
https://openalex.org/W2010213901,"Autosomal dominant and recessive distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) can be caused by mutations in the anion exchanger 1 (AE1 or SLC4A1) gene, which encodes the erythroid chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger membrane glycoprotein (eAE1) and a truncated kidney isoform (kAE1). The biosynthesis and trafficking of kAE1 containing a novel recessive missense dRTA mutation (kAE1 S773P) was studied in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, expressing the mutant alone or in combination with wild-type kAE1 or another recessive mutant, kAE1 G701D. The kAE1 S773P mutant was expressed at a three times lower level than wild-type, had a 2-fold decrease in its half-life, and was targeted for degradation by the proteasome. It could not be detected at the plasma membrane in human embryonic kidney cells and showed predominant endoplasmic reticulum immunolocalization in both human embryonic kidney and LLC-PK1 cells. The oligosaccharide on a kAE1 S773P N-glycosylation mutant (N555) was not processed to the complex form indicating impaired exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. The kAE1 S773P mutant showed decreased binding to an inhibitor affinity resin and increased sensitivity to proteases, suggesting that it was not properly folded. The other recessive dRTA mutant, kAE1 G701D, also exhibited defective trafficking to the plasma membrane. The recessive kAE1 mutants formed dimers like wild-type AE1 and could hetero-oligomerize with wild-type kAE1 or with each other. Hetero-oligomers of wild-type kAE1 with recessive kAE1 S773P or G701D, in contrast to the dominant kAE1 R589H mutant, were delivered to the plasma membrane. Autosomal dominant and recessive distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) can be caused by mutations in the anion exchanger 1 (AE1 or SLC4A1) gene, which encodes the erythroid chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger membrane glycoprotein (eAE1) and a truncated kidney isoform (kAE1).

The oligosaccharide on a kAE1 S773P N-glycosylation mutant (N555) was not processed to the complex form indicating impaired exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. The kAE1 S773P mutant showed decreased binding to an inhibitor affinity resin and increased sensitivity to proteases, suggesting that it was not properly folded. The other recessive dRTA mutant, kAE1 G701D, also exhibited defective trafficking to the plasma membrane. The recessive kAE1 mutants formed dimers like wild-type AE1 and could hetero-oligomerize with wild-type kAE1 or with each other. Hetero-oligomers of wild-type kAE1 with recessive kAE1 S773P or G701D, in contrast to the dominant kAE1 R589H mutant, were delivered to the plasma membrane. The kidney plays an essential role in maintaining the acid-base balance of the body by reabsorbing bicarbonate in the proximal tubule and secreting acid into the urine. Impairment in acid secretion by α-intercalated cells of the distal nephron leads to the development of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), 1The abbreviations used are: dRTA, distal renal tubular acidosis; AD dRTA, autosomal dominant distal renal tubular acidosis; AE, anion exchanger; AR dRTA, autosomal recessive dRTA; C12E8, octaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether; endo H, endoglycosidase H; GPA, glycophorin A; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; H2DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-2,2′-dihydrostilbene disulfonate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; kAE1, kidney isoform of anion exchanger 1; kAE1 His, kAE1 with C-terminal His6 tag; LLC-PK1 cell, porcine kidney epithelial cells; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PFO, perfluoro-octanoic acid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; SITS, 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SAO, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: dRTA, distal renal tubular acidosis; AD dRTA, autosomal dominant distal renal tubular acidosis; AE, anion exchanger; AR dRTA, autosomal recessive dRTA; C12E8, octaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether; endo H, endoglycosidase H; GPA, glycophorin A; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; H2DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-2,2′-dihydrostilbene disulfonate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; kAE1, kidney isoform of anion exchanger 1; kAE1 His, kAE1 with C-terminal His6 tag; LLC-PK1 cell, porcine kidney epithelial cells; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PFO, perfluoro-octanoic acid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; SITS, 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SAO, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type. which is inherited in both an autosomal dominant (AD dRTA) (1Karet F.E.

Taken together, these studies show that dominant AE1 dRTA mutants are functional, impaired in their exit from the ER, and are mislocalized to the apical membrane in polarized cells. The dominant phenotype is because of hetero-oligomer formation and intracellular retention of the wild-type protein.

AE1 G701D could not reach the cell surface in Xenopus oocytes but was rescued when coexpressed with glycophorin A (GPA) (8Tanphaichitr V.S. Sumboonnanonda A. Ideguchi H. Shayakul C. Brugnara C. Takao M. Veerakul G. Alper S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 2173-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). GPA is a type I single-span membrane glycoprotein found in the erythrocyte membrane. It associates with AE1 during biosynthesis and promotes AE1 trafficking to the plasma membrane (30Young M.T. Beckmann R. Toye A.M. Tanner M.J. Biochem.

Therefore, AE1 G701D may fold and traffic normally in the presence of GPA in the red cell precursors but not in kidney cells that lack GPA (31Alper S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 899-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two AE1 mutations, A858D and ΔV850, in compound heterozygosity with SAO (A858D/SAO or ΔV850/SAO) or each other (A858D/ΔV850) were also found to cause recessive dRTA (4Bruce L.J. Wrong O.

J. 2000; 350: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The AE1 A858D mutant had low Cl- uptake activity in Xenopus oocytes but had greatly decreased transport activity when coexpressed with AE1 SAO or AE1 ΔV850. Transport function could only be partially rescued by GPA (4Bruce L.J. Wrong O. Toye A.M. Young M.T. Ogle G. Ismail Z. Sinha A.K. McMaster P. Hwaihwanje I. Nash G.B. Hart S. Lavu E. Palmer R.

Similarly, when AE1 ΔV850 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes by itself or with AE1 SAO, chloride uptake was markedly decreased and was incompletely rescued by GPA (4Bruce L.J. Wrong O. Toye A.M.

In this paper we characterized a novel missense AR dRTA mutation in kAE1 resulting in a change of serine at position 773 to proline (S773P), found in a family in the Northeast Thailand. The subject is a compound heterozygote for S773P and G701D and has dRTA as well as rickets and bilateral nephrocalcinosis but does not have hearing loss or anemia. Parents are asymptomatic and normal in acid loading tests. After PCR single-stranded conformation polymorphism screening and sequencing for SLC4A1 mutation, the G701D mutant was reported in the mother, whereas the novel S773P mutant was found in the father (32Sritippayawan S.

In order to understand the molecular basis of dRTA caused by this mutation, we generated the kAE1 S773P mutant and analyzed its biosynthesis and trafficking in transfected HEK and LLC-PK1 cells either alone to mimic the homozygous state, in combination with wild-type kAE1 to mimic the parental state, or with the recessive G701D mutant to mimic the heterozygous state found in the subject.

The kidney isoform of Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (kAE1 SAO) was a generous gift from Joanne Cheung (University of Toronto). Both kAE1 S773P and kAE1 S773P tagged at their C termini with His6 were generated using the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotide primers from ACGT Corp. (Toronto, Canada). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing performed by ACGT Corp. (Toronto, Canada). Plasmid DNA for transfections was purified with Qiagen (Valencia, CA) Plasmid Midi columns. Cell Culture—HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.5% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The day before transfection the cells were trypsinized and replated in either 6-well or 35-mm2 plates. Either DEAE-dextran method (34Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transiently transfect the cells (1 μg of DNA per well of a 6-well dish). LLC-PK1 cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 with 10% calf serum and 0.5% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected as described above. Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were used to analyze protein samples (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This antibody does not recognize the C-terminal tail of His6-tagged kAE1 protein, which could be detected by a rabbit antiserum raised against the 15 N-terminal residues of kAE1 (anti-Nt kAE1). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) was then used to probe for the primary antibody. 1:5000 dilution of mouse anti-GAPDH (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used to detect the level of endogenous GAPDH expression in HEK cells. BM Chemiluminescence Blotting Substrate (Roche Applied Science) and exposure to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) were used to detect AE1 protein bands. Densitometric analysis to determine the relative amounts of AE1 was performed by using NIH Image 1.62 software (National Institutes of Health). Pulse-Chase Assay—The day after transfection, cells (∼60–80% confluent, in 35-mm2 dishes as described previously) were starved in methionine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min and pulsed with 100 μCi/ml of l-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min to label newly synthesized protein. After labeling, the medium was removed and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.5% penicillin and streptomycin. In some cases, the proteasome inhibitor, MG262 (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) (1 μm), was added to the cells for 30 min before pulsing. At each chase time point, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors: 100 μm PMSF (Sigma), 1 μm aprotinin (Roche Applied Science), 1 μm leupeptin (Roche Applied Science), 1 μm pepstatin (Roche Applied Science). The wild-type and mutant kAE1 were immunoprecipitated with 4 μl of anti-Ct AE1 antibody at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of RIPA buffer, and proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 2× sample buffer. The radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis using 8% SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to film. The relative amounts of kAE1 were determined using NIH Image 1.62 software as mentioned above. Processing of the N-linked oligosaccharide was determined using kAE1 N555 construct (33Li J. Quilty J. Popov M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation using anti-Ct AE1 antibody, the high mannose and complex oligosaccharides were distinguished by endo H digestion (33Li J. Quilty J. Popov M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cell Surface Biotinylation—The cells were washed with borate buffer (10 mm boric acid, 154 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 9.0) and treated twice with 1 ml of 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in borate buffer for 15 min at room temperature (36Yip J.W.

Unreacted reagent was then quenched by rinsing the cells with 0.192 m glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors, and an aliquot of the lysate was taken for Western blotting. ImmunoPure (Pierce) immobilized streptavidin (100 μl) was added to the lysate for 1 h at 4 °C to bind the biotinylated proteins. The supernatant was removed, and an aliquot (unbound fraction) was taken for Western blotting. The streptavidin beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer. SDS sample buffer (containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the beads (bound fraction), and the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature to cleave the disulfide bond in the biotinylating reagent and release the captured proteins. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the anti-Ct AE1 antibody. The blot was also incubated with mouse anti-tubulin antibody to confirm that biotinylation was solely restricted to the cell surface. Immunofluorescence—HEK and LLC-PK1 were grown on glass coverslips. The transiently transfected HEK or LLC-PK1 cells were rinsed twice in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. The cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with 100 mm glycine, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After blocking nonspecific binding with 1% BSA, the cells were incubated either with a 1:1,000 dilution of a rabbit anti-Ct AE1 antibody or with a 1:1,000 dilution of a mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance Inc, Princeton, NJ) in PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. After several washes, the coverslips were incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (1:1,000) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted before observation using a laser scanning confocal Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. SITS-Affi-Gel Binding Assay—Transfected cells were lysed in 500 μl of PBS containing 1% C12E8 (Nikkol, Tokyo, Japan) and protease inhibitors (PMSF, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin) at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged (13,000 × g) to remove insoluble material. 25 μl of SITS-Affi-Gel 102 prepared as described previously (37Pimplikar S.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9770-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 100 μl of lysate were combined in 1% C12E8, 253 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.1, w"

The extracytoplasmic region of the CI-MPR contains 15 contiguous domains, and the two high affinity (∼1 nm) Man-6-P-binding sites have been mapped to domains 1–3 and 9, with essential residues localized to domains 3 and 9. Domain 5 of the CI-MPR exhibits significant sequence homology to domains 3 and 9 as well as to the CD-MPR. A structure-based sequence alignment was performed that predicts that domain 5 contains the four conserved key residues (Gln, Arg, Glu, and Tyr) identified as essential for carbohydrate recognition by the CD-MPR and domains 3 and 9 of the CI-MPR, but lacks two cysteine residues predicted to form a disulfide bond within the binding pocket. To determine whether domain 5 harbors a carbohydrate-binding site, a construct that encodes domain 5 alone (Dom5His) was expressed in Pichia pastoris. Microarray analysis using 30 different oligosaccharides demonstrated that Dom5His bound specifically to a Man-6-P-containing oligosaccharide (pentamannosyl 6-phosphate). Frontal affinity chromatography showed that the affinity of Dom5His for Man-6-P was ∼300-fold lower (Ki = 5.3 mm) than that observed for domains 1–3 and 9. The interaction affinity for the lysosomal enzyme β-glucuronidase was also much lower (Kd = 54 μm) as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the CI-MPR contains a third Man-6-P recognition site that is located in domain 5 and that exhibits lower affinity than the carbohydrate-binding sites present in domains 1–3 and 9.

The MPRs function in the intracellular routing of acid hydrolases that bear mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues on their N-linked oligosaccharide chains by delivering their cargo from the trans-Golgi network to endosomal compartments, thereby diverting these soluble enzymes from the secretory pathway (1Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Although both receptors exhibit similar trafficking itineraries, traveling between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane to carry out multiple rounds of protein transport, only the CI-MPR functions at the cell surface in the binding and internalization of exogenous ligands (2Stein M.

In addition to lysosomal enzymes, a number of other proteins have been identified that contain Man-6-P. This growing list of extracellular ligands includes granzymes A and B (4Griffiths G.M. Isaaz S.

Furthermore, several studies indicate that interaction with cell-surface CI-MPRs modulates the function and/or activity of these extracellular ligands, suggesting a role for the CI-MPR in various processes such as apoptosis, cell migration, cell growth, and viral entry (10Dahms N.M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) studies support the existence of the CD-MPR as a stable homodimer. The CI-MPR is also capable of forming oligomeric structures that are most likely dimers, and the binding of a lysosomal enzyme appears to stabilize the oligomeric state (14York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The CI-MPR contains a large extracellular region consisting of 15 tandemly repeating units with an average size of 147 amino acids. Sequence analysis of each of the 15 domains of the CI-MPR demonstrated significant amino acid identity to each other (16–38%) and to the ∼150-residue extracytoplasmic region of the CD-MPR (14–28%) (15Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the CD-MPR, which binds one molecule of Man-6-P/polypeptide (16Tong P.Y. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7970-7975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the CI-MPR contains two high affinity (nanomolar) Man-6-P-binding sites, which have been mapped to domains 1–3 and 9 (17Tong P.Y.

The CI-MPR, unlike the CD-MPR, also interacts with a number of non-Man-6-P-containing molecules that include insulin-like growth factor II, plasminogen, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, and retinoic acid. Insulin-like growth factor II binds to domain 11 of the CI-MPR, and sequences in domain 13 have been shown to enhance the binding affinity by ∼10-fold (22Devi G.R. Byrd J.C. Slentz D.H.

Plasminogen and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor bind to regions distinct from the Man-6-P- and insulin-like growth factor II-binding sites, and expression of truncated CI-MPR constructs has localized the plasminogen- and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-binding sites to the N-terminal half of domain 1 (25Leksa V. Godar S. Cebecauer M. Hilgert I. Breuss J. Weidle U.H. Horejsi V. Binder B.R. Stockinger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40575-40582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Limited information is available on the retinoic acid-binding site. Insulin-like growth factor II and Man-6-P do not inhibit retinoic acid binding, and studies indicate that the ∼40-kDa C-terminal region of the receptor is essential for this interaction (26Kang J.X. Li Y. Leaf A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13671-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although domains 1, 3, 9, 11, and 13 have been assigned ligand binding functions, the role (i.e. ligand binding and/or structural) the remaining domains play in receptor activity is not known. Previous sequence analyses of the 15 repeating domains of the CI-MPR by Lobel et al. (15Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led to the observation that the two high affinity Man-6-P-binding sites (i.e. domains 3 and 9) of the CI-MPR exhibit significant sequence homology to each other and to the extracytoplasmic region of the CD-MPR, suggesting that the conserved sequences may be indicative of their common function of phosphomannosyl recognition. Interestingly, this study also revealed that domain 5 exhibits a comparable level of sequence identity to the CD-MPR as observed for domains 3 and 9. Our crystal structures of the CD-MPR (13Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Olson L.J. Zhang J.

To evaluate the possibility that domain 5 binds carbohydrate, we performed a structure-based sequence alignment to compare domain 5 with the CD-MPR and domains 3 and 9 of the CI-MPR (see Fig. 1). The alignment reveals that domain 5 contains the four key residues (corresponding to Gln-66, Arg-111, Glu-133, and Tyr-143) that are conserved in the CD-MPR and in domains 3 and 9 of all CI-MPRs sequenced to date and that have been demonstrated to be essential for high affinity Man-6-P binding. However, this sequence alignment reveals that domain 5 lacks two cysteine residues that, based on the structures of the CD-MPR (13Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P.

Thus, it is unclear from the alignment analysis whether domain 5 harbors a Man-6-P-binding site. To directly demonstrate whether domain 5 of the CI-MPR contains a Man-6-P recognition site, a construct encoding domain 5 alone was generated and assayed for its ability to bind carbohydrate ligands. Although preliminary equilibrium binding studies using a lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, did not detect specific binding up to a ligand concentration of 250 nm, an oligosaccharide-based microarray (32Fukui S. Feizi T. Galustian C. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 33Feizi T. Chai W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) demonstrated that domain 5 specifically interacts with pentamannosyl 6-phosphate. This critical observation led us to further probe the carbohydrate binding activity of this region of the CI-MPR by pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. Taken together, this study has identified a third Man-6-P recognition site in the CI-MPR that is localized to domain 5 and that exhibits a significantly lower affinity (∼300-fold) for Man-6-P compared with domains 1–3 and 9 of the receptor. Materials—The following materials and reagents were obtained commercially as indicated: Pichia pastoris wild-type strain X-33, P. pastoris expression vector pGAPZαA, Zeocin, and T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen); BioMix DNA polymerase (Bioline); restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs Inc.); GeneMate plasmid DNA minipreps (ISC BioExpress); Benchmark prestained and unstained protein markers (Invitrogen); endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) (Roche Applied Science); ω-aminoethyl-agarose, gel filtration standards, glucose 6-phosphate, Man-6-P, and mannose (Sigma); 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP), SwellGel bulk cobalt chelated discs, and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce); polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp.); 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Acros Organics); and carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphomannan from Hansenula holstii was a kind gift from Dr. M. E. Slodki (Northern Regional Research Center, Peoria, IL). MTX3.2 cells overexpressing human β-glucuronidase were generously provided by Dr. W. Sly (St. Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Generation of Truncated CI-MPR Constructs—The cDNA construct encoding extracytoplasmic domains 1–15 of the bovine CI-MPR was used as a template to generate a construct encoding domain 5 alone followed by a C-terminal His6 tag (Dom5His). Briefly, the sequences encoding domain 5 (residues 584–725) followed by six histidine residues (CAC) and a stop codon (TGA) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the P. pastoris expression vector pGAPZαA, which utilizes a constitutive promoter, in-frame with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor signal sequence. The Dom9His construct (residues 1184–1327 followed by a His6 tag) was subcloned into the pGAPZαA vector as described previously (19Hancock M.K. Yammani R.D. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47205-47212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing (Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Facility, Medical College of Wisconsin) confirmed the predicted sequences. Expression and Purification of Dom5His and Dom9His Constructs— The cDNA constructs were linearized with BspHI and transformed into P. pastoris by electroporation, and Zeocin-resistant transformants were selected as described previously (34Reddy S.T. Dahms N.M. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 26: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Positive clones were inoculated in liquid medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose, and cultures were harvested after 5 days of growth at 30 °C. Following removal of the cells by centrifugation, the medium was dialyzed against binding buffer (20 mm Tris and 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) (Dom9His) or binding buffer containing 10 mm imidazole (Dom5His). The dialyzed medium was passed over a cobalt-agarose resin, washed with binding buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, and then eluted with binding buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. Proteins were concentrated by filtration using a 0.5-ml Millipore Ultrafree spin column containing a Biomax membrane with a 5-kDa nominal molecular mass limit. The Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard was used to estimate protein yields. Endo H Digestion—Purified Dom5His was incubated with endo H in buffer containing 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 0.075% SDS, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by silver staining as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—Purified Dom5His was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Facility, Medical College of Wisconsin). Fifteen cycles of Edman degradation were performed, and the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)—Purified Dom5His was mixed with a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample/matrix mixtures were spotted on a MALDI target plate and analyzed on a Voyager DE-PRO MALDI mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) as described previously (34Reddy S.T. Dahms N.M. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 26: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Purified Dom5His (300 μg) was chromatographed on a Superdex-75 fast protein liquid chromatography column (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Biotech) equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 6.5. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the elution profile was monitored at 280 nm. The column was calibrated with the following standards: bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). Chemical Cross-linking—Purified Dom5His (500 ng) was incubated in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 2 mm DTSSP (a homobifunctional cross-linker) for 1 h at 23 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine to 100 mm. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as described previously (35Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that the proteins were detected using an anti-tetrahistidine monoclonal antibody (QIAGEN Inc.) followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Oligosaccharide Microarray Probed with Dom5His and Dom9His— An oligosaccharide array was prepared essentially as described (32Fukui S. Feizi T. Galustian C. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligosaccharides were converted to neoglycolipids by conjugation to 1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. Neoglycolipids and glycolipids (10 pmol in chloroform/methanol/water, 25:25:8 by volume) were applied as 2-mm bands onto nitrocellulose-coated glass slides (FAST slides, Schleicher & Schüll) by jet spray with a Linomat IV sample applicator (Camag, Switzerland). FAST slides with lipid-linked saccharides were immersed at room temperature for 45 min in blocker casein solution, pH 7.4 (Pierce), and then overlaid for 2 h with Dom5His (500 μg/ml) or Dom9His (100 μg/ml) in the same solution. The slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.8, and then overlaid for 1 h with mouse anti-tetrahistidine monoclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml in blocker casein solution, pH 7.4. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, the slide was overlaid for 1 h with a 1:100 dilution of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako Corp.) in blocker casein solution. The slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and antibody binding was detected by development using a nickel-enhanced 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). The image was captured using a digital camera and processed using Corel Photo-Paint software. Pentamannosyl Phosphate-Agarose Affinity Chromatography and Acidic pH Dissociation—Purified Dom5His (4.5 μg) was subjected to pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography (1 ml of resin at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/h) by loading the protein onto the column (0.8 × 4 cm, with a 8-ml reservoir) in 3 ml of column buffer (50 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm MnCl2, pH 6.5). The column was washed with 4 ml of column buffer and then eluted with 1.5 ml of 10 mm Man-6-P in column buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected starting at the beginning of sample application. In other experiments, the protein was loaded and washed in the presence of 10 mm Man-6-P, 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, or 10 mm mannose. For acidic pH dissociation experiments, the protein was loaded and washed with acidic pH 3.5 buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm MnCl2, pH 3.5) followed by elution in acidic pH 3.5 buffer containing 10 mm Man-6-P. Fractions were precipitated with 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were detected by silver staining as described above. The gels were analyzed by densitometry to quantify the amount of protein in each lane using AlphaImager Version 2200 software. Frontal Affinity Chromatography—A single Bio-Rad Econo-Pac polypropylene column (1.5 × 12 cm, with a 10-ml reservoir) was packed with pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose resin (bed volume of 5.3 ml) and used for all frontal chromatographic operations performed at 4 °C. The column was equilibrated with column buffer, and a solution of Dom5His (0.54 μm) prepared in the same buffer was applied to the column continuously at a flow rate of 4 ml/h. Equal volume fractions were collected starting at the beginning of sample application, and the concentration of protein in each fraction was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Multiple runs were performed on the same column in the presence of increasing concentrations of Man-6-P after pre-equilibrating the column with buffer containing the appropriate concentration of Man-6-P. The resin was regenerated by washing with column buffer containing 10 mm Man-6-P followed by washing with acidic pH 3.5 buffer. In the frontal analysis (36Hirabayashi J. Arata Y. Kasai K. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a solution of an analyte, A (Dom5His), is continuously applied to an immobilized low affinity ligand (pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose resin) that specifically interacts with the analyte. A dynamic state of equilibrium is attained once the amount of applied analyte exceeds the retaining capacity of the column and the concentration of the eluted analyte becomes equal to that of the applied analyte. The elution curve of the analyte is thus composed of a front and a plateau, and the elution volume (V) of the front can be determined accurately using Equation 1, V=na+a∑i=1n[A]i[A]o(Eq. 1) where n is the number of a certain fraction at the plateau, a is the volume of one fraction, [A]i is the concentration of fraction i, and [A]o is the initial concentration applied to the column. The elution volume reaches its maximum limit, Vm, when [A]o approaches zero; Vo is the elution volume of the analyte in the presence of saturating amounts of soluble competitive inhibitor, I (Man-6-P), where the specific interaction of the analyte with the immobilized ligand is completely suppressed. The presence of a soluble ligand (I) therefore decreases the elution volume from Vm to Vi (Vi is the elution volume in the presence of I); and under conditions satisfying the requirement of [I]o ≫ [A]o, the amount of adsorbed analyte decreases from [A]o(Vm – Vo) to [A]o(Vi – Vo), and these parameters are related to the dissociation constant (Ki) of the inhibitor by Equation 2. Vi=Vo+KiVm−Vi[I]o(Eq. 2) A plot of Vi versus (Vm – Vi)/[I]o gives a straight line with the slope equal to Ki and the intercept on the ordinate equal to Vo (37Kasai K. Oda Y. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 376: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The results were analyzed by nonlinear regression (SigmaPlot Version 5.05, SPSS Inc.). SPR Analysis of Dom5His—All SPR measurements were performed at 25 °C using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ). Sensor chips, surfactant P20, and amine coupling kits were also obtained from BIAcore. β-Glucuronidase was immobilized on CM5 sensor chips by primary amine coupling according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the chip surface was activated with a solution of 0.4 mmN-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.1 mmN-hydroxysuccinimide followed by injection of β-glucuronidase at a concentration of 18 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. When the desired level of binding was achieved, unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride. The reference surface was treated in the same way as the reaction surface, except that β-glucuronidase was omitted (i.e. under the same coupling conditions to normalize the chemistries between the two flow cells). Samples of purified Dom5His were prepared in running buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20), which was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and degassed prior to use. To collect equilibrium binding data, various concentrations (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, and 200 μm) of the purified analyte (i.e. Dom5His) were injected in a volume of 40 μl over the ligand (β-glucuronidase) and reference flow cells at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. After 60 s, the analyte solutions were replaced with running buffer for 120 s. The surfaces were regenerated with a 180-s injection of running buffer containing 10 mm Man-6-P at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The association, dissociation, and regeneration phases were followed in real-time by monitoring changes in signal expressed in resonance units, and the data are displayed as sensorgrams (response units versus time). An average of the responses at equilibrium was determined for each analyte concentration, and the resulting equilibrium resonance units were plotted against concentration. Data were fit to a steady-state affinity model using BIAevaluation Version 4.0.1 software. All response data were double-referenced (38Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), where controls for the contribution of the change in bulk refractive index were performed in parallel with flow cells derivatized in the absence of ligand and subtracted from all binding sensorgrams. Expression and Purification of Dom5His and Dom9His—The overall sequence similarities and conservation of key residues with other known Man-6-P recognition domains (i.e. domains 3 and 9 of the CI-MPR and the extracytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR) as predicted by the structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 1) support the hypothesis that domain 5 encompasses a carbohydrate-binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2045549815,"We previously proposed that the N-terminal 1000-residue βα1 domain of apolipoprotein B (apoB) forms a bulk lipid pocket homologous to that of lamprey lipovitellin. In support of this “lipid pocket” hypothesis, we demonstrated that apoB:1000 (residues 1-1000) is secreted by a stable transformant of McA-RH7777 cells as a monodisperse particle with high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) density. In contrast, apoB:931 (residues 1-931), missing only 69 residues of the sequence homologous to lipovitellin, was secreted as a particle considerably more dense than HDL3. In the present study we have determined the stoichiometry of the lipid component of the apoB:931 and apoB:1000 particles. The secreted [3H]glycerol-labeled apoB:1000 particles, isolated by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, contained 50 phospholipid (PL) and 11 triacylglycerol (TAG) molecules/particle. In contrast, apoB:931 particles contained only a few molecules of PL and were devoid of TAG. The unlabeled apoB:1000 particles, isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography, contained 56 PL, 8 TAG, and 7 cholesteryl ester molecules/particle. The surface to core lipid ratio of apoB:1000-containing particles was ∼4:1 and was not affected by oleate supplementation. Although very small amounts of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) were associated with apoB:1000 particles, it never approached a 1:1 molar ratio of MTP to apoB. These results support a model in which (i) the first 1000 amino acid residues of apoB are competent to complete the lipid pocket without a structural requirement for MTP; (ii) a portion, or perhaps all, of the amino acid residues between 931 and 1000 of apoB-100 are critical for the formation of a stable, bulk lipid-containing nascent lipoprotein particle, and (iii) the lipid pocket created by the first 1000 residues of apoB-100 is PL-rich, suggesting a small bilayer type organization and has a maximum capacity on the order of 50 molecules of phospholipid.

B has a fundamental role in the transport and metabolism of plasma triacylglycerols (TAG) and cholesterol and is synthesized primarily in hepatocytes and enterocytes (1Schumaker V.N. Phillips M.L.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 22-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). ApoB is present as a single molecule per lipoprotein particle and exists in two forms in humans, apoB-100 and apoB-48. ApoB-100, full-length protein consisting of 4536 amino acid residues (2Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), is an essential structural component for the formation and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), the precursor of low density lipoproteins (LDL), and is expressed primarily in mammalian liver. ApoB-48 (the N-terminal 48% of apoB-100) is produced by a post-transcriptional modification of the apoB mRNA at codon 2153 that converts a glutamine codon to a stop codon (2Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). ApoB-48 is essential for the formation and secretion of chylomicrons and is expressed in mammalian intestine and in the liver of some non-human mammals (2Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The B apolipoproteins are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and thus remain with the lipoprotein particle throughout their metabolism (4Kane J.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because of the size and insoluble nature of this protein, it has been difficult to confirm the structural motifs responsible for lipid-associating properties of this nonexchangeable protein (5Kane J.P. Sata T. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1975; 56: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6Lee D.M. Valente A.J. Kuo W.H. Maeda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 666: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins occurs cotranslationally, i.e. while the C-terminal portion is still being synthesized on the ribosome of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the N-terminal portion is translocated across the ER and is assembled as a small lipoprotein particle. Disulfide-dependent folding of portions of the N-terminal domain of apoB is required for its assembly into lipoprotein (7Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J.

In hepatocytes, the first step in apoB assembly involves the formation of a small particle in the high density lipoprotein (HDL) density range. It has been shown that the translation of the N-terminal 22-29% of apoB-100 is essential for the assembly of apoB-containing particles (8Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol.

However, the precise domain in the N-terminal region of apoB that is required for the initiation of particle assembly, the structural elements of the assembly competent domain, the lipid composition of this nascent particle, the mechanisms by which MTP transfers lipid to the nascent apoB, and the site(s) in the secretory pathway where this transfer occurs are not completely understood and remain controversial. The full-length apoB, essentially the only protein component of the atherogenic LDL, has a pentapartite structure, NH2-βα1-β1-α2-β2-α3-COOH, the β domains containing multiple amphipathic β strands and the α domains containing multiple amphipathic α helices (14Segrest J.P.

Based on sequence homology between the N-terminal domain of apoB and LV, we proposed (19Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Dashti N. J.

We suggested (19Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1346-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that initiation of particle assembly occurs when the βα1 domain folds into a three-sided LV-like lipid-binding cavity, or alternatively, the lipid pocket is formed by association of the region of the βα1 domain homologous to the βA and βB sheets of LV with βD-like amphipathic β sheet from MTP. In this study, we report that, consistent with our previous study (24Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a domain between amino acids 931 and 1000 of apoB-100 is critical for the initiation of particle assembly and formation of a lipid-containing particle. Lipid composition and the number of lipid molecules associated with the secreted apoB-containing particles demonstrated that within the 69 amino acid residues between apoB:931 and apoB:1000, the nature of particles is changed from a lipid-poor to a relatively lipid-enriched particle in the HDL3-like density range. The lack of a 1:1 molar ratio of apoB to MTP observed in this study supports a model in which the first 1000 amino acid residues of apoB are competent to complete the “lipid pocket” without a structural requirement for MTP. This nascent lipoprotein intermediate has a relatively constant Stokes diameter of 112 Å, a mean density of 1.21 g/ml, and has a maximum lipid-transporting capacity on the order of 70 molecules of lipid/particle, primarily phospholipids (PL). The surface to core lipid ratio of ∼4:1 supports a bilayer-like organization that is not responsive to the presence of oleate in the incubation medium.

Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to human apoB-100 was prepared in our laboratory, and affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to bovine MTP 97-kDa large subunit (13Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P.

Wetterau (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.). The antibodies to apoB and MTP 97-kDa subunit were biotinylated at Brookwood Biomedical (Birmingham, AL). ApoB-100 cDNA was a gift from the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco. Construction of Truncated ApoB Expression Plasmids—Truncated apoB cDNAs spanning nucleotides 1-2481, 1-2874, and 1-3081, respectively, of the full-length apoB-100 cDNA, were prepared from pB100L-L (10Yao Z.M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The amplified PCR products were cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector and used to transform cells. Clones harboring the vector were selected and identified by restriction enzyme digestion and nucleotide sequencing of the entire open reading frames. Only clones with 100% correct sequence were used in these studies. The apoB fragments 2481 (apoB:800), 2874 (apoB:931), and 3081 bp (apoB:1000) were excised from the vector, extracted, purified, and ligated into the mammalian expression vector, the Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus LNCX (25Miller A.D. Miller D.G. Garcia J.V. Lynch C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 581-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene that confers G418 resistance for use as a selectable marker. The apoB expression vectors, pLNCB:800, pLNCB:931, and pLNCB: 1000, were used to transform cells, and clones harboring plasmids containing the apoB gene with the correct orientation were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing as described previously (24Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Clonal stable transformants of rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells expressing apoB:800 (B17.64), apoB:931 (B20.52), and apoB:1000 (B22.05) denoting amino acid residues 1-800, 1-931, and 1-1000, respectively, of the mature protein lacking the signal peptide, were generated as described in detail previously (24Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We showed previously (24Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that apoB:800, which lacks the entire βB domain, was secreted as a lipid-poor aggregate, and apoB:1200, which contains 200 residues of the β1 domain was secreted as both lipid-rich and lipid-poor particles. Therefore, although the focus of this study was to determine the role of the domain between amino acids 931 and 1000 of apoB-100 in the initiation of particle assembly and formation of a lipid-containing particle, apoB:800-expressing cells as well as parental nontransfected McA-RH7777 and LNCX (neo)-transfected cells were used as controls. Cells were grown in DMEM containing 20% horse serum, 5% FBS, and 0.2 mg/ml G418, and medium was changed every 48 h. All experiments were conducted with 4-5-day-old cells as described previously (24Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the amounts of culture media used in all experiments were normalized for the expression and secretion level of truncated apoB proteins and total cell protein. Metabolic Labeling Studies—Clonal stable transformants of McARH7777 cells, expressing apoB:800, apoB:931, and apoB:1000, were grown for 4 days in either 6-well dishes for immunoprecipitation studies or in 100-mm dishes for nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (NDGGE) and immunoaffinity chromatography studies as described above. At the start of experiments, maintenance medium was removed, and monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serum-free DMEM containing [3H]glycerol or 0.4 mm [14C]oleic acid bound to 0.75% BSA was added. After the indicated incubation time, labeled conditioned medium was collected, preservative mixture at a final concentrations of 500 units/ml penicillin-G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1.3 mg/ml ϵ-amino caproic acid, 1 mg/ml EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 kallikrein-inactivating units of aprotinin/ml was added to prevent oxidative and proteolytic damage. The medium was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove broken cells and debris. The incorporation of [3H]glycerol or [14C]oleate into various lipid moieties of the secreted apoB-containing lipoproteins was determined by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibody to human apoB-100 or by NDGGE of labeled conditioned medium as described below. Cell monolayers were washed with cold PBS, scraped off the plate in PBS, and sonicated for determination of protein content by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoprotein Isolation—Cells were incubated overnight in 6 ml of serum-free DMEM with or without the labeled precursors. In studies without the labeled precursor, conditioned medium from four 100-mm dishes were combined; preservative mixture was added, and the medium was concentrated 4-fold using Centricon YM-30. The density of the concentrated conditioned medium was adjusted to 1.23 g/ml using solid KBr, and lipoproteins (d < 1.23 g/ml) were isolated by centrifugation for 45 h at 50,000 rpm. The lipoprotein fraction (d < 1.23 g/ml) and infranatant (d > 1.23 g/ml) were dialyzed and concentrated 5-6-fold. In metabolic labeling studies, medium from two 100-mm dishes were pooled, processed as above, and concentrated 2-fold. The density of the concentrated medium was adjusted to 1.23 g/ml and was subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above. Immunoprecipitation—After an overnight (17-20 h) incubation with serum-free medium and [3H]glycerol or 0.4 mm [14C]oleic acid bound to 0.75% BSA, the labeled apoB-containing lipoproteins secreted into the conditioned medium were immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions (27Dashti N.

The beads were washed six to seven times until background count was obtained in the wash and then extracted for lipids as described below. NDGGE—In metabolic labeling studies, aliquots of total medium and d < 1.23 g/ml lipoprotein fraction were run on 4-20% NDGGE; gels were stained and the bands corresponding to apoB:931 and apoB:1000, identified by their Stokes diameter and immunoblotting of a duplicate gel, were excised and analyzed for lipids described below. The incorporation of [3H]glycerol or [14C]oleic acid into total lipids of intact apoB-containing lipoproteins was also determined by NDGGE of the labeled conditioned medium and autoradiography. Isolation of Truncated ApoB-containing Particles by Immunoaffinity Chromatography—Affinity-purified monospecific polyclonal antibody to human apoB-100 was coupled to the cross-linked agarose activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide (Affi-Gel 10). After exhaustive washing of the Affi-Gel with cold, double-distilled water, the antibody solution was added to the gel slurry (2 mg of protein/ml of gel), and the mixture was gently shaken for 2-3 h at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and the remaining active sites were blocked. The gel was then washed and equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1.5 mg/ml EDTA as described previously (30Dashti N. Alaupovic P. Knight-Gibson C. Koren E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4837-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The column was packed with the gel flanked with two layers of Sephadex G-25, a 25-ml bottom layer to minimize the exposure time of lipoproteins to dissociating agent and a 3-ml protective top layer, as described previously (30Dashti N. Alaupovic P. Knight-Gibson C. Koren E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4837-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Stable transformants of McA-RH7777 expressing apoB:931 or apoB: 1000 were grown in 100-mm dishes in serum-containing DMEM for 4 days. Monolayers were washed three times with PBS to remove residual serum and were incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM with or without 0.4 mm oleic acid bound to 0.75% BSA. The conditioned medium from 10 plates was pooled, and preservatives were added. The medium was centrifuged for 30 min at 2000 rpm to remove broken cells and debris. The conditioned medium was concentrated ∼10-fold and applied to the immunoaffinity column. The unretained fraction was eluted with 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1.5 mg/ml EDTA, and the retained fraction was eluted with 5 ml of 4.5 m NaSCN as described previously (30Dashti N. Alaupovic P. Knight-Gibson C. Koren E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4837-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After addition of preservative mixture, the retained fraction was concentrated and analyzed for the mass of PL, TAG, and cholesteryl ester. Lipid Analysis of Isolated Truncated ApoB-containing Particles—Radioactive lipids associated with the immunoprecipitated apoB-containing particles were extracted from protein G with chloroform/methanol (2:1). In NDGGE studies, the bands corresponding to labeled apoB:931-or apoB:1000-containing particles were excised from the gel and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. SDS was added to the final concentration of 0.2%, and the volume of the homogenate was adjusted to 5 ml with distilled water. The homogenate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to dissociate the lipids from the polyacrylamide gel and then lyophilized. Total lipids were extracted from the lyophilized homogenate in a total volume of 10 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1); complete extraction was assessed by counting the final gel homogenate. Total labeled lipids extracted from immunoprecipitated and gel isolated apoB-containing lipoproteins were washed by the Folch method (31Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (32Dashti N. Feng Q. Freeman M.R. Gandhi M. Franklin F.A. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2651-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The final washed extracts were dried under a nitrogen stream, dissolved in small volume of ether, and applied to TLC plate. The bands corresponding to PL, DAG, and TAG, identified by comparison to known standards, were visualized with iodine; each band was scraped off the plate, placed in a counting vial, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In immunoaffinity chromatography studies, the concentrated retained fraction from the anti-apoB immunosorber containing unlabeled apoB:1000-containing particles was analyzed for the mass of TAG and cholesteryl esters by gas chromatography (33Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Marai L. Geher K. J. Chromatogr. Sci. 1975; 13: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and for the mass of PL according to the micro-method of Gerlach and Deuticke (34Gerlach E. Deuticke B. Biochem. Z. 1963; 337: 477-479PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—The isolated apoB-containing particles were run on 4-12% SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) or on 4-20% NDGGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were detected by Western blot analysis (36Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5888) Google Scholar) using biotinylated antibody to human apoB-100 as described previously (24Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Calculation of Number of Lipid Molecules/Particle—Calculations were made essentially as described by Carraway et al.

https://openalex.org/W2083872341,"The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit enzyme that acidifies intracellular organelles in eukaryotes. Similar to the F-type ATP synthase (FATPase), the V-ATPase is composed of two subcomplexes, V1 and V0. Hydrolysis of ATP in the V1 subcomplex is tightly coupled to proton translocation accomplished by the V0 subcomplex, which is composed of five unique subunits (a, d, c, c′, and c″). Three of the subunits, subunit c (Vma3p), c′ (Vma11p), and c″ (Vma16p), are small highly hydrophobic integral membrane proteins called “proteolipids” that share sequence similarity to the F-ATPase subunit c. Whereas subunit c from the F-ATPase spans the membrane bilayer twice, the V-ATPase proteolipids have been modeled to have at least four transmembrane-spanning helices. Limited proteolysis experiments with epitope-tagged copies of the proteolipids have revealed that the N and the C termini of c (Vma3p) and c′ (Vma11p) were in the lumen of the vacuole. Limited proteolysis of epitope-tagged c″ (Vma16p) indicated that the N terminus is located on the cytoplasmic face of the vacuole, whereas the C terminus is located within the vacuole. Furthermore, a chimeric fusion between Vma16p and Vma3p, Vma16-Vma3p, was found to assemble into a fully functional V-ATPase complex, further supporting the conclusion that the C terminus of Vma16p resides within the lumen of the vacuole. These results indicate that subunits c and c′ have four transmembrane segments with their N and C termini in the lumen and that c″ has five transmembrane segments, with the N terminus exposed to the cytosol and the C terminus lumenal.

Hirata R. Wada Y. Ohya Y. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 67-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Organelle acidification is essential for a variety of cellular processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, activation of proteases, and proton-coupled transport of small molecules and ions (2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 3Graham L.A. Flannery A.R. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg.

Similar to the F-type ATP synthase, the V-ATPase is composed of two distinct sectors; a peripheral catalytic complex (V1) and a membrane associated complex (V0). The peripheral catalytic V1 subcomplex is a 560-kDa domain composed of eight subunits (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H). Its catalytic core is composed of a hexameric ring of alternating A (69 kDa) and B (57 kDa) subunits (5Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the A and B subunits contain consensus sequences for ATP binding domains, where subunit A has been ascribed with the catalytic function (6Hirata R. Ohsumk Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subunit B is proposed to have a regulatory role (7Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The role of the other V1 subunits is not so clear. It is thought that the central stalk may be composed of D (32 kDa) and F (14 kDa) subunits (8Arata Y. Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Shao E. Wilkens S. Forgac M. Biochim. Biophys.

All subunits are required for a fully assembled complex with the exception of the H subunit; however, the H subunit is required for a functional complex (14Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane-associated V0 subcomplex is composed of five subunits (a, c, c′, c″, and d). There is a ring of the proteolipid subunits Vma3p (16.5 kDa, subunit c), Vma11p (17 kDa, subunit c′), and Vma16p (23 kDa, subunit c″), and each proteolipid subunit contains a conserved acidic residue required for proton translocation (15Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The proteolipid ring contains one copy each of the c′ and c″ subunits (16Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), with 4-5 copies of subunit c (4Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The a (100-kDa) subunit has two isoforms, Vph1p and Stv1p. The two isoforms specify to which organelles the V-ATPase complex is routed; the Vph1p containing V-ATPase complex localizes to the vacuole, whereas the Stv1p-containing complex remains in the Golgi/endosome membranes (17Kawasaki-Nishi S.

Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The a subunit contains two domains, a hydrophilic N terminus domain believed to form part of the stator and a hydrophobic carboxyl domain, which also forms part of the proton pore (19Leng X.H.

The function of the d (36 kDa) subunit is currently unknown, but recently a x-ray crystal structure has been published, in which the authors propose that the d subunit may cap the top of the proteolipid ring (22Iwata M. Imamura H. Stambouli E. Ikeda C. Tamakoshi M. Nagata K. Makyio H. Hankamer B. Barber J. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Iwata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Like the F-type ATP synthase, the V-ATPase has been shown to work by a rotary mechanism. ATP is hydrolyzed by the A subunit causing a conformation change and, thus, rotating the central stalk composed of F and D (23Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K.

Imamura H. Yoshida M. Tamakoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24255-24258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The c subunit ring rotates relative to the stator, thus pumping protons with a rotary mechanism. Unlike the F-type ATP synthase, the VATPase functions physiologically to pump protons across the lipid bilayer and not to synthesize ATP. NMR and x-ray crystallography studies have shown that the F-type ATP synthase 8-kDa-subunit forms an α-helical hairpin with two transmembrane helices such that the N termini and the C termini oriented away from the F1 subcomplex (26Stock D.

However, based upon the similarity to the F-type ATP synthase c subunit and hydropathy plots, Vma3p and Vma11p can be modeled to have four transmembrane helices and Vma16p to have five transmembrane helices (3Graham L.A. Flannery A.R. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The VATPase subunits may have arisen from a gene duplication event of a common c subunit ancestor (30Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This would suggest that the orientation of the termini of Vma3p and Vma11p would lie within the lumen of the vacuole, whereas Vma16p would have either the N terminus or the C terminus in the lumen of the vacuole. Previous studies have suggested that Vma16p (c″) has either four (33Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or five (34Gibson L.C. Cadwallader G. Finbow M.E. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 911-919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) transmembrane regions, and these studies came to different conclusions about the requirement for the first putative transmembrane helix of Vma16p. In this paper we describe the molecular and biochemical approach that we used to address the topology of Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p. We have attached epitope tags to the N and C termini of these three subunits and used protease protection assays to determine the orientation of the termini. Through immunoblot analysis of the limited proteolysis we have determined that the N and C termini of Vma3p and Vma11p are located within the lumen of the vacuole, whereas the N terminus of Vma16p is located in the cytoplasm, and the C terminus is in the lumen. In addition, we have also constructed chimeric fusions of Vma16p and Vma3p that further support our topological model of Vma16p. Strains and Culture Conditions—The yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables I and II. All yeast strains were cultured in SD minimal media (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids or YEPD medium buffered to pH 5.0 using 50 mm succinate/phosphate. To test for a Vma- phenotype, saturated cultures were diluted to an A600 = 0.25. Serial dilutions of the diluted culture were applied to pH 7.5 YEPD plus 100 mm CaCl2 media and allowed to grow overnight before observing results.Table ISaccharomyces cervevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceSF838-1DαMATα, ade6, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, pep4-3, his4-519, gal 2Ref. 51Rothman J.H.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid Construction and Epitope Tagging—DNA sequence encoding a single c-Myc epitope was introduced immediately after the start codon of pLG84 to generate pAJ82 by PCR using outward facing oligonucleotides. PCR using outward-facing oligonucleotides was also used to delete base pairs 34-114 from pAJ82 to generate pLG96. QuikChange mutagenesis was used to introduce an MluI site (A/CGCGT) immediately after the start codon of VMA3 in plasmid pRHA316 (16Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PCR was used to construct a 1×HA::VMA3 from pLG93 that was flanked by an MluI 5′ site and a BglII 3′ site. The MluI/BglII-digested PCR fragment was then ligated into a MluI/BglII-digested pLG93 to create pAF271. QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to introduce a BglII site ((A/G)ATCT) immediately after the start codon in pRS316VMA11(pNUVA388) to generate pLG159. Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized so that when annealed together they formed an oligonucleotide duplex encoding a single HA epitope with BglII ends. The oligonucleotide duplex was ligated into BglII-digested pLG159 to generate pLG171. QuikChange mutagenesis was used to introduce an MluI site (A/CGCGT) immediately after the start codon in pLG93 to generate pLG101. A VMA16::3×HA fragment was generated from pLG84 by PCR using oligonucleotides that introduced MluI sites on the ends of the PCR fragment. MluI-digested pLG101 was ligated with MluI-digested VMA16::3×HA PCR fragment to generate pLG146. A BglII site was inserted immediately after the start codon in pRS316VMA16::c-myc (pLG33) to generate pLG94. A 3×HA BglII fragment from BJ7122 was ligated into digested pLG33 to form pLG94. A 3×HA::VMA16 PCR fragment was generated from pLG94 by PCR using oligonucleotides that introduce MluI sites on the ends of the fragment. QuikChange mutagenesis was used to also introduce a MluI site immediately before the stop codon of pRS316VMA3 (pRHA313) to generate pLG100. The 3×HA::VMA16 MluI-digested PCR fragment was ligated with digested pLG100 to create pLG145. Proteolytic Protection Assays—Intact vacuolar vesicles were isolated using a previously described procedure with modifications (21Jackson D.D. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast were grown to log phase of A600 = 4.0 in YEPD medium buffered to pH 5.0, cells were converted to spheroplast, and lysed with a loosely fitting Dounce homogenizer in Buffer A (10 mm Mes/Tris, pH 6.9, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 12% Ficoll). The lysate was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 45 min in a swinging bucket rotor. The floating white layer containing the vacuoles were removed with a weigh spatula and resuspended in 10 ml of modified buffer 88 (M88) (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm CaCl2, 250 mm sorbitol). The vacuoles were recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 × g, washed twice in M88 buffer, and brought up to a final protein concentration of 4 mg/ml. Samples containing 1 mg of protein were treated at 4 °C with trypsin (0.5 mg/ml) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) in the absence or presence of 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 40% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were pelleted at 13,000 × g and washed with an equal volume of ice-cold acetone. The pellets were resuspended in Thorner buffer (8 m urea, 5% SDS, 40 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml bromphenol blue, β-mercaptoethanol added fresh to 5%), and 10 μg of protein was loaded per lane of a SDS-PAGE. Protein Preparation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell extracts and vacuolar membranes were prepared as described previously (35Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 408-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis was performed. Proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose and probed with either an affinity-purified monoclonal anti-HA (Covance Research Products Inc.) used at 1:3000, the anti-Myc 9E10 described previously (37Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) used at 1:5, antibodies 10D7 or 7B1 used to probe for Vph1p at 1:500 (Molecular Probes), the monoclonal antibody 13D11 directed against Vma2p used at 1:1000 (Molecular Probes), or the monoclonal antibody 10E5 used to probe for CPY at 1:500 (Molecular Probes). Proteins were visualized using affinity-purified donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:20000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) and chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) Fluorescence Microscopy—Quinacrine staining of live yeast cells was conducted as previously described (36Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 408-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with the following modification. Concanavalin A TRITC (Molecular Probes) was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml with the quinacrine to allow for visualization of the cell surface. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and manipulated using AxioVision software. Native Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were carried out as previously described with the following exceptions (16Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 1 mg of solubilized membranes was precleared with the addition of 50 μl of 50% slurry of Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). 5 μl of affinity-purified goat anti-HA antibody (Novus Biologicals) was added to the pre-cleared supernatant and agitated at 4 °C for 1 h. 50 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected with a brief centrifugation and washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% C12E9. The beads were resuspended in 200 μl of Thorner buffer, and 20 μl of the supernatant was loaded per well of SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. V-ATPase Assays—ATPase activity was measured by a coupled spectrophotometric assay in the absence and presence of 1 μm concanamycin A, as described previously (36Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 408-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Determining Topology of C Termini for Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p—To determine whether the C termini of Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p are located on the cytosolic face of the vacuole or in the lumen, the proteins were epitope-tagged with the HA epitope on their C termini. Previous reports demonstrated that strains expressing tagged copies of Vma3p, Vma11p, or Vma16p produced V-ATPase complexes indistinguishable from wild-type cells (15Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 16Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), indicating that the epitope-tagged forms of these proteins are fully functional. To determine the topology of the proteins, the intact vesicles were isolated from strains expressing tagged Vma3p, Vma11p, or Vma16p and subjected to limited proteolysis. Vacuoles were incubated with a mixture of proteinase K and trypsin either in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 at 0 °C for 10 min (21Jackson D.D. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed on the time points taken during the protease reaction. Two proteins, Vph1p and CPY, were monitored as controls. Vph1p confirms the accessibility of the proteases to proteins oriented on the cytoplasmic side, whereas CPY validates the intactness of the vacuoles. Using the 7B1 anti-Vph1p antibody, Jackson and Stevens (21Jackson D.D. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) show that the N-terminal domain of Vph1p is located in the cytoplasm and is easily susceptible to proteolytic degradation without compromising the integrity of the membrane. CPY is translated with a propeptide domain, which is cleaved when CPY reaches the vacuole to yield the mature form of CPY (36Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 408-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because vacuoles were isolated from a yeast strain deficient in active vacuolar proteases due to a mutation in the PEP4 gene, only the proCPY form was present in the vacuole. The anti-Vph1p blot in Fig. 1a illustrates that the protein is degraded by protease in both the absence or presence of detergent, confirming the proteases were active. In contrast, the shift of the proCPY form to the mature CPY can only be seen in the presence of detergent, confirming the intactness of the vacuoles. These results indicate that the isolated vacuoles were properly oriented and intact throughout the limited proteolysis assay. The samples were also probed using an antibody directed against the HA epitope (Fig. 1a). The epitopes present on Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p were intact after 10-min of incubation with the proteases in the absence of detergent, indicating that they were not accessible to the proteases. The epitopes were only digested when the membranes were solubilized before the addition of the proteases. These results are consistent with the C termini of Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p oriented toward the lumen of the vacuole. The N Termini of Vma3p and Vma11p Are Lumenal—Hydropathy plots predict that Vma3p and Vma11p contain four transmembrane segments. Therefore, if this model is correct and the C termini are in the lumen of the vacuole, then the N termini should also be present within the lumen. To test this hypothesis, N-terminal epitope-tagged Vma3p and Vma11p were constructed. Yeast deletion strains of vma3Δ or vma11Δ expressing the corresponding plasmid-borne N-terminal tagged protein grew on pH 7.5-buffered media containing 100 mm CaCl2 (data not shown), a standard test for V-ATPase function (3Graham L.A. Flannery A.R. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Vacuoles were isolated from cells expressing N-terminal-tagged Vma3p or Vma11p and also subjected to protease digestion followed by immunoblot analysis. As with the C-terminal epitopes, Fig. 1b shows that the N-terminal HA epitope of both Vma3p and Vma11p were protected from proteolysis in the absence of detergent and degraded only with detergent present. These results support the hypothesis that there are four transmembrane regions and the N termini, and C termini of both Vma3p and Vma11p are orientated toward the lumen of the vacuole. The N Terminus of Vma16p Is Cytosolic—Unlike Vma3p or Vma11p, Vma16p is predicted to form five putative transmembrane regions. Nishi et al. (33Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34122-34130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggest that the N termini and C termini of Vma16p are both cytosolic, implying that there would be only four transmembrane regions. However, other studies suggest that Vma16p has five transmembrane regions (34Gibson L.C. Cadwallader G. Finbow M.E. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 911-919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kim H. Melen K. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10208-10213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the C terminus of Vma16p is oriented toward the lumen (Fig. 1a). If Vma16p forms five transmembrane regions, then one would predict the N terminus to be oriented toward the cytosol, whereas if only four transmembrane regions are present, then the N terminus of Vma16p should be located in the lumen of the vacuole. To further test these models a doubly epitope-tagged protein was constructed, subjected to protease treatment, and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. The c-Myc epitope was placed on the N terminus of the previously C-terminal HA-tagged Vma16p. Cells expressing a copy of the doubly epitope-tagged Vma16p were able to confer wild-type growth on pH 7.5 YEPD containing 100 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 2c). Vacuoles were isolated from cells expressing the doubly tagged Vma16p and treated with proteases in the presence or absence of detergent. The Vph1p and CPY controls indicated that the proteases were active, and the vacuoles were intact (Fig. 2a). Samples probed with an antibody recognizing the c-Myc tag illustrate that the Myc epitope is labile both in the absence and presence of detergent, indicating that Vma16p contains five transmembrane regions since the N terminus of Vma16p is on the cytosolic face of the vacuole (Fig. 2a). The C-terminal HA tag was protected from protease digestion unless the membranes were solubilized with detergent as previously observed (Fig. 2a). The same results were observed for the N terminus and the C terminus of Vma16p if the epitope tags were transposed (N-terminal HA and C-terminal c-Myc; data not shown). These results support the model th"

As the remarkable anticoagulant properties of this mutant continue to be unraveled in preclinical studies, we solved the x-ray crystal structures of its free form and its complex with the active site inhibitor H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (PPACK). The PPACK-bound structure of W215A/E217A is identical to the structure of the PPACK-bound slow form of thrombin. On the other hand, the structure of the free form reveals a collapse of the 215-217 strand that crushes the primary specificity pocket. The collapse results from abrogation of the stacking interaction between Phe-227 and Trp-215 and the polar interactions of Glu-217 with Thr-172 and Lys-224. Other notable changes are a rotation of the carboxylate group of Asp-189, breakage of the H-bond between the catalytic residues Ser-195 and His-57, breakage of the ion pair between Asp-222 and Arg-187, and significant disorder in the 186- and 220-loops that define the Na+ site.

These findings explain the impaired catalytic activity of W215A/E217A and demonstrate that the analysis of the molecular basis of substrate recognition by thrombin and other proteases requires crystallization of both the free and bound forms of the enzyme. Thrombin possesses a paradoxical combination of procoagulant and anticoagulant roles (1Griffin J.H. Nature. 1995; 378: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The procoagulant role involves the cleavage of fibrinogen and the platelet receptor PAR1, leading, respectively, to fibrin polymerization and platelet aggregation (2Di Cera E. Chest. 2003; 124: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The anticoagulant role unfolds on interaction with thrombomodulin and activation of protein C that eventually inhibits thrombin generation (3Esmon C.T. Chest. 2003; 124: 26-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The dual role of thrombin has long raised interest in dissociating its procoagulant and anticoagulant activities (4Wu Q.Y. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Birktoft J.J. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl.

These efforts have culminated in the design of anticoagulant thrombin mutants that are capable of activating protein C but show significantly reduced activity toward fibrinogen and PAR1 both in vitro and in vivo (6Gibbs C.S.

Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and shows a safe and potent anticoagulant/antithrombotic profile in vivo (9Gruber A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Hanson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27581-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mutant has drastically reduced (4-5 orders of magnitude) catalytic activity toward all thrombin substrates, whether chromogenic or natural. However, in the presence of thrombomodulin, the activity of the mutant toward protein C is restored to a level comparable with that of the wild type (8Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As a result, WE can circulate in the blood for hours, acting to increase the concentration of the anticoagulant-activated protein C without eliciting any significant fibrinogen clotting or platelet aggregation (9Gruber A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Hanson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27581-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of WE as a potential treatment for fatal or debilitating thrombo-occlusive events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, there is a compelling reason to characterize its structural properties. Here we present the structures of WE free and bound to the active site inhibitor H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (PPACK). The structures offer precious insights into the molecular basis of WE function, which also bear on studies of substrate recognition by thrombin and proteases in general. The mutant WE was expressed, purified, and tested for activity as described previously (8Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mutant was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 50 mm choline chloride, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0. For crystallization with PPACK, the mutant was mixed with the inhibitor at a molar ratio of 1:15 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Crystallization was achieved at 25 °C by vapor diffusion, with each crystallization well containing 500 μl of reservoir solution. Equal volumes of the protein sample and reservoir solution (1 μl each) were mixed to prepare the hanging drops. The reservoir solution consisted of 18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m zinc acetate, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. The reservoir solution for the free form of WE was composed of 0.1 m CAPS, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 0.12 m sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and 0.53 m dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.9. Diffraction quality crystals of both PPACK-inhibited and free WE were grown within 2 weeks. Crystals were cryoprotected in a solution similar to the reservoir solution but containing 25% glycerol prior to flash freezing. X-ray diffraction data for the WE-PPACK complex were recorded on an R axis image plate detector and processed and scaled with Denzo and Scalepack (10, Otwinowski, Z.

Data for the free form were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (beamline Biocars 14-BMC, Argonne National Laboratory) and processed using the HKL2000 software package (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38698) Google Scholar). The WE-PPACK crystal was orthorhombic of space group P212121 and contained one molecule per asymmetric unit. The free WE crystal was cubic of space group P213 and contained two molecules per asymmetric unit. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the thrombin-PPACK complex (12Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) as a search model and the program package Crystallography NMR System (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

In the free WE structure, part of the 220-loop in the first monomer and a portion of the 186-loop in the second monomer were not included in the model because of their weak electron density. This observation is notable and underscores disorder in two critical loop regions of the molecule that are always well ordered in the wild type (12Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A.

Except for this difference, the two monomers in the asymmetric units could be refined without constraints to nearly identical conformations, showing a r.m.s. deviation of 0.42 Å over 270 equivalent Cα atoms and no regions of significant difference in backbone configuration. Refinement carried out with noncrystallographic symmetry restraints produced essentially the same results, with no improvement in Rcryst and Rfree. Monomer B, with the 220-loop intact, was chosen for structural comparisons. Weak densities were also detected in the N- and C-terminal regions, which were not included in subsequent refinement. Crystal contacts involved the exosite I region of one monomer and exosite II region of the second monomer in which the closest distance was 6.0 Å. The contacts did not involve any of the regions showing significant structural changes compared with the PPACK-bound form. The two monomers of free WE in the asymmetric unit make lattice contact with seven molecules related crystallographically, but the closest contact to the mutated residues 215 and 217 in either monomer is a distance of approximately 25 Å. Water molecules were added in the final stage of the refinement process. They were subjected to visual inspection to check their positioning in electron density and allowed to refine freely. Water molecules with a temperature factor (B factor) >80 Å2 were excluded from subsequent refinement. Structural comparisons were computed using LSQMAN (16Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab The backbone traces of the structures of WE free or bound to PPACK are shown in Fig. 1. The structure of WE bound to the active site inhibitor PPACK is practically identical to that of the wild type (12Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A.

The autolysis loop is quite disordered, as is usually found in thrombin structures at this resolution (2.4 Å). Remarkably, the backbone region of the 215-217 strand hosting the mutated residues 215 and 217 retains the wild-type architecture of the SL structure (Fig. 2). Valence screening of the solvent molecules using WASP (17Nayal M. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) returns no values >0.5 valence units for possible bound Na+. Close examination of the Na+-binding site of WE-PPACK reveals no evidence of bound Na+, even though the complex was crystallized in the presence of 0.1 m sodium cacodylate. Remarkably, the water molecules in this region overlap 1:1 with those identified in the SL structure, recently solved at a resolution of 1.55 Å (15Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S.

These findings are consistent with the lack of Na+ binding and allosteric transduction in the WE mutant (8Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Stereo view of the active site, primary specificity pocket, and Na+-binding site of the thrombin mutant WE.

Notwithstanding the drastic difference in atomic resolution (2.4 Å for WE-PPACK and 1.55 Å for SL), the two structures are remarkably similar overall (r.m.s. deviation = 0.4 Å). There is no evidence of bound Na+ in the WE-PPACK structure, and there is a notable 1:1 correspondence for the water molecules in the Na+ site between the two structures. Relevant side chains are labeled. In the WE structure, the side chain of Lys-224 moves away from residue 217 because of the E217A mutation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The structure of free WE shows notable changes relative to the wild type in its free form (15Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and provides a molecular basis for understanding the devastating effects of the Ala replacement of Trp-215 and Glu-217 on substrate recognition. Because of the modest resolution of the crystal structure (2.8 Å), the autolysis loop is not visible nor are water molecules in the primary specificity pocket, the Na+ site, or the active site region. Also subject to considerable disorder are the 186- and 220-loops that define the Na+ site. The 220-loop is ordered only in one monomer in the asymmetric unit, whereas the 186-loop is ordered only in the other monomer. Disorder in these loops has never been reported in >150 structures of thrombin deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The disorder is a result of the WE mutation and is likely exacerbated by the low resolution of the structure. As a consequence of the disorder in the 186- and 220-loops, the ion pair between Asp-222 and Arg-187 cannot be defined. Formation of this ion pair is a hallmark of the Na+-induced conformational transition of thrombin from the slow to the fast form (15Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast to the disorder documented in the 186- and 220-loops, well defined density exists for other important regions of the enzyme. The 215-217 strand hosting the replaced residues Trp-215 and Glu-217 collapses into the primary specificity site and obliterates access of the Arg of substrate in the S1 cavity (Fig. 3). The collapse leaves behind Phe-227, normally in stacking interaction with Trp-215, and causes a shift in the position of its benzene ring. Contributing to the collapse also is the abrogation of important polar interactions of Glu-217 with Thr-172 and Lys-224, which stabilize the fast form of thrombin (15Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The WE mutant shows a 35,000-fold drop in the kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (FPR), which is the cleavable analog of PPACK (8Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This drastic perturbation of substrate recognition is explained by the collapse of the 215-217 strand that comes in close contact (within 3 Å) with the 189-192 strand. Coupled to this change, the carboxylate group of Asp-189 in the primary specificity pocket reorients almost 90° and aligns parallel to the backbone of the 189-192 strand instead of being perpendicular to it as in the wild type. The orientation of Asp-189 precludes ionic interaction with the guanidinium group of the incoming Arg of substrate. The side chain of Glu-192 is oriented as in the PPACK-inhibited form of WE and is in the same orientation as the PPACK-bound fast form (FL) of the wild type (15Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The catalytic Ser-195, on the other hand, experiences a main chain movement of 0.5 Å and a rotation in its side chain of approximately 70° relative to the PPACK-inhibited form, causing a breakage of the H-bond with the catalytic His-57. This orientation is similar to that seen in the free slow form(s) of the wild type (15Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Some of the structural changes in the free form of WE are reminiscent of those observed in the S structure of the wild type reported recently (15Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Specifically, the absence of the Asp-222: Arg-187 ion pair, the breakage of the H-bond interaction between Ser-195 and His-57, and the reorientation of the side chain of Asp-189 are also seen in the S structure. It is possible that these changes are a direct manifestation of the lack of Na+ binding in the WE mutant. In addition to these structural signatures that pertain to the slow form of thrombin, the structure of WE contains features that are entirely the result of the double mutation. The replacement of Trp-215 and Glu-217 with Ala causes a detachment of the 215-217 strand that crushes the primary specificity pocket. The movement likely causes disorder in the 186- and 220-loops that define much of the Na+ site and the entry point of the cation (18Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These additional changes explain why the catalytic properties of WE are compromised >1,000-fold relative to those of the slow form of the wild type. The WE mutant of thrombin is currently being evaluated in preclinical studies as an effective anticoagulant and antithrombotic drug (9Gruber A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Hanson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27581-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A remarkable property of this mutant is that it shows very little catalytic activity toward chromogenic or natural substrates of thrombin. The kcat/Km values for substrate hydrolysis are compromised 1000-fold for PAR1, 20,000-fold for fibrinogen, and up to 35,000-fold for the chromogenic substrate FPR (8Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The kcat/Km value for the hydrolysis of protein C in the absence of thrombomodulin is <1 m-1 s-1 (8Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mutation involves two residues that play a critical role in substrate recognition. Trp-215 is highly conserved in the entire realm of serine proteases, and both Trp-215 and Glu-217 are absolutely conserved in thrombins from hagfish to human (19Banfield D.K. MacGillivray R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the free form of WE provides a striking explanation for the drastic drop in catalytic activity. Mutation of Trp-215 abrogates the important stacking interaction with the benzene ring of Phe-227, and mutation of Glu-217 abrogates polar interactions of its side chain with Thr-172 and Lys-224. As a result, the 215-217 strand detaches from its position as a wall of the primary specificity pocket and crashes on the neighboring 189-192 strand. This prevents the Arg at the P1 position of incoming substrate to access the side chain of Asp-189 at the bottom of the S1 site. The compromised catalytic activity of WE is advantageous in vivo because it ensures that the mutant can circulate in the blood without causing fibrinogen clotting or platelet aggregation. When the mutant WE interacts with thrombomodulin, however, its activity toward protein C increases 60,000-fold, to a level comparable with that of the wild type (8Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mutant thus acts as a molecular switch that turns on its catalytic activity only in the presence of thrombomodulin and protein C. This is the basis of its potent anticoagulant effect in vivo (9Gruber A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Hanson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27581-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). What is the mechanism that rescues the catalytic activity of WE toward protein C in the presence of thrombomodulin? It is tempting to speculate that thrombomodulin corrects the collapse of the 215-217 strand and restores access to the primary specificity pocket. If so, thrombomodulin should be able to significantly enhance the catalytic activity of WE toward FPR. However, the kcat/Km value for FPR hydrolysis by WE improves only 3-fold in the presence of saturating (100 nm) concentrations of thrombomodulin (Fig. 4). The 3-fold increase is also observed in the presence of saturating (100 μm) concentrations of hirugen (Fig. 4). These effects are analogous to those observed with the wild type and argue against thrombomodulin being an allosteric effector of thrombin (20Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that thrombomodulin induces significant changes in the primary specificity pocket of WE. An alternative hypothesis is that thrombomodulin acts as a scaffold for presenting protein C to the thrombin active site in a correct orientation for cleavage (20Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This hypothesis explains the effects of thrombomodulin in the wild type and does not call for conformational changes in the mutant WE, consistent with the data in Fig. 4; however, the hypothesis fails to explain how the collapsed active site of WE is functionally restored to interact with protein C. A plausible scenario is that formation of the ternary complex WE-thrombomodulin-protein C causes a large induced fit transition in the active site of the enzyme that cannot take place when either protein C or thrombomodulin are separately bound. The concerted action of protein C and thrombomodulin turns WE into a molecular switch that only delivers its anticoagulant function. An important implication of the results reported in this study is that no relevant information on the molecular properties of WE would have emerged from the structure of the mutant bound to PPACK. The thermodynamic definition of a binding constant in the ground state or the transition state involves the chemical potentials of the bound and free species; hence, structural analysis of substrate recognition cannot be based exclusively on information from the enzyme-substrate complex. This becomes even more obvious in the case of mutant enzymes, in which the effect of the structural perturbation may be confined to the free form. A direct demonstration of this possibility is offered by the thrombin mutant Y225I. Although its catalytic activity toward FPR and fibrinogen is compromised >10,000-fold, its crystal structure bound to PPACK is identical to that of PPACK-inhibited wild type (15Pineda A.O.

Crystallization of thrombin in its free form is beset by many difficulties, including the need to prevent autodigestion. In a recent study (23Pineda A.O. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), removal of the site of autocatalytic cleavage in exosite I ensured crystallization of the free form of thrombin for the first time. In the case of thrombin mutants with severely compromised catalytic activity, there is in principle no need to remove this site of cleavage. The crystal structure of the anticoagulant mutant E217K has recently been solved in the free form (24Carter W.J. Myles T. Gibbs C.S. Leung L.L. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26387-26394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As for the WE mutant presented in this study, the structure of free E217K reveals changes in the active site region, resulting from the drastic charge reversal at residue 217, that explain the perturbed functional properties of the mutant. The structure of E217K bound to PPACK was not presented in the study, but it would have been a critical comparison with those of Y225I-PPACK (22Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Futterer K. Waksman G.

We have now demonstrated that it is possible, and indeed highly desirable, to crystallize thrombin mutants with compromised catalytic activity in both their free and PPACK-bound forms. The information on the free form is highly relevant to the biochemical properties of such mutants. Comparison of the free and bound forms affords a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of substrate recognition, which has a bearing on the study of protease specificity in general."

During translocation of glucose, a phosphoryl group derived from phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred sequentially along a series of proteins to the transported glucose molecule, eventually converting it into glucose 6-phosphate. The sequence of phosphotransfer is from phosphoenolpyruvate to the general PTS proteins enzyme I and HPr and further to the carbohydrate-specific cytoplasmic EIIAGlc, membrane-bound EIICBGlc, and glucose. The PTS takes an important part in metabolic adaptation to environmental changes to compete effectively with ambient organisms by sensing the availability of nutrients in the environment. In addition to sugar transport, multiple roles are exerted by the PTS and these include chemoreception (3Lux R. Jahreis K. Bettenbrock K. Parkinson J.S. Lengeler J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recently, we found that EIIAGlc of the PTS also regulates the flux between respiration and fermentation pathways by sensing the available sugar species via a phosphorylation state-dependent interaction with the fermentation/respiration switch protein FrsA (10Koo B.-M. Yoon M.-J. Lee C.-R. Nam T.-W. Choe Y.-J. Jaffe H. Peterkofsky A. Seok Y.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31613-31621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For this reason, synthesis of the PTS components should be regulated in a highly sophisticated way. It was reported that expression of the pts operon and the ptsG gene increases a few fold during growth on glucose or other PTS substrates (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the functional cAMP·CRP complex is essential for the expression of the ptsG gene (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol.

From further studies, it was revealed that the expression of the ptsHIcrr operon and the ptsG gene is subject to complex regulation. It was shown that the ptsH P1 promoter is regulated by the repressor of the fructose PTS, FruR (12Ryu S. Ramseier T.M. Michotey V. Saier Jr., M.H. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2489-2496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, both the ptsH P0 promoter and the ptsG P1 promoter have been shown to be subject to activation by the cAMP·CRP complex and repression by Mlc (13Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the unphosphorylated form of EIICBGlc can relieve the repression of the Mlc regulon by sequestering Mlc through the direct protein-protein interaction to induce the expression of the Mlc regulon including PTS proteins (19Lee S.J. Boos W. Bouche J.P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Nam T.-W. Cho S.-H. Shin D. Kim J.-H. Jeong J.-Y. Lee J.-H. Roe J.-H. Peterkofsky A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5344-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also found that glucose-induced expression of ptsG is enhanced significantly under heat shock, and it was thus proposed that this enhancement may counteract the highly increased mlc expression upon heat shock, whereby normal glucose metabolism is maintained at high growth temperatures (22Shin D. Lim S. Seok Y.-J. Ryu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25871-25875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to the regulations at the transcriptional level, expression of ptsG is regulated post-transcriptionally via modulation of ptsG mRNA stability in response to glycolytic flux in the cells (23Kimata K. Tanaka Y. Inada T. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the expression of the PTS proteins is regulated in a highly complex and dynamic manner in response to various growth environments as well as the availability of carbon sources. In addition to the regulators of PTS expression mentioned above, we thought that there might be other factor(s) regulating PTS expression in E. coli. This prospective stimulated us to embark on ligand fishing experiments to search for other transcriptional regulator(s) exhibiting high affinity interaction to promoters of the pts operon and the ptsG gene. Consequently, we found that ArcA specifically binds to these promoters. Here we have investigated the negative regulation of ptsG expression by phospho-ArcA. Materials—cAMP was obtained from Sigma. RNA polymerase saturated with σ70, nucleotide triphosphates, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]UTP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The cycle sequencing kit was from Epicenter Technologies (Madison, WI). Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. The arcA mutant was constructed using E. coli DY330 as described previously (24Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The arcA gene (from the start codon to the stop codon) was replaced by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat). The cat gene was amplified by PCR from SR702 (ptsG::cat) with the following primers: forward primer, 5′-TAACACGCAACACGTTGAAAAGTATTTTCGAAGCGGAAGGCTATGATGTTATGGAGAAAAAAATCACTGG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ATAAAAACGGCGCTAAAAAGCGCCGTTTTTTTTGACGGTGGTAAAGCCGATTACGCCCCGCCCTGCCACT-3′. The PCR product was electroporated into E. coli DY330 to make the strain YJ2000. MC4100 Δ arcA (YJ2001) was constructed by P1 transduction of the Cmr region of DY330 ΔarcA. Disruption of the arcA gene was confirmed by PCR. Strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C unless otherwise specified. The mlc deletion strain DY330 mlc::TetR (YJ2004) was prepared by using the following primers: 5′-CACCATAGCCTACAGATTATTTCGGAGCGCGAAAATATAGGGAGTATGCGTTAAGACCCACTTTCACATT-3′ and 5′-AAAATGTTAACCCTGCAACAGACGAATCAACAAAGAACCGTTATACATCGCTAAGCACTTGTCTCCTGTT-3′. The TetR region was moved from YJ2004 to YJ2002 and YJ2003 by P1 transduction to make YJ2005 and YJ2006, respectively (see Table I).Table IBacterial strains and plasmids usedStrains and plasmidsGenotype or phenotypeSource or Ref.StrainsDY330W3110 ΔlacU169 gal490 λCI857 Δ(cro-bioA)24Yu D.

The PCR mixture contained 250 units of Taq polymerase, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 2 μm of each primer in a total volume of 10 ml. After PCR, the solution containing amplified DNA fragments (about 50 μg/ml) was loaded onto a NeutraAvidin column (Pierce) containing 1 ml of resin. The wild type E. coli strain MC4100 was grown to A600 = 2 in 1 liter of LB medium buffered with 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) in an atmosphere of 80% nitrogen, 10% hydrogen, and 10% carbon dioxide. Cells were harvested and resuspended in the binding buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) and then passed three times through a French press cell at 10,000 pounds/square inch. The extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was loaded onto the column immobilized with the DNA fragments. After agitation on a rotator at room temperature for 20 min, the affinity column was drained and washed with 5 ml of binding buffer twice, and the bound proteins were eluted with 1 ml of 0.1% SDS. The solution containing eluted proteins was freeze-dried and resuspended in 200 μl of deionized water. Then 10 μl of the protein sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In-gel Digestion—The polyacrylamide gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, and the bands of interest were excised from the gel. The gel fragments were destained by incubation in 30–50 μl of 20% isopropyl alcohol for 20 min twice, dehydrated in 50% acetonitrile, and washed with deionized water. The gel fragments were equilibrated in 40 μl of 50% acetonitrile containing 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 15 min twice and reduced with 40 μl of 10 mm DTT containing 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 1 h at 50 °C. Then cysteine residues in proteins were alkylated by incubation in 40 μl of 50 mm iodoacetamide and 100 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature for 40 min in the dark and washed with 20 μlof50% acetonitrile containing 100 mm NH4HCO3 twice. The washed gel fragments were dried in vacuum for 20 min. The polypeptides in the gel fragments were digested by overnight incubation with 200 ng of trypsin in 10 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3. The peptides digested by trypsin were eluted twice with 10 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid containing 50% acetonitrile and concentrated to 4–5 μl in vacuum. MALDI-TOF mass spectra for peptide mapping of tryptic digests were acquired using a Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems Inc.) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Purification and Phosphorylation of ArcA—Primers possessing the synthetic restriction enzyme sites NdeI, located 3 bp upstream from the ATG start codon (in boldface type) (5′-GTTGGCAATTTAGGTAGCACATATGCAG-3′) of the arcA gene, and BamHI, located 8 bp downstream from the TAA stop codon (in boldface type) (5′-TTTTGACGGTGGTGGATCCGATTAATCT-3′), were constructed (restriction sites underlined). By using these primers, the arcA gene from the MG1655 genomic DNA was amplified by PCR. After digestion, the NdeI-BamHI fragment was inserted into the corresponding sites of pRE1 (25Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the recombinant plasmid (pNS200) was electroporated with a Bio-Rad E. coli pulser into E. coli strain GI698 (26Seok Y.-J. Lee B.R. Zhu P.P. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which encodes the gene for the λ repressor under control of the trp promoter. Expression of ArcA was induced by the addition of tryptophan (100 μg/ml) in 1 liter of M9 salts-based rich medium as described previously (10Koo B.-M. Yoon M.-J. Lee C.-R. Nam T.-W. Choe Y.-J.

The cells containing overexpressed ArcA were harvested and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and then passed twice through a French press cell at 10,000 pounds/square inch. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was chromatographed through an FPLC MonoQ 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT) using a gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl. The fractions containing ArcA were concentrated in a Centriprep filter (Millipore) and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 200, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A. The purified ArcA was concentrated to suitable concentration before use. ArcA was phosphorylated using carbamoyl phosphate as the phospho donor as described previously (27Lynch S.A. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carbamoyl phosphate reaction mixture containing the indicated amount of ArcA protein, 50 mm dilithium carbamoyl phosphate, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 125 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 10 μl was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and immediately used for experiments. Gel Retardation Assay—DNA fragments encompassing the promoter region of ptsG and ptsH and the ORF region of ptsG were amplified by PCR using the primers used in the ligand fishing experiments. The promoter of lctPRD was amplified by new primers (5′-CTG GAT CAA CAA CCT AAG GGC AAT TCT CTG-3′ and 5′-ATC TCC TTG TCA CAC GTT GTG TAA AAG TGG-3′). The DNA fragments were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding buffer for electrophoretic mobility shift assay contained 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT and 10% glycerol. Also, each reaction mixture included sonicated herring sperm DNA (Promega) as a nonspecific competitor at the concentration of about 300-fold molar excess over the labeled DNA binding substrate. The binding mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on the 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. In Vitro Transcription Assay—Reactions were done as described by Ryu and Garges (13Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 20-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 3 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.2 mm CTP, 0.02 mm UTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 2 nm supercoiled DNA template, 5–20 nm RNA polymerase, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. Regulator proteins such as CRP and ArcA were added to the reaction as described under “Results.” DNase I Footprinting Analysis—DNA fragment carrying the ptsG promoter region was amplified by PCR using either 5′-end-labeled PG1 or PGR2 (5′-ATAACTTCGCCCGTCTGTTTCACATCG-3′, –248 to –222). The PCR product was purified using polyacrylamide gel. Purified protein(s) and DNA fragment were incubated in 40 μl of in vitro transcription assay buffer. DNase I solution (10 ng of DNase I in 5 μl per reaction) was added to the binding mixture, which was then placed at room temperature for 1 min. DNase I reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of stop solution containing 0.4 m sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in sequencing dye and resolved on 7% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. For the identification of the binding sites of proteins, the sequencing ladder prepared by sequencing the ptsG promoter region using PG1 or PGR2 primer was applied to the gel electrophoresis. Construction of a ptsG-lacZ Fusion and β-Galactosidase Assays—The DNA fragment covering from 363 bp upstream to 77 bp downstream of the ptsG start codon was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CAGGTAACCACCGATGAATTCGCCCGTCTG-3′ (an engineered EcoRI site underlined) and 5′-GCGATAGGCAGTACGGATCCCGGCAGCATC-3′ (an engineered BamHI underlined). The PCR product, digested with EcoRI and BamHI, was inserted into pRS415 (28Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) to make pRSptsG. The sequence of the ptsG insert was verified by sequencing, and the fusion was transferred to λRS45 by in vivo recombination as described previously (28Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage λ carrying the fusion was used to lysogenize MC4100 at low multiplicity, and several independent lysogens were analyzed to obtain a monolysogen (YJ2002). YJ2003 (YJ2002arcA::cat) was constructed by P1 transduction of the Cmr region of YJ2001. Disruption of the arcA gene was confirmed by PCR. After cells were grown in LB media adjusted to pH 7.0 using 20 mm potassium phosphate to the mid-logarithmic growth phase, β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Ligand Fishing Experiment Shows That ArcA Specifically Binds to the Promoter Regions of the pts Operon and the ptsG Gene—We performed ligand fishing experiments to search for a protein factor(s) involved in the regulation of PTS expression by using the promoter regions of ptsG and the pts operon as baits. The DNA fragments encompassing the two promoter regions were amplified to a large quantity (10 ml each) by PCR using biotinylated primers and immobilized onto the NeutraAvidin resin (Pierce). Cell lysate was then mixed with the DNA fragments in the columns, and proteins bound specifically to the two promoters were identified by in-gel digestion and MALDI-TOF analyses (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1, we found that ArcA as well as CRP bound to the two promoter regions, but not to the ORF of ptsG, to a significant level, implying specific binding of these two proteins to the promoter regions. Although it is not surprising that CRP shows specific binding to the two promoters, since its binding sites to the promoters are well characterized (15Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it is intriguing that ArcA binds specifically to the two promoters. To confirm specificity of binding of ArcA to the two promoter regions, we performed gel retardation assays. We used the promoter region of the lctPRD operon, which was shown to interact with ArcA previously (27Lynch S.A. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as a positive control. Electrophoretic mobility shifts were observed when ArcA was incubated with DNA fragments covering the promoter regions of the lct operon, the ptsG gene, and the pts operon, but not with the ptsG ORF (Fig. 2), confirming specific interaction of ArcA with the promoters as shown in Fig. 1. Although both phospho-ArcA (ArcA-P) and dephospho-ArcA showed mobility shifts of the three promoter regions, electrophoretic mobility shifts observed with ArcA-P (Fig. 2A) were greater than its dephosphoform (Fig. 2B), showing general characteristics of DNA binding of ArcA to target promoters (27Lynch S.A. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and indicating that the two forms of ArcA protein may show different effects on transcription from each other. ArcA-P Represses Transcription of ptsG—Although the affinity of ArcA-P to the ptsG promoter was comparable with that of the lctPRD promoter, binding of ArcA-P to the promoter region of the pts operon was much weaker than to the other promoters. Thus we focused on the effect of ArcA on the ptsG expression. E. coli is a typical facultative anaerobe, which implies that the expression of large numbers of genes should be regulated differentially in response to changing respiratory conditions of growth. ArcA has been well characterized as the response regulator of the two-component sensory system regulating gene expression in response to the redox conditions of growth in E. coli (30Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C. Science. 2001; 292: 2314-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). When the quinone electron carriers are reduced, its cognate membrane-bound sensor kinase ArcB autophosphorylates and transfers the phosphoryl group to ArcA (31Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ArcA-P then controls the expression of numerous operons involved in respiratory or fermentative metabolism. Because EIICBGlc mediates the first reaction for the glucose metabolism, we decided to examine whether ArcA-P or its dephospho-form affects expression of the ptsG gene. First, to investigate the effect of arcA deletion on the expression of the ptsG gene encoding the glucose-specific transporter EIICBGlc, we constructed a ptsG-lacZ fusion strain. As shown in Fig. 3, arcA deletion caused an ∼2-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity. Because it is well established that Mlc is the major regulator of the ptsG expression, it was uncertain whether regulation of the ptsG expression by ArcA was an indirect result of the reduced expression of Mlc in the arcA deletion strain. To address this issue, we constructed mlc::TetR derivatives of MC4100 and its arcA mutant, and the expression profile of ptsG-lacZ was examined in these mutant cells grown in LB. The results showed that the 2-fold increase in the ptsG expression by arcA deletion was independent of the regulation by Mlc in that increased ptsG expression in the mlc strain was still doubled by the introduction of arcA mutation. The fact that the presence of a null mutation in arcA leads to an increase in ptsG expression regardless of Mlc suggests that ArcA should be the direct repressor of ptsG. If ArcA is the direct repressor for ptsG expression, it was expected that utilization of glucose might be more significantly inhibited than that of other sugars by overexpression of ArcA. To test this idea, the phenotype of E. coli GI698 strains harboring the ArcA overexpression plasmid pNS200 was compared with cells harboring the control vector pRE1. When ∼5 × 105 cells were spotted, colonies of the E. coli strain GI698 harboring the control vector pRE1 on a glucose-MacConkey agar plate developed a red color about 6 h after incubation at 30 °C. In contrast, growth and color development of colonies of GI698 harboring pNS200 were significantly retarded (Fig. 4). However, growth and color development of the E. coli strain GI698 on MacConkey agar plates with fructose (transported through its own PTS independent of ptsG) or lactose (taken up through lactose permease encoded by lacY) were barely affected by overexpression of ArcA, as expected. These results support that ArcA is the repressor of the ptsG gene. To confirm the inhibitory effect of ArcA on ptsG transcription, the in vitro transcription assay was performed by using the purified components. When RNA polymerase alone was present in the reaction, transcription at the ptsG P1 promoter did not occur (Fig. 5, lane 1). The addition of CRP and cAMP, however, increased the P1 promoter"

The deduced amino acid sequence shows that Atc1p contains an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide and 20 potential sites for N-glycosylation. C. albicans homozygous mutants that lack acid trehalase activity were constructed by gene disruption at the two ATC chromosomal alleles. Analysis of these null mutants shows that Atc1p is localized in the cell wall and is required for growth on trehalose as a carbon source. An Atc1p endowed with acid trehalase activity was obtained by an in vtro transcription-translation coupled system. These results strongly suggest that ATC1 is the structural gene encoding cell wall acid trehalase in C. albicans. Determinations of ATC1 mRNA expression as well as acid trehalase activity in the presence and absence of glucose point out that ATC1 gene is regulated by glucose repression.

The non-reducing disaccharide trehalose (α-d-glucopyranosil α-d-glucopyranoside) has been identified and characterized in a wide variety of organisms ranging from bacteria and fungi to plant and mammals (1Elbein A.D. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1974; 30: 227-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 2Thevelein J.M. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota. 3.

Trehalose plays a set of different functions, depending on the specific biological system analyzed. Thus, in prokaryotes (4Strom A.R. Kaasen I. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), it can be used as an external carbon source (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis) (5Boos W. Ehman U. Forkl H. Klein W.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, in yeasts and fungi, trehalose is mainly used as a reserve carbohydrate as well as a cell protectant against several physiological or environmental types of stress (2Thevelein J.M. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota. 3. Springer Verlag, Berlin1996: 395-414Google Scholar, 3Argüelles J.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 9Wiemken A.

In recent years, biotechnological interest in trehalose has greatly increased, and it is currently used as a stabilizer for a number of foods, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics and as a preservative for frozen embryos (11Richards A.B. Krakowka S. Dexter L.B. Schmid H. Wolterbeek A.P. Waalkens-Berendsen D.H. Shigoyuki A. Kurimoto M. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2002; 40: 871-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).In yeasts, trehalose synthesis takes place in a sequential two-step reaction: trehalose 6-phosphate is synthesized from UDP-glucose and glucose 6-phosphate, a reaction catalyzed by a magnesium-dependent trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (coded by the TPS1 gene). Subsequent dephosphorylation by a specific trehalose phosphatase (coded by the gene TPS2) renders free trehalose (3Argüelles J.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 12Nwaka S. Holzer H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 199-224Google Scholar, 13De Virgilio C. Bürckert N. Bell W. Jëno B. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In turn, hydrolysis of the disaccharide points to ample differences among the species of fungi studied. As a general rule, two different trehalases are present, which differ in location, catalytic properties, and regulation: (i) a cytosolic enzyme, which exhibits maximal activity at neutral pH (7.0) and which is activated by Ca2+ or Mn2+ and regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinases; (ii) an acidic trehalase (optimum pH about 4.5), located inside the vacuoles or associated to the cell wall, whose activity is independent of divalent cations (2Thevelein J.M. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota. 3. Springer Verlag, Berlin1996: 395-414Google Scholar, 12Nwaka S. Holzer H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 199-224Google Scholar, 14Kopp M.

Yeast. 1995; 11: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whereas neutral trehalases (Nth1p) hydrolyze the intracellular pool of trehalose, the role of acid trehalases (Ath1p) remains more elusive. Ath1p appears to be required for growth on exogenous trehalose (16Nwaka S. Mechler B. Holzer H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and its regulation by catabolite repression has been postulated (17Jorge J.A. Polizeli M.T. Thevelein J.M. Terenzi H.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 154: 165-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18San-Miguel P.F. Argüelles J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1200: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis, both kinds of cytosolic and vacuolar trehalases are present (2Thevelein J.M. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota. 3. Springer Verlag, Berlin1996: 395-414Google Scholar, 3Argüelles J.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 10Thevelein J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 42-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in fungi such as Neurospora crassa and Mucor rouxii, acid trehalase activity is linked to the cell wall of ascospores and conidiospores (19Hecker L.I. Sussman A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 592-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lucio A.K. Polizeli M.L. Jorge J.A. Terenzi H.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 182: 9-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Emericella nidulans, an acid trehalase has been purified, and the corresponding treA gene has been cloned, being the TreAp located in the cell wall of conidiospores (21D'Enfert C. Fontaine T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen fungus in humans, which can cause either septicaemic or mucosal infections (22Odds F.C. Candida and Candidosis: A Review and Bibliography, 2nd Ed. Bailliere Tindall, London1988Google Scholar, 23Odds F.C. ASM News. 1994; 60: 313-318Google Scholar, 24De Pauw B.E. Meunier F. Chemotherapy. 1999; 45: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The incidence of candidiasis has dramatically increased in the last few decades, due to the rise of the immunocompromised population (25Coleman D.C. Bennett D.E. Sullivan D.J. Gallagher P.J. Henman M.C. Shanley D.B. Russell R.J. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 19: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Fox J.L. ASM News. 1993; 59: 515-518Google Scholar). Furthermore, C. albicans is a dimorphic organism, which exists as unicellular budding yeast (blastoconidia) or as mycelial structures (hyphae and/or pseudohyphae). Morphological transition has been associated with pathogenicity, and the mycelial forms seem to be predominant during host tissue colonization (22Odds F.C. Candida and Candidosis: A Review and Bibliography, 2nd Ed. Bailliere Tindall, London1988Google Scholar, 27Calderone R.A. Braun P.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sentandreu R. Elorza M.V. Mormeneo S. Sanjuan R. Iranzo M. Vanden Bossche H. Odds F. Kerndge D. Dimorphic Fungi in Biology and Medicine.

Cell. 1997; 90: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). In recent years, trehalose metabolism has been intensively investigated in C. albicans in connection with dimorphism and as a possible contributory factor to its virulence. In this respect, disruption of TPS1 indeed impairs hypha formation and decreases infectivity (30Zaragoza O. Blazquez M.A. Gancedo C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3809-3815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas TPS2 is involved in cell integrity and pathogenicity but is not required for dimorphic transition (31Zaragoza O. De Virgilio C. Ponton J. Gancedo C. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Van Dijck P. De Rop L. Szlufcik K. Van Ael E. Thevelein J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1772-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the neutral trehalase (Ntc1p) lacks a specific role during dimorphism and pathogenicity (33Eck R. Bergmann C. Ziegelbauer K. Schanfeld W. Künkei W. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 4747-4756Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Preliminary enzymatic data suggest that acid trehalase in C. albicans is associated to the external surface (34Ram S.P. Romana L. Shepherd M.G. Sullivan P.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1227-1236PubMed Google Scholar) and is not strictly necessary for serum-induced dimorphism (35Alvarez-Peral F.J. Argüelles J.C. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The whole picture of trehalose biosynthesis and hydrolysis in C. albicans has been filled in by the present paper. We have chosen a sequence-dependent approach to identify ORFs 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; DIG, digoxigenin; RT, reverse transcriptase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; LbMP, L. brevis maltose phosphorylase. 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; DIG, digoxigenin; RT, reverse transcriptase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; LbMP, L. brevis maltose phosphorylase. that have homology with Ath1p of S. cerevisiae by an in silico analysis. From the total ORFs, we identified one that has homology with Ath1p (15Destruelle M. Holzer H. Klionsky D.J. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which we called Atc1p. Atc1p appears to be localized on the cell wall. Disruption of the two ATC copies is not lethal; the atc1Δ/atc1Δ null mutant lacks acid trehalase activity and is unable to grow on trehalose as the sole carbon source. To our knowledge, among yeasts this is the first acid trehalase located as an external cell-linked enzyme.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains, Growth Conditions, and Transformations—The C. albicans and Escherichia coli strains used in this study are listed in Table I. C. albicans cells were grown in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone) (36Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 3-21Google Scholar) or MM medium (0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) supplemented with the appropriate nutrients in amounts specified by Sherman (36Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 3-21Google Scholar) and with the appropriate carbon source (2% glucose or 2% trehalose). YPD, MMD, and MMT media were solidified with 2% agar. C. albicans transformation was performed according to Gietz et al. (37Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α, which was grown routinely in LB medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LBA) when required, was used for plasmid propagation. E. coli was transformed as described by Hanahan (38Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8124) Google Scholar).Table IStrains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceCAI4 (C. albicans)ura3Δ::imm434/ura3Δ::imm434Ref. 41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

Sakuma Y. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 538-540PubMed Google Scholar); total RNA isolation was carried out as previously described (40Ramon A.M. Gil R. Burgal M. Sentandreu R. Valentin E. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmid purification was performed using the FlexiPrep Kit commercial system (Amersham Biosciences). Standard DNA manipulation procedures were followed using standard protocols (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA probes (amplicons JCE12 and JCE35) for Southern analysis were labeled by random primed incorporation of digoxigenin-labeled deoxyuridine triphosphate (DIG-labeled DNA) using a DIG DNA-labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Southern hybridization was performed as described by Ramón et al. (40Ramon A.M. Gil R. Burgal M. Sentandreu R. Valentin E. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DNA and RNA concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance (A260) in a GeneQuant II RNA/DNA calculator spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences).Plasmid Construction for Disruption and Reintegration of the ATC1 Gene—The strategy followed for disrupting the ATC gene was carried out by replacing part of the ORF (from amino acid 29 to 128) with an hisG::URA3::hisG (42Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disruption cassette construction was made by PCR amplification in two steps using genomic DNA as a template. In the first step, an amplicon of 619 bp was obtained using the sense primer JCE3 (CACAGGATCCATAACTTTAGAGTACTCAGG) and the antisense primer JCE5 (CCGTGAGCTCGCATTGCATTTCTTTCTGCC) containing an engineered BamHI (underlined) and SacI restriction site (underlined), respectively, annealing to the ORF. The amplicon obtained (JCE 35) was digested with BamHI and SacI and then subcloned into p5921 (42Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing the hisG::URA3::hisG cassette; the resulting plasmid, which was named pATH41, contained 619 bp of the ORF (positions +1985 to +2602 with respect to the start codon). In the second step, an amplicon of 650 bp of the ORF (positions +238 to +886 with respect to the start codon) was obtained by using the sense primer JCE1 (TCTCAAGCTTGAGCAATTAGTCAATAGTCC) and the antisense primer JCE2 (CACACTGCAGCAGAAACAATGACTTGTACG) containing engineered restriction sites HindIII and PstI, respectively (underlined). The amplicon obtained (JCE12) was ligated into the HindIII and PstI sites of pATH41 to create plasmid pATH51 in which 1100 bp (29%) of the coding region were deleted.To reintegrate the ATC1 gene into the genome of the mutant strain, ATC2-2, an integrative plasmid, using CIp10-MAL2p (43Backen A.C. Broadbent I.D. Fetherson R.W. Rosamond J.D.C. Schnell N.F. Stark M.J.R. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was constructed. The construction of a derivative of CIp10-MAL2p, in which the ATC1 gene was placed under the control of the MAL2 promoter, was as follows. The ATC1 open reading frame was obtained by PCR amplification using genomic DNA as template, and the sense primer YEJ3 (CACAGATATCATGTGTTTAGCTAATTTATTCC) and the antisense primer YEJ2 (CACAACGCGTATTTACTTTTAATAAAAAACAACTTCAGC) containing engineered restriction sites EcoRV and MluI, respectively (underlined). The amplicon obtained (YEJ32) was ligated into the EcoRV and MluI sites of CIp10-MAL2p to create plasmid CIpMAL2p-ATC1.To target integration of CIp10MAL2p-ATC1 to the C. albicans RP10 locus, it was first digested with NcoI, which cuts plasmid uniquely within the RP10 sequence. Digested plasmid was used to transform C. albicans atc1Δ null mutant.Isolation of ATC1 Null Mutant—Disruption of ATC1 was achieved as described by Fonzi and Irwin (42Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. albicans CAI4 cells were transformed into Ura+ prototrophy with 10 μg of an HindIII/SacI fragment from plasmid pATH51. Transformed cells were selected as Ura+ in an MMD medium lacking uridine and checked for integration of the cassette at the ATC1 locus by Southern blot analysis. One of the heterozygous disruptants recovered (designated C. albicans ATC1-1) was used to select spontaneous Ura- derivatives in MMD medium containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid (44Boeke J.D. Lacroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). These clones were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization to identify those that had undergone intrachromosomal recombination between hisG repeats. One of these Ura- derivatives (termed C. albicans ATC1-2) was used for replacement of the second ATC1 allele in a similar way, using the HindIII/SacI fragment from plasmid pATH51. Transformed cells were selected as Ura+, and integration into the correct allele was verified by Southern blot analysis. One of these Ura+ transformants (designated C. albicans ATC2-1) was used for 5-fluoro-orotic acid selection to Ura- auxotrophy. Ura- segregants were screened by Southern blot analysis using digestion with BglII to identify those carrying both disrupted ATC1 alleles. One of these ATC1 null mutants was designated C. albicans ATC2-2.Cell Wall Purification and Solubilization of Wall Proteins—To purify cell walls, washed cells were resuspended in a small volume of cold 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Glass beads were added in a proportion of 1.5 g/mg of dry cells, and the mixture was vortexed at room temperature for eight periods of 1 min each with intermediate periods of 1 min on ice. Using this method, the whole cell population was broken up, as monitored in the phase-contrast microscope. The purification procedure was continued by repeated washing of the cell wall pellet in cold phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). The pellet was collected and operationally defined as the cell wall.Conditions for the solubilization of cell wall proteins with SDS or zymolyase 20T have been described (45Pastor F.I.J. Valentin E. Herrero E. Sentandreu R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 292-300Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 46Valentin E. Herrero E. Pastor F.I.J. Sentandreu R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1419-1428Google Scholar); growth media and β-mercaptoethanol extracts were obtained as previously described (47Casanova M. Gil M.L. Cardeñoso L. Martinez J.P. Sentandreu R. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 262-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Elorza M.V. Marcilla A. Sentandreu R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2393-2403PubMed Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE performed basically as described by Laemmli (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) on SDS-8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. For Western blot analysis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto nitrocellulose filters (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham Biosciences), according to Towbin et al. (50Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). Filters were probed with rabbit antibodies against a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to 15 amino acid residues (DLDPDSFKTADDVLK, from amino acids 342–356) of Atc1p at a dilution of 1:500 (pAb-Yol1), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Synthetic oligopeptide and pAb-Yol1 were purchased from Gramsch Laboratories (Germany). Antiserum binding was visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence fluorescent labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was recorded by exposing the filter to a radioautographic X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.).RT-PCR—Oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA derived from C. albicans CAI4, growing on glucose or trehalose as a carbon source, using the SuperScript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The sense and antisense primers were JCE3 and JCE7 (GCATTCAGATATGCTATCAGGG), respectively; this combination of primers specifically amplified a 685-bp amplicon. As an approximate confirmation of the relative quantity of total cDNA in each sample, primers EFB1F (ATTGAACGAATTCTTGGCTGAC) and EFB1R (CATCTTCTTCAACAGCAGCTTG) were added to each PCR; this pair of primers specifically amplified a 526-bp fragment of EFB from C. albicans (58Maneu V.E. Cervera A.M. Martinez J.P. Gozalbo D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 157-162PubMed Google Scholar). Since EFB contains an intron, primers EFB1F and EFB1R also served as control to confirm that samples had no genomic DNA contamination (an amplicon of 890 bp appeared if this was the case). All samples contained the same quantity of first strand cDNA (1 μg). PCR was performed as follows: EcoTaq polymerase (2 units; Ecogen) was added to 49.4 μl of a solution consisting of 16.6 mm (NH4)2SO4; 2.5 mm MgCl2; 67 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8); 0.2 mm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 0.3 μm each primers JCE3, JCE7, EFB1F, and EFB1R; and 1 μg of cDNA. Amplification was performed in a PCR thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Gene Amp PCR System 2400) by using one cycle at 94 °C for 5 min and then 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30 cycles as follows: 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 50 °C, and 1 min of primer extension at 72 °C. Amplicons obtained in different cycles were run on 2% agarose gel.Preparation of Cell-free Extracts and Enzymic Assays—Cell-free extracts were obtained and acid trehalase activity was determined as described elsewhere (18San-Miguel P.F. Argüelles J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1200: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell samples were harvested and washed and were resuspended at known densities (10–15 mg ml-1, wet weight) in 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After vigorous shaking in a vortex for 5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer at initial density.Acid trehalase was assayed by incubating 50 μl of cell wall pellet with 200 μl of 200 mm trehalase prepared in 200 mm sodium citrate containing 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by heating in a water bath at 100 °C for 5 min. Glucose was measured in the supernatants by the glucose oxidase-peroxidase procedure (18San-Miguel P.F. Argüelles J.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Specific activity is expressed as nmol of glucose liberated min-1 (mg of protein)-1.Homology Model for ATC1 from C. albicans—The predicted amino acid sequence (residues 1–1019 of the mature protein) of the C. albicans Atc1 protein was submitted to the JIGSAW 3D Protein Homology Modeling Server (available on the World Wide Web at www.bmm.icnet.uk/servers/3djigsaw) (51Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. Suppl. 1999; 3: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The JIGSAW server returned the Lactobacillus brevis maltose phosphorylase structure, Protein Data Bank code 1H54 (52Egloff M.P. Uppenberg J. Haalck L. van Tildeurgh H. Structure. 2001; 9: 689-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), as the only successful structural template within its sample space. To better model the Atc1p, the sequence was divided into two 800-amino acid overlapping blocks, which were submitted to the 3D-PSSM server (available on the World Wide Web at www.sbg.bio.ic.uk/servers/3dpssm) (53Kelley L.A. McCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar).In Vitro Synthesis of Acid Trehalase—The in vitro transcription-translation coupled system (Rapid Translation System RTS 100 E. coli HY Kit; Roche Applied Science) was utilized for the synthesis of acid trehalase from the PCR-amplified ATC1 gene carrying the T7 promoter sequence. To generate linear DNA, two PCRs were performed using the Linear Template Generation Set, HA tag (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions and the specific primers ATC-N-FOR (CTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACCATGTGTTTAGCTAATTTATTCC) and ATC-N-REV (ATCGTATGGGTAGCTGGTCCCATAAAAAACAACTTCAGCTAG), which allow amplification of the entire, HA-tagged, ATC1 gene.Protein synthesis was produced using the RTS100 E. coli HY Kit (Roche Applied Science). Reactions were performed mainly according to the manufacturer's manual, using ∼200 ng of DNA per reaction. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 6 h. The resulting lysates were directly used for the acid trehalase assay. To act as a control, GFP was synthesized according to the manufacturer's recipe.RESULTSIn Silico Screening for Potential Acid Trehalases in C. albicans—Taking as template the acid trehalase from S. cerevisiae (Ath1p), a C. albicans genome data base (available on the World Wide Web at genolist.pasteur.fr/CandidaDB/) was blasted. One ORF protein (IPF 19760/CA2574) was found and presented a significant homology with the S. cerevisiae Ath1p. Comparison of the amino acid sequence with the sequences found in protein data bases using the BLAST search algorithm (54Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar) revealed a significant homology with both the S. cerevisiae Ath1p and E. nidulans TreAp (Fig. 1). CA2574 shares 41% identical and 59% similar amino acids with Ath1p and 29% identical and 47% similar amino acids with TreAp, both comparisons being made over their entire length. These results suggest that IPF 19760 could encode C. albicans acid trehalase, for which reason we called it Atc1p (for acid trehalase of Candida albicans).Structural Analysis of the Amino Acid Sequence Encoded by ATC1—The ORF encodes a putative polypeptide of 1040 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 116,260 and a pI of 4.81. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed an N-terminal region with characteristics of a signal peptide (55Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar) and a predicted cleavage site between positions 22 and 23 (... CSG↓AP) (Fig. 2B). Hydropathy analysis (56Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16999) Google Scholar) of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that the hydrophobic signal sequence is followed by a neutral region representing the mature protein (Fig. 2A). Assuming the cleavage site is at position 22, the mature protein has 1019 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 113.7 kDa. Nineteen potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) were identified at amino acid positions 113, 147, 205, 250, 264, 313, 495, 554, 564, 624, 633, 792, 800, 867, 885, 894, 909, 966, and 1000. The difference between the predicted size of Atc1p (113.7 kDa) and the size deduced from the motility in SDS-PAGE (170 kDa) (Fig. 5) can be accounted for by glycosylation of one or more of the potential N-glycosylation sites.Fig. 2A, hydropathic plot from the deduced amino acid sequence of Atc1p.

Caveolae/rafts are specialized lipid compartments that have been implicated in insulin signaling. In the present study, we investigated the role of caveolin-enriched membrane domains (CMD) in mediating insulin signaling in rat liver. We report the existence of at least two different populations of CMD in rat liver plasma membranes (PM). One population is soluble in Triton X-100 and seems to be constitutively associated with cytoskeletal elements. The other population of CMD is located in a membrane compartment insoluble in Triton X-100 with light buoyant density and is hence designated CMD/rafts. We found evidence of rapid actin reorganization in rat liver PM in response to insulin, along with the association of CMD/rafts and insulin signaling molecules with a cell fraction enriched in cytoskeletal elements. The presence of CMD in liver parenchyma cells was confirmed by the presence of caveolin-1 in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. Cholesterol depletion, effected by incubating hepatocytes with 2 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin, did not permeabilize the cells or interfere with clathrin-dependent internalization. However, at this concentration, methyl-β-cyclodextrin perturbed CMD of hepatocyte PM and inhibited insulin-induced Akt activation and glycogen synthesis but did not affect insulin-induced insulin receptor kinase tyrosine phosphorylation. These events, together with the presence of a functional insulin receptor in CMD of rat liver PM, suggest that insulin signaling is influenced by the interaction of caveolae with cytoskeletal elements in liver.

Although binding of insulin to its receptor is a process specific to high affinity, the signaling cascades generated by the activated insulin receptor kinase (IRK) 1The abbreviations used are: IRK, insulin receptor kinase; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; CMD, caveolin-1-enriched membrane domains; PM, plasma membranes; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DRM, detergent resistant membranes; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; Tf, transferrin; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; p85, regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase. are shared by a number of other growth factors (1Pignataro O.P.

The mechanism by which insulin achieves its specificity of action remains to be satisfactorily determined. Compartmentalization of signaling molecules in plasma membranes and endosomes may play an important role in determining the specificity of signal transduction (4Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.J.

The recent isolation of detergent-insoluble, low-density membrane fragments from cells suggests that sphingolipid and cholesterol rich domains could exist as a liquid-ordered phase in the membrane (8Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar). These lipid domains, known as lipid rafts, can recruit or exclude signaling proteins. Thus, lipid rafts have been implicated in the regulation of hormone and growth factor signaling (8Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 9Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar). Caveolae, which constitute a subset of lipid rafts, are invaginated cell surface microdomains that are enriched in caveolin oligomers, the major protein constituent of these structures (10Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 11Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Three caveolins (caveolin-1, -2, and -3) have been discovered. Caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 are found most abundantly in adipocyte and endothelial cells, whereas caveolin-3 is found in muscle cells. Caveolae have been implicated in potocytosis, transcytosis, endocytosis independent of clathrin, and signal transduction (11Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 12Bickel P.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E1-E10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that caveolae negatively affect epidermal growth factor and Src signaling (13Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). In contrast to these inhibitory effects, a number of studies, mostly in adipocytes, have suggested that intact caveolae are necessary for insulin signaling. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, IRK was reported to be concentrated in caveolae (14Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.E. Stralfors P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and to interact with caveolin-1 to modulate insulin signaling (15Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G.

Rafts/caveolae have also been implicated in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by a mechanism independent of PI3-kinase (19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C.

Caveolin-1 knockout mice have been created that are viable despite a complete ablation of caveolae (21Razani B. Lisanti M.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1553-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These mice show impaired nitric oxide signaling, vascular dysfunction, hyperproliferation of endothelial cells, abnormalities in lipid homeostasis, insulin resistance, and decreased insulin receptor expression in adipose tissue (21Razani B.

These observations suggest that caveolae in adipocytes can contribute to both the strength and specificity of insulin signaling. There is a paucity of data concerning the role of caveolae on insulin signaling in other insulin-responsive tissues. Although liver contains a lower level of caveolin-1 than that in adipocytes, it has nevertheless clearly been shown that caveolin-1 is located in liver parenchymal cells, with negligible levels detected in endothelial cells (24Pol A. Calvo M. Lu A. Enrich C. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Calvo M. Tebar F. Lopez-Iglesias C. Enrich C. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1259-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolae have been demonstrated at the cell surface of hepatocytes using rapid-freeze, deep-etching electron microscopy (25Calvo M. Tebar F. Lopez-Iglesias C. Enrich C. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1259-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because liver is an important insulin target tissue, we investigated the significance of caveolin-enriched membrane domains (CMD) in mediating insulin signaling in rat liver. In the present study, we have characterized these entities and have demonstrated a possible function in insulin signaling. Animals—Female Sprague-Dawley rats, 10 weeks of age, (160–180 g body weight) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Canada Ltd. (St. Constant, PQ, Canada), housed in an animal facility with 12-h light cycles at 25 °C and fed ad libitum on Purina chow. Animals were fasted overnight (16–18 h) before each study. Materials—Porcine insulin was a gift from Eli Lilly and Co., (Indianapolis, IN). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Reagents for electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. Kodak X-OMAT AR film was from Picker International (Montreal, PQ, Canada). Polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P transfer membranes were from Millipore Ltd. (Mississauga, ON, Canada). [U-14C]glucose (300 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280) were from Dynal (Lake Success, NY). An antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 942–969 of the juxtamembrane region of the IRK β-subunit (anti-960) was prepared and purified on a protein A-Sepharose column as described previously (26Burgess J.W. Wada I. Ling N. Khan M.N. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10077-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of IRK, an antibody directed against the α-subunit was obtained from the serum of a patient with acanthosis nigricans (27Khan M.N. Baquiran G. Brule C. Burgess J. Foster B. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12931-12940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-p85, a polyclonal anti-IRS1 antibody, and a specific antibody against Akt2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies against Akt1 and phospho-Akt1 (Ser473) were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Mississauga, ON, Canada). An antibody against actin and iron-saturated transferrin was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). A monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-caveolin-1 was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—Rats were anesthetized and sacrificed by decapitation at the indicated times after intrajugular injections as described in the appropriate figure legends. Livers were exsanguinated, rapidly excised, and minced at scissor-point in ice-cold buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, and 2 mm Na3VO4). Plasma membranes (PM), endosomes, and microsomes were prepared as described previously (27Khan M.N. Baquiran G. Brule C. Burgess J. Foster B. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12931-12940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A purified Golgi fraction prepared as described previously (28Bergeron J.J. Kotwal G.J. Levine G. Bilan P. Rachubinski R. Hamilton M. Shore G.C. Ghosh H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Bergeron. The protein content of these fractions was measured using a modification of Bradford's method with bovine serum albumin as standard (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Isolation of Caveolin-enriched Membrane Domains (CMD)—Isolation of CMD with Triton X-100 was accomplished as follows. CMD were isolated by a modification of the method of Liu et al. (30Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In brief, plasma membranes were pelleted and mixed with 3 ml of ice-cold 1% Triton-X100 in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm Na3VO4). The samples were homogenized (10 strokes in a glass homogenizer), incubated on ice for 1 h, adjusted to the same amount of protein, and diluted 1:1 with 80% sucrose in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). The extract (4 ml, between 2 and 5 mg of protein) was loaded on the bottom of a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with 4 ml each of 30 and 10% sucrose in buffer B. The gradient was centrifuged for 21 h at 29,000 × g in a SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments), and 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the tube. Fractions 1–8 (10–30% sucrose gradient), fraction 9 (soluble proteins in the residual 40% sucrose layer), and the pellet, re-suspended in 1 ml of ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The amount of protein recovered in the detergent-resistant membranes (DRM)/lipid raft fraction (fractions 4 and 5 of sucrose gradient) and in the Triton-insoluble pellet was between 20 and 100 μg and 400 and 700 μg, respectively. Alternatively, CMD was isolated with a detergent-free method. In brief, PM was mixed with 3 ml of ice-cold Na2CO3 (200 mm, pH 11) in buffer A. Samples were homogenized (10 strokes in a glass homogenizer), sonicated (3 times, 10 s each), and incubated on ice for 1 h. Thereafter, samples were mixed with 80% sucrose, centrifuged overnight, and collected as indicated above. Finally, in some experiments, PM were homogenized in 1% Triton X-100 and Na2CO3 (pH 11; final concentration, 200 mm) in buffer A. After incubating on ice for 1 h, the samples were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose (1:1) and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation as described above. Immunoblotting—Fractions 1–8 (100 μl each) from the sucrose gradients were mixed with 50 μlof3× Laemmli sample buffer subjected to SDS-PAGE (6–12% gel) and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes for immunoblotting. In some experiments, proteins from these fractions were concentrated with trichloroacetic acid (30Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and dissolved in 100 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer. The Triton-insoluble pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS buffer, mixed with 500 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer, and aliquots of 100 μl were used for SDS-PAGE. 50 μgof protein from fraction 9 and total PM were used for SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-1 antibody showed a nonspecific band at 29 kDa when total membranes or fraction 9 were analyzed. This band was absent in the Triton-insoluble pellet and in lipid rafts. Either I125GAR or I125GAM were used as secondary antibodies and, after autoradiography at –80 °C, appropriate bands were quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer. Immunoisolation of CMDs—PM was homogenized in Na2CO3, pH11 (10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer), and incubated on ice for 1 h followed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant pellet was again homogenized and then sonicated (three times, 10 s each) in Tris-buffered saline (buffer B) containing proteases inhibitors and 1% albumin as noted above. The treatment with Na2CO3 was carried out to remove PM filaments, which could interfere with the immunoisolation process. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280) were coated with a specific antibody against caveolin-1 or with IgG (negative control) as specified by the manufacturer. Coated beads were incubated with PM for 2 h at 4 °C, resuspend and washed four times with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, before boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjecting to SDS-PAGE. Cell Culture—Primary hepatocytes, isolated from 120–140-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Inc.) by in situ liver perfusion with collagenase, were plated on a collagen matrix (Vitrogen-100). Subconfluent cultures were prepared by seeding 1 × 106 cells, onto 9.6-cm2 6-well plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) or 5 × 106 cells, onto 78 cm2 culture dishes (Starstedt Canada, St. Laurent, PQ, Canada). Cells were bathed for 24 h in seeding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaHCO3, 500 IU/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml streptomycin) and then for 48 h in serum-free medium that differed from the seeding medium in that it lacked FBS and contained 1.25 μg/ml Fungizone, 0.4 mm ornithine, 2.25 μg/ml l-lactic acid, 2.5 × 10–8m selenium, and 1 × 10–8m ethanolamine. Fresh serum-free media was added just before incubation of hepatocytes with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Detection of IRK located at the cell surface of the hepatocytes was performed as described previously (31Levy-Toledano R. Caro L.H. Hindman N. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1803-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In brief, hepatocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of MβCD and insulin as noted in the figure legends. Thereafter, hepatocytes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS-Ca-Mg, pH 7.4 (0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2), and cell surface proteins were biotinylated by incubation with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in PBS-Ca-Mg for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by washing the dishes three times with PBS-Ca-Mg containing 15 mm glycine. After biotinylation, cell lysates were prepared as described above, and IRK was immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the α-subunit of the IRK. Immunoprecipitates were boiled in the presence of Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and immunoblotted with α 960 or Streptavidin-HRP (Amersham Biosciences). Streptavidin binds to biotinylated proteins allowing only the detection of IRK associated with the PM. Transferrin Uptake in Primary Hepatocytes—Transferrin (Tf) internalization in primary hepatocytes was performed as described previously (32Runnegar M. Wei X. Berndt N. Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, hepatocytes were preincubated in the presence or absence of 2 mm MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C, and then 1 μgof 125I-Tf (around 2 μCi) was added. Iron-saturated Tf was labeled with 125I with the Chloramine-T method as described previously (33McConahey P.J. Dixon F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After incubation at the indicated times at 37 °C, cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS, incubated for 30 s with 250 mm acetic acid containing 500 mm NaCl followed by neutralization with 1 m NaAc, and washed again three times in ice-cold PBS. Cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, and intracellular radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter and normalized to the protein content. Specific incorporation of Tf into the hepatocytes was the difference between the binding 125I-Tf minus the binding 125I-Tf plus 400 μg of non-labeled iron saturated transferrin. Glycogen Synthesis—Glycogen synthesis was determined by incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into glycogen as described previously (34Lavoie L. Band C.J. Kong M. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28279-28285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, hepatocytes (1 × 106 cells) were serum-deprived for 4 h, pre-incubated in the absence or presence of 2 mm MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C, and subsequently incubated for 2 h in serum-free media containing 15 mm [U-14C]glucose and insulin (100 nm), in the absence of MβCD. Incubations were stopped by three rapid washes with ice-cold PBS, and cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH. The samples were then boiled in the presence of 2 mg of carrier glycogen and precipitated overnight in 70% ethanol at –20 °C. After centrifugation, the precipitated glycogen was resuspended in 500 μl of water, incubated for 5 min at 70 °C, and incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Caveolin-1 Distribution in Rat Liver Subcellular Fractions— Caveolin-1 has been observed to be largely localized to the plasma membrane of selected cell types, in 50- to 100-nm Ω-shaped invaginations termed caveolae (10Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 11Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). These caveolin-enriched microdomains are characterized by their light buoyant density and resistance to solubilization by Triton X-100 at 4 °C (10Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 11Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the distribution of caveolin-1 in rat liver subcellular fractions by immunoblotting the various fractions using a specific antibody against this protein. As shown in Fig. 1a, caveolin-1 was detected principally in PM and microsomes and was barely detectable in endosomes or Golgi fractions. Isolation of CMD from Rat Liver PM with Triton X-100 —We subsequently analyzed the distribution of caveolin-1 in rat liver PM after incubation of PM preparations with 1% Triton X-100 and subsequent sucrose gradient flotation analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Caveolin-1 was found in the Triton X-100 insoluble pellet and at the 10–30% sucrose interface (Fig. 2a, left, fractions 4 and 5), which constituted DRM with a buoyant density characteristic of lipid rafts (DRM/rafts). When corrected for protein content in each fraction, approximately 60% of caveolin-1 was found in the pellet, 10% in DRM/rafts at the 10–30% sucrose interface, and the remainder was solubilized as indicated by its presence in the load zone (fraction 9) beneath the sucrose gradient (Fig. 3d, white bars). Caveolin-1 was enriched in the pellet and the DRM/rafts (10–30% sucrose interface) by 11- and 7-fold, respectively, relative to the original PM lysate.Fig. 3Characterization of CMDs in rat liver PM. Rats were fasted overnight and liver PM was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PM preparations were re-suspended in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors and divided into three equal aliquots. These aliquots were homogenized in presence of 1% Triton X-100 (a), Na2CO3, pH 11 (b), and the combination of 1% Triton X-100 and Na2 CO3, pH 11 (c). These homogenates were placed at the bottom of a centrifuge tube and processed as described in Fig. 2. Fractions 1–8 and fraction 9 correspond to the 10–30% sucrose gradient and the soluble proteins of the 40% sucrose layer, respectively. The pellet was re-suspended in 1 ml of PBS. Each of the 9 fractions and the re-suspended pellet were subjected to SDS-PAGE (6–12%) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-1 and anti-actin antibodies. A representative immunoblot of the three different solubilization conditions is depicted. The volume of each fraction and the volume loaded for SDS-PAGE are shown at the bottom of c. Bands were quantified by scanning densitometry and normalized to the total amount of caveolin-1 and actin in each fraction. The amount of caveolin-1 (d) and actin (e) are expressed as a percentage of the total amount in the original PM lysate (% total). Each point is the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. The protein content in each fraction is shown in f. WB, Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PM fractions we prepared have been characterized in detail and seem to be quite pure, although there is some contamination with endoplasmic reticulum (35Hubbard A.L. Wall D.A. Ma A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Microsomes contain both caveolin-1 (Figs. 1a and 2a, right) and abundant endoplasmic reticulum elements. Therefore, it is possible that a substantial portion of PM caveolin-1 is a result of contamination with microsomes. We therefore subjected microsomes treated with Triton X-100 to sucrose gradient fractionation and compared caveolin-1 distribution from this compartment (Fig. 2a, right) with that from PM. Caveolin-1 from microsomes was found in DRM/rafts and in the soluble fraction (fraction 9). In contrast to PM, no caveolin-1 was found in the Triton-insoluble pellet from microsomes (Fig. 2a, right), indicating a different distribution of caveolin-1 in these two compartments. To further compare the DRM/rafts from PM with those from microsomes, we subjected them to SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining. As seen in Fig. 2c, the DRM/rafts from PM displayed a protein pattern distinctly different from that observed in those isolated from microsomes, indicating their distinction from one another. Caveolin-1 and the PM Cytoskeleton—It has been noted previously that the PM preparation used in our work contains abundant filaments (35Hubbard A.L. Wall D.A. Ma A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 36Hubbard A.L. Ma A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, after treatment of the PM with Triton X-100 and subsequent centrifugation, the filamentous structures in the resultant pellet were found to be enriched in actin (36Hubbard A.L. Ma A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In our study, we found that actin was enriched only in the PM fraction, and not microsomes, Golgi, or endosomes, relative to its concentration in whole liver homogenate (Fig. 1b, compare lanes H and PM). When the distribution of actin was analyzed in PM subfractions, resolved by sucrose density centrifugation, we found that, as with caveolin-1 (Fig. 2b, left), actin was enriched in the pellet and the DRM/rafts (10–30% sucrose interface) by 5- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to the original PM lysate. We also found in microsomes that actin, in parallel with caveolin-1 distribution, was found in DRM/rafts and the soluble proteins of fraction 9, whereas none was found in the pellet (Fig. 2b, right). These results suggest that the PM microdomains containing caveolin-1 also contain insoluble actin-rich structures, perhaps in association with one another. Characterization of CMD in Rat Liver PM—CMD have also been prepared by treating membranes with Na2CO3, pH 11 (37Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

In cells protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) mostly binds to a scaffold subunit (A subunit or PR65); however, PP2Ac alternatively binds to α-4, a subunit related to yeast Tap42 protein, which also associates with phosphatases PP4 or PP6. We mapped α-4 binding to PP2Ac to the helical domain, residues 19-165. We mutated selected residues and transiently expressed epitope-tagged PP2Ac to assay for association with A and α-4 subunits by co-precipitation. The disabling H118N mutation at the active site or the presence of the active site inhibitor microcystin-LR did not interfere with binding of PP2Ac to either the A subunit or α-4, showing that these are allosteric regulators. Positively charged side chains Lys41, Arg49, and Lys74 on the back surface of PP2Ac are unique to PP2Ac, compared with phosphatases PP4, PP6, and PP1. Substitution of one, two, or three of these residues with Ala produced a progressive loss of binding to the A subunit, with a corresponding increase in binding to α-4. Conversely, mutation of Glu42 in PP2Ac essentially eliminated PP2Ac binding to α-4, with an increase in binding to the A subunit. Reciprocal changes in binding because of mutations indicate competitive distribution of PP2Ac between these regulatory subunits and demonstrate that the mutated catalytic subunits retained a native conformation. Furthermore, neither the Lys41-Arg49-Lys74 nor Glu42 mutations affected the phosphatase-specific activity or binding to microcystin-agarose. Binding of PP2Ac to microcystin and to α-4 increased with temperature, consistent with an activation energy barrier for these interactions. Our results reveal that the A subunit and α-4 (mTap42) require charged residues in separate but overlapping surface regions to associate with the back side of PP2Ac and modulate phosphatase activity.

Protein Ser/Thr phosphatases of the type-1 and type-2A classes are essential enzymes similar in terms of structure and catalytic mechanism but with distinctive and multifaceted roles in eucaryotic cells (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ceulemans H.

The catalytic subunits have an extraordinarily conserved central domain of ∼250 residues that forms a bimetallic active site for phosphoester hydrolysis.

Differences in potency among inhibitors for PP1 and PP2A have been attributed to sequence differences in the β-12-13 loop at the edge of the active site (5Zhang Z. Zhao S. Long F. Zhang L. Bai G.

The N- and C-terminal segments outside the central catalytic domain were not visualized in the structure, probably because of their flexibility. These segments diverge in sequence between type-1 and type-2A phosphatases and also among the isoforms of each type (9Shima H. Hatano Y. Chun Y.-S. Sugimura T. Zhang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with reduction in phosphatase activity. In addition, the C-terminal Leu309 in PP2A undergoes reversible methylesterification, which affects association with regulatory subunits (19Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Bryant J.C. Westphal R.S. Wadzinski B.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Association with multiple regulatory subunits is considered the basis for achieving diversity of biological functions and modulation of enzymatic activity for both PP1 and PP2A. The monomeric catalytic subunits are highly active and exhibit relatively broad and overlapping reactivity with phosphoproteins (21Ingebritsen T.W. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Regulatory subunits restrict and control activity, target the phosphatase to structures such as glycogen particles or myofibrils, and also serve as scaffolds for substrates and kinases (22Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, one key to understanding PP1 and PP2A is to understand their distribution among regulatory subunits. The PP1 catalytic subunit directly binds to many different regulatory subunits. A RVXF motif common to most PP1 regulatory subunits is the primary basis for recognition (23Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24Egloff M. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition PP1 is selectively inhibited with nanomolar potency by phosphoproteins, such as inhibitor-1, DARPP-32, CPI-17, and inhibitor-2 (26Shenolikar S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Eto M. Leach C. Tountas N.A. Brautigan D.L. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 366: 243-260PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results show that PP1 can bind both a regulatory subunit and an inhibitor protein simultaneously (28Conner J.H. Weiser D.C. Li S. Hallenbeck J.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell.

Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4690-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast to PP1, most PP2A binds directly to one regulatory subunit, called A or PR65. In this AC dimer the A subunit functions to alter the kinetics of C, in particular reducing the catalytic rate over 20-fold (33Turowski P. Favre B. Campbell K.S. Lamb N.J.C. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Price N.E. Mumby M.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11312-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and also acts as a molecular scaffold to mediate binding of various regulatory B subunits to form different ABC trimeric PP2A. There are more than a dozen B subunits in three different families, providing considerable diversity (35Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Lickteig R. Yang S.I. Craft C. Mumby M. J. Biol.

Tumor antigens such as SV40 small t and polyoma middle T bind to the AC dimer in place of the B subunits (39Walter G. Ferre F. Espiritu O. Carbone-Wiley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Miller T.B. Brautigan D.L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Mutations in the A subunit gene appear in lung and colon cancers, underscoring the importance of this subunit in the function of PP2A (42Wang S.S. Esplin E.D. Li J.L. Huange L. Gazdar A. Minna J. Evans G.A. Science. 1998; 282: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Other more recent results have expanded the distribution of the A and PP2Ac subunits to other partners. The A subunit was found by two-hybrid analysis to associate with HSF2, a heat shock transcription factor (43Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12967-12970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Binding of HSF2 to the A subunit only occurred when the PP2Ac was displaced, posing alternative functions for the A subunit protein separate from PP2A. The A subunit also was reported to bind to the TPR repeats in PP5, a protein phosphatase with a sequence related to both PP1 and PP2A (44Lubert E.J. Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38582-38587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations indicated that PP2Ac simultaneously bound to both the A subunit and eRF1, a release factor for translation termination (45Andjelkovic N. Zolnierowicz S. Van Hoof C. Goris J. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7156-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, either PP2Ac or AC dimer associates with the cytoplasmic domains of CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors (46Chuang E. Fisher T.S. Morgan R.W. Robbins M.D. Duerr J.M. Vander Heiden M.G. Gardner J.P. Hambor J.E. Neveu M.J. Thompson C.B. Immunity. 2000; 13: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The PP2Ac also directly binds to the protein α-4, which is related in sequence to the yeast protein Tap42 that binds yeast phosphatases Sit4 or Pph21/22 and functions downstream of target of rapamycin (TOR) in a signaling pathway sensitive to nutrient availability (47Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). α-4 was first cloned using a monoclonal antibody against a phosphoprotein associated with the α chain of the B cell receptor complex (48Inui S. Sanjo H. Maeda K. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 1998; 92: 539-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Inui S. Kuwahara K. Mizutani J. Maeda K. Kawai T. Nakayasu H. Sakaguchi N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2714-2723PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of α-4 to PP2Ac occurs with displacement of the A subunit, so the two regulatory subunits are mutually exclusive (50Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, unlike the A subunit that binds only to PP2Ac, the α-4 subunit also binds the related phosphatases PP4 and PP6 (51Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 247: 827-832Google Scholar). We sought to define surface determinants in PP2Ac for binding to the A subunit and α-4 that would account for specific recognition but mutually exclusive association. Recombinant forms of PP2Ac (and PP1c) have been notoriously difficult to express, and recombinant catalytic subunits exhibit properties different from the native enzymes (52Watanabe T. Huang H.-B. Horiuchi A. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Heish-Wilson L. Allen P.B. Shenolikar S. Greengard P. Nairn A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3080-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, using binding assays with purified subunits was not a feasible approach. Besides, it may be more informative to assay for subunit association in living cells, with the other partners for each of the subunits present and competing for interaction. Transient expression of PP2Ac in mammalian cells is under stringent regulation at transcriptional and translational levels (53Baharians Z. Schonthal A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19019-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 54Chung H. Brautigan D.L. Cell. Signalling. 1999; 11: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), limiting the amount of ectopic protein expressed. This affords conditions where ectopic PP2Ac is expressed at low levels relative to endogenous PP2A. Here we used expression of wild type and mutated epitope-tagged PP2Ac and co-immunoprecipitation with endogenous subunits or co-expressed tagged subunits. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Full-length murine α-4 was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of the pGBT10 vector (donated by Ian Macara, University of Virginia). The pGBT10 is a derivative of pGBT9 containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The library was 9-day mouse embryo cDNA size-selected for fragments of 350-700 nucleotides that were inserted into the NotI site in pVP16, downstream of the GAL4 activation domain (obtained from Stan Hollenberg, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). The two-hybrid screen was done in a sequential manner with ∼6 × 106 independent clones screened by plating onto synthetic medium (Difco) containing 10 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma) and lacking the amino acids histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Positives were analyzed by growth on selective media and induction of β-galactosidase using filter assays. Clones were rescued by electroporation into Escherichia coli HB101 that was grown on plates with a medium containing M9 salts lacking leucine. The positive clones were subjected to DNA sequencing and transformation tests. Chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Full-length DNA for the human PP2A wild type catalytic subunit α isoform and the A subunit α isoform was amplified by PCR from HeLa cDNA generated by ThermoScript poly(dT) reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The PP2Ac insert was ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI sites in the mammalian expression vector pKH3, and the PP2A-A insert was cloned in-frame with the FLAG epitope at the BamHI/EcoRI sites of a pcDNA3-FLAG vector. Preparation of the (HA)3-PP2Ac(H118N) and FLAG-α-4 was described previously (55Chung H. Nairn A.C. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All mutants of PP2Ac were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells at 60% confluence in either 60- or 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected and incubated overnight. Single transfections used 2-5 μg of plasmid DNA, and co-transfections used 2-4 μg of the DNA of each plasmid with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as the delivery method. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Igepal CA-630), 1 mm Pefabloc-SC (Roche Applied Science), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, with and without adding 1 μm microcystin-LR (Calbiochem), as indicated. Supernatants were obtained after the scraping of cells from plates and centrifugation at 12,000 × g (4 °C) for 10 min. The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with a 1:10 mixture of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B with 1-2 μg of α-HA (12CA5), with a 1:5 mixture of α-HA beads (F7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with a 1:5 mixture of anti-FLAG beads (M2; Sigma). Blotting was done using α-HA and α-FLAG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:5,000 and 1:3,500, respectively. Antibodies against α-4 were prepared against a peptide corresponding to the 15 C-terminal residues, affinity-purified from rabbit sera, and used at a 1:3,000 dilution. Immunoblots were developed as described previously (30Eto M. Elliott E. Prickett T.D. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44013-44020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and films were analyzed by densitometry using Image-Quant software (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphatase Assay—COS7 cells were transfected with different (HA)3-PP2Ac constructs or empty vector as a control. After 24 h lysates were prepared, and 500 μg of total protein was used for immunoprecipitation with 3 μg of anti-HA antibody. The precipitates were recovered, washed by centrifugation, and suspended in phosphatase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The suspended beads were split, one portion for assay and one for immunoblotting with α-HA to show the amount of (HA)3-PP2Ac in the assay. The assay used 1 μm32P-myelin basic protein as substrate, prepared by phosphorylation with mitogen-activated protein kinase. The assay is linear when <30% of the total substrate is hydrolyzed, and all results were within this range. Parallel samples were assayed for 2 h at 30 °C with and without 50 nm okadaic acid. Samples were precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged, and the supernatants were analyzed by scintillation counting. The difference in acid-soluble 32P released ± okadaic acid was defined as the PP2A activity. Results were replicated in two or three independent experiments, and the average activities were reported. Protein Threading of PP2Ac Structure onto PP1c—The full-length PP2Ac sequence was submitted to the SWISS-MODEL data base (www.expasy.ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html). The sequence alignment of PP2A versus PP1 shows 49% overall amino acid sequence identity. The program used to view and manipulate the three-dimensional structure is called Weblab Viewerpro (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA). Location of Potential Regulatory Subunit Binding Sites in PP2Ac—Using the α-4 (mTap42) protein as bait in yeast two-hybrid screening yielded 20 clones of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) out of 65 total positives from a mouse embryo cDNA library. Both the α and β isoforms of PP2Ac were recovered, and a summary of the PP2Ac clones is depicted in Fig. 1a, showing that residues 19-165 were common to all of the PP2Ac proteins that interacted with α-4. This region of the phosphatase catalytic subunit corresponds to a compactly folded, α-helical domain seen in the structure of the closely related phosphatase PP1 (7Goldberg J. Huang H.-B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). We aligned the sequence of residues 19-165 of PP2Ac with the corresponding regions of PP4c and PP6c and compared them with phosphatases PP1c and PP2B, also known as calcineurin (Fig. 1b). The alignment exposed residues conserved among all the phosphatase catalytic subunits. These included acidic side chains known to bind active site metal ions, several glycines needed for protein folding, and His118 (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1b) in the conserved RGNHE motif that is essential for phosphatase catalytic function. The binding of α-4 and A subunits to PP2Ac is known to be mutually exclusive, suggesting that they use overlapping sites on the α-helical domain. However, only PP2Ac binds to the A subunit, not PP4c or PP6c; therefore we expected that such a binding site would involve residues that appear uniquely in PP2Ac and have different chemical properties in PP4c or PP6c. We located six such residues (Fig. 1b), and four of these had basic side chains, namely Lys41, Arg49, Lys74, and Arg108 (marked with a plus sign in Fig. 1b). The Arg108 in the PP2Ac α isoform is a Pro in the β isoform. Both isoforms bound α-4 in the two-hybrid screen, and we also mutated Arg108 to Pro in PP2Ac α, which did not influence binding to either α-4 or the A subunit using the assays described below (data not shown). The other three charged residues were individually substituted with Ala and assayed for binding to α-4 and the A regulatory subunit (see below) (Fig. 3). To find a possible α-4 binding site we located clusters of residues that are identical in PP2Ac, PP4c, and PP6c (proteins that all bind α-4) but have different charged side chains relative to PP1c (Fig. 1b). We initially focused on three sites (solid bars in Fig. 1b), YY (91-92), RIT (110-112), and SRQITQ (120-125), and substituted Ala or Ser for residues in each of these sites. With the Y91A/Y92A mutant there was no discernable effect on binding of either regulatory subunit (not shown). On the other hand, RIT/AIA and SRQ/SAS mutants produced distortion of the catalytic site, with loss of phosphatase activity and reduced binding to microcystin-LR beads (not shown). It was interesting that mutations of surface charged residues could produce such structural perturbations in the catalytic subunit; however, the loss of native conformation prevented any valid conclusions about the role of these side chains in binding to regulatory subunits. Another possible site for α-4 interaction with PP2Ac is Glu42 in the ESNVQ motif, common to PP2A, PP4, and PP6. Mutations of Glu102 in Pph21 and Glu38 in Sit4, the yeast homologue of PP2A and PP6, respectively, caused a loss of binding to Tap42, the yeast homologue of α-4 (56Wang H. Wang X. Jiang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu42 in PP2Ac altered binding to both α-4 and A subunits (see below). Co-precipitation Assays for PP2Ac Binding to Regulatory Subunits—Binding to either α-4 or the A subunit was assayed by transient expression of (HA)3-PP2Ac in COS7 cells and immunoprecipitation by the triple hemagglutinin epitope tag. We also tested an inactive version of (HA)3-PP2Ac with a H118N mutation at the active site (55Chung H. Nairn A.C. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 57Myles T. Schmidt K. Evans D.R.H. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 357: 225-232Crossref Google Scholar). Endogenous α-4 co-precipitated with both wild type and the inactive H118N (HA)3-PP2Ac (Fig. 2a, upper blot). Recovery of α-4 in the precipitates was quantitated consistently as 8-10% of the input, relative to an internal standard in the same immunoblot (2% of the cell lysate). Immunoblotting for HA (Fig. 2a, lower blot) was the loading control for recovery of the different (HA)3-PP2Ac in the immunoprecipitates. Note that the H118N mutant migrated slightly differently from wild type. Addition of microcystin-LR, an active site inhibitor of PP2Ac, did not interfere with the co-precipitation of endogenous α-4 with active or inactive (HA)3-PP2Ac (Fig. 2a, compare + and - lanes). Thus, it is unlikely that α-4 interacts with the PP2Ac active site or that binding of this inhibitor prevents binding of α-4. This observation contradicts a report that microcystin interferes with α-4 binding (58Kloeker S. Reed R. McConnell J.L. Chang D. Tran K. Westphal R.S. Law B.K. Colbran R.J. Kamoun M. Campbell K.S. Wadzinski B.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In other experiments cells were co-transfected to express both (HA)3-PP2Ac and FLAG-α-4, and the proteins were recovered together either by anti-HA precipitation or by anti-FLAG precipitation (not shown). The results showed that wild type and H118N versions of (HA)3-PP2Ac both bound to endogenous or epitope-tagged α-4. In contrast, low yields of co-precipitation made it appear as if the endogenous A subunit did not associate with (HA)3-PP2Ac (Fig. 2b, upper blot). The A subunit was intensely stained as an internal standard by immunoblotting 2% of the cell lysates, showing the low yields recovered with (HA)3-PP2Ac wild type or H118N. The apparent difference in recovery of the A subunit ± MCLR seen in Fig. 2b was not taken as significant, considering the low yield in both samples. We reasoned that in these co-precipitations the A subunit was probably displaced by the anti-HA antibody because previously we showed by column chromatography that ectopically expressed (HA)3-PP2Ac did associate with the endogenous A subunit and eluted as PP2A-AC heterodimer and ABC heterotrimer (55Chung H. Nairn A.C. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach to examining PP2A subunit association we co-expressed FLAG-PP2A-A with either wild type or H118N versions of (HA)3-PP2Ac, and under these circumstances we recovered the A and C subunits togeth"

Whereas its N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) binds independently to DNA, the affinity of DBD protein for forked structures is relatively weak. Although the PriA helicase domain (HD) is required for high affinity fork binding, HD protein had very low affinity for DNA. It had only low levels of ATPase activity, and it hydrolyzed ATP when DNA was absent whereas PriA did not. HD catalyzed unwinding of a minimal substrate composed of a duplex with a 3′ single-stranded tail. Single-strand binding protein (SSB) bound to the tail of this substrate inhibited this reaction by full-length PriA but enhanced the reaction by HD. SSB stabilized binding of PriA but not of DBD or HD to duplexes with a 5′ or 3′ single-stranded tail. On forked substrates SSB enhanced helicase action on the lagging-strand arm by PriA but not by HD. The results indicate that synergy of the DBD and HD allows stable binding at the interface between duplex and single-stranded DNA bound by SSB. This mode of binding may be analogous to fork binding, which orients the helicase to act on the lagging-strand side of the fork.

Escherichia coli PriA protein is one of seven proteins (including PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG) that make up the restart primosome, an apparatus that promotes assembly of replisomes at recombination intermediates and stalled replication forks (for reviews, see Refs. 1Jones J.M.

PriA plays a critical function in restarting DNA replication after fork arrest by binding to forked DNA structures to promote the assembly of the primosome and consequently the replisome (5McGlynn P.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), including the loading of the major replicative helicase DnaB at the fork. PriA protein possesses 3′ to 5′ helicase activity (10Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee M.S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8345-8349Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which can serve to unwind any duplex on the lagging-strand arm of the fork and load DnaB onto the lagging-strand template. Once bound, DnaB translocates 5′ to 3′ (12LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) along the template to unwind the parental duplex, anchors the dimeric DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to the fork for catalysis of concurrent leading- and lagging-strand synthesis (13Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and attracts primase (DnaG) needed to initiate multiple cycles of lagging-strand synthesis (14Tougo K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PriA belongs to the Superfamily 2 of helicases (15Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), based on homology of several conserved amino acid motifs (I–VI; Fig. 1A). Proteolysis analysis with trypsin has indicated hypersensitive cleavage sites at Arg-198 and Lys-518 that separate PriA into three domains. 1Timothy C. Mueser, personal communication. The N-terminal 181 residues have been found to bind to D-loop structures although with 20-fold reduced affinity than the binding of full-length PriA (16Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This indicates that the Met-1–Arg-198 domain functions in DNA binding (Fig. 1A) and that the remaining portion (Leu-199–Gly-732) of PriA may function to increase DNA binding affinity and specificity. The Leu-199–Gly-732 segment may be considered the helicase domain (HD) 2The abbreviations used are: HD, PriA helicase domain; DBD, PriA DNA binding domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; nt, nucleotides; PAS, primosome assembly site; SSB, single-strand binding protein. since it includes all of the helicase motifs as well as a zinc finger motif implicated in helicase action; the latter motif most likely functions in interactions PriA establishes with DNA to translocate 3′ to 5′ along the template (17Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4337-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although certain inactivating mutations in motif I (Walker A box) (18Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4255) Google Scholar), which most likely functions in ATP binding and/or hydrolysis, and the zinc finger motif do not significantly reduce DNA binding (19Masai H. Deneke J. Furui Y. Tanaka T. Arai K.I. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), replacement of the conserved residues Arg-512, Arg-517, Glu-527, and His-529 with alanines resulted in a mutant protein unable to bind D-loop DNA (16Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), further confirming the important role of the HD of PriA in allowing stable binding to D-loop DNA. The contribution of the HD domain to DNA binding raises questions as to its helicase activity and DNA binding property when it is separated from the DBD. Full-length PriA has been characterized to have two modes of DNA binding (20Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In one mode PriA binds D-loop, and it has been hypothesized that PriA recognizes bent DNA at three strand junctions. In the second mode PriA binds to duplex DNA with a protruding 3′ single strand; this mode has been hypothesized to reflect the intrinsic ability of a 3′ to 5′ helicase to recognize such a DNA substrate (20Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Both the D-loop and the duplex with the single-stranded 3′ tail have been found to be substrates of PriA helicase action (5McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Helicase action on the lagging-strand side of forked substrates and the basal mode of helicase action on the minimal substrate (duplex with the 3′ single-stranded tail) do have distinct properties (22Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unwinding of the minimal substrate by PriA is inhibited by the presence of single-strand binding protein (SSB). In contrast, binding of SSB to the single-stranded leading-strand template of the fork greatly stimulates unwinding of duplex DNA on the lagging-strand arm by PriA. Moreover, the bound SSB on the fork inhibits unwinding of the parental duplex, helicase action that would result from translocation of PriA along the leading-strand template. Thus, bound SSB generally inhibits basal mode of helicase on duplexes with the 3′ single-stranded extension; however, it cannot inhibit helicase action on the lagging-strand arm even when it is directly bound to this arm (22Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results have suggested that fork binding orients the HD to act on the lagging-strand arm, SSB bound to the fork enhancing this mode of PriA binding. In this paper we purified HD protein to determine its characteristics when severed from the DBD. We report that the HD has ATPase activity and can carry out the basal mode of helicase action. However, it has very low DNA binding affinity and, thus, has very low activity. Nevertheless, in full-length PriA, the HD plays an important role together with the DBD in recognizing the transition from duplex to single-stranded DNA, most likely the bend between the parental duplex and the leading- and lagging-strand arms of the fork. Plasmids and Proteins—The coding sequences for the PriA DBD (Met-1–Leu-199), the HD (Gly-194–Gly-732), and HD with a mutant motif I (HD-K230R) were introduced into plasmid vectors that are part of the IMPACT-CN system (New England Biolabs). By this system the protein domains are fused at the N or C terminus to a self-cleaving intein tag that contains a chitin binding domain for affinity purification. The intein tag is removed during purification. The DBD-coding sequence was amplified with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase using plasmid pND706-PriA as template (6Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and primers GGTGGTCATATGCCCGTTGCCCACGTTG and GGTGGTTGCTCTTCCGCACAATCGCAACCGCTCACCAG. The resulting PCR product was inserted between the NdeI and SapI sites of pTYB1. The resulting plasmid (pTYB1-PriA-DBD) encodes a protein that has a cleavable intein tag attached at Leu-199 at the C terminus of the DBD. The coding sequence for HD and HD-K230R was prepared by amplification of templates pND706-PriA and pND706-PriA-K230R, respectively, using primers GGTGGTCATATGGGTGAGCGGTTGCGATTGAAT and CGGAATTCTTAACCCTCAATCGGATCAACA. The PCR products were ligated between the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pTYB12. The resulting plasmids (pTYB12-PriA-HD and pTYB12-PriA-HD-K230R) encode HD proteins with a cleavable intein tag attached at Gly-194 (numbering of residues for both HD and DBD proteins as in the full-length protein), the residue at the N terminus of the HD proteins. The sequence of all constructed plasmids was verified by sequencing. For purification, intein-tagged DBD and HD proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) transformed with the overproducing plasmid vectors. Cells were grown in 500 ml of L broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °Ctoan A600 of 0.5. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mm) was added, and the culture was incubated with shaking overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) with 0.1% Tween 20, and they were lysed with sonication and cleared by centrifugation for 1 h at 13,000 × g. Purification of the proteins was based on the protocol suggested by the IMPACT system manufacturer and was carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. The lysate was applied to a chitin column (2-ml bed volume; New England Biolabs) in column buffer. The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer A containing 1 m NaCl. The column was quickly flushed with 6 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and then left at room temperature for 40 h to allow intein cleavage. DBD or HD protein was eluted with buffer A, and the eluted fraction was dialyzed overnight against buffer B (50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.7, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% w/v sucrose). Further purification was based on a previously described PriA purification procedure (23Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The dialyzed protein fraction was applied to a Bio-Rex 70 column (1-ml bed volume) equilibrated in buffer B, and the column was washed with 5 ml of buffer C (buffer B containing 40 mm ammonium sulfate). Protein was eluted by an 8-ml linear gradient from 100 to 800 mm NaCl in buffer C. DBD protein was eluted at 0.25 m NaCl whereas HD and HD-K230R were found in the flow-through fractions. Proteins (Fig. 1B) were dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.7, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 mm ammonium sulfate, 40% glycerol) overnight, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. The typical yield was about 1 mg for the DBD and 0.2 mg for HD (or HD-K230R) from 500 ml of culture. Protein of comparable specific activity was obtained whether intein cleavage was carried out at 4 °C or room temperature, but the highest yield was obtained at room temperature. DBD proteins cleaved at the two temperatures, for example, bound to forked DNA substrates with comparable dissociation constants, measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays described below. Moreover, the binding affinity of DBD for forked substrates presented in this work is comparable with the affinity of PriA N-terminal segments (residues 1–181 and 1–193) for D-loops previously described (16Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The activity of the HD protein was further evaluated by comparing its ATPase, helicase, and ATP binding activities with that of PriA as described under “Results.” Purified PriA, PriA-K230R, and SSB used in this work have been previously described (6Jones J.M.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of PriA, DBD, and HD are indicated in equivalents of protein monomers. SSB concentrations are expressed in equivalents of tetramers. ATPase and Helicase Assays—ATP hydrolysis was measured as previously described (6Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in reaction mixtures containing SSB and denatured pGG215 DNA. The plasmid pGG215 includes the two-primosome assembly site (PAS) sequences of plasmid pBR322 (25Zipursky S.L. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (15 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES-K+, pH 8.0, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml rifampicin, 700 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 0.13 nm linearized and denatured pGG215 DNA (in equivalents of plasmid molecules), 1 μm SSB, and the indicated concentrations of PriA, HD, or DBD. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 °C and stopped at the indicated times by the addition of 200 mm EDTA to 40 mm final concentration. A 3-μl portion of each reaction mixture was spotted on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (J. T. Baker Inc.), which was developed in 0.5 m LiCl, 4.6% v/v formic acid. The plate was dried and subjected to phosphorimaging. Substrates for PriA helicase and DNA binding were constructed and purified as previously described (6Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides S1, S2, S3–5, S4, M1, M2, M3, and M4 (6Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were used to construct the various helicase substrates (Fig. 2). In each substrate one oligonucleotide was radiolabeled with 32P to a specific activity of 2–5 × 106 cpm/pmol using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Substrates were assembled by annealing the respective oligonucleotides and were then purified by resolution on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Any partially annealed products were distinguished by mobility on the polyacrylamide gel. The mobility of the desired substrates and partially annealed products was established in reconstruction experiments, in which various combinations of the oligonucleotides were annealed to the radiolabeled oligonucleotide and resolved by electrophoresis. The oligonucleotide composition of DNA substrates was also confirmed by radiolabeling all oligonucleotides in the purified substrate and then separating them on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Helicase reactions were carried out as previously described (6Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 0.8 nm DNA substrates, 12 nm SSB when present and the indicated concentrations of PriA, HD, or DBD. Products were treated with SDS and proteinase K and resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels (30:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3; 10 V/cm for 2 h). The extent of unwinding was quantified using a PhosphorImager. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Mobility shift analyses were conducted as described (22Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 6% v/v glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8 nm DNA substrates, 12 nm SSB where indicated, and PriA, DBD, or HD proteins as indicated. When reaction mixtures included SSB, it was incubated with substrates for 5 min on ice before the addition of PriA, DBD, or HD, and then incubation was continued for 15 min on ice. The reaction mixtures were then directly loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel (80:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.5× TBE and 2.4% glycerol. Electrophoresis was conducted at room temperature at 5 V/cm for 2 h. To quantify the level of DNA binding using phosphorimaging, the radioactivity in the free, unbound substrate and the total activity in the shifted forms were quantified for each lane. The ratio of bound DNA substrate to total substrate was calculated. ATP Binding Assay—Binding of [α-32P]ATP to HD or PriA protein was measured by retention on nitrocellulose filters. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), 100 μm [α-32P]ATP (1.1 Ci/mmol), and 250–600 nm HD or PriA. 100 μm ATP was found to be saturating for binding by HD. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 0 °C for 10 min and passed through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, white HAWP, 0.45-μm pore size, and 25-mm diameter) presoaked in reaction buffer. Filters were then washed with 10 ml of reaction buffer (prechilled to 0 °C) at a flow rate of 10 ml/min, dried, and counted in liquid scintillation fluid. The background from the reaction mixture containing no HD or PriA protein was subtracted from all measurements. Protein concentrations for this analysis were determined from the calculated molar extinction coefficient for HD and PriA as previously described (26Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3450) Google Scholar). Purification of DBD and HD of PriA—The hypersensitive trypsin cleavage site at Arg-198 divides PriA protein into two domains (Fig. 1A), the DBD and HD. To purify these parts of the PriA protein, DBD protein was expressed with an intein tag attached at the C terminus, and HD was expressed with the intein tag at the N terminus. These self-cleaving tags contain a chitin binding domain, and they are cleaved off and removed during affinity purification. Any minor contaminating bands were further removed by chromatography on a Bio-Rex 70 column. HD protein with a mutation in the Walker A box (HD-K230R) was purified in an analogous fashion. The final preparations of DBD, HD, and HD-K230R (Fig. 1B) were greater than 95% pure. HD Has Low Levels of DNA-independent ATPase Activity— PriA protein has ATPase activity that can be activated by the presence of single-stranded DNA that contains a PAS site, a sequence to which PriA binds even in the presence of SSB (27Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Shlomai J. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In reactions mixtures containing 5 nm PriA protein, ATPase activity could be readily activated by denatured DNA that contains the two PAS sites of pBR322 (25Zipursky S.L. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in the presence of SSB. However, ATPase activity of HD present at 5 nm could not be detected even in the presence of DNA, indistinguishable from the reaction with PriA and no DNA (Fig. 3A). When present at 10-fold higher levels (50 nm), HD exhibited ATPase activity that was significantly higher than the same concentration of PriA without DNA (Fig. 3B). Notably, this ATPase activity of HD can be elicited in the absence of DNA, and the presence of DNA did not increase the level ATPase activity (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, HD-K230R, which bears a mutation in motif I rendering PriA deficient in ATPase and helicase activity (29Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6933-6940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no detectable ATPase activity when present at the high concentration (Fig. 3B). In our standard assay SSB together with denatured DNA was added to reaction mixtures to activate the ATPase; SSB could conceivably inhibit interactions of HD with DNA. However, the addition of denatured DNA without SSB also did not promote an increase in ATPase activity (data not shown). The DBD protein, even when it was added in excess over HD, could not further activate the ATPase activity of HD in the presence of DNA (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that HD severed from the DBD retains intrinsic ATPase activity; however, its ATPase function has lost the capacity to be activated in the presence of PAS-containing DNA. The significantly higher ATPase activity of HD over PriA in the absence of DNA indicates that the DBD may also function to negatively modulate the HD ATPase function. To further examine the DBD's effect on PriA ATPase function, ATP binding in the absence of DNA was measured by a nitrocellulose filter retention assay. HD protein stably bound ATP, whereas PriA did not (Fig. 1C). At least 1 molecule of ATP was still bound per 10 molecules of HD even after washing the filter with an excess of reaction buffer (500 times the volume of the binding reaction mixture over the course of 1 min). In contrast, very little ATP was bound to HD-K230R, which would be expected to be defective in ATP binding. PriA bound ATP almost as inefficiently as HD-K230R. This indicates that either ATP is not bound to PriA in the absence of DNA or the bound ATP dissociates during the wash. The very stable binding of ATP to HD indicates that HD is indeed proficient in ATP binding and also raises the possibility that the bound ATP turns over relatively slowly. These results clearly indicate that the lack of the DBD segment allows HD ATPase function to be active without DNA, allowing ATP hydrolysis at a low basal rate. Because HD ATPase function cannot be further increased by DNA, its relatively low ATPase activity may reflect an inability to translocate processively along single-stranded DNA, a process that would be fueled by extensive ATP hydrolysis. Because the lack of the DBD in HD protein results in a gain of function (i.e. DNA-independent ATP binding and hydrolysis), low ATPase activity attributed to misfolding or denaturation of HD due to the lack of the DBD segment is a less likely possibility even though some inactivation of HD molecules by this mechanism cannot be ruled out. HD Can Catalyze the Basal Mode of PriA Helicase—We previously determined that there are two modes of PriA helicase action on the model fork Substrate C[-5] (22Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This substrate (Table I; 3′-OH ends are indicated by half-arrows) has a single-stranded leading-strand arm and a duplex lagging-strand arm. PriA unwinds both duplexes of this fork. The [-5] designation for the substrate indicates a 5-base gap between the lagging strand and the fork (see Fig. 2); a gap of at least two nucleotides is required to unwind the lagging-strand arm of this fork (22Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We had hypothesized that unwinding of the parental duplex of the fork, where PriA would translocate 3′ to 5′ on the leading-strand template, represents a basal mode of helicase action; in this mode the basic features of a minimal substrate, a duplex with a 3′ single-stranded tail, are recognized (22Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Like the unwinding of the minimal substrate W, this mode of unwinding Substrate C[-5] is diminished by the presence of SSB (Table I). Unwinding of the lagging-strand arm of the fork is hypothesized to be the result of fork-specific binding, which orients the helicase to translocate along the lagging-strand template. In contrast to its effect on unwinding the parental duplex, SSB increases unwinding of the lagging-strand arm of Substrate C[-5] (Table I).Table IComparison of the helicase activity of PriA and HD Open table in a new tab In the absence of SSB, HD had basal helicase activity, but very high levels of the protein were required for activity comparable with PriA (HD was present at 26 times the concentration of PriA for the experiments shown in Table I). HD was able to promote unwinding of the parental duplex of Substrate C[-5] but was unable to unwind the lagging-strand arm of the fork. No products corresponding to a fork with two single-stranded arms were formed (Table I). A small amount of single-stranded S2 DNA was formed as product. However, this most likely corresponds to two reactions, which are unwinding of the parental duplex of Substrate C[-5] to first form the minimal substrate W and then the unwinding of substrate W to yield single-stranded S2. HD was very inefficient in unwinding the parental duplex of substrate F[-5] (Table I), a forked substrate with duplex DNA on the leading-strand arm and a 5-base gap adjacent to the fork. In contrast, PriA was able to unwind the parental duplex of substrates F[-5] at a significant level although not as efficiently as it unwound the parental duplex of Substrate C[-5]. These results indicate that HD can catalyze the basal mode of helicase but is unable to catalyze the hypothesized fork-specific mode. The lack of the DBD reduces its basal helicase activity, most likely by reducing its affinity for DNA. The larger segment of 3′ single-stranded DNA present on Substrates C[-5] and W but not on F[-5] may be necessary for HD to bind to and translocate along the leading-strand template. SSB Stimulates the Basal Helicase Mode of HD but Inhibits That of PriA—One way that SSB could inhibit the basal mode of PriA helicase would be to prevent the binding of its HD moiety to duplexes with a 3′ single-stranded extension. However, SSB increases the HD basal mode of helicase action on Substrates C[-5] and W while inhibiting this mode of helicase action by PriA (Table I). On substrate W, the level of unwinding increases linearly with HD concentration in the presence or absence of SSB, the activity being about 2-fold higher in its presence (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, at high concentrations of HD required to elicit helicase action (50 nm and higher), PriA is essentially inactive on substrate W in the presence of SSB (Fig. 4B). At low concentrations (e.g. 10–50 nm) PriA is more active than HD when SSB is absent (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that SSB can facilitate the basal mode of helicase by HD. They suggest that SSB may not inhibit the PriA basal mode of helicase simply by preventing binding of the minimal substrate by the"

We have examined the contribution of the caspase cascade to NF-κB activation via TRAIL, a mammalian tumor necrosis factor family ligand that is a potent activator of caspases. Our results demonstrate that TRAIL activates NF-κB in two phases as follows: an early caspase independent phase and a late caspase dependent phase. The late phase of the TRAIL-induced NF-κB is critically dependent on caspase 8 and can be blocked by pharmacological and genetic inhibitors of caspase 8 activation, such as benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, benzyloxycarbonyl-IETD-fluoromethyl ketone, and small interfering RNA targeting caspase 8 and FADD. Whereas caspase 3 is required for TRAIL-induced apoptosis, it is not involved in TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation. The late phase of TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation involves caspase mediated cleavage of IκBα between Asp31 and Ser32 residues to generate an N-terminal truncated fragment that is degraded by the proteasome via the N-end rule pathway.

Five known members of this family have been characterized to date and include c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor p105), p65 (RelA), and RelB (4Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4610) Google Scholar, 5Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). Although many dimeric forms of NF-κB have been described, the classical NF-κB complex is a heterodimer of the p65/RelA and p50 subunits and is found in most cells in association with a family of inhibitory proteins, called IκBs, of which the most common is IκBα (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar, 4Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4610) Google Scholar). The IκB proteins retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm by masking its nuclear localization signal. Stimulation by a number of cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-1, results in the activation of a multisubunit IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which leads to the inducible phosphorylation of IκB proteins at two conserved serine residues located within their N-terminal region (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar, 4Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4610) Google Scholar). Phospho-IκB proteins are ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome, thereby releasing NF-κB from their inhibitory influence (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). Once released, NF-κB is free to migrate to the nucleus and bind to the promoter of specific genes possessing its cognate binding site. The members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily and their ligands have been recognized to play a crucial role in normal development and in the regulation of immune and inflammatory response (6Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar, 7Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). In addition, a subgroup of these receptors, such as TNFR1, Fas/CD95, death receptor 3 (DR3/TRAMP), death receptor 4 (DR4/TRAIL-R1), death receptor 5 (DR5/TRAIL-R2), and death receptor 6 (DR6) are capable of inducing programmed cell death or apoptosis and are collectively referred to as death receptors (6Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar, 8Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). The apoptosis inducing ability of these receptors has been mapped to a conserved cytoplasmic domain of 60–80 amino acids, called the death domain (DD) (6Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). TNFR1 is the prototypical and perhaps the best characterized death receptor (9Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced trimerization of TNFR1 leads to the recruitment of the DD-containing adaptor protein TRADD, which helps in the formation of a plasma membrane-bound complex (complex I) via the recruitment of RIP1 and TRAF2 (10Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar, 11Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25534-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Assembly of complex I occurs in lipid rafts and leads to NF-κB activation via RIP1-mediated recruitment of the IKK complex, whereas the c-Jun N-terminal kinase is activated via TRAF2-mediated activation of the mitogen-activated protein 3-kinase (10Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar, 11Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Subsequently, TRADD and RIP1 dissociate from complex I and associate with a cytoplasmic complex (complex II) consisting of DD-containing protein FADD and procaspase 8, the apical caspase of the caspase cascade (10Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Under the conditions favoring TNFR1-induced apoptosis, procaspase 8 is activated upon recruitment to complex II and subsequently results in the activation of downstream caspases, such as caspase 3, 6, and 7, and eventual cell death (10Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). However, in most cell types, activation of the caspase cascade by TNFR1 is blocked by the concurrent activation of the NF-κB pathway, which is believed to protect cells against apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules, such as cFLIPL and c-IAP1 (10Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Unlike TNFR1, signaling via Fas, DR4/TRAIL-R1, and DR5/TRAIL-R2 delivers a strong and rapid pro-apoptotic signal (8Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar, 13Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to these receptors leads to DD-mediated recruitment of FADD directly without the involvement of TRADD (13Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 14Peter M.E. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). FADD subsequently leads to the recruitment and activation of procaspase 8 (8Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar, 13Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). DR4/TRAIL-R1 and DR5/TRAIL-R2 are also known to activate the NF-κB pathway, although activation of this pathway via these receptors is of lower magnitude and slower kinetics as compared with TNFR1 (15Chaudhary P.M.

Keane M.M. Kelliher M. Lipkowitz S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6638-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, RIP1 and IKK complex-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα has been implicated in NF-κB activation via the TRAIL receptors as well (18Lin Y. Devin A. Cook A. Keane M.M. Kelliher M. Lipkowitz S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6638-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), suggesting that they share at least some components of NF-κB signaling with TNFR1. The mammalian tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway shares several similarities with the Drosophila immune deficiency (imd) pathway, which controls the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes after Gram-negative bacterial infection (see Fig. 7) (1Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The central transcription factor in the imd signaling pathway is Relish, a Drosophila NF-κB homolog. Relish resembles the mammalian p100 and p105 proteins in overall structure and is composed of a DNA-binding Rel homology domain and an inhibitory IκB-like ankyrin-repeat domain (1Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to its mammalian counterparts, activation of Relish does not require proteasome-mediated degradation of its IκB-like region. Instead, Relish is activated by endoproteolytic cleavage in the linker region between the Rel and IκB-like domains (1Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The cleavage of Relish requires the activities of two arms of the imd pathway (Fig. 7). The first arm includes IMD-(Drosophila RIP1 homolog) and dTAK1 (Drosophila transforming growth factor-β activating kinase)-mediated activation of Drosophila IκB kinase (DmIKK) complex (19Georgel P.

The DmIKK complex consists of Drosophila IKKβ/immune response-deficient 5 (Ird5) and Drosophila IKKγ/Kenny and phosphorylates Relish, triggering its cleavage (21Silverman N. Zhou R. Stoven S.

Actual cleavage of Relish is believed to be mediated by the second arm of the imd pathway that involves Drosophila FADD (dFADD)-mediated activation of Dredd, a Drosophila caspase (Fig. 7) (24Stoven S.

Dredd resembles caspase 8 in structure and is believed to participate in Relish activation by inducing its cleavage between the Rel and IκB homology domains (25Stoven S. Silverman N. Junell A.

As discussed above, the first arm of imd pathway is conserved in mammalian cells and has been shown to play a critical role in NF-κB activation via the TNFR family members. However, a role for caspase activation in NF-κB activation in mammalian cells has been lacking so far (1Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In this report we have analyzed NF-κB activation via TRAIL, a TNF family ligand that is a powerful activator of the caspase cascade and is also known to induce NF-κB activation. We present evidence demonstrating a conserved role for the second, caspase-dependent, arm of the imd pathway in NF-κB activation via the TRAIL receptors. Cell Lines and Reagents—293, 293T, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IκBα and NEMO were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against caspase 8 and cleaved PARP were from Cell Signaling, and those against FADD and RIP were from Transduction Laboratories. Human recombinant TRAIL, TNF-α, and IL-1β were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and were used at concentrations of 100, 10, and 10 ng/ml, respectively. Caspase inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO. Expression Constructs—A retroviral construct encoding FLAG-DR4 was made by amplifying a DNA fragment encoding FLAG-DR4 by using Pfu polymerase and subsequently subcloning into the MSCV-neo vector (Clontech). Constructs encoding IκBα and an NF-κB/luciferase reporter have been described previously (30Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Berberich I. Shu G.L. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4357-4366PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding IκBα was subcloned into the pCMVTag-1 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to make the construct FLAG-IκBα-Myc that carries an N-terminal FLAG tag and a C-terminal Myc tag. The D31A mutant of IκBα was made by using site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Adeno-associated viral vectors encoding C-terminal HA-tagged IκBα and its mutants were made by using a commercially available kit (Stratagene). siRNA Oligonucleotides—siRNA oligonucleotides with two thymidine residues (dTdT) at the 3′-end of the sequence were designed to caspase 8 (sense, 5′-GCAAGAACCCAUCAAGGAUdTdT-3′), caspase 3 (sense, 5′-GCGAAUCAAUGGACUCUGGdTdT-3′), caspase 6 (sense, 5′-CAUGACAGAAACAGAUGCCdTdT-3′), caspase 7 (sense, 5′-GAUUCAGUGGAUGCUAAGCdTdT-3′), FADD (sense, 5′-CGUCAUAUGUGAUAAUGUGdTdT-3′), and Lamin A/C (sense, 5′-CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACAdTdT-3′), along with their corresponding antisense oligonucleotides. The RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO) or RNA Oligonucleotide Synthesis Core facility, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Transfection of siRNA Oligonucleotides—293NF-κB FLAG-DR4 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and transfected with various siRNA oligonucleotides (40 nm) using calcium phosphate or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with PBS, TRAIL (100 ng/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), and IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 10 h and subsequently lysed for reporter assay and Western blotting. Generation of 293NF-κB-DR4 Cells—Generation of 293NF-κB-Luc cells has been described previously (32Matta H. Sun Q. Moses G. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52406-52411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 293NF-κB-Luc cells were infected with an empty retrovirus vector or one encoding FLAG-tagged DR4 and selected with G418. One of the clones that responded to TRAIL-signaling was chosen for further studies. Luciferase Reporter Assays—The NF-κB reporter assay was performed essentially as described previously (33Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2668-2677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 293NF-κB vector cells and 293NF-κB-DR4 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Thirty-six hours later cells were treated in duplicates with Me2SO or Z-VAD-fmk for 30 min prior to treatment with the ligands. The cells were lysed 10 h following treatment, and lysates were used for determining the luciferase activity and protein concentration (Bradford-assay; Bio-Rad). Luciferase activity was normalized relative to protein concentration. All experiments were in duplicate and repeated at least two times. The values shown are average (mean ± S.E.) of a representative of at least two independent experiments. Generation and Characterization of 293NF-κB-DR4 Cell Line—In order to facilitate a comparative analysis of NF-κB activation by ligands of the TNF family, we generated subclones of 293 (human embryonic kidney) cell line with stable expression of an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter construct. One of the subclones, designated 293NFκB-Luc, demonstrated low level basal luciferase activity but a robust increase (∼100-fold) upon stimulation with TNFα, a known activator of the NF-κB pathway. However, unlike TNFα, treatment with TRAIL led to only a minimal increase in luciferase activity in 293NF-κB-Luc cells, which was probably reflective of the weak expression of TRAIL receptors in these cells. In order to make 293NF-κB-Luc cells responsive to TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation, we used retrovirally mediated gene transfer to generate 293NF-κB-luc cells stably expressing an empty vector or an N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged DR4 (also called TRAIL-R1), one of the TRAIL receptors capable of activating the NF-κB pathway. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, 293NF-κB-DR4 cells demonstrated modest expression of DR4 as measured by cell surface staining with a FLAG antibody. Consistent with the expression of DR4, 293NF-κB-DR4 cells demonstrated an increase in the NF-κB reporter activity upon stimulation with TRAIL as compared with the empty vector-expressing cells (Fig. 1, C and D). However, despite the presence of the exogenously expressed DR4, NF-κB activation by TRAIL was relatively modest (∼25-fold increase) as compared with that induced by treatment with TNFα (∼120-fold increase) (Fig. 1, C and D). Treatment of 293NF-κB-DR4 cells with TRAIL also led to apoptosis in ∼15–25% of cells, whereas treatment with TNFα failed to do so (not shown). TRAIL-induced apoptosis in 293NF-κB-DR4 cells could be completely blocked by a broad range caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, thereby indicating the involvement of caspases in this process (data not shown). TRAIL-induced NF-κB Activation Is Inhibited by Broad Range Caspase Inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk—As the 293NF-κB-DR4 cells activated NF-κB in response to both TNF and TRAIL but induced caspase-dependent apoptosis only in response to TRAIL, they provided a convenient system to investigate the contribution of caspases to NF-κB activation. We began by studying the effect of the broad range caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk on TNFα- and TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation in these cells. For this purpose, cells were treated with 20 μm Z-VAD-fmk for 30 min before and during the treatment with the ligands, and luciferase activity was measured on cellular extracts obtained after 10 h of treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with TNFα led to strong activation of NF-κB luciferase activity which was only minimally influenced by Z-VAD-fmk. In contrast, treatment with Z-VAD-fmk led to an almost 5-fold reduction in TRAIL-induced NF-κB luciferase activity as compared with Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 2B). To confirm that the observed effect is specific to the inhibition of caspases and not cathepsin B, which is also inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk (34Schotte P. Declercq W. Van Huffel S. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we used the cathepsin B inhibitor E64. Treatment with 20 μm E64 failed to block either TNFα- or TRAIL-induced NF-κB (Fig. 2, A and B). We also ruled out the possibility that NF-κB activation observed in 293NF-κB-DR4 cells is a nonspecific effect of caspase activation and resultant cell death by using several agents known to induce caspase activation via receptor-independent mechanisms. Consistent with our results published previously (35Chaudhary P.M. Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Kumar A. Liu L. Hood L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4451-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), transient transfection of plasmids encoding several pro-apoptotic molecules, such as Bax, Bid, human caspase 6, 9, and 10, led to varying levels of cell death but failed to stimulate NF-κB luciferase activity (Fig. 2C). Collectively, the above results indicate that NF-κB activation observed following treatment with TRAIL is not a nonspecific consequence of caspase activation or cell death. TRAIL-induced NF-κB Activation Is Inhibited by Preferential Inhibitors of Caspase 8 —Caspase 8 plays a critical role in the activation of the caspase cascade via the TRAIL receptors (14Peter M.E. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Z-IETD-fmk, a cell-permeable caspase inhibitor that preferentially blocks caspase 8, had no significant effect on TNFα-induced NF-κB activation but was as effective as Z-VAD-fmk in blocking NF-κB activation by TRAIL (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, Z-YDVAD-fmk, a preferential inhibitor of caspase 2, was only partially effective in blocking TRAIL-induced NF-κB (Fig. 3, C and D). The data using peptidyl-based caspase inhibitors, such as Z-IETD-fmk and Z-YDVAD-fmk, should be interpreted with caution as they lack absolute specificity. Therefore, in order to provide genetic proof of the involvement of caspase 8 in TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation, we used the RNA interference approach to down-regulate its expression. As shown in Fig. 3E, effective suppression of caspase 8 protein in 293NF-κB-DR4 cells was achieved following a single round of transfection with a caspase 8-specific siRNA duplex. Similarly, an siRNA duplex targeted against FADD, the adaptor that recruits caspase 8 to the TRAIL DISC, led to near complete loss of its expression (Fig. 3F). The caspase 8 and FADD siRNAs also completely blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis (not shown). We next tested the ability of caspase 8 and FADD siRNAs to block NF-κB activation via TNFα, IL-1β, and TRAIL. We used siRNAs directed against lamin A/C as a control for these experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, G and H, siRNAs against caspase 8 and FADD had no significant effect on TNFα- and IL-1β-induced NF-κB but effectively blocked TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation. Taken together with the results using Z-IETD-fmk, the above studies confirm the involvement of caspase 8 in TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation. Caspase 3 Is Required for TRAIL-induced Apoptosis but Not TRAIL-induced NF-κB—Caspase 3 is an executioner caspase that is known to play a key role in death receptor-induced apoptosis. We used the siRNA approach to specifically down-regulate expression of caspase 3 and to test its involvement in TRAIL-induced NF-κB and apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, caspase 3 siRNA effectively silenced its expression and blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis in 293NF-κB DR4 cells. Most interestingly, unlike the case with caspase 8, silencing of caspase 3 had no significant effect on either TNFα- or TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 4, C and D). Furthermore, Z-VAD-fmk could effectively block TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation even in cells in which TRAIL-induced apoptosis was blocked due to silencing of caspase 3 expression (Fig. 4, E and F). In addition to caspase 3, caspases 6 and 7 are also known to act as executioner caspases. However, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of caspases 6 and 7 failed to block TRAIL-induced NF-κB (Fig. 4, G and H). Taken together, the inhibitory effect of Z-VAD-fmk on TRAIL-induced NF-κB is independent of its effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis and activation of caspases 3, 6, or 7. Caspase Activity Is Required for the Late Phase of NF-κB Activation by TRAIL—To understand the mechanism by which caspases promote TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation, we carried out an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 5A, Z-VAD-fmk had no effect on the early phase (up to 6 h) of TRAIL-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity. However, while TRAIL-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity increased at the 8- and 10-h time points in Me2SO-treated cells, co-treatment with Z-VAD-fmk led to a gradual decline beginning at 8 h (Fig. 5A). We obtained essentially similar results in HeLa cells, in which TRAIL signaling was initiated via its endogenously expressed receptors (Fig. 5B). Collectively, the above results suggest that caspase activity is required for the late phase of NF-κB activation by TRAIL but is dispensable for the early phase. Caspase Inhibitors Block the Late Phase of TRAIL-induced IκBα Degradation—We next sought to determine whether Z-VAD-fmk blocks TRAIL-induced NF-κB by influencing the level of the IκBα protein. In the absence of Z-VAD-fmk, IκBα almost completely disappeared following 2 h of TRAIL treatment (Fig. 5C, lane 4). The expression of IκBα reappeared at the 4- and 8-h time points (Fig. 5C, lanes 5 and 6), which probably reflected newly synthesized protein, and disappeared again at the 10- and 12-h time points (Fig. 5C, lanes 7 and 8). The decrease in expression of IκBα observed at the latter time points was not a nonspecific consequence of caspase activation as we observed no significant change in the expression of several control proteins, such as actin, NEMO, and RIP1 (Fig. 5C). Most importantly, consistent with the gel-shift assay, cotreatment with Z-VAD-fmk had no effect on the early phase (2-h time point) of IκBα decline (Fig. 5C, lane 12) but effectively blocked the delayed (10- and 12-h time points) decrease in its expression (Fig. 5C, lanes 15 and 16). We next studied the effect of siRNA-mediated caspase 8 silencing on the late phase down-regulation of IκBα expression following treatment with TRAIL and TNFα. For this purpose, cells were transfected with siRNAs against caspase 8 or Lamin A/C (negative control),and at 48 h post-transfection cells were treated with TNFα or TRAIL for 10 h. As expected, both TRAIL and TNFα treatments led to a significant decline in IκBα expression (Fig. 5D). However, while silencing of caspase 8 expression led to significant inhibition of IκBα down-regulation following treatment with TRAIL, it had only a marginal effect on TNFα-induced IκB"

Like V(D)J recombination, SHM and CSR are critically dependent on transcription, as driven by three main cis-regulatory regions: the promoter upstream of each V gene (V), the IgH evolutionarily conserved sequence (ECS)-intervening (I) region promoter, which is located upstream of each constant region (CH) exon cluster, and the IgH intronic enhancer (iEμ) (1Henderson A.

The identification of an additional cis-regulatory region was suspected after mouse cell lines lacking the iEμ enhancer were found to still effectively transcribe IgH genes, and a mouse cell line containing an intact iEμ enhancer but showing a large deletion of sequence downstream of the Cα gene showed decreased IgH transcription (5Birshtein B.K.

Cheng H.L. Alt F.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 737-747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Further experiments involving hs3b and hs4 and Cre/loxP knockouts showed severe impairment of germ-line IH-CH transcription and CSR to IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgE, and IgA, indicating that the distal portion of the regulatory region is required for CSR to most isotypes (14Pinaud E.

The role of the 3′ regulatory region in SHM awaits better definition. The use of a transgenic construct containing murine hs1,2 suggested that this element does not play a role in SHM, even when coupled with the iEμ enhancer (15Tumas-Brundage K.M. Vora K.A. Manser T. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, the use of a transgene construct containing the distal hs3b and hs4 elements, but not hs1,2, resulted in an increase in the SHM level of transgenes driven by a VH promoter, pointing to a role for hs3b and hs4 in SHM (15Tumas-Brundage K.M. Vora K.A. Manser T. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Terauchi A. Hayashi K. Kitamura D. Kozono Y. Motoyama N. Azuma T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, more recent experiments have indicated that hs3b and hs4 are dispensable for SHM and VHDJH gene assembly (17Morvan C.L. Pinaud E. Decourt C. Cuvillier A. Cogne M. Blood. 2003; 102: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The human IgH 3′ regulatory region comprises the B cell-specific DNase I hypersensitivity sites hs1,2, hs3, and hs4, which are arranged in the 5′ hs3-hs1,2-hs4 3′ sequence and duplicated as discrete enhancer clusters 3′ of Cα1 and 3′ of Cα2 (supplementary Fig. S1), with the Cα1 and Cα2 hs1,2 sequences inverted with respect to each other (18Chen C. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1310-1318PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mills F.C. Harindranath N. Mitchell M. Max E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Like their murine counterparts, the human 3′EH hs1,2 and hs4 elements are induced by the Oct-2 transcription factor (trans-factor) and its interacting coactivator Oca-B (6Khamlichi A.A. Pinaud E. Decourt C. Chauveau C. Cogne M. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mouse, negative regulatory mechanisms would not be conserved, as binding sites for B cell-specific activator protein (BSAP), a repressor of the mouse 3′EH hs1,2, are lacking in human hs1,2 (6Khamlichi A.A. Pinaud E. Decourt C. Chauveau C. Cogne M. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Human 3′EH elements have been shown to enhance transcription as driven by a mouse Vκ or Vλ promoter or a human ECS-Iα or ECS-Iγ3 promoter (18Chen C. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1310-1318PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mills F.C. Harindranath N. Mitchell M. Max E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Pan Q.

Hammarstrom L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6380-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Like its murine counterpart, the human 3′EH regulatory region likely functions as an LCR and may play a role in VH gene rearrangement, CSR, and SHM (2Max E.E. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1999: 148-163Google Scholar, 6Khamlichi A.A. Pinaud E. Decourt C. Chauveau C. Cogne M. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To identify the elements involved in the induction of the human IgH 3′ regulatory region, we created hs1,2, hs3, and hs4 enhancer-DNA constructs and 5′, 3′, and internal deletion hs1,2 mutants, and inserted them into luciferase (luc) reporter gene vectors driven by a human VH or ECS-IH promoter. By bearing the luc gene downstream of the promoter and upstream of hs1,2, hs3, or hs4, these vectors mimicked the physiological promoter-gene-enhancer structure found in the IgH locus. In addition, we generated hs1,2 enhancer constructs containing mutations of selected cis-elements and enforced expression of respective trans-factors. Finally, to determine the stages of B cell ontogeny at which the human hs1,2 is activated, we transfected pro-B cells, pre-B cells, early and late germinal center B cells, and plasma cells with a reporter gene vector containing a fully inducible hs1,2 enhancer construct, as driven by the human β-globin promoter. We then measured the enhancement of such a promoter activity and analyzed it with the levels of endogenous germ-line IH-CH and mature VHDJH-CH transcripts, the expression of trans-factors targeting hs1,2, and the formation of specific nucleoprotein complexes. Human IgH 3′ Regulatory Region—The human hs1,2, hs3, and hs4 DNAs were from the 3′EH cluster lying 3′ of the Cα2 exon (19Mills F.C. Harindranath N. Mitchell M. Max E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The 1079-bp hs1,2 DNA spans residues 322–1400 according to the numeration of this genomic clone (GenBank™ accession nos. AF013724 and U84574); the 695-bp hs3 DNA spans residues 526–1221 (GenBank™ accession nos. AF013719 and Y14406); and the 426-bp hs4 DNA spans residues 1–426 (GenBank™ accession no. AF013726). The hs1,2 region 1 G-rich repeats were identified by Pustell DNA matrix analysis (22Pustell J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1813-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), enabling the search for regions of high similarity between two nucleic acid sequences using a dot matrix plot. The human, mouse, rat, and rabbit hs1,2 region 2 sequences were compared using the ClustalW algorithm (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55967) Google Scholar) allowing for multiple alignments of nucleotide sequences. All sequence comparisons were implemented by MacVector, version 6.5.3 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The identification of putative cis-regulatory binding sites was performed using Matlnspector (www.genomatix.de/cgibin/matinspector/matinspector.pl), which utilizes the TRANSFAC library of matrices (www.gene-regulation.de/) to locate consensus matches in nucleotide sequences (24Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar). Vectors—The pGL3-Basic luc-reporter gene vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was modified by inserting three different promoter sequences between the SacI and BglII restriction sites: -449/+265 ECS-Iγ3 promoter DNA (GenBank™ accession no. S79588) (25Schaffer A. Cerutti A. Shah S. Zan H. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5327-5336PubMed Google Scholar), VH1 promoter DNA isolated from the IgG1 mAb57-producing cell line (26Ueki Y.

Casali P. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1325-1337PubMed Google Scholar), or the human β-globin promoter DNA (GenBank™ accession no. U01317). The pGL3 vectors containing the VH1, ECS-Iγ3 or β-globin promoter were further modified by inserting between the BamHI/SalI restriction sites the hs3, hs1,2, and hs4 elements, resulting in the positioning of each 3′EH ∼2 kb downstream of the respective promoter and immediately flanking the firefly luc gene. To generate sequential 5′- and 3′-end truncation mutants, hs1,2 was PCR-amplified using appropriate primers with BamHI/SalI overhangs. Internal hs1,2 deletion mutants were generated by first amplifying 5′- and 3′-halves, minus the targeted sequence, ligating the two fragments, and re-amplifying the “complete” DNA. Ligation of the 5′ and 3′ PCR fragments flanking the targeted motifs generated site-targeted mutations of the 5′ HoxC4 and 3′ HoxC4/Oct-binding sites. The 5′ HoxC4 site (ATTT, residues 715–718) was replaced by cggg. The HoxC4/Oct site (ATTTGCAT, residues 773–780) was replaced with a KpnI restriction site. The double mutant hs1,2 DNA was generated using the single 5′ HoxC4 and 3′ HoxC4/Oct mutants as templates. All digested PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into the pGL3 vectors driven by the VH1 or ECS-Iγ3 promoter. For enforced expression studies, cDNA encoding human HoxC4, Oct-1, Oct-2, or Oca-B was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vectors using the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The pcDNA3.1 expression vector contains a cytomegalovirus promoter for high level expression and a T7 promoter for in vitro translation using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega Corp.). The expression vector encoding the dominant negative HoxC4 lacking the homeodomain was described (28Schaffer A. Kim E.C. Wu X. Zan H. Testoni L. Salamon S. Cerutti A. Casali P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23141-23150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were generated by subcloning human HoxC4, Oct-1, Oct-2, and Oca-B cDNAs into the pGEX-6P-1 vector as described previously (28Schaffer A. Kim E.C.

GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 bacteria, purified using GSH-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed for homogeneity by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Proteins were eluted in 15 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing were used to verify all of the correct plasmids.

HS Sultan is a human IgGκ+ Burkitt's lymphoma with a late germinal center phenotype (34Drexler H.G. MacLeod R.A. Dirks W.G. Blood. 2001; 98: 3495-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). U266 is a human myeloma IgEλ+ cell line (35Nilsson K. Bennich H. Johansson S.G. Ponten J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1970; 7: 477-489PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml, amphotericin B fungizone, Invitrogen). Transfection Assays—B cells (5 × 106) in 0.5 ml of medium in an 0.4-cm cuvette were electroporated using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). All electroporations were performed in duplicate, adhering to the following parameters: 4B6 cells, 210 V, 950 μF; HS Sultan cells, 200 V, 900 μF; and U266 cells, 250 V, 1050 μF. For luc-reporter transient transfections, 10 μg of pGL3-promoter-only and/or pGL3-enhancer-promoter plasmid DNA and 10 ng Renilla pRL-TK control vector (as an internal control for transfection efficiency) were used. For enforced expression studies, pcDNA3.1 expression vector encoding Oct-1, Oct-2, and/or Oca-B (2 μg) were cotransfected with pGL3-promoter-only and/or pGL3-enhancer-promoter plasmid DNA (5 μg), with salmon sperm DNA added to normalize total DNA at 20 μg. RS4;11 and Nalm-6 cells were transfected using Cellfectin following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, plasmid DNA (2 μg) was gently mixed with Cellfectin (15 μl) diluted in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) reduced serum medium. The ensuing DNA-lipid complex solution was used to resuspend 2 × 106 cells. Transfected cells were cultured for 24–48 h. Luc extracts were prepared in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renilla Luc activities were measured using an MLX microtiter plate luminometer (Thermo Labsystems, Beverly, MA). Antibodies—mAbs to Ku70 (Ab-5), Ku86 (Ab-2), and Ku70/Ku86 (Ab-3) were from Lab Vision/NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). The anti-Oct-1 (YL 15) mAb was from Upstate Biotech (Charlottesville, VA) and the anti-HoxC4 mAb from Covance (Princeton, NJ). The rabbit antibodies to Oct-1 (C-21), Oct-2 (C-20), and Oca-B (C-20) as well as rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG to mouse IgG and rabbit IgG were also from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The rabbit IgG to Stat-1 was from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The mouse IgG and mAb to β-actin were from Sigma-Aldrich. EMSAs—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from mammalian cells were prepared using a micro-procedure involving hypotonic lysis followed by high salt nuclei extraction (28Schaffer A. Kim E.C. Wu X. Zan H. Testoni L. Salamon S. Cerutti A. Casali P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23141-23150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whole-cell extracts were prepared using extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.3 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5) and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF) (25Schaffer A. Cerutti A. Shah S. Zan H. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5327-5336PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides encompassing the hs1,2 5′ HoxC4 (residues 704–729) and 3′ HoxC4/Oct (residues 764–789) cis-elements were as follows: 5′ HoxC4 wild type (wt), TCGTGCAAGCTATTTCTGGAAACAGC; 5′ HoxC4 mt4, TCGTGCAAGCTcgggCTGGAAACAGC; 3′ HoxC4/Oct wt, CAAACAACCATTTGCATGTGCCCTGA; 3′ HoxC4/Oct mt5, CAAACAACCcgggtaccGTGCCCTGA, 3′ HoxC4/Oct mt6, CAAACAACCcgggGCATGTGCCCTGA; 3′ HoxC4/Oct mt7, CAAACAACCccTTGCATGTGCCCTGA; and 3′ HoxC4/Oct mt8, CAAACAACCATTTGCcgGTGCCCTGA (underlines denote HoxC4/Oct sites). All reactions were performed as reported (25Schaffer A. Cerutti A. Shah S. Zan H. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5327-5336PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schaffer A. Kim E.C. Wu X. Zan H. Testoni L.

For EMSAs involving GST fusion proteins, 0.25 μg of the GST fusion protein (or GST moiety alone) was incubated, in place of nuclear extracted proteins, with the specified oligonucleotide probe for 20 min. For supershifting EMSA reactions, antibodies were pre-incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min prior to addition of probe (25,000 CPM). All EMSA gels were 7% polyacrylamide and subjected to electrophoresis in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA. Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. Reverse Transcriptase PCRs—Total RNA was extracted from human B cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA syntheses were performed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT)12–18 as primer. HoxC4, Oct-1, Oct-2, Oca-B, and β-actin cDNAs were amplified using the following primers: HoxC4 forward, 5′-ATGGGATCATGAGCTCGTATTTG-3′; HoxC4 reverse, 5′-CTATAACCTGGTAATGTCCTCTGC-3′; Oct-1 forward, 5′-ATGGGGAACAATCCGTCAGAAACCAGTAAA-3′; Oct-1 reverse, 5′-CTACTGTGCCTTGGAGGCGGTGGT-3′; Oct-2 forward, 5′-CAAAATAAGACCTCCCCATTCTCC-3′; Oct-2 reverse, 5′-TTGATGCGGCGTTGCTTGAAGG-3′; Oca-B forward, 5′-CCTCAGTGTTGACCTATGCCTCTC-3′; Oca-B reverse, 5′-TCCTCTTCCTCCAAAAGCAGC-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-GTACCACTGGCATCGTGATGGACT-3′; and β-actin reverse, 5′-ATCCACACGGAGTACTTGCGCTCA-3′. Germ-line IH-CH and mature VHDJ-CH transcripts were detected using specific primers, as reported (28Schaffer A. Kim E.C. Wu X. Zan H. Testoni L. Salamon S. Cerutti A. Casali P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23141-23150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Before each reverse transcriptase PCR, cDNAs were denatured for 5 min at 94 °C. PCRs involved denaturation (1 min at 94 °C), annealing (1 min at 68 °C), and extension (1 min at 72 °C). Western Blot Analysis—Whole human B cell extracts (25 μg) were fractionated through 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted onto poly-vinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) overnight (30 V) at 4 °C and then detected by primary (1:250 to 1:1000) and secondary (1:2500) antibodies. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween (0.05%), bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—B cells (2.5 × 107) were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link chromatin (36Zan H. Wu X. Komori A. Holloman W.K. Casali P. Immunity. 2003; 18: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, chromatin was separated using nuclei-lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Trition-X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% sarkosyl, pH 8.0), resuspended in IP-1 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors), and sonicated to yield 500–1000-bp DNA fragments. These were pre-cleared with agarose beads bearing protein A or G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with mAb to HoxC4, rabbit antibody to Oct-1, Oct-2, or Oca-B, or mAb to Ku70/Ku86 or rabbit antibody to Stat-1 overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were isolated using beads bearing protein A or G, eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, pH 8.0) and then heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the cross-links. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and then solubilized in Tris/EDTA buffer. The recovered DNA was specified using the following primers: forward ChIP 670–689 (5′-TGGGTGGGTGGCGGCTGCAG-3′) and reverse ChIP 812–793 (5′-CTCATTCTGGGCAGACTTGG-3′). DNA was then transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for Southern blotting using the 753–770 5′-TCGGTGTGGAACAAACAA-3′ oligonucleotide as probe. hs1,2 Is the Strongest Enhancer in the Human Cα2 3′Regulatory Region—To address the function of the human IgH 3′ regulatory region, we analyzed the ability of the Cα2 hs1,2, hs3 and hs4 elements to enhance transcription of a luciferase (luc)-reporter gene vector, as driven by a human VH1 promoter, the human ECS-Iγ3 promoter, or the Ig-irrelevant human β-globin promoter, upon transfection of human 4B6 B cells. These cells are IgM+IgD+ and spontaneously switch to IgG, IgA, and IgE. They are the neoplastic equivalent of centroblasts/centrocytes (28Schaffer A. Kim E.C. Wu X. Zan H. Testoni L. Salamon S.

In 4B6 cells, the hs1,2 element was the strongest enhancer of transcription, yielding a 172-fold (VH1 promoter), 100-fold (ECS-Iγ3 promoter), and 77-fold (β-globin promoter) increase in Luc activity; hs4 was second, yielding a 46-fold (VH1 promoter), 10-fold (ECS-Iγ3 promoter), and 15-fold (β-globin promoter) increase in Luc activity, whereas hs3 was the weakest of the three elements, yielding 6-fold (VH1 promoter), 2-f"
https://openalex.org/W2002592372,"Foxa1 is a member of the winged helix family of transcription factors and is expressed in the collecting ducts of the kidney. We investigated its potential contribution to renal physiology in Foxa1-deficient mice on a defined genetic background. Foxa1–/– mice are dehydrated and exhibit electrolyte imbalance as evidenced by elevated hematocrit and plasma urea levels, hypernatremia, and hyperkalemia. This phenotype is the consequence of decreased urine osmolality secondary to renal vasopressin resistance. Mutations of the human genes encoding the vasopressin 2 receptor and aquaporin 2 cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; however, expression of these genes is maintained or increased, respectively, in Foxa1–/– mice. Likewise, expression of the genes encoding the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2), the potassium channel ROMK, the chloride channel CLCNKB, barttin (BSND), and the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), each of which is important in sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle, is maintained or even increased in Foxa1-deficient mice. Thus, we have shown that Foxa1–/– mice represent a new model of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with unique molecular etiology, and we have identified the first transcription factor whose mutation leads to a defect in renal water homeostasis in vivo.

Maintenance of water homeostasis is central to mammalian survival and therefore under tight hormonal and metabolic control. Water homeostasis is achieved by balancing fluid intake with water excretion, governed by the antidiuretic action of arginine-vasopressin (AVP, 1The abbreviations used are: AVP, arginine-vasopressin; DI, diabetes insipidus; P, postnatal day (as in P8); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AQP, aquaporin.1The abbreviations used are: AVP, arginine-vasopressin; DI, diabetes insipidus; P, postnatal day (as in P8); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AQP, aquaporin. also known as antidiuretic hormone, ADH) (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Moore K.

Nephrol. 2003; 7: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Increases in plasma osmolality are sensed by osmoreceptors in the circum-ventricular organ in the anterior hypothalamus. Stimulation of these receptors causes release of AVP from the posterior pituitary. AVP is synthesized and initially secreted as a neurophysin-AVP complex but is uncoupled before it reaches its target, the AVP V2R receptor, on the basolateral surface of tubular cells in the renal collecting ducts.Binding of AVP to its receptor activates adenylate cyclase, leading to elevated intracellular cAMP levels. AVP binding triggers both short term and long term responses. Immediately following activation of the receptor, preexisting stores of the water channel protein aquaporin 2 translocate to the apical surface of the cell, allowing for reabsorption of water from the collecting duct (3Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Water exits the duct cell via the basolaterally located aquaporins 3 and 4, enters the interstitial space, and ultimately returns to the circulation (4Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 5Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Marples D. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F775-F785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over the longer term, elevated cAMP levels lead to activation of protein kinase A and the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein) (6Montminy M.R. Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Thus activated, CREB increases transcription of the aquaporin 2 message and ultimately increases aquaporin 2 protein levels (7Hozawa S. Holtzman E.J. Ausiello D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1695-C1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The central importance of the AVP-aquaporin 2 pathway is most clearly illustrated by the condition of diabetes insipidus (DI), which is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia secondary to a lack of AVP secretion (central DI) or resistance of the kidney to its action (nephrogenic DI, or NDI). Inherited nephrogenic DI can be caused by mutations in the genes encoding either the vasopressin 2 receptor or aquaporin 2, highlighting the central role of these two proteins in the pathway (7Hozawa S.

The ability of the kidney to concentrate urine also depends on the interstitial osmotic gradient, as illustrated by the molecular defects in Bartter's syndrome. In this condition, sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle is impaired as a result of mutations in various ion channels (12Simon D.B. Karet F.E. Hamdan J.M. DiPietro A. Sanjad S.A. Lifton R.P. Nat.

Genet. 1997; 17: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar).The transcription factor Foxa1 was originally identified as the DNA binding protein hepatocyte nuclear factor 3α (HNF3α) and shown to function in hepatic gene regulation (15Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Analysis of the promoter of the rat Foxa1 gene identified binding sites for a kidney-enriched transcription factor and prompted the re-evaluation of the expression domain of Foxa1 (17Peterson R.S. Clevidence D.E. Ye H. Costa R.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 69-82PubMed Google Scholar). Foxa1 transcripts were localized to the collecting duct in embryonic and adult kidney. Data base analysis identified potential Foxa1 binding sites in the promoters of several genes prominently expressed in the kidney, including the vasopressin receptor and several subunits of the Na,K-ATPase (17Peterson R.S. Clevidence D.E. Ye H. Costa R.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 69-82PubMed Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to evaluate the renal physiology of mice deficient for Foxa1. Here we show that Foxa1–/– mice exhibit all of the hallmarks of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, identifying the Foxa1 gene as the first transcription factor whose inactivation results in a defect in renal water homeostasis.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—The derivation of the Foxa1–/– mice has been described previously (18Kaestner K.H. Katz J. Liu Y. Drucker D.J. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The mutation has since been backcrossed for 12 generations to the C57BL/6 and 129SvEv inbred mouse strains to obtain incipient congenic lines. All mutant mice were analyzed on postnatal day 8 (P8) as F1 hybrids (C57BL/6 × 129SvEv) along with littermate controls. Using F1 hybrids has the advantage of hybrid vigor by complementation of recessive mutations from parental strains (19Silver L. Mouse Genetics: Concepts and Applications. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The F1 hybrid is a defined genetic background, as all mice are genetically uniform with the exception of the Foxa1 locus. Mice were housed in 12-h light/dark cycles and fed standard rodent chow ad libitum. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pennsylvania.Blood and Urine Chemistry—Trunk blood and urine were collected from P8 mice after sacrifice by decapitation. Blood and urine chemistries were determined at Anilytics Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Urine osmolality was determined using an Advanced Micro osmometer (Advanced Instrument Inc., Norwood, MA).Histology and Immunofluorescence—For histology, kidneys were collected from fetuses (day 17.5 postcoitum), on postnatal day 1, and on postnatal day 8. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, tissues were paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunofluorescence, coronal sections of mouse kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in 5% sucrose in PBS for 1 h. The tissue was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in 5% sucrose, PBS for 10 min. After washing twice with 5% sucrose, PBS, the tissue was immersed in graded sucrose/PBS solutions to a final sucrose concentration of 2.3 m for cryoprotection. Blocks of tissue were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), diluted 1:2 with 20% sucrose, frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Tissue sections (4 μm) were cut by using a Reichter-Jung cryostat (model 2800) and collected on Probe-on-Plus (Fisher) microscope slides.Sections were hydrated with PBS, blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated for 3 h with an antiaquaporin 2 (anti-AQP2) antibody (stock, 0.2 mg/ml) raised in rabbit (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) diluted 1:25 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100. Slides were then washed three times for 5 min with PBS and incubated in the dark for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of Texas Red-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs).Immunofluorescence localization with one of the following primary antibodies to AQP3, AQP4, Na,K-ATPase α subunit, ROMK, Tamm Horsfall, and NKCC2 was conducted in a manner similar to the anti-AQP2 staining above with the noted exceptions below. Anti-AQP3 fraction 3 antibody (stock, 0.2 mg/ml) raised in rabbit (a generous gift from Mark Knepper) was diluted 1:100 in PBS, and anti-AQP4 antibody (stock, 0.2 mg/ml) raised in rabbit (Alomone Labs) was diluted 1:100. Anti-Na,K-ATPase α subunit antibody (stock, 1 mg/ml) raised in rabbit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was diluted 1:200, and anti-ROMK antibody (stock, 0.24 mg/ml) raised in rabbit (Alomone Labs) was diluted 1:15. Anti-Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein antibody that recognizes TALH (stock, 0.05 mg/ml) raised in goat (ICN Cappel Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH) was diluted 1:1000, and slides were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Anti-NKCC2 antibody (stock, 0.25 mg/ml) raised in rabbit (a generous gift from Mark Knepper) was diluted 1:100. The slides were washed three times and incubated with Texas Red anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a 1:100 dilution as described above for anti-AQP2 staining to label anti-AQP3, anti-AQP4, and anti-NKCC2 antibodies. Texas Red anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:200 was used for the anti-Na,K-ATPase α subunit, and a 1:400 dilution was used for anti-ROMK visualization. Texas Red-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) at a 1:100 dilution was used to incubate the slides in the dark for 1 h to visualize the anti-Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein labeling. Control experiments consisted of either omitting the primary antibodies or substituting the primary antibody with non-immune chicken or rabbit antibody, as appropriate. All controls were negative for specific primary antibody labeling. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Microphot-FX microscope with a CoolSNAP digital camera (Roper Scientific).Vasopressin Injections—[Arg8]Vasopressin acetate salt was purchased from Sigma. Four μg of vasopressin/kg of body weight were injected intraperitoneally in a total volume of 50 μl of 0.9% saline. Two h after injection the mice were sacrificed by decapitation, and the urine was usually collected by puncturing the bladder after a surgical incision of the abdominal wall.RNA Analysis—We isolated RNA from whole kidney of postnatal day 8 mice using the ToTALLY RNA kit (Ambion). RNase protection and quantitative PCR were performed as described previously (18Kaestner K.H. Katz J. Liu Y. Drucker D.J. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Sund N.J. Ang S.L. Sackett S.D. Shen W. Daigle N. Magnuson M.A. Kaestner K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5175-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We reverse transcribed RNA using random hexamers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described previously (21Lee C.S. Sund N.J. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Matschinsky F.M. Stoffers D.A. Kaestner K.H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2546-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We designed primers and performed quantitative real time PCR analysis in triplicate on a Stratagene Mx4000 Multiplex quantitative PCR system using Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR reagents (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primer sequences are available on request.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFoxa1-deficient Mice Are Dehydrated—During the initial characterization of Foxa1–/– mice, we had noticed the dehydrated appearance of the mutant pups in addition to their hypoglycemic phenotype (18Kaestner K.H. Katz J. Liu Y. Drucker D.J. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, we analyzed blood chemistries of these mice on a defined genetic background to minimize the variability of the phenotype. Heterozygous mice were backcrossed to both 129SvEv and C57BL/6 inbred strains of mice for more than 10 generations to derive incipient congenic strains with greater than 99% homozygosity, and all mutants were analyzed in F1 matings between the two parental strains to ensure genetic homogeneity (see “Materials and Methods” for details). The hematocrit, plasma urea, sodium, and potassium in postnatal day 8 mutant mice were all elevated in comparison with littermate controls (Fig. 1, A–D). Thus, Foxa1–/– mice were significantly dehydrated and displayed elevated plasma osmolality. However, plasma creatinine levels were normal, excluding the possibility of global renal failure (Fig. 1E).As water balance is maintained by controlling both fluid intake and water excretion, we first considered the possibility that Foxa1–/– mice might not drink sufficiently. However, we frequently found milk in the stomach of these mice, making this unlikely (data not shown). Next we considered that the Foxa1 mutant mice might not be able to concentrate urine to a sufficient degree to prevent water loss. When we determined urine osmolality, we indeed found that Foxa1–/– mice have significantly more dilute urine than their control littermates, despite the fact that they are dehydrated (Fig. 2A). We confirmed this finding using two other measures. Kidney weight was significantly increased in Foxa1–/– mice, despite the fact that these mice are smaller than their littermates, indicative of water retention (Fig. 2B). Polyuria was suggested by the presence of dilated collecting ducts in Foxa1–/– mice as determined by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to aquaporin 2 (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, Foxa1 mice failed to concentrate urine in the face of severe dehydration.Fig. 2Foxa1-deficient mice exhibit reduced urine osmolality and hydronephrosis. All data were obtained from postnatal day 8 mice of both sexes. The number of animals in each genotype group is indicated in parentheses. Statistical significance between wild type and mutant groups was determined by Student's t test. ***, p < 0.001. A, urine osmolality is reduced in mutant mice compared with littermate controls despite the volume depletion evident in these mice. B, kidney weight is increased in Foxa1–/– mice consistent with hydronephrosis. C, immunofluorescent detection of aquaporin 2 protein in postnatal day 8 wild type mice indicates that most tubules have a small diameter (yellow arrow), indicating limited renal urine volume. D, immunofluorescent detection of aquaporin 2 protein in postnatal day 8 Foxa1–/– mice indicates dilation of the tubules secondary to hydronephrosis (green arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Foxa1–/–Mice Have Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus—As Foxa1 has been shown to be expressed in the developing central nervous system as well as the kidney (17Peterson R.S.

Development. 1993; 118: 47-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that Foxa1–/– mice might suffer from central diabetes insipidus. Therefore, we investigated whether expression of arginine-vasopressin in the hypothalamus is dependent on Foxa1. We isolated total RNA from the hypothalami of P8 control and mutant mice and determined the expression of the AVP message by RNase protection assay (data not shown) and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3, AVP mRNA is still expressed in the hypothalamus of Foxa1–/– mice; in fact, its expression is increased 2.5-fold over controls (p < 0.05). This increase in the AVP message is likely not a direct effect of Foxa1 deficiency in the hypothalamus, i.e. the removal of Foxa1 as a transcriptional repressor of the AVP gene, but rather a response of the hypothalamus to the state of dehydration. Osmotic stimulation and water retention have been shown previously to increase AVP expression in the hypothalamus (25Zingg H.H. Lefebvre D. Almazan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12956-12959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 3Expression of AVP mRNA is increased in Foxa1–/– mice.A, hypothalamic RNA from wild type and Foxa1–/– mice was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR with primers specific to vasopressin (VP) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) as an internal control as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, radioactivity in the bands shown in A was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis to determine the -fold change in vasopressin expression in Foxa1–/– mice. Vasopressin was normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, and data are expressed as mean ± S.E., with n = 6 for control and n = 4 for the mutant mice. Statistical significance between wild type and mutant groups was determined by Student's t test. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next we investigated whether the diabetes insipidus of Foxa1–/– mice could be nephrogenic. To address this question, we injected both control and Foxa1–/– mice with AVP and determined urine osmolality 2 h later. As shown in Fig. 4, injection of AVP into P8 control mice led to a significant increase in urine osmolality compared with saline-injected controls, demonstrating for the first time that preweaning mice have the capacity to concentrate urine in response to AVP. In contrast, Foxa1–/– mice showed no response to exogenous AVP (Fig. 4). Thus, Foxa1–/– mice showed all of the hallmarks of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Given the facts that Foxa1 is expressed in many other tissues besides the kidney (22Monaghan A.P. Kaestner K.H. Grau E. Schutz G. Development. 1993; 119: 567-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that Foxa1–/– mice display multiple metabolic defects (18Kaestner K.H. Katz J. Liu Y. Drucker D.J. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), it is possible that the renal phenotype described here is an indirect consequence of the overall metabolic state of the animals.Fig. 4Foxa1–/– mice exhibit nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. All data were obtained from postnatal day 8 mice of both sexes. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with either saline or AVP at a concentration of 4 μg/kg, and urine osmolality was determined 2 h later as described under “Materials and Methods.” Control mice show a significant increase in urine osmolality in response to AVP (p < 0.01; Student's t test), whereas Foxa1–/– mice are completely refractory to AVP administration.

Clevidence D.E. Ye H. Costa R.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 69-82PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether the expression of these genes might be altered in Foxa1–/– mice. We developed specific probes for the vasopressin V2R receptor and aquaporins 1–3 as well as all of the subunits of the Na,K-ATPase and measured their mRNA levels by RNase protection assay (Fig. 5 and data not shown). As is demonstrated in Fig. 5A, expression of the vasopressin 2 receptor and aquaporin 1 is unchanged in Foxa1–/– mice. Interestingly, mRNA levels for both aquaporin 2 (apical membrane) and aquaporin 3 (basolateral membrane) are increased ∼3-fold in Foxa1 mutant mice (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, a deficiency in vasopressin receptor or aquaporin gene expression cannot be the cause for the defect in water retention in Foxa1 mutant mice. In fact, the increased renal expression of aquaporin 2 documents that both sensing of and response to dehydration by the AVP-aquaporin system are intact in Foxa1–/– mice. In addition, expression of all of the subunits of the Na,K-ATPase was maintained in Foxa1-deficient mice (data not shown).Fig. 5Foxa1–/– mice have increased renal expression of aquaporins 2 and 3. Total kidney RNA was isolated from P8 control and mutant mice and subjected to RNase protection assay with probes specific to the vasopressin 2 receptor and aquaporins 1–3 as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, autoradiogram of RNase protection assay for vasopressin 2 receptor (VR) and aquaporin 1 (AQP1).

Bartter's syndrome is characterized by electrolyte imbalance and severe polyuria. So far, five genes expressed in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop in the kidney have been demonstrated to contribute to the interstitial solute concentration. These encode the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2), the potassium channel ROMK, the β subunit of the chloride channels ClC-KA and ClC-KB, barttin (BSND), the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), and the chloride channel CLCNKB (12Simon D.B.

To investigate whether any of these genes might be dependent on Foxa1 and thus contribute to the Foxa1 mutant phenotype, we determined their transcript levels by quantitative real time PCR. As shown in Fig. 6, expression of ROMK, BSND, and the calcium-sensing receptor was not changed, whereas NKCC2 and CLCNKB were up-regulated by 69% (p < 0.0005) and 154% (p < 0.02), respectively, in Foxa1-deficient kidneys. As discussed above for the changes in aquaporin 2 and 3 levels, we propose that these increases are not direct transcriptional responses to Foxa1 but rather an attempt by the kidney to compensate for the water loss. In addition, no significant differences in immunofluorescent localization of AQP3, AQP4, Na,K-ATPase α subunit, Tamm Horsfall protein, and NKCC2 were seen between the wild type and the Foxa1-deficient kidneys (data not shown).Fig. 6Expression of ion channel and transporter genes in Foxa1 mutant mice.

https://openalex.org/W2003801270,"Previous studies have suggested that the conformation of the activation peptide of protein C is influenced by the binding of Ca2+. To provide direct evidence for the linkage between Ca2+ binding and the conformation of the activation peptide, we have constructed a protein C mutant in the γ-carboxyglutamic acid-domainless form in which the P1 Arg169 of the activation peptide is replaced with the fluorescence reporter Trp. Upon binding of Ca2+, the intrinsic fluorescence of the mutant decreases ∼30%, as opposed to only 5% for the wild-type, indicating that Trp169 is directly influenced by the divalent cation. The Kd of Ca2+ binding for the mutant protein C was impaired ∼4-fold compared with wild-type. Interestingly, the conformation of the activation peptide was also found to be sensitive to the binding of Na+, and the affinity for Na+ binding increased ∼5-fold in the presence of Ca2+. These findings suggest that Ca2+ changes the conformation of the activation peptide of protein C and that protein C is also capable of binding Na+, although with a weaker affinity compared with the mature protease. The mutant protein C can no longer be activated by thrombin but remarkably it can be activated efficiently by chymotrypsin and by the thrombin mutant D189S. Activation of the mutant protein C by chymotrypsin proceeds at a rate comparable to the activation of wild-type protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex.

Activation of the mutant protein C by chymotrypsin proceeds at a rate comparable to the activation of wild-type protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Protein C is a multidomain vitamin K-dependent serine protease zymogen in plasma, which, upon activation by the complex of thrombin and thrombomodulin (TM), 1The abbreviations used are: TM, thrombomodulin; R169W, protein C mutant in which Arg169 at the P1 position (in the nomenclature of Ref. 32Schechter I.

Deaven L.L. Majerus P.W. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4350-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Activated protein C has a light and a heavy chain held together by a single disulfide bond, with the N-terminal light chain containing the non-catalytic γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain and two epidermal growth factor-like domains (4Plutzky J. Hoskins J. Long G.L. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of activated protein C is located in the C-terminal heavy chain of the molecule (6Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and contains functionally critical and conformationally linked binding sites for both Na+ and Ca2+ (7Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8He X. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4970-4976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ binding site is located in the 70-loop (chymotrypsin numbering (9Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar)) by analogy with trypsin (10Bode W. Schwager P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 693-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and optimizes the catalytic activity of the protease (11Amphlett G.W. Kisiel W. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2156-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Hill K.A. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 140-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to the 70-loop is also required for the rapid activation of protein C by the thrombin-TM complex, whereas such binding inhibits the conversion to activated protein C in the absence of TM (13Esmon N.L. DeBault L.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5548-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11701-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these and other observations, it has been postulated that binding of Ca2+ to the 70-loop of protein C changes the conformation of the activation peptide of the zymogen in a way that promotes cleavage by thrombin in the presence but not the absence of TM (1Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12221-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence for the Ca2+-induced conformational change in the activation peptide of protein C has been presented so far. In addition to a Ca2+ binding site in the 70-loop, the catalytic domain of activated protein C possesses a functionally important Na+ binding site between the 220- and 186-loops as in other clotting proteases carrying Tyr or Phe at position 225 (8He X. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4970-4976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J.

A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the Ca2+ and Na+ binding sites of activated protein C are allosterically linked (8He X. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4970-4976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether Na+ binds to the zymogen protein C and is capable of eliciting effects of functional significance, including a linkage with the Ca2+ binding site in the 70-loop that is so critical for the conversion to activated protein C by the thrombin-TM complex. To address these questions, we have constructed a mutant of protein C with the P1 Arg169 of the activation peptide replaced by a Trp. The introduction of the fluorophore at position 169 eliminates the site of cleavage by thrombin and provides a direct probe for monitoring the effect of cation binding on the conformation of the activation peptide. Construction and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Construction, expression, and purification of wild-type protein C in the γ-carboxyglutamic acid-domainless form (GD-protein C) in the RSV-PL4 expression purification vector system has been described previously (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P1 Arg169 to Trp (R169W) mutant of protein C was constructed by PCR mutagenesis methods and expressed in the same vector system in HEK293 cells as described (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both wild-type and mutant protein C were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody, HPC4, linked to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) as described (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following purification to homogeneity, both wild-type and mutant protein C were desalted by passing through a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Chelex-treated (Bio-Rad) 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and stored at –80 °C. Following activation by chymotrypsin or thrombin D189S, the activated GD-PC mutant exhibited identical amidolytic activity toward Spectrozyme PCa suggesting that a Trp at the C-terminal end of the light chain does not alter the catalytic property of the mutant protein. The expression, purification, and characterization of the GD-PC mutant in which the Na+-binding loop of the zymogen from residues Gly221 to Tyr225 was replaced with the corresponding sequence of trypsin (GD-PC trypsin loop) has been described previously (8He X. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4970-4976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The expression, purification, and characterization of the Asp189 to Ser substitution mutant of thrombin (D189S) has been described previously (19Prasad S. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Shih P. Xu H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and antithrombin (21Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were expressed in mammalian cells and purified to homogeneity as described in the cited methods. Bovine α-chymotrypsin and hirudin were purchased from Sigma, and Spectrozyme PCa was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Zymogen Activation—The initial rates of concentration dependence of wild-type and R169W GD-PC activation by thrombin or chymotrypsin were monitored in both the absence and presence of Na+ and Ca2+ as described (22Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12051-12056Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The activation reactions were carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl (TBS) or 0.1 m choline chloride containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% PEG 8000. In both cases, the activation of wild-type GD-PC (0.3–10 μm) by thrombin (5–50 nm) and R169W (0.3–10 μm) by chymotrypsin (1 nm) was monitored in the absence or presence of 2.5 mm Ca2+ for 5–30 min at room temperature. After inhibition of thrombin activity by antithrombin, the initial rates of activations were measured from the rate of activated protein C generation in an amidolytic activity assay using 400 μm Spectrozyme PCa in TBS as described (22Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12051-12056Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions used for the activation of GD-PC R169W, chymotrypsin did not exhibit a measurable amidolytic activity toward Sectrozyme PCa. The rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm at room temperature in a Vmax kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The concentration of active protein C in each reaction was determined by reference to a standard curve, which was prepared by total activation of each protein C derivative at the time of experiments. This was accomplished by activation of 1–2.5 μm wild-type GD-PC with 10 nm wild-type thrombin in complex with 500 nm TM456 and R169W GD-PC with 100 nm thrombin D189S in complex with 500 nm TM456 in TBS containing 2.5 mm Ca2+ for 2–4 h at 37 °C. Under these conditions both zymogens were completely activated to their enzymatic forms. The Km and kcat values were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation. The initial rate of concentration dependence of GD-PC R169W activation was also evaluated by the thrombin D189S mutant. In this case, GD-PC R169W (0.8–25 μm) was activated by the thrombin mutant (50 nm) in complex with TM456 (500 nm) in TBS containing 2.5 mm Ca2+. After 10–20 min of incubation at room temperature, the activity of thrombin D189S was inhibited by hirudin (200 nm), and the rate of activated protein C generation was measured by an amidolytic activity assay as described above. The TM456 dependence of GD-PC activation suggested that the TM456 concentration was saturating under these conditions. The initial rate of the activation of the protein C mutant by the thrombin mutant was also measured in the absence of TM in both the absence and presence of Ca2+. In this case, the activation conditions were the same as above except that the concentration dependence of the zymogen activation was monitored for 3 h at room temperature in TBS containing either 5 mm EDTA or 5 mm Ca2+. Fluorescence Measurements—Direct binding of Na+ and Ca2+ to protein C derivatives was evaluated from the changes in the intrinsic protein fluorescence associated with the binding of the cations to the zymogens. Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined by fluorescence titration with a Spex FluoroMax-3 spectrophotometer (Jobin-Yvon, Edison, NJ). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 345 nm, respectively. The titration experiments with monovalent cations were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% PEG 8000 at an ionic strength of 800 mm at 25 °C as described (19Prasad S. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Shih P. Xu H. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10103-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Titrations were carried out by adding aliquots of wild-type or R169W GD-PC (1 μm) in solution containing [M+] = 800 mm Cl– salt to a solution containing the same concentration of each zymogen in 800 mm choline chloride. Monovalent cation binding profiles were obtained in both the absence (1 mm EDTA) and presence of 2.5 mm CaCl2. In all titrations, the ionic strength, protein concentration and [Cl–] of the samples were held constant, whereas the monovalent cations [M+] were varied. The Ca2+ binding titrations were carried out in 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C as described (15Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12221-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The values of the intrinsic fluorescence (F) for the protein C derivatives as a function of each metal ion concentration [M] were fit according to the equation (19Prasad S. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Shih P. Xu H. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10103-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), F=Fo+F1[M]Kd,M1+[M]Kd,M(Eq. 1) where Fo and F1 are the values of fluorescence in the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of the monovalent or divalent cations and Kd,M is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the metal ion binding. Protein C Activation—GD-PC activation by thrombin in both the absence and presence of TM and Ca2+ has been extensively studied in the past (13Esmon N.L. DeBault L.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5548-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that Ca2+, in the presence of TM, accelerates protein C or GD-PC activation by thrombin but functions as a potent inhibitor of protein C activation in the absence of TM (1Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, Ca2+ inhibited GD-PC activation by thrombin in the absence of TM in the presence or absence of Na+ (Fig. 1). Individual Michaelis-Menten parameters could not be resolved in the presence of Ca2+ up to 10 μm GD-PC. However, Km and kcat values of 10 ± 3 μm and 3.0 ± 0.4 nm/min/nm for GD-PC activation by thrombin in the absence of Ca2+ were obtained in NaCl- and choline chloride-containing buffers (Table I). GD-PC activation in the presence of a saturating concentration of TM456 showed similar catalytic rates in NaCl- and choline chloride-containing buffers, confirming that the activation of protein C by thrombin does not require Na+ (23Wells C.M.

Open table in a new tab The R169W mutant of GD-PC was not activated by thrombin in either the absence or presence of Ca2+ or TM but was activated by chymotrypsin with comparable rates in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and/or Na+ (Fig. 2, Table I). Remarkably, the Km and kcat values for the activation of mutant GD-PC by chymotrypsin in the presence of Ca2+ (5.3 μm and 13.1 min–1, Table I) were the same as those obtained for wild type GD-PC activation by the thrombin-TM complex in the presence of Ca2+ (6.8 μm and 13.8 min–1 (22Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12051-12056Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). Both the Km and kcat values for the mutant GD-PC activation by chymotrypsin in the absence of Ca2+ and Na+ were reduced ∼3-fold (Table I). Because chymotrypsin does not bind Ca2+ or Na+, the effects on the kinetic parameters must be due to cations binding to the substrate. The effect of Ca2+ on the mutant protein C activation by chymotrypsin was more pronounced in the absence of Na+, suggesting that the binding of Ca2+ and Na+ elicits distinct conformational changes around the P1 residue of the activation peptide that are detected by chymotrypsin. The activation of the mutant GD-PC was also studied in the presence of the thrombin mutant D189S, where the residue in the primary specificity site was converted to that of chymotrypsin. Under saturating conditions of TM456, activation required Ca2+ with a half-maximal value of 90 ± 12 μm (Fig. 3A) as opposed to 15 μm seen for wild-type thrombin (25Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10484-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the R169W mutation has affected the ability of protein C to interact with Ca2+. The Michaelis-Menten curve for activation of the mutant GD-PC by the thrombin mutant D189S in the presence of TM456 also indicates a drastically increased Km relative to wild-type (Fig. 3B). In the absence of TM, the thrombin mutant showed negligible catalytic activity toward the mutant GD-PC. The value of kcat/Km toward the mutant GD-PC was ∼250-fold slower compared with wild type for the thrombin mutant and also ∼310-fold slower compared with chymotrypsin. Hence, the thrombin mutant D189S in the presence of TM shows significant activity toward the mutant GD-PC, as opposed to the complete absence of activity of the wild-type, but it is not as active as chymotrypsin. This observation strongly suggests that thrombin, unlike chymotrypsin, has structural determinants that undermine its ability to interact efficiently with protein C and that part of this defect is the inability of protein C to penetrate the primary specificity pocket of thrombin. The defect is corrected by interaction with TM through a mechanism that remains to be identified. Fluorescence Measurements—Binding of Ca2+ to GD-PC caused an ∼5% decrease in intrinsic fluorescence, as previously reported (15Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12221-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with a Kd of 26.6 μm (Fig. 4). On the other hand, binding of Ca2+ to the mutant GD-PC decreased the intrinsic fluorescence ∼30%, with a Kd of 111 μm. The more pronounced change in intrinsic fluorescence can be assigned to the introduction of Trp169 in the mutant protein C. An important conclusion from this observation is that Ca2+ binding to GD-PC induces a conformational change in the activation peptide. The weaker Ca2+ affinity of the mutant indicates that the P1 residue of the activation peptide is linked energetically to the Ca2+ binding site in the zymogen. These results are in agreement with previous mutagenesis data where substitution of the P3, P2, or P3′ residues of the activation peptide also impaired the Ca2+ affinity of the mutant proteins (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1994; 83: 2526-2531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the conformation of the activation peptide was also influenced by Na+ binding. Na+ enhanced the intrinsic fluorescence of the mutant GD-PC ∼9% in the absence of Ca2+, with a Kd of ∼285 mm (Fig. 5A). The Na+ effect was abrogated by replacement of the 220-loop of protein C with that of trypsin, as seen for activated protein C (8He X. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4970-4976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). K+ binding showed an even higher affinity (Kd = 104 mm) and a similar change in intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, Li+ did not elicit any fluorescence change. The presence of Ca2+ increased the affinity for Na+ ∼5-fold and for K+ ∼2-fold, and both monovalent cations caused a decrease in intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 5B, Table II). These results suggest that the Ca2+ and Na+ binding sites are energetically linked not only in activated protein C but also in the zymogen.Table IIKd (in mm) for interaction of wild-type and R169W GD-PC with monovalent cationsNa+K+Li+-Ca2++Ca2+-Ca2++Ca2+-Ca2++Ca2+WT660 ± 14111 ± 29314 ± 1330 ± 1628 ± 27142 ± 58R169W285 ± 4059 ± 14104 ± 660 ± 9NDaND, less than 1% change in intrinsic protein fluorescence was observed in the absence of Ca2+.101 ± 30a ND, less than 1% change in intrinsic protein fluorescence was observed in the absence of Ca2+. Open table in a new tab Similar to Ca2+, the effect of the monovalent cations can be directly attributed to changes in the environment/conformation of the P1 Trp169 in the activation peptide of the mutant protein because the metal ions exhibited opposite effects with the wild-type GD-PC, thus decreasing the emission intensity in the absence of Ca2+ 10–35% depending on the metal ion (Fig. 6A). In the presence of Ca2+, the decrease in protein fluorescence of GD-PC varied from ∼5 to 25% for the monovalent cations (Fig. 6B). The Kd values for interaction with the metal ions under different conditions are presented in Table II. The results presented here shed light on how Ca2+ enhances activation of protein C by thrombin in the presence of TM. Ca2+ influences the conformation of the activation peptide of protein C and perhaps makes it more complementary to the active site of thrombin. There are several lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis: 1) the molecular modeling data based on the crystal structures of the protease domain of activated protein C and chymotrypsinogen have predicted electrostatic interactions between the charged residues of the activation peptide and those of the 70-loop (27Knobe K. Berntsdotter A. Shen L. Morser J. Dahlbäck B. Villoutreix B.O. Proteins. 1999; 35: 218-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Perera L. Foley C. Darden T.A. Stafford D. Mather T. Esmon C.T. Pedersen L.G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2925-2943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), 2Walker F.J. Fay P.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) the mutagenesis of residues surrounding the scissile bond is associated with changes in the affinity of mutant zymogens for binding Ca2+ (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1994; 83: 2526-2531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 3) it is known that the GD-PC zymogen but not activated GD-PC undergoes a 5 ± 1% quenching in the intrinsic protein fluorescence upon binding Ca2+ (15Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12221-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results together with kinetic data have supported the hypothesis that the conformations of the activation peptide and the Ca2+-binding 70-loop of protein C are allosterically linked. Nevertheless, direct evidence for this hypothesis was missing until now because the Trp residues responsible for reporting the intrinsic fluorescence of GD-PC upon binding Ca2+ have been mapped to the two Trp residues 231 and 234 (76 and 79 in chymotrypsin numbering), which are both located in the Ca2+ loop of the zymogen (15Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12221-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the 5% fluorescence quenching of GD-PC upon interaction with Ca2+ could not have been directly attributed to changes in the conformation of the activation peptide of the zymogen. The observation of this study that the binding of Ca2+ is associated with a markedly higher quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence (∼30%) of the P1 R169W mutant directly establishes for the first time that the conformation of the activation peptide of protein C is altered upon interaction with Ca2+. The observation that the affinity of the R169W mutant for binding Ca2+ (111 μm) is impaired ∼4-fold shows that these two sites are energetically linked. This study also demonstrates that the Na+ binding site of activated protein C is partially folded in the zymogen form and retains the cation selectivity (K+ > Na+ > Li+) of the mature protease (29Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4609-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar to Ca2+, binding of Na+ to the 220-loop of protein C elicits changes in the activation peptide. Furthermore, binding of Na+ to protein C, though weaker than to activated protein C, is positively linked to the Ca2+ site as in the mature protease. It is well established that the interaction of Na+ with thrombin promotes the procoagulant and signaling functions of the enzyme, but has no effect on the activation of protein C (24Dang Q.D.

Consistent with this key property of thrombin, activation of GD-PC in the absence or presence of saturating TM456 occurred with similar catalytic efficiency in either Na+- or choline-containing buffer, suggesting that the Na+-induced conformational change of the activation peptide may be functionally irrelevant to protein C activation. The role of Na+ binding to protein C seems to be related to the positive linkage with Ca2+ binding to the 70-loop of the zymogen, which in turn ensures efficient activation of protein C by the thrombin-TM complex. Hence, although both Ca2+ and Na+ influence the conformation of the activation peptide of protein C, only Ca2+ produces a better substrate for cleavage by the thrombin-TM complex. Therefore the two cations produce distinct functional changes in the conformation of the activation peptide, although their binding interactions are energetically linked. A noteworthy observation of this study was that chymotrypsin activates the P1 Trp169 mutant of GD-PC with essentially the same efficiency as the thrombin-TM456 complex activates wild-type GD-PC. It is unclear whether the chymotrypsin specificity toward the mutant GD-PC arises exclusively from the P1 site of cleavage. Future mutagenesis studies of chymotrypsin should clarify whether the protease exploits additional interacting sites in its interaction with the mutant GD-PC. In the case of thrombin, a conversion of the primary specificity site to that of chymotrypsin with the D189S mutation produces a derivative capable of activating the mutant GD-PC but with a specificity >300-fold lower compared than that of chymotrypsin. In addition, efficient cleavage of the mutant GD-PC still requires saturating amounts of TM and Ca2+. These observations have the obvious implication that the conformation of protein C is potentially suitable for efficient activation and that no action is likely required of TM on protein C to optimize interaction with the thrombin active site. It is still possible, however, that TM provides facilitated diffusion of protein C into the thrombin active site (30Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which is hindered by structural constraints not present in chymotrypsin. Possible structural determinants preventing thrombin from cleaving protein C efficiently in the absence of TM are the extended binding pocket residues like Glu192, Arg35, and other residues that are not conserved in chymotrypsin. In agreement with this hypothesis, mutagenesis of either Glu192 (31Le Bonniec B.F. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7371-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or Arg35 (22Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12051-12056Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has dramatically improved the rate of protein C activation by mutant thrombins independent of TM. It would be of interest to assess whether introduction of these residues into chymotrypsin produces a derivative that mimics thrombin in its interaction with the mutant GD-PC."

The similarity of its fold, with the inner core structure of PGIs from eubacterial and eukaryotic sources, confirms this enzyme as a member of the PGI superfamily. The almost total conservation of amino acids in the active site, including the glutamate base catalyst, shows that PaPGI/PMI uses the same catalytic mechanisms for both ring opening and isomerization for the interconversion of glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) to fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P). The lack of structural differences between native and inhibitor-bound enzymes suggests this activity occurs without any of the conformational changes that are the hallmark of the well characterized PGI family. The lack of a suitable second base in the active site of PaPGI/PMI argues against a PMI mechanism involving a trans-enediol intermediate. Instead, PMI activity may be the result of additional space in the active site imparted by a threonine, in place of a glutamine in other PGI enzymes, which could permit rotation of the C-2—C-3 bond of mannose 6-phosphate.

EC 5.3.1.9) catalyzes the interconversion of d-glucose 6-phosphate to d-fructose 6-phosphate via an aldose-ketose isomerization reaction. This equilibrium reaction is part of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis but also impacts other pathways in sugar metabolism such as the pentose phosphate pathway. The enzyme from bacterial and mammalian sources has been well characterized. Crystal structures show the enzyme to be a tight homodimer in which the two active sites are located at the domain interface and are formed by elements from both subunits (1Sun Y.J. Chou C.C.

These structures support a catalytic mechanism for isomerization in which a glutamate (e.g. Glu-357 in rabbit PGI) acts as a base catalyst to remove a proton from C-1 or C-2 (depending on the direction of the reaction), forming a cis-enediolate intermediate. Because the open chain forms of its substrates are expected to be present in vivo in trace amounts (4Swenson C.A. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3151-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), PGI also catalyzes a ring-opening reaction. This reaction is acid-catalyzed by a histidine (e.g. His-388 in rabbit PGI) (5Lee J.H. Chang K.Z. Patel V. Jeffery C.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7799-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Davies C. Muirhead H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and a lysine (Lys-518) also appears to assist this reaction by abstracting a proton from C-1 of Glc-6-P (or C-2 of Fru-6-P) (7Solomons J.T. Burns S. Wessner L. Krishnamurthy N. Zimmerly E. Swan M.K. Krings S. Muirhead H. Chirgwin J. Davies C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences homologous with PGI cannot be recognized readily within the genomes of Archaea. In some species, such as the euryarchaeons Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis, PGI activity appears to be catalyzed by a novel enzyme that is structurally and mechanistically distinct from the PGI superfamily (8Verhees C.H.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of this protein from P. furiosus show it to contain a cupin fold (11Berrisford J.M. Akerboom J. Turnbull A.P. DeGeus D. Sedelnikova S.E. Staton I. McLeod C.W. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Baker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33290-33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) at the heart of which is a metal ion that is believed to mediate a hydride shift mechanism of catalysis (12Swan M.K.

An interesting facet of this structure is the lack of any obvious amino acids that might catalyze ring opening, leading to suggestions that, in the extremely high temperatures in which P. furiosus thrives, the proportions of sugars in their straight chain form is sufficient to support the demands of metabolism (12Swan M.K. Solomons J.T. Beeson C.C. Hansen T. Schonheit P. Davies C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47261-47268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In some aerobic crenarchaeota, genes are present in which sequence similarity to some, but not all, of the highly conserved active site motifs of PGI can be detected, suggesting that, unlike the euryarchaeota, these archaeal species may contain PGIs that are distantly related to eubacterial and eukaryotic PGIs (13Hansen T. Wendorff D. Schonheit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2262-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The proteins from three of these genes, from Aeropyrum pernix, Thermoplasma acidophilum, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum, have been characterized and show PGI activity (13Hansen T. Wendorff D. Schonheit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2262-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Hansen T. Urbanke K. Schonheit P. Extremophiles,. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Most interestingly, these enzymes also exhibit phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) activity and can catalyze the interconversion of mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) (the C-2 epimer of Glc-6-P) to Fru-6-P at an equal rate as Glc-6-P to Fru-6-P (13Hansen T. Wendorff D. Schonheit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2262-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Hansen T. Urbanke K. Schonheit P. Extremophiles,. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The lack of any recognizable pmi gene in these species suggests that this PMI activity may have a function in vivo. Together with homologues from Sulfolobus species, Thermoplasma volcanicum, and Aquifex aeolicus, these enzymes appear to comprise a novel PGI/PMI family within the PGI superfamily (13Hansen T. Wendorff D. Schonheit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2262-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mechanism of PMI activity in these PGI/PMIs is interesting because the specificity of “conventional” PGIs for Glc-6-P and Fru-6-P is essentially absolute (15Rose I.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 491-517PubMed Google Scholar). Although the conventional enzyme can interconvert the anomeric forms of Man-6-P (16Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. Schray K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2232-2234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it will not isomerize this substrate to Fru-6-P or epimerize it to Glc-6-P (except at extremely low and nonphysiological rates (17Seeholzer S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). PMI activity within a PGI can be explained by one of two mechanisms (17Seeholzer S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One mechanism is to use a second base catalyst in the active site and the reaction proceeds via a trans-enediol intermediate. The other mechanism is to rotate the C-2—C-3 substrate bond after proton abstraction from C-2 and prior to proton donation to C-1 (in the Glc-6-P to Fru-6-P direction), and this would presumably require a larger active site to accommodate the rotation. To determine whether these dual PGI/PMIs do belong to the PGI superfamily and to elucidate the structural basis for both enzyme activities, we have determined the structure of PGI/PMI from P. aerophilum in native form at 1.16-Å resolution and in complex with the PGI inhibitor 5-phosphoarabinonate at 1.45-Å resolution. These structures reveal an unexpectedly high degree of similarity with eubacterial and eukaryotic PGIs, but they also show a subtle difference in the active site architecture that may be responsible for the altered specificity. Structure Determination—The crystallization of PGI/PMI from P. aerophilum (PaPGI/PMI) has been described previously (18Swan M.K. Hansen T. Schönheit P. Davies C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1481-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, the crystals belong to space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 55.1 Å, b = 100.8 Å, c = 55.8 Å, and β = 113.2°, and an initial native data set extending to 1.6 Å was reported (18Swan M.K. Hansen T. Schönheit P. Davies C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1481-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The crystals were cryo-protected over a period of several hours by passage through a series of mother liquor solutions (25% polyethylene glycol 8000 (w/v) and 0.22 m ammonium sulfate, buffered with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) each containing increasing amounts of glycerol in 2% increments up to a maximum of 26%. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by exchanging this solution with an equivalent solution containing a heavy atom salt. Several such compounds were tested. The method for specific iodination of aromatic residues has been described previously (19Sigler P.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3609-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The crystals were then flash-frozen to -180 °C in situ using a cryostream (X-Stream 2000: Rigaku-MSC). Diffraction data were recorded with an RAXIS-IV++ imaging plate system (Rigaku-MSC) mounted on a Rigaku RU-H3R copper rotating anode generator, operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. The x-ray beam was conditioned with Confocal Maxflux™ optics (Osmic, Inc.). For these data sets, the crystal-to-detector distance was 120 mm, and a typical exposure time was 3 min per 1.0° oscillation image. These data were processed using CrystalClear (20Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Derivatives were identified by calculation of Patterson maps using PHASES (21Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 277: 590-620Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and phasing calculations at 2.0 Å were performed using autoSHARP (22de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 23Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) followed by solvent flattening with phase extension to 1.8 Å using SOLOMON (24Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Model Building and Refinement—The experimental phases were the starting point for automated model building using the program ARP/wARP (25Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 26Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To obtain the best data set for refinement, new native data were collected at the SER-CAT beamline ID22 at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory.). These data were acquired on a MAR225 CCD detector with exposure times of 1 s per image, a crystal-to-detector distance of 100 mm, and an oscillation angle of 0.5°. To ensure high redundancy of the data, 360° were collected. Processing was performed using the HKL2000 software package (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). After refinement of the initial model against these data using REFMAC5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13853) Google Scholar), the model was improved manually using XTALVIEW (29McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). Further refinement cycles consisted of the addition of solvent atoms using ARP/wARP, refinement with REFMAC5, and model building with XTAL-VIEW. Refinement of side chain alternative conformations and anisotropic temperature factors was included toward the end of the refinement process. The secondary structure of the final model was calculated using DSSP (30Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar). Inhibitor-bound Structure—Crystals were soaked for 5 days in mother liquor solutions containing 26% glycerol and 5 mm of the PGI inhibitor 5-phosphoarabinonate (PAB) (31Chirgwin J.M. Noltmann E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7272-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synchrotron data were collected at the SER-CAT beamline in the same way as the high resolution native data. PAB bound at the active site was visualized by refinement of the native model against the data collected from the ligand-soaked crystal, followed by examination of the|Fo| -|Fc difference electron density map. After fitting of the PAB molecule, the structure was refined by using the same protocol used for the native structure and using the same free R assignments as the native data. Structure superimpositions were performed using the CCP4 program LSQKAB (32Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2343) Google Scholar). Coordinates and structure factors for both structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under code 1TZB for native and 1TZC for complex with PAB. Structure Determination—The structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement using three derivatives, two gold and one iodine (Table I). Although three iodine peaks were visible in the Patterson map, this derivative had low phasing power and likely contributed little to the final phases. Phasing with SHARP at 1.8-Å resolution produced an experimental electron density map of excellent quality (Fig. 2a) and permitted automated model building of the entire structure except the methionines at each N terminus. After refinement against high resolution data extending to 1.16 Å, the final model has an R factor of 15.0% and Rfree of 16.4%, with excellent stereochemistry (Table II). This model comprises two subunits (of 300 and 301 residues, respectively), 625 water molecules, as well as several molecules of sulfate and glycerol from the crystallization solution. A molecule of sulfate occupies the substrate phosphate-binding site in the active site of each subunit. Only the C-terminal glutamine of subunit B is not visible in the electron density due to apparent flexibility in the vicinity of the C terminus. The N-terminal methionine appears to be absent from the protein because the amino group of Ala-2 forms an electrostatic interaction with a neighboring aspartate, and there is no room for an additional residue. The extremely high resolution of the structure also permitted the modeling of 47 side chains and some main chain regions with alternative conformations: 22 in subunit A and 25 in subunit B. The final 2(|Fo| -|Fc|) electron density map at 1.16-Å resolution is shown in Fig. 2b.Table IStatistics of the phasing using three derivatives in the multiple isomorphous method at 2.0-Å resolution followed by phase extension to 1.8 ÅDerivativeAuBr2AuKBr1Iod4Concentration of soak (mm)1081.8Length of soak24 h4 days10 daysResolution of data2.02.02.5Completeness95.199.186.5RmergeaRmerge=∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl)−〈I(hkl)〉|/∑hkl∑iIi(hkl).7.08.013.0No. reflections36,17937,12316,798RisobRiso=|FPH−FP|/∑FP|.17.118.43.7Type of dataisoanoisoanoisoanoPhasing powercPhasing power = FH/Er.m.s.

Open table in a new tab Structure Description—The structure of PaPGI/PMI is a tight dimer of essentially identical subunits; the two subunits superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.71 Å for all atoms. The structure of one subunit and the dimer are shown in Fig. 3. The subunit comprises two domains, each of which is built around a parallel β sheet, five-stranded in the N-terminal domain and four-stranded in the C-terminal domain. The N terminus is located approximately between the two domains and extends across the face of the N-terminal domain before forming a β hairpin structure (β1 and β2). Thereafter, the N-terminal domain is comprised of alternating αβ segments with α-helices connecting β strands except for the connection between β4 and β5, which is not helical. After α7, the chain crosses over to the C-terminal domain where the same pattern of alternating αβ structure occurs. The C terminus is helical (α15) and is also located between the two domains. The dimer is compact and globular in shape, with no significant extended structural features (Fig. 3b). Two short helical segments, α11 and α12, undergo domain swapping and are an integral part of the opposite subunit. At the dimer interface are numerous ionic interactions that may contribute to the thermostability of the enzyme. Comparison with Conventional PGI—Even though the sequence similarity between them is barely detectable (13Hansen T. Wendorff D. Schonheit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2262-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), PaPGI/PMI shares a common fold with conventional PGIs. The structure was superimposed with that of rabbit PGI (rPGI) (6Davies C. Muirhead H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), using an algorithm based on secondary structure matching (33, Krissinel, K., and Henrick, K. (2003) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Molecular Structural Biology (Kungl, A. J., and Kungl, P. J., eds) Vienna, September 3-7, 2003, p. 88,Google Scholar), and shows the structural elements that are common to both proteins (Fig. 4). The overall domain structure is the same, but it is immediately obvious that PaPGI/PMI is far smaller and overlaps mostly with the protein core of rabbit PGI. This superimposition permits a structure-based alignment of the PGI sequences from rabbit and P. aerophilum, which shows the relationship between the two proteins more clearly (Fig. 5). A large part of the absent structure in PaPGI/PMI corresponds to the N-terminal end of rabbit PGI, consisting of seven α helices and two β strands, which together form the outer surface of the protein from rabbit. The absence of β1 and β2 (rPGI nomenclature) leaves a parallel four-stranded β sheet in PaPGI/PMI because in rabbit PGI these two strands are anti-parallel and so create a mixed parallel/anti-parallel six-stranded sheet in that enzyme. The C terminus is also shortened; the final helix (α24 in rPGI) is absent, and prior to that, α15 is only half the length of its equivalent in rPGI, α23. The latter helix is important because in conventional PGI it moves toward the active site after ligand binding and contains a lysine (Lys-518) that is critical for catalysis (34Davies C. Muirhead H. Chirgwin J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1111-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, in rabbit PGI, the structure that forms a “hook” (α20 and α21), and extends to mediate intersubunit contacts in conventional PGIs (6Davies C. Muirhead H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), has no counterpart in PaPGI/PMI. In addition to these major differences, many of the connections are shorter in PaPGI/PMI.Fig. 5A structure-based sequence alignment of PaPGI/PMI with rPGI. The PGI sequences from P. aerophilum and rabbit are denoted P.a. and O.c. (for Oryctolagus cuniculus), respectively. The secondary structure assignments for each structure are also shown and are color ramped blue-to-red in the N- to C-terminal direction. Residues within the active site are highlighted in red, including the highly conserved residues responsible for catalysis. This figure was produced using the software SecSeq (D. Brodersen, unpublished).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Complex with 5-Phosphoarabinonate—To establish the identity of the active site of PaPGI/PMI, the structure was determined in complex with PAB, a well known inhibitor of PGI activity (31Chirgwin J.M. Noltmann E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7272-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at 1.45-Å resolution (Table II). PAB bound in an identical manner to both active sites in the dimer, and the view of molecule A is shown in Fig. 6. At one end of the active site, the phosphate group is oriented by three serines (Ser-48, Ser-87, and Ser-89) and one threonine (Thr-92). In the middle of the inhibitor, the C-4 hydroxyl (equivalent to the ring oxygen in the substrate) is within hydrogen-bonding distance of Lys-298 and His-219 (the latter residue belonging to the adjacent subunit in the dimer); the C-3 hydroxyl is contacted by the amide of Gly-47 and the C-2 hydroxyl by the carbonyl group of His-219. In PAB, a carboxylate group replaces the C-1—C-2 region of the substrate such that O-1α is equivalent to C-1 and the carbon at position 1 is equivalent to C-2 of the substrate. Glu-203 is approximately equidistant from both of these atoms, showing that this residue is best placed to abstract and donate protons to the C-1 and C-2 positions of the substrate. This structure permits a direct comparison with that of rabbit PGI in complex with the same inhibitor (35Jeffery C.J. Hardre R. Salmon L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The active sites of the two structures were superimposed by using the coordinates of PAB (Fig. 7). This shows that the majority of amino acids forming the active site are conserved between conventional PGI and PaPGI/PMIs. The cluster of threonines and serines that forms the sugar phosphate-binding site in conventional PGI (3Read J. Pearce J. Li X. Muirhead H. Chirgwin J. Davies C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) is conserved in PaPGI/PMI as Ser-48, Ser-87, and Thr-92 with just a threonine to serine change at position 89. Residues that are important for catalysis in conventional PGI are also conserved in PaPGI/PMI; Glu-357 in rPGI is represented by Glu-203 in PaPGI/PMI, His-388 by His-219, and Lys-518 by Lys-298. There are some differences, however, most notably a proline (Pro-134) in PaPGI/PMI in place of Gly-271, which lead to an alteration in the conformation of β7 to α6 loop in comparison to the same loop in rPGI, and Thr-291 in place of Gln-511. The homology evident between the two active sites confirms PaPGI/PMI as a member of the PGI superfamily (13Hansen T. Wendorff D. Schonheit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2262-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, the lack of any residue in the vicinity of the carboxylate group of PAB, other than Glu-203, that might act as a base catalyst, shows that the PMI mechanism of this enzyme is unlikely to use a trans-enediol intermediate (discussed below). Conformational Changes Upon Ligand Binding—To determine whether conformational changes occur in PaPGI/PMI in response to the binding of ligands at the active site in the same manner as PGI from eubacterial and eukaryotic sources (e.g. in rabbit PGI (6Davies C. Muirhead H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36Arsenieva D. Jeffery C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)), the native structure and its complex with PAB were superimposed. The r.m.s. deviations calculated between all main chain atoms in the structures is 0.22 Å. Examining the superimposed structures reveals almost no structural differences between the native and PAB-bound structures (Fig. 8). The exception is a slight shift in the C-terminal helix in subunit B, which is due to an improvement in the ordering of this region compared with the wild-type structure. In particular, the C-terminal residue Gln-302 is now visible and hydrogen bonds a water molecule that is close to the PAB inhibitor. Other than this, the positions of all of the residues within the active site region are essentially unchanged. Moreover, given the very close overlap of residues in rabbit PGI and PaPGI/PMI when both complexed to PAB, it is clear that the native state of PaPGI/PMI is equivalent to the ligand-bound “closed” form of rabbit PGI. A major goal of this work was to determine whether PaPGI/PMI belongs to the superfamily of PGI, as suggested by sequence similarity with some of the motifs that comprise conventional PGI (13Hansen T. Wendorff D. Schonheit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2262-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Swan M.K. Hansen T. Schönheit P. Davies C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The gene product, peripherin/rds (P/rds), is a member of the tetraspanin protein family required for normal vertebrate photoreceptor outer segment (OS) architecture. Although its molecular function remains uncertain, P/rds has been suggested to catalyze membrane fusion events required for the OS renewal process. This study investigates the importance of two charged residues within a predicted C-terminal helical region for protein biosynthesis, localization, and interaction with model membranes. Targeted mutagenesis was utilized to neutralize charges at Glu321 and Lys324 individually and in combination to generate three mutant variants. Studies were conducted on variants expressed as 1) full-length P/rds in COS-1 cells, 2) glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and 3) membrane-associated green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in transgenic Xenopus laevis. None of the mutations affected biosynthesis of full-length P/rds in COS-1 cells as assessed by Western blotting, sedimentation velocity, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Although all mutations reside within a recently identified localization signal, none altered the ability of this region to direct OS targeting in transgenic X. laevis retinas. In contrast, individual or simultaneous neutralization of the charged amino acids Glu321 and Lys324 abolished the ability of the C-terminal domain to promote model membrane fusion as assayed by lipid mixing. These results demonstrate that, although overlapping, C-terminal determinants responsible for OS targeting and fusogenicity are separable and that fusogenic activity has been uncoupled from other protein properties. The observation that subunit assembly and OS targeting can both proceed normally in the absence of fusogenic activity suggests that properly assembled and targeted yet functionally altered proteins could potentially generate pathogenic effects within the vertebrate photoreceptor.

Rod and cone vertebrate photoreceptor outer segments (OSs) 1The abbreviations used are: OS, outer segment; P/rds, peripherin/rds; EC2, extracellular/intradiskal loop 2; CHR, C-terminal helical region; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild-type; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; NBD-PE, N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine; Rh-PE, N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)phosphatidylethanolamine; LUVs, large unilamellar liposomes; diS-C3-(5), 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide; SUVs, small unilamellar vesicles. contain hundreds of neatly stacked photopigment-containing membranous disks that are essential for normal vision. A polarized renewal process replaces these membranes such that a complete turnover of OS disks in rod cells is effected approximately once every 10 days (1Young R.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1976; 15: 700-725PubMed Google Scholar). Renewal is thought necessary to counter the effects of light damage and oxidation of OS lipids, and evidence from several laboratories has shown that a coordination of new disk assembly (morphogenesis) with aged disk removal (shedding) is needed to maintain normal OS structure (2Nguyen-Legros J. Hicks D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 245-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Boesze-Battaglia K. Goldberg A.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 217: 183-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Defects in disk morphogenesis or shedding that compromise the renewal process lead to disorganization of the OS layer and eventual photoreceptor cell death. Although OS renewal has been linked to environmental factors including light, temperature, and ionic milieu, the process is not currently well understood in molecular terms, particularly with regard to regulation of the membrane fusion processes required (2Nguyen-Legros J. Hicks D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 245-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rds (retinal degeneration slow) gene product, peripherin/rds (P/rds; also known as photoreceptor peripherin, peripherin/rds, rds/peripherin, rds, and peripherin-2), appears to be a central player in OS morphogenesis and the renewal process. First described in 1978, the rds mouse possesses a large insertion of viral DNA in chromosome 17 that results in a null allele (4Van Nie R. Ivanyi D. Demant P. Tissue Antigens. 1978; 12: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Demant P. Ivanyi D. Van Nie R. Tissue Antigens. 1979; 13: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Travis G.H. Brennan M.B. Danielson P.E. Kozak C.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1989; 338: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Heterozygous and homozygous animals display irregular and absent OSs, respectively, with otherwise normal retinal morphology at young ages (7Sanyal S. Jansen H.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1981; 21: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Hawkins R.K. Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 41: 701-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Photoreceptor cell bodies subsequently die by apoptosis, and deterioration of the photoreceptor cell layer in homozygotes is essentially complete by 12 months of age (9Sanyal S. De Ruiter A. Hawkins R.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1980; 194: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10Chang G.Q. Hao Y. Wong F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Although clearly required for OS formation, the P/rds mechanism of action at the molecular level is less obvious. Studies from several laboratories concur that it is an integral membrane protein localized to the rim regions of photoreceptor disks in normal retina (11Arikawa K. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. Williams D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 12Kedzierski W. Moghrabi W.N. Allen A.C. Jablonski-Stiemke M.M. Azarian S.M. Bok D. Travis G.H. J.

Present in all vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptors examined to date, this protein causes a variety of progressive retinal diseases in humans when defective (13Kohl S. Giddings I. Besch D.

Proposals for function include disk rim formation, disk flattening, disk stack scaffolding, disk-plasma membrane interaction, and/or catalysis of disk renewal (14Travis G.H. Sutcliffe J.G. Bok D.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence to favor one clearly defined mode of action at the molecular level is still lacking. In some species, P/rds action can be modulated by the presence of the homologous rom-1 polypeptide; however, the molecular function of rom-1 is also unclear (21Clarke G. Goldberg A.F.X. Vidgen D. Collins L. Ploder L. Schwarz L. Molday L.L. Rossant J. Szel A. Molday R.S. Birch D.G. McInnes R.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A recent report describing the presence of a localization signal in the C terminus of P/rds (but not rom-1) suggests a rationale for why rom-1 knockout mice can elaborate photoreceptor OSs, but P/rds null mice cannot (20Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Papermaster D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have previously used targeted mutagenesis to investigate P/rds structure-function relationships and to show that folding and tetrameric subunit assembly are guided by discrete determinants within the extracellular/intradiskal loop 2 (EC2) domain (22Goldberg A.F.X. Fales L.M. Hurley J.B. Khattree N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (A. F. X.): 42700-42706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The vast majority of the predicted extramembranous polypeptide sequence, including a 66-amino acid C-terminal domain, makes no measurable contribution to protein biosynthesis. In contrast, several biophysical studies suggest that the P/rds C terminus functions to catalyze membrane-membrane fusion events (17Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli Jr., A.A. Sinha S. Guo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Boesze-Battaglia K. Kong F. Lamba O.P. Stefano F.P. Williams D.S.

Acta. 2000; 1463: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Boesze-Battaglia K. Goldberg A.F. Dispoto J. Katragadda M. Cesarone G. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Those studies indicate that the C terminus contains an amphipathic helix that functions as a fusion peptide, and a recent investigation found that truncating the protein within the helix greatly diminishes fusogenic activity (25Boesze-Battaglia K. Goldberg A.F. Dispoto J. Katragadda M. Cesarone G. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fusion peptides are short amphiphilic helical regions essential for the activity of known membrane fusion proteins (26White J.M. Science. 1992; 258: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 27Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Their amphiphilic character is thought to promote membrane destabilization via insertion into and disruption of bilayer structures; however, mechanisms of fusion peptide action are still being widely debated and studied (27Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Likewise, amphiphilicity appears to be important for the proposed P/rds fusion peptide; the membrane destabilization activity of a P/rds synthetic peptide model was strongly inhibited when its amphiphilicity was reduced by decreasing hydrophobicity (24Boesze-Battaglia K. Stefano F.P. Fenner M. Napoli Jr., A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1463: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that rom-1, a peripherin/rds homolog, lacks strong amphiphilicity in this region and is unable to promote membrane fusion in vitro (28Boesze-Battaglia K. Gretzula C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4259Google Scholar). In particular, rom-1 possesses non-polar substitutions at two positions relative to the conserved P/rds fusion peptide sequence that result in a loss of two charged residues (Glu321 and Lys324) and a decrease in predicted hydrophobic moment. The significance of charged residues in the P/rds fusion peptide has not been examined to date, although ionizable amino acids are reported to play an important role in several other fusion peptides (27Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 29Korte T. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Blumenthal R. Virology. 2001; 289: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An improved understanding of P/rds C-terminal structure-function relationships is required to relate fusogenic activity measured in vitro to its proposed molecular function in the photoreceptor OS. This is an inherently difficult undertaking, as there are no facile approaches to assay the membrane fusion events involved in the vertebrate photoreceptor renewal process. This task is complicated by the recent identification of a C-terminal OS localization signal that overlaps the previously identified fusion peptide (20Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Papermaster D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This study examines the significance of two conserved charged residues, Glu321 and Lys324, to further our understanding of how the C-terminal domain contributes to P/rds function. We find that these residues are essential for P/rds fusogenic activity, but not biosynthesis, subunit assembly, or OS localization. The uncoupling of fusogenic activity from other properties suggests that properly assembled and targeted yet functionally altered proteins could generate pathogenic effects in the vertebrate photoreceptor. Engineering C-terminal Helical Region (CHR) Mutants for Expression in COS-1 Cells, Escherichia coli, and Xenopus laevis—Three sets of constructs were used in this study (see Fig. 1C). The first set encodes full-length (346 predicted amino acids) bovine P/rds for expression in COS-1 cells and was used for the assay of protein biosynthesis and subunit assembly. The second set of constructs, encoding only the 66-amino acid P/rds C-terminal domain fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), was used to express and purify proteins from E. coli and was used for assay of membrane interactions. Lack of cell-surface expression in COS-1 cells precluded the routine use of full-length mutants for membrane interaction studies. The third set of constructs, encoding the 66-amino acid P/rds C-terminal domain fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), was utilized to drive protein expression in transgenic X. laevis for the assay of subcellular localization. Each set of constructs includes wild-type (WT) P/rds and three variants, two single missense mutations (E321L and K324A) and the combined double missense mutation (E321L,K324A). The bacterial expression plasmids were based upon pGST-CTER, an inducible expression vector encoding GST followed by the 66-amino acid hydrophilic C terminus of WT bovine P/rds (25Boesze-Battaglia K. Goldberg A.F. Dispoto J. Katragadda M. Cesarone G. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nucleotide base changes were designed to introduce point mutations into the previously identified fusion peptide region Val312-Leu326 (17Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli Jr., A.A. Sinha S.

Acta. 2000; 1463: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In each instance, a charged residue conserved across P/rds orthologs was replaced by an uncharged residue from the homologous region of the aligned bovine rom-1 sequence (see Fig. 1B). Single and double mutants were constructed serially using synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Table I) and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenized regions were verified by DNA sequencing using a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Mutagenized regions (as BamHI fragments) were returned to non-mutagenized expression vector backgrounds by subcloning to generate bacterial expression plasmids pGST-E321L, pGST-K324A, and pGSTE321L,K324A. Correct assembly of the plasmids was confirmed by restriction mapping.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides used for targeted mutagenesisVariantOligonucleotidespGST-E321L5′-CCTTTCTGCTGAGTGTGAAGAAGCTGGGCA-3′ (forward)5′-TGCCCAGCTTCTTCACACTCAGCAGAAAGG-3′ (reverse)pGST-K324A5′-GGCCTTTCTGGAGAGTGTGGCGAAGCTGG-3′ (forward)5′-CCAGCTTCGCCACACTCTCCAGAAAGGCC-3′ (reverse)pGST-E321L,K324A5′-CTGAGTGTGGCGAAGCTGGGCAAGGGCAAC-3′ (forward)5′-GTTGCCCTTGCCCAGCTTCGCCACACTCAG-3′ (reverse) Open table in a new tab The mammalian expression plasmids were based upon the bacterial expression series described above and a cDNA clone encoding the full-length WT P/rds sequence (30Connell G.J.

The mutagenized CHRs were then excised as SacII/XhoI fragments and ligated into SacII/XhoI-digested pcPERS, the non-mutagenized expression vector background containing the full-length protein coding region of bovine P/rds (22Goldberg A.F.X.

Completed constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping. The constructs designed for expression of mutant variants in transgenic X. laevis were based on the plasmid pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The cytomegalovirus promoter was replaced with a 0.8-kb fragment of the proximal X. laevis opsin promoter (pXOP-0.8). Following the GFP cDNA, a sequence encoding the C terminus of X. laevis rhodopsin lacking the terminal five amino acids (i.e. amino acids 311-348) was inserted to create pXOP-0.8-EGFP-rhoCT. This plasmid was designed to accept the BamHI fragments encoding the 66 amino acids of bovine P/rds (described above) in-frame behind the GFP-rhodopsin sequence. The presence of a palmitoylation signal within the rhodopsin sequence creates a membrane-bound GFP reporter molecule (20Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Papermaster D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The desired constructs were selected and verified by restriction mapping. The previously described constructs GFP-rhoCT44 and GFP-rhoCT44del5 were also used as controls (33Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Hurd L.B. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Assay of Expression and Disulfide Bonding in COS-1 Cells—P/rds-containing membranes were prepared at 4 °C from transiently transfected COS-1 cells as follows. Adherent cells grown on 100-mm plastic culture dishes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline 48 h post-transfection. Cells were scraped from plates with a rubber policeman and collected into 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 2.5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml Pefabloc-SC (Roche Applied Science). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1.2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2.5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml Pefabloc-SC. The resuspended cells were passed forcefully through 26-gauge syringe needles five times, and the resulting lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Supernatants were transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellets were resuspended by vortexing and trituration in 115-μl aliquots of Tris-buffered saline containing 2.5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml Pefabloc-SC. COS-1 cell membranes prepared in this fashion were stored at -70 °C until used. Western blot analysis of WT and mutant P/rds expression and disulfide bonding in transfected COS-1 membranes was performed using anti-P/rds monoclonal antibody (mAb) C6 and methods described previously (22Goldberg A.F.X. Fales L.M. Hurley J.B. Khattree N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (A. F. X.): 42700-42706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thawed COS-1 cell membranes (3 μl/lane) were solubilized with denaturing sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and samples were heated in boiling water for 5 min prior to loading onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Analysis of disulfide bonding was performed in an analogous manner in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. Immunofluorescent Localization in COS-1 Cells—WT and mutant P/rds were localized in transiently transfected COS-1 cells as described previously (22Goldberg A.F.X. Fales L.M. Hurley J.B. Khattree N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (A. F. X.): 42700-42706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 and then processed using anti-P/rds mAb C6 and a secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody covalently labeled with the Cy3 fluorophore (Amersham Biosciences). A similar procedure used a 1:200 dilution of a mouse anti-KDEL receptor monoclonal antibody (Stressgen Biotech Corp.) in conjunction with a secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody covalently labeled with the Cy2 fluorophore (Amersham Biosciences) to label cis-Golgi and intermediate Golgi membranes. Likewise, a 1:200 dilution of a rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (Stressgen Biotech Corp.) was used in conjunction with a secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody covalently labeled with the Cy2 fluorophore to label the endoplasmic reticulum. A Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped with an epifluorescent illuminator and a SPOT RT digital imaging system (Version 3.0 software, Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) were utilized for image acquisition. Image processing was limited to adjustment of brightness and contrast. Assay of Subunit Assembly by Velocity Sedimentation—A previously established procedure was used to measure the sedimentation velocities of detergent-solubilized WT and mutant P/rds; a Beckman Optima TLX centrifuge and TLS-55 rotor were utilized as described previously (34Goldberg A.F.X. Molday R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 671-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, Triton X-100 extracts of transiently transfected COS-1 cells were layered onto 2-ml 5-20% sucrose gradients and centrifuged overnight at 4 °C. Soluble fractions were collected by off-center puncture of tube bottoms; particulate fractions were collected by solubilization of pellets with Laemmli sample buffer. Scion Image software was utilized for image analysis of chemiluminescent Western blots; pixel summation over soluble and particulate fractions was used to calculate total P/rds reactivity (22Goldberg A.F.X. Fales L.M. Hurley J.B. Khattree N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (A. F. X.): 42700-42706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Peak immunoreactivities were taken for the calculation of s20,w values. Mutant Expression and Subcellular Localization in Transgenic X. laevis Retina—Transgenic tadpoles were generated using a modified protocol (36Moritz O.L. Tam B.M. Knox B.E. Papermaster D.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3276-3280PubMed Google Scholar) based on that of Kroll and Amaya (35Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WT X. laevis adults were obtained from Xenopus I (Dexter, MI). X. laevis sperm nuclei were incubated with 0.3× high speed egg extract, 0.05 units of NotI restriction enzyme, and 100-200 ng of NotI-linearized vector DNA in a total volume of 18 μl. After 10 min, the reaction mixture was diluted to 0.3 nuclei/nl, and 10 nl was injected per egg. The resulting embryos were reared in 0.1× Marc's modified Ringer's solution containing 6% Ficoll and 50 μg/ml gentamycin for 48 h and then transferred to 0.1× Gerhart's modified Ringer's solution (37Wu M. Gerhart J. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Animals were treated with 18 μg/ml G418 for 96 h as previously described to select for transgenic animals and to reduce the extent of gene silencing (38Moritz O.L. Peck A. Tam B.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 298: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). At 5-6 days post-fertilization, roughly corresponding to stages 40-42, tadpoles were screened for GFP expression using a Zeiss Axioskop equipped with epifluorescence optics and a GFP filter set (39Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus Laevis (Daudin): A Systematical and Chronological Survey of the Development from the Fertilized Egg Till the End of Metamorphosis. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Tadpoles expressing GFP were identified by green fluorescence emitted from their eyes. All animals were raised at 18 °C on a 12/12 light cycle (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.). Stage 48-62 transgenic tadpoles were killed between 4 and 7 p.m. (i.e. near the end of the light cycle) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). Fixed eyes were embedded in OCT tissue embedding medium (Tissue-Tek) and cryosectioned. Frozen sections (14 μm) were stained with Texas Red-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) to label Golgi/post-Golgi membranes and nuclei, respectively, as previously described (20Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Papermaster D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Labeled sections were mounted in 50% glycerol. A Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a C-Apochromat (40× W Korr, 1.2-numerical aperture objective) and Zeiss LSM software were used to acquire images of labeled sections. At least three transgenic animals were examined by confocal microscopy for each construct. Expression and Purification of GST-C-terminal Domain Fusion Proteins—A standardized expression and purification procedure based on methods developed for pGST-CTER was used. Thirty ml of a plasmid-transformed, freshly saturated E. coli XL1-Blue culture was used to inoculate 900 ml of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown with agitation at 37 °C for 1.5 h, and fusion protein expression was induced for an additional 3 h (with agitation at 37 °C) by the introduction of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at -70 °C until used. The frozen cell pellet was thawed on ice and resuspended by vortexing in 35 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The lysate was stirred for 20 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was applied to a 6-ml column of packed glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and the column was washed with 10 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. The GST-C-terminal domain fusion protein was eluted by three sequential single bed volume equilibrations of 5 min each using 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing 10 mm reduced glutathione and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Combined eluates were concentrated with a stirred ultrafiltration cell; dialyzed at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol; and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Protein determinations were carried out with a BCA assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin to construct the standard curve. Assay of Vesicle Fusion by Lipid Mixing—An established procedure was adapted to measure lipid mixing using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (40Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the dilution of a resonance energy transfer pair, N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) and N-(lissamine"

In vitro, binding occurs to multiple sites within the Pipe polypeptide and shows specificity for two consecutive aromatic residues. A second site in Wind, formed by a cluster of residues within the D-domain, is likewise required for substrate processing.

These functions are essential for maintaining a productive folding environment for many secretory proteins within the ER (1Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 2Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that may be critical for viability of the organism (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Hoshijima K. Metherall J.E. Grunwald D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2518-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The chaperone function of these proteins, and probably to varying extents redox activity as well, relies on their ability to interact non-covalently with specific peptide sequences or epitopes in substrate proteins (2Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, until recently no concise data on peptide specificity, peptide binding sites, or the molecular basis for the observed substrate selectivity of these proteins were available. Data on such inherently weak interactions would require detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the protein concerned. Although independent NMR structures of the isolated a- and b-type thioredoxin fold domains (redox-active and redox-inactive domains, respectively) of PDI have been reported (5Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 6Kemmink J. Dijkstra K. Mariani M. Scheek R.M. Penka E. Nilges M. Darby N.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), no complete structure of a eukaryotic PDI protein was available. Most PDI proteins are redox-active, and the involvement of relatively strong heteromeric disulfide bond formation and reduction in assays aimed at elucidating the nature of weak chaperone interactions poses further problems. Because the b′-domain has been identified as the major substrate binding site in PDI (7Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), much attention has been focused on these redox-inactive domains. However, the lack of suitable substrates of physiological relevance with a maturation process that can be readily monitored has complicated these studies. Thus much could be learned from the study of peptide binding and chaperone activity of a naturally occurring PDI family protein lacking redox properties but having a clearly defined substrate that can be studied both in vivo and in vitro. We recently described the first crystal structure of a complete PDI-related protein of the eukaryotic ER (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This protein, Wind, is essential in Drosophila melanogaster for dorsal-ventral patterning within the developing embryo, and it is required for ER export of an essential Golgi transmembrane proteoglycan modifying enzyme, Pipe (a 2-O-sulfotransferase) (8Sen J. Goltz J.S. Konsolaki M. Schupbach T. Stein D. Development. 2000; 127: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from a b-domain, Wind also has a unique C-terminal domain found only in the PDI-D subclass of PDI-related proteins (1Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The function of the D-domain is poorly understood, although in Dictyostelium discoideum PDI-D it was shown to play a role in ER retention (9Monnat J. Neuhaus E.M. Pop M.S. Ferrari D.M. Kramer B. Soldati T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3469-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the Pipe-processing activity requires both the b- and D-domains of Wind. Although the mammalian Wind orthologue ERp28/29 cannot replace Wind in Pipe processing, the D-domains of both proteins could be exchanged, indicating functional conservation between the proteins (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Wind binds Pipe directly in vitro, and we map a putative peptide binding site within the Wind b-domain. We further describe a surface of the D-domain, the integrity of which is also required for Pipe processing. This work, based on the Wind crystal structure, represents the most accurate map of a peptide binding site within a PDI-related protein available to date and provides for the first time direct evidence for specific interaction with target sequences within natural substrates. The data presented suggest a solution to the apparent abundance and redundancy of PDI-related proteins within the ER lumen, indicating that discrete surface residues within and around a shallow pocket in the immediate vicinity of the CGHC redox-active motif of the a-domains or the corresponding residues of the b-domains determine substrate specificity for simple recognition motifs present in secretory proteins. Cell Lines, Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Expression Vectors—Mammalian COS-7 and Vero cell lines were purchased from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures; XL1-Blue bacterial cells and the plasmid pBlueScript II were from Stratagene; pEGFP-N1 expression vector was from Clontech; and pQE-30 and pQE-60 expression vectors were from and Qiagen. Antibodies—Antibodies against full-length Drosophila Wind were raised as described previously (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Bacterial Expression Vector Constructs—Drosophila windbeutel full-length cDNA and Pipe cDNA were amplified and cloned as described (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). BamHI/SacI and NcoI/BglII PCR products encoding mature Wind were ligated into pQE-30 and pQE-60, respectively, generating constructs that have N-terminal (His-Wind) or C-terminal (Wind-His) His6 tag extensions. The Wind mutant Wind-His Y55K and a construct encoding an N-terminally His6-tagged D-domain (Wind-D, Ile150-Leu257) were made by standard mutagenesis techniques. The sequence for the soluble, luminal domain of Pipe (Tyr40-Asn403) was ligated in frame via appended BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites 3′ to glutathione S-transferase within the vector pGEX-6P2 (Amersham Biosciences). This encoded a 69-kDa fusion protein (GST-Pipe) with an N-terminal GST moiety. Mammalian Expression Vector Constructs—Full-length windbeutel was incorporated into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1, such that a stop codon preceded the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sequence, ensuring translation of WT Wind alone (this construct is Wind*-EGFP-N1). Wind point mutants (Wind T23K, C24S, T25K, V28D,Y, C27S, D29N, D31N, E32K, R41S, D50A, D50N, D50S, I51S, I51R, A52S, Y53F, Y53S, Y55F, Y55K, Y55S, G56H, E57K, K58S, H59Y, E60A, E60Q, E60Y, T63K, K84D, K84N, K84S, D85N, Y86F, Y86L, Y86Q, Y86S, G87S, E88K, E88Q, E90R, D96N, D101N, D102N, K103S, P106D, D126N, C149S, R215A, R218D, L219S, and L232K), double (V28D/R41S, D31N/R41S, E90R/D29N, E90R/E60A, and L219S/E212Q), and triple (Y55K/D31N/R41S) mutants were constructed using appropriate primers and standard site-directed mutagenesis protocols, using Wind*-EGFP-N1 as template. Wind Y55K and D31N were described previously (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Wind constructs with N-terminal extensions of 2 (GS, Wind+2), 4 (HHGS, +4), or 14 (ERMRGSHHHHHHGS, Wind+14) residues were created by insertion of a BamHI/AgeI fragment from the His-Wind construct into pEGFP-N1, followed by insertion via XhoI/BamHI sites of either of the three additional tags 3′ to the Wind signal sequence. A Wind construct (ss-D*) encoding the signal sequence appended to the Wind linker and D-domain (Ala138-Leu257) was created by insertion of a PCR fragment into the SacII/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1, followed by insertion into XhoI/SacII sites of a synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the Wind signal sequence. Wind-N and Wind-N-KEEL, encoding the b-domain alone with or without an appended retrieval sequence respectively, were constructed as described (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pipe-GFP was constructed by ligating a KpnI/BamHI fragment of cloned Pipe into pEGFP-N1, generating full-length Pipe protein fused to the N terminus of EGFP. Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence Assays—COS-7 and Vero cells were grown in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, with 2 mml-glutamine and antibiotics, at 37 °C and 10% CO2. For immunofluorescence labeling, cells transfected by electroporation were grown on coverslips overnight (17-20 h) then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Bound Wind antibody, used at a 1:150 dilution, was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody. Visualization of Cy3 and GFP was carried out on an Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss) with excitation filters of 565/30 and 480/40 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 595 and 505 nm, and emission filters of 645/75 and 527/30 nm, respectively. Vero cells stably expressing WT Wind were created by selection of Wind*-EGFP-N1-transfected cells with 0.8 mg/ml G418 for 6 weeks. Isolated colonies were thereafter maintained in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418. MG132 proteasome inhibitor (Sigma) was applied to cells 12 h after transfection at 10 μm for 4 h. Protein Expression and Purification—All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue by induction of A600 = 0.7 cultures for 3 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Recombinant Wind proteins were harvested by sonication of lysozyme-treated cells in pH 8.0-adjusted phosphate-buffered saline, including 0.2 mm Pefabloc SC protease inhibitor, followed by addition of Triton X-100 to 0.1% (v/v) and application on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid nickel affinity column (Qiagen). Bound protein was washed and eluted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Eluted protein was dialyzed against dialysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), concentrated to 8-20 mg/ml, and stored at 4 °C. Protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and was consistently >95% for all proteins. GST-tagged Pipe (GST-Pipe) was harvested by sonication of lysozyme-treated cells as above, followed by addition of 0.5 vol. of 60 mm EDTA, 6% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.5 m NaCl. After 30-min incubation at 4 °C, pellets were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, washed with 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 20 mm EDTA, and collected again by centrifugation. Inclusion bodies were denatured with IB buffer (8 m urea, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.35, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 25 °C. The cleared 10,000 × g supernatant thereof was applied onto a (1 × 15 cm) Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer IB. The pH of the flow through was set to 6.1 after dilution with 1 vol. of buffer B (8 m urea, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.1), applied onto a (1 × 3 cm) CM-Sepharose column, eluted with NaCl (0-0.5 m NaCl in buffer B), and stored at -20 °C. In Vitro Cross-linking of Microsomal Protein—After overexpression of Pipe-GFP in COS-7 cells, crude microsomal preparations were made by disrupting PBS-washed cells by passage for 10 times each through 21-, 24-, and 27-gauge needles in KHM buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate). After addition of protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche Applied Science), disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was added to 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 2 mm in Me2SO. Controls were treated with similar amounts of Me2SO alone. Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and reactions were stopped by addition of 20 mm glycine on ice for 15 min. Samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by immune blotting. Direct Interaction of Wind with Pipe Protein—Recombinant GST-Pipe from inclusion bodies was spotted directly onto nitrocellulose membranes in increasing amounts, but in constant volumes. The membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% non-fat milk powder in PBS then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 5.6 μm Wind-His, 5.6 μm His-Wind, 1.7 μm Wind-His Y55K, or 5.6 μm Wind-D in 0.5% milk/PBS solution. After 1-h incubation each with Wind antibody and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody, with three intervening washes of 5 min each with 0.5% milk/PBS solution, the membranes were washed five times for 10 min with PBS/0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and detected by chemiluminescence using the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Similar amounts of denatured BSA were used as control, and spots of Wind-His were added for calibration. Direct Interaction of Wind with Pipe Peptides—To verify the nature of interacting peptides, 177 13-mers of Pipe, covalently bound to cellulose sheets (Jerini Peptide Technologies), were scanned. These peptides cover the luminal portion of Pipe, each consecutive peptide shifted by two residues toward the C terminus. The membrane was treated with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, then incubated in 0.5% milk/PBS with either 5.6 μm Wind-His or 1.7 μm Wind-His Y55K, for 12 h at 4 °C. The sheet was washed three times for 5 min with 0.5% milk/PBS, then for 50 min with primary and secondary antibody as above. Bound protein was detected by chemiluminescence after five washes of 5 min each with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20/PBS. The membrane was stripped according to the manufacturer's recommendations after detection of the Wind-His overlay, which preceded overlay with Y55K. Direct Binding of Wind to Pipe—We have previously described a Wind mutant, Y55K, that cannot support ER export of Pipe (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Further work 2K. Barnewitz, C. Guo, M. Sevvana, Q. Ma, G. M. Sheldrick, H.-D. Söling, and D. M. Ferrari, unpublished observations. indicated that this mutant might have an increased affinity for Pipe substrate in vivo. In an attempt to visualize a direct interaction between Wind and Pipe, we overlaid membrane-bound spots of recombinant Pipe soluble domain (GST-Pipe) with recombinant C- or N-terminally His6-tagged Wind (Wind-His or His-Wind, respectively), or the Wind-His Y55K mutant (Fig. 1A). The ensuing detection by chemiluminescence clearly shows an interaction of Wind and Pipe, detectable at amounts of Pipe as low as 10 pmol. Interestingly, the strength of interaction with Pipe was of the order Wind-His Y55K > His-Wind > Wind-His. This finding is consistent with independent experiments indicating that the Y55K mutant displays a dominant negative phenotype in vivo (see below). The fact that the N-terminally His6-tagged Wind construct binds denatured substrate further indicates that peptide binding does not require surfaces within the dimer cleft, consistent with our further experimentation (see below). In contrast, no binding under these conditions was found for blots overlaid with the D-domain of Wind (data not shown), indicating that the D-domain either cannot bind substrate in the absence of the b-domain or that the target epitope is non-linear or offers binding kinetics too transient for visualization by the techniques employed here. To narrow down the search further for candidate peptide sequence(s) in Pipe responsible for the interaction with Wind, cellulose-immobilized 13-mers of Pipe were scanned with Wind or Wind Y55K. Similar approaches have been used for investigating peptide binding to chaperones such as DnaK and Hsc66 (10Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 11Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Here, the detection pattern of protein-bound spots for both applied proteins was similar, although the Y55K mutant bound much stronger and also detected more spots (Fig. 1B). Several non-overlapping sets of peptides were detected (Fig. 1B and Table I) indicating that multiple Wind binding sites may exist in Pipe. Analysis of these sequences shows great variation in sequence and character, with the notable exception of a core of two consecutive, preferentially Phe or Tyr aromatic residues, although the Y55K mutant allows other hydrophobic residues as well (Table I). Importantly, all five peptide sequences that bind Wind are also recognized by, and bind with higher affinity to, the Y55K mutant. Of these sequences, the four that bind strongest to the Y55K mutant all contain the diaromatic motif, consisting of Phe or Tyr residues, with the fifth sequence possibly with the recognition motif YXY (where X is Gln) or YL. Barring potential pitfalls such as accessibility and peptide conformation, a tentative ranking of these residues in terms of their binding affinity to the Y55K mutant gives the order: FY > FF > YF > YXY (or YL).Table IWind Y55K binding peptides in order of binding affinity Open table in a new tab The Thioredoxin Domain Has a Distinct Peptide Binding Site Close to the Dimer Cleft—We have previously shown that the b-domain of Wind contains a patch around Tyr55 that is required for Pipe processing (3Ma Q.

To define the residues involved in greater detail, we employed site-directed mutagenesis techniques to exchange 30 surface-exposed residues within 20 Å of Tyr55. These mutants were then tested for their ability to process Pipe, evaluated by the translocation of Pipe from the ER to the Golgi. Of these mutants, six (D50A, Y53S, E60Q, Y86Q, K84D, and P106D) were found in addition to the one reported previously (Y55K) (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that completely abrogated Pipe processing (Fig. 2). Of the residues concerned, all but Lys84 are conserved in mammalian Wind orthologues. Excluding Glu60 (see below), the Cα atoms of these residues define a roughly elliptical area of ∼180 Å2 with no residue, apart from Pro106, more than 10 Å distant from the center, that may constitute all or part of the substrate binding site of Wind (see Fig. 10 below). The three tyrosines, Tyr53, Tyr55, and Tyr86 form a loose cluster with the inner Tyr53 and Tyr55 at the position of Trp52 and Cys56 of the WCGHC motif of the PDI a-domain and the outer Tyr86 within the unique, inserted loop between β3 and α3 (hereafter termed the PDI-Dβ loop), more distal to the dimer interface. Asp50 Is Located in a Pocket Near Tyr53 and Is Essential for Pipe Processing—We initially found that mutation of Asp50, a conserved residue in all PDI-Dβ proteins, to Asn (D50N, data not shown) completely abrogated Pipe processing. Replacement of Asp50 with Ser allowed some retention of function, resulting in partial Golgi localization of Pipe (Fig. 2, panels c1-c3) in some cells, whereas replacement with Ala led to complete loss of activity (Fig. 2, panels b1-b3) similar to D50N. Protein expression, localization, and dimerization of D50A and D50S seem normal in our assays (Fig. 2, panels b1-b3 and c1-c3, and Fig. 3, panel d). Asp50 is located at the bottom of a shallow pocket flanked to one side by hydrophobic atoms and Tyr55, with the conserved Pro106 to the other side (see Fig. 10). Pro106 is a conserved cis-proline found also in the a-domain of PDI, but it is absent from the b-domains. It has been suggested that this proline may form part of a hydrophobic substrate binding site in other thioredoxin-related proteins (12Nordstrand K. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Most Wind Mutants Display Normal Expression and Dimerization Levels, Indicating Normal Folding in the ER—We can exclude the possibility that the D50A and tyrosine mutations have significantly destabilized the Wind dimer or prevented dimerization as cross-linking of microsomal proteins in vitro clearly showed the presence of the wind dimer at a roughly unaltered ratio to monomer (Fig. 3), and they do not display obvious aggregation in contrast to Wind V28D (see below). For Pro106, the situation is more complex. We have indicated earlier that the structure of the b-domain of Wind is intermediary between that of the a- and b-domains of PDI (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar to the corresponding proline in the PDI a-domain, the partially exposed Pro106 assumes a cis conformation in the Wind b-domain. However, the corresponding proline in the rat orthologue ERp29 was shown to be in trans conformation (13Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure. 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the PDI b-domain, the corresponding residue is Asp201 (trans). The thioredoxin fold nevertheless does not show large structural variation around this residue. Thus our P106D mutation need not necessarily disrupt the thioredoxin fold significantly. Indeed, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, expression levels, localization, and the dimer to monomer ratio appear normal for this mutant, despite some aggregation, although more rigorous approaches would be necessary to prove this point. Additionally, we have already shown that recombinant Y55K has normal chromatographic behavior when compared with WT (3Ma Q. Guo C. Barnewitz K. Sheldrick G.M. Söling H.-D. Usón I. Ferrari D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44600-44607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that the crystal structure of the Y53S mutant shows no significant structural changes compared with that of the His-Wind protein 2K. Barnewitz, C. Guo, M. Sevvana, Q. Ma, G. M. Sheldrick, H.-D. Söling, and D. M. Ferrari, unpublished observations. (Fig. 4). The PDI-Dβ Loop Plays No Essential Role in the Processing of Pipe—Lys84 is in the partially conserved PDI-Dβ loop (84KDYGEL89) between strand β3 and helix α3 (see Fig. 4). This loop does not originate from the thioredoxin domain, but the β3/α3 turn is also exploited in other thioredoxin-related proteins for non-related inserts of varying size and structure (14Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C. Martin J.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Epp O. Ladenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In these proteins it has been suggested that the insertion may play a role in substrate binding (14Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C. Martin J.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In Wind, the PDI-Dβ loop is <6 Å from Tyr53 and ∼10 Å from Tyr55. Initially, we found that exchange of Lys84 with Asp (K84D) or Tyr86 with Glu or Leu (Y86Q and Y86L), respectively, resulted in a complete loss of Pipe-processing activity (Fig. 2). However, further replacements (K84S, K84N, Y86S, and Y86F) had no significant effect on Pipe processing. The likely effect of both the K84D and Y86Q phenotypes was therefore more probably due to another, indirect effect. Furthermore, we could replace other residues in the loop (D85N, G87S, or E88K) with no effect on Pipe export (data not shown). Thus we conclude that, for Pipe processing, no essential interaction is required with specific residues within the PDI-Dβ loop. It Is Primarily the Aromatic/Hydrophobic Nature of the Tyrosine Cluster That Is Essential, Not the Polar Character—To investigate the nature of the requirement of the tyrosine cluster residues, we created mutants with one of the three tyrosines replaced with phenylalanines. None of these mutants had any negative effect on Pipe processing, whereas other single mutants at these sites (Y53S, Y55K, Y55S, Y86Q, and Y86L) completely abrogated the processing of Pipe in most cells (Fig. 2). Interestingly, however, although both Y53S and Y55S are functionally inactive, the Y86S mutant retains processing activity. This indicates that the inner Tyr53/55 pair within the cluster provides an aromatic/hydrophobic surface essential for Pipe processing, whereas the role of the outer Tyr86 in the PDI-Dβ loop seems dispensable for this substrate. Mutations in the Tyrosine Cluster Enhance Substrate Binding but Reduce Processing Efficiency of Pipe—Interestingly, we noticed that co-expression of either Wind Y53S, Y55K, K84D, or Y86Q and Pipe in COS cells caused a concomitant decrease in levels of both the Wind mutant and Pipe, which was not observed when the WT protein was used. In the case of Y53S and K84D, protein levels rose again to near-normal in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5). We therefore wished to know whether the mutations led to concomitant co-degradation of both species either due to reduced dissociation or malfolding of the associated proteins. For this purpose, we constructed a stable Vero cell line expressing wild-type Wind by selection for G418-resistance of cells transfected with the Wind*-EGFP-N1 construct. Transfection of these cells with Pipe-GFP led to accumulation of the protein in the Golgi, as expected (Fig. 6). However, when the cells were co-transfected with Pipe and either Wind Y53S, Y55K, or Y86Q, Pipe failed to leave the ER in a ma"
https://openalex.org/W2007891645,"Dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) are members of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase superfamily that dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues in vitro. Many DSPs have been found to play important roles in various aspects of cellular function and to be involved in human disease. We have identified a gene located on human chromosome 10q22.2, which utilizes alternative open reading frames (ORFs) to encode the following two distinct DSPs: the previously described testis and skeletal muscle-specific dual specificity phosphatase (TMDP) and a novel DSP, muscle-restricted dual specificity phosphatase (MDSP). Use of alternative ORFs encoding distinct proteins from a single gene is extremely rare in eukaryotes, and in all previously reported cases the two proteins produced from one gene are unrelated. To our knowledge this is the first example of a gene from which two distinct proteins of the same family are expressed using alternative ORFs. Here we provide evidence that both MDSP and TMDP proteins are expressed in vivo and are restricted to specific tissues, skeletal muscle and testis, respectively. Most interestingly, the protein expression profiles of both MDSP and TMDP during mouse postnatal development are strikingly similar. MDSP is expressed at very low levels in myotubes and early postnatal muscle. TMDP is not detectable in testis lysate in the first 3 weeks of life. The expression of both MDSP and TMDP proteins was markedly increased at approximately the 3rd week after birth and continued to increase gradually into adulthood, implying that the physiological functions of both DSPs are specific to the mature/late-developing organs.

With the completion of the genome sequencing projects, we are now aware of ∼100 PTP genes in the mammalian genomes. The PTP superfamily is roughly divided into two categories according to substrate specificity, the tyrosine-specific phosphatases and the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs). The DSPs are operationally defined as members of the PTP superfamily that have the capability to dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues in vitro. Nevertheless, in terms of physiological function, the “DSPs” may actually show preference for either Ser/Thr (1Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R.

The prototypic DSP is VH1, a virulence factor of the vaccinia virus (10Liu K. Lemon B. Traktman P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7823-7834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mossman K. Ostergaard H. Upton C.

Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Now it is known that the DSPs are a heterogeneous group that includes the VH1-like enzymes, the Cdc25-related phosphatases, and the myotubularin-related phosphatases (MTMs). Cdc25s are important regulators of cell cycle progression (reviewed in Refs. 13Eckstein J.W. Invest. New Drugs. 2000; 18: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 14Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and the MTMs are phosphoinositide phosphatases implicated in human diseases (reviewed in Refs. 15Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The VH1-like DSPs are an ancient group of enzymes found in archaeobacteria, cyanobacteria, viruses, yeasts, plants, and animals. We have identified 43 VH1-like DSPs in the human genome, all but one of which are also found in mouse. 2H.-H. Chen et al., manuscript in preparation. Many VH1-like DSPs have been shown to function as negative regulators of MAPK signaling pathways. MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on both the Thr and the Tyr residues in the TXY motif of their activation loop, catalyzed by kinases upstream in the signaling pathway (17Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 18Canagarajah B.J.

Dephosphorylation of these residues returns the MAPKs to their inactive state. This can be achieved either by single specificity PTPs and protein Ser/Thr phosphatases acting on the individual Tyr and Thr phosphorylation sites (reviewed in Refs. 19Keyse S.M. Semin. Cell Dev.

In addition, several other small VH1-like DSPs, which lack the N-terminal regulatory motif, are also reported to target MAPKs as physiological substrates, and these include VHR and MKP6 (3Todd J.L.

A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), is a single domain protein of ∼20 kDa and is expressed in most cell lines and tissues (3Todd J.L. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. J. Biol.

VHR has been shown to target Erk, Jnk, and p38 as substrates, preferentially dephosphorylating the phosphotyrosyl residue in the TXY motifs of MAPK (3Todd J.L. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 34Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Structural studies on VHR illustrate that the amino acids contributing to this preference for tyrosine include two unique bulky residues in its signature motif (35Schumacher M.A. Todd J.L. Rice A.E. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3009-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Four other VH1-like DSPs in the human genome were found to be closely related to VHR;2 they are testis and skeletal muscle-specific dual specificity phosphatase (TMDP) (36Nakamura K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Haneji T. Kikuchi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 819-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and three novel DSPs. The mRNA of TMDP is detected only in skeletal muscle and testis, and based on mRNA localization and expression in development, TMDP is proposed to be involved in spermatogenesis (36Nakamura K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Haneji T. Kikuchi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 819-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether TMDP protein is expressed in these two tissues was not established. Here we describe the characterization of a gene (DUSP13 locus) encoding two distinct VH1-like DSPs. One product from this gene is one of the three novel DSPs that are also closely related to VHR, and the other is the previously characterized TMDP. These two DSPs share no overlapping coding sequence. We have detected the endogenous expression of both DSP proteins, and we characterized the mRNA species produced from this gene, proving that two closely related phosphatases are generated from different open reading frames (ORFs) in one gene. Both proteins showed strict, yet distinct, tissue specificity. Our data also implied that both DSPs are involved in postnatal development of specific tissues. Based on the specific tissue expression patterns, we named the novel DSP MDSP (muscle-restricted dual specificity phosphatase). To our knowledge, the DUSP13 locus is the first gene from which two distinct proteins of the same family are expressed using alternative ORFs.

To generate the N-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MAP kinase expression constructs pCG-HA-Jnk1, pCG-HA-p38α and pCG-HA-p38β2, inserts from the source constructs were PCR-amplified and ligated into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCGN. pCG-HA-Erk2 was generated similarly by PCR and ligating into the XbaI and XmaI sites. PCEP4-MKP1-(1–314)-Myc WT and C258S were constructed by ligating the EcoRI and BamHI fragment from pSG5–3CH134-Myc-(7) into a pCEP4 vector. Human MDSP and TMDP constructs were generated by RT-PCR from polyadenylated RNA from human skeletal muscle and testis (Clontech). Mouse MDSP and TMDP constructs were generated by PCR from first strand cDNA from mouse skeletal muscle and testis (BD Biosciences). The PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Clontech) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. VHR-pT7 was a gift from J. Denu (University of Wisconsin, Madison). Human MDSP (hMDSP) and VHR were cloned into the Gateway System vector pDONR201 (Invitrogen) by PCR amplification followed by recombination. hMDSP-C129S, hMDSP-D97A, hMDSP-R135M, and VHR-D92A constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression constructs pDEST15-hMDSP, pDEST27-hMDSP (WT, R135M), and pDEST27-hVHR (WT, D92A) were generated by recombination from the pDONR vectors to the destination vectors. The bacterial expression constructs of maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions of human and mouse MDSP and mouse TMDP (pMAL-c2e-hMDSP, pMAL-c2e-mMDSP, and pMAL-c2e-mTMDP) were generated by PCR amplification and ligation into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the vector pMALc2e (New England Biolabs). The bacterial expression constructs of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of mouse MDSP and mouse TMDP (pGEX-KG-mMDSP and pGEX-KG-mTMDP) were generated by PCR amplification and ligation into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the vector pGEX-KG (37Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—To produce the GST fusions of human and mouse MDSP and TMDP, pDEST15-hMDSP, pGEX-KG-mMDSP, and pGEX-KG-mTMDP were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene). After induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 16 °C for 16 h, the bacteria were harvested and resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml lysozyme) and incubated on ice for 15 min before lysing by sonication in 0.5% Triton X-100. Clarified lysates were incubated at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline, and the beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. The GST fusion proteins were eluted in 20 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Eluates were used for phosphatase activity assays and antibody generation. The human and mouse MDSP and TMDP MBP fusion proteins were expressed in BL21-CodonPlus-RIL cells using the constructs pMAL-c2e-hMDSP, pMAL-c2e-mMDSP, and pMAL-c2e-mTMDP. The bacterial pellets were lysed in Buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) with 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme by repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The lysates were clarified, filtered through the 0.22-μm filters, loaded onto HiTrap Q columns, and eluted with Buffer B of increasing salt concentrations (25–800 mm NaCl). The fractions MBP fusion proteins were identified by immunoblotting, collected, dialyzed, and coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B for antibody purification. Antibody Generation and Purification—Affinity-purified GST fusion proteins were further purified by SDS-PAGE and electroelution. The resulting purified GST fusion proteins were used to immunize rabbits. The antisera were purified by using two subsequent MBP fusion protein columns. For purification of MDSP antibodies, the antiserum was first passed through an MBP-tagged TMDP column to remove antibodies directed against its epitope tag, and the MDSP-specific antibodies in the flow-through were affinity-purified over an MBP-tagged MDSP column. The TMDP antibodies were purified in a similar manner. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested in Lysis Buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 alternative (Calbiochem), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 mm benzamidine) or standard RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40 alternative, 0.5% deoxycholine, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors. 1 mm vanadate was included in buffers as indicated in the figure legends. For immunoprecipitation of overexpressed HA-tagged MAP kinases, 2 μl of monoclonal antibody 12CA5 ascites bound to 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose, and 0.5–1.5 mg of protein lysate were used in each reaction. Mouse and rat tissues were homogenized in standard RIPA buffer or Lysis Buffer using a hand-held Dounce homogenizer. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous TMDP, purified polyclonal antibodies CS1911 (40 μg) or CS1912 (20 μg) bound to 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 8 mg of rat testis lysate in RIPA buffer were used. Concentrations of purified antibodies used for immunoblotting of MDSP and TMDP were as follows: CS1911 (3 μg/ml), CS1912 (2 μg/ml), CS1914 (1 μg/ml), CS1875 (4 μg/ml), and CS1500 (10 μg/ml). Commercial antibodies were purchased from the following sources: monoclonal anti-α-tubulin clone B-5-1-2, Sigma; PY20, Transduction Laboratories. Phosphatase and Kinase Assays—Activity toward p-nitrophenol phosphate was measured in 96-well microplates at 25 °C in a 100-μl incubation mixture containing a three-component buffer (38Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) (100 mm acetic acid, 50 mm Bistris, and 50 mm Tris, pH 6.0, or 7.0, with 2 mm dithiothreitol) at increasing concentrations of p-nitrophenol phosphate from 0 to 20 mm, using 0.5–4.0 μg of GST-hMDSP in each reaction. Reactions were terminated at 20 min or as indicated with 100 μl of 0.1 m NaOH, 50% ethanol. The absorbance at 410 nm was measured using a microplate reader. The concentration of p-nitrophenolate produced was calculated using a molar absorptivity of 1.78 × 104m–1. Reduced carboxyamidomethylated and maleylated lysozyme (RCML) and poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) (Sigma) were phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP with β-IRK or PKA as described in Ref. 39Flint A.J.

Phosphatase assays using proteinaceous substrates were performed at 30 °C in a 60-μl mixture containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μm phosphorylated residues on substrates using 0.7–8 μg/ml of GST-hMDSP. In-gel phosphatase assays of the endogenous TMDP from rat testis were performed as described in Ref. 40Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar with the following modification. Because endogenous TMDP has the same apparent molecular weight as the rabbit immunoglobulin light chain, SDS-PAGE for in-gel assay and the immunoblotting were conducted under nonreducing conditions (no dithiothreitol) without iodoacetic acid. MAP kinase assays were conducted as described in Ref. 41Shen Y. Luche R. Wei B. Gordon M.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Culture and Transfection—COS1 cells and C2C12 myoblasts were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Growth Media (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). Transfections were conducted using various expression constructs and the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells are generally harvested 36–72 h post-transfection. Primary myoblasts were isolated from 4- to 6-week-old mouse limbs by mincing and protease digestion followed by centrifugation in a 40–70% Percoll gradient. Myoblasts were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in 20% fetal bovine serum, 5 ng/ml FGF-2, 1% penicillin/streptomycin in F-10 media. Myotube formation of both C2C12 cells and primary myoblasts was induced with Differentiation Media (2% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). Indirect Immunofluorescence—C2C12 cells were seeded on acid-washed coverslips and incubated in Growth Media. Cells were switched into Differentiation Media after reaching ∼90% confluence. Differentiated myotubes were transfected on the 4th day in Differentiation Media and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on the 7th day. Undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts, COS1 cells, and HeLa cells were fixed on the 3rd day after transfection. Two DSPs Were Encoded in Alternative ORFs from One Gene—In our search for novel DSPs in the human genome, we found sequences encoding two distinct DSP catalytic domains located close to each other on human chromosome 10q22.2. Each of the ORFs spanned nonoverlapping exons (Fig. 1A). One of the DSPs is the human form of TMDP, a murine phosphatase referred to as Testis and Muscle-specific Dual specificity Phosphatase (36Nakamura K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Haneji T. Kikuchi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 819-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second was a novel protein, which we have named MDSP, Muscle-restricted Dual Specificity Phosphatase (Fig. 1B, GenBank™ accession numbers AY674051 (human MDSP) and AY674052 (mouse MDSP)). We have conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the VH1-like DSPs found in the human genome and observed that MDSP and TMDP are closely related (42% identity in amino acid sequence). They belong to a subgroup of DSPs containing five mammalian proteins, of which the best characterized is VHR (38% identity with MDSP and 37% identity with TMDP) (33Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Comparison of this gene to the corresponding locus in the mouse genome showed that the gene structure is well conserved between human and mouse (Fig. 1C), and the murine locus would be predicted to encode proteins of 85 and 87% identity to human MDSP and TMDP, respectively. Both the size and the nucleotide sequence identity are conserved in the 9 exons identified from available EST sequences, whereas the majority of the intronic sequences are not conserved. In the genome of Fugu rubripes, the VHR-like subgroup of DSPs appeared to be expanded, whereas the majority of the other VH1-like DSPs in Fugu showed one-to-one matches to the human DSPs.2 At least 13 VHR-like DSP sequences were found in the Fugu genome, with multiple pairs located closely on the genomic sequence scaffolds. The arrangement of the genomic sequence of one of those pairs was similar to that of the mammalian DUSP13 locus, suggesting that this gene structure may also be conserved in Fugu. Detection of MDSP and TMDP Transcripts in Specific Tissues—The conservation of the gene structure between species suggested functional significance. Therefore, we investigated whether each of the two ORFs were transcribed into messenger RNA. Probes against the TMDP ORF were used to screen a multiple human tissue Northern blot. Expression of the TMDP sequence was only detected in skeletal muscle and testis among the 16 human tissues examined (data not shown); this result is similar to the original observation for the mouse gene (36Nakamura K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Haneji T. Kikuchi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 819-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple bands of varying sizes from 1 to 1.8 kb were detected from both tissues. To decipher the different transcripts expressed in skeletal muscle and testis, we examined further the expression pattern of different exons in each of the two tissues using Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. DNA probes were generated against exon 1, exon 2, exon 3, exons 4-5, and exons 7–9, respectively, and each of the probes was tested for specificity by Southern dot blot analyses (data not shown). The exon-specific probes were used to detect the expression of the exon in human skeletal muscle and testis mRNAs by Northern blotting. We found that mRNA species containing exons 1–3, which represent the MDSP ORF, could be detected in skeletal muscle but not in testis, whereas exons 7–9, which represent the human homologue of TMDP, were expressed at comparable levels in both tissues (Fig. 2A). In addition, exons 4 and 5 are also only expressed in skeletal muscle. To determine whether exons 1–5 are located on the same transcripts as exons 7–9 in skeletal muscle, we performed nonquantitative RT-PCR analysis using exon-specific primers (Fig. 2B). Transcripts containing exons 7–9 were present at comparable levels in both skeletal muscle and testis, whereas mRNA containing exons 1–5 are present at much higher amounts in skeletal muscle, although trace amounts of expression can be detected in testis by RT-PCR. We found multiple PCR products at much higher levels in skeletal muscle than in testis when a forward primer specific to exon 1 and a reverse primer specific to exon 9 (primer pair D) were used. We cloned this pool of PCR products from skeletal muscle and determined the identity of these products by DNA sequencing (Fig. 2C). Out of the 75 clone"

Remarkably, the pgm2Δ strain also exhibits a severe imbalance in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis when grown under these conditions. In the present study, we examined how the pgm2Δ mutation alters yeast Ca2+ homeostasis in greater detail. We found that a shift from glucose to galactose as the carbon source resulted in a 2-fold increase in the rate of cellular Ca2+ uptake in wild-type cells, whereas Ca2+ uptake increased 8-fold in the pgm2Δ mutant. Disruption of the PMC1 gene, which encodes the vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase Pmc1p, suppressed the Ca2+-related phenotypes observed in the pgm2Δ strain. This suggests that excessive vacuolar Ca2+ uptake is tightly coupled to these defects in Ca2+ homeostasis. An in vitro assay designed to measure Ca2+ sequestration into intracellular compartments confirmed that the pgm2Δ mutant contained a higher level of Pmc1p-dependent Ca2+ transport activity than the wild-type strain. We found that this increased rate of vacuolar Ca2+ uptake also coincided with a large induction of the unfolded protein response in the pgm2Δ mutant, suggesting that Ca2+ uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum compartment was reduced. These results indicate that the excessive Ca2+ uptake and accumulation previously shown to be associated with the pgm2Δ mutation are due to a severe imbalance in the distribution of cellular Ca2+ into different intracellular compartments.

These results indicate that the excessive Ca2+ uptake and accumulation previously shown to be associated with the pgm2Δ mutation are due to a severe imbalance in the distribution of cellular Ca2+ into different intracellular compartments. The regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in eukaryotic cells is a remarkably intricate process. Ca2+ transport across the plasma membrane and its intracellular sequestration is tightly regulated such that the resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is maintained in a range of 50–200 nm (1Iida H.

Small variations in cytosolic Ca2+ that occur in response to a number of stimuli are sufficient to activate a variety of Ca2+-sensing proteins, such as calmodulin and calcineurin. This then leads to the induction of various downstream signal transduction pathways (5Putney Jr., J.W. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 143-160PubMed Google Scholar). Equally as important, the Ca2+ concentrations within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CCE, capacitative Ca2+ entry; PGM, phosphoglucomutase; wt, wild-type strain; UPR, unfolded protein response; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Glc-1-P, glucose 1-phosphate; YP, yeast extract/peptone; SM, synthetic medium; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CCE, capacitative Ca2+ entry; PGM, phosphoglucomutase; wt, wild-type strain; UPR, unfolded protein response; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Glc-1-P, glucose 1-phosphate; YP, yeast extract/peptone; SM, synthetic medium; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. and Golgi apparatus are carefully maintained to ensure the proper folding and processing of proteins transported through the secretory pathway (6Michalak M. Robert Parker J.M. Opas M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the vacuole is the major cellular Ca2+ storage compartment and contains >95% of total cellular Ca2+ (7Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This large store of Ca2+ is maintained through the action of two transporters, the Ca2+-ATPase Pmc1p and the Ca2+/H+ exchanger Vcx1p (8Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Once thought to be relatively static by virtue of its association with inorganic polyphosphate (7Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the vacuolar Ca2+ store has recently been suggested to be more dynamic in nature. The recently identified yeast transient receptor potential channel homologue, Yvc1p, was shown to localize to the vacuolar membrane and mediate Ca2+ efflux out of the vacuole (10Palmer C.P. Zhou X.L. Lin J. Loukin S.H. Kung C. Saimi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7801-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Additional reports have shown that vacuolar Ca2+ efflux by Yvc1p can be specifically induced by hypotonic shock, which may be mediated by a mechano-sensitive mechanism (11Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12Zhou X.L. Batiza A.F. Loukin S.H. Palmer C.P. Kung C. Saimi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to the vacuole, the ER and Golgi apparatus are also important for maintaining proper intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in yeast. The transporters responsible for maintaining proper Ca2+ levels in the secretory pathway include the Ca2+-ATPases Pmr1p (3Miseta A. Fu L. Kellermayer R. Buckley J. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol.

Pmr1p is localized primarily to the Golgi apparatus, where it plays an essential role in maintaining the lumenal Ca2+ concentration required for the proper glycosylation and processing of proteins in this compartment (13Rudolph H.K.

Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The loss of Pmr1p results in a number of alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis, including an increased rate of cellular Ca2+ uptake from the extracellular environment and a greater sensitivity to elevated extracellular Ca2+ levels (15Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The elevated Ca2+ uptake observed in the pmr1Δ mutant is mediated by the MID1 and CCH1 gene products and is reminiscent of the mammalian capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) response (21Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The depletion of secretory pathway Ca2+ stores caused by the pmr1Δ mutation also leads to improper folding and processing of proteins that transit through the ER and Golgi (14Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 22Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that this lumenal Ca2+ depletion induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) (23Bonilla M. Nastase K.K. Cunningham K.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2343-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The UPR is activated by the presence of unfolded proteins in the ER and results in the increased expression of molecular chaperones that aid in protein folding in this compartment (24Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This increased expression is mediated by the transcription factor Hac1p/Ern4p (25Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2583-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 26Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T.

Recent evidence suggests that some products of carbohydrate metabolism also influence intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in yeast cells. In particular, the sugar phosphates Glc-6-P and Glc-1-P have been proposed to play a role in modulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (28Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Aiello D.P. Fu L. Miseta A. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45751-45758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The enzyme phosphoglucomutase (PGM) interconverts Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P and is required for the metabolism of galactose. Yeast strains lacking the major isoform of this enzyme (pgm2Δ) accumulate a high level of intracellular Glc-1-P when galactose is utilized as the carbon source due to a metabolic bottleneck in the conversion of Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P. This strain also exhibits alterations in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis under these conditions, including dramatically increased Ca2+ uptake and accumulation, sensitivity to high extracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and increased sensitivity to the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (28Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Most recently, it was demonstrated that the simultaneous overproduction of both Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P restored normal Ca2+ homeostasis, suggesting that the ratio of these glucose metabolites plays an important role in controlling this process (29Aiello D.P. Fu L. Miseta A. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45751-45758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study our results indicate that the pgm2Δ strain experiences elevated vacuolar Ca2+ uptake and reduced ER Ca2+ sequestration when grown with galactose as the carbon source. Furthermore, we show that these phenotypes are suppressed by the deletion of the MC1 gene. These results demonstrate that the relative levels of Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P play an important role in regulating the distribution of Ca2+ into different intracellular compartments. Strains and Plasmids Used—Yeast strain YDB0316 is a wild-type strain described previously (28Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The PGM2 gene in YDB0316 was disrupted by insertion of a previously described fragment containing the LEU2 gene (28Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to generate YDB0473. To generate strains YDB0484 (pmc1Δ) and YDB0483 (pgm2Δ/pmc1Δ), the PMC1 gene was disrupted using standard methods (30Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar) in YDB0316 (wt) and YDB0473 (pgm2Δ) using the S. cerevisiae HIS3 open reading frame that was PCR-amplified from pRS313 (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used to generate this product were DB1158 (5′-TAGAAAAGTG GTTCTAAAAA AAAAAAACTG TGTGCGTAAC AAAAAAAATA GCTTGGTGAG CGCTAGGAGT-3′) and DB1159 (5′-CAATTTTGAA AATATAACTA TTACACACAT CTTTTCATTT GGTCACTTAC CTGTTCGTAT ACATACTTAC TGAC-3′). To generate strains YDB0475 (vcx1Δ) and YDB0474 (pgm2Δ/vcx1Δ), the VCX1 gene was disrupted using standard methods (30Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar) in YDB0316 (wt) and YDB0473 (pgm2Δ) with a previously described knockout construct (3Miseta A. Fu L. Kellermayer R. Buckley J. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For each strain, gene disruptions were confirmed by PCR, Southern blotting, and/or PGM enzymatic assays (28Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, strain BY4741 (wild type) and the isogenic yvc1Δ strain BY4741 (clone 1863) were purchased form Open Biosystems. A pgm2::LEU2 disruption construct (28Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol.

The induction of UPR signaling was monitored using the reporter plasmid pMCZ-Y (a kind gift from Kazutoshi Mori) that contains lacZ under the control of the yeast CYC1 promoter containing an unfolded protein response element (26Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Culture Media—Bacterial strains used for cloning and plasmid maintenance were grown in standard media as described (32Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Similarly, yeast media were prepared as described (30Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Yeast extract/peptone (YP) medium and synthetic medium (SM) were supplemented with 2% glucose (dextrose) (YPD or SMD) or 2% galactose (YPGal or SMGal). YPD and YPGal media were routinely buffered to pH 5.5 with 40 mm MES-Tris. To prepare membranes for in vitro45Ca2+ uptake assays, cells were grown in Yeast Mito medium containing 6.7 g of yeast nitrogen base (Difco) and 0.3% yeast extract (Difco)/liter in the presence of 2% glucose or 2% galactose (YMMG) (33Koh J.Y. Hajek P. Bedwell D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures were grown for a minimum of five generations to ≤1.0 A600 units/ml before harvesting. Measurement of Whole Cell Ca2+Uptake, Total Cellular Ca2+, and Exchangeable Ca2+Pools—Whole cell Ca2+ uptake measurements were performed as described previously (15Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Aiello D.P. Fu L. Miseta A. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45751-45758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Measurement of total cell Ca2+ by flame photometry was also carried out as previously described (3Miseta A. Fu L. Kellermayer R. Buckley J. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Aiello D.P. Fu L. Miseta A. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45751-45758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells for Ca2+ exchange experiments were grown in YPGal medium to a density of 0.05 A600. The medium was then supplemented with 45Ca2+, and growth was continued to a cell density of 0.5–1 A600/ml. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min, washed, and resuspended in fresh YPGal supplemented with 50 mm CaCl2. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed, filtered, washed, and processed for scintillation counting as previously described (3Miseta A. Fu L. Kellermayer R. Buckley J. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assays—Yeast strains transformed with plasmid pMCZ-Y were grown to mid-log phase in SMGal medium as indicated. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation and permeabilized by repeated freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen (34Schneider S. Buchert M. Hovens C.M. Biotechniques. 1996; 20: 960-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed using the colorimetric substrate 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside according to a previously described protocol (35Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). To examine the affect of extracellular Ca2+ and dithiothreitol (DTT), cells were treated with 20 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm DTT, respectively, for 4 h before harvest. Units of β-galactosidase activity are defined as the absorbance at 420 nm × 103/min/A600 unit of cells. Isolation and Subcellular Fractionation of Total Cell Membranes— Total cell membranes were isolated from yeast using a protocol based on previous publications (14Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 16Marchi V. Sorin A. Wei Y. Rao R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown at 30 °Cin the indicated media to 0.6–0.8 A600 units/ml. Before harvest, NaN3 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the cells were rapidly chilled in ice water for 10 min. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 6000 rpm (6000 × g) in a Sorvall SLA-3000 rotor. Cell pellets were resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaN3, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 0.3 mg/ml yeast lytic enzyme (ICN). Cells were converted to spheroplasts by incubation for 30–45 min at 37 °C. The spheroplasts were then harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 2500 rpm (750 × g) in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor and gently resuspended in lysis buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 20 mm triethanolamine acetate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin; all from Sigma). The spheroplasts were then disrupted mechanically using 20 strokes of a Wheaton Type A (tight) Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysates were then cleared of unbroken cells by centrifugation twice at 4 °C for 5 min at 2000 rpm (450 × g) in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. To fractionate membranes, 3 ml of lysate was loaded onto a 10-step (18–54% in 4% increments) sucrose gradient in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2. Gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C for 2 h at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-28 rotor. After centrifugation, gradient fractions were collected manually in 3-ml aliquots from top to bottom. Individual fractions from multiple gradients were then pooled and stored at –80 °C in 1-ml aliquots. Protein concentrations in each gradient fraction were determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin to generate a standard curve (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Ca2+Uptake Assays in Isolated Membranes—To assay for Ca2+ transport activity in sucrose gradient fractions, 0.7 ml of O-Buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.7, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP (pre-buffered to pH 6.7), 5 mm NaN3, 0.5 μCi/ml 45CaCl2 (9.6 mCi/mg)) was added to 0.3 ml of gradient fraction and incubated for 12 min at 25 °C (36Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The entire 1-ml sample was then collected by filtration through a pre-washed nitrocellulose filter (Millipore, HAWP02500) and washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl) (36Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Membrane-sequestered 45Ca2+ was then determined by liquid scintillation counting. Where indicated, Ca2+ transport by Vcx1p was inhibited by the addition of 25 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (Sigma). To test for the effect of sugar phosphates on Ca2+ uptake, pre-buffered (pH 6.7) glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, or mannose 6-phosphate was added to the O-Buffer mix at the indicated concentrations as indicated. To test for the effect on Ca2+ uptake by free phosphate, 5 mm sodium phosphate was added to the O-Buffer mix as indicated. A Sustained Increase in Cellular Ca2+Uptake Occurs upon Carbon Source Shift—Previous studies show that the pgm2Δ mutation causes increased cellular Ca2+ uptake and accumulation when galactose is utilized as the carbon source (28Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Aiello D.P. Fu L. Miseta A. Bedwell D.M. J.

Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This increase in Ca2+ uptake coincides with a large increase in the level of intracellular Glc-1-P and a resulting alteration in the Glc-1-P/Glc-6-P ratio. It has been proposed that the altered ratio of these glucose metabolites induces a mechanism that normally couples their relative abundance to intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (28Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Aiello D.P. Fu L. Miseta A. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This model predicts that wild-type cells shifted from the metabolism of glucose to galactose should also experience a significant increase in Ca2+ uptake. To test this hypothesis, we measured 45Ca2+ uptake in the wild-type and pgm2Δ strains after a carbon source shift from glucose to galactose (Fig. 1). The rates of 45Ca2+ uptake in the wild-type and pgm2Δ strains were similar before the shift. We found that the rate of 45Ca2+ uptake in the wild-type strain increased 2-fold within 6 h of re-suspending the cells in medium containing galactose as the carbon source and remained constant thereafter. In contrast, the pgm2Δ mutant exhibited a 4-fold increase in 45Ca2+ uptake 6 h after the shift, and uptake increased to 8-fold higher than the pre-shift level after 12 h. These results support the hypothesis that a component of the normal adaptive response of yeast cells to the utilization of galactose as the carbon source is an increase in Ca2+ transport across the plasma membrane. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the defect in Ca2+ homeostasis observed in the pgm2Δ strain may result from an inability to properly regulate this normal physiological response due to the overproduction of Glc-1-P in this strain. Disruption of the PMC1 Gene Partially Suppresses Phenotypes Associated With the pgm2Δ Mutation—The vacuole serves as the major Ca2+ storage compartment in yeast (7Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Given the high rate of cellular Ca2+ uptake observed when the pgm2Δ strain utilizes galactose as carbon source, we reasoned that efficient vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration might be critical for the viability of this strain. To determine the consequences of reducing the level of vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration in the pgm2Δ mutant, we disrupted the genes encoding the vacuolar Ca2+ ATPase Pmc1p and the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger Vcx1p both independently and together in the pgm2Δ strain. The loss of Vcx1p activity had no effect on the growth of the pgm2Δ mutant (data not shown). Surprisingly, the pmc1Δ mutation partially suppressed the slow growth and Ca2+ sensitivity phenotypes of the pgm2Δ mutant on both standard YPGal plates and on YPGal plates supplemented with 50 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Combining both the pmc1Δ and vcx1Δ mutations together in the pgm2Δ mutant provided no greater suppression than that observed for the pmc1Δ mutation alone (data not shown). These results suggest that vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration mediated by Pmc1p may be detrimental to growth of the pgm2Δ strain. To determine whether this partial suppression of the pgm2Δ growth defect by the pmc1Δ mutation correlated with changes in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, we next measured the level of total cellular Ca2+ accumulation in strains grown with galactose as the carbon source (Fig. 3). As reported previously, the pgm2Δ mutant exhibited a 4-fold higher level of total cell Ca2+ than the wild-type strain. Consistent with the observed growth phenotypes, the pgm2Δ/vcx1Δ double mutant had a level of total cell Ca2+ that was similar to the level measured in the pgm2Δ mutant. In contrast, the pgm2Δ/pmc1Δ strain had a level of total cell Ca2+ that was only 1.5-fold higher than that found in the wild-type strain. These results demonstrate that the introduction of the pmc1Δ mutation (and presumably a reduction in vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration) coincides with the suppression of the Ca2+ homeostasis phenotypes observed in the pgm2Δ strain. Intracellular Ca2+ in yeast has been shown to exist in two distinct states termed the exchangeable and non-exchangeable pools (7Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exchangeable pool was so named because it was rapidly released from yeast cells when they were introduced into medium containing a limiting level of extracellular Ca2+. In contrast, the non-exchangeable pool of cellular Ca2+ was released from the cell under these conditions at a much slower rate. Until recently, the non-exchangeable pool of cellular Ca2+ was thought to be largely synonymous with the vacuole pool, where it is thought to exist in complex with polyphosphate (7Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the exchangeable pool was thought to represent Ca2+ located primarily within the ER and Golgi compartments. Thus, our finding that the exchangeable Ca2+ pool in the pgm2Δ strain was not reduced when grown with galactose as the carbon source suggested that the Ca2+ level was not depleted in the compartments of the secretory pathway. However, Cyert and Denis (11Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) recently found that a fraction of the vacuolar Ca2+ store is more dynamic than previously thought and can be rapidly released"

The aromatic hydrocarbon adduct studies delineated the margins of the functional DNA interface at atomic resolution but did not reveal the nature of the DNA contacts within the essential zone of DNA. Modifications of the nonbridging and 5′-bridging oxygens of the DNA phosphodiester backbone have been especially informative in that regard.

Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), phosphorothiolate substitutions for the 5′-bridging oxygens of the scissile strand have no significant effect on the rate of DNA cleavage by vaccinia topoisomerase (6Krogh B.O. Cheng C. Burgin A. Shuman S. Virology. 1999; 264: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A major outstanding question is how the poxvirus topoisomerase reads the nucleotide sequence at its cleavage site. Available evidence suggests that most of the site specificity is achieved at the level of transesterification chemistry rather than at the noncovalent DNA binding step (24Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5360-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whereas the affinity for the target site, the rate of cleavage, and the cleavage equilibrium constant (Kcl) are affected by the nucleotide sequence context surrounding the 5′-(C/T)CCTT target site (1Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hwang Y. Burgin A. Bushman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9160-9168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in ways that are not well understood in structural terms, the dominant factor triggering the DNA incision reaction is the pentamer 5′-CCCTT/3′-GGGAA. We have begun to systematically address the features of the individual bases that affect the kinetics of DNA cleavage via position-specific base modifications entailing relatively small additions to, or subtractions from, the standard base structures (11Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31731-31734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yakovleva L. Tian L. Sayer J.M. Kalena G.P. Kroth H. Jerina D.M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42170-42177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), as well as modification by more bulky adducts (16Tian L. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Kalena G. Jerina D.M.

The addition of new substituents to the purine and pyrimidine rings provides a means of mapping functionally relevant sites of protein-DNA contact. The caveat to the new substituent approach is that a particular site of modification interference (presumably arising via steric hindrance) cannot be equated with a specific atomic interaction with the DNA. Rather, the power of the new substituent approach resides mainly in its ability to identify DNA structural elements that are not functionally relevant. Moreover, the sensitivity of the base modification method necessarily depends on the extent to which the particular modification alters the size, shape, and hydrogen-bonding potential of the base or base pair. In general, the most informative modification interference effects will be those elicited by the subtlest modifications. A corollary of this proposition is that the most straightforward approach to assessing the relevance of a given base to topoisomerase catalysis is to remove the base rather than add new substituents to the base. Missing base analysis has been facilitated by the availability of synthetic DNAs containing position-specific tetrahydrofuran (THF) 1The abbreviation used is: THF, tetrahydrofuran. abasic sites (Fig. 1). Other investigators have shown that abasic lesions flanking cleavage sites for mammalian DNA topoisomerase I or topoisomerase II can act as “topoisomerase poisons” that trap the normally transient covalent topoisomerase-DNA intermediate by causing a selective slowing of the religation transesterification reaction relative to the cleavage transesterification reaction (25Pourquier P. Ueng L. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Such studies have broad physiological relevance insofar as: (i) abasic lesions arise in vivo with high frequency as a consequence of base-excision repair by DNA glycosidases, and (ii) topoisomerases may reinforce the cytotoxicity of DNA lesions (27Nitiss J.L. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Waltman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26708-26714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we conduct a systematic analysis of the effects of abasic lesions at six positions of the scissile strand and six positions of the nonscissile strand within the target sequence 5′-CCCTTA/3′-GGGAAT. The key instructive findings are that individual bases, not the base pairs, are critical determinants of the rate of DNA cleavage. We also find that abasic lesions at the +1 and -1 positions flanking the scissile phosphodiester slow the rate of religation and thereby poison the topoisomerase reaction equilibrium. DNA Substrates—Oligodeoxyriboncucleotides containing single THF abasic sites were commercially synthesized and gel-purified by Oligos Etc. Inc. (Wilsonville, OR) or synthesized by standard solid-phase methodology and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography before and after removal of the 5′-dimethoxytrityl protecting group. The CCCTT-containing scissile strands were 5′-32P-labeled by enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotides were gel-purified and hybridized to standard or modified nonscissile strand oligonucleotides at a 1:4 molar ratio of scissile to nonscissile strand. Annealing reaction mixtures containing 0.2 m NaCl and oligonucleotides were heated to 80 °C and then slow-cooled to 22 °C. The hybridized DNAs were stored at 4 °C. The structures of the annealed duplexes and the sequences of the component strands are depicted in the figures. Vaccinia Topoisomerase—Recombinant vaccinia topoisomerase was produced in Escherichia coli (BL21) by infection with bacteriophage λCE6 (28Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then purified to apparent homogeneity from the soluble bacterial lysate by phosphocellulose and Source S-15 chromatography steps. Protein concentration was determined by using the dye binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Single-turnover DNA Cleavage—Reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of CCCTT-containing DNA, and 75, 150, or 300 ng (2, 4, or 8 pmol) of vaccinia topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at various times and quenched immediately with SDS (1% final concentration). The products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Free DNA migrated near the dye front. Covalent complex formation was revealed by transfer of radiolabeled DNA to the topoisomerase. The extent of covalent complex formation was quantified by scanning the dried gel using a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imager. A plot of the percentage of input DNA cleaved versus time established the end point values for cleavage. The data were then normalized to the end point values (defined as 100%), and the cleavage rate constants (kcl) were calculated by fitting the normalized data to the equation 100 - % cleavage(norm) = 100e-kt. Single-turnover Religation—Cleavage reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 0.3 pmol of 32P-labeled 18-mer/30-mer DNA (unmodified or abasic) and 2, 4, or 8 pmol of topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C for 10-60 min to form the suicide intermediate. Religation was initiated by the simultaneous addition of NaCl to 0.5 m anda5′-OH 18-mer acceptor strand d(GTTCCGATAGTGACTACA) to a concentration of 15 pmol/22 μl (i.e. a 50-fold molar excess over the input DNA substrate). Aliquots were withdrawn at various times and quenched immediately with 1% SDS. A time 0 sample was withdrawn prior to addition of the acceptor strand. The samples were digested for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 μg of proteinase K, then mixed with an equal volume of 95% formamide 20 mm EDTA, heat-denatured, and analyzed by electrophoresis through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). Religation of the covalently bound 12-mer strand to the 18-mer acceptor DNA yielded a 5′-32P-labeled 30-mer strand transfer product. The extent of religation (expressed as the percent of the covalent intermediate converted into 30-mer) was plotted as a function of reaction time. The data were normalized to the end point values and krel was determined by fitting the data to the equation 100 - % religated(norm) = 100e-kt. Equilibrium Cleavage—A 34-mer CCCTT-containing oligonucleotide was 5′-32P-labeled, then gel-purified and annealed to an unlabeled complementary 30-mer strand to form a duplex containing 12 bp of DNA 5′ to the cleavage site and 18 bp 3′ to the cleavage site. Reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of 34-mer/30-mer DNA, and 9, 18, 37, 75, 150, or 300 ng of topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were initiated by the addition of topoisomerase to prewarmed reaction mixtures. The reaction was quenched by adding SDS to 0.5%. The samples were digested for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 μg of proteinase K, mixed with an equal volume of formamide/EDTA, and then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. The cleavage product, a 32P-labeled 12-mer bound to a short peptide, was well resolved from the input 34-mer substrate. The extent of strand cleavage was quantified by scanning the gel. The Kcl is defined as the ratio of covalently bound DNA to noncovalently bound DNA at the reaction end point under conditions of saturating enzyme and was calculated according to the equation Kcl = % cleaved/(100 - % cleaved). Position-specific Scissile Strand Abasic Interference Effects on DNA Cleavage—A series of oligodeoxynucleotide 18-mer scissile strands containing a single THF abasic site within the 5′-C+5C+4C+3T+2T+1A-1 sequence were 5′-32P-labeled and then annealed to an unlabeled 30-mer strand to form “suicide” cleavage substrates for vaccinia topoisomerase (Fig. 1B). The presence of the abasic lesions at the correct positions was assessed by limited digestion of the suicide substrates with E. coli exonuclease III, which possesses 3′-exonuclease and abasic endonuclease activities. Whereas exonuclease III digests the unmodified suicide substrate exclusively in the 3′-exonuclease mode to generate a ladder of partially shortened 5′-32P-labeled products (21Krogh B.O. Claeboe C.D. Hecht S.M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20907-20912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the abasic suicide substrates were also cleaved endonucleolytically at the 5′-phosphodiester flanking the abasic nucleoside to yield a discrete 5′-32P-labeled product (Fig. 2). Digestion in parallel of the six position-specific abasic substrates yielded a series of endonucleolytic cleavage products of the expected size and differing by 1-nucleotide spacing. The cleavage transesterification reaction of vaccinia topoisomerase results in covalent attachment of the 32P-labeled 12-mer 5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp to the enzyme via Tyr274. The unlabeled 6-mer 5′-OH leaving strand ATTCCC dissociates spontaneously from the protein-DNA complex. Loss of the leaving strand drives the reaction toward the covalent state, so that the reaction can be treated kinetically as a first-order unidirectional process. The reaction of excess topoisomerase with the unmodified control substrate attained an end point at which 95% of the DNA was converted to covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex; the reaction was complete within 20 s. The extent of transesterification after 5 s was 89% of the end point value. From this datum, we calculated a single-turnover kcl of 0.46 s-1 (Fig. 1B). Single abasic lesions spanning positions +5 to -1 on the scissile strand had no significant effect on the extents of DNA cleavage (90-98%), but they exerted disparate position-specific effects on the rate of the reaction. The kcl values for the +5 abasic (0.25 s-1) and +3 abasic substrates (0.18 s-1) were within a factor of 2 or 3 of the value for unmodified control DNA. In contrast, abasic lesions at +2, +1, and -1 slowed kcl by factors of 60 (to 0.0073 s-1), 260 (0.0018 s-1), and 350 (0.0013 s-1), respectively. The +4 abasic lesion caused a 10-fold decrement in kcl (0.043 s-1). These results indicate that: (i) vaccinia topoisomerase does not rely on contacts to the +5C or +3C bases during the forward transesterification reaction, and (ii) the most important contributions of the scissile strand bases are made by +2T, +1T, and -1N. Nonscissile Strand Abasic Effects on DNA Cleavage—An unmodified 5′-32P-labeled 18-mer scissile strand was annealed to a series of 30-mer nonscissile strands containing a single THF abasic site within the 3′-G+5G+4G+3A+2A+1T-1 element (Fig. 3). Single abasic lesions spanning positions +5 to -1 on the nonscissile strand had no significant effect on the extents of DNA cleavage (80-97%), but they elicited position-specific effects on the rate of cleavage that, with the exception of the +5 abasic site, were drastically different from the effects exerted by the loss of the complementary base on the scissile strand. The first instructive finding was that elimination of the +5G base at the “upstream” margin of the target site had no significant impact on kcl (0.33 s-1). Thus, neither component base of the +5C:G base pair was functionally important for the forward cleavage reaction. A second notable finding was that loss of the -1T base at the “downstream” margin on the nonscissile strand also had no effect on kcl (0.46 s-1), but in this case, there was a huge disparity between the benign effect of an abasic lesion on the nonscissile strand compared with the 350-fold decrement in kcl that occurred when the complementary -1A base was missing from the scissile strand. The kcl values for the +1 abasic (0.085 s-1), +2 abasic (0.046 s-1), +3 abasic (0.003 s-1), and +4 abasic (0.0035 s-1) substrates were slowed by factors of 5, 10, 150, and 130 relative to the kcl for unmodified DNA. A gradient of increasing severity of abasic interference was evident as the nonscissile strand lesion was phased away from the cleavage site; this contrasts with a severity gradient of opposite directionality for cleavage interference by abasic lesions on the scissile strand. The strand selectivity can be quantified as the ratio of the cleavage rate constants for the missing scissile strand and nonscissile strand bases of each base pair. These SS/NS abasic ratios are as follows: 0.75 for +5C:G, 12 for +4C:G, 60 for +3C:G, 0.15 for +2T:A, 0.02 for +1T:A, and 0.003 for -1A:T. Effects of Missing Base Pairs on DNA Cleavage—5′-32P-Labeled 18-mer scissile strands containing single abasic sites were annealed to abasic 30-mer nonscissile strands to form a series of suicide cleavage substrates lacking both complementary bases of each base pair within the CCCTTA element (Fig. 4). The effects of missing base pairs ranged from modest (e.g. +5, +3, and -1) to severe (+4, +2, and +1). The missing base pair interference effects we classify as modest were those that had little effect on the extent of cleavage (78-98%) and for which the rate decrement incurred by deleting both bases was either no worse than, or only modestly worse than, the interference caused by a single abasic lesion. We can quantify the missing base pair effect as the inverse ratio of the cleavage rate constant for the missing pair substrate to the slower of the two rate constants for a single abasic substrate lacking either the scissile or nonscissile strand base. For example, the missing base pair effect at position -1A:T was 1.1 (= 0.0013/0.0011), which means that complete elimination of the -1 base pair was no worse than deleting just the -1A base on the scissile strand. The missing base pair effect at +5C:G was 4 (= 0.25/0.059), but the notable finding was that the rate of cleavage of a DNA substrate lacking the +5C:G pair was slowed by only a factor of 8 compared with an unmodified DNA. The missing pair effect at +3C:G was 7 (= 0.003/0.00043). The +4, +2, and +1 missing pair interference effects we classify as severe affected the cleavage end point (11-62%) and elicited strongly synergistic effects on kcl compared with the single abasic lesions (Fig. 4). The missing base pair effects at +4C:G, +2T:A, and +1T:A were 440, 1300, and 240, respectively. It is likely that these severe effects of deleting both bases of the pair are caused by secondary structural changes to the DNA target site, especially to the phosphodiester backbone with which the topoisomerase makes electrostatic contacts that are essential for the cleavage reaction (8Tian L. Claeboe C.D. Hecht S.M. Shuman S. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Position-specific Abasic Interference with DNA Religation—The observed abasic interference effects on the rate of DNA cleavage could reflect a requirement for specific bases for either: (i) chemical catalysis of transesterification or (ii) DNA-assisted assembly of a catalytically competent active site. The observed rate of covalent complex formation by vaccinia topoisomerase with unmodified DNA is believed to be limited by the chemical step itself rather than by requisite precleavage conformational steps (29Kwon K. Stivers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 345-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The topoisomerase catalytic cycle entails two transesterification reactions, cleavage and religation. Religation occurs via the attack of the DNA 5′-OH on the covalent intermediate, leading to expulsion of the Tyr274 leaving group and restoration of the DNA phosphodiester backbone (30Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Religation is believed to be the microscopic reversal of the cleavage reaction. Thus, changes in the structure of the topoisomerase or the DNA target site that inhibit the chemical step directly will likely slow both the forward cleavage reaction and the DNA religation reaction. However, changes that impede active site assembly to the point that it becomes limiting for cleavage will affect the cleavage reaction selectively; they would have less impact on the rate of religation by the preformed covalent topoisomerase-DNA intermediate, in which the active site is already assembled correctly. Abasic effects on the religation reaction were studied under single-turnover conditions by assaying the ability of preformed suicide intermediate to transfer the covalently held 5′-32P-labeled 12-mer strand to a 5′-OH-terminated 18-mer strand to generate a 30-mer product (Fig. 5A). After forming the suicide intermediate on the unmodified 18-mer/30-mer DNA substrate or 18-mer/30-mer DNA containing an abasic lesion at positions +5, +4, +3, +2, or +1 of the scissile strand, the religation reaction was initiated by adding a 50-fold molar excess of the 18-mer DNA acceptor strand. The sequence of the added 18-mer is fully complementary to the 5′ single-stranded tail of the suicide intermediate. The ionic strength was adjusted simultaneously to 0.5 m NaCl to promote dissociation of the topoisomerase after strand ligation and prevent recleavage of the 30-mer strand transfer product. Aliquots were withdrawn immediately prior to the addition of 18-mer and NaCl (defined as time 0) and at various times afterward, and the extent of religation at each time point was expressed as the fraction of the 32P-labeled DNA present as covalent adduct at time 0 that was converted to 30-mer strand transfer product (Fig. 5B). Religation by topoisomerase bound covalently on unmodified DNA was effectively complete within 5 s, the earliest time point analyzed. The religation of covalent complexes containing +5, +4, or +3 abasic sites on the scissile strand was virtually indistinguishable from that of unmodified DNA, as gauged by the completeness of the reactions after 5 s (Fig. 5B). The religation results are consistent with the minimal/mild effects of the +5, +4, and +3 abasic lesions on the rate of the forward cleavage reaction. Note that the religation rate constant of vaccinia topoisomerase (krel ∼1.0-1.2 s-1) is too fast to measure manually, which means that the religation rate would have to be slowed at least severalfold to be detectable in our assays. The religation of covalent complexes containing +2 or +1 abasic lesions was effectively complete in 10 s; the reactions attained 56 and 52% of the end point values after 5 s, from which we estimated krel values of 0.16 and 0.15 s-1, respectively. We surmise that the +2 and +1T bases contribute no more than a ∼6-fold enhancement of the rate of religation, which contrasts with their 60- and 250-fo"

The role of ACE within the reninangiotensin system is well established, and inhibition of this enzyme is routinely used for therapeutic management of hypertension. ACE-like proteins have been identified in lower organisms, such as Drosophila (2Brakebush C. Varfolomeev E.E. Batkin M. Wallach D. J. Biol.

This evolutionary importance of ACE, coupled with its widespread distribution in many organs within a species, suggests that over and above its role in the renin-angiotensin system, ACE probably plays a much broader role in general physiology.

Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For rabbit ACE, the secretase cleaves between an Arg and a Ser residue, 22 residues N-terminal to the hydrophobic transmembrane domain, liberating the 631-residue soluble enzyme and leaving the C-terminal 73 residues, which includes the juxtamembrane residues, membrane-spanning domain, and cytoplasmic tail, in the tissue (17Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although shedding is generally recognized as an important post-translational modification affecting many important biological processes, little is known about the secretases or shed-dases involved in the proteolytic cleavage, their mode of action, and probable regulation by other cellular proteins. We have shown previously that shedding of ACE is a regulated process (17Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our approach to explore the regulation of shedding of ACE was to identify the cellular proteins that associate with ACE and to investigate the changes ACE and its associated proteins undergo when shedding is stimulated or inhibited. Our previous results have demonstrated the following. (i) Immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), a chaperone, interacts with ACE in the endoplasmic reticulum. The binding of BiP with ACE inhibits the rate of ACE shedding by retaining ACE precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (18Santhamma K.R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23253-23258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). (ii) Specific protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes associate with ACE in unstimulated cells. However, treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which is known to stimulate PKC, caused marked reduction in ACE association of selective PKC species, and a significant increase in ACE secretion (18Santhamma K.R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23253-23258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that pervanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, dramatically enhances shedding of ACE. Increased shedding is p38 MAP kinase-dependent and is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of ACE and BiP. Materials—Compound 3 ([N-[dl-[2-(hydroxyaminocarbonyl)methyl]-4-methylpentanoyl]-l-3-(tert-butyl)alanyl-l-alanine, 2-aminoethyl amide) was generously supplied by Dr. Roy Black (Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA). Tyrosine phosphate antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Sodium orthovanadate, PMA, and phenylarsine oxide are products of Sigma. GF109203X was purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). All kinase inhibitors were from Calbiochem. Pervanadate was freshly prepared for each experiment by combining equimolar amounts of H2O2 and sodium orthovanadate and diluting with medium within 20 min of preparation. Cell Labelings, Immunoprecipitation with Anti-ACE Antibody, and Quantitation of Cleavage and Secretion—Confluent ACE89 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min, and the label was chased for the indicated periods, as described earlier (8Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston W.I. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pervanadate, PMA, and other agents were added to the medium at the indicated time, as mentioned in the figure legends. At the end of the chase period, ACE was immunoprecipitated from media and cell extracts with a polyclonal antiserum raised against pure pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme. Immunoprecipitates were resolved in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE using Mini-Protean II gel apparatus (Bio-Rad) and visualized by fluorography (8Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston W.I. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To quantitate cleavage and secretion, the dried gels were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis; the amount of mature gACE present in the cell extract and medium combined was taken as 100%, and the amount present in the culture medium at that time was represented as cleaved and secreted (19Sadhukhan R. Sen G.C. Ramchandran R. Sen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cleavage Secretion of ACE Determined by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—ACE89 cells (60-70% confluent) were treated with goat anti-pulmonary ACE antiserum used for immunoprecipitation (1: 6000) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% NaN3 and 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in a similar fashion with the secondary antibody, affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat IgG made in rabbit. The cells were then washed with the modified phosphate-buffered saline mentioned above, scraped in the same buffer, and immediumtely used for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (serial number HO140; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The data obtained were analyzed by Flow Jo, version 4.5 (Tree Star Inc.). Cleavage Secretion of Biotinylated Cell Surface ACE—ACE89 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8), and biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotin-amido)hexanoate (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min at 4 °C. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed by three washes with ice-cold 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. Biotinylated cells were then transferred to serum-free culture medium prewarmed to 16 °C, with or without 100 μm pervanadate for desired time. After the incubation, cells were immediumtely chilled on ice, the culture medium was clarified by centrifugation, and the cell extract was prepared as mentioned earlier. ACE was immunoprecipitated from aliquots of cell extract and culture medium by polyclonal ACE antiserum, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking the membranes with bovine serum albumin (3%) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.05% Tween, the biotin-labeled ACE was quantitated by Western blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) diluted 1:500,000 with the blocking buffer; signals were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system and quantitated by Scion Image beta version 4.0.2. In a complementary assay, biotinylated ACE from similar aliquots of cell extract and culture medium were precipitated by immobilized streptavidin gel (Pierce), analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted with anti-ACE antibody, and quantified as mentioned above. In the experiments where the effect of monensin on cleavage secretion was monitored, the cells were first preincubated with 10 μm monensin for 1 h at 37 °C and then chilled on ice before cell surface proteins were biotinylated. Monensin was present throughout the experiment. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblottings with Tyrosine Phosphate Antibody—ACE89 cells were labeled and incubated with various agents, as described above. At the end of the incubation, the culture medium were discarded, and cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS (8Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston W.I. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoprecipitation with anti-tyrosine phosphate antibody (5 μl) and SDS-PAGE analysis was conducted, as mentioned above, except that radioimmune precipitation assay buffer described above was used for immunoprecipitation. The electrophoretically separated samples were transferred to Problot membranes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for Western blotting. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween for 1 h prior to incubation with tyrosine phosphate antibody (1:1000) in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween and then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody; signals were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For mass spectrometry analysis described in Fig. 3, 16-cm gels and corresponding trans-blot cells (Bio-Rad) were used instead of minigel. Enzyme Activity Measurement—ACE activity was assayed by using hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine as the substrate and measuring fluorometrically the His-Leu liberated at 5 mm hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine (20Sen I. Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25748-25754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure ACE activity in RTE cells isolated as described earlier (15Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar), the cell pellets were extracted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 300 mm NaCl for 1 h. After centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant containing solubilized sACE was appropriately diluted and assayed as described above (15Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing and Identification of Phosphotyrosine-containing Proteins—The proteins were identified by sequencing the peptides formed by an in-gel tryptic digestion using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (21Kintner M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, each band was cut from the gel, reduced, and alkylated prior to treatment with trypsin. The peptides that formed by the digestion were extracted from the polyacrylamide, and the digest was concentrated by evaporation to ∼25 μl. The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system was a Finnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometer system with a Protana microelectrospray ion source interfaced to a 10 cm × 50-μm inner diameter C18 reversed-phase capillary chromatography column. Two-μl volumes of the digest were injected, and the peptides were eluted from the column by an acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min. The mass spectrometry data were recorded using the data-dependent capability of the instrument to acquire full scan mass spectra (to determine peptide molecular weights) and collisionally induced dissociation spectra (to determine amino acid sequence) in successive instrument scans. This mode of analysis produces ∼1500 collisionally induced dissociation spectra, although not all spectra were derived from peptides. The data were analyzed by using all collisionally induced dissociation spectra collected to search the NCBI nonredundant data base with the search program TurboSequest. All matching spectra were verified by manual interpretation. Cleavage Secretion of ACE Is Stimulated by Pervanadate— ACE is cleaved and secreted into the culture medium from various transfected cell lines and primary cultures. ACE89 cells, a mouse mammary epithelial cell line transfected with rabbit gACE, synthesize large quantities of gACE that are transported to the plasma membrane, where gACE is proteolytically cleaved and the entire ectodomain is secreted into the culture medium. To determine the effect of pervanadate on cleavage secretion of gACE, pervanadate was added to the culture medium of ACE89 cells, and the enzyme activity of cleaved gACE in the culture medium was measured to quantitate secretion. As shown in Fig. 1A, ACE activity in the culture medium of pervanadate-treated cells increased more rapidly than that of the untreated cells. For example, after 30 min, ACE activity present in the culture medium of pervanadate-treated cells was 3-fold higher than that present in the medium of untreated cells (600 versus 200 units, respectively). The increased rate of secretion was detected as early as 5 min after the addition of pervanadate. To confirm this observation, biosynthesis and cleavage secretion of gACE was monitored by pulse chasing of newly synthesized gACE followed by immunoprecipitation of gACE from the cell extract and the culture medium. The effect of pervanadate on the cleavage secretion process was examined by its inclusion in the culture medium as described above. As expected, the 116-kDa mature gACE and its 95-kDa underglycosylated precursor were immunoprecipitated from the cell extract (Fig. 1B). The culture medium showed the presence of the 108-kDa mature cleaved gACE, indicating that gACE is secreted out at a low rate in unstimulated cells (8Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston W.I. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In pulse-chase experiments, cleavage secretion is expressed as the amount of secreted ACE in the medium as a percentage of total mature ACE in the cell extract and medium combined. The presence of pervanadate increased the rate of cleavage secretion from 13 ± 2% in unstimulated cells to 58 ± 5% in pervanadate-stimulated cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Taken together, these experiments confirmed that pervanadate significantly enhanced the cleavage secretion of gACE in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. A similar but less pronounced effect was observed when orthovanadate, a less potent inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, was used (data not shown). Phenylarsine oxide, a different tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, also increased cleavage secretion (Fig. 1D) in a similar fashion. We have shown previously that cleavage secretion of ACE is insensitive to the large number of inhibitors that are known to inhibit the cognate cell-bound protease activities, including several known inhibitors of metalloproteases (14Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Compound 3, a hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor, was the only compound that inhibited the constitutive cleavage secretion of gACE (14Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The last two lanes of Fig. 1, B and D, show that Compound 3, added simultaneously with pervanadate, inhibited completely the stimulatory effect of pervanadate or phenylarsine oxide on gACE cleavage secretion. These results indicate that similar metalloprotease(s) with a unique inhibitor profile is involved in the constitutive as well as pervanadate-stimulated cleavage secretion of ACE. ACE Present at the Cell Surface Is Cleaved by Pervanadate— Using immunocytochemistry, we have shown previously that ACE is expressed at the cell surface, which can be easily visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-ACE antibody and fluorescein-conjugated anti-IgG (18Santhamma K.R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23253-23258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Sadhukhan R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, similarly stained ACE89 cells were analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and revealed abundant ACE expression at the cell surface (Fig. 2A, filled peak in the upper panel). The observed fluorescence was specific for ACE, because without the addition of either the anti-ACE antibody (open peak) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (data not shown), much less fluorescence was recorded. After pervanadate treatment, the cells exhibited significantly less ACE on the cell surface, as evident by a shift to the left of fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2A, filled peak in the lower panel) compared with the fluorescence exhibited by the untreated cells (upper panel). These results indicated that ACE present at the surface of ACE89 cells was cleaved off by pervanadate treatment. To further confirm that pervanadate-induced cleavage occurs at the plasma membrane, we prevented the transport of ACE from the ER and Golgi apparatus, to the cell membrane, by treatment of cells with the drug Brefeldin A. Brefeldin A blocks Golgi functions by inducing resorption of the Golgi apparatus into the ER. When Brefeldin was present throughout the pulse-chase experiment, ACE synthesized under this condition was underglycosylated, as evidenced by its lower molecular weight (Fig. 2B, lane 9; compare with ACE in untreated cells, lane 3), and did not reach the cell surface, as evidenced by its resistance to cleavage by trypsin (data not shown) (see Ref. 17Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, neither constitutive (compare lanes 9 and 10 with lanes 3 and 4) nor pervanadate-stimulated (compare lanes 11 and 12 with lanes 5 and 6) cleavage of ACE was detectable (i.e. no ACE could be detected in the culture medium by immunoprecipitation or ACE activity measurements). If Brefeldin was added later in the experiment so that some of the synthesized ACE was already glycosylated and transported to the cell surface, the drug did not affect the cleavage secretion of preformed ACE (17Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 2B are consistent with the conclusion that pervanadate-stimulated cleavage of ACE occurs at the plasma membrane and not at internal membranes. In addition to direct cleavage and shedding at the cell surface, Gutwein et al. (23Gutwein P. Mechtersheimer S. Riedle S. Stoeck A. Gast D. Joumaa S. Zentgraf H. Fogel M. Altevogt D.P. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 292-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) showed that after pervanadate treatment, cells expressing the adhesion molecule L1 released full-length L1 in membrane vesicles along with a protease, and the cleavage occurred in the vesicles. To determine if such a mechanism is involved in pervanadate-induced shedding of ACE, we used two different strategies. Cell surface ACE was labeled with biotin at 4 °C, a temperature at which endocytosis is blocked, and its cleavage secretion was monitored at 16 °C, a temperature that blocks internalization of not all but many cell surface proteins (24Miserey-Lenkei S. Parnot C. Bardin S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5891-5901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Cao T.T. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, recycling of proteins was inhibited by monensin in another experiment, also performed at 16 °C. Biotin-labeled cell surface ACE, after pervanadate treatment, was quantitated by immunoprecipitation either with ACE antibody or with streptavidin-agarose, followed by Western analysis with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase or ACE antibody, respectively. Table I shows that, using either assay, pervanadate treatment increased cleavage secretion of biotinylated cell surface ACE. A similar increase in cleavage secretion was also observed when monensin-treated, cell surface-biotinylated ACE89 cells were incubated with pervanadate at 16 °C, a condition where endocytosis as well as recycling is absent or reduced substantially. Thus, it appears that enhanced shedding of ACE by pervanadate treatment occurs primarily by its cleavage at the cell surface.Table IPervanadate-induced cleavage of cell surface ACE does not involve endocytosis or recyclingTreatmentCleavage secretionIP: anti-ACE WB: streptavidinIP: streptavidin WB: anti-ACE%%None4549Pervanadate6772Monensin53Monensin and pervanadate62 Open table in a new tab Pervanadate Enhances Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ACE and Cellular Proteins That Co-purify with ACE—Since pervanadate is known to stabilize tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, its effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of ACE and ACE-associated proteins were determined. For this purpose, ACE89 cells were metabolically labeled, and ACE, with the cellular proteins bound to it, was isolated from detergent extracts of ACE89 cells. This was accomplished either by binding to an affinity resin consisting of lisinopril, a competitive inhibitor of ACE, or by immunoprecipitation with ACE antibody. After extensive washing, the proteins bound to the affinity column or present in the immunoprecipitate were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE (18Santhamma K.R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23253-23258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were then Western blotted using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Several distinct tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were eluted from the lisinopril column when the extract was prepared from pervanadate-treated ACE89 cells (Fig. 3, lane 2). The same tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were also eluted from the ACE antibody immunoprecipitate (lane 6). For lane 7, the immunoprecipitate was prepared from detergent extract of isolated membrane fraction instead of whole cells. None of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins could be detected when untreated cells were used (lanes 1 and 5), ind"

Transducer binding converts the proton pumps to signal-relay devices in which the transport is inhibited. In sensory rhodopsin I (SRI) binding of its cognate transducer HtrI inhibits transport by closing a cytoplasmic proton-conducting channel necessary for proton uptake during the SRI photochemical reaction cycle. To investigate the channel closure, a series of HtrI mutants truncated in the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic portion of an SRI-HtrI fusion were constructed and expressed in H. salinarum membranes. We found that binding of the membrane-embedded portion of HtrI is insufficient for channel closure, whereas cytoplasmic extension of the second HtrI transmembrane helix by 13 residues blocks proton conduction through the channel as well as full-length HtrI. Specifically the closure activity is localized in this 13-residue membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain to the 5 final residues, each of which incrementally contributes to reduction of proton conductivity. Moreover, these same residues in the dark incrementally and proportionally increase the pKa of the Asp-76 counterion to the protonated Schiff base chromophore in the membrane-embedded photoactive site. We conclude that this critical region of HtrI alters the dark conformation of SRI as well as light-induced channel opening. The 5 residues in HtrI correspond in position to 5 residues demonstrated on the homologous NpHtrII to interact with the E-F loop of its cognate receptor NpSRII in the accompanying article (Yang, C.-S., Sineshchekov, O., Spudich, E.

Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and site-directed spin labeling (17Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) provide compelling evidence that a similar conformational change opens cytoplasmic proton-conducting channels in transducer-free SRs during their photocycles. Transducer binding inhibits the light-induced cytoplasmic side proton-conductivity increase and therefore either prevents the channel opening or blocks the channels (7Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K.

Channel closure by the transducers appears to be a key part of the mechanism for converting SRs from proton pumps to sensory receptors (21Spudich J.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 747-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and understanding its structural basis is expected to provide insight into the SR-Htr signal-relay mechanism. A 114-residue N-terminal Natronomonas pharaonis HtrII (NpHtrII) fragment containing the transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) and a 32-residue extension of TM2 into the cytoplasm (the “membrane-proximal domain”) closes the channel of NpSRII in a micellar system and in Xenopus oocytes (22Hippler-Mreyen S. Klare J.P. Wegener A.A. Seidel R. Herrmann C. Schmies G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Engelhard M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). X-ray structures of NpSRII are available both for the free receptor (13Luecke H. Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Royant A. Nollert P. Edman K. Neutze R. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Navarro J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Buldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The atomic structures of NpSRII in the transducer-free form and in the NpSRII·NpHtrII-(1–114) complex are essentially identical and therefore the mechanism of the channel closure is not evident from comparison of their dark structures. The structure of the interacting transmembrane domain of NpHtrII was refined at atomic resolution in the complex, and reveals that the membrane-embedded portions of helices F and G of NpSRII interact with TM1 and TM2, but the cytoplasmic portion of NpHtrII is unresolved in the structure of the complex. Therefore it is not clear from the crystallographic data whether the membrane-proximal domain of NpHtrII interacts with NpSRII and whether such a physical interaction might be responsible for inhibiting the channel activity. C-terminal deletion analysis showed that the N-terminal 147 residues of HtrI (full-length HtrI contains 536 residues) are sufficient to close the channel of SRI in the native H. salinarum membrane (24Perazzona B. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6475-6478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Shorter fragments either were not expressed well and/or folded improperly in the H. salinarum cell. Our main goal in the present study was to test more precisely which portions of HtrI are needed for channel closure and to determine whether specific residues are needed. We took advantage of our finding that a SRI-HtrI fusion protein is fully functional in phototaxis and exhibits photochemical reactions indistinguishable from those of the wild-type SRI-HtrI complex (25Chen X. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3891-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and that shortening the HtrI domain of the fusion proteins, even including complete removal of the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic portion, does not destabilize the fusion proteins, which could be expressed at high levels suitable for characterization in native cell membranes (results herein). Strains and Plasmids—Wild-type SRI-HtrI complex was expressed from its native promoter in plasmid pKJ306 (26Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HtrI-free SRI and SRI-HtrI full-length fusion were expressed under the bop promoter in plasmids pTR2 and pXP6, respectively (18Olson K.D. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2578-2585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Chen X. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3891-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plasmid pXP6 was constructed by recombinant PCR using a 9-residue flexible linker (25Chen X. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3891-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to connect the C terminus of SRI and the N terminus of HtrI. Using pXP6 as template, the C-terminal truncated mutants of SRI-HtrI fusion, SRI-linker fusion, and SRI-HtrI-(54–66) were generated by PCR with specific primers containing AgeI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites. The PCR fragments replaced the AgeI and XbaI fragment of pXP6. Recombinant PCR was used to construct the SRI-HtrII fusion with the same method as that used for the SRI-HtrI fusion (25Chen X. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3891-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SRI-HtrII-(1–302)-HtrI-(54–66) was constructed by PCR using SRI-HtrII fusion as template. All the single residue mutations were introduced by the two-step mega-primer PCR method with pfu polymerase (28Chen B. Przybyla A.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar). H. salinarum strain Pho81Wr- (BR-HR-SRI-HtrI-SRII-HtrII- and restriction-deficient) (29Yao V.J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6931-6935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the recipient in plasmid transformations. Membrane Preparation—Membranes were prepared by sonication of cells grown as described (30Bogomolni R.A. Spudich J.L. Robb F.T. Place A.R. Sowers K.R. Schreier H.J. DasSarma S. Fleischmann E.M. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 63-73Google Scholar) to stationary phase in complex medium containing 1 μg/ml mevinolin. Membranes were pelleted for 1 h at 237,000 × g in a Beckman Optima™ L-100 XP ultracentrifuge and suspended in 4 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) at ∼10 mg of protein/ml in the final step of the procedure. Immunoblot Analysis—5 μl of membrane suspension was added to 195 μl of SDS loading buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before separation by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 4 °C overnight and detected by anti-SRI antibody. Immunoblots were developed using the ECL Western blotting kit. Flash Photolysis—Flash-induced absorption changes were measured by a laboratory constructed cross-beam spectrometer with a frequency double Nd-YAG laser (532 nm, 6-ns pulse, 40 mJ) providing the actinic flash. The flashing frequency was 0.08 Hz. A total of 12–36 transients were averaged for each trace at a constant temperature of 21 °C. pH Titration—The pH of the pigment suspension was measured with a Beckman Φ72 pH meter after sodium hydroxide solution was added in microliter quantities to the cuvette. Absorption difference spectra were recorded with a Cary 4000 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Analytical Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA). The change in absorption of the suspension at 650 nm was used as a quantitative measure of the blue-purple transition, from spectra adjusted for baseline drift by fixing the value at 750 nm, at which neither the blue nor purple SRI absorbs. Care was taken to accept only data sets in which the isosbestic point for the blue/purple transition was maintained throughout the titration. All samples were in 4 m NaCl. Fits to the titration data were performed in Origin 7.0 from Originlab (North Hampton, MA). Motion Analysis—Motility responses to SRI photoactivation were assayed by computer-assisted cell tracking and motion analysis as described (26Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Swimming cells were subjected to a 4-s step-down in 600 ± 20 nm light to test attractant signaling, and a 100-ms step-up in 380–600 nm light to test repellent signaling. The Membrane-proximal Domain of HtrI Is Required to Close the Cytoplasmic Channel of SRI—HtrI-free SRI has a similar proton pumping activity as BR, releasing a proton to the extracellular side from the protonated Schiff base in the photoactive site and in the second half of the photocycle taking up a proton through the cytoplasmic channel of the molecule (6Bogomolni R.A. Stoeckenius W. Szundi I. Perozo E. Olson K.D. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10188-10192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The photocycle kinetics of free SRI is rate-limited by return of the proton to the SRI photoactive site, and therefore is strongly pH-dependent for the open channel SRI (19Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16095-16097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proton return is readily monitored as the decay of the unprotonated Schiff base photocycle intermediate (called “M” or S373, λmax 373 nm) to the far red-shifted Schiff base-protonated state with absorption maximum at either 587 or 552 nm (depending on whether Asp-76 near the Schiff base is neutral or ionized, respectively). The pH dependence of the decay of M, which kinetically matches the return of the unphotolyzed state (25Chen X. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3891-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in HtrI-free SRI under the conditions in this study was found to exhibit a slope of 1.0 in the range of pH between 5.0 and 7.5 (Fig. 1); i.e. the rate of Schiff base reprotonation is directly proportional to the proton concentration of the medium. In the HtrI-complexed SRI the proton is not exchanged with the medium (18Olson K.D. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2578-2585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and therefore the reprotonation of the Schiff base is relatively insensitive to external proton concentration (19Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16095-16097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decay of M exhibits a slight acceleration with higher pH and the slope of the log of the M decay half-time versus proton pH is slightly negative (about -0.07) when the channel is closed (Fig. 1). The pH dependence of the photocycle rate therefore provides a robust quantitative measure of the extent of channel closure. To test whether the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of HtrI closes the channel, a series of truncation mutants of SRI-HtrI fusion were constructed (Fig. 2) and expressed in H. salinarum membranes. Membrane suspensions of these mutants immunoblotted with anti-SRI antibody showed that all of the fusions are intact in the membrane, with no detectable proteolytic bands (Fig. 3). All the fusions were expressed under the control of the bop promoter and have higher yields than that of SRI expressed under the native promoter in the htrI-sopI operon. The SRI-HtrI fragment fusions all have similar expression yields (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Immunoblot analysis of membranes containing wild-type SRI, truncated SRI-HtrI fusion, SRI-linker, SRI-HtrI fusion, and SRI-HtrII fusion. Membrane suspensions were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-SRI antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The photocycles of SRI-HtrI-(1–53) and SRI-HtrI-(1–61) exhibit pH dependence similar to that of free SRI but with the slopes reproducibly decreased by ∼10% (slopes 0.88 and 0.86, respectively; Fig. 4). SRI-HtrI-(1–72), SRI-HtrI-(1–85), and SRI-HtrI-(1–147) exhibit a small negative pH dependence identical to that of full-length SRI-HtrI complex (Fig. 4). We conclude that the N-terminal 61 residues of HtrI are not sufficient to close the channel, whereas the N-terminal 72 residues of HtrI are sufficient to close the channel just as effectively as longer HtrI fragments. SRI-HtrI-(1–53) is predicted to contain the two transmembrane segments of the transducer but no cytoplasmic extension (Fig. 2) based on aligning HtrI with NpHtrII for which the membrane-embedded portion is known from the crystal structure (23Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Buldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The small decrease in the slope in SRI-HtrI-(1–53) argues that the transmembrane portion alone of HtrI binds to SRI but does not significantly close the channel. Also the pH dependence shifts ∼1 unit to higher pH (compare Figs. 1 and 4). To exclude that the 9-residue linker, which connects the C terminus of SRI and N terminus of HtrI, is responsible for this small decrease and pH shift, we constructed an SRI-linker fusion without an HtrI fragment, which showed a pH dependence identical to that of free SRI. To further confirm that the photocycle change of SRI-HtrI-(1–53) derives from the specific interaction between the SRI receptor and the transmembrane portion of HtrI, an SRI-HtrII fusion was constructed. HtrII, the cognate transducer for sensory rhodopsin II (SRII), does not function with SRI (31Zhang X.N. Zhu J. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This fusion also exhibited the same pH dependence as free SRI. HtrI binding increases the single-flash yield of M in the SRI photocycle because the transducer suppresses thermal branching reactions from S610 (K) and S560 (L) states to the unphotolyzed state (32Spudich J.L. Zacks D.N. Bogomolni R.A. Isr. J. Photochem. 1995; 35: 495-513Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The flash yield of SRI-HtrI-(1–53) is intermediate between that of free and HtrI-complexed SRI (Fig. 5), confirming again that the transmembrane domain of HtrI alone exhibits some interaction with the SRI receptor. Fine Mapping of the HtrI Channel Closure Activity in the Membrane-proximal Domain—Extending the cytoplasmic domain by 8 residues (SRI-HtrI-(1–61)) did not increase channel closure, whereas extending it by 19 (SRI-HtrI-(1–72)) is sufficient for the full channel closure effect. To examine this region in finer detail, we made truncated fusion mutants at each residue between positions 61 and 72 of HtrI. Partial closure of the channel is observed for lengths of the transducer up to SRI-HtrI-(1–66), which is the shortest that exhibits a pH dependence slope indistinguishable from that of full-length HtrI (Fig. 6). Therefore the N-terminal 66 residues of HtrI, containing TM1, TM2, and the first 13 cytoplasmic amino acids, are sufficient to close the channel. The 5 residues from 62 through 66 in HtrI contribute most to the channel closure of SRI. Channel Closure by the Membrane-proximal Domain Requires the Membrane-embedded Domain of HtrI—To test whether the cytoplasmic 13-residue stretch itself can close the channel of SRI without the specific interaction between the transmembrane domains of HtrI and the receptor, two fusions were constructed: first, SRI was fused to this 13-residue stretch with the same linker (SRI-HtrI-(54–66)), and second, the 13 residues were substituted into the cytoplasmic portion of HtrII in the SRI-HtrII fusion (SRI-HtrII-(1–302)-HtrI-(54–66)). The photocycle kinetics of both fusions exhibit the same pH-dependent photocycles as HtrI-free SRI. Our interpretation is that the presence of the 13-residue stretch itself is not sufficient to block the channel, but requires specific interactions between the SRI receptor and HtrI transducer in the membrane domain. The pKaof Asp-76 in the SRI Incrementally Increases in a Manner Correlated with the Closure of the Cytoplasmic Channel of SRI—SRI exhibits a blue-purple transition at alkaline pH, caused by the deprotonation of Asp-76 of SRI. In the blue species (λmax 587 nm) Asp-76 is protonated, and in the purple species (λmax 552) Asp-76 is unprotonated. In HtrI-free SRI, the pKa of Asp-76 is 7.2–7.4 (6Bogomolni R.A. Stoeckenius W. Szundi I. Perozo E. Olson K.D. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10188-10192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Haupts U. Haupts C. Oesterhelt D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3834-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Binding of full-length HtrI, in addition to blocking the SRI cytoplasmic channel, increases this pKa of Asp-76 to 8.6–8.9 (25Chen X. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3891-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The different absorption maxima among the truncation mutants of SRI-HtrI fusion at pH 7.5 show an incremental increase of the pKa correlated with the incremental closure of the channel. The pH titration of the purple-blue transition of SRI-HtrI-(1–53) yields a pKa of 7.8 (with free SRI showing a pKa of 7.3), further confirming that the membrane portion of HtrI itself, which only slightly closes the channel, interacts with the SRI receptor. Extension of the cytoplasmic portion of HtrI in the fusion mutants further incrementally increases the pKa of Asp-76 to 8.6 at position 66 at HtrI, closely correlating with the complete blocking of the channel (Fig. 7). The Effects of Mutations in the 5-Residue Region on the Phototaxis Response—To test whether the 5 residues most effective in channel closure (62–66 in HtrI) are also functionally important for phototaxis, Ala residues were introduced into each of the first 3 positions (K62A, E63A, and I64A) and Ser residues into each of the final 2 positions (A65S and A66S) in the HtrI portion of the SRI-HtrI full-length fusion. Photocycle kinetics of these mutants exhibited a small negative pH dependence indistinguishable from that of the wild type SRI-HtrI complex, indicating that the channel closure effect depends on the presence of residues at these positions but does not depend on their specific type. We assessed swimming behavior responses to 1-photon stimulation with orange light (600 ± 20 nm), which induce attractant responses in cells expressing the wild-type SRI-HtrI full-length fusion, and to 2-photon stimulation to white light (380–600 nm), which induce repellent responses. Both responses were completely eliminated by the mutation I64A in the HtrI portion of the SRI-HtrI full-length fusion (data not shown). The other 4 position mutants exhibited wild-type attractant and repellent responses to saturating stimuli. Residue Ile-64, in the middle of the 5 channel closing positions, is therefore singularly critical for signaling. The results above show that (i) 13 residues extending into the cytoplasm from the second transmembrane helix (TM2) of HtrI are sufficient for closure of the cytoplasmic channel opened in transducer-free SRI during its photocycle. This is a much shorter region than the 94 cytoplasmic residues found sufficient in a previous study (24Perazzona B. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6475-6478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the key advantage here being the use of SRI-HtrI fusions that allowed much shorter HtrI fragments to be stabilized. (ii) The final 5 residues (62–66) are nearly completely responsible for the closure effect, and (iii) channel closure by this membrane-proximal domain requires the membrane-embedded domain of HtrI, which alone interacts with SRI altering to a small extent its properties, but without significantly closing the channel. (iv) The same membrane-proximal HtrI residues raise the pKa of Asp-76, a buried residue far from the cytoplasmic loops of the SRI protein predicted to be near the HtrI membrane-proximal domain. It is therefore clear that the SRI dark conformation is altered by the presence of the position 62–66 residues in HtrI. The correlation of the effects of HtrI on the Asp-76 pKa and channel conductivity during the photocycle suggests a model based on two SRI dark conformations in equilibrium: one with a low Asp-76 pKa able to open the cytoplasmic channel during the photocycle and the other with a high Asp-76 pKa in which this opening (or more accurately the associated proton-conductivity increase) is suppressed. In terms of this two-conformation description, the 5-residue region stabilizes the second conformation, with incremental increases in the equilibrium shift occurring with incremental lengthening of the HtrI fragment from 61 to 66 residues. What is the mechanism by which residues 62–66 alter the SRI conformation? One mechanism would be direct interaction of these residues with the cytoplasmic region of SRI, in particular with the E-F loop of SRI. According to modeling the SRI-HtrI complex on the structure of the related NpSRII-NpHtrII complex, the SRI E-F loop would be at approximately the same distance from the membrane as the 5-residue region in the cytoplasmic extension of HtrI. A direct interaction model is favored by the demonstration of close proximity between the NpSRII E-F loop and the membrane-proximal domain of its transducer NpHtrII as described in the accompanying article (33Yang C.-S. Sineshchekov O. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42970-42976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by sulfhydryl cross-linking, probe accessibility measurements, and FRET. In that study, 5 residues in NpHtrII were found to be within energy-transferring distances from a fluorescent probe positioned on S154C on the NpSRII E-F loop. Most strikingly, in alignments of HtrI and NpHtrII, these 5 residues (91–95) in NpHtrII correspond to residues 62–66 in HtrI. Residues 62, 65, and 66 are almost entirely responsible for the channel closure, consistent with a helical turn in which they contact SRI, and in which residues 63 and 64 would be facing away from the interaction region. Residue 64 is shown here to be critical for phototaxis signaling, perhaps because of its involvement in HtrI homodimer interaction in this region (34Zhang X.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19722-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude the distinctly different mechanism that the structure in the membrane-embedded portion of the HtrI-SRI interface could be altered by the cytoplasmic extension, and hence a conformational equilibrium of SRI between partially interacting (open channel) and fully interacting (closed channel) forms is shifted incrementally by extending the cytoplasmic domain. Such a mechanism would require assuming that the relatively small differences in helical length between SRI-HtrI-(1–61) through SRI-HtrI-(1–66) would cause a significant alteration in the transmembrane structure of HtrI. This interpretation would be consistent with the observation that shortening of NpHtrII from 114 to 101 residues eliminates binding of NpHtrII truncation mutants to NpSRII in detergent micelles (22Hippler-Mreyen S. Klare J.P. Wegener A.A. Seidel R. Herrmann C. Schmies G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Engelhard M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), although this phenomenon may be because of non-native folding by the shorter truncated NpHtrII. Considering all of these points we favor the direct interaction model as explaining the results most simply. The membrane-proximal domains of HtrI and HtrII are predicted to be HAMP domains, which consist of two helical amphipathic sequences (AS-1 and AS-2) connected by a connector of undefined structure, which is observed in most methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins and in sensor kinases in bacteria (35Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Williams S.B. Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The membrane-proximal region of HtrI required for channel closure of SRI identified in this study belong to the AS-1 region of the HAMP domain. Mutations in HAMP domains of Tsr, Tar, NarX, EnvZ, and HtrI result in biased signal transduction causing constitutive or inverted signaling (26Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ames P. Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 817-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Collins L.A. Egan S.M. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Appleman J.A. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Park H. Inouye M.

Most interestingly, all suppressor mutations to SRI inverted signaling mutants found in HtrI are located in this region (26Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small but readily detected effects of the HtrI-(1–53) fragment, which does not contain a cytoplasmic extension, on SRI properties demonstrates that the membrane-embedded portion of HtrI binds to SRI, as would be expected from the crystallographically demonstrated interaction of NpSRII and NpHtrII (23Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Buldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that this membrane interaction is necessary for the cytoplasmic membrane-proximal domain to close the channel in SRI. In BR, the main conformational change induced by light is the tilting of helices, especially helix F, which opens its cytoplasmic proton-conducting channel. Cryoelectron crystallography of BR reveals that the greatest movement of BR induced by light is in the cytoplasmic portion of helix F and the E-F loop (16Subramaniam S. Henderson R. Nature. 2000; 406: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Hence the interaction of SRI and HtrI within the membrane may function to hold the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain in the proper orientation to detect the similar SRI motion in the cytoplasmic portion of helix F and the E-F loop. In this view the signal transfer from SRI to HtrI would occur in the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of the complex. Hence transmembrane signaling, such as occurs in chemotaxis receptors (42Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2056841860,"Tissue factor (TF) is an integral membrane protein cofactor for factor VIIa (fVIIa) that initiates the blood coagulation cascade during vascular injury. TF has two fibrinonectin type III-like domains, both of which make extensive interactions with both the light and heavy chains of fVIIa. In addition to interaction with fVIIa, the membrane proximal C-terminal domain of TF is also known to bind the natural substrates factors IX and X, thereby facilitating their assembly and recognition by fVIIa in the activation complex. Both fVIIa and TF are elongated proteins, and their complex appears to be positioned nearly perpendicular to the membrane surface. It is possible that, similar to fVIIa, the N-terminal domain of TF also contacts the natural substrates. To investigate this possibility, we substituted all 23 basic and acidic residues of the N-terminal domain of TF with Ala or Asn and expressed the mutants as soluble TF2-219 in a novel expression/purification vector system in the periplasmic space of bacteria. Following purification to homogeneity, the cofactor properties of mutants in promoting the amidolytic and proteolytic activity of fVIIa were analyzed in appropriate kinetic assays. The amidolytic activity assays indicated that several charged residues spatially clustered at the junction of the N- and C-terminal domains of TF are required for high affinity interaction with fVIIa. On the other hand, the proteolytic activity assays revealed that none of the residues under study may be an interactive site for either factor IX or factor X. However, it was discovered the Arg74 mutant of TF was defective in enhancing both the amidolytic and proteolytic activity of fVIIa, suggesting that this residue may be required for the allosteric activation of the protease.

The structure of TF is composed of two fibrinonectin type III-like extracellular domains, a single membrane-spanning domain and a short cytoplasmic tail (4Harlos K. Martin D.M.A. O'Brien D.P.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10864-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although all three domains of TF are required for the physiological function of the cofactor, previous studies have indicated that the two extracellular domains expressed by recombinant DNA methods as a soluble protein (sTF) can bind to fVIIa with a high affinity to enhance both the amidolytic and proteolytic activities of the protease (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Ruf W. Schullek J.R. Stone M.J. Edgington T.S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7380-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of sTF either alone or in complex with fVIIa has been determined (4Harlos K. Martin D.M.A. O'Brien D.P. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Polikarpov I. Miller A. Tuddnham E.G.D. Boys C.W.G. Nature. 1994; 370: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchofer A. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The structural data have indicated that the extracellular domains of TF make extensive interactions with both the light and heavy chains of fVIIa (10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchofer A. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). It is believed that these interactions allosterically change the conformation of the active-site pocket of fVIIa, leading to a dramatic improvement in the catalytic efficiency of the protease toward both synthetic and natural macromolecular substrates (1Morrissey J.H. Neuenschwander P.F. Huang Q. McCallum C.D. Bixia S. Johnson A.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Most of the functionally critical residues of TF have been mapped by the Ala-scanning mutagenesis approaches (7Ruf W. Schullek J.R. Stone M.J. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Kirchofer D. Lipari M.T. Moran P Eigenbrot C. Kelley R.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21752-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The characterization of these mutants has indicated that, in addition to interaction with fVIIa, the C-terminal membrane proximal domain of TF also provides binding sites for the γ-carboxyglutamic acid and/or the first epidermal growth factor-like domains of factors IX and X thereby facilitating the assembly and optimal recognition of these substrates by fVIIa in the activation complex (11Huang Q. Neuenschwander P.F. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21752-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6375-6381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been demonstrated that the interaction of the γ-carboxyglutamic acid domains of both substrates with the two basic residues Lys165 and Lys166 in the membrane proximal C-terminal domain of TF makes a significant contribution to the specificity of the zymogen activation by fVIIa (11Huang Q. Neuenschwander P.F. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21752-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The structural and fluorescence energy transfer studies data have further indicated that the binding of TF to fVIIa stabilizes the protease in a topological orientation in which the active site pocket of fVIIa is maintained far above the membrane surface in the activation complex (10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchofer A. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 13McCallum C.D. Su B. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30160-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, for effective activation by fVIIa, both factors IX and X are also required to assemble into the activation complex in a similar extended conformation to maintain the activation peptide of the substrates at the same distance above the membrane surface. Noting that several charged residues of the N-terminal domain of TF make extensive interactions with the protease domain of fVIIa, we hypothesized that these residues may also interact with the protease domains of the substrates in the activation complexes. To test this hypothesis, we substituted all 23 basic and acidic residues of the TF N-terminal domain with Ala and expressed the mutant constructs in soluble sTF2-219 forms in a newly developed expression/purification vector system in the periplasmic space of bacteria. The Ala substitution mutants of two constructs (Glu56 and Asp58) were not expressed to a high yield, thus these residues were substituted with Asn. All of the mutants were purified to homogeneity and characterized with respect to their ability to function as cofactors to enhance the amidolytic and proteolytic activities of fVIIa using standard kinetic assays. The results of the amidolytic activity assays indicated that a number of basic and acidic residues of the N-terminal domain, centered spatially on the middle section of the cofactor near its junction with the C-terminal domain, are required for the high affinity interaction of the cofactor with fVIIa. This finding is consistent with previous similar mutagenesis studies (7Ruf W. Schullek J.R. Stone M.J. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, detailed kinetic analysis in the presence of saturating concentrations of the sTF2-219 mutants suggested that the N-terminal domain of the cofactor may have no interactive site for either factor IX or factor X in the related activation complexes. However, we identified Arg74 as a unique residue that is required for the catalytic function of fVIIa in reaction with both synthetic and macromolecular substrates. The mutagenesis of Arg74 markedly impaired both the amidolytic and proteolytic functions of fVIIa, suggesting that this residue may be required for the allosteric activation of the catalytic pocket of the protease. Construction, Mutagenesis, and Expression of Soluble Tissue Factor in Bacteria—Construction and expression of soluble TF lacking both the trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domains (sTF2-219) in the pINIII-pelB bacterial periplasmic expression/purification vector system has been described previously (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To improve the expression yield of sTF, this vector was modified by inserting a promoterless neomycin cDNA lacking the Shine-Dalgarno sequence immediately downstream of the sTF2-219 stop codon. This construction strategy translationally coupled the expression of the neomycin cDNA to that of sTF. To facilitate purification, the 12-residue epitope for the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody, HPC4, was also linked in-frame to the pelB signal peptide as described previously (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The Ala substitution mutants of sTF2-219 were prepared by PCR mutagenesis methods in the same vector system as described previously (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After confirmation of the accuracy of the mutagenesis by DNA sequencing, the mutant constructs were transformed into the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli and selection was carried out in kanamycin as described previously (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bacterial colonies harboring the wild-type and mutant sTF2-219 derivatives were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin in 1-liter flasks at 37 °C to a cell density of A600 = 0.6-1.0 and then were induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The incubation was continued overnight (∼12 h) at room temperature (∼25 °C). The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min, and the periplasmic extract was prepared by hypotonic shock of bacterial pellet in 100 ml of H2O for 30 min and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant and the periplasmic extract were mixed and supplemented with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm benzamidine, 0.02% NaN3, and 5 mm CaCl2 and chromatographed on the HPC4 monoclonal antibody immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) as described previously (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The sTF2-219 concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm assuming a molecular weight of 27,000 and extinction coefficient ( E1cm1%) of 14.8 and by an amidolytic activity assay as described previously (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Human plasma proteins including factors VIIa, IX, IXa, X, and Xa were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described previously (14Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrates Spectrozyme VIIa (CH3SO2-d-CHA-But-Arg-p-nitroanilide) and Spectrozyme FXa (MeO-CO-d-CHG-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide) were purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), and CBS 31.39 (CH3SO2-d-Leu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide) was purchased from Midwest Bio-Tech Inc. (Fisher). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from Gold Bio Technology Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Evaluation of the Kd(app) Values—The affinity of the sTF2-219 mutants for binding to fVIIa was evaluated based on their ability to enhance the catalytic activity of fVIIa toward cleavage of Spectrozyme VIIa. Increasing concentrations of the cofactor (0.78-100 nm for wild-type and up to 12 μm for the mutants) were incubated with fVIIa (5 nm) in 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 5 mm CaCl2 (TBS/Ca2+) in 96-well assay plates. After 1 min of incubation at room temperature, Spectrozyme VIIa was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and the rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm on a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The background activity of fVIIa in the absence of sTF2-219 was subtracted from the measured values. The maximal activity and Kd(app) values were calculated from the non-linear curve fitting of amidolytic activity data to the Langmuir isotherm and/or the quadratic binding equation as described previously (15Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Factor X Activation—The steady-state kinetics of factor X activation by fVIIa in complex with wild-type or mutant sTF2-219 derivatives were studied in TBS/Ca2+ at room temperature as described previously (16Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of product (factor Xa) was monitored by a two-stage discontinuous assay. In the first stage, fVIIa (0.3 nm), PC/PS vesicles (0.3 mm), and saturating concentrations of sTF2-219 mutants (at least 10× Kd(app) values) were incubated for 10 min in 96-well assay plates and the reactions then were initiated by adding increasing concentrations of factor X (20-2630 nm). After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the reactions were terminated by adding 50 mm EDTA. In the second stage, the amidolytic activity of each sample was determined by the subsequent addition of Spectrozyme FXa (a final concentration of 0.1 mm). The absorbance at 405 nm was monitored over 5 min using a Vmax kinetic microplate reader, and the initial rates of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis (ΔA405/min) were converted to the nanomolar of product by reference to a standard curve prepared with purified human factor Xa. The apparent Km and kcat values for substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the catalytic efficiencies were expressed as the ratio of kcat/Km. Factor IX Activation—Steady-state kinetics of factor IX activation by fVIIa in complex with wild-type and mutant sTF2-219 derivatives was performed by the same methods described above for factor X. fVIIa (5 nm), PC/PS vesicles (0.3 mm), and saturating concentrations of sTF2-219 mutants (at least 10× Kd(app) values) were incubated for 10 min, and the reactions then were initiated by adding increasing concentrations of factor IX (27-3510 nm). After 50 min of activation at an ambient temperature, the reactions were terminated by adding 50 mm EDTA. The rate of factor IXa generation was determined by an amidolytic activity assay using CBS 31.39 containing 33% ethylene glycol as described previously (17Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The initial rates of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis (ΔA405/min) were converted to nanomolar of product by reference to a standard curve prepared with purified human factor IXa. The apparent Km and kcat values for substrate hydrolysis were calculated as described above. Competitive Binding Studies—The competitive effect of the Arg74 to Ala mutant of sTF2-219, exhibiting impaired cofactor activity toward macromolecular substrates, on factor X activation by the wild-type fVIIa·sTF2-219 complex was studied. In this case, the activation of factor X (500 nm) by a limiting fixed concentration of fVIIa (2 nm) in complex with PC/PS vesicles (100 μg/ml) and 100 nm sTF2-219 was monitored in TBS/Ca2+ in the presence of increasing concentrations the sTF2-219 mutant (0.156-10 μm). Following incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the reactions were terminated by adding 50 mm EDTA and the rate of factor Xa generation was determined as described above. Expression and Purification of sTF2-219 Derivatives—All of the sTF2-219 derivatives were expressed in the periplasmic space of bacteria using the pINIII-pelB-neomycin expression/purification vector system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This vector system, which incorporates a 12-residues epitope for the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4 to the N-terminal of the expressed protein, is an improved version of pINIII-pelB, which we previously used to express and purify sTF2-219 from bacterial culture (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the current study, we inserted a promoterless neomycin cDNA immediately downstream from the sTF2-219 stop codon. This strategy improved the expression yield to greater than 20 mg/liter sTF2-219. Wild-type and mutant proteins were separated from the bacterial culture supernatants and periplasmic extracts by a single step immuno-affinity chromatography on immobilized HPC4 as described previously (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). With the exception of Glu56 and Asp58, all of the basic and acidic residues of the N-terminal domain of sTF2-219 were substituted with Ala in individual constructs. The Ala substitution mutants of both Glu56 and Asp58 did not express to high yield; thus, these residues were substituted with Asn. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins under non-reducing conditions indicated that the isolated proteins were essentially homogenous (Fig. 1). We previously demonstrated that the bacterial sTF2-219 with or without an N-terminal HPC4 epitope exhibits identical cofactor activity as the mammalian sTF1-219 (6Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, the cofactor activities of all of the sTF2-219 derivatives were evaluated without cleaving the HPC4 epitope from the N termini of the recombinant proteins. Evaluation of the Kd(app) of sTF2-219Mutants for Binding to fVIIa—TF is known to enhance the amidolytic activity of fVIIa toward tripeptidyl chromogenic substrates 30-100-fold (1Morrissey J.H. Neuenschwander P.F. Huang Q. McCallum C.D. Bixia S. Johnson A.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This property of the cofactor was utilized to evaluate the affinity of sTF2-219 derivatives for binding to fVIIa. In agreement with previous results, wild-type sTF2-219 interacted with fVIIa with a Kd(app) of 5.3 nm (Table I). On the basis of their importance for interaction with fVIIa and improving the catalytic efficiency of the protease, the sTF2-219 mutants can be functionally classified into three general categories: 1) mutants with impaired affinity but with normal cofactor activity; 2) mutants with both impaired affinity and cofactor activity; and 3) mutants with improved cofactor activity. Among the first class, at least five mutants (Lys20, Glu24, Asp44, Lys48, and Asp58) exhibited the greatest loss of affinity for fVIIa, suggesting that these residues play a critical role either directly or indirectly in interaction with fVIIa (Table I). However, at saturating concentrations of the mutant cofactors, fVIIa exhibited nearly similar maximal amidolytic activity. It should be noted that, with the D58N mutant, no Kd(app) could be measured because the amidolytic activity of fVIIa in the presence of the mutant cofactor remained linear for up to 12 μm sTF2-219 mutant. Thus, the results with this mutant cannot be analyzed with certainty. The functionally important residues of the TF N-terminal domain were found to be spatially clustered at the junction of the N- and C-terminal domains of TF (Fig. 2). Mutagenesis of these residues and the use of synthetic peptides based on this region have been reported to dramatically impair the cofactor activity of fVIIa (7Ruf W. Schullek J.R. Stone M.J. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Gibbs C.S. McCurdy S.N. Leung L.L. Paborsky L.R.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15328-15333Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) Results of this study suggest that fVIIa has a normal amidolytic activity in the presence of saturating concentrations of these sTF2-219 mutants, suggesting that the catalytic defect with these mutants is solely due to their loss of interaction with the protease. In the case of Asp58, substitution with Asn dramatically reduced the affinity of sTF for fVIIa. Interestingly, when Lee and Kelley (21Lee G.F. Kelley R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4149-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) used phage-display technology to create an altered version of sTF that retained wild-type binding affinity for fVIIa but which failed to enhance the proteolytic activity of fVIIa, they found that their mutants contained exclusively a substitution of Trp for Asp at position 58 of sTF.Table IThe sTF2-219-mediated improvement in the amidolytic activity of fVIIasTFMaximal velocityKd(app)mOD/minnmWT7.3 ± 0.45.3 ± 1.5K15A7.1 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.8K20A8.5 ± 0.11268 ± 60E24A7.3 ± 0.444.3 ± 5.7E26A9.3 ± 0.313.0 ± 1.7K28A6.9 ± 0.58.8 ± 2.0K41A7.7 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.5D44A6.4 ± 0.1267 ± 61K46A7.9 ± 0.520.9 ± 2.3K48A7.6 ± 0.288.5 ± 9.5D54A9.7 ± 0.14.1 ± 0.9E56N9.8 ± 0.326.3 ± 3.5D58NND>12,000D61A11.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.2E62A11.0 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.4K65A8.8 ± 0.42.9 ± 0.3D66A8.9 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.2K68A13.1 ± 0.39.1 ± 1.4R74A3.1 ± 0.2950 ± 150E84A8.8 ± 0.16.2 ± 0.3E91A8.3 ± 0.278.0 ± 3.9E95A2.9 ± 0.610.3 ± 0.2E99A7.6 ± 0.810.0 ± 0.2E105A5.8 ± 1.37.9 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab In the second class of mutants, we identified a new functionally important residue, Arg74, which was not included in the previous Ala-scanning mutagenesis study of TF (7Ruf W. Schullek J.R. Stone M.J. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis of this residue resulted in both impaired affinity and cofactor activity for the sTF2-219 mutant. As shown in Table I, relative to wild-type, the Kd(app) of fVIIa interaction with the R74A was elevated ∼190-fold. Moreover, unlike a normal amidolytic activity with the other mutants, the maximal activity of fVIIa in the presence of a saturating concentration of R74A was also impaired ∼2-fold (Table I). These results suggest that the interaction of the side chain of Arg74 with fVIIa may be responsible for allosterically changing the conformation of the active site pocket of fVIIa, leading to improvement in the catalytic efficiency of the protease. Thus, a cofactor-mediated conformational change in the active site pocket of fVIIa may be, at least partially, mediated through protease interaction with Arg74 of TF. Indeed, from the crystal structure of the sTF·fVIIa complex, residue Arg74 appears to make contact with residues in the protease domain of fVIIa (10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchofer A. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In contrast to the loss of affinity and cofactor function for most of the sTF2-219 mutants, the mutagenesis of three acidic residues and one basic residue of sTF2-219 around the 61-66 sequence resulted in an improved affinity for fVIIa and also improved maximal amidolytic activity (Table I). These residues are located on the opposite surface of the cofactor and thus are not expected to contact fVIIa (although Asp61 might be able to make contacts with fVIIa). It is not known how the neutralization of the charges of these residues improves the cofactor function of the molecules, although interestingly, these residues are all located within one of the very few α-helical regions on sTF. Proteolytic Function—The cofactor function of the sTF2-219 mutants in enhancing the proteolytic activity of fVIIa toward the natural substrates factors IX and X was also studied. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat for the activation of both substrates by fVIIa in complex with the sTF2-219 mutants are presented in Table II for factor IX and Table III for factor X. Note that Km and kcat values for the activation of factors IX or X by the fVIIa·sTF2-219 complex are reported here as apparent values. This is because both Km and kcat change as a function of phospholipid concentration due to partitioning of enzyme and substrate between the solution and membrane-bound phases as described in detail by Fiore et al. (22Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 143-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the cofactor mutants with the exception of D58N and R74A exhibited near normal or improved cofactor activity in promoting the fVIIa activation of both substrates. The kinetic basis for the defect with the D58N mutant cannot be readily analyzed, because the affinity of this mutant for fVIIa was dramatically impaired and the activation assay was carried out at a subsaturating concentration of the mutant due to a limited amount of the cofactor. However, a similar previous study with the same mutant of TF in the full-length form has indicated that the Asp58 mutant has only impaired affinity for fVIIa with a normal cofactor function (23Schullek J.R. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19399-19403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has been evidenced by the observation that fVIIa in complex with a saturating concentration of the Asp58 mutant exhibits a normal maximal activity (23Schullek J.R. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19399-19403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 3, the proteolytic cofactor function of the R74A mutant in activation of both factors IX and X by fVIIa was markedly impaired. The extent of impairment in the cofactor function of the R74A mutant was ∼2.5- and ∼6-fold for the activation of factors IX and X, respectively. In both cases, the primary defect in the cofactor function was due to impairment in the kcat of the activation reaction (Tables II and III). These results further support the hypothesis that the side chain of Arg74 may be in contact with a region of fVIIa that is allosterically linked to the active site pocket of the protease. The Ala substitution mutants of an acidic region in most C-terminal end of the TF N-terminal domain resulted in the improvement in the cofactor function of the TF mutants in the factor X but not factor IX activation assay (Table III). Thus, the catalytic efficiency of fVIIa in complex with the E105A mutant of sTF2-219 was improved 3.5-fold (Table III). It is likely that the charge neutralization of this residue eliminates a repulsive interaction of an acidic region of factor X (most likely γ-carboxyglutamic acid and/or EGF1 domain) with the fVIIa·sTF complex.Table IIKinetic constants for the sTF2-219-mediated activation of IX by fVIIasTFKm(app)kcatkcat/Km(app)10−9mmin−1106 μm−1min−1WT923 ± 1772.5 ± 0.182.7K15A893 ± 1782.8 ± 0.183.1K20A1068 ± 1463.1 ± 0.172.9E24A1220 ± 1763.3 ± 0.202.7E26A902 ± 1472.5 ± 0.192.8K28A900 ± 1702.5 ± 0.182.8K41A898 ± 1662.5 ± 0.162.8D44A851 ± 1572.3 ± 0.172.7K46A1052 ± 2273.2 ± 0.293.0K48A992 ± 1622.3 ± 0.152.3D54A954 ± 1493.4 ± 0.203.6E56N1149 ± 1932.9 ± 0.202.5D58NaThe kinetic values were determined at a subsaturating concentration of the sTF2-219 mutant (12 μm).1118 ± 1320.5 ± 0.020.4D61A581 ± 942.0 ± 0.113.4E62A874 ± 1063.0 ± 0.143.4K65A873 ± 1712.8 ± 0.173.2D66A981 ± 1192.9 ± 0.403.0K68A942 ± 1702.6 ± 0.162.8R74A904 ± 1421.0 ± 0.051.1E84A1083 ± 1863.0 ± 0.222.8E91A583 ± 952.1 ± 0.103.6E95A957 ± 1483.5 ± 0.433.7E99A872 ± 1073.1 ± 0.293.6E105A968 ± 912.9 ± 0.103.0a The kinetic values were determined at a subsaturating concentration of the sTF2-219 mutant (12 μm).

Open table in a new tab To provide further evidence that Arg74 is critical for the proteolytic function of fVIIa, the R74A mutant was used as a competitive inhibitor of factor X activation by fVIIa in complex with wild-type sTF2-219. As shown in Fig. 4, R74A inhibited the activation of factor X by fVIIa in complex with wild-type sTF2-219 in a concentration-dependent manner, and at a high concentration of the cofactor mutant, which was sufficient to displace most of the wild-type cofactor, the rate of factor X activation declined ∼2-fold, paralleling the rate of the substrate activation by the fVIIa in complex with the R74A mutant. These results suggest that the role of Arg74 in the cofactor function of TF is distinct from other charged residues under study and may confirm the hypothesis that it interacts with a site of fVIIa that is in allosteric linkage with the active site pocket of the protease. Previously, a similar cofactor role for the Asp44 of TF has also been postulated (8Kelly C.R. Schullek J.R. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In that study, an ∼4-fold impaired cofactor function for the D44A mutant of sTF in factor X activation by fVIIa has been reported (8Kelly C.R. Schullek J.R. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, in the current study, we noted an ∼2-fold impairment in the kcat of factor X activation by fVIIa in complex with the D44A mutant of sTF2-219 and this defect was partially compensated by an improvement in the Km(app) of the activation reaction (Table III). Moreover, unlike the defective cofactor function of the R74A mutant in the activation of both macromolecular substrates, the D44A mutant exhibited near normal cofactor function in the activation of factor IX (Table II). The differences in the results of two studies may be due to different experimental conditions used to evaluate the cofactor effect of this mutant. The previous study used a limiting concentration of TF in complex with excess fVIIa to evaluate the cofactor function of the mutant at 37 °C, whereas our studies were carried out with a limiting concentration of fVIIa in complex with an excess of the sTF2-219 mutant at room temperature. However, despite these differences, the observation that the kcat of factor X activation with D44A mutant was impaired ∼2-fold is in agreement with the previous hypothesis that Asp44 of TF is critical for the proteolytic function of fVIIa in the extrinsic factor Xase complex. In summary, we have mapped the functionally important basic and acidic residues of the N-terminal domain of TF and demonstrated that most of the charged residues critical of fVIIa binding are spatially located at the junction of the N- and C-terminal domains of TF. The results further suggest that, unlike the C-terminal domain of TF, which contains direct binding sites for interaction with both factors IX and X, the N-terminal domain of the cofactor may not interact with either substrate of fVIIa in the activation complex. Finally, we have identified Arg74 as a critical residue that appears to directly interact with a region of fVIIa that is in allosteric linkage with the active site pocket of the protease."

Devillers-Thiery A. Chemouilli P. Science. 1984; 225: 1335-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Two groups of neurotoxins have been characterized in various snake venoms as follows: short chain α-neurotoxin with 60-62 amino acids and four disulfide bonds; and long chain α-neurotoxin with 65-74 amino acids and an additional disulfide bond at the C terminus. Crystal and NMR structures for both groups of α-neurotoxins indicate that they share high structural homology, with three finger-like loops protruding from the palm-like core (2Low B.W. Preston H.S.

FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Because of the potential pharmacological significance for this protein family (4Le Du M.H. Ricciardi A. Khayati M. Menez R. Boulain J.C. Menez A. Ducancel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the binding activity of α-neurotoxins with their acetylcholine receptors has been intensively investigated based on the crystal structure of an acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) (5Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

These studies have shown that both long chain α-neurotoxin and short chain α-neurotoxin have binding activity with AChBP. The complex structural studies for α-bungarotoxin (a long chain α-neurotoxin) and its putative binding peptide in AChBP indicate that the second loop of α-bungarotoxin could insert into the interface of two adjacent subunits of the AChBP homopentamer to realize its binding activity (6Harel M.

Experimental data suggest that short and long toxins share a similar binding topology to nicotinic receptors (8Teixeira-Clerc F. Menez A. Kessler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25741-25747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the interactions between short chain α-neurotoxin and its receptors (AChRs) have been assigned to the insertion of the second loop into the interface of the α7 homopentamer, the binding activity can vary greatly for various short chain α-neurotoxins differing only at several residues (9Cheng Y. Meng Q.X. Wang W.Y. Wang J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). No crystal structures to date explain such functional differences clearly, especially at atomic resolution. In this study, we present atomic resolution crystal structures of two pharmacologically important proteins, atratoxin and atratoxin-b (a homolog of atratoxin but with lower toxicity) from the Naja atra venom. The atomic resolution crystal structure of atratoxin-b was refined to 0.92 Å from the previously reported (10Lou X.H. Tu X.Y. Pan G.Q. Xu C.Y. Fan R. Lu W.H. Deng W.H. Rao P.F. Teng M.K. Niu L.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) structure at 1.5 Å resolution determined by molecular replacement. However, the atratoxin structure could not be solved by molecule replacement because there are two planar atratoxin molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. By using erabutoxin A (PDB code 5EBX, the same model used to phase the atratoxin-b structure) as the search model, it was not possible to identify solutions because of the high R factors (∼53%), low correlation coefficients (∼19%), and no clear contrast between possible solutions and noise. Considering that the protein was crystallized in the presence of copper ions, anomalous diffraction data to 1.5 Å resolution at the copper K-edge (λ = 1.379 Å) were collected in addition to an atomic resolution (0.87 Å) data set collected at a wavelength of 0.916 Å. By using a SAD phasing method developed jointly by the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and MacCHESS, Cornell University (11Fan H.F. Han F.S. Qian J.Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

It is also interesting to note that the correct handedness was determined from only the copper substructure with the program ABS (28Hao Q. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 498-499Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The comparison of these two atomic resolution structures shows clearly the essential residues and their configurations involved in the binding of atratoxin to its target, which could be of importance in protein engineering (24Vita C. Roumestand C. Toma F. Menez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6404-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); the correlation between thermal motions of atratoxin at atomic resolution and the dynamic behavior of its NMR structures was revealed by the comparison of the anisotropy of atratoxin and the r.m.s. deviation of multiple NMR structures. In addition, the co-crystallization of copper in the crystal of atratoxin not only aids the phasing of the structure from one wavelength anomalous diffraction data but also causes the dimerization of atratoxin molecules in crystals and could affect hydrogen distributions in the atratoxin. Furthermore, the toxicity of atratoxin was analyzed under the condition of Cu2+ binding, providing an alternative way to study the toxicity of the protein. Determination of Copper Content in Crystals—In order to determine the ratio between the copper ions and the atratoxin molecule, four crystals from the crystallization drops were dissolved into 120 μl of 0.1 m HCl solutions. The A280 value of the sample solution was obtained by using a DU640 nucleic acid and protein analyzer (Beckman Coulter). The concentration of the protein was calculated from the standard curve of the proteins. The concentration of copper ions was examined by using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (Thermo Jarrell Ash Corp.). The sample was nitrated with nitric acid before loading onto the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. The Multimeric State of Atratoxin in Copper Solution—To study the effect of copper ions on the multimeric state of atratoxin, 20-μl protein samples were loaded onto a Protein-Pak™ Diol (OH) 100-μm 7.8 × 300-mm column, mounted on a Waters 600 system, pre-equilibrated with 0.02 m NaAc-HAc buffer, pH 4.6 (containing 0.15 m NaCl), and then eluted with the same solution. Various ratios of atratoxin to copper ions were achieved by using incremental protein concentrations of 1, 10, and 50 mg/ml. The monitor wavelength was 280 nm, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Protein Sequence and Gene Cloning—The sequence of atratoxin was determined by the Edman degradation method as implemented on an Applied Biosystems Procise 491 protein sequencer. The N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid residues were sequenced by using protein from dissolved crystals of atratoxin. The first strand cDNA synthesis and final amplification of two genes were obtained by using the access reverse transcriptase-PCR method. Typically, venom gland total RNA was isolated from the venom gland (from the southern mountain region, Anhui Province, China) with SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Compared with other neurotoxins, the conservative sequence was obtained and used to design two primers as follows: sense, 5′-AGGATACACCCTGGAATGTC-3′ (N terminus), and antisense, 5′-ATTGTTGCATCTGTCTGTTGTGC-3′ (C terminus). PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced (Takara, Japan). According to the sequence, the 3′-RACE amplification was performed with the following primers: 5′-CACTACAGGTTGTTCAGGT-3′ for atratoxin and 5′-AAAGTGAAGCCCGGTGTTAATC-3′ for atratoxin-b. The 5′-RACE amplification was performed with the following primers: atratoxin, 5′-(P)-TTTCAATGCCGTT-3′, 5′-GGCGTGATCACCGTGGATA-3′, 5′-GCAATTGGTCTCCCCACC-3′, 5′-AGGGGATGTGGTTGCCCTTC-3′, and 5′-GCGATGATTGTTGGTTGTGAC-3′; atratoxin-b, 5′-(P)-GATTAACACCGGG-3′, 5′-GGTCTGATCACCGTGGAAC-3′, 5′-GGTCTCCCCTGAACAAGT-3′, 5′-CGAAAGGGGATGTGGTTGCC-3′, and 5′-GCGATGATTGTTGGTTGTGAC-3′. 5′- and 3′-RACE were used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the 5′ and 3′ end cDNAs with the Full Race Core Set cDNA amplification kit (Takara, Japan). Crystallization and Data Collection—Atratoxin was purified and crystallized using procedures reported previously (25Tu X.Y. Huang Q.Q. Lou X.H. Teng M.K. Niu L.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Crystals of ∼0.4 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm were soaked in a NaCl solution (pH 4.6) containing 10% ethanol, 10 mm CuCl2, and 25% (v/v) glycerol for about 20 s and then subjected to cryogenic flash freezing at a temperature of 100 K. Both SAD data and atomic resolution data were collected under the same cryoprotection conditions. The anomalous data set was collected at the MacCHESS F2 station. The x-ray wavelength was optimized to 1.379 Å (equivalent to 8.98 keV) to collect the strongest anomalous signal from copper as indicated by fluorescence scanning. A total of 360 frames was recorded with an oscillation angle of 1° from one crystal. Shortly afterward, the atomic resolution data set to 0.87 Å was collected at MacCHESS F1 station, at a fixed wavelength of 0.916 Å. Data processing for both anomalous data and atomic resolution data was performed with the HKL2000 package (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar), and the statistics of data collection and processing are summarized in Table I. The Rmerge values for anomalous data and atomic resolution data were 14.0 and 6.2%, respectively, indicating that using a shorter wavelength, which usually means less absorption of x-ray to the crystal, may give better crystallographic statistics.Table ICrystallographic data and structure refinement statistics for two neurotoxinsData collectionSAD-atratoxinaThe data set of atratoxin was collected for SAD phasing.AtratoxinAtratoxin-bSpace groupC2221C2221P41212Unit cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)46.72, 47.29, 89.8546.81, 47.29, 90.0248.46, 48.46, 44.13Resolution ranges (Å)bThe values for the data in the highest resolution shell are shown in parentheses.20-1.50 (1.53-1.50)30-0.87 (0.90-0.87 Å)30-0.92 (0.94-0.92)Wavelength (Å)1.3790.920.92Temperature (K)100100100No. observations191,227443,936474,033No. unique reflections16,06976,11636,852Overall completeness (%)cCompleteness is the ratio of the number of observed reflections to the number of possible reflections.98.4 (99.0)92.8 (38.8)99.4 (92.0)Ratio of mean I/(I)26.67 (4.50)57.16 (3.55)81.02 (6.16)Rmerge (%)dRmerge=∑hkl∑j|I(hkl)j−〈I(hkl)〉|/∑hkl∑jI(hkl)j.

Open table in a new tab Atratoxin-b was purified and crystallized as reported before (10Lou X.H. Tu X.Y. Pan G.Q. Xu C.Y. Fan R. Lu W.H. Deng W.H. Rao P.F. Teng M.K. Niu L.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Crystals of ∼0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm were soaked in crystallization mother liquid with 25% (v/v) glycerol for 20 s and then subjected to flash freezing at the temperature of 100 K for cryoprotection. The atomic resolution data of 0.92 Å were collected and processed at MacCHESS F1 station using a similar procedure as described above. Crystallographic statistics for atratoxin-b data are also listed in Table I. Phasing with SAD Data for Atratoxin—To determine the structure of atratoxin from the anomalous scattering of copper atoms, a novel three-step phasing protocol was adopted, enabling the structure to be solved in few hours. The first step was to find substructures of these anomalous scatterers by a direct methods implementation (13Hao Q. Gu Y.X. Yao J.X. Zheng C.D. Fan H.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1274-1276Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The second step was to find the correct hand for the substructure without trying both possibilities in the following steps. The last step was to resolve phase ambiguity arising from SAD (11Fan H.F. Han F.S. Qian J.Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1984; 40: 495-498Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Hao Q. Gu Y.X. Zheng C.D. Fan H.F. J. Appl. Cryst. 2000; 33: 980-981Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Find Heavy Atoms Substructures with the Program SAPI—The copper anomalous scattering sites were located by the direct methods program SAPI (13Hao Q. Gu Y.X. Yao J.X. Zheng C.D. Fan H.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1274-1276Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), using the magnitudes of the anomalous differences, for reflections up to 2.5 Å resolution. Three potential copper sites were found by SAPI in about half a minute with default running parameters. There was a clear gap between three copper atoms peaks and other peaks in terms of peak height. Two rounds of Karle-recycle calculation made the substructure converge to an R factor of 31.3%, strongly indicating the correctness of the solution. Select the Correct Hand with the Program ABS—If the arrangement of anomalous scatterers is non-centrosymmetric then it is also necessary to find their absolute configuration (hand). This is usually done by going through all phasing procedures with two possible configurations and manually choosing one that gives right-hand α-helices in the electron density map. The ABS program, based on the Ps function method (27Woolfson M.M. Yao J. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 7-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hao Q. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 498-499Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), has been written to determine the absolute configuration at a much earlier stage, i.e. immediately after the heavy atoms sites are found by a direct methods or a Patterson procedure. For these three copper coordinates, hand was correctly assigned by using anomalous data at about 3.0 Å resolution cut off. The calculation of ABS is very fast and can usually finish in less than a minute. Resolve the Phase Ambiguity (SAD Phasing) and Improve Phases—Initial phases for all reflections to 1.5 Å resolution were generated by using the program OASIS (11Fan H.F. Han F.S. Qian J.Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1984; 40: 495-498Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The average figure of merit of phases was 0.54. Density modification using the CCP4 program DM (29Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) was then applied to the resulting phase set, and the average FOM was gradually improved to 0.65. Both electron density maps calculated using phases after OASIS and after OASIS/DM are traceable for the protein main chain. However, the OASIS/DM map gives better protein solvent contrast and clearer density. Model Building and Refinement of Atratoxin—The main chain was built automatically by the program ARP/wARP (30Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) using diffraction data from 12 to 1.5 Å. The initial R factor was 41.2%. After 50 cycles of free atom unrestrained refinements, the connectivity index increased steadily from 0.62 to 0.90, and the main chain peptide was successfully traced. In total, 110 residues, pertaining to two chains, were found by the program. Except for a few disordered residues at the molecular surface and the loop area, it was very easy to recognize and to build almost all side chains based on both 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps using the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.K. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Residues with poor electron density were assigned according to the cDNA sequence. Three peaks that appear on the difference map at the contour of 8.0σ corresponded to the anomalous scatterer peaks found by SAPI and were modeled as copper atoms. The crystallographic R factor of the model built at this stage (including the dummy free atoms) dropped to 18.5%. Further refinement with REFMAC (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) was performed with cross-validation by using 5% of the observed reflections. By using the high resolution data set in the resolution range 10-1.2 Å, the model was first refined to convergence with an R factor of 22.0% and an Rfree factor of 24.0% after solvent building. Then the diffraction data were transformed to SHELX format, and the 5% validation reflections were kept. The refinement continued with SHELX97-2 (33Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar) using conjugate gradient least squares minimization against an intensity-based residual target function that included distance, planarity, and chiral restraints. A bulk solvent correction (SWAT) was carried out. New ordered solvent molecules were found in the difference Fourier map. 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps were calculated after each step, and the model (protein and other molecules) was checked and rebuilt. The R and Rfree factors calculated after the first run, with isotropic B factors, were 21.68 and 24.63%, respectively. Then the anisotropic displacement parameters were introduced into the refinement, reducing the R and Rfree factors to 17.20 and 20.70%, respectively. At this stage, clear electron density was observed near several side chains, which were subsequently modeled in two conformations by the inspection of both Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc maps. In relation to the side chain disorder, the main chain was also found to adopt two conformations in residues 31 and 32 of molecule A and residues 34 and 35 of molecule B. Two ethanol molecules were added in the subsequent refinement based on the Fourier difference map. Hydrogen atoms were added to the model according to geometrical criteria, decreasing the R and Rfree factors by 0.5 and 0.9% respectively. In the post-refinement, nine partial occupancy copper ions and two sodium ions were added, and the structure was refined to convergence again, leading to a final R factor of 11.96% Rfree of 15.29% for all data in the resolution range 10-0.87 Å. Structural Refinement of Atratoxin-b—For atratoxin-b, the 1.55-Å crystal structure of the same protein (PDB code 1onj) was chosen as the starting model. The refinement continued with SHELX97-2 (33Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar) by using similar procedures as described for atratoxin. The final R factor and Rfree factor of atratoxin-b after adding riding hydrogen atoms were 11.42 and 13.29%, respectively. Eight residues were modeled as having alternative conformations in the final structure. Other structural statistics are listed in Table I. Protein Sequence and Gene Cloning—The N-terminal sequence of intact atratoxin, determined by protein sequencing, is LECHNQQSSQTPTTTGCSGGETNCYKKR (this is a correction to the previously reported result (25Tu X.Y. Huang Q.Q. Lou X.H. Teng M.K. Niu L.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar)). The C-terminal fragment sequence of the enzymatically digested fragments of atratoxin is NGIEINCCTTDRCNN. By reverse transcriptase-PCR utilizing the N-terminal and C-terminal sequence primers, two genes (atratoxin and atratoxin-b) were obtained (Fig. 1). Based on the gene sequences, the primers for 3′- and 5′-RACE were designed, and amplification was performed. The cloned atratoxin cDNA is 470 bp in length, encoding a product of 83 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment reveals that the peptide sequence of atratoxin is identical to that of cobrotoxin (34Yu C. Bhaskaran R. Chuang L.C. Yang C.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2131-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but their mRNAs have only 97% identities. There is a single mutation in the third base of the codon (ACC→ACA) in the encoding regions, which still deduces the same residue (a threonine) at position 13, and the other differences lie in the 3′-untranslational regions sporadically. We refer to the protein as atratoxin throughout the paper. Overall Crystallographic Structure—The final refined model of atratoxin contains 124 amino acid residues belonging to 2 molecules, A and B, 2 ethanol molecules, 12 copper ions (some with partial occupancy), 1 chlorine ion, 2 sodium ions, and 248 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. In total, 38 amino acid residues could be modeled as multiple conformations. Both molecules are folded into three adjacent loops rich in β-pleated sheets that protrude from a small globular core made rigid by four disulfide bridges (Cys3-Cys24, Cys17-Cys41, Cys43-Cys54, and Cys55-Cys60), and displaying the characteristic “three-finger” structure with a concave bowl-shaped face commonly found in neurotoxin (Fig. 2). The main chain of each molecule is organized into two anti-parallel β-pleated sheets as follows: one consists of strand 1 (residues 2-6) and strand 2 (residues 12-16) through four backbone H-bonds, and the other is the triple-stranded anti-parallel sheet with strand 3 (residues 24-30), strand 4 (residues 36-40), and strand 5 (residues 51-55). There are lower B factors for two stable β-sheets with H-bonds between strand 3 and strand 4, and between strand 3 and strand 5, respectively. But loop II (connecting strand 3 and strand 4) and loop III (the peripheral strand region 43-50) exhibit relatively higher B factors and less stability. The packing between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit adopts a back-to-face binding pattern (Fig. 2). Cu1 plays a key role in stabilizing the dimer through strong interactions with Glu38 of molecule A and His4, Arg59, and Asn62 of molecule B (Fig. 6A). Superposition reveals that molecule A and molecule B are not identical in conformation. The r.m.s. deviation between the C-α atoms of the two-stranded β-sheet is 0.140 Å and that between the C-α atoms of the triple-stranded β-sheet is 0.356 Å. The major difference between the molecules occurs in loop II and loop III. When these two loops are excluded from the superposition calculation, the r.m.s. deviation will drop to 0.320 Å from 0.759 Å for all C-α atoms (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Structural and anisotropic comparison of atratoxin with other neurotoxins.

Bhaskaran R. Chuang L.C. Yang C.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2131-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and its protein sequence is the same as that of atratoxin. The overall folds of the two structures are similar. The r.m.s. deviations between C-α atoms of the crystal structure and 11 generated NMR structures range from 1.85 to 2.84 Å. The largest deviations in the NMR structure from the crystal structure generally involve the regions of loop I, loop II, loop III, and one turn (residues 18-22). The superposition of the backbone atoms of the x-ray structure and the mean solution structure is shown in Fig. 3A.

Nocardicin A is the most potent of a series of monocyclic β-lactam antibiotics produced by this organism. Its activity has been attributed to a syn-configured oxime moiety and a d-homoseryl side chain attached through an unusual ether linkage to the core nocardicin framework.

Since their introduction in the late 1940s, the β-lactam antibiotics remain among the most widely used clinical agents in the treatment of bacterial infections. Principal among these are the penicillins and cephalosporins/cephamycins whose commercial products are semi-synthetic variants of the natural products penicillin N (penam nucleus) and cephalosporin/cephamycin C (cephem nucleus, Fig. 1). Three other structurally distinct families of naturally occurring β-lactam antibiotics are known. Two of these arise from mixed biosynthetic pathways, the clavams (e.g. clavulanic acid) (1Townsend C.A. Ho M.F. J. Am. Chem.

Nocardicin A (Fig. 1) is the most potent of the series and contains unusual structural features critical for its activity. First, the oxime moiety, an uncommon feature among natural products, must be present in the syn-configuration relative to the β-lactam ring. Second, it can be seen that a d-homoseryl side chain has been attached at a p-(hydroxyphenyl)glycine residue. Its presence is also essential for optimal antibiotic potency. This side chain, however, like isopenicillin N, is initially formed bearing the natural l-configured α-amino acid terminus. Thus, isopenicillin N is synthesized from a tripeptide containing an α-aminoadipic acid residue while the corresponding side chain site in isonocardicin A arises by the rare intermediate transfer of an l-3-amino-3-carboxypropyl unit from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet). Nature resorts, therefore, to the highly unusual inverted peptide incorporation of a nonproteinogenic amino acid in the formation of isopenicillin N, and an equally unusual transfer from AdoMet to achieve a flexible, linear N-acyl side chain of comparable length in isonocardicin A. For oxidative ring expansion and subsequent transformations to occur to the cephalosporins and cephamycins, this terminal α-amino acid center must first be epimerized to the d-configuration. This pivotal process has been studied extensively and is known in prokaryotes to be catalyzed by a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent epimerase (13Jensen S.E. Westlake D.W. Wolfe S. Can. J. Microbiol. 1983; 29: 1526-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Laiz L. Liras P. Castro J.M. Martin J.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 663-671Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been recently determined, however, that in fungal cephalosporin producers two proteins are required, an acyl-CoA synthetase and an acyl-CoA epimerase. This is the first example of such a two-protein epimerization system in secondary metabolism (15Ullan R.V. Casqueiro J. Banuelos O. Fernandez F.J. Gutierrez S. Martin J.F. J. Biol.

In the present studies we focus on the role of nocJ in nocardicin A biosynthesis by N. uniformis. Insertional disruption of this gene was carried out, and the effect of this mutation and its subsequent complementation was evaluated. In addition, NocJ was overproduced as the N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein and examined for its dependence on PLP and the ability to catalyze epimerization at C-9′ of the nocardicin side chain. The results from both in vivo and in vitro analyses of NocJ support a common finding that establishes its role as the nocardicin C-9′ epimerase.

The nocardicin production medium was previously described (12Hosoda J. Konomi T. Tani N. Aoki H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1977; 41: 2013-2020Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). ISP-2 and TSB were purchased from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). DNA Isolation, Manipulations, and Sequencing—Plasmid DNA isolation from E. coli was carried out using the Qiaprep Spin Miniprep kit (Valencia, CA) and total DNA isolation from N. uniformis strains followed the Gram-positive bacteria protocol for the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit. For Southern analysis, 32P-labeled probes were generated by random priming using the RadPrime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen) and hybridizations were conducted according to protocol (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: A.1-A.13Google Scholar). DNA sequencing to confirm constructs was carried out at the Biosynthesis & Sequencing Facility, Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, MD. Construction of nocJ::apra N. uniformis—The gene nocJ was amplified from cosmid DNA by PCR (17Gunsior M. Breazeale S.D. Lind A.J. Ravel J. Janc J.W. Townsend C.A. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The forward primer (5′-AAGGATCCGTGGGCGCGCTG-3′) possessed a BamHI restriction site (underlined) and contained the wild-type start codon. The reverse primer (5′-AAGGATCCTCAACGTAGCAGAGCTCC-3′) also possessed a BamHI restriction site and the native stop codon. The amplified fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site of pT7Blue-3, and the resulting vector linearized by digestion with AscI and treated with Klenow fragment and shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The EcoRI insert containing apra was treated with Klenow fragment and ligated into the linearized vector. The resulting nocJ::apra fragment was excised with BamHI and cloned into pULVK2 to provide pULVK2/JAm. The vector was isolated from E. coli JM110 and used to transform N. uniformis protoplasts, selecting for transformants with 200 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml apramycin. 2W. L. Kelly and C. A. Townsend, submitted publication. Individual colonies (8Townsend C.A. Brown A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 913-918Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were streaked onto ISP-2 solid medium containing 100 μg/ml apramycin. This operation was repeated, and spores of a single colony from each of the 8 plates were used to generate a mycelial stock. Potential mutants were identified according to renewed sensitivity to kanamycin and resistance to apramycin. Total DNA from wild-type and potential mutant strains was isolated and digested with DraIII and evaluated by Southern hybridizations to apra and nocJ. Evaluation of Nocardicin A Production in N. uniformis Strains— Mycelial stock of the N. uniformis strain of interest was used to inoculate a seed culture of 10 ml of TSB medium (containing 50 μg/ml apramycin or both apramycin and 25 μg/ml thiostrepton, if appropriate) and grown at 30 °C for 48 h. At this time, a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask with ∼160 glass beads containing 100 ml of nocardicin production medium supplemented with 0.5 mm l-methionine and l-4-hydroxyphenylglycine was inoculated with 2 ml of seed culture, and grown at 30 °C for 120 h. Samples of 1 ml were collected at 72, 96, and 120 h, and mycelia removed by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot of 250 μl was applied to paper discs placed upon LB solid medium infused with E. coli SC12155. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and examined the following morning for the appearance of antibiosis surrounding the discs. Additionally, 100-μl culture supernatants were diluted to 2 ml with 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH to 3 with acetic acid) then applied to ∼1.5 ml AG50W-X8 (Bio-Rad) resin pre-equilibrated with the loading buffer. The resin was washed, and the bound material was released from the resin with 3 ml of 1% NH4OH and collected in a tube containing 150 μl of 10% acetic acid to immediately neutralize the solution. The solvent was removed by lyophilization, and samples were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a PerkinElmer 235C diode array detector and LC410 pump using the Phenomenex Luna C18 (2Townsend C.A. Ho M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 1066-1068Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) 250 × 4.6 mm column (Torrance, CA) in 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (aqueous) at 1 ml/min. Chiral HPLC analysis was performed with an Astec Chirobiotic T 250 × 4.6 mm column (Whippany, NJ) in a mobile phase of 20% methanol and 0.1% triethylamine (pH to 4.1 with acetic acid) at 1 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 272 nm. Purification of Isonocardicin A from nocJ::apra N. uniformis—Isonocardicin A was purified from 3.2 liters of mutant N. uniformis culture supernatant following the protocol described for nocardicin A purification from the wild-type strain to provide 74.5 mg of a white solid (8Townsend C.A. Brown A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 913-918Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A UV-visible spectrum in ddH2O provided a λmax of 272 nm and ESI-MS provided a [M+H] ion peak at m/z 501.3 and an MS/MS analysis of that peak generated fragments at m/z 351.0 and 322.0; mp = 210–215 °C dec.

Complementation of nocJ::apra N. uniformis—nocJ was amplified by PCR from cosmid DNA (17Gunsior M. Breazeale S.D. Lind A.J. Ravel J. Janc J.W. Townsend C.A. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The forward primer (5′-AACATATGGGCGCGCTGCCGCGCGTG-3′) possessed an NdeI restriction site (underlined) and the native GTG start codon was replaced with ATG. The reverse primer (5′-GAGGATCCTCACTCAACGTAGCAGAGCAG-3′) contained a BamHI restriction site and the native stop codon. The PCR product was ligated into the EcoRV site of pT7Blue-3 to provide pT7Blue-3/nocJNH, then excised as the NdeI-BamHI fragment and ligated into appropriately digested pET24b(+). The XbaI-HindIII fragment containing nocJ behind the ribosomal binding site was excised and cloned into appropriately digested pIJ4070 to provide pIJ4070/nocJ. The BglII fragment of this vector containing nocJ, the ribosomal binding site, and ermE2 was excised and ligated into BamHI-digested pULVK2T to generate pULVK2T/nocJ. The plasmid was isolated from E. coli JM110 and used to transform nocJ::apra N. uniformis protoplasts. Transformants were confirmed by isolation of total DNA from N. uniformis and re-isolation of the plasmid from E. coli DH5α. Expression and Purification of NocJ—The NdeI-BamHI fragment from pT7Blue-3/nocJNH was cloned into appropriately digested pET28b(+) to provide pET28b(+)/nocJNH. The vector was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3), and then used to inoculate 50 ml of LB medium (50 μg/ml kanamycin), and the culture incubated at 37 °C and 300 rpm. The following morning, 4 × 10 ml aliquots of the overnight culture were used to inoculate 4 × 2-liter baffled flasks containing 500 ml of LB medium (50 μg/ml kanamycin). The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 300 rpm until OD600 = 0.6, and temperature reduced to 19 °C. Protein expression was induced with 10 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultures grown at 19 °C and 300 rpm for 8 h. Cells were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C overnight. The cell paste was thawed in 40 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12.9 mm benzamidine, and 200 μm PLP, pH 8.0). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the cell suspension incubated on ice for 20 min, at which time 40 μl each of 10 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease I and ribonuclease A were added and incubated for 20 min. The mixtures were sonicated at 100% amplitude for 10 × 10 s with 10 s rests, followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. To the CFE, 3.2 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) was added, and the suspension incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein was then eluted from the resin following the manufacturer's guidelines. To the elution fraction, 0.125 mm EDTA was added. The elution fraction was dialyzed for 2 h against dialysis buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 20 μm PLP, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.29 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.13 mm EDTA). The protein solution was then applied (10 ml/min) to a Poros HQ/H 100 × 4.6-mm column using the BioCAD 700E Perfusion Chromatography Work station (Per-Septive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in 50 mm bis-Tris and Tris, 10% glycerol, 20 μm PLP, pH 7.0. Protein was eluted using a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl over 10 column volumes (CV). NocJ-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 1 h against enzyme buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 20 μm PLP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C. The protein solution was finally applied (10 ml/min) to a Poros HS/M 100 × 4.6 mm column using the BioCAD system in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, and 20 μm PLP. A gradient was then applied from 0 to 1 m NaCl over 10 CV, and the fractions checked for protein content by their absorbance at 280 nm and 12% SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing NocJ were pooled together and concentrated with an Amicon PM-10 membrane. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211715) Google Scholar). The pyridoxal 5′-phosphate content of NocJ was determined by obtaining the optical spectrum of the protein in 0.1 n NaOH using ∈388 of 6600 m–1 cm–1 (23Peterson E.A. Sober H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 169-175Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Sodium Borohydride Inactivation of NocJ—To 100 μl of 2.53 μm NocJ in enzyme buffer, 5 μl freshly prepared 100 mm sodium borohydride in water was added. The buffer was exchanged with enzyme buffer lacking PLP. The activity of the protein was examined in a 100-μl reaction containing 0.2 μm of either NocJ obtained from PLP-free buffer or sodium borohydride-treated NocJ, 0.5 mm nocardicin A in 50 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.4, with and without the addition of 40 μm PLP. Reactions incubated at 30 °C for 2 h and were quenched by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, as above. A 4-μl aliquot was analyzed by chiral HPLC. Chiral HPLC Assay for NocJ-catalyzed Epimerization—In a final volume of 500 μl, 2 μm N-His6-NocJ, 0.5 mm of nocardicin substrate, 40 μm PLP were mixed together in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The reactions were permitted to incubate at 30 °C for 22 h, and 80-μl aliquots were obtained at 0, 2, 6, and 22 h. Samples were heat-quenched at 95 °C for 5 min and insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Either 40 μl of the nocardicin C or 4 μl of the isonocardicin A and nocardicin A reactions were analyzed by chiral HPLC. NocJ-catalyzed Deuterium Exchange in Nocardicin A—NocJ enzyme buffer was exchanged with deuterated enzyme buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 10% glycerol-OD3, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm PLP in D2O, pD 7.4). The reactions were set up in 8 ml as follows: 1 μm N-His6-NocJ, 40 μm PLP, and 0.5 mm nocardicin A in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pD 7.4 in D2O. Reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 20 h. At 18 h, the entire reaction was quenched by immersion of the reaction vessel in a boiling water bath for 5 min and filtered over a 0.45-μm filter. The diastereomeric mixture was purified by semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC, and lyophilized to a white powder. A UV-visible spectrum (in ddH2O) provided a λmax at 272 nm; ESI-MS generated [M+H] ion peak at m/z 502.5 and MS/MS of this peak afforded fragment ions at m/z 352.0, 335.0, and 323.0; 400 MHz 1H NMR (D2O + K2CO3) δ: 7.50 (2 H, d, J = 8.8 Hz, Ar), 7.23 (2 H, d, J = 8.4 Hz, Ar), 7.03 (2 H, d, J = 8.4 Hz, Ar), 6.89 (2 H, d, J = 8.8 Hz, Ar), 5.32 (1 H, s, H-5), 4.99 (1 H, m, H-3), 4.24 (2 H, m, H-7′), 3.86 (1 H, t, J = 5.2 Hz, H-4α), 3.26 (1 H, m, H-4β), 2.34 (2 H, m, H-8′). Kinetic Measurements of NocJ with Isonocardicin A and Nocardicin A—Calibration curves of both isonocardicin A and nocardicin A derivatized with GITC were prepared using 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard. Assay mixtures were prepared with set concentrations of N-His6-NocJ (0.02 μm and 0.04 μm for isonocardicin A; 0.08 mm for nocardicin A) in 100 μl, (1 mm and higher of substrate) 200 μl (0.5 mm substrate), 500 μl (0.1 mm substrate), or 1000 μl (0.05 mm substrate) and 40 μm PLP in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Following a quench at 95 °C for 5 min, the solvent from the 100-μl reactions was removed in vacuo and the pellet stored at –80 °C. The remaining samples were lyophilized following the heat quench, and protein and salt removed by precipitation in half the reaction volume of 75% acetonitrile (aqueous), then the solvent was removed in vacuo and the pellet stored at –80 °C for later derivatization. The reaction pellet was resuspended in 10 μl 50% acetonitrile and 0.4% triethylamine (aqueous), 0.5 μl triethylamine, and 13 μl 3 mg/ml GITC (6 mg/ml for reactions that had contained greater than 1 mm nocardicin A). Derivatization reactions incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, and were then centrifuged to pellet remaining salt. An 18-μl aliquot was diluted to 80 μl with an aqueous calibrant and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using an Agilent Technologies 1100 system with a diode array detector on a Phenomenex Luna C18 (2Townsend C.A. Ho M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 1066-1068Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) 250 × 4.6 mm and monitoring absorbance at 272 nm. The mobile phase utilized was 36% methanol, 7.5% acetonitrile, 56.5% ddH2O, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min. Analysis of nocJ—The open reading frame nocJ is predicted to encode a protein consisting of 327 amino acids. A PSI-BLAST analysis (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58690) Google Scholar) of this hypothetical protein reveals that NocJ has similarity to a number of proteins designated as ACC deaminases. The actual function for a large number of these proteins is unknown, such as the one for which NocJ has the most similarity, a putative PLP-dependent deaminase from Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato DC3000 (32% identity, 44% similarity) (25Buell C.R. Joardar V. Lindeberg M. Selengut J. Paulsen I.T. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Deboy R.T. Durkin A.S. Kolonay J.F. Madupu R. Daugherty S.

The similarity between NocJ and the ACC deaminases is not particularly strong, but careful analysis of the alignments with these proteins, however, revealed the greatest similarity was observed in the immediate vicinity of the lysine residue responsible for binding the PLP cofactor (30Murakami T. Kiuchi M. Ito H. Matsui H. Honma M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Yao M. Ose T. Sugimoto H. Horiuchi A. Nakagawa A. Wakatsuki S. Yokoi D.

Examination of the region surrounding the PLP-binding lysine revealed NocJ also contains a lysine at this position, corresponding to Lys51 of the H. saturnus enzyme. Disruption of nocJ in N. uniformis—The nocJ gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and initially cloned into the E. coli vector pT7Blue-3. The apramycin resistance cassette (apra) was inserted into the unique AscI restriction site of nocJ, and the resulting nocJ::apra fragment cloned into the E. coli-Nocardia shuttle vector pULVK2 (32Kumar C.V. Coque J.-J.R. Martin J.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 4086-4093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to form pULVK2/EAm. The resulting vector was isolated from the DNA methylation-deficient E. coli JM110 and introduced into N. uniformis by PEG-mediated protoplast transformation (21Kim C.F. Lee S.K. Price J. Jack R.W. Turner G. Kong R.Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Following two rounds of non-selective replication, potential mutants were identified according to retained resistance to apramycin and renewed sensitivity to kanamycin.

Free GPIs that are not attached to macromolecules are present in L. major as intermediates of protein-GPI and polysaccharide-GPI synthesis or as terminal glycolipids. The importance of the intracellular location of GPIs in vivo for functions of the glycolipids is not appreciated. To examine the roles of intracellular free GPI pools for attachment to polypeptide, a GPI-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLCp) from Trypanosoma brucei was used to probe trafficking of GPI pools inside L. major. The locations of GPIs were determined, and their catabolism by GPI-PLCp was analyzed with respect to the intracellular location of the enzyme. GPIs accumulated on the endo-lysosomal system, where GPI-PLCp was also detected. A peptide motif [CS][CS]-x(0,2)-G-x(1)-C-x(2,3)-S-x(3)-L formed part of an endosome targeting signal for GPI-PLCp. Mutations of the endosome targeting motif caused GPI-PLCp to associate with glycosomes (peroxisomes). Endosomal GPI-PLCp caused a deficiency of protein-GPI in L. major, whereas glycosomal GPI-PLCp failed to produce the GPI deficiency. We surmise that (i) endo-lysosomal GPIs are important for biogenesis of GPI-anchored proteins in L. major; (ii) sequestration of GPI-PLCp to glycosomes protects free protein-GPIs from cleavage by the phospholipase. In T. brucei, protein-GPIs are concentrated at the endoplasmic reticulum, separated from GPI-PLCp.

The exocytic system is continuous yet highly compartmentalized; it includes the ER, Golgi, secretory vesicles, and in highly polarized cells (e.g. trypanosomatids) parts of the endosomal system where the secretory and endocytic pathways converge (12Ghedin E. Debrabant A. Engel J.C. Dwyer D.M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Landfear S.M. Ignatushchenko M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In L. major, the importance of intracellular pools of GPIs has not been studied in the context of biological functions. For example, it is held that GPIs are synthesized within the ER, yet there is no direct evidence that GPIs are added to proteins in ER. Only in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has it been demonstrated conclusively that when anterograde vesicle traffic is blocked GPIs are added to protein in the ER (14Suetterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmoeller F. Schroeder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714PubMed Google Scholar). Because GPIs are present on the plasma membrane of Leishmania, it stands to reason that many areas of the secretory pathway might contain the glycolipids (8Ralton J.E. Mullin K.A. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unanswered questions in the field include the following: Do GPIs accumulate to different extents in different organelles of the endo/exocytic pathway of Leishmania? Are all GPIs in the secretory pathway equally competent for addition to proteins? Are GPIs added to protein in the ER? How is the biosynthesis/storage of GPIs coordinated with catabolic enzymes that might cleave the glycolipids? These questions deserve to be addressed for Leishmania and other eukaryotes because there are clear differences between vertebrate cells, for example, and S. cerevisiae in the molecular machinery and pathways for endo/exocytosis (15Bird P.

Heterologous (stable) expression of GPI-PLCp in L. major confers a GPI-negative phenotype on the cells by depleting intermediates of protein-GPI biosynthesis (21Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H.

The shortage of prefabricated GPIs for anchoring polypeptides to membranes leads to constitutive secretion of major cell surface polypeptides (e.g. gp63) that should have been GPI-anchored. These proteins enter the ER because of their N-terminal signal peptide but lack signals for retention in the cell (21Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S.

Peroxisomes belong to the microbody group of organelles (for review, see Ref. 23Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Important for both catabolic (e.g. β-oxidation of fatty acids, decomposition of hydrogen peroxide) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g. ether-lipid and cholesterol), peroxisomes in different eukaryotes may contain specialized pathways (e.g. glyoxylate cycle in plants and purine synthesis in mammals (for review, see Ref. 23Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)). The trypanosomatids (e.g. Leishmania spp. and T. brucei) are deeply diverged eukaryotes (24Philippe H. Germot A. Moreira D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Dacks J.B. Doolittle W.F. Cell. 2001; 107: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In these organisms, peroxisomes, in addition to being the organelle in which ether-lipid synthesis and β-oxidation of fatty acids take place, harbor the first seven enzymes of the glycolysis pathway (for review, see Ref. 26Parsons M. Furuya T. Pal S. Kessler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consequently, peroxisomes are termed “glycosomes.” Mistargeting of glycolytic enzymes to the cytosol is lethal in the bloodstream form of T. brucei (27Blattner J. Helfert S. Michels P. Clayton C.

Mensa-Wilmot, submitted for publication. Concurrently, GPI-PLCp was used as a “catabolic probe” of free protein-GPIs in Leishmania. Both GPIPLCp and protein-GPIs were detected on the endo-lysosomal system of L. major. However, several cysteine mutations in GPI-PLCp caused the enzyme to localize to glycosomes. Glycosomal GPI-PLCp did not cause a protein-GPI deficiency in L. major. Thus, endo-lysosomal GPIs are important for GPI addition to protein. Further, targeting of GPI-PLCp to glycosomes sequesters the enzyme from free protein-GPIs in vivo. Data obtained in T. brucei where GPI-PLCp is endogenous are consistent with the “GPI sequestration” hypothesis. Plasmids—A GPI-phospholipase C plasmid pUTK-GPIPLC was obtained by insertion of a GPI-PLC coding region (19Carrington M. Bülow R. Reinke H. Overath P. Mol. Biochem.

The GPI-PLC insert was generated by PCR using a forward primer KCR4 (5′-TAAGGATCCTTAACACAGGAGGCAGCTAatgtttggtggtgta-3′) and the reverse primer KCR5 (5′-TATGTGGATCCTTAtgaccttgcggtttggt-3′). KCR4 has a BamHI site (underlined) followed by a stop codon (italicized), an AUG-proximal region (e.g. lacZ-CTA (italicized), and finally a sequence encoding the first 4 amino acids of GPI-PLCp (in lowercase lettering) (33Teilhet M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1173-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reverse primer KCR5 contains a BamHI site (underlined), a stop codon (bold italicized), and the last 7 amino acids of GPI-PLCp (lowercase) (19Carrington M. Bülow R. Reinke H. Overath P. Mol.

BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pUTK-GPIPLC using a GeneEditor kit (Promega; Madison, WI). Primer sequences for each set of cysteine mutations were as follows (mutated nucleotides are in bold), C24A, 5′-TTGACCAATCGCTTTCTTCTCAATGG-3′; C80A, 5′-AGAAAGATTTTGCGCACGTCC CCA-3′; C184A, 5′-CTGCCAGAGGTTCGC- AAGTGGTGT-3′; C269S/C270S, 5′-GCGGTGGCAGCGTCTTCTGGCGCGTGTCCC-3′; C269S/C273S, 5′-GCGGTGGCAGCGTCTTGTGGCGCGTCTCCCGGTTCACAT-3′; C270S/C273S, 5′-GCAGCGTGTTCT- GGCGCGTCTCCCGGTTCACAT-3′; C269S/C270S/C273S, 5′-GCGGTGGCAGCGTCTTCTGGCGCGTCTCCCGGTTCACAT-3′; C332A, 5′-GAAGGCACTGCGACTGTTAAGGGA-3′; and C347A, 5′-GTTGCATTA-GCGGTTCATTTAAACA CC-3′. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (Integrated Biotechnology Laboratories, University of Georgia, Athens). Leishmania Transfection—L. major promastigote strain LT252-CC1 (36LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) was cultivated at 27 °C in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (1 × 107/ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed once with ice-cold electroporation buffer (21 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2PO4, 6 mm glucose) and electroporated with the following conditions; 475 V, 800 microfarads, 13 ohms, one-pulse (BTX ECM-600 apparatus) (37Debrabant A. Ghedin E. Dwyer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16366-16372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 8-12 h at 27 °C before the addition of 30 μg/ml G418 to select stable transfectants. When specified, cells were grown in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 for 21-28 days before use (see appropriate figure legends). GPI-PLC Enzyme Assay—Leishmania (1 × 107 cells/ml) growing in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 were harvested, washed in PBS and lysed in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (2.1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 mmN-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 0.4 unit aprotinin) (38Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged for 20 min (14,000 × g, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of GPI-PLC assay buffer AB (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation (14,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), portions of the supernatant were added to 15 μl of GPI-PLC assay buffer containing 2 μg of [3H]myristate-labeled membrane form variant surface glycoprotein ([3H]mfVSG) (38Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 500 μl of water-saturated butanol. The amount of [3H]dimyristoylglycerol released from [3H]mfVSG was quantified by scintillation counting of 400 μl of the organic phase. Lysates were titrated to ensure that the amount of enzyme measured was within the linear range of the assay (i.e. 0.1-1.0 unit) (38Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration of cell lysates was determined with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Western Blotting—For detection of gp63, parasites were lysed in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture and 5 mmp-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate followed by incubation on ice for 15 min. The lysate was centrifuged (14,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min), and the pellet was resuspended in high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitor mixture and 5 mmp-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate. After centrifugation (14,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) and washing with hypotonic buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture and 5 mmp-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate, the pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of 2.5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (14% minigel) and transferred to Immobilon P membrane. Western blotting of the membrane with anti-gp63 (1:2,000) (39McGwire B. Chang K.-P. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To monitor glycoproteins to which concanavalin A (ConA) bound, the Immobilon P membrane (see preceding paragraph) was blocked in 5% nonfat milk (Carnation) in PBS and treated with 5 μg/ml ConA for 1 h at 27 °C. The membrane was washed with PBS followed by incubation with anti-ConA antibody (Sigma) (1:6,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Applied Science) (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h and then processed for antigen detection with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (41Mensa-Wilmot K.

Organelle Detection in Live Cells—Endo-lysosomal compartments were identified after uptake of three fluorescent markers: dextran-Texas Red, FM4-64, and LysoTracker Red. For endocytosis of dextran-Texas Red, Leishmania at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml were gently pelleted (2,000 × g, 2 min) and resuspended in 500 μl of M199 medium containing 500 μg/ml dextran-Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at 27 °C for 10 or 30 min. Cells were also stained (in 500 μl of M199 medium) with 10 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) froma4mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide). Acidic organelles (endosomes and lysosomes) were stained with 100 nm LysoTracker Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at 27 °C for 5 min-1 h. Golgi complex was labeled with BODIPY-TR ceramide (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Leishmania were incubated with 5 μm BODIPY-TR ceramide bound to defatted bovine serum albumin for 90 min (1 h at 4 °C, and 30 min at 27 °C) (42Ilgoutz S.C. Mullin K.A. Southwell B.R. McConville M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3643-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To detect protein-GPIs, α-toxin (2.5 μg/ml in PBS) was added to fixed/permeabilized or nonpermeabilized cells (30 min at 27 °C) followed by ConA-Alexa Fluor 594 (5 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes, Inc.) (30 min at 27 °C). 2Z. Zheng, R. K. Tweten, and K. Mensa-Wilmot, submitted for publication. α-Toxin was detected with anti-α-toxin antibody (1:1,500) (30Ballard J. Bryant A. Stevens D. Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 784-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. A C-terminal fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to GPI-PLCp (i.e. GPIPLCp-GFP) was visualized in live L. major as described previously (43Mullin K.A. Foth B.J. Ilgoutz S.C. Callaghan J.M. Zawadzki J.L. McFadden G.I. McConville M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2364-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DNA was stained with DAPI (10 μm in CitiFluor solution (CitiFluor Ltd.)). Immunofluorescence Assays—Log phase cells (1 × 107/ml) were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (8 min, on ice), washed in PBS, and adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. The cells were permeabilized with 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100 (200 μl/coverslip) for 5 min at 4 °C. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For studies with T. brucei bloodstream, cells were fixed as described but permeabilized with methanol (5 min, -20 °C) before processing as described below. To detect GPI-PLCp, anti-GPIPLC (anti-peptide) antibody RC300 (1:1,200 dilution in blocking solution; 200 μl total volume) or monoclonal 2A6-6 (1:1,500 dilution in blocking solution; 200 μl total volume) (32Hereld D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8914-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was added for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PBS, twice with high salt buffer (PBS plus 500 mm NaCl), and twice with PBS. The cells were then immersed in 200 μl of a 1:1,000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or a 1:2,000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C. The ER was visualized by detection of BiP with anti-BiP antibody (1:2,000 dilution) (44Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosomes were detected with antibody against hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) (45Shih S. Hwang H.Y. Carter D. Stenberg P. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1534-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (a 1:1,000 dilution). 2Z. Zheng, R. K. Tweten, and K.

The cell nucleus and kinetoplast (mitochondrial DNA) were stained with 10 μm DAPI in CitiFluor. Labeled cells were viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMIRBE). Images were captured using an interline chip-cooled CCD camera (Orca 9545: Hamamatsu) and processed with OpenLab 3.1.2 software (Improvision, Inc.). In both organelle detection and immunofluoresence assays, more than 100 cells were visualized microscopically. Data presented in each figure are representative of those found in at least 90% of the population, unless otherwise noted. Exploration of GPI Utilization in L. major—To investigate functions of intracellular pools of free GPIs in L. major, a “probe” for GPIs was needed in living cells. GPI-PLCp from T. brucei was highly suitable as the in vivo probe of GPIs because heterologous expression of the enzyme in L. major causes a deficiency of (free) protein-GPI without affecting polysaccharide-GPI metabolism (21Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 46Mensa-Wilmot K. Garg N. McGwire B.S. Lu H.G. Zhong L. Armah D.A. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). L. major expressing GPI-PLCp or cysteine mutants of the enzyme were analyzed for two reasons. First, most Cys mutants of GPI-PLCp (expressed in Escherichia coli) retain enzyme activity (47Carnall N. Webb H. Carrington M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 48Rashid M.B. Russell M. Mensa-Wilmot K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Second, in some biological systems Cys mutations can alter intracellular location of polypeptides (49Pace A.J. Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 50Lutjens R. Igarashi M. Pellier V. Blasey H. Di Paolo G. Ruchti E. Pfulg C.

Therefore, we reasoned that Cys mutants of GPI-PLCp, compared with unmutated enzyme, could have different intracellular locations that might lead to divergent effects of the enzyme on GPIs in L. major. For our work, mutations of Cys to alanine (Ala) or serine (Ser) in GPI-PLCp were constructed. It was important to test whether the altered proteins retained enzyme activity in L. major. For this purpose, in vitro experiments were performed; lysates of L. major transfectants expressing GPI-PLCp or Cys mutants of the enzyme (e.g. C80A) were used to cleave exogenous [3H]myristate-labeled VSG (38Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Cys mutants of GPI-PLCp exhibited enzyme activity in the range detected for the unmutated protein (Fig. 1A). No GPI-PLCp activity was detected in L. major transfectants expressing pUTK (34Rashid M.

A Q81L mutant of GPI-PLCp was devoid of enzyme activity (Fig. 1A). These observations are consistent with data from earlier studies of enzyme activity in E. coli (34Rashid M. Mensa-Wilmot K.

Heterologous expression of GPI-PLCp in L. major produces a GPI deficiency that is marked by accelerated secretion of gp63, the major GPI-anchored protein (21Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P.

From Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B), gp63 was reduced in cells expressing GPI-PLCp (Fig. 1B, compare lane 1 with lane 2). Deficiency of cell-associated gp63 also occurred in L. major expressing C184A and C347A mutants of GPI-PLCp (termed class II Cys mutants) (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 9). In contrast, L. major transfected with C80A, C269S/C270S, C269S/C273S, C270S/C273S, and C269S/C270S/C273S mutants of GPI-PLCp (termed class I Cys mutants) retained gp63 (Fig. 1B compare lanes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 with lanes 4 and 9). This last result indicated that L. major containing the latter (class I) Cys mutants of GPI-PLCp were no longer GPI-deficient.

https://openalex.org/W2128678681,"The Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) negative regulator of splicing (NRS) is an RNA element that represses splicing and promotes polyadenylation of viral RNA. The NRS acts as a pseudo 5′ splice site (ss), and serine-arginine (SR) proteins, U1snRNP, and U6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are implicated in its function. The NRS also efficiently binds U11 snRNP of the U12-dependent splicing pathway, which is interesting, because U11 binds only poorly to authentic substrates that lack a U12-type 3′ splice site. It is of considerable interest to understand how the low abundance U11 snRNP binds the NRS so well. Here we show that U11 can bind the NRS as a mono-snRNP in vitro and that a G-rich element located downstream of the U11 site is required for efficient binding. Mutational analyses indicated that two of four G tracts in this region were important for optimal U11 binding and that the G-rich region did not function indirectly by promoting U1 snRNP binding to an overlapping site. Surprisingly, inactivation of U2 snRNP also decreased U11 binding to the NRS. The NRS harbors a branch point-like/pyrimidine tract sequence (BP/Py) just upstream of the U1/U11 site that is characteristic of 3′ splice sites. Deletion of this region decreased U2 and U11 binding, and deletion of the G-rich region also reduced U2 binding. The G element, but not the BP/Py sequence, was also required for U11 binding to the NRS in vivo as assessed by minor class splicing from the NRS to a minor class 3′ss from the P120 gene. These results indicate that efficient U11 binding to the isolated NRS involves at least two elements in addition to the U11 consensus sequence and may have implications for U11 binding to authentic splicing substrates.

An important step in the production of most mRNAs is the removal of intron sequences from pre-mRNA by the process of RNA splicing. Different combinations of exons can be combined via alternative splicing to generate numerous proteins from a single gene (1Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and it is now appreciated that regulated splicing accounts for great protein diversity (1Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev.

Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). RNA splicing is also used by many viruses that infect eukaryotic cells as a means to expand their coding capacity and to regulate gene expression (4Flint S.J. Enquist L.W. Krug R.M. Racaniello V.R. Skalka A.M. Principles of Virology. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2000Google Scholar).

Hughes S. Varmus H. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 205-261Google Scholar, 6Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J.

In addition to alternative splicing, retroviruses also exhibit incomplete splicing such that a large fraction of the primary transcripts remain unspliced and, in contrast to unspliced host cell mRNAs, are transported to the cytoplasm where they serve as mRNA and as genomes for progeny virions. These RNA processing events make retroviruses useful tools for studying the cellular RNA processing machinery, and determining how these events are controlled is required for understanding these important aspects of viral replication.RNA splicing takes place in a large macromolecular complex termed the spliceosome in which five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and a large number of accessory proteins cooperate to identify splice sites and assemble the complex (8Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 9Burge C.B. Tushchl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1999: 525-560Google Scholar). A dynamic network of snRNA-snRNA and snRNA-substrate interactions takes place to further identify the splice sites and to form the catalytic core of the spliceosome (10Nilsen T.W. Simons R. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1998: 279-307Google Scholar). Two splicing pathways have been identified (U2-dependent and U12-dependent), which excise introns with distinct cis splicing signals and differ in snRNP utilization (9Burge C.B. Tushchl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1999: 525-560Google Scholar, 11Tarn W.Y. Steitz J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 132-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although U5 is utilized by both spliceosomes, the more abundant U2-dependent spliceosome contains U1, U2, U4, and U6 snRNPs, whereas the minor, U12-dependent pathway utilizes the low abundance U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac snRNP counterparts. Non-snRNP splicing factors such as SR proteins are also shared between the two pathways (12Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Dietrich R.C. Shukla G.C. Fuller J.D. Padgett R.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1378-1388PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly pathways and catalytic properties of the two spliceosomes are quite similar despite the differences in splicing signals and spliceosome composition (11Tarn W.Y. Steitz J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 132-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), yet important differences between the two pathways have been observed. Notably, U1 and U2 snRNPs are found as discrete particles in nuclear extracts and can independently bind to the 5′ss and branch point sequence (BPS), respectively, whereas U11 and U12 snRNPs can form a di-snRNP that cooperatively binds the 5′ss and BPS and only poorly associates with isolated splice sites (14Chiara M.D. Reed R.

Polony T.S. Paca R.E. Beemon K.L. Virology. 2002; 302: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, the NRS also is required for optimal polyadenylation of viral RNA, because deletions or mutations that disrupt NRS splicing inhibition also lead to read-through transcripts (19O'Sullivan C.T. Polony T.S. Paca R.E. Beemon K.L. Virology. 2002; 302: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Fogel B.L. McNally L.M. McNally M.T.

For splicing inhibition, the NRS is thought to act as a pseudo 5′ss that non-productively associates with 3′ splice sites to prevent their interaction with the authentic 5′ss (26Gontarek R.R. McNally M.T. Beemon K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Cook C.R. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2394-2400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NRS can also inhibit splicing of heterologous introns in vivo and in vitro (26Gontarek R.R. McNally M.T. Beemon K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Important splicing regulators called SR proteins bind to high-affinity sites in the upstream portion of the ∼230-nt NRS and serve to recruit U1 snRNP to a downstream binding site (28McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29McNally L.M. McNally M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). U1 binding appears critical, because mutations that diminish U1 binding inactivate the NRS and abolish interactions with a 3′ splice site (27Cook C.R. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2394-2400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hibbert C.S. Gontarek R.R. Beemon K.L. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Other mutations in the U1 binding site activate splicing from the NRS (30McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hibbert C.S. Gontarek R.R. Beemon K.L. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Paca R.E. Hibbert C.S. O'Sullivan C.T. Beemon K.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7763-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that U1 binding is a required but not final step in the pathway leading to inhibition. These mutations and the potential for an extended base pairing interaction with U6 snRNA (see Fig. 1) suggest the intriguing possibility that inhibition results from an inappropriate, non-productive U6 interaction. The importance of the NRS was shown with viral constructs harboring U1-site mutations, which produced viruses with mildly delayed replication kinetics (19O'Sullivan C.T. Polony T.S. Paca R.E. Beemon K.L. Virology. 2002; 302: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and by the increased incidence of lymphomas in infected chickens (33Polony T.S. Bowers S.J. Neiman P.E. Beemon K.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9378-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the NRS also very efficiently binds U11 snRNP of the U12-dependent splicing pathway, about as well as U1 snRNP despite it being ∼100-fold less abundant than U1 (26Gontarek R.R. McNally M.T. Beemon K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The NRS contains a consensus U11-type 5′ss sequence that overlaps the U1 site but no corresponding U12 consensus sequence, which is highly conserved in U12-type introns. The NRS U11 site is not used in viral or heterologous constructs containing U2-type 3′ splice sites, but it is used accurately and efficiently when paired with a U12-type 3′ss (30McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, U11 is dispensable for splicing inhibition, because mutations that selectively eliminate U11 binding actually increase splicing inhibition (30McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hibbert C.S. Gontarek R.R. Beemon K.L. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas U1 is required for splicing inhibition, U11 is not but may function to fine-tune NRS activity by controlling the degree of U1 binding to the overlapping site. The U11 site plays a role in the virus life cycle, because viral constructs harboring U11-site mutations produce viruses with mildly delayed replication kinetics (19O'Sullivan C.T. Polony T.S. Paca R.E. Beemon K.L. Virology. 2002; 302: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 2Y. Wang and M. T. McNally, unpublished data.2Y. Wang and M. T. McNally, unpublished data.We are interested in the cis determinants that underlie the surprisingly efficient binding of U11 snRNP to the NRS in the absence of a corresponding U12-dependent 3′ss. Here, we show that the NRS efficiently binds U11 in vitro, whereas 5′ splice sites from two different bona fide U12-dependent genes do not, and we show that a downstream G-rich region is required for optimal U11 binding to the NRS. Surprisingly, U11 can still bind the NRS in vitro when U12 snRNP is destroyed. The G element was also required for optimal U11 binding in vivo as assessed by U12-dependent splicing from the NRS to the 3′ss of the P120 gene. Unexpectedly, inactivation of U2 snRNP decreased U11 binding in vitro, and deletion of a U2-type 3′ss-like sequence just upstream of the U11 site also decreased in vitro U2 and U11 binding; this deletion did not affect U12-dependent NRS splicing in vivo, however. Thus, two regions surrounding the U11 site are required for efficient U11 binding to the isolated NRS in vitro, which may distinguish the NRS from authentic U12-dependent 5′ splice sites that do not associate well with U11 in isolation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—RSV sequences are from the PrC strain (34Meric C. Spahr P.F. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 450-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with sequence coordinates as described by Schwartz et al. (35Schwartz D.E. Tizard R. Gilbert W. Cell. 1983; 32: 853-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Plasmids described previously are p3ZBB (to generate the short NRS RNA, nt 701–930) (28McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pSP64-SCN4A plasmid was a gift of Adrian Krainer. p3Z-P120 was made by inserting an HindIII-BglII PCR fragment containing the first nt of exon 6 through nt 180 of exon 7 into the HindIII-BamHI sites of pGEM-3Z (Promega). Point mutations in the G tracts of the NRS were made in a version of p3ZkxMS, p3ZMSxma, in which a T residue at NRS nt 939 was converted by overlap PCR to a G to create an XmaI site: the G tract mutations (pMSmG1, pMSmG2, pMSmG3, and pMSmG4) were also made by overlap PCR and are shown in Fig. 5A (primer sequences available upon request). pMSmG1+2 and pMSmG1+3 had the indicated mutations combined. These mutations were also generated in a background where the U1 site in the NRS was mutated (mU1 (30McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), yielding the plasmid series pMSmU1mG1, etc. The 3′ deletion series pMSΔG4, pMSΔG3+4, and pMSΔG2–4 were made by PCR and have the deletions indicated in Fig. 6. The 5′ deletion series, pMSΔG1, pMSΔG1+2, and pMSΔ1–3, were also made by PCR and are depicted in Fig. 7. The mG1, mG2, and mG1+2 mutations were incorporated into a variant of the chimeric expression plasmid pNRS-P120 (30McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which a unique XhoI site was introduced into the intron to facilitate cloning to generate pmG1-P120, pmG2P120, and pmG1+2-P120.Fig. 5Mutation of G tracts 1 and 2 diminishes U11 binding to the NRS.

For pSP64-SCN4A, XbaI was used for full-length RNA that included the U1 site, BstXI to exclude the U1 site, and BsaI for the 5′-half-substrate (sizes shown in Fig. 3); SP6 RNA polymerase was used for these plasmids. All plasmids were transcribed in vitro in the presence of biotin-11-UTP (20% of total UTP). RNAs were incubated under splicing conditions with ATP in HeLa nuclear extract for 20 min at 30 °C (36Cook C.R. McNally M.T. Virology. 1998; 242: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotides to U1 (nt 1–14), U2 (nt 27–49), and U7 (nt 3–20) snRNA were added 15 min prior to addition of biotinylated substrate. For snRNA cleavage, extracts were pretreated for 30 min with the deoxyribonucleotides indicated in the figures at 20 μm and 0.08 unit/μl RNase H (Promega) to degrade snRNAs. Streptavidin-agarose beads were added and mixed at 300 mm KCl for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed extensively at 300 mm KCl. Samples were treated with proteinase K to release bound nucleic acids, which were then phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and separated on an 8 m urea-8% polyacrylamide (19:1) gel. RNA was then electroblotted to a ZetaProbe membrane (Bio-Rad) and hybridized with a riboprobe to U11, U12, or U2 snRNAs and visualized and quantitated using a PhosphorImager.Fig. 3The NRS binds U11 snRNP much more efficiently than authentic 5′ splice sites from P120 and SCN4A genes.

Cells grown to about 40–60% confluence in 6-cm dishes were transfected with 2–3 μg of DNA by the calcium-phosphate method (Amersham Biosciences), and total RNA harvested 40 h later was isolated with Qiagen RNeasy columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reverse transcription-PCR, 1–2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with an antisense primer directed to pRSV2 vectors sequences downstream of the transcription unit (GCAGACACTCTATGCCTGTGTGG) and common to all RNAs in 20 μl using 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the manufacturers recommended reaction conditions. For PCR, 2 μl of the reverse transcription reaction was subjected to 18–25 cycles of PCR as described (30McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and product levels in the linear range were quantitated using an AlphaImager. Alternatively, PCR was performed with a radiolabeled 5′ primer, and products were quantitated on acrylamide gels with a PhosphorImager (with similar results).RESULTSFig. 1 depicts the major features of the NRS, including the upstream SR protein binding sites and important sequences for snRNP binding. The consensus U1 and U11 5′ss sequences are shown over the experimentally determined snRNP binding sites within the NRS. U1 binding to its suboptimal site can be substantially improved by mutating the U11 site, whereas only a modest improvement in U11 binding was observed upon mutation of the U1 site (30McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, U11 binds the NRS very efficiently and out-competes U1. The efficient U11 binding is surprising, because the NRS does not harbor the highly conserved U12-type BP consensus signal, and it is known that efficient U11 binding to bona fide 5′ splice sites requires a corresponding U12-type 3′ss (17Frilander M.J. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).U11 Binding to the NRS Does Not Require U12—Although U11 and U12 snRNPs are thought to exist primarily as a di-snRNP in cells, between 60 and 80% of U11 snRNP exists as a mono-snRNP in extracts while the rest is complexed with U12 (16Wassarman K.M. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1276-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that U11 snRNP binds the NRS as a free snRNP or as a di-snRNP in vitro. To determine if U12 is required for U11 binding to the NRS, U12 snRNA in nuclear extracts was cleaved with oligonucleotides directed toward nt 2–23 (the di-snRNP remains intact) or nt 53–71 (which destroys U12 snRNP and thus, the di-snRNP). U11 binding to the NRS (nt 701–1011) in these extracts was then assessed by affinity selection on biotinylated NRS RNA and Northern blotting for U11 snRNA. As shown in Fig. 2A and consistent with a previous study (16Wassarman K.M. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1276-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), treatment of extract with the U122–23 oligonucleotide cleaved off the 5′ end of U12 snRNA, whereas U1253–71 caused complete degradation (lanes 5 and 6). A control oligonucleotide to U6 snRNA had no effect on U12 snRNA (lane 7). None of the oligonucleotides had an effect on U11 snRNA (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, in untreated extracts NRS RNA selected U11 snRNP well (lane 3), whereas binding to a substrate with mutations at the +6 and +7 positions in the U11 site was very low (lane 2). U11 binding to the NRS was not affected by treatment with the U6 control oligonucleotide (lane 7), nor was there a significant effect upon treatment with either of the U12 oligonucleotides (lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that, in contrast to authentic splicing substrates, U11 snRNP need not be complexed with U12 to bind the NRS.Fig. 2U12 snRNP is not required for U11 binding to the NRS. A, cleavage of U12 snRNP in nuclear extract. Nuclear extract was treated under splicing conditions for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 μm of the indicated oligonucleotide and 0.08 unit/μl RNase H (indicated by + and –), an aliquot was removed, RNA was extracted, subjected to Northern blotting, and the integrity of U12 snRNP was assessed with a U12 probe. B, U11 binding to the NRS in oligonucleotide-inactivated extracts. The extracts described in A were used for affinity selection using non-biotinylated or biotinylated NRS RNA (nt 701–1011), and U11 binding was monitored by Northern blotting with a U11 probe. A representative blot is shown with percentage of NRS signal (by phosphorimaging) below each lane. non, affinity selection with non-biotinylated RNA; 67, the NRS with a mutation in the U11 binding site. The positions of U12 and U11 snRNA are shown to the right. The data are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A G-rich Downstream Element Promotes U11 Binding to the NRS—To determine the efficiency of U11 snRNP binding to the NRS versus authentic minor class 5′ splice sites, biotinylated NRS or P120 5′ss and SCN4A RNAs were subjected to affinity selection. P120 and SCN4A represent two U12-dependent substrates that have been well characterized (12Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Wu Q.

The NRS RNA contained RSV nt 701–1011, the P120 5′ss substrate contained the entire exon 6 through position 66 of the 99 nt intron, and the SCN4A 5′ss RNA included 119 nt of exon (plus 12 nt fr"
https://openalex.org/W2014340969,"The DAF-4 receptor kinase, which promotes larval development, is encoded by a 2.9 kb mRNA transcribed from the only type II TGF-β/BMP receptor gene in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Here we report that alternative polyadenylation in intron 5 of <i>daf-4</i> results in a 2.0 kb mRNA that encodes an open reading frame including only the N-terminal secretion signal and ligand-binding domains, and not the transmembrane or kinase domains, of DAF-4. Northern blots and real-time RT-PCR amplifications using RNA samples from developmentally staged animals show that expression levels of both the 2.9 kb and 2.0 kb transcripts are relatively constant, and their abundances similar, except for the transition between non-dauer and dauer stages. In dauer larvae, the steady-state level of the 2.0 kb mRNA increases more than 10-fold and exceeds the 2.9 kb transcript, coincident with an absence of signaling from DAF-4. Transgenic expression of a recombinant <i>daf-4</i> transgene that encodes only the 2.0 kb mRNA enhances the Daf-c phenotype of a <i>daf-4</i> hypomorph, whereas the same transgene with a nonsense mutation does not. These data suggest that a polypeptide encoded by the 2.0 kb transcript can function as an antagonist of full-length DAF-4 signaling. Alternative processing of type II receptor transcripts to generate an antagonist is a novel mechanism for negative regulation of a TGF-β signaling pathway."
