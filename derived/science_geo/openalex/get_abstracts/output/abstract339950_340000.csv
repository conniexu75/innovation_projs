https://openalex.org/W1973940154,"The development of synthetic methods for oxysulfuranes has made a wide range of isolable compounds of hypervalent sulfur available for study. Structure-reactivity correlations are now becoming evident as a result of such study. The fact that oxygen is dicoordinate makes it possible to synthesize cyclic oxysulfuranes and to use the pronounced changes of reactivity which accompany cyclization to design new, potentially useful sulfurane reagents stable enough to allow isolation."

Energy can be delivered at costs that are competitive now with such high-cost energy sources as much fuel-generated, electrical resistance heating. The technology of heating is being improved through collector developments, improved materials, and studies of new ways to carry out the heating processes. Solar cooling is still in the experimental stage. Relatively few experiments have yielded information on solar operation of absorption coolers, on use of night sky radiation in locations with clear skies, on the combination of a solar-operated Rankine engine and a compression cooler, and on open cycle, humidification-dehumidification systems. Many more possibilities for exploration exist. Solar cooling may benefit from collector developments that permit energy delivery at higher temperatures and thus solar operation of additional kinds of cycles. Improved solar cooling capability can open up new applications of solar energy, particularly for larger buildings, and can result in markets for retrofitting existing buildings. Solar energy for buildings can, in the next decade, make a significant contribution to the national energy economy and to the pocketbooks of many individual users. very large-aggregate enterprises in manufacture, sale, and installation of solar energy equipment can result, which can involve a spectrum of large and small businesses. In our view, the technology is here or will soon be at hand; thus the basic decisions as to whether the United States uses this resource will be political in nature."

These patterns can be understood in the context of the behavior patterns appropriate during each of the different stages of the reproductive cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1984001622,"The mechanisms of the phase transformations between the spinel (gamma) and modified spinel (beta) polymorphs of Mg(2)SiO(4) have been studied experimentally between 15 and 20 gigapascals and 800 degrees to 950 degrees C. The gamma to beta transformation occurs by a shear mechanism, whereas the beta to gamma transformation involves grain-boundary nucleation and interface-controlled growth. These contrasting mechanisms are a consequence of the number of independent slip systems that are available in the respective crystal structures. This result leads to the prediction that in subduction zones and perhaps also rising plumes in the Earth's mantle, the gamma to beta transformation should be accompanied by a transient reduction in strength."
