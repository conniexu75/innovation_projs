https://openalex.org/W1988655325,"Far red and near infrared (NIR) light promotes wound healing, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Our previous studies using 670 nm light-emitting diode (LED) arrays suggest that cytochrome c oxidase, a photoacceptor in the NIR range, plays an important role in therapeutic photobiomodulation. If this is true, then an irreversible inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase, potassium cyanide (KCN), should compete with LED and reduce its beneficial effects. This hypothesis was tested on primary cultured neurons. LED treatment partially restored enzyme activity blocked by 10–100 μm KCN. It significantly reduced neuronal cell death induced by 300 μm KCN from 83.6 to 43.5%. However, at 1–100 mm KCN, the protective effects of LED decreased, and neuronal deaths increased. LED significantly restored neuronal ATP content only at 10 μm KCN but not at higher concentrations of KCN tested. Pretreatment with LED enhanced efficacy of LED during exposure to 10 or 100 μm KCN but did not restore enzyme activity to control levels. In contrast, LED was able to completely reverse the detrimental effect of tetrodotoxin, which only indirectly down-regulated enzyme levels. Among the wavelengths tested (670, 728, 770, 830, and 880 nm), the most effective ones (830 nm, 670 nm) paralleled the NIR absorption spectrum of oxidized cytochrome c oxidase, whereas the least effective wavelength, 728 nm, did not. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that the mechanism of photobiomodulation involves the up-regulation of cytochrome c oxidase, leading to increased energy metabolism in neurons functionally inactivated by toxins.

Lanzafame R.J. Lasers Surg. Med. 1997; 20: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). NIR light penetrates more deeply than UV or visible light and is benign to living tissue. This presents clear clinical advantages to treatment within a tissue transparency window of 650–1000 nm. Most of the devices utilize lasers as the light source. Recently, however, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been found to be more beneficial than lasers in several respects (3Whelan H.T. Smits Jr., R.L. Buchman E.V. Whelan N.T. Turner S.G. Margolis D.A. Cevenini V. Stinson H. Ignatius R. Martin T. Cwiklinski J. Philippi A.F. Graf W.R. Hodgson B. Gould L. Kane M. Chen G. Caviness J. J. Clin. Laser Med.

Clin. Laser Med. Surg. 2002; 20: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). LEDs can be constructed to form relatively large arrays to treat wounds that commonly involve areas much larger than the size of a laser beam. Unlike lasers, there is virtually no heat generated by the LED array and therefore no potential thermal injury to individuals being treated. LED is well tolerated by biological tissues and has no known detrimental effect. As a therapeutic device, LED has achieved FDA non-significant risk status. Moreover, LED units are more compact, portable, and affordable than lasers. The cellular mechanisms of action of NIR in wound healing are not well understood. The basic premise is that long wavelength lights stimulate cellular energy metabolism and energy production. Three major photoacceptor molecules in mammalian tissues are known to absorb light in the NIR range: hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome c oxidase. Of the three, only cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) has been associated with energy production. In our recent study, the first two candidates were excluded in our primary neuronal cultures in which more than 95% of the cells were neurons, and there were no blood elements or muscle cells (6Wong-Riley M.T. Bai X. Buchmann E. Whelan H.T. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the presence of a voltage-dependent sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), which impedes neuronal impulse activity, decreases ATP demand, and down-regulates cytochrome c oxidase activity, LED at 670 nm was able to reverse the detrimental effect of TTX by bringing cytochrome c oxidase back to control levels. Moreover, LED treatment up-regulated enzyme activity of normal neurons above control levels (6Wong-Riley M.T. Bai X. Buchmann E. Whelan H.T. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The beneficial effect of NIR was further confirmed in our recent in vivo study. Rats intoxicated with methanol developed retinal dysfunction attributable to the inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by formic acid, the toxic metabolite in methanol intoxication. Three brief LED treatments significantly improved retinal function as measured by the electroretinographic response and protected the retina from histopathological changes induced by methanol-derived formate (7Eells J.T. Henry M.M. Summerfelt P. Wong-Riley M.T. Buchmann E.V. Kane M. Whelan N.T. Whelan H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3439-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, photobiomodulation is therapeutic in restoring visual functions after reversible inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by formate. Our in vitro and in vivo studies thus far suggest that cytochrome c oxidase plays an important role in the therapeutic process of photobiomodulation. A comparison of the action spectrum for cellular proliferation following laser photoirradiation with the absorption spectra of potential photoacceptors led Karu (8Karu T. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1999; 49: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) to suggest that cytochrome c oxidase is a primary photoacceptor of light in the far red to near infrared region. Britton Chance's group postulated that ∼50% of near infrared light is absorbed by mitochondrial chromophores such as cytochrome c oxidase (9Beauvoit B. Kitai T. Chance B. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2501-2510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To further investigate this question, the present study tested the following hypotheses: 1) cytochrome c oxidase is directly involved in the photobiomodulation reaction; therefore, a potent and irreversible inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase such as potassium cyanide (KCN) will compete with and lessen the beneficial effect of LED. 2) LED treatment stimulates cytochrome c oxidase activity in neurons; therefore, LED pretreatment will further enhance the partial protective action of LED during exposure to KCN. 3) By increasing cytochrome c oxidase activity and cellular energetics, LED will reduce neuronal cell death caused by the cytotoxin KCN. Finally, 4) the effective action spectrum of LED in reversing the detrimental effect of the impulse blocker tetrodotoxin on cytochrome c oxidase activity should correspond to the NIR absorption spectrum of cytochrome c oxidase. Various wavelengths of LED were tested to see if specific ones were more beneficial to functionally inactivated neurons. Wavelengths were administered either singly or in combination to determine the optimal conditions for treatment. Primary neuronal cultures were again our model system because (a) primary neurons are more physiological than cell lines, (b) neurons are highly oxidative, and (c) experimental conditions can be manipulated to affect neurons without complications from other cell types. LED arrays (25 × 10 cm) with peak wavelengths at 670, 728, 770, 830, or 880 nm were obtained from Quantum Devices, Inc. (Barnaveld, WI). ATP releasing reagent, bioluminescent somatic cell assay kit, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, equine heart cytochrome c, luciferase ATP assay mix, and tetrodotoxin were from Sigma. Potassium cyanide was from Fisher. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. The general protocol for culturing neurons from postnatal rat visual cortex was as described previously (10Goslin K. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 251-281Google Scholar, 11Zhang C. Wong-Riley M. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, a glial feeder layer from postnatal 1–2-day-old rat cortex was cultured in 60-mm dishes. After 2 weeks, when this layer was subconfluent visual cortical neurons from postnatal 1–3-day-old rats were cultured on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. Cytosine arabinoside was added 1 day after plating of neurons to inhibit the replication of non-neuronal cells. Neurons were co-cultured with glial cells but were physically separated from them by wax spheres. Sister cultures at 5 days of age were exposed to 10 μm, 100 μm, 1 mm, 10 mm, or 100 mm KCN for 5 days. All cell studies were done in covered Petri dishes to avoid evaporation of hydrogen cyanide. As a corollary to the KCN experiments, another set of sister cultures were exposed to 10 μm, 100 μm, and 1 mm of sodium azide (NaN3) for 5 days. TTX, a blocker of voltage-dependent sodium channels, was added to sister cultures at 5 days of age at a final concentration of 0.4 μm, and cultures were maintained in such media for 6 days. TTX was replenished twice a week. Controls had no TTX. GaAlAs light emitting diode arrays of five different wavelengths were used: 670, 728, 770, 830, and 880 nm, each with a bandwidth of 25–30 nm at 50% power. The power intensity chosen was 50 milliwatt/cm2 (unless otherwise indicated), and energy density was 4 joules/cm2 when applied for 1 min and 20 s (6Wong-Riley M.T. Bai X. Buchmann E. Whelan H.T. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). KCN Experiments—Five sets of sister cultures, each exposed to one of five KCN concentrations, were treated with LED at 670 nm and energy density of 4 joules/cm2 twice a day on each of the 5 days of exposure to KCN. One set of normal controls had neither KCN nor LED. A second set of controls had KCN but no LED. Pretreatment Experiments—Four sets of sister cultures were pretreated with LED at 670 nm and energy density of 4 joules/cm2 (= 1 min and 20 s exposure) once a day for 3 days or 5 days before being exposed to either 10 or 100 μm of KCN for 5 days, during which they received LED treatment as described above. Ten groups were tested: (i) normal controls, (ii) pretreatment with LED for 3 days followed by 10 μm of KCN plus LED, (iii) 10 μm of KCN plus LED without pretreatment, (iv) pretreatment with LED for 3 days followed by 100 μm of KCN plus LED, and (v) 100 μm of KCN plus LED without pretreatment. Groups (vi) to (x) were the same as the above, except that groups (vii) and (ix) each had 5 days of pretreatment. Varying Single Wavelength Experiments—Five sets of sister cultures, each exposed to TTX for 6 days, were treated with one of the five wavelengths (670, 728, 770, 830, and 880 nm) at a power intensity of 50 milliwatt/cm2 and energy density of 4 joules/cm2 for 1 min and 20 s per day for the last 5 of the 6 days grown in the presence of TTX. One set of normal controls had neither TTX nor LED. A second set of controls had TTX but no LED. Varying Multiple Wavelengths Experiments—To determine whether the sequence of wavelengths, power intensities, or number of treatments affect cytochrome c oxidase activity in TTX-intoxicated neurons as compared with single wavelength treatment, eight sets of sister cultures (a–h) were each exposed to TTX for 6 days and were treated with LED of specified sequences of wavelengths as follows: (a), 670 nm → 728 nm → 830 nm; (b), 670 nm → 830 nm → 728 nm; (c), 728 nm → 670 nm → 830 nm; (d), 728 nm → 830 nm → 670 nm; (e), 830 nm → 670 nm → 728 nm; (f) 830 nm → 728 nm → 670 nm. For groups (a)–(f), each wavelength had a power intensity of 50 milliwatt/cm2 and energy density of 4 joules/cm2. Each group was exposed to a sequence of three wavelengths as indicated once a day for the last five of the 6 days of exposure to TTX. (g), 670 nm (50 milliwatt/cm2) → 728 nm (50 milliwatt/cm2) → 830 nm (50 milliwatt/cm2) →; 670 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2) → 728 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2) → 830 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2) →; 670 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2) → 728 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2)→ 830 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2); (h), 670 nm (50 milliwatt/cm2) → 728 nm (50 milliwatt/cm2) → 880 nm (50 milliwatt/cm2) →; 670 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2) → 728 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2) → 880 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2) →; 670 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2) → 728 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2) → 880 nm (10 milliwatt/cm2). Groups g and h were each treated with a sequence of nine wavelengths at the indicated power intensities, each of which was exposed for a length of time corresponding to an energy density of 4 joules/cm2. All nine treatments were performed in sequence on the same day, which was 5 days after TTX exposure, and cells were harvested 24 h after each of the last (9th) treatment. Control cultures were not exposed to TTX or to LED treatment. Cytochrome c oxidase reactions were performed concurrently for control and experimental cultures in an incubation medium containing 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.03% cytochrome c in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (6Wong-Riley M.T. Bai X. Buchmann E. Whelan H.T. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Zhang C. Wong-Riley M. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Wong-Riley M. Brain Res. 1979; 171: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). Sister cultures from all the test groups, except for the pretreatment groups, were analyzed for ATP content by means of the luciferin-luciferase luminometry, using a modification of the luminescence method of Strehler (13Strehler B.L. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1968; 16: 99-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and components of the bioluminescent somatic cell assay kit. Briefly, cultured cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated in cold somatic cell ATP releasing reagent for 5 min, and harvested from the coverslips by means of a cell scraper. They were then mixed with the luciferase ATP assay mix and assayed with a luminometer (LB 9506). Values were expressed as nanomolar ATP content per milligram of protein. The ratio of normal to neurons undergoing cell death were assessed with propidium iodide staining in methanol-permeabilized cells according to the method of Cebers et al. (14Cebers G. Zhivotovsky B. Ankarcrona M. Liljequist S. Brain Res. Bull. 1997; 43: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated three times. The frequency of neurons with intensely fluorescent, condensed chromatin (indicating cell death) was determined from the total number of cells counted in each of normal controls (n = 3,430), 100 μm KCN (n = 2,678), or 300 μm KCN (n = 3,825) exposure for 28 h and pretreatment with 670 nm LED (at 50 milliwatt/cm2 and 30 joules/cm2 for 10 min) before exposure to 28 h of 100 μm (n = 2,144) or 300 μm KCN (n = 2,572). A second inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase, NaN3, was also tested at concentrations of 100 μm, 300 μm, and 1 mm and with the same regimen of pretreatment. To quantitatively analyze changes in cytochrome c oxidase activity following KCN or TTX exposure and LED treatment, optical densities of reaction product in individual cells from all of the above experiments were measured by means of a Zeiss Zonax MPM 03 photometer (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) attached to a Zeiss compound microscope. Multiple, two micron spot size readings were taken from the cytoplasm of each cell. Between 150 and 300 cells were measured from each group (representing each bar of each histogram) using a ×25 objective lens. The background was subtracted by setting zero over a blank area (without cells) in each slide, and all lighting conditions, magnifications, and reference points were kept constant. Two-tailed Student's t test for paired comparisons and analysis of variance for group comparisons was used to analyze differences between and among treated and untreated groups. Comparisons of each paradigm with every other paradigm within each group were also analyzed by the Tukey test. Values were expressed as mean ± S.E. A probability of 0.05 or less was considered significant. KCN Experiments—As described previously (6Wong-Riley M.T. Bai X. Buchmann E. Whelan H.T. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Zhang C. Wong-Riley M. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), cultured neurons were divided into three broad metabolic types: dark, moderate, and lightly reactive for cytochrome c oxidase. The goal was to determine whether different metabolic types would respond differently to toxins and LED. After KCN intoxication, the activity of cytochrome c oxidase was reduced in all cells, and reaction product in dark, moderate, and lightly reactive neurons all shifted toward lower optical densitometric values. As shown in Figs. 1, A and B, and 2A, KCN treatment resulted in a significant reduction in cytochrome c oxidase activity of primary neurons even at the 10 μm concentration (p < 0.001). Increasing concentrations of KCN from 10 μm to 100 mm caused progressively greater decline in enzyme activity and neuronal viability.Fig. 1Primary visual cortical neurons in culture. Neurons were broadly classified into darkly (D), moderately (M), and lightly (L) reactive categories for cytochrome c oxidase (arrows). A, normal control. B, neurons exposed to 10 μm KCN for 5 days. C, neurons were treated twice daily with 670 nm LED while being exposed to 10 μm of KCN for 5 days. D, neurons pretreated with 670 nm LED for 3 days before being exposed to 10 μm KCN for 5 days, during which LED treatment was continued twice daily.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LED treatment at 670 nm (energy density of 4 joules/cm2 when exposed for 1 min and 20 s) twice a day for each of the 5 days of exposure to lower concentrations of KCN (10–100 μm) significantly reversed the detrimental effect of the toxin on cytochrome c oxidase activity (p < 0.001 for all three metabolic neuronal types). However, these reversals were complete only for the lightly reactive neurons but less than complete for the dark and moderately reactive neurons (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001, respectively, as compared with controls) (Figs. 1C and 2A). At higher concentrations of KCN (1–100 mm), increasing neuronal death and decreasing benefits from the LED were observed for all three metabolic cell types (Fig. 2A). Results of 100 mm KCN were not plotted because most of the cells did not survive at that concentration. Sister cultures exposed to NaN3 at various concentrations (10 μm, 100 μm, and 1 mm) resulted in progressively greater reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity (data not shown). In comparison to KCN, a higher concentration of NaN3 was needed to achieve the same level of inhibition. LED treatment partially reversed the inhibition but not to control levels (data not shown), again comparable to the findings with KCN. Cellular ATP concentrations showed trends similar to those of cytochrome c oxidase in response to KCN or LED (Fig. 2B). However, LED treatment was able to reverse the effect of only the lowest concentration of KCN tested (10 μm) but not at concentrations of 100 μm or higher. The ATP content in cells subjected to 10 mm KCN was below the detection limit of the ATP assay, and LED treatment had little or no effect. Again, too few cells survived at 100 mm KCN for accurate determination of ATP content. Pretreatment Experiments—Pretreatment with LED at 670 nm (energy density of 4 joules/cm2, equivalent to 1 min and 20 s exposure), once a day for 3 days provided additional protection for visual cortical neurons that received LED treatment (twice a day) during their 5-day exposure to 10 or 100 μm of KCN (Figs. 1D and 3A). It significantly improved the level of cytochrome c oxidase activity in darkly and moderately reactive metabolic cell types above those provided by LED treatment during KCN exposure (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001). However, the values were still significantly below those of normal controls (p < 0.001 for all). Pretreatment did not appear to have additional benefit for the lightly reactive metabolic group. Higher concentrations of KCN were not tested. Pretreatment with the same paradigm once a day for 5 days further increased cytochrome c oxidase activity in neurons that received LED during exposure to 10 μm or 100 μm of KCN (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). However, their values were still significantly lower than those of normal controls for each of the metabolic cell types (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001). Again, pretreatment did not provide further benefit for the lightly reactive cell group that received LED during exposure to 100 μm KCN. Propidium Iodide DNA Staining of Neurons Undergoing Cell Death—The extent of cell death in various cultures and the effect of LED were evaluated with propidium iodide staining. Nuclei of intact cells had typical dispersed chromatin morphology, whereas neurons undergoing cell death had condensed, small, and intensely fluorescent nuclei with chromatin aggregates. As shown in Fig. 4A, control cultures had very few apoptotic nuclei (4.75% of total cell population). This number remained low at 100 μm KCN (9.3%) and was not different from that of pretreatment with 10 min of LED (9.28%) (data not shown). Higher concentrations of KCN resulted in increasing proportions of neurons with condensed chromatin. Cultures subjected to 300 μm KCN for 28 h showed a profusion of neurons with highly condensed chromatin (83.6%) (Fig. 4B). Significantly, 10 min of LED pretreatment at 670 nm (equivalent to 30 joules/cm2 of energy density) substantially reduced the number of neurons with condensed chromatin to 43.47% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4C). Replacement of KCN with NaN3 at 1 mm concentration generated 73.7% of neurons with condensed chromatin, and pretreatment with LED for 10 min significantly reduced the percentage of neurons undergoing cell death to 51.6% (p < 0.001). For comparison, the Hoechst stain showed comparable number of cell death with 300 μm KCN and comparable reduction in cell death with LED (data not shown). Varying Single Wavelength Experiments—To determine the optimal wavelength for reversing the detrimental effect of TTX on neuronal cytochrome c oxidase activity, five wavelengths were tested: 670, 728, 770, 830, and 880 nm. Each was administered at a power intensity of 50 milliwatt/cm2 and energy density of 4 joules/cm2 equivalent to 1 min and 20 s per day for the last 5 of the 6 days of TTX exposure. As shown in Fig. 5A, 670 and 830 nm were equally effective in reversing the deleterious effect of TTX on cytochrome c oxidase activity, with 830 nm being the most beneficial in completely restoring enzyme activity to slightly above (although not statistically different from) control levels (111.7%). 670 nm was equally effective in bringing about 100% recovery. Although 770 nm was as beneficial as 880 nm toward the darkly reactive metabolic cell type, overall it enabled 67.2% recovery of enzyme levels, whereas 880 nm brought about 98.4% recovery for all metabolic cell types. 728 nm, on the other hand, was the least effective and could only bring about 27.5% recovery of enzyme activity in TTX-intoxicated neurons. The ATP content of neurons was reduced to 82.5% of control levels by 6 days of exposure to 0.4 μm of TTX (Fig. 5B). All LED treatments except for 728 nm were able to completely reverse the detrimental trend. Again, 830 nm appeared to be very effective in restoring ATP content to slightly above (although not significantly different from) control levels (106.8%). 670 nm also restored the ATP content to a level above (but statistically comparable to) control levels (110%). Both 770 and 880 nm were effective in bringing ATP content to 98.4% and 91.5% of control levels, respectively. On the other hand, 728 nm was the least effective and showed minimal benefit in reversing the detrimental effect of TTX (to only 86.2% of controls, comparable to the value of TTX alone). Varying Multiple Wavelengths Experiments—To determine whether certain sequences of wavelengths would be more beneficial than others, we tested six different sequences of three wavelengths, each given once a day for the last 5 of 6 days in TTX, all at the same energy density of 4 joules/cm2 (see “Experimental Procedures” for groups (a–f)). Results indicated that all combinations tested resulted in cytochrome c oxidase levels above those of controls (p < 0.001 for all) (Fig. 6A). Cellular ATP content also showed the benefit of all combinations tested with values at or slightly above control levels (Fig. 6B). The last two groups of neurons each had a sequence of nine LED treatments, all on the last day of a 6-day TTX exposure and were harvested 24 h later. Group (g) was treated sequentially with LEDs at 670, 728, and 830 nm at 50 milliwatt/cm2 each for the first round and at 10 milliwatt/cm2 each for the second and third rounds. Group (h) was similar to group (g) except that 830 nm was replaced by 880 nm LED (see “Experimental Procedures”). The energy density was kept constant at 4 J/cm2 for each treatment to determine whether varying the power intensities would make a difference. Results indicated that both paradigms completely reversed the detrimental effect of TTX on cytochrome c oxidase activity, with group (g) reversing the darkly reactive cell type above control levels (Fig. 7A). The cellular ATP content showed the same trend with both paradigms reaching control levels (Fig. 7B). Action Spectra versus Cytochrome c Oxidase Absorption Spectrum—The action spectra of cytochrome c oxidase activity and ATP content of neurons responding to various wavelengths were plotted against reported absorption spectrum of the enzyme (15Cooper C.E. Springett R. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1997; 352: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, the effective wavelengths, especially 670 and 830 nm, correlated positively with the known absorption spectrum of oxidized cytochrome c oxidase. On the other hand, the least effective wavelength, 728 nm, did not correspond to the absorption spectrum of the enzyme. Equilibrium Constants of Cyanide and Azide with Cytochrome c Oxidase—Fig. 9 illustrates the equilibrium constants of cyanide (A) and azide (B) with cytochrome c oxidase with or without LED treatment. The cyanide data were for darkly reactive neurons as shown in Fig. 2A, and the azide data were for all three metabolic cell types from our unpublished observations. The cyanide concentrations plotted were 10 μm, 100 μm, 1 mm, and 10 mm, whereas those for azide were 10 μm, 100 μm, and 1 mm.

https://openalex.org/W2088514277,"Oct-3/4 is a key transcriptional factor whose expression level governs the fate of primitive inner cell mass and embryonic stem (ES) cells. Previously, an upstream 3.3-kb distal enhancer (DE) fragment was identified to be responsible for the specific expression of mouse Oct-3/4 in the inner cell mass and ES cells. However, little is known about the cis-elements and trans-factors required for DE activity. In this study, we identified a novel cis-element, called Site 2B here, located ∼30 bp downstream from Site 2A, which was previously revealed in DE by an in vivo chemical modification experiment. Using the luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that both Site 2A and Site 2B are necessary and sufficient for activating DE in the contexts of both the native Oct-3/4 promoter and the heterologous thymidine kinase minimal promoter. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay we showed that Site 2B specifically binds to Oct-3/4 and Sox2 when ES-derived cell extracts were used, whereas Site 2A binds to a factor(s) present in both ES and NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, we showed that the physiological level of Oct-3/4 in ES cells is required for Site 2B-mediated DE activity using the inducible knock-out system of Oct-3/4 in ES cells. These results indicate that Oct-3/4 is a member of the gene family regulated by Oct-3/4 and Sox2, as reported before for the FGF-4, UTF1, Sox2, and Fbx15 genes. Thus, Oct-3/4 and Sox2 comprise a regulatory complex that controls the expression of genes important for the maintenance of the primitive state, including themselves. This autoregulatory circuit of the Sox2·Oct-3/4 complex may contribute to maintaining robustly the precise expression level of Oct-3/4 in primitive cells.

Totipotent cells are defined by their ability to produce both somatic and germ cells as well as extraembryonic tissues in mammals. The maintenance of totipotent cells lies at the heart of the continuity of life from one generation to the next. Although the molecular mechanism ensuring the totipotency in cells, in other words, preventing differentiation to a specific lineage of cells, is not fully understood, several key molecules have been identified. The transcription factor Oct-3/4 (encoded by the Pou5f1 locus) is one of such molecules and has been studied extensively (1Rosner M.H. Vigano M.A. Ozato K. Timmons P.M. Poirier F. Rigby P.W.

Oct-3/4 protein is present in the nuclei of the eight-cell embryo and all cells in the subsequent morula stage. When the embryos develop into the blastocyst, the trophectoderm is formed in the outer layer of the embryos as the first cell lineage specification. Oct-3/4 expression is extinguished in the trophectodermal cells, whereas it is continued in the inner cell mass (ICM) 1The abbreviations used are: ICM, inner cell mass; DE, distal enhancer; EC, embryonic carcinoma; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ES, embryonic stem; HA, hemagglutinin; luc, luciferase; nt, nucleotide; PE, proximal enhancer; RA, retinoic acid; Tc, tetracycline; TK, thymidine kinase.1The abbreviations used are: ICM, inner cell mass; DE, distal enhancer; EC, embryonic carcinoma; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ES, embryonic stem; HA, hemagglutinin; luc, luciferase; nt, nucleotide; PE, proximal enhancer; RA, retinoic acid; Tc, tetracycline; TK, thymidine kinase. that maintains the pluripotency to generate nontrophoblast extraembryonic tissues and all fetal cell types including germ cells. After implantation, Oct-3/4 expression is observed in the epiblast, which is subsequently down-regulated during gastrulation. In the later stages, Oct-3/4 is expressed only in primordial germ cells. In vitro, Oct-3/4 is expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and is down-regulated when these cells are induced to differentiate by retinoic acid (RA) treatment or the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor (2Okamoto K. Okazawa H. Okuda A. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Hamada H. Cell. 1990; 60: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 7Palmieri S.L. Peter W. Hess H. Scholer H.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These remarkable expression patterns of Oct-3/4 during early mouse development and the undifferentiated cell lines suggest that Oct-3/4 plays an important role in maintaining the toti- or pluripotency of cells. The essentiality of Oct-3/4 in producing totipotent cells was demonstrated by the gene targeting technique. Oct-3/4-deficient knock-out embryos develop to the blastocyst stage, but the internally existing cells that form the pluripotent ICM cells in wild-type blastocysts are differentiated into the trophectoderm lineage, and no ICM cell is established (9Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Scholer H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2671) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the Oct-3/4 gene was knocked-down by the small interfering RNA method in early mouse development (10Kim M.H. Yuan X. Okumura S. Ishikawa F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1372-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Oct-3/4 does not simply control the pluripotency in a binary on-off fashion; rather, the precise level of Oct-3/4 determines the fate of ES cells (11Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). A less than 2-fold increase from the normal expression level causes differentiation into ectoderm and mesoderm, whereas a reduction to less than 50% leads to dedifferentiation into trophectoderm. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the mechanism controlling Oct-3/4 expression in a quantitative manner. Oct-3/4 is a member of the POU (for Pit, Oct, and Unc) family of transcription factors. The POU family proteins share the POU domain, which is a bipartite DNA binding domain consisting of the ∼75-amino acid POU-specific domain (POUS) and the ∼60-amino acid POU homeodomain (POUH). These two subdomains, connected by a variable linker region, form independent structures and individually make sequence-specific contacts to cognate DNA target sequences. The spatial combination of the two DNA binding subdomains provides a particular POU protein with the overall specificity and affinity for DNA binding and probably interaction with other proteins, such as coactivators. In this respect, the POU proteins can be viewed as intramolecularly fused heterodimers composed of POUS and POUH. However, the binding specificity of the POU proteins is not strict; they recognize a diverse set of DNA sequences (12Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Oct proteins comprise a subfamily of the POU family and bind to the octamer motif, the consensus sequence of which is ATGCAAAT. POUS and POUH bind to the two halves of the consensus sequence, ATGC and AAAT, respectively (13Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Oct-3/4 regulates several genes, including FGF-4, UTF1, Sox2, Fbx15, Rex-1 and osteopontin, through distinct mechanisms (14Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Meno C. Sato M. Hirota Y. Nagamatsu S. Ikeda M. Hamada H.

Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For example, the osteopontin enhancer is characterized by the presence of an octamer sequence and a nearby copy of a palindromic POUH-recognized sequence. Oct-3/4 binds to these motifs to activate the gene as a monomer or a dimer (16Botquin V. Hess H. Fuhrmann G. Anastassiadis C. Gross M.K. Vriend G. Scholer H.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2073-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, Oct-3/4 frequently activates its target genes synergistically with a heterologous transcription factor, Sox2. The FGF-4 gene, which is expressed in ICM and essential for the survival of postimplantation mouse embryo (21Feldman B. Poueymirou W. Papaioannou V.E. DeChiara T. Goldfar M. Science. 1995; 267: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), is the first gene demonstrated to be regulated by Oct-3/4 and Sox2 (15Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1996; 9: 2635-2645Crossref Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The FGF-4 enhancer in the untranslated region of exon 3 consists of a closely juxtaposed Oct-3/4 binding site and Sox2 binding site (15Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1996; 9: 2635-2645Crossref Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 22Dailey L. Yuan H. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7758-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sox factors are a family of transcriptional factors characterized by the presence of an ∼80-amino acid Sry-related high mobility group domain, and Sox2 is specifically expressed in undifferentiated cells and several differentiated cells (23Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Oct-3/4 and Sox2 form a complex that cooperatively recognizes the bipartite Oct-3/4- and Sox2-binding elements present in the FGF-4 enhancer. It has been proposed that the combinatorial recognition of the bipartite cis-elements confers the specificity of the interacting trans-factors on the target gene. FGF-4, however, is not a unique target of the Sox2·Oct-3/4 complex. At least three other genes, UTF1, Fbx15, and Sox2 itself, are regulated by the Sox2·Oct-3/4 (18Nishimoto M. Fukushima A. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5453-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 20Tomioka M. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 24Tokuzawa Y. Kaiho E. Maruyama M. Takahashi K. Mitsui K. Maeda M. Niwa H. Yamanaka S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2699-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these target genes are also expressed in pluripotent cells, and thus it is speculated that the Sox2·Oct-3/4 complex plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation in pluripotent cells. Because the specific expression of Oct-3/4 during early mouse development is required for the correct maintenance of pluripotent cells, the regulatory control of the Oct-3/4 expression has been studied extensively. Previous studies identified two upstream regions, proximal enhancer (PE) and distal enhancer (DE), as the cis-elements controlling Oct-3/4 expression in different types of mouse cells. DE is responsible for activating Oct-3/4 in ICM cells, ES cells and primordial germ cells, whereas PE is functional in the epiblast and EC cells (8Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Scholer H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the significance of these two regions in vivo has been well established, the molecular basis of the enhancer activity remains to be clarified. Here, we studied the cis-elements important for DE activity and found that Oct-3/4 and Sox2 activate Oct-3/4 expression by binding to a novel cis-element identified in DE. Cell Culture—NIH 3T3 and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1× Antibiotic-Antibiotics (Invitrogen). D3 ES cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1× nonessential amino acids, 1× Antibiotic-Antibiotics, and 100 units/ml murine leukemia inhibitory factor (ESGRO, Chemicon, CA) on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes. For differentiation experiments, ES cells were treated with 1 μm all-trans-RA (Sigma) in the same medium without leukemia inhibitory factor and harvested at different time points for protein extraction. ZHBTc4 ES cells were cultured according to Niwa et al. (25Niwa H. Masui S. Chambers I. Smith A.G. Miyazaki J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Cloning of Mouse Genomic Oct-3/4 DNA—A bacterial artificial chromosome library constructed from the ES-129/SvJ mouse strain (Genome Systems) was screened for clones containing the Pou5f1 locus by PCR detection of Oct-3/4 exons 1 and 4. The PCR primers used were: 5′-ATG GCT GGA CAC CTG GCT TC-3′ and 5′-CGG CAC TTC AAC CTC TTC CA-3′ for exons 1a and 1b, respectively; and 5′-ATG CAA ATC GGA GAC CCT GG-3′ and 5′-GGA GAC AAG GGC AGT GAC GA-3′ for exons 4a and 4b, respectively. An ∼23-kb SpeI/SalI fragment containing the Oct-3/4 gene was subcloned into pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene). An ∼4-kb upstream sequence of the gene was sequenced. Plasmid Construction—A series of deletion mutants of the upstream region of the Oct-3/4 gene was constructed by PCR from the 23-kb SpeI/SalI fragment. For reporter assays, the mutant fragments were inserted into the pGL3-Basic plasmid (Promega) or the pGL3-TK plasmid. pGL3-TK contains the minimal promoter of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) gene derived from pBLCAT5. Mouse Oct-3/4 and Sox2 cDNAs were generated by PCR from mRNA derived from undifferentiated R1 ES cells, modified to produce N-terminally HA-tagged protein, and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by ABI sequencers. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells (1 or 5 × 104 cells) were plated on a 12-well plate. 24 h later, 100 ng of reporter plasmids along with 10 ng of the pGL3-RL/TK control plasmid was transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 2 days after the transfection, luciferase activities were measured with the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). In Vitro Translation—Recombinant proteins were produced in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega). Antibodies—Antibodies were derived as follows: anti-Oct-3/4 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Dr. H. Hamada, Osaka University. Anti-Sox2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Drs. Y. Kamachi and H. Kondo, Osaka University. Anti-actin, anti-GATA-4 and anti-normal-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-HA antibody was from Sigma. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Oligonucleotide probes in 1× annealing buffer (10× annealing buffer is 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm MgCl2, and 500 mm NaCl) were heated at 85 °C for 5 min and then gradually cooled to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides were digested with BamHI overnight. The concentrations of the probes were adjusted to 1 μg/μl. 30 μg of whole cell extracts was first incubated with 6 μg of herring sperm DNA or 0.5 μg of poly(dG-dC) as nonspecific competitors in 23 μlof1× binding buffer (5× binding buffer contains 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm MgCl2, 50% glycerol, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 3.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× Complete) with or without antibodies, and then incubated on ice for 10 min (for the simple EMSA) or 1 h (for the antibody supershift experiments). In the supershift experiments, 3 μg of the antibody was included in the reaction. Then, 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes were added to the reaction, and the incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (1× TBE contains 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). The electrophoresis was conducted by applying 200 V to 15 × 15-cm gels for 90 min at 4 °C. The gels were allowed to dry, and then the signals were detected by autoradiography. Oct-3/4 DE Regulates ES-specific Activity of the Gene—To dissect the potential elements present in DE, we performed the reporter assay using the luciferase gene. First, we constructed a plasmid containing the 4.8-kb upstream region of the mouse Oct-3/4 gene (the upstream end corresponds to the XhoI site at nt –4760; the numbering of nucleotides in this study is according to Ref. 26Nordhoff V. Hubner K. Bauer A. Orlova I. Malapetsa A. Scholer H.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, i.e. the position relative to the translational start site) fused with the luciferase gene (pOct4.8-luc, Fig. 1A). In this construct, the initiation codon of the luciferase gene was precisely overlapped with that of the Oct-3/4 gene so that the native TATA-less Oct-3/4 promoter was used for transcribing the reporter. Previously, it was demonstrated that DE and PE are contained, respectively, in the 3.29-kb and 1.39-kb BamHI restriction fragments (Fig. 1A) (8Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Scholer H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because pOct4.8-luc contains both BamHI fragments, it was expected that pOct4.8-luc recapitulates the expression pattern of the Oct-3/4 gene in vivo. We transfected this plasmid into terminally differentiated NIH 3T3 cells and undifferentiated D3 ES cells, together with the control reporter plasmid containing the Renilla reniformis luciferase. The control plasmid served as an internal control for calibrating transfection efficiency. When the luciferase expression level shown by pBasic-luc, which does not possess a promoter, was set at 1 unit, the activity shown by pOct4.8-luc was 23.7 in D3, but 0.3 in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1A). These results reproduced those of a previous study (8Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Scholer H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrated that pOct4.8-luc contains the region necessary for the activation of the Oct-3/4 gene in ES cells and for the repression in NIH 3T3 cells. PE is neither sufficient nor necessary for the Oct-3/4 expression in ES cells, whereas DE is (8Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Scholer H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first wished to narrow down the cis-elements responsible for the DE activity and examined a series of reporter plasmids containing various lengths of deletion from the upstream end (pOct3.0-luc, nt –3020; pOct2.9-luc, nt –2861; pOct2.6-luc, nt –2580; pOct2.4-luc, nt –2421; pOct2.2-luc, nt –2173; pOct2.1-luc, nt –2136; pOct1.9-luc, nt –1938; and pOct1.3-luc, nt –1280; Fig. 1B). When the luciferase activity elicited by pOct4.8-luc in D3 cells was set at 100%, similar levels of transcription were observed for plasmids pOct3.0-luc, pOct2.9-luc, pOct2.6-luc, pOct2.4-luc, pOct2.2-luc, and pOct2.1-luc (Fig. 1B). These plasmids have in common the region –2136/–1. However, additional deletions of up to –1938 (pOct1.9-luc) and to –1280 (pOct1.3-luc) resulted in a significant reduction of the transcription level (bars 9 and 10). These results indicated that the region –2136/–1939 is essential for DE activity. A sequence of CCCCTCCCCCC (–2080/–2070) was identified previously in DE as a region protected in vivo from chemical modification specifically in Oct-3/4-expressing EC and ES cells (27Minucci S. Botquin V. Yeom Y.I. Dey A. Sylvester I. Zand D.J. Ohbo K. Ozato K. Scholer H.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 888-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this sequence, called Site 2A, is within the region –2136/–1939. To examine whether Site 2A is important for DE activity, we constructed another set of upstream deletion mutants focusing on the sequence around Site 2A (Fig. 1C). Upstream deletions of up to –2082 did not result in a notable reduction in the enhancer activity compared with pOct4.8-luc (Fig. 1C, bars 2–8). However, an additional deletion of up to –2078 reduced the activity significantly (∼50%). The deletion of up to –2078 resulted in the partial removal of Site 2A. When Site 2A was further (–2075, –2072) or completely (–2069) removed, the enhancer activity was also reduced gradually (bars 9–12). Site 2A was originally noted to have the sequence motif CCCTCCCCC, which was first identified in PE and called Site 1A (nt –1171/–1163) (27Minucci S. Botquin V. Yeom Y.I. Dey A. Sylvester I. Zand D.J. Ohbo K. Ozato K. Scholer H.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 888-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Okazawa H. Okamoto K. Ishino F. Ishino-Kaneko T. Takeda S. Toyoda Y. Muramatsu M. Hamada H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). CCCTCCCC is a consensus sequence of the Sp1/Sp3 binding site, and these sequences in Sites 2A and 1A are conserved in the human, mouse, and bovine Oct-3/4 genes (26Nordhoff V. Hubner K. Bauer A. Orlova I. Malapetsa A. Scholer H.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of these transcription factors in Sites 2A and 1A. The gradual reduction of DE activity during increasing deletions at –2078CCTCCCCA–2069 (Fig. 1C, bars 9–12) is consistent with the idea that the putative Sp1/Sp3 binding sequence in Site 2A is important for DE activity. To examine the role of the CCCTCCCC motif in Site 2A more vigorously, we introduced point mutations at or around the sequence in pOct2.4-luc, which contained the complete Site 2A and showed an enhancer activity comparable with that of pOct4.8-luc. When the distal or proximal half of CCCTCCCC (CCCT and CCCC, respectively) or the whole CCCTCCC was mutated to unrelated sequences (Fig. 1D, mutants A-2, -3, and -4, respectively), the enhancer activity in D3 ES cells was unexpectedly not affected compared with the wild-type pOct2.4-luc (Fig. 1D, compare bars 5, 6, and 7 with bar 3). Similarly, when the CTGC sequence present immediately upstream of the CCCTCCC motif was replaced with an unrelated sequence, the enhancer activity was not reduced either (Fig. 1D, mutant A-1 and Fig. 1D, bars 3 and 4). Therefore, we concluded that the exact sequence of the CCCTCCC motif is not essential for the function of Site 2A. DE Contains a Novel Motif Site 2B—To delineate the region necessary for the enhancer activity of DE in ES cells more precisely, we introduced a series of internal deletions in pOct2.2-luc which contained the complete Site 2A. These mutants contained regions ranging from –2173 to various proximal ends, namely –2173/–2038, –2173/–1934, and –2173/–1277 (Fig. 2A). The Oct-3/4 promoter region (–284/–1, hereafter called Fragment P) is included in all of the mutant constructs. In contrast, PE, which is known to be dispensable for Oct-3/4 expression in ES cells (8Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Scholer H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is not present in the mutant constructs. As shown in Fig. 2A, pOct2.2-luc exhibited an enhancer activity that was comparable with that of pOct4.8-luc (Fig. 2A, bars 2 and 3). When the internal region –2037/–285 was deleted (mutant –2173/–2038+P), the enhancer activity was reduced significantly (bar 4). However, similar mutants possessing smaller internal deletions (mutants –2173/–1938+P and –2173/–1277+P) showed increased DE activities compared with pOct2.2 (bars 5 and 6). These results led us to propose two hypotheses. First, the region missing in –2173/–2038 but present in –2173/–1938 (i.e. region –2037/–1938) contains an activating element for DE. Because this region does not overlap with and lies proximally to Site 2A, this putative activating element should be distinct from Site 2A and is called Site 2B hereafter. Second, the region deleted in both –2173/–1938 and –2173/–1277 (i.e. region –1276/–285) contains an inhibitory element for DE. PE may be a candidate for this inhibitory element. The latter possibility was not investigated further in this study. To map the location of Site 2B, we constructed a second series of internal deletion mutants of pOct2.2-luc. Starting with mutant –2173/–2038, which showed significantly reduced enhancer activity, we included proximally extending regions and tested these mutants for their enhancer activity in D3 ES cells (Fig. 2B). mutant –2173/–2029+P showed minimal activity, as did mutant –2173/–2038+P (bar 5). In contrast, mutant –2173/–2024+P showed significant activity comparable with that of pOct2.2-luc (bar 6). This result suggested the presence of an important element in the region –2028/–2024. A second increase in activity was noted when mutants –2173/–2015+P and –2173/–2009+P were compared, suggesting the presence of another activating element in the region –2014/–2009. We therefore tentatively mapped the proximal boundary of Site 2B at –2024. It was noted that pOct1.9-luc, which contained neither Site 2A nor 2B, did not show any noticeable transcription (bar 16). We next determined the distal boundary of Site 2B. We first examined whether the intervening sequence between Sites 2A and 2B is important for DE. For this purpose, successive 8 or 9 nucleotides present within the intervening region were replaced with the XhoI linker (CTCGAG) in mutant –2173/–1991+P (Fig. 2C, IN-a∼IN-e). The DE activity was largely resistant to or increased by the linker replacement at –2063/–2055 (IN-a), –2056/–2050 (IN-b), –2052/–2044 (IN-c), and –2047/–2041 (IN-d) (Fig. 2C, bars 4–7). However, the replacement at –2042/–2034 reduced DE activity to approximately half of that shown by the parent mutant –2173/–1991+P (IN-e; Fig. 2C, bars 3 and 8). These results indicated that Sites 2A and 2B function independently in that the sequence lying between them is not essential for DE activity, and the distal boundary of Site 2B was tentatively mapped at –2040 (the distal end of the sequence contained by the enhancer-proficient IN-d). Accordingly, Site 2B corresponds to the region –2040/–2024. This region is highly conserved among human, bovine, and mouse (26Nordhoff V. Hubner K. Bauer A. Orlova I. Malapetsa A. Scholer H.R. Mamm.

https://openalex.org/W2120533079,"N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is a widely expressed sialic acid in mammalian cells. Although humans are genetically deficient in producing Neu5Gc, small amounts are present in human cells in vivo. A dietary origin was suggested by human volunteer studies and by observing that free Neu5Gc is metabolically incorporated into cultured human carcinoma cells by unknown mechanisms. We now show that free Neu5Gc uptake also occurs in other human and mammalian cells. Inhibitors of certain non-clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways reduce Neu5Gc accumulation. Studies with human mutant cells show that the lysosomal sialic acid transporter is required for metabolic incorporation of free Neu5Gc. Incorporation of glycosidically bound Neu5Gc from exogenous glycoconjugates (relevant to human gut epithelial exposure to dietary Neu5Gc) requires the transporter as well as the lysosomal sialidase, which presumably acts to release free Neu5Gc. Thus, exogenous Neu5Gc reaches lysosomes via pinocytic/endocytic pathways and is exported in free form into the cytosol, becoming available for activation and transfer to glycoconjugates. In contrast, N-glycolylmannosamine (ManNGc) apparently traverses the plasma membrane by passive diffusion and becomes available for conversion to Neu5Gc in the cytosol. This mechanism can also explain the metabolic incorporation of chemically synthesized unnatural sialic acids, as reported by others. Finally, to our knowledge, this is the first example of delivery to the cytosol of an extracellular small molecule that cannot cross the plasma membrane, utilizing fluid pinocytosis and a specific lysosomal transporter. The approach could, thus, potentially be generalized to any small molecule that has a specific lysosomal transporter but not a plasma membrane transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2000312541,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is emerging as an important and versatile mediator of physiological processes to the extent that treatment of animals with exogenous CO gas has beneficial effects in a range of vascular- and inflammatory-related disease models. The recent discovery that certain transition metal carbonyls function as CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs) in biological systems highlighted the potential of exploiting this and similar classes of compounds as a stratagem to deliver CO for therapeutic purposes. Here we describe the biochemical features and pharmacological actions of a newly identified water-soluble CO releaser (CORM-A1) that, unlike the first prototypic molecule recently described (CORM-3), does not contain a transition metal and liberates CO at a much slower rate under physiological conditions. Using a myoglobin assay and an amperometric CO electrode, we demonstrated that the release of CO from CORM-A1 is both pH- and temperature-dependent with a half-life of approximately 21 min at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. In isolated aortic rings, CORM-A1 promoted a gradual but profound concentration-dependent vasorelaxation over time, which was highly amplified by YC-1 (1 microM) and attenuated by ODQ, a stimulator and inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, respectively. Similarly, administration of CORM-A1 (30 micromol/kg i.v.) in vivo produced a mild decrease in mean arterial pressure, which was markedly potentiated by pretreatment with YC-1 (1.2 micromol/kg i.v.). Interestingly, an inactive form of CORM-A1 that is incapable of releasing CO failed to promote both vasorelaxation and hypotension, thus directly implicating CO as the mediator of the observed pharmacological effects. Our results reveal that the bioactivities exerted by CORM-A1 reflect its intrinsic biochemical behavior of a slow CO releaser, which may be advantageous in the treatment of chronic conditions that require CO to be delivered in a carefully controlled manner."

The glycation adducts formed and structural and functional changes induced by methylglyoxal modification have not been fully disclosed. Methylglyoxal reacted with human serum albumin under physiological conditions to form mainly the hydroimidazolone Nδ-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-ornithine (92% of total modification) with a minor formation of argpyrimidine, Nϵ-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine, and methylglyoxal lysine dimer. When human serum albumin was modified minimally with methylglyoxal, tryptic peptide mapping indicated a hotspot of modification at Arg-410 located in drug-binding site II and the active site of albumin-associated esterase activity. Modification of Arg-410 by methylglyoxal was found in albumin glycated in vivo. Other sites of minor modification were: Arg-114, Arg-186, Arg-218, and Arg-428. Hydroimidazolone formation at Arg-410 inhibited ketoprofen binding and esterase activity; correspondingly, glycation in the presence of ketoprofen inhibited Arg-410 modification and loss of esterase activity. The pH dependence of esterase activity indicated a catalytic group with pKa = 7.9 ± 0.1, assigned to the catalytic base Tyr-411 with the conjugate base stabilized by interaction with the guanidinium group of Arg-410. Modification by methylglyoxal destabilized Tyr-411 and increased the pKa to 8.8 ± 0.1. Molecular dynamics and modeling studies indicated that hydroimidazolone formation caused structural distortion leading to disruption of arginine-directed hydrogen bonding and loss of electrostatic interactions. Methylglyoxal modification of critical arginine residues, therefore, whether experimental or physiological, is expected to disrupt protein-ligand interactions and inactivate enzyme activity by hydroimidazolone formation.

Methylglyoxal modification of critical arginine residues, therefore, whether experimental or physiological, is expected to disrupt protein-ligand interactions and inactivate enzyme activity by hydroimidazolone formation. Methylglyoxal is an important glycating agent formed endogenously in physiological systems. It is formed by the spontaneous degradation of triosephosphates, oxidative metabolism of ketone bodies and catabolism of threonine (1Thornalley P.J. Mol. Aspects of Med. 1993; 14: 287-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).

Cellular and extracellular proteins show minimal extents of modification by methylglyoxal but significant concentrations of methylglyoxal-derived AGEs, approaching the concentrations of the early glycation adduct, fructosyl-lysine, in some cases (2Ahmed N.

The major AGE quantitatively is the hydroimidazolone derived from arginine residues, Nδ-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-ornithine (MG-H1). There are two other related hydroimidazolone structural isomers, but MG-H1 dominates in proteins glycated under physiological conditions (2Ahmed N. Thornalley P.J. Dawczynski J. Franke S. Strobel J.

Other minor methylglyoxal-derived AGEs are a tetrahydropyrimidine (Nδ-[5-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)-5-hydro-4-imidazolon-2-yl]ornithine), argpyrimidine, Nϵ-carboxyethyllysine, and methylglyoxal-derived lysine dimer (1,3-di(Nϵ-lysino)-4-methyl-imidazolium salt) (reviewed in Ref. 6Ahmed N.

Thornalley P.J. Biochem.J. 2002; 364: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). An important target of glycation in vivo is human serum albumin (HSA), the major protein of human blood plasma. The sites and functional effects of formation of the major glucose-derived glycation adduct fructosyl-lysine have been determined (8Garlick R.L. Mazer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6142-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the sites of glycation of HSA by methylglyoxal have not, and neither have structural and functional changes induced by methylglyoxal modification been characterized. Related to this, however, glyoxal derivatives have been used to interrogate active sites and functional domains of proteins for critical arginine residues, exploiting the mainly arginine-directed modification by these agents (9Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the sites of modification of HSA by methylglyoxal under physiological conditions and show that similar glycation occurs in vivo. The associated functional effects, inhibition of ligand binding and esterase activity, were characterized, and structural changes were predicted to explain the consequences of methylglyoxal modification for albumin functionality.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—HSA (fatty acid-free) was purchased from Sigma. Methylglyoxal, Nϵ-(1-deoxy-d-fructos-1-yl)lysine (referred to as fructosyl-lysine) and AGE authentic standards, including stable isotope-substituted analogues, were prepared as described (6Ahmed N. Argirov O.K. Minhas H.S. Cordeiro C.A. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). High purity methylglyoxal was prepared and purified as described (10McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1992; 263: 137-142Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Preparation of Human Serum Albumin Glycated by Methylglyoxal— HSA glycated minimally by methylglyoxal-derived glycation adducts (MGmin-HSA) was prepared by incubation of methylglyoxal (500 μm) with HSA (6.6 mg/ml) in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 24 h. A similar preparation was made of control protein of HSA incubated without methylglyoxal. Further preparations were made with and without methylglyoxal but preincubated for 30 min and throughout the glycation period with 120 μm ketoprofen (to block drug-binding site II). The glycated and control HSA preparations were dialyzed against 30 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 4 °C, lyophilized to dryness, and stored at -20 °C. Validation studies showed that lyophilization did not change the AGE content of these proteins significantly.Protein Glycation Adduct Determination by LC-MS/MS and Tryptic Digestion and Peptide Mapping—Protein glycation adduct residues were determined in exhaustive enzymatic digests (50 μg of protein equivalent) by LC-MS/MS and stable isotope-substituted standard internal standardization, as described (3Thornalley P.J. Battah S. Ahmed N. Karachalias N. Agalou S. Babaei-Jadidi R. Dawnay A. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). MGmin-HSA and HSA control (100 μg) were diluted to 20 μl with water. Aliquots of 40 mm HCl (25 μl), pepsin solution (2 mg/ml in 20 mm HCl; 5 μl), and thymol solution (2 mg/ml in 20 mm HCl; 5 μl) were added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The sample was then neutralized and buffered at pH 7.4 by the addition of 25 μlof0.5 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 5 μl of 260 mm KOH. Pronase E solution (2 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; 5 μl) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under nitrogen. Aminopeptidase solution (2 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; 5 μl) and prolidase solution (2 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; 5 μl) were added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under nitrogen (6Ahmed N. Argirov O.K. Minhas H.S. Cordeiro C.A. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This gave the final enzymatic hydrolysate (100 μl) for the AGE assay. AGE and amino acid recoveries were 87–100%; fructosyl-lysine recovery was 71% (3Thornalley P.J. Battah S. Ahmed N. Karachalias N. Agalou S. Babaei-Jadidi R. Dawnay A. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Analytes released by self-digestion of proteases in assay blanks were subtracted from analyte estimates. The samples were assayed for glycation adducts by LC-MS/MS using a 2695 Separation module with a Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detector (Waters-Micromass, Manchester, UK). Interbatch coefficients were 2–10% (3Thornalley P.J. Battah S. Ahmed N. Karachalias N. Agalou S. Babaei-Jadidi R. Dawnay A. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar).For peptide mapping, aqueous albumin samples (0.67 mg/ml) were reduced by the addition of dithiothreitol (4 mg/ml, 10 μl) and incubation at 37 °C in the dark for 30 min. Cysteinyl thiols were then blocked by the addition of iodoacetamide (9 mg/ml, 10 μl), and the sample was incubated at 37 °C in the dark for a further 30 min. Residual iodoacetamide was quenched by the addition of a further aliquot (10 μl) of dithiothreitol (4 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 30 min. l-1-Chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-4-phenyl-2-butanone-treated trypsin (enzyme-to-substrate ratio, 1:50, w/w) in 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, and 37 °C, was added and incubated for 10 h. The digest was lyophilized and reconstituted in water. Tryptic digests of HSA derivatives were analyzed by LC-MS on the Waters-Micromass Quattro Ultima system in single mass analyzer mode. The column was a Symmetry™ ODS (2.1 × 100 mm; particle size, 100 Å) with a 10 × 2.1-mm guard column (Waters, Watford, UK). The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. The eluent was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water with a linear gradient of 0–10% methanol from 0 to 30 min. The eluate was monitored by absorbance in the range 200–400 nm and by positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry for parent ion masses in the range 100–2000 Da. Cumulative mass spectra were analyzed for tryptic peptide parent ions against a theoretical peptide map of an HSA tryptic digest using the Biolynx software and single ion response chromatograms generated from accumulated data. Peptide ion responses were normalized to that of the C-terminal (unmodified) peptide; coefficients of variance for normalized peptide responses were 1–8% (n = 3). Loss of specific peptides in MGmin-HSA was determined by comparing the mean of three normalized peptide responses in peptide digests modified and unmodified.Similar tryptic digests were prepared of plasma protein from human subjects. Plasma protein (0.33 mg) was washed with water on a 10-kDa cut-off ultrafiltration microspin filter, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin as described above. Aliquots (30 ng of protein digest, 0.5 μl) were then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Bruker Daltonics Reflex IV mass spectrometer with a sample matrix containing α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/ml).Two-dimensional Electrophoresis and Circular Dichroism Spectra— Isoelectric focusing separation was done using precast immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gel strips (pH 5.3–6.5; strip length, 18 cm; Amersham Biosciences). The IPG strips were rehydrated overnight in trays loaded with the protein samples according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isoelectric focusing was performed using an Amersham Biosciences Ettan IPGphor isoelectric focusing cell unit at 20 °C with a maximum current of 50 μA/strip. The isoelectric focusing run involved a programmed voltage gradient of 500–8,000 V for a total 54 kVh. The IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 20 mm dithiothreitol and for 5 min in 1 mm iodoacetamide solution. Following SDS-PAGE on a 1-mm-thick 4-20% gradient gel, albumin spots were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained for visualization, and then documented (11Turner M. Chantry D. Feldmann M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).CD spectra of HSA and MGmin-HSA were recorded in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and room temperature, on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. The instrument was flushed with nitrogen gas for a better performance below 200 nm. A rectangular 10-mm-path length cell and a cylindrical 0.2-mm-path length cell were employed in the regions of 360–230 and 260–185 nm, respectively. All of the spectra were solvent base line-corrected, and the concentration of the control HSA and MGmin-HSA was deduced assuming ϵ279 nm = 0.531 mg/ml (12Peters T. All about Albumin. Academic Press, New York1996: 25Google Scholar). The spectra were deconvoluted using a principle component regression analysis method to deduce the proportion of α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil in the secondary structure of the proteins (13Arvinte T.

Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).Drug Binding Studies and Esterase Activity Studies—The binding of ketoprofen to binding site II, domain 3A in HSA, and MGmin-HSA was studied. Ketoprofen (0.1–2 μm) and albumin derivative (10 μm) were incubated in 67 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 37 °C for 30 min. The unbound ligand fractions were separated by ultrafiltration centrifugation (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min) using a 12-kDa cut-off membrane. Adsorption of ketoprofen on to the filtration membrane and apparatus were negligible. The concentration of unbound ligand was determined by HPLC. The HPLC system consisted of a Waters 717 plus autosampler (with samples maintained at 4 °C), Waters 600 quaternary pump, and Waters 481 Lambda Max absorbance detector. Columns for reversed phase HPLC were a 3.9 × 150-mm NOVAPAK™ ODS (4 μm) fitted with a 3.9 × 20-mm NOVAPAK™ ODS Sentry guard column. The mobile phase was 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer with 50% (v/v) methanol, pH 7.4. Ketoprofen was detected at 257 nm.Esterase activities of MGmin-HSA and HSA were determined with the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylacetate following the hydrolysis to p-nitrophenol and acetate. The reaction was followed by monitoring the appearance of p-nitrophenol, detected spectrophotometrically at 400 nm. The reaction mixtures contained 50 μmp-nitrophenylacetate and 20 μm protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 37 °C. The pH dependence of esterase activity was studied in the pH range 6.4–9.4 using phosphate buffer in the pH range 6.4–7.8 and pyrophosphate buffer in the pH range 8.4–9.4. Extinction coefficients for p-nitrophenol were determined at each pH value studied, and esterase activity was deduced from the initial rates of absorbance (dA400/dt)o.Molecular Dynamics, Arginine Residue Surface Exposure, and Surface Charge Density—The AMBER 7.0 force field (15Case D.A.

Arg-410 was replaced with the hydroimidazolone MG-H1 residue. The native and modified protein structures were equilibrated using the Generalized Born solvation model (17Bashford D. Case D.A. Annu.

Chem. 2000; 51: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) and then subjected to 100 ps of molecular dynamics using the AMBER force field until the total energy of each system reached equilibration. Final energy minimization of each protein was carried out within AMBER. Energy minimizations of modifications and molecular graphics were performed using DS Viewer Pro 5.0 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The electrostatic potential was calculated using the Poisson-Boltzmann (18Davis M.E. Madura J.D. Sines J. Luty B.A. Allison S.A. McCammon J.A.

We examined the presence of glycation adducts by quantifying the loss of lysine and arginine residues by chromophoric and fluorimetric lysine- and arginine-specific reagents and amino acid analysis with acid hydrolysis (22Westwood M.E. Thornalley P.J. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This showed convincingly that arginine residues were lost preferentially by glycation with methylglyoxal. With recent advances in the application of LC-MS/MS to the detection of protein glycation adducts (3Thornalley P.J. Battah S. Ahmed N. Karachalias N. Agalou S. Babaei-Jadidi R. Dawnay A. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), we are now able to quantify methylglyoxal-derived glycation adducts in such modified proteins. Studies of the concentrations of methylglyoxal-derived glycation adducts in human plasma proteins and molecular mass measurements of human serum albumin in vivo indicated that HSA is also modified minimally by methylglyoxal-derived glycation adducts in vivo (3Thornalley P.J.

Therefore, to quantify the glycation adducts formed and identify sites in HSA reactive toward methylglyoxal under physiological conditions in a physiologically relevant model glycated protein, we prepared HSA modified minimally by methylglyoxal (MGmin-HSA). The type and amount of glycation adducts in MGmin-HSA were assessed by quantitative glycation adduct screening with LC-MS/MS (Table I). Estimates of other glycation adducts, oxidation, and nitration adducts in HSA that were not changed significantly by glycation with methylglyoxal were (mmol/mol protein; mean ± S.D., n = 4): Nϵ-fructosyl-lysine, 10.0 ± 0.9; Nϵ-carboxymethyl-lysine, 5.7 ± 0.8; glyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone Nδ-(5-hydro-4-imidazolon-2-yl)ornithine, <0.5; 3-deoxyglucosone-derived hydroimidazolone Nδ-(5-hydro-5-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)-4-imidazolon-2-yl)ornithine and related structural isomers, 7.8 ± 2.8; pentosidine, 0.073 ± 0.013; methionine sulfoxide, 124 ± 11; and 3-nitrotyrosine, 0.22 ± 0.05. The main methylglyoxal-derived glycation adduct in MGmin-HSA was the hydroimidazolone MG-H1, found at ∼2.5 molar equivalents and representing 91% of total methylglyoxal-derived glycation adducts. The LC-MS/MS detection of MG-H1 showed the expected partial resolution of two epimers of the hydroimidazolone (3Thornalley P.J. Battah S. Ahmed N. Karachalias N. Agalou S. Babaei-Jadidi R. Dawnay A. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, a and b). Minor methylglyoxal-derived adducts were: argpyrimidine, 7%; Nϵ-carboxyethyl-lysine, 1%; and methylglyoxal-derived lysine dimer, <1% of total methylglyoxal glycation adducts. The total methylglyoxal-derived adducts in MGmin-HSA, deduced by preparation of MGmin-HSA with radiolabeled [2-14C]methylglyoxal (27Westwood M.E. Argirov O.K. Abordo E.A. Thornalley P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was 2.45 ± 0.30 mol/mol protein, indicating that all of the methylglyoxal-derived adducts were detected. High resolution isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE of MGmin-HSA showed a small decrease in pI with respect to HSA (5.62 versus 5.76) and no evidence of significant intermolecular cross-linking (Fig. 2), consistent with loss of arginine residue positive charge by formation of MG-H1 residues.Table IGlycation adducts in human serum albumin modified minimally by methylglyoxalGlycation adductHSAMGmin-HSAmmol/molmmol/molMG-H141 ± 22493 ± 87Argpyrimidine0.08 ± 0.04200 ± 40Nϵ-Carboxyethyl-lysine4.0 ± 0.429.7 ± 1.8Methylglyoxal-derived lysine dimeraThis value was below the limit of detection (0.04)5 ± 1a This value was below the limit of detection (0.04) Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of human serum albumin modified minimally by methylglyoxal.a, HSA (pI = 5.76) and b, MGmin-HSA (pI = 5.62). c, section of a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrum of a tryptic digest in protein of human plasma glycated in vivo.

Tryptic peptide responses were normalized to the response of the C-terminal peptide. Loss of peptide (by methylglyoxal modification) was deduced by comparison of normalized peptide responses in MGmin-HSA to that of control HSA in triplicate. The normalized peptide ion response gave reproducible detection when singly charged peptide responses were quantified; doubly and triply charged peptide ions suffered variable ion quenching and were not used in deducing peptide detection responses. The summation of all peptide responses showing statistically significant decrease in MGmin-HSA, with respect to HSA, gave a total molar equivalent peptide loss of 2.06. This loss is assumed to be due to modification of peptides by MG-H1. The total modification by methylglyoxal in MGmin-HSA was ∼2.5 molar equivalents; the residual ∼0.5 molar equivalents of modified peptide difference between the total and that located in tryptic peptides is accounted for by hydrolysis of MG-H1 during the tryptic digestion (expect loss of 26% of the total modification or 0.6 molar equivalents) (6Ahmed N. Argirov O.K. Minhas H.S. Cordeiro C.A. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The individual peptides with decreased detection in MGmin-HSA are given in Table II. They represent modification of arginine residues (mol % modified) at Arg-114 (36%), Arg-186 (25%), Arg-218 (31%), Arg-410 (89%), and Arg-428 (25%). For the detection of T31213–218, there was significant interference from a dipeptide T67–68520–524. Peptide T31 contained a chromophoric tryptophan residue, the only tryptophan residue in HSA, whereas T67–68 did not. Hence, absorbance detection at 286 nm was used to quantify the loss of T31. The peptide containing the Arg-410 residue, T52, showed the most decreased response in MGmin-HSA and hence had the highest modification. Formation of MG-H1 residues in MGmin-HSA prevented trypsin cleavage at that site such that corresponding uncleaved tryptic dipeptides were detected. MG-H1-containing dipeptides in tryptic digests of MGmin-HSA were detected for Arg-186, Arg-218, Arg-410, and Arg-428 but not for Arg-114. Hence for the hotspot modification of Arg-410, the modified dipeptide T52–53 (FQNALLVRMG-H1YTK) was detected in digests of MGmin-HSA but not of HSA (Fig. 1, c and d). Tryptic digests of plasma protein glycated in vivo also contained the MG-H1-modified peptide detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (predicted FQNALLVRMG-H1YTK 1406.9; found peptide mass 1406.8 Da; Fig. 2c). This suggests that Arg-410 is a hotspot for albumin modification by methylglyoxal experimentally and may also be so physiologically too (Fig. 1, e and f). MG-H1 residues have been detected and quantified by LC-MS/MS in plasma protein in vivo where increases were found in diabetes and uremia (3Thornalley P.J. Battah S. Ahmed N. Karachalias N. Agalou S.

https://openalex.org/W1996457468,"Recent studies indicate that oxysterols, which are ligands for the nuclear hormone liver X receptors (LXR), decrease amyloid beta (Abeta) secretion in vitro. The effect was attributed primarily to the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transcriptionally up-regulated by ligand-activated LXRs. We now examined the effect of the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317, which can be used in vivo, on Abeta production in vitro and in APP23 transgenic mice. T0901317 applied to a variety of in vitro models, including immortalized fibroblasts from Tangier patients, and primary embryonic mouse neurons caused a concentration-dependent decrease in Abeta secretion, and this effect was increased by the addition of apolipoprotein A-I. The inhibition of Abeta production by T0901317 was cell-type specific, being more prominent in primary neurons than in non-neuronal cells. Tangier fibroblasts lacking a functional ABCA1 secreted more Abeta than control fibroblasts, thus demonstrating the role of ABCA1 in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Abeta generation. T0901317 treatment of 11-week-old APP23 mice for 6 days showed a significant increase in ABCA1 expression and a decrease in the ratio of soluble APP (sAPP)beta- to sAPPalpha-cleavage products. Most importantly, the treatment caused a statistically significant reduction in the levels of soluble Abeta40 and of Abeta42 in the brain these mice. Our experiments demonstrate that T0901317 decreases amyloidogenic processing of APP in vitro and in vivo, thus supporting the search for potent and specific LXR ligands with properties allowing therapeutic application."
https://openalex.org/W2085415089,"Signaling pathways targeting mitochondria are poorly understood. We here examine phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent pathway of subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain. Using anti-phospho antibodies, we show that cow liver COX subunit I is tyrosinephosphorylated in the presence of theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that creates high cAMP levels, but not in its absence. The site of phosphorylation, identified by mass spectrometry, is tyrosine 304 of COX catalytic subunit I. Subunit I phosphorylation leads to a decrease of V(max) and an increase of K(m) for cytochrome c and shifts the reaction kinetics from hyperbolic to sigmoidal such that COX is fully or strongly inhibited up to 10 mum cytochrome c substrate concentrations, even in the presence of allosteric activator ADP. To assess our findings with the isolated enzyme in a physiological context, we tested the starvation signal glucagon on human HepG2 cells and cow liver tissue. Glucagon leads to COX inactivation, an effect also observed after incubation with adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. Thus, the glucagon receptor/G-protein/cAMP pathway regulates COX activity. At therapeutic concentrations used for asthma relief, theophylline causes lung COX inhibition and decreases cellular ATP levels, suggesting a mechanism for its clinical action."

Recent studies showed that galectin-1 (Gal-1) plays a key role in tumor-immune escape by killing antitumor effector T cells.

Furthermore, this protein triggers an apoptotic program involving an increase of mitochondrial membrane potential and participation of the ceramide pathway. In addition, Gal-1 induces mitochondrial coalescence, budding, and fission accompanied by an increase and/or redistribution of fission-associated molecules h-Fis and DRP-1. Importantly, these changes are detected in both resting and activated human T cells, suggesting that Gal-1-induced cell death might become an excellent model to analyze the morphogenetic changes of mitochondria during the execution of cell death.

In addition, we have recently demonstrated that Gal-1 contributes to the immune privilege of tumors by killing anti-tumor CD4+ and CD8+ effector T lymphocytes (14Rubinstein N. Alvarez M. Zwirner N.W.

Devadas S. Zhang X. Zhang L. Keegan A. Greeneltch K. Solomon J. Wei L. Das J. Sun E. Liu C. Yuan Z. Zhou J.N. Shi Y. Immunol. Res. 2003; 28: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); (ii) T cell activation, e.g. via phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and/or interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulation, leads to an increased susceptibility to cell death in a process called activation-induced cell death (16Baumann S. Krueger A. Kirchhoff S. Krammer P.H. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Green D.R. Droin N. Pinkoski M. Immunol.

Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Both of them, however, involve significant morphogenetic changes of mitochondria (20Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) as well as changes of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), opening of the so-called mitochondrial megapore, and release of apoptogenic factors (21Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). However, there is still scarce information regarding the mechanisms underlying susceptibility of resting or activated T cells to physiological or pathological apoptotic stimuli.In the present work we investigated the mechanisms underlying the proapoptotic activity exerted by Gal-1 in a physiological cell system represented by resting as well as activated human T cells. We found that this endogenous lectin can sensitize resting T cells and bolster activated T cells to Fas-mediated “physiological” cell death. The subcellular mechanism underlying these effects involves glycosphingolipid-mediated budding and fission of the mitochondria.This is the first demonstration showing that Gal-1 sensitizes resting human T cells to undergo apoptosis. Elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in Gal-1 effects is essential for a complete understanding of the immunosuppressive effects of this protein and its novel role in tumor-immune privilege (14Rubinstein N. Alvarez M. Zwirner N.W. Toscano M.A. Ilarregui J.M. Bravo A. Mordoh J. Fainboim L. Podhajcer O.L. Rabinovich G.A.

This study also demonstrates that a dynamic imbalance of mitochondrial fusion/fission processes can effectively be involved in apoptosis of nonengineered freshly isolated primary cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation and Activation of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes—Human peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors (HDs) were isolated from freshly heparinized blood through a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Lympholyte-H, Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Peripheral blood lymphocytes were subcultured in 25-cm2 or 75-cm2 Falcon plastic flasks at a density of ∼1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 15% fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland, UK), 1% nonessential amino acids, 5 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For peripheral blood lymphocyte activation, CD3+ T cells purified by magnetic beads (Dynal, Great Neck, NY) were cultured for 72 h with 2 μg/ml PHA (Roche Applied Science) and 60 IU/ml IL-2 (Invitrogen).Biochemical Characterization of Human Recombinant Gal-1—Human recombinant Gal-1 was obtained and purified as described by Hirabayashi et al. (22Hirabayashi J. Ayaki H. Soma G. Kasai K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In brief, Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) was transformed with the pET21a/hGal1 plasmid (kindly provided by Drs. Hirabayashi and K. I. Kasai), and human Gal-1 expression was assessed by immunoblotting. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography on an asialofetuin-agarose column and eluted with lactose after extensive washing of the column. The hemagglutinating activity was measured as described previously (10Rabinovich G.A. Iglesias M.M. Modesti N.M. Castagna L.F. Wolfenstein-Todel C. Riera C.M. Sotomayor C.E. J.

The lipopolysaccharide content of the purified sample was less than 60 ng/mg protein, determined by a colorimetric endotoxin determination reagent (Pyrodick, Seikagaku, Tokyo). The eluted protein was reactive with an anti-Gal-1-specific polyclonal rabbit antibody, and the minimum concentration of protein required for hemagglutinating activity was ∼1 μg/ml (10Rabinovich G.A.

The concentration-dependent monomer/dimer status of Gal-1, assessed by nonreducing PAGE and immunoblotting, is documented in Fig. 1A.In Vitro Treatments—Previous to cell death, binding of Gal-1 to human resting and activated T cells was performed using biotinylated Gal-1 and FITC-streptavidin in the absence or presence of 30 mm lactose as described previously (9Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Isolated human T cells (resting or PHA/IL-2-activated) were treated with different concentrations of Gal-1 (5, 20, 50, and 100 μg/ml) for different time periods (6, 18, 36, and 72 h) in association, or not, with 500 ng/ml anti-human Fas IgM mAb (α-Fas, clone CH11, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). As a negative experimental control an equal concentration of anti-CD3 IgM was also employed. Gal-1 and CH11 treatments were also performed: (i) in the presence of neutralizing anti-human Fas IgG1 mAb (clone ZB4, Upstate Biotechnology, 250 ng/ml); (ii) in cells pretreated for 1 h with 5 μm ZVAD-CHO (a pan-caspase inhibitor, R&D Systems, Minneapolis); or (iii) in cells incubated in the presence of 30 mm lactose. To evaluate the involvement of ceramide-mediated signaling in Gal-1-induced apoptosis, resting lymphocytes were pretreated for 1 h with a combination of specific inhibitors of the ceramide pathway: 20 μm fumonisine B1 (B1; Sigma) and 10 μm monensin (Mon; Sigma) (both solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide) before the addition of Gal-1. Although FB1 inhibits sphingolipid and glycosphingolipid synthesis via (dihydro)ceramide synthesis inhibition (23Merril A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), Mon prevents ceramide generation through inhibition of acidic sphingomyelinase (24Mendez A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5891-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dimethyl sulfoxide given alone was used as an additional control.Evaluation of Cell Surface Receptors—The surface expression of molecules associated with T cell activation (CD69, CD38, and HLA-DR) and cell death (CD95/Fas) was assessed by flow cytometry on resting and activated T lymphocytes treated with Gal-1. For this purpose, we used fluorochrome-conjugated FITC or mAbs raised against human CD95, CD38, HLA-DR and CD69 (BD Biosciences). Appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs of the same isotype were used as negative controls.Cell Death Assays—Quantitative evaluation of apoptosis was performed by using the following flow and static cytometry methods: (i) double staining using FITC-conjugated annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit (Eppendorf, Milan, Italy); (ii) staining with chromatin dye Hoechst (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as described previously (25Conti L. Rainaldi G. Matarrese P. Varano B. Rivabene R. Columba S. Sato A. Belardelli F. Malorni W. Gessani S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); and (iii) evaluation of DNA fragmentation in ethanol-fixed cells using PI (Sigma) (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that Gal-1-induced cell agglutination may damage the cells, we incubated the cells with 30 mm lactose to dissociate cell clusters after Gal-1 binding and before cell death assays.Analysis of the MMP—The MMP of control and treated cells was studied by using the JC-1 probe. Briefly, cells were stained with 10 μm JC-1 (Molecular Probes) as described previously (26Cossarizza A. Franceschi C. Monti D. Salvioli S. Bellesia E. Rivabene R. Biondo L. Rainaldi G. Tinari A. Malorni W. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Tetramethylrhodamine ester (1 μm, TMRM, Molecular Probes, red fluorescence) was also used to confirm the data obtained using JC-1.Cell Cycle Analyses—For DNA analysis ethanol-fixed lymphocytes were incubated with μg/ml PI (Sigma) and 10 μm RNase (Sigma) for 45 min. After this time period, samples were acquired directly on a FAC-Scan flow cytometer by CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). At least 20,000 events for each sample were statistically analyzed by ModFIT software for Macintosh to determine the percentage of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases, respectively.Analysis of the Redox Balance—Resting and PHA/IL-2-activated human T lymphocytes (5 × 105 cells), cultured in the presence or absence of Gal-1, were incubated in 495 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm dihydrorhodamine 123 (Molecular Probes) or 1 μm dihydroethidium (Molecular Probes) in polypropylene test tubes for 15 min at 37 °C. Intracellular content of reduced thiols was explored by using 10 μm 5-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichloro-dihydrofluoresceindiacetate (Molecular Probes). Cells exposed to the GSH depleting drug l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (7.5 mm; Sigma) for 16 h were considered as negative controls (data not shown). The median values of fluorescence intensity histograms were used to provide semiquantitative assessment of reduced thiols content and reactive oxygen intermediates production.Analysis of Caspase Activation—For detection of the active form of caspases-8, -9, and -3, colorimetric protease assay kits (Chemicon International, Inc.) were used. Proteins obtained from cytosolic extracts (50–200 μg) were incubated with 200 μm IETD-pNA (for caspase-8), LEHD-pNA (for caspase-9) or DEVD-pNA (for caspase-3). The assay was based on the spectrophotometric detection of the chromophore p-nitroanilide (pNA) after cleavage from the labeled substrates. p-NA light emission was quantified using a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. Comparison of the absorbance of p-NA from apoptotic samples with nonstimulated controls allowed determination of the-fold increase in caspase activity (27Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar).Immunocytochemistry—Immunofluorescence analyses were performed by double staining as follows. Briefly, control and treated samples were incubated, with 1 μm Mito Tracker Green FM (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature, and then permeabilized by 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. For localization and quantification of h-Fis, DRP-1 and uncoupler (UCP) proteins, samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mAbs specific to h-Fis (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego), DRP-1 (BD Biosciences), or UCP-2 (Calbiochem). Negative controls were incubated with normal mouse serum. After several washings, samples and isotype controls were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). All samples were mounted with glycerol phosphate-buffered saline (2:1) and analyzed by Intensified Video Microscopy (IVM) as stated elsewhere (28Parlato S. Giammarioli A.M. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Matarrese P. Luciani F. Falchi M. Malorni W. Fais S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5123-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or analyzed by flow cytometry.Analysis of Fas Ligand Secretion—Fas ligand levels were determined in supernatants of lymphocytes cultured in the presence or absence of Gal-1, using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D). Briefly, resting and PHA/IL-2-activated lymphocytes were exposed to Gal-1 for different time periods. Supernatant aliquots were removed 6, 18, 36, and 72 h after exposure to Gal-1 and assayed for Fas ligand secretion according to the manufacturer's instructions.Analysis of Cytochrome c Release—Cytochrome c (Cyt c) was evaluated by a sensitive and specific immunoassay, using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The light emitted was quantified by using a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. Cyt c concentration was expressed as μg/ml.Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—For TEM examination, cells were fixed in 2.5% cacodylate-buffered (0.2 m, pH 7.2) glutaraldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and postfixed in 1% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Fixed specimens were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol solutions and embedded in Agar 100 (Agar Aids, Cambridge, UK). Serial ultrathin sections were collected on 200-mesh grids and then counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were observed with a Philips 208 electron microscope at 80 kV.Morphometric Analyses—Analyses of mitochondrial intracellular localization were carried out by TEM observation of at least 200 cells at the same magnification (3,000×). Values were expressed as the percentage of cells displaying clusters of mitochondria at one pole of the cells with respect to lymphocytes with randomly distributed mitochondria.Immunoelectron Microscopy—Thin sections, collected on gold grids, were treated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) gelatin, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% fetal calf serum, and 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with mAbs raised against anti-Cyt c, endonuclease G (endo G), DRP-1, and h-Fis diluted 1:10 in the same buffer without gelatin overnight at 4 °C. After washing for 1 h at room temperature, sections were labeled with a protein A-10 nm gold conjugate (1:10) for 1 h at room temperature and washed again. Negative controls were incubated with the gold conjugate alone.Data Analysis and Statistics—All samples were analyzed with a FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 488 argon laser. At least 20,000 events were acquired. Data were recorded and analyzed statistically by a Macintosh computer using CellQuest Software. The expression level of the analyzed proteins was expressed as a median value of the fluorescence emission curve, and the statistical significance was calculated by using the parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Statistical analyses of apoptosis data were performed by using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance using the Statview program for Macintosh. All data reported were verified in 12 different HDs and are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Only p values of less than 0.01 were considered as statistically significant.RESULTSGal-1 Sensitizes Resting T Cells to Anti-Fas (α-Fas)-mediated Apoptosis in a Dose-dependent Manner—The first set of experiments was carried out to evaluate the ability of recombinant Gal-1 to modulate the susceptibility of human freshly isolated T cells, both resting and PHA/IL-2-activated, to Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis. Recombinant human Gal-1 was obtained, purified, and characterized, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see also Fig. 1). The lipopolysaccharide content of the purified protein was less than 60 ng/mg protein as has been described previously (22Hirabayashi J. Ayaki H. Soma G. Kasai K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Before the cell death assays we analyzed binding of biotinylated Gal-1 to human resting and activated T cells. Biotinylated Gal-1 (20 μg/ml) bound with higher affinity to PHA/IL-2-activated, compared with resting human T cells (Fig. 1B; gray histograms). Gal-1 binding to activated and resting T cells was inhibited completely in the presence of 30 mm lactose, demonstrating that binding was specific and saccharide-dependent (Fig. 1B, black empty histograms).We observed that Gal-1, at a concentration of 20 μg/ml, was capable of inducing a time-dependent phosphatidylserine exposure and annexin V binding in a significant percentage of activated T cells. In particular, the percentages of annexin V-positive cells were 7.9% ± 2.3% after 6 h, 12.3% ± 3.0% after 18 h, and 22.1% ± 4.9% after 36 h. Results obtained after 72 h of Gal-1 exposure are reported in Fig. 2A (a representative HD, third row, right panel) and Fig. 2B (mean values from 12 different HDs). By contrast, the same Gal-1 concentration was ineffective toward resting T lymphocytes (Fig. 2A, third row, left panel). Importantly, the presence of 30 mm lactose completely inhibited Gal-1-induced phosphatidylserine exposure in both resting and activated lymphocytes (Fig. 2B). Control experiments carried out using the anti-Fas mAb (clone CH11) clearly pointed out the powerful proapoptotic activity elicited by Fas ligation on activated cells, i.e. the so-called activation-induced cell death (17Green D.R. Droin N. Pinkoski M. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, second row, right panel). Interestingly, exposure to 20 μg of Gal-1 significantly sensitized resting lymphocytes to anti-Fas apoptotic triggering inducing higher apoptotic rates (36.7%) compared with control samples (Fig. 2A, bottom row, left panel, Δ% Gal-1 + CH11 versus CH11 alone = 86.6%). In the same vein, in activated T cells, Gal-1 treatment further increased the effects induced by CD95 engagement, significantly bolstering apoptosis (60.4%, Fig. 2A, bottom row, right panel). Results obtained by pooling together data from blood samples of 12 different HDs are reported in Fig. 2B.Fig. 2Gal-1 sensitizes resting and activated T lymphocytes to Fas-mediated cell death.A, percentage of apoptosis as revealed by flow cytometry analysis of resting and PHA/IL-2-activated freshly isolated human T lymphocytes after annexin V-FITC staining. The first row includes controls; the second row shows apoptosis induced by α-Fas triggering (CH11); the third row indicates resting and activated cells cultured with 20 μg/ml Gal-1 in the absence of other stimuli; the fourth row indicates association of CH11 and Gal-1. Results obtained from a representative HD are shown. Numbers indicate the percentage of annexin V-positive cells. Similar results were obtained by the analysis of hypodiploid peaks after PI staining (not shown). B, mean values ± S.D. obtained by pooling together data from 12 different HDs. Asterisks (*) represent p < 0.01. Note that the presence of 30 mm lactose significantly prevented Gal-1 effects.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A dose-dependent response could be observed when human T cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of Gal-1 (Fig. 3A). In particular, doses of Gal-1 ranging from 20 to 100 μg/ml induced a significant (p < 0.01) sensitization to anti-Fas apoptotic triggering (Fig. 3A, a representative HD, compare right panel with left panel, upper and lower right quadrants). Strikingly, considering the general resistance of resting T cells to apoptosis (15Roberts A.I. Devadas S. Zhang X. Zhang L. Keegan A. Greeneltch K. Solomon J. Wei L. Das J. Sun E. Liu C. Yuan Z.

Here, we report that human recombinant dGal-1 bound preferentially and with high affinity (apparent Kd ∼ 2–4 μm) to immobilized extended glycans containing terminal N-acetyllactosamine (LN; Galβ1–4GlcNAc) sequences on poly-N-acetyllactosamine (PL; (–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–)n) sequences, complex-type biantennary N-glycans, or novel chitin-derived glycans modified to contain terminal LN. Although terminal Gal residues are important for dGal-1 recognition, dGal-1 bound similarly to α3-sialylated and α2-fucosylated terminal LN, but not to α6-sialylated and α3-fucosylated terminal LN. The binding specificity of human recombinant dGal-1 was similar to that observed with purified bovine heart-derived dGal-1. Unexpectedly, dGal-1 bound free ligands in solution with relatively low affinity and displayed no preference for extended glycans, indicating that dGal-1 preferentially recognizes extended glycans only when they are surface-bound, such as found on cell surfaces. Human dGal-1 also bound to both native and desialylated human promyelocytic HL-60 cells with similar affinity as observed for immobilized long chain PL. Binding to these cells was reduced upon treatment with endo-β-galactosidase, which cleaves PL sequences, indicating that cell-surface PLs are ligands. To test the role of dimerization in dGal-1 binding, we examined the binding of a mutated form of dGal-1 that weakly dimerizes (monomeric Gal-1 (mGal-1)) and a covalently dimerized (chemically cross-linked) form of mGal-1 (cd-mGal-1). dGal-1 and cd-mGal-1 had similar affinities that were both ∼3.5-fold higher for immobilized PL than observed for mGal-1, suggesting that dGal-1 acts as a dimer to cross-link terminal LN units on immobilized PL. These results indicate that dGal-1 functions as a dimer to recognize LN units on extended PLs on cell surfaces.

Galectins are a family of soluble β-galactoside-binding lectins, earlier classified as S-type lectins because of their solubility, requirement for reducing thiols for activity, and lack of requirement for Ca2+ for ligand binding (1Barondes S.H.

Like many other galectin family members, dGal-1 weakly recognizes lactose (Galβ1–4Glc) and N-acetyllactosamine disaccharides such as the type 2 sequence Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-R (LN) and the type 1 sequence Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ-R (30Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, dGal-1 has been reported to bind with higher affinity to specific glycoproteins containing repeating linear type 2 sequences ((–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–)n) called poly-N-acetyllactosamines (PLs). Such glycoproteins that bind dGal-1 include laminin (31Zhou Q. Cummings R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Zhou Q. Cummings R.D. Arch.

Other glycoprotein ligands for dGal-1 have also been identified, and they may also contain PL sequences (36Ohannesian D.W. Lotan D. Lotan R.

Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, recent data have suggested that dGal-1 may not recognize PL structures with higher affinity compared with its recognition of short non-extended structures (44Ahmad N. Gabius H.J. Sabesan S. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 45Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dGal-1 has been suggested to bind primarily to nonreducing terminal LN residues rather than to mid-chain LN residues within a PL chain (42Solomon J.C. Stoll M.S. Penfold P. Abbott W.M. Childs R.A. Hanfland P. Feizi T. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 43Stowell S.R. Dias-Baruffi M. Penttila L. Renkonen O. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D.

Uncertainty also exists about the affinity of dGal-1 binding to complex-type N-glycans containing non-extended terminal LN units. Although earlier data suggested that dGal-1 binds weakly to non-extended N-glycans (41Merkle R.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16143-16149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), more recent studies have suggested that dGal-1 binds to such N-glycans with relatively high affinity (42Solomon J.C. Stoll M.S. Penfold P. Abbott W.M. Childs R.A. Hanfland P. Feizi T. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 45Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N.

For example, dGal-1 was reported to bind to N-glycans containing non-extended terminal LN units with ∼10-fold higher affinity than to long chain linear PL structures in frontal affinity chromatographic analyses (45Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The reasons behind these apparently conflicting results are not known, but could result from different methods of analyses and/or different ways to immobilize lectins in chromatographic studies. Sialylation and fucosylation of glycoconjugate ligands affect their binding to dGal-1. For example, dGal-1 from different sources has been shown to bind α2,3-sialylated (but not α2,6-sialylated) glycans (30Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sparrow C.P. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol.

J. 1988; 252: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Most of these studies were based on indirect sugar inhibition assays with simple non-extended ligands such as sialylated LN and lactose. More direct binding measurements have been carried out recently with human and bovine dGal-1. Isothermal titration microcalorimetry was used to show that bovine dGal-1 has the same affinity for LN and α2,3-sialyl-LN (44Ahmad N. Gabius H.J. Sabesan S. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Bovine dGal-1 has also been shown to bind to immobilized neoglycolipids containing α2,3-sialylated and non-sialylated lacto-N-tetraose (Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc) by TLC overlay and microwell binding assays (42Solomon J.C. Stoll M.S. Penfold P. Abbott W.M. Childs R.A. Hanfland P. Feizi T. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Human dGal-1 shows significantly lower affinity for α2,6-sialylated complex-type N-glycans than for non-sialylated N-glycans by frontal affinity chromatography (45Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). However, the ability of human or bovine dGal-1 to bind to α2,3-sialylated and α2,6-sialylated PL structures has not been compared simultaneously under the same conditions. It has also been reported that α1,2-fucosylated (but not α1,3/4-fucosylated) structures are recognized by dGal-1 (42Solomon J.C. Stoll M.S. Penfold P. Abbott W.M. Childs R.A. Hanfland P. Feizi T. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 43Stowell S.R. Dias-Baruffi M. Penttila L. Renkonen O. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D.

To address many of these questions about dGal-1 specificity and the possible role of its dimerization in binding, we synthesized a panel of biotinylated oligosaccharides and glycopeptides to study the ligand binding specificity of human and bovine dGal-1 and a mutated form of human dGal-1 that behaves as a monomer (mGal-1) rather than a dimer upon gel filtration (25Dias-Baruffi M. Zhu H. Cho M. Karmakar S. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41282-41293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The glycan structures allowed us to address the role of the terminal sugar residue, PL backbone and chain length, and glycan core structure (N-glycan and O-glycan) in dGal-1 recognition. We also examined the binding of dGal-1 to human promyelocytic HL-60 cells because dGal-1 (but not mGal-1) binding to these cells has been shown to cause cell-surface expression of phosphatidylserine- and annexin V-binding sites (25Dias-Baruffi M.

Overall, our results show that dGal-1 recognizes extended structures containing α2,3-sialylated and non-sialylated terminal LN units with high affinity when ligands are immobilized, but not when ligands are free in solution. Our results also demonstrate that lectin dimerization is required for high affinity binding to immobilized glycan ligands. Synthesis and Biotinylation of Oligosaccharides—The 2-azidoethyl glycoside precursors of compounds LN, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), and NGLNnT (see Fig. 1 for explanations of compound abbreviations) were synthesized as described previously (48Blixt O. Brown J. Schur M.J. Wakarchuk W. Paulson J.C. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 2442-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 2-azidoethyl glycoside precursors of compounds LN2, LN3, S3LN2, S6LN2, F2LN2, and (Lex)3 will be described elsewhere. 2O. Blixt, manuscript in preparation. Each of the 2-azidoethyl glycoside derivatives LN, LN2, LN3, NGLNnT, LNnT, S3LN2, S6LN2, F2LN2, and (Lex)3 (50 μmol) was dissolved in methanol/water (1:9 by volume, 0.5–2 ml) and hydrogenolyzed over palladium/carbon (10%, 5–10 mg) in an H2 atmosphere at room temperature. Sodium hydrogen carbonate (final concentration of 100 mm, pH 8–8.5) and EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl 6′-(biotinamido)-6-hexanamidohexanoate) or EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin) (3 eq; Pierce) were added to the mixture. When the reaction showed completion (analyzed by silica gel TLC, eluent of ethyl acetate/methanol/acetic acid/water, 4:3:3:2 by volume), the crude mixture was filtered and purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G-15 column (1 × 70 cm, equilibrated in 5% n-butyl alcohol). Appropriate fractions were collected and lyophilized to dryness. The residue was further purified on a reversed-phase chromatography column (silica C18, 0.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated in 5% MeOH. Fractions containing the product was collected and lyophilized to give the biotinylated compound. Typical yields were in the range of 50–70%, and purity was estimated to >95% by 1H NMR spectroscopy (data not shown). LN3-biotin and LNnT-biotin (7 nmol each) were sialylated at 37 °C for ∼66 h using a molar excess of CMP-NeuAc and 10–13 milliunits of α2,3-N-sialyltransferase (Calbiochem) in a total reaction volume of 280 μl of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Triton CF-54 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction mixtures confirmed that sialylation of LN3-biotin and LNnT-biotin was successful. The degree of sialylation was ∼60–70% for LN3-biotin and >80% for LNnT-biotin as estimated by reversed-phase HPLC. Sialylated samples (S3LN3 and S3LNnT) were then treated with β-galactosidase as described below to remove non-sialylated terminal galactose residues. The reaction mixtures were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and used directly to immobilize the biotinylated oligosaccharides on streptavidin plates. N,N′-di-N-acetylchitobiose (CB) and N,N′,N″,N′′′-tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose (CT) (Dextra Laboratories, Ltd.) were biotinylated using EZ-Link™ Biotin-LC-hydrazide (biotinamido caproyl hydrazide) (Pierce) as will be described elsewhere. 3A. Leppänen and R. D. Cummings, manuscript in preparation. CB-LC-biotin and CT-LC-biotin (100 nmol each) were galactosylated using UDP-Gal (200 nmol) and 50 milliunits of bovine milk β1,4-galactosyltransferase (Sigma) in a total volume of 300 μl of 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm MnCl2. The completeness of the reaction and formation of galactosylated CB (GCB) and galactosylated CT (GCT) were confirmed after 14 h of incubation at 37 °C by reversed-phase HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of an aliquot of the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was diluted and used directly in a fluorescence-based solid-phase assay. Synthesis and Biotinylation of Glycopeptides—The glycopeptide precursor GP-1, modeled after amino acids 45–62 of human PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) with an α-linked GalNAc residue at Thr57, was synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer as described (49Leppanen A.

The core 2-based O-glycans of GP-4, GP-4′, GP-4″, and GP-4′′′ were synthesized enzymatically as described (50Leppanen A. White S.P. Helin J. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol.

The purified glycopeptides were biotinylated through their N terminus using EZ-Link™ NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (succinimidyl 6′-(biotinamido)-6-hexanamidohexanoate; Pierce). The biotinylated glycopeptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and the concentration of each peptide solution was determined by UV absorbance at 215 nm upon HPLC. The NA2 glycopeptide was prepared from bovine fibrinogen (Sigma). Fibrinogen was digested with Pronase, and the glycopeptide fraction was isolated by concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Sialic acids were removed by treating the glycopeptide with mild acid. The desialylated glycopeptide fraction was biotinylated using EZ-Link™ NHS-LC-LC-Biotin, and free biotin was removed on a concanavalin A affinity column. The amount of the glycopeptide was quantified using the phenol/sulfuric acid assay (52Dubois M. Gilles K. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Nature. 1951; 168: 167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The biotinylated glycopeptide fraction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and found to contain a mixture of glycopeptides with a biantennary N-glycan (NA2) attached to a single asparagine or to an asparagine residue of a dipeptide (NK) or tripeptides (GEN, ENR). Biotinylation and Fixation of HL-60 Cells—Cell-surface proteins of HL-60 cells were biotinylated using EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After biotinylation cells, were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Preparation and Characterization of dGal-1 and mGal-1 and Chemical Cross-linking—Recombinant forms of human wild-type dGal-1 and a mutated form behaving as a monomer upon gel filtration (mGal-1) were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (25Dias-Baruffi M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41282-41293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). mGal-1 (1.3 mg/ml, total of 2 mg) was chemically cross-linked for 30 min at room temperature using a 50-fold molar excess of disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) in PBS containing 0.1 m lactose. The reaction was quenched by addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 50 mm. Disuccinimidyl suberate and Tris were removed using a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). A cross-linked dimer of mGal-1 (cd-mGal-1) was fluorescently labeled using Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described below. After removal of lactose, fluorescently labeled cd-mGal-1 was separated from mGal-1 using an α-lactosyl-agarose column (total of 2 ml; Sigma). After sample loading, the column was washed with 10 ml of PBS and eluted with 20 ml of 1 mm lactose in PBS and 10 ml of 0.1 m lactose in PBS. Eluted fractions were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were detected under UV light (data not shown). 1 mm lactose eluted ∼90% of the mGal-1 and a small amount of the cd-mGal-1, and 0.1 m lactose eluted most of the cd-mGal-1 (purity > 90%) (see Fig. 8B, inset). Purification and Characterization of Bovine Heart dGal-1—Bovine heart dGal-1 was purified essentially as described (53de Waard A. Hickman S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7581-7587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Briles E.B. Gregory W. Fletcher P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, frozen bovine heart was trimmed of fat, cut to small pieces, and minced for 15 s in an Osterizer blender using an S blade (low speed, shred; Sunbeam Products, Inc., Boca Raton, FL). The shredded heart was mixed with 4 liters of cold buffer A (PBS containing 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm benzamidine) and homogenized in several batches (2 min/load) at 4 °C using a blender blade (high speed, liquefy). The homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was washed five times with ∼4 volumes of buffer A, suspended in 1.9 liters of 0.1 m lactose in buffer A, and incubated for ∼15 h at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant (∼2 liters) was dialyzed extensively against cold PBS containing 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol to remove lactose. Bovine dGal-1 was affinity-purified by mixing the supernatant with α-lactosyl-agarose beads (5 ml) overnight at 4 °C in several batches. The α-lactosyl-agarose beads containing bound bovine dGal-1 were isolated by centrifugation and washed in a column with PBS until the UV absorbance at 280 nm was <0.1. Bound dGal-1 was eluted using 0.1 m lactose in PBS. Eluted fractions contained bovine dGal-1 as a major"

To explain the mechanistic basis of this divergence, we searched for differences in the kinetics of phosphorylation and/or in the subcellular localization of ERKs in response to 17β-estradiol in the two cell types. In contrast to its transient effect on ERK phosphorylation in osteocytic cells (return to base line by 30 min), 17β-estradiol-induced ERK phosphorylation in osteoclasts was sustained for at least 24 h following exposure to the hormone. Conversion of sustained ERK phosphorylation to transient, by means of cholera toxin-induced activation of the adenylate cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway, abrogated the pro-apoptotic effect of 17β-estradiol on osteoclasts. Conversely, prolongation of ERK activation in osteocytes, by means of leptomycin B-induced inhibition of ERK export from the nucleus or overexpression of a green fluorescent protein-ERK2 mutant that resides permanently in the nucleus, converted the anti-apoptotic effect of 17β-estradiol to a pro-apoptotic one. These findings indicate that the kinetics of ERK phosphorylation and the length of time that phospho-ERKs are retained in the nucleus are responsible for pro-versus anti-apoptotic effects of estrogen on different cell types of bone and perhaps their many other target tissues.

Sex steroids prevent bone loss by suppressing the rate of bone turnover and maintaining a focal balance between bone formation and resorption (1Manolagas S.C. Endocr.

Suppression of bone turnover results from the attenuating effects of sex steroids on the birth rate of osteoblast and osteoclast progenitors. Maintenance of a focal balance between formation and resorption results from opposing effects on the life span of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, an anti-apoptotic effect on the former and a pro-apoptotic effect on the latter cell type (1Manolagas S.C.

As in osteoblasts, sex steroids exert anti-apoptotic effects on osteocytes, which are former osteoblasts entombed in the mineralized bone matrix and forming an extensive cell communication network that perceives and responds to mechanical strains by compensatory bone augmentation and reduction (5Aarden E.M.

Phosphorylation of cytoplasmic kinases and their transport to the nucleus leads in turn to the modulation of the activity of transcription factors such as Elk-1, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β, and cAMP-response element-binding protein or c-Jun/c-Fos, which are also required for the anti-apoptotic actions of sex steroids.

In our earlier work, 4-estren-3α,17β-diol, a synthetic ligand of the estrogen receptor (ER) or androgen receptor that reproduces the non-genotropic effects of classical sex steroids with minimal effects on classical transcription, was as potent as estradiol or 5α-dihydrotestosterone not only in protecting osteoblasts/osteocytes from apoptosis but also in promoting osteoclast apoptosis. Conversely, 1,2,5-tris(4-hydroxylphenyl)-4-proylpyrazole, a compound that has potent classical transcriptional activity but minimal effects on ERK or JNK kinases, did not affect osteoclast (or osteoblast) apoptosis. These lines of evidence strongly suggest that the pro-apoptotic effect of estrogens on osteoclasts, similar to their anti-apoptotic effect on osteoblasts, is mediated by a nongenotropic mechanism of receptor action that, as we show herein, also involves ERK activation. In general, activation of ERK1/2 leads to cell survival, whereas activation of JNK or p38 induces apoptosis (18Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there is evidence that in several cell types, ERKs may also transmit pro-apoptotic signals (19Stanciu M. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol.

All the constructs used in this study have been shown to produce functional proteins. Cell Culture—Osteoclasts were formed in ex vivo cultures of non-adherent murine bone marrow aspirates (devoid of stromal/osteoblastic cells) from 7-week-old C57Bl mice or RAW264.7 cells stimulated with 30 ng/ml M-CSF and 30 ng/ml soluble RANKL in minimum essential medium α with 10% fetal bovine serum, as described previously (9Weinstein R.S.

Cells were cultured in phenol red-free minimum essential medium α supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 2.5% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 1–2 × 104 cells/cm2 on collagen type I-coated plates, as described previously (10Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—The phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 in bone marrow-derived osteoclasts was determined by immunoblotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing tyrosine phosphorylated ERK1/2 or a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing total ERK1/2 followed by incubation with either an anti-mouse or an anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Quantitation of the intensity of the bands in the autoradiograms was performed using a VersaDoc™ imaging system (Bio-Rad). Quantification of Apoptotic Cells—MLO-Y4 cells were treated with vehicle or 1 ng/ml leptomycin B alone or in combination with 50 μm PD98059 for 30 min followed by a 30-min treatment with 10–7 m estradiol. Subsequently, vehicle or 50 μm etoposide was added and cells were incubated for an additional 6 h. Apoptotic cells were quantified by trypan blue uptake, as described previously (10Plotkin L.I.

The effect of wild-type or GFP-ERK2 mutants on the anti-apoptotic actions of estradiol was determined by evaluating the nuclear morphology of cells transiently transfected with the GFP-ERK2 constructs together with wild-type MEK to anchor inactive ERK2 in the cytoplasm and nRFP to allow the localization of the cell nuclei, as described previously (14Kousteni S.

Apoptosis of osteoclasts, derived from bone marrow cells cultured with 30 ng/ml M-CSF and 30 ng/ml soluble RANKL, was quantified by assessing changes in cell morphology following staining with tartrate-resistant alkaline phosphatase and hematoxylin counterstaining. Transient Transfection and Subcellular Localization of ERK2— MLO-Y4 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) with GFP-ERK2 and wild-type MEK along with nRFP. Following transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h. Subsequently, they were serum-starved by culturing in the presence of 2% bovine serum albumin for 4 h and treated with vehicle or 10–7 m estradiol for various time periods. Cells were then fixed in neutral buffer formalin for 8 min. In the experiment showing the effect of leptomycin B in the subcellular localization of GFP-ERK2, 48 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 40 min in the absence or in the presence of 1 ng/ml leptomycin B. This was followed by the addition of 10–7 m estradiol and incubation for an additional 5 min. The percentage of cells showing nuclear accumulation of GFP-ERK2 was quantified (using a fluorescence microscope) by enumerating cells exhibiting increased GFP in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm. At least 250 cells from fields selected by systematic random sampling were examined for each experimental condition. RAW264.7 cells (1 × 106) were cultured for 2 days in the presence of 30 ng/ml RANKL and M-CSF in 10-cm cell culture dishes. Cells were then trypsinized, replated in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF, and co-transfected 24 h later with GFP-ERK2, wild-type MEK, and nRFP using Lipofectamine Plus. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or 10–8 m estradiol. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Student-Neuman-Keuls method was used to estimate the level of significance of differences between means. Induction of ERK Phosphorylation Is Required for the Pro-apoptotic Effect of Estradiol on Osteoclasts—In cultures of mature bone marrow-derived osteoclasts, estradiol induced ERK phosphorylation within 15 min of treatment, and the magnitude of this effect increased progressively thereafter for at least 24 h (Fig. 1A). U0126, an inhibitor of MEK, at an ERK phosphorylation-inhibiting concentration (Fig. 1B), abrogated the pro-apoptotic effect of estradiol in osteoclasts (Fig. 1C), indicating that the pro-apoptotic effect of sex steroids on osteoclasts, like their anti-apoptotic effects on osteoblasts, requires ERK signaling. However, the time kinetics and pattern of sustained ERK phosphorylation for at least 24 h seen in osteoclasts is completely distinct from the transient ERK phosphorylation we have extensively documented previously in several osteoblastic and osteocytic cell lines, including MLO-Y4 cells (14Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han K. DiGregorio G. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C.

In all these cell types, ERK phosphorylation in response to estradiol is detectable by 2 min, reaches a peak by 5 min, and returns to base line by 30 min. Sustained Versus Transient Nuclear Accumulation of ERK2 in Osteoclasts and Osteocytes—In osteoblastic/osteocytic cells, estradiol or 5α-dihydrotestosterone not only induces rapid phosphorylation of ERKs but also causes rapid translocation of the phosphorylated kinase into the nucleus (13Kousteni S. Han L. Chen J-R. Almeida M. Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I.

Cell. 2001; 104: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding, together with evidence that cell survival can depend on the duration of ERK nuclear accumulation (21Recchia I. Rucci N. Funari A. Migliaccio S. Taranta A. Longo M. Kneissel M. Susa M. Fabbro D. Teti A. Bone (N. Y.). 2004; 34: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), prompted us to compare the kinetics of this phenomenon in osteoclasts and osteocytes (Fig. 2). To this end, osteoclasts derived from the RAW264.7 monocytic cell line as well as MLO-Y4 cells were transiently co-transfected with constructs containing GFP-ERK2, MEK, and nRFP. Subsequently, cells were exposed for different lengths of time to estradiol. Using epifluorescence microscopy, we followed the kinetics of the subcellular localization of GFP-ERK2 in response to estradiol treatment and determined the percentage of cells exhibiting accumulation of GFP-ERK2 in the nucleus. In osteoclasts, ERK2 nuclear accumulation occurred rapidly (within 2 min) and increased progressively thereafter over a 24-h period (Fig. 2A). The kinetics of ERK nuclear accumulation in response to estradiol in a single osteoclast over a 3-h time period are depicted in Fig. 2B. Prior to estradiol exposure, GFP-ERK2 exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. However, as early as 2 min after the addition of estradiol into the cultures, the green fluorescence condensed within discrete regions corresponding to the red fluorescence-labeled nuclei. The intensity of the foci of green fluorescence increased progressively over the next 3 h, with a corresponding decrease in the fluorescence seen in the cytoplasm. By contrast, in the case of osteocytes, after an initial progressive increase for a 2-h period, ERK2 accumulation declined subsequently to reach base-line levels by 4 h (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Kinetics of estradiol-induced nuclear translocation of ERKs in osteoclasts and MLO-Y4 osteocytes. A, RAW264.7-derived osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF were transiently transfected with the GFP-ERK2 fusion protein along with MEK and nRFP. Cells were then treated with vehicle or 10–8 m estradiol (E2) for the indicated periods of time. B, the kinetics of nuclear ERK accumulation in response to estradiol were followed in a single osteoclast (top panels). nRFP visualization defined the nucleus (middle panels). Phase microscopy of the GFP-ERK2-expressing cell is shown in the bottom panels. C, MLO-Y4 cells were transiently transfected with the GFP-ERK2 fusion protein along with MEK and nRFP. Transfected cells were maintained in minimum essential medium α containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 4 h and treated with vehicle or 10–7 m estradiol (E2) for the indicated times. The data presented (percentage of cells with nuclear accumulation of ERK2 expressed relative to the total number of transfected cells in each well) are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. *, p < 0.05 for estradiol-versus vehicle-treated cultures by one-way ANOVA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cholera Toxin Converts Sustained Phosphorylation of ERKs by Estradiol to Transient and Abrogates the Pro-apoptotic Effect of Estradiol in Osteoclasts—To explore the possibility that the opposite effects of estradiol on the fate of osteoclasts and MLO-Y4 cells resulted from the distinct temporal pattern of ERK phosphorylation, we shortened the duration of ERK activation in osteoclasts with cholera toxin, which activates the αs subunit of G proteins, thus leading to constitutive activation of the adenylate cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Activated protein kinase A in turn suppresses ERK phosphorylation (34Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Bland K.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 70-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The temporal pattern of ERK phosphorylation in response to estradiol was converted from sustained to transient in osteoclasts, which were pretreated with cholera toxin as ERK phosphorylation reached a zenith by 5 min, returned to base line by 30 min, and remained low for at least 2 h (Fig. 3A). Cholera toxin by itself had no significant effect on ERK phosphorylation over vehicle-treated cells. In support of our hypothesis, conversion of the temporal pattern of estradiol-induced ERK phosphorylation from sustained to transient was associated with a complete abrogation of the pro-apoptotic effect of estradiol (Fig. 3B). Prolonging Nuclear Accumulation of Activated ERKs in MLO-Y4 Cells Converts the Anti-apoptotic Effect of Estradiol to Pro-apoptotic—Finally, we examined whether prolonging the nuclear retention of phosphorylated ERKs altered the anti-apoptotic effect of estradiol in osteocytes. In this experiment, nuclear retention of ERKs was accomplished by pre-treating MLO-Y4 cells with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of chromosomal region maintenance 1/exportin 1-mediated nuclear export of proteins (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, addition of leptomycin B had no effect on the survival of vehicle-treated MLO-Y4 cells. Strikingly however, estradiol stimulated apoptosis in the presence of leptomycin B. Furthermore, in leptomycin B-treated MLO-Y4 cells, estradiol could no longer prevent the pro-apoptotic effect of etoposide. Pretreatment of MLO-Y4 osteocytes with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 abolished the pro-apoptotic effect of the hormone in the presence of leptomycin B. The latter finding strongly suggested that the pro-apoptotic effect of estradiol in leptomycin B-treated cells did indeed depend on the nuclear retention of phosphorylated ERKs, or at least ERK-regulated proteins, which are retained in the nucleus in leptomycin B-treated cells. To determine whether the subcellular localization of phosphorylated ERKs (as opposed to ERK-regulated proteins) dictates the pro-versus the anti-apoptotic effects of estradiol, we transfected MLO-Y4 cells with GFP-ERK2 or GFP-ERK2 mutants that accumulate either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). In these mutants, substitution of residues 312–319 of ERK2 to alanines has been shown to prevent the cytosolic retention and association of ERK2 with MEK1 without affecting ERK activation, whereas substitution of residues 321–327 to alanines impairs nuclear translocation of ERK2 (31Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast to the anti-apoptotic effect of estradiol in cells transfected with the wild-type ERK2, in cells transfected with the nuclear-anchored ERK2, estradiol not only failed to prevent etoposide-induced apoptosis but also induced apoptosis by itself (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, in cells transfected with the ERK2 mutant that was localized in the cytoplasm, estradiol had no effect on the survival of transfected cells by itself, and it could not prevent the pro-apoptotic effect of etoposide. The results of the present study demonstrate that estradiol requires ERKs to induce both anti- and pro-apoptotic signals in two distinct cell types, osteocytes and osteoclasts, respectively. The opposite outcome of ERK activation on apoptosis can be explained by differences in the duration of ERK phosphorylation as well as the duration of the accumulation of ERKs in the nucleus. Specifically, we show that one can abolish the pro-apoptotic effect of estradiol in osteoclasts and even convert the anti-apoptotic effect of the hormone in osteocytes into a pro-apoptotic one by altering the temporal pattern of ERK activation and the time that ERKs are retained in the nucleus. Hence, the temporal pattern of ERK activation, rather than the cell context, is the critical determinant of whether ERK activation will lead to survival or apoptosis. In agreement with this conclusion, cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, or RANKL exert potent anti-apoptotic effects on osteoclast progenitors and mature osteoclasts (35Boyce B.F.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the anti-apoptotic properties of cAMP are indeed due to its ability to convert sustained ERK activation into transient (in response to whatever stimuli promote osteoclast death in vivo). Future studies will be required to explore this possibility. We and others had proposed earlier that estrogens suppress osteoclastogenesis by attenuating the production of osteoclastogenic cytokines by stromal/osteoblastic cells and that this effect results from a genotropic action of the ER (2Manolagas S.C. Kousteni S. Jilka R.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2002; 57: 385-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, neutralization of IL-6 with antibodies or knock-out of the IL-6 gene in mice prevents the ovariectomy-induced up-regulation of osteoclast progenitors in the marrow and the increase in osteoclast number in trabecular bone sections and also protects against the loss of bone (8Jilka R.L.

The suppressive effect of estrogens on IL-6 production results from protein-protein interactions between the ER and other transcription factors like NF-kB and CCAAP enhancer-binding protein β (43Bellido T. Jilka R.L. Boyce B.F. Girasole G. Broxmeyer H. Dalrymple S.A. Murray R. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2886-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 44Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol.

Similar trans- or cis-interactions of the ER influence the synthesis of other cytokines involved in osteoclastogenesis, including tumor necrosis factor, M-CSF, and osteoprotegerin (46Srivastava S.

Pacifici R. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In view of the evidence that IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, or RANKL have potent anti-apoptotic effects on osteoclast progenitors and mature osteoclasts, the suppression of osteoclastogenesis by estrogens may be due, at least in part, to an increase of osteoclast apoptosis resulting from the inhibitory effect of estrogens on the production of these cytokines by stromal osteoblastic cells. A pro-apoptotic effect of estrogens on osteoclasts may also result from stimulation of transforming growth factor β, an agent known to induce apoptosis of osteoclasts and their hematopoietic progenitors (16Hughes D.E. Dai A. Tiffee J.C. Li H.H. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the demonstration of direct pro-apoptotic effects of estrogens on osteoclasts in the present report (i.e. effects that were manifested in osteoclast cultures devoid of stromal/osteoblastic cells) argues strongly that at least part of the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of estrogens is exerted directly on osteoclasts. This contention is supported by evidence that the caspase inhibitor DEVD reverses the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of estrogens. 2J.-R. Chen, L. I. Plotkin, J. I. Aguirre, L. Han, R. L. Jilka, S. Kousteni, T. Bellido, and S. C. Manolagas, unpublished observations. Furthermore, it is consistent with the presence of the ER in osteoclasts 2J.-R. Chen, L. I. Plotkin, J. I. Aguirre, L. Han, R. L. Jilka, S. Kousteni, T. Bellido, and S. C. Manolagas, unpublished observations. (49Oursler M.J. Pederson L. Fitzpatrick L. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 2001; 16: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the observation that estrogens modulate the recruitment of myelopoietic osteoclast progenitors through a stromal cell-independent mechanism involving apoptosis (15Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In any event, the fact that the pro-apoptotic effect of estrogens on osteoclasts in our studies was demonstrable in the presence of RANKL and was associated with sustained ERK activation strongly suggest that prolongation of ERK signaling by estrogens in osteoclasts must have overridden the RANKL-induced transient ERK activation signal and thereby reversed the prosurvival effects of the cytokine. Besides ERKs (and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), JNK1 is also phosphorylated by RANKL and is required for the anti-apoptotic effect of the cytokine on osteoclasts (51David J.P. Sabapathy K. Hoffmann O. Idarraga M.H. Wagner E.F. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4317-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, estrogens in the presence of RANKL down-regulate JNK1/c-Jun signaling, an action that mediates their anti-osteoclastogenic properties (52Shevde N.K. Bendixen A.C. Dienger K.M. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that repression of JNK1/c-Jun signaling by estrogens contributes to osteoclast apoptosis in mature osteoclasts, in parallel with sustained ERK activation. 4-Estren-3α,17β-diol, the synthetic ER ligand with minimal genotropic activity, has effects identical to those of estradiol on osteoclast apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and ERK activation is required for these effects (4Kousteni S. Chen J-R. Bellido T. Han L. Ali A.A. O'Brien C. Plotkin L.I. Fu Q. Mancino A.T. Wen Y. Vertino A.M. Powers C.C. Stewart S.A. Ebert R. Parfitt A.M. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C.

Investig. 2003; 111: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This evidence is in full agreement with the notion that nongenotropic rather than genotropic actions of the ER mediate the direct pro-apoptotic effects of natural estrogens on osteoclasts. That such direct and non-genotropic pro-apoptotic effects contribute greatly to the anti-osteoclastogenic effects of estrogens is also strongly supported by the observations that 4-estren-3α,17β-diol suppresses the induction of osteoclastogenesis by exogenous RANKL in bone marrow cultures that are devoid of stromal osteoblastic cells and that this effect of 4-estren-3α,17β-diol is abrogated in the presence of the caspase inhibitor DEVD.2 Recent work by Lean et al. (53Lean J.M. Davies J.T. Fuller K. Jagger C.J. Kirstein B. Partington G.A. Urry Z.L. Chambers T.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) has suggested that estrogens suppress osteoclastogenesis by increasing thiol antioxidants in osteoclasts through an increase in glutathione and thioredoxin reductases. We have confirmed and extended these findings by demonstrating that both the pro-apoptotic effect of estrogens on osteoclasts and their ability to suppress osteoclastogenesis do indeed require glutathione. More importantly, we have determined that the regulation of glutathione and thioredoxin reductases by estrogens are the result of a nongenotropic mechanism of action mediated by cytoplasmic kinases and most likely kinase-mediated transcriptional control of the production of nonprotein thiols (54Chen J.R. Han L. Zimniak P. O'Brien C.A. Bellido T. Kousteni S. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: S284Google Scholar). Hence, the preponderance of existing evidence favors the conclusion that estrogens decrease the number of osteoclasts by shortening the life span of mature osteoclasts as well as by suppressing osteoclastogenesis; the latter is due, at least in part, to direct as well as indirect (cytokine-mediated) effects of the hormone on apoptosis. In conclusion, the results of the present study strongly suggest that the kinetics of ERK phosphorylation and the length of time that phospho-ERKs are retained in the nucleus are responsible for the pro-versus anti-apoptotic effect of estrogens on bone cells, perhaps by determining the activation of a distinct set of transcription factors. Whether this is true for the numerous other cell targets of estrogen action will require future studies. We thank Charles A. O'Brien for helpful discussions, Robyn DeWall for assistance in the writing of the manuscript, and Verenda G. Lowe, Aaron D. Warren, and Kanan Vyas for their technical assistance."

An interaction between the RNAi and the RNA editing pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans has been suggested recently, but the precise mode of interaction remains to be established. In addition, it is unclear whether this interaction is possible in mammalian cells with their somewhat different RNAi pathways. Here we show that ADAR1 and ADAR2, but not ADAR3, avidly bind short interfering RNA (siRNA) without RNA editing. In particular, the cytoplasmic full-length isoform of ADAR1 has the highest affinity among known ADARs, with a subnanomolar dissociation constant. Gene silencing by siRNA is significantly more effective in mouse fibroblasts homozygous for an ADAR1 null mutation than in wild-type cells. In addition, suppression of RNAi effects are detected in fibroblast cells overexpressing functional ADAR1 but not when overexpressing mutant ADAR1 lacking double-stranded RNA-binding domains. These results identify ADAR1 as a cellular factor that limits the efficacy of siRNA in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2133134763,"Apart from its hematopoietic function, erythropoietin (Epo) exerts neuroprotective activity upon reduced oxygenation or ischemia of brain, retina, and spinal cord. To examine whether Epo has an impact on the retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve transection in vivo, we made use of our transgenic mouse line tg21 that constitutively expresses human Epo preferentially in neuronal cells without inducing polycythemia. We show that the tg21 retina expresses human Epo and that RGCs in this mouse line carry the Epo receptor. Upon axotomy, the RGCs of Epo transgenic tg21 mice were protected against degeneration, as compared with wild-type control animals. Western blot analysis revealed decreased phosphorylation levels of STAT-5 and reduced expression of Bcl-XL in RGCs of axotomized tg21 animals, suggesting that the corresponding pathways are not crucial for Epo's neuroprotective activity. Increased phosphorylation levels of ERK-1/-2 and Akt, as well as decreased caspase-3 activity, however, were observed in injured tg21 retinae. Injection of selective inhibitors of ERK-1/-2 (PD98059) or Akt (Wortmannin) pathways into the vitreous space revealed that transgenic Epo protected the RGCs by a pathway involving ERK-1/-2 but not Akt. In view that axotomy-induced degeneration of RGC occurs slowly, and considering the earlier data on the safety and efficacy of Epo in human stroke patients, we predict the clinical implementation of recombinant human Epo not only in patients with acute ischemic stroke, but also with more delayed degenerative neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2091616357,"Stimulations of glucose transport produced by insulin action, contraction, or through a change in cell energy status are mediated by separate signaling pathways. These are the wortmannin-sensitive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway leading to the intermediate Akt and the wortmannin-insensitive AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Electrical stimulation of cardiomyocytes produced a rapid, insulin-like, wortmannin-sensitive stimulation of glucose transport activity, but this occurred without extensive activation of Akt. Although AMPK phosphorylation was increased by contraction, this response was not wortmannin-inhibitable and consequently did not correlate with the wortmannin sensitivity of the transport stimulation. Oxidative metabolism stress due to hypoxia or treatment with oligomycin led to increased AMPK activity with a corresponding increase in glucose transport activity. We show here that these separate signaling pathways converge on GLUT4 trafficking at separate steps. The rate of exocytosis of GLUT4 was rapidly stimulated by insulin, but insulin treatment did not alter the endocytosis rate. Like insulin stimulation, electrical stimulation of contraction led to a stimulation of GLUT4 exocytosis without any marked change in endocytosis. By contrast, after oxidative metabolism stress, no stimulation of GLUT4 exocytosis occurred; instead, this treatment led to a reduction in GLUT4 endocytosis.

Regulation of cellular energy levels and metabolic processes are intricately dependent on the supply of glucose, and there are now known to be multiple mechanisms controlling this supply to specific tissues. Insulin stimulation of glucose transport occurs in response to raised blood glucose or when stimulated storage of glucose, in the form of glycogen and triglyceride, is necessary. A stimulation of glucose uptake is also necessary during metabolic stress such as that which occurs during hypoxia and ischemia. Recent work in this area has identified AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; KRH, Krebs-Ringer-HEPES; AICAR, (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide)-riboside; ZMP, (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide)-riboside-5-phosphate.1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; KRH, Krebs-Ringer-HEPES; AICAR, (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide)-riboside; ZMP, (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide)-riboside-5-phosphate. as the key regulatory intermediate of these processes.

Increased AMPK activity is associated with increased glucose transport in cell lines (3Fryer L.G. Foufelle F. Barnes K. Baldwin S.A. Woods A. Carling D. Biochem.

Evidence from transgenic mice expressing a dominant inhibitory form of AMPK suggest that although AMPK is involved in regulation of hypoxia-induced glucose transport, it may not be involved in the contraction response (7Mu J. Brozinick J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions have been reached in studies on animal models for obesity-related type 2 diabetes (8Barnes B.R. Ryder J.W. Steiler T.L. Fryer L.G. Carling D. Zierath J.R. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2703-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Electrically stimulated contraction of cardiac myocytes also leads to stimulation of glucose transport. This occurs without a marked stimulation of Akt phosphorylation. However, this effect is unlike that occurring in skeletal muscle because it is inhibited by wortmannin (9Till M. Ouwens D.M. Kessler A. Eckel J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346 (Pt 3): 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Exercise has been shown to increase heart muscle AMPK activity, and there is an associated increase in GLUT4 translocation (10Coven D.L. Hu X. Cong L. Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Hardie D.G. Young L.H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E629-E636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but the extent to which this is due to exercise-induced metabolic stress or more directly to increased contractile activity is unclear. Although many early signaling events in insulin action, energy status, and contraction-mediated signaling to GLUT4 are now understood, details on how these processes converge on downstream events have not yet been resolved. One approach to the resolution of convergence points is to determine how signaling changes alter the steps involved in the recycling, back and forth, of GLUT4 between its intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane. Signaling could potentially influence any of these multiple steps. The kinetics of GLUT4 trafficking between the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane compartments have been extensively studied in adipocytes and the 3T3-L1 cell line (11Satoh S. Nishimura H.

It is particularly important to investigate GLUT4 trafficking in these myocyte systems because they integrate stimuli that arise from insulin action, from stress stimuli that lead to activation of AMPK, and from contraction-stimulated signaling. Any net increase in plasma membrane GLUT4 could be due to an increase in exocytosis or a decrease in endocytosis. Trafficking studies in adipocytes have shown that it is mainly the exocytosis limb of the recycling pathway that is insulin-stimulated (11Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J.

The present study examines whether the stimulatory effect of insulin on GLUT4 translocation in cardiomyocytes is likewise due to stimulation of exocytosis. This is not necessarily the case because relatively small insulin-inhibitory effects on GLUT4 endocytosis have been found in adipocytes (12Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, long-term insulin action on adipocytes leads to a loss of cell surface GLUT4 due to an increased rate of endocytosis (19Pryor P.R. Liu S.C. Clark A.E. Yang J. Holman G.D. Tosh D. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a complex cell type such as the cardiac myocyte, in which multiple signaling pathways may converge, one cannot easily predict the site of insulin action on GLUT4 recycling. Therefore, we have examined here whether the divergent signaling pathways that are activated by the stimuli of insulin action, altered energy status, and electrical stimulation impinge on GLUT4 trafficking at the same or differing sites. Cardiomyocyte Isolation and Stimulation—Cardiomyocytes from adult male Wistar rats (260–280 g) were prepared by collagenase digestion (type II; Worthington Biochemicals) by use of a method described previously (20Eckel J.

Cell suspensions were adjusted to ≈10% cytocrit in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer (6 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.2 mm NaHPO4, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 128 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES) with 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science). Cell stimulation by insulin was for 2–30 min at 5–30 nm. Stimulation by hypoxia was induced by incubation in KRH buffer that had been pre-gassed with nitrogen for 30 min. The nitrogen atmosphere was maintained throughout subsequent incubations. For electrical stimulation of contraction, 1-ml aliquots of cell suspensions at 37 °C, ≈10% cytocrit, were placed in 19-mm diameter polystyrene dishes. A dish lid was added that had attached electrodes that dipped into the cell suspension. Cells were stimulated for 1–5 min, as indicated in the figure legends, at 100 V with a pulse duration of 1 ms and a frequency of 10 Hz. Contraction was monitored under a microscope. Glucose Transport Activity—1-ml aliquots of cardiomyocyte suspension at 10% cytocrit in 2% bovine serum albumin-KRH buffer were maintained at 37 °C and continuously gassed with O2. The transport assay was initiated by the addition of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (100 μm final concentration) containing 0.5 μCi of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (Amersham Biosciences). Sugar uptake was terminated after 10 min by transferring the cell suspension to microfuge tubes containing 400 μm phloretin in KRH buffer. Background activity was determined by addition of cells to tubes that contained 2-deoxy-d-glucose premixed with phloretin. The samples were immediately centrifuged at 3,500 × g for 1 min. The supernatants were removed, and the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of KRH buffer containing 400 μm phloretin. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, and aliquots were taken for determination of radioactivity and protein levels. Akt and AMPK Phosphorylation—1-ml aliquots of cardiomyocytes (≈10% cytocrit) were homogenized with 20 complete strokes at 900 revolutions/min in a 5-ml tight-fitting Teflon homogenizer and at 4 °C in 250 μl of HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 255 mm sucrose) plus protease inhibitors (antipain, pepstatin A, and leupeptin; each at 1 μg/ml), 100 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaMO4, 200 μm Na3VO4, 50 nm cypermethrin, 5 μm dephostain, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 10 pm nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1; Calbiochem). The homogenized samples were then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 rpm. 40-μg samples of supernatant protein were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted using anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr172), anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308), and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) (Cell Signaling). In each case, signals were detected by ECL or advance ECL and quantified using an Optichem detector with associated software (Ultra Violet Products). Trafficking of Transferrin Receptors—0.5-ml aliquots of cardiomyocytes under basal conditions or after pre-treatment with 5 μm oligomycin for 60 min at 37 °C were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated transferrin (2.5 μg/ml; Jackson Laboratories) for an additional 60 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed to remove non-bound transferrin and maintained at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends. The oligomycin-pre-treated cells were maintained in the presence of oligomycin through all incubations. At the indicated times, cells were rapidly cooled on ice and by adding ice-cold KRH buffer. They were then treated with a solution containing 500 mm NaCl and 200 mm acetic acid (pH 2.8) for 8 min at 4 °C and washed three times in KRH buffer at 4 °C. Backgrounds were determined from samples incubated with competing 2.5 mg/ml holo transferrin. Transferrin uptake was determined by measuring the cell-associated peroxidase activity as described previously (22Shepherd P.R. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Trafficking of Photolabeled GLUT4—Cardiomyocytes under basal conditions or after treatment with insulin, oligomycin, or electrically stimulated contraction were prepared as indicated in the figure legends. 1-ml aliquots of cell suspension at 10% cytocrit were transferred to 35-mm-diameter polystyrene dishes cooled to 18 °C to slow transporter recycling. The photolabeling reagent GP15 (13Yang J. Hodel A. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6559-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Hashimoto M. Yang J.

Cells were then irradiated at a wavelength of 300–350 nm for 1 min in a Rayonet RPR-100 reactor. After irradiation, cell aliquots for each condition were recombined, transferred to 50-ml tubes, washed once with 50 ml of KRH buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm glucose to remove excess reagent, and then washed twice with 50 ml of KRH buffer (pH 7.4) also containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm glucose. For internalization experiments, the washed cells were then redivided into 1-ml aliquots at 10% cytocrit and incubated at 37 °C. The maximum internalization signal was determined in each experiment from an insulin-stimulated sample that was returned to the basal state and allowed to internalize the biotinylated GLUT4 for 40 min. At the indicated internalization time points, neutravidin (100 μg/ml; Pierce) was added for 5 min at 37 °C to block those transporters that were still at the cell surface. The cells were then washed three times in 25 ml of ice-cold KRH buffer. For the comparison of internalization rates, the biotin signal that escaped the surface neutravidin treatment was quantified as described below, and data are presented as a percentage of the maximum internalization. For exocytosis experiments, insulin-stimulated cells were labeled and subsequently washed to remove insulin. They were then maintained at 37 °C for 40 min to obtain maximal internalization. They were then restimulated with insulin or oligomycin or by electrical contraction in the presence of neutravidin. The extent of loss of the internal transporters, as they became quenched by the surface neutravidin, was determined at the indicated time points. To terminate the exocytosis, the cells were washed three times in 25 ml of ice-cold KRH buffer. The data are presented as a percentage of the maximum internalized biotinylated GLUT4 signal present at the beginning of the time course. The fractional change (f) in GLUT4 internalization with time (t) was curvefitted to the equation f = (kex + ken.exp(–t.(ken + kex)))/(ken + kex), and this was used to extract the endocytosis rate constant, ken, as described previously (11Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single exponential function f = exp(–t.kex) was used to calculate the exocytosis rate constant, kex (13Yang J. Hodel A. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6559-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Determination of Levels of Biotinylated GLUT4—After the termination of trafficking and the washing steps described above, the cardiomyocytes were solubilized in 1% Triton, 1% deoxycholic acid, and 0.2% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, with protease inhibitors (antipain, aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin; 1 μg/ml each) and 100 μm 4-(2-amino-ethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride for 50 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The biotinylated transporters from solubilized supernatants were precipitated with 50 μl of 50% slurry of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The streptavidin-agarose beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1% (w/v) Thesit (Sigma), three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) Thesit, and once with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer only. Bound biotinylated GLUT4 was eluted in 30 μl of electophoresis sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) by heating at 95 °C for 30 min. The eluate was collected, and the elution procedure was repeated. The resulting eluates were pooled, 20 mm dithiothreitol was added, and samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. GLUT4 was detected with a polyclonal GLUT4 antibody (24Holman G.D. Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Flower C.J. Saltis J. Habberfield A.D. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18172-18179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody using advance ECL reagents. The chemiluminescence was quantified using an Optichem detector with associated software (Ultra Violet Products). Activation of Signaling via Akt and AMPK Leads to Contrasting Effects on Glucose Transport Activity—Transport of 2-deoxy-d-glucose in cardiomyocytes was stimulated by both insulin and the oxidative metabolism stress that followed hypoxia or treatment of cardiomyocytes with the mitochondrial inhibitor oligomycin (Fig. 1). The increase in transport activity produced in response to oligomycin was clearly evident within 10 min, but thereafter, there was an additional and gradual increase over a further 50 min (Fig. 1A). The effects of insulin and oligomycin were additive and greater than those of either stimulus alone (Fig. 1B). By contrast, electrical stimulation of cardiomyocyte contraction produced a very rapid stimulation of glucose transport activity. The effect occurred within 1 min and was not increased beyond this level by a longer stimulation period of 5 min (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the oligomycin treatment, the combined effects of insulin and electrically stimulated contraction did not produce a stimulation of transport that was greater than that of either stimulus alone. The steps that lead to stimulation of transport in response to cell stress and changes in energy status are now known to be mediated by AMPK (1Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The insulin signaling steps that are known to lead to stimulation of wortmannin-inhibitable glucose transport activity are known to occur via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and downstream activation of Akt (25Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We have therefore examined whether the phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt was altered by oxidative metabolism stress and electrically stimulated contraction of cardiomyocytes. Phospho-AMPK levels were increased 2–3-fold after oxidative metabolism stress induced by hypoxia or after oligomycin treatment. In contrast to the slow increase in stimulated transport activity after oxidative metabolism stress treatment with oligomycin, the increase in phospho-AMPK was similar at 5 and 60 min of stimulation (Fig. 2, A and B). Electrically stimulated contraction produced a comparable response in AMPK levels. Because the glucose transport stimulation produced by contraction was wortmannin-inhibitable, we tested whether the stimulation of AMPK phosphorylation was also wortmannin-sensitive. No inhibition was observed (Fig. 2, A and B). Insulin treatment led to a clear reduction in phospho-AMPK to a level that was only 55% of the basal level. After insulin stimulation, Akt phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 was increased by 20-fold and 10-fold, respectively (Fig. 3). No stimulation of either site occurred after the oxidative metabolism stress induced with oligomycin (Fig. 3) or hypoxia. 2J. Yang and G. D. Holman, unpublished data. Electrical contraction did not lead to an increase in Akt phosphorylation at threonine 308 at all (Fig. 3B) but did lead to a very slight (∼1.4-fold) increase in phosphorylation at serine 473 (Fig. 3C). The slight increase in Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 was reversed by wortmannin treatment (Fig. 3C). However, these effects were very small when compared with the insulin response in the same experiments, and the effects did not reach statistical significance over the number of experiments in which the response was studied. Akt is likely to be present in excess of that needed to activate processes leading to GLUT4 translocation. It may be that a slight activation of Akt is all that is required to account for the contraction-mediated increase in transport. These results are consistent with those reported previously by Till et al. (9Till M. Ouwens D.M. Kessler A. Eckel J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346 (Pt 3): 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). They found that although the glucose transport increase that follows electrical stimulation of cardiomyocytes was wortmannin-sensitive, there was no increase in Akt phosphorylation as determined using the anti-phosphothreonine 308 antibody. However this study did not examine phosphorylation of serine 473. GLUT4 Exocytosis in Cardiomyocytes—The GLUT4 tagging and trafficking kinetic approach that we have used for cardiomyocytes involves use of the biotinylated photolabel GP15. This reagent has three parts. A glucose moiety is present that gives the label high affinity and specificity for GLUT4. A diazirine photolabel group allows covalent tagging of the GLUT4 after UV irradiation. Third, a biotin moiety is attached to the rest of the ligand via a very long spacer. This long spacer is important for binding to avidin in intact cells and in the absence of detergent (23Hashimoto M. Yang J. Holman G.D. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 52-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The avidin only binds to the transporters at the surface. GLUT4 inside the cell escapes this quenching and can be subsequently isolated in a precipitation step using immobilized streptavidin. The streptavidin-precipitated material can then be analyzed by Western blotting for GLUT4 (13Yang J. Hodel A. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6559-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To measure exocytosis in cardiomyocytes, the tagged GLUT4 was first internalized. Avidin was then added to the cells to capture any GLUT4 that was re-translocated back to the plasma membrane upon stimulation. The GLUT4 signal decreased more rapidly in insulin-treated cells than in basal cells (Fig. 4A). Curve-fitting (Fig. 4B) to a simple exponential function then gave the exocytosis rate constant. The exocytosis rate constant of GLUT4 was 3-fold higher in insulin-stimulated cells compared with basal cells (Fig. 5B). These data provide the first evidence that insulin stimulates exocytosis in native animal myocytes. Although this has been inferred from comparisons with adipocytes and from examination of myocytes by microscopy, a direct measurement of the insulin-stimulated exocytosis has not been made previously. As noted previously for the rat adipocyte system (13Yang J. Hodel A. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6559-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), there appeared to be a tendency for the exocytosis curves to depart from a single exponential time course. This may be because of GLUT4 distribution between two intracellular pools (17Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); however, because of the limited number of data points that can be obtained from the cardiomyocytes, we could not clearly resolve whether this was the case.Fig. 5GLUT4 exocytosis in cardiomyocytes is stimulated by electrically induced contraction but not by oxidative metabolism stress. Cardiomyocyte GLUT4 was tagged by labeling with the biotinylated photolabel GP15. The tagged GLUT4 was allowed to internalize for 40 min. Extravidin was then added to the cells to quench the GLUT4 that returned to the surface after stimulation. The remaining GLUT4 was precipitated using immobilized streptavidin and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In A, the rate of decrease in internal GP15-labeled GLUT4 was calculated, and curve-fitting to a single exponential decay function was carried out. The calculated exocytosis rate constants were determined for cells in the basal state (Ba) or in cells that were stimulated by electrical contraction (Ctr) for 5 min after the internalization step. Oxidative metabolism-stressed cells were treated with 10 μm oligomycin (OmO) before and throughout the internalization period and throughout the following exocytosis assay. In B, exocytosis rate constants are compared in cells maintained in the basal state (Ba) or after insulin (Ins), oxidative metabolism stress (OmO), or contraction (Ctr) treatments. Data are the mean ± S.E. from four to seven experiments. *, p < 0.05 (unpaired t test; compared with basal state).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electrical stimulation of contraction also significantly increased the rate of GLUT4 exocytosis (Fig. 5A). The measurements were made over only 20 min in the contracting cells because the effects of contraction reversed after this time. To examine the effects of oligomycin on GLUT4 exocytosis, cells were treated before assay as described in the insulin plus oligomycin reversal experiments (see “Internalization of GLUT4 in Cardiomyocytes”). This pre-treatment with oligomycin was considered necessary because the onset of oligomycin action was slow in comparison with the time course of the exocytosis assay. By contrast to the stimulatory effects of insulin and contraction on GLUT4 exocytosis, oligomycin treatment did not produce an increase in GLUT4 exocytosis. The rate constant calculated (Fig. 5B) was the same as that in basal cells. Internalization of GLUT4 in Cardiomyocytes—Because oligomycin treatment did not increase exocytosis, we examined whether it might alter the internalization of GLUT4 from the cell surface. We first measured the changes in glucose transport activity that followed the removal of an insulin stimulus. The insulin reversal condition was achieved by using a pH 6.0 buffer wash step to remove insulin from its receptor (26Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). After insulin removal, glucose transport activity declined to the basal level over 40 min. The rate of reversal of transport activity was reduced by ∼50% when cells were treated"
https://openalex.org/W2060671481,"We report a mechanism by which the adapter protein Gene 33 (also called RALT and MIG6) regulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. We find that Gene 33 inhibits EGFR autophosphorylation and specifically blunts epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced activation and/or phosphorylation of Ras, ERK, JNK, Akt/PKB, and retinoblastoma protein. The Ack homology domain of Gene 33, which contains the previously identified EGFR binding domain, is both necessary and sufficient for this inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation. The endogenous Gene 33 polypeptide is induced by EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, serum, and dexamethasone (Dex) in Rat 2 rat fibroblasts. Dex induces Gene 33 expression and inhibits EGFR phosphorylation and EGF signaling. RNA interference-mediated silencing of Gene 33 significantly reverses this effect. Overexpression of Gene 33 completely blocks EGF-induced protein and DNA synthesis in Rat 2 cells, whereas gene 33 RNA interference substantially enhances EGF-induced protein and DNA synthesis in Rat 2 cells. Our results indicate that Gene 33 is a physiological feedback inhibitor of the EGFR, functioning to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation and all events induced by EGFR activation. Our results also indicate a role for Gene 33 in the suppression, by Dex, of EGF signaling pathways.

We propose that Gene 33 may function in the cross-talk between EGF signaling and other mitogenic and/or stress signaling pathways. Feedback inhibition and cross-talk among signal transduction networks are regulatory mechanisms critical to the coordination of complex biological activities. Cross-talk can be positive, in which activation of one signaling pathway activates or enhances another. For example, G protein-coupled receptor pathways can often transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; AH, Ack homology; Dex, dexamethasone; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Ack, activated CDC42-associated kinase; MOI, multiplicity of infection. signaling pathway and transmit their signals through the EGFR signaling pathway (1Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Negative cross-talk occurs when the activation of one pathway suppresses the activation of another. Thus, recruitment of the nuclear factor-κB pathway represses activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) group of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), thereby reducing JNK-dependent apoptosis (2Reuther-Madrid J.Y. Kashatus D. Chen S. Li X. Westwick J. Davis R.J. Earp H.S. Wang C.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8175-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whereas some signaling cross-talk occurs rapidly and is mediated by existing signaling elements, some signaling cross-talk occurs more slowly, requiring the production of new elements through stimulus-induced transcription/translation. Glucocorticoids signal by direct activation of the glucocorticoid receptor, which, upon activation, translocates to the nucleus and activates DNA transcription (3McEwan I.J. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Non-transcriptional functions for the glucocorticoid receptor have also been observed (4Bruna A. Nicolas M. Muñoz A. Kyriakis J.M. Caelles C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6035-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, the glucocorticoid receptor can inhibit cytokine activation of JNK via a direct interaction (4Bruna A. Nicolas M. Muñoz A. Kyriakis J.M. Caelles C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6035-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids have long been known to reduce cell proliferation and/or to inhibit mitogenic signaling pathways mediated by a variety of signals, including insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (5Baus E. Andris F. Dubois P.M. Urbain J. Leo O. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4555-4561PubMed Google Scholar, 6Buren J. Liu H.X. Jensen J. Eriksson J.W. Eur. J.

However, the exact mechanisms that underlie these inhibitory effects are poorly understood. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of an osteoblast cell line by blocking MAPK activation through recruitment of protein tyrosine phosphatase (7Hulley P.A. Gordon F. Hough F.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2423-2431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Dex inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin and EGF receptor (8Karasik A. Kahn C.R. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2214-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that regulation of growth factor signaling by Dex occurs at the level of the growth factor receptors themselves. Feedback inhibition is a second mechanism of signaling pathway regulation and is crucial in modulating the intensity and duration of signals generated by receptors (11Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Thus, sustained activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) group of MAPKs is necessary for agonist-induced cell proliferation (13Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). EGF-stimulated ERK activation is often relatively transient, and in fibroblasts, EGF is a less effective mitogen than platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Any of several mechanisms might account for such relatively transient EGF signaling. It has been well documented that the EGFR is subject to ligand-induced down-regulation mediated by receptor internalization and subsequent degradation by lysosome and the ubiquitin/proteasome systems (14Wiley H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 15Sweeney C. Carraway K.L. II I Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another negative regulator of EGFR signaling is the activated CDC42-associated kinase (Ack), which is believed to facilitate EGFR endocytosis (16Yang W. Lo C.G. Dispenza T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17468-17473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Tyrosine and phosphoinositide phosphatases are also important negative regulators of the EGFR (18Graness A. Hanke S. Boehmer F.D. Presek P. Liebmann C. Biochem.

Finally, MAPKs themselves can induce the expression of MAPK phosphatases that function to dephosphorylate and deactivate MAPKs recruited by cell surface receptors (20Byon J.C. Dadke S.S. Rulli S.

Notably, Gene 33 is induced by tissue injury and chronic conditions such as diabetic nephropathy (23Messina J.L. Molecular Biology of Diabetes, Part II.

Although the molecular structure of Gene 33 suggests that it functions as an adapter/scaffold protein (26Makkinje A. Quinn D.A. Chen A. Cadilla C.L. Force T. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17838-17847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), until recently, very little was known about the biological function of Gene 33. It has been shown that Gene 33 is exclusively localized in cytosol and selectively activates co-transfected JNK but not p38 or ERK (26Makkinje A. Quinn D.A. Chen A. Cadilla C.L. Force T. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17838-17847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Gene 33 contains an NH2-terminal Cdc42/Rac interaction and binding domain through which it binds, in a GTP-dependent manner, the small Rho family G protein Cdc42. Gene 33 also binds the phospho-serine binding adapter protein 14-3-3 (26Makkinje A. Quinn D.A. Chen A. Cadilla C.L. Force T. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17838-17847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Overexpressed Gene 33 also binds to the kinase domains of EGFR family receptor Tyr kinases and may act as an inducible feedback inhibitor of signaling by receptors in the EGFR family (30Fiorentino L.

However, the mechanism of this inhibition of EGFR signaling by Gene 33 is unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether these results reflect true physiological functions of Gene 33. In the present study, we used a combination of overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene knockdown to explore the physiological functions of Gene 33. We find that Gene 33 specifically inhibits EGFR autophosphorylation and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling targets, as well as EGF-induced protein and DNA synthesis. In addition, Dex induces Gene 33 expression and inhibits EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation through a mechanism that requires in part Gene 33. These results indicate that Gene 33 is a specific inhibitor of EGFR signaling at the receptor level and that Gene 33 mediates the cross-talk between Dex and EGFR signaling. Antibodies, cDNA Constructs, and Adenoviruses—A polyclonal antibody against Gene 33 was generated by immunizing rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin to which a peptide corresponding to amino acids 445-459 of Gene 33 was complexed. Anti-EGFR, p38, and ERK2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-M2-FLAG monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was prepared from 9E10 hybridoma cells. Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-100), phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, phospho-Akt, phospho-Rb, and total Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Full-length or mutant Gene 33 cDNAs were subcloned into p-CMV5-FLAG or p-CMV5-Myc mammalian expression vector, which expresses, respectively, either an M2-FLAG-tagged or Myc-tagged polypeptide. A recombinant adenoviral construct encoding FLAG-tagged Gene 33 was generated by a method described previously (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding K-Ras was kindly provided by Dr. Joseph Avruch (Massachusetts General Hospital). The cDNA encoding human Her1/EGFR in p-CMV mammalian expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Axel Ullrich (Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry). Cell Culture, Transfection, Adenoviral Infection, and RNA Interference—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and Rat 2 rat fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected by lipofection with Lipofectamine Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Adenoviral infection of Rat 2 cells was performed under serum-free conditions. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50. More than 90% infection efficiency can be achieved at this viral concentration. Cells were then treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) or endothelin (100 nm) for the indicated time period in the case of EGF or for 15 min for endothelin), either with or without a 30-min preincubation with the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor batimastat (1 μm; British Biotechnology) (1Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). For dexamethasone studies, as indicated in the figure legends, cells were treated with dexamethasone (1 μm) for 4 h, after which time cells were treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for the indicated time period. The double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide-based method was used for RNAi. Gene 33 small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides (GUCCUAAAAGCCUUCCGUCdTdT, sense; GACGGAAGGCUUUUAGGACdTdT, antisense), corresponding to the rat sequence, and control green fluorescent protein oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacom Research. After deprotection and annealing, double-stranded siRNAs were oligofected into Rat 2 cells at a final concentration of 100 nm with Oligofectamine Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNAi experiments were repeated six times, unless otherwise indicated. Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, Northern Blot, and GTP-Ras Pull-down Assay—Cells were harvested and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates containing 1 mg of total protein were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h. Beads were then washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, followed by three washes with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1 m LiCl. SDS sample buffer was added to total cell lysates or immunoprecipitation products, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with proper antibodies according to standard protocols. Total cellular RNA was isolated with the Ultraspec total RNA isolation kit from Biotecx. Northern blotting was performed using 10 μg total RNA/sample with 32P-labeled DNA probe of Gene 33, according to standard protocol. GTP-Ras pull-down assays were performed essentially as described previously (33Xu D. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39349-39355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras was detected as its ability to bind, in a GTP-dependent manner, the immobilized minimal Ras binding domain of Raf-1 (RBD; amino acids 51-131) expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer designed to maintain the guanine nucleotide binding status of G proteins (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). Lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated for 30 min with 20 μl of (settled) glutathione-agarose beads to which 20 μg of GST-RBD had been coupled. Beads were quickly washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibody to detect K-Ras. Protein and DNA Synthesis Assay—Protein synthesis and DNA synthesis were measured as [3H]leucine and [3H]thymidine incorporation, respectively. Briefly, subconfluent Rat 2 cells cultured in 12-well plates were serum-starved for 24 h after either adenoviral infection or siRNA transfection as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. During the last 8 h of stimulation, cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) or [3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml). At the end of stimulation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min, and air-dried after two washes with 6% trichloroacetic acid and one wash with water. Cells were then dissolved with 1 ml NaOH (250 mm)/well, harvested, and counted with a liquid scintillation counter. All experiments were performed in triplicate wells. Amino Acid Sequence Alignment—Amino acid sequence alignment was performed using Clone Manager Profession Suite software with BLOSUM 62 scoring matrix. Data Processing—Experiments were repeated at least three times, unless stated otherwise. Representative data are shown. In experiments in which statistics is involved, data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to compare the means of data groups. The significant level was set at 0.05. Gene 33 Binds to the EGFR and Inhibits EGFR Autophosphorylation in HEK 293 Cells—Gene 33 is a cytosolic protein with the attributes of an intracellular adapter. The structure of Gene 33 includes an NH2-terminal Cdc42-Rac interaction and binding domain that mediates GTP-dependent Cdc42 binding. This is followed by several motifs suggestive of binding sites for Src homology-3 domain-containing polypeptides. Binding motifs for 14-3-3 proteins and PDZ domain proteins are also present. Of note, however, Gene 33 includes a COOH-terminal motif highly homologous to the non-catalytic portion of the Ack1 non-receptor Tyr kinase. A region within this Ack homology domain was previously identified as an EGF receptor binding motif (30Fiorentino L. Pertica C. Fiorini M. Talora C. Crescenzi M. Castellani L. Alema S. Benedetti P. Segatto O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7735-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Anastasi S. Fiorentino L. Fiorini M. Fraioli R. Sala G. Castellani L. Alema S. Alimandi M. Segatto O. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4221-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). There is also a short splicing isoform of Gene 33, which lacks a portion of the NH2-terminal region (Fig. 1). Gene 33 has been shown to bind to the intracellular portion of members of the EGF receptor family (30Fiorentino L. Pertica C. Fiorini M. Talora C. Crescenzi M. Castellani L. Alema S. Benedetti P. Segatto O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7735-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Anastasi S. Fiorentino L. Fiorini M. Fraioli R. Sala G. Castellani L. Alema S. Alimandi M. Segatto O. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4221-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding, we overexpressed EGFR with FLAG-tagged Gene 33 in HEK 293 cells and immunoprecipitated Gene 33 with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, EGFR was co-immunoprecipitated with Gene 33. When only FLAG-tagged Gene 33 cDNA was transfected into HEK 293 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, endogenous EGFR also coimmunoprecipitated with the ectopically expressed Gene 33 (Fig. 2B). Of note, Gene 33 appears to bind to both the tyrosinephosphorylated and unphosphorylated EGFR (Fig. 2, A and B). This is consistent with a previous report which showed that the binding of Gene 33 to the EGFR does not require EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Ectopically expressed Gene 33 also appears to stabilize the EGFR, as indicated by elevated EGFR protein levels in cells expressing Gene 33 (Fig. 2A). This phenomenon may be due to the ability of Gene 33 to inhibit EGFR autophosphorylation and consequent internalization and degradation. Consistent with this, we observed a marked reduction in the constitutive autophosphorylation of ectopically expressed EGFR upon co-transfection with Gene 33 (Fig. 2A). To determine whether Gene 33 also inhibits ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, we transfected at high efficiency HEK 293 cells with Gene 33 cDNA and assayed for EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. With the very high transfection efficiency of HEK 293 cells, we were able to observe a significant reduction in EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation upon expression of Gene 33 in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2C). To map the region of Gene 33 that is responsible for the inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation, we co-transfected various FLAG- or MYC-tagged deletion mutants of Gene 33 with the EGFR cDNA and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or MYC antibodies to examine the binding of these mutants to EGFR. We also assessed the effect of these mutants on EGFR autophosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, only the full-length, the short form, and the Gene 33 deletion mutants containing the Ack homology (AH) domain bind to and co-immunoprecipitate with EGFR and inhibit EGFR autophosphorylation. Fig. 3C summarizes the results of Fig. 3, A and B. Our data demonstrate that the AH domain of Gene 33 is necessary and sufficient for inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation by Gene 33. Gene 33 Suppresses the Activation of Downstream Targets of the EGFR—The ability of Gene 33 to inhibit EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation (Figs. 2 and 3) suggested that Gene 33 could also inhibit EGF-induced activation of downstream signaling events. A primary target of the activated EGFR is the Ras-ERK pathway (34Jorissen R.N. Walker F. Pouliot N. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Burgess A.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 31-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of Gene 33 overexpression on EGF-induced Ras and ERK activation. As shown in Fig. 4A, the transient expression of increasing levels of Gene 33 cDNA inhibits EGF-induced activation of HEK 293 cell ERK in a dose-dependent manner. We next co-transfected cDNAs for wild-type FLAG-tagged K-Ras and FLAG-tagged Gene 33 in HEK 293 cells and measured the effect of Gene 33 on EGF-induced K-Ras activation. Activation of Ras involves GTP loading and confers upon Ras the ability of Ras to bind effectors such as the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 in vitro. Accordingly, the amount K-Ras immunoreactivity isolated on immobilized GST-Raf-1 is a measure of K-Ras activation. As shown in Fig. 4B, EGF stimulated an enhanced recovery of K-Ras on GST-Raf-1. Co-expression of Gene 33 with K-Ras completely inhibited K-Ras activation in response to EGF. These data demonstrate that ectopic expression of Gene 33 is able to dramatically inhibit EGF-induced activation of the Ras-ERK pathway. Gene 33 Inhibits EGF-induced Activation of EGFR Autophosphorylation and Downstream Targets of the EGFR in Rat 2 Cells—To confirm our findings from HEK 293 cells and examine whether inhibition of EGFR signaling is a broadly manifested function of Gene 33, we studied the effect of ectopic Gene 33 expression on EGFR signaling in a non-transformed cell line, Rat 2 rat fibroblasts. We introduced Gene 33 into Rat 2 cells with an adenoviral vector encoding full-length Gene 33. An adenoviral vector encoding β-galactosidase was used as control. As shown in Fig. 5, when expressed in Rat 2 cells, Gene 33 was able to blunt EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation, as well as ERK, JNK, and Akt phosphorylation, in a dose-dependent (Fig. 5A, lanes 10-12) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). In contrast, control β-galactosidase virus did not affect EGFR signaling (Fig. 5A, lanes 5-7). Neither control β-galactosidase virus nor Gene 33 virus affected the basal EGFR signaling pathway (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 8 and 9, respectively; Fig. 5B). It should be noted that the effect of ectopic Gene 33 expression on EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation is modest in comparison with ERK activation but is consistent in our experiments. These results confirm our observations from HEK 293 cells and further demonstrate that Gene 33 is able to inhibit EGFR activation as well as the major signaling elements downstream of the EGFR. Note that Gene 33 overexpression in Rat 2 cells also appears to stabilize the EGFR protein level (Fig. 5, A and B), consistent with the results in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). To test the specificity of the effect of Gene 33 on EGFR signaling, we examined the effect of Gene 33 expression on signaling by other receptors, namely, the PDGF receptor and the G protein-coupled receptor for endothelin. Whereas adenovirally expressed Gene 33 significantly inhibited EGF signaling, expression of Gene 33 had no effect on PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation or downstream signaling (Fig. 5C). By contrast, endothelin activation of ERK was substantially reduced upon adenoviral expression of Gene 33 (Fig. 5D). Of note, it has been shown that G protein-coupled receptor agonists such as endothelin can signal by transactivating the EGF receptor, a process thought to be mediated by stimulus-dependent metalloprotease cleavage of heparin-bound EGF, a member of the EGF family (1Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, batimastat, a general matrix metalloprotease inhibitor (MMPI in Fig. 5D) also completely reverses endothelin-1 activation of ERK. Despite this, we observe no detectable increase in phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity upon treatment of Rat 2 cells with endothelin-1, under conditions in which EGF stimulates a strong EGFR autophosphorylation. It is possible that the amount of endothelin-1-stimulated phosphotyrosine is below the detection limit. Indeed, endothelin-1 does not stimulate as strong an activation of ERK as does EGF. The Endogenous Gene 33 Polypeptide Can Be Induced by a Variety of Stimuli—It has been shown that the Gene 33 transcript can be induced by a wide variety of stimuli (23Messina J.L.

Here we isolated CS/DS hybrid chains from shark skin aiming to develop therapeutic agents. Digestion with various chondroitinases showed that both GlcUA- and IdoUA-containing disaccharides are scattered along the polysaccharide chains with an unusually large average molecular mass of 70 kDa. The CS/DS chains were separated into major (80%) and minor (20%) fractions by anion-exchange chromatography. Both fractions had relatively low degrees of sulfation (sulfate/disaccharide molar ratio = 1.17 versus 0.87), showing a unique feature compared with the marine CS and DS isolated to date, most of which are oversulfated. They were highly heterogeneous and characterized by multiple disaccharides including GlcUA-GalNAc, GlcUA-GalNAc(6S), GlcUA-GalNAc(4S), IdoUA-GalNAc(4S), GlcUA-GalNAc(4S,6S), IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S), GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S), and/or IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S), IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S) and novel GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S), where 2S, 4S, and 6S represent 2-O-, 4-O- and 6-O-sulfate, respectively.

DS glycosaminoglycan (GAG) is particularly recognized for its antithrombotic activity, exhibited through a mechanism different from that of heparin (Hep) (5Liaw P.C. Becker D.L. Stafford A.R.

DS often occurs in co-polymeric form with chondroitin sulfate (CS) consisting of varying proportions of -4GlcUAβ1–3GalNAcβ1- and -4IdoUAα1–3GalNAcβ1- variably sulfated on both hexuronic acid and GalNAc residues, thus forming a hybrid structure (6Silbert J.E.

CS and DS have the potential to display enormous structural diversity, comparable to that of HS, thereby embedding multiple overlapping sequences constructed with distinct disaccharide units modified by different patterns of sulfation (7Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity is the structural basis for the diverse biological functions of DS (8Sugahara K.

It has also been our endeavor to look for sources of GAGs with unique structures and prominent activity, which have potential as a therapeutic agent. This pursuit revealed the ability of structurally characterized oversulfated DS, named CS-H, from hagfish notochord (12Ueoka C. Nadanaka S. Seno N. Khoo K-H. Sugahara K. Glycoconj.

It is also noteworthy that DS is being used for other applications such as the preparation of artificial tissues (26Miwa H. Matsuda T. J. Vasc.

In furthering the understanding of DS in relation to its structure and function, especially in light of the recent finding that relatively low sulfated CS/DS hybrids (the sulfate/disaccharide molar ratio (S/unit) = 0.83∼0.84) with a considerable proportion (23∼25%) of non-sulfated units and small proportions (1∼2%) of oversulfated disaccharide units could promote growth factor binding and neurite outgrowth (22Bao X.

Toward that end, DS chains with unique structural features and multiple biological activities were isolated from shark skin, which is an industrial waste with an immense potential to be exploited for pharmaceutical purposes. While a classical preliminary work on GAGs from the skin of blue shark and sandbar shark showed oversulfated DS with an S/unit of 1.42–1.62 and 1.26–1.37, respectively, in addition to hyaluronan (HA) and CS-C by conventional analyses of amino sugars, hexuronic acid, infrared spectrum, rotation etc. (27Seno N.

(Tokyo, Japan). Chondroitinase B preparations were sometimes contaminated with chondro-4-sulfatase and hence each lot was examined for contamination. In addition, chondroitinase B was also obtained from Sigma. Actinase E was from Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). 2-Aminobenzamide (2AB) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) and 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) were from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI). EZ-Link™ biotin-LC-hydrazide was obtained from Pierce. Prepacked disposable PD-10 columns containing Sephadex G-25 (medium) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Tokyo, Japan). Sep-Pak plus Accell™ QMA anion-exchange cartridges were from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA). Recombinant human (rh)-midkine (MK) and rh-fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1 or acidic FGF), expressed in Escherichia coli, were from PeproTech EC LTD (London, England). rh-FGF-2 (basic FGF-2) expressed in E. coli was from Genzyme TECHNE (Minneapolis). rh-FGF-10 expressed in E. coli was provided by Takashi Katsumata (Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Research Center, Osaka). rh-Pleiotrophin (PTN) expressed in E. coli was from RELIA Tech GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). rh-Hep-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) expressed in Sf 21 insect cells, rh-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and rh-glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were from R&D systems (Minneapolis). Recombinant rat (rr)-FGF-16 and recombinant mouse (rm)-FGF-18 were prepared as described earlier (28Danilenko D.M. Montestruque S. Philo J.S. Li T. Hill D. Speakman J. Bahru M. Zhang M. Konishi M.

Human plasma was obtained from Cosmo Bio Company Ltd. (Tokyo). Human thrombin and chromozym TH were obtained from Roche Applied Science (Tokyo). Isolation of GAGs—Skin of the so-called blue shark Prionace glauca (85 g dry weight) was dehydrated and delipidated by extraction with acetone three times, and air-dried thoroughly. It was suspended in water to obtain a slurry and kept in a boiling water bath for 30 min to inactivate proteolytic enzymes. To the slurry, borate-NaOH buffer and CaCl2 were added to give a final concentration of 0.1 m and 10 mm, respectively, and subjected to digestion with a protease (actinase) (2% by weight of the sample) at 60 °C for 24 h, after which fresh actinase (1% by weight of the sample) was added at the end of 24 h and 48 h and digestion continued. After a total of 95 h of digestion, proteins were precipitated by adding 50% trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%, the mixture was centrifuged, and the resultant precipitate was resuspended in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged again. The supernatants were pooled. Excess trichloroacetic acid in the supernatant was removed by extraction with diethyl ether, and the GAGs were precipitated by adding 4 volumes of 80% ethanol containing 5% sodium acetate and left at 4 °C overnight, after which the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dried. Purification of DS—The above precipitate containing GAGs was solubilized in 0.02 m Na2SO4 and precipitated by addition of 10% (w/v) of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) in 0.02 m Na2SO4 and left overnight at room temperature (30Scott J.E. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1960; 8: 145-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flocculent precipitate obtained was redissolved in a solution containing 100: 15 (v/v) 2 m NaCl/ethanol and precipitated by adding 3 volumes of 99.5% ethanol. The above step was repeated three times and finally precipitated from water and dried. A second precipitation was done as above, keeping the critical electrolyte concentration at 0.5 m NaCl to remove HA and enrich the GAGs (31Rodén L. Baker J.R. Cifonelli J.A. Mathews M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 73-140Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Hyaluronidase Digestion—The precipitate obtained with CPC as above was dissolved in 0.02 m acetate buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6, and digested with 50 turbidity reducing units of Streptomyces hyaluronidase at 60 °C for 5 h in a water bath with intermittent shaking (32Park Y. Cho S. Linhardt R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An aliquot of 50 turbidity reducing units of hyaluronidase was further added at the end of 5 h, and digestion continued for another 12 h. After ascertaining the digestion of HA by cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis, the digest was treated with trichloroacetic acid to remove proteins and adjusted to 64% ethanol to precipitate the remaining GAGs. Nitrous Acid Treatment—The precipitate obtained after hyaluronidase digestion was treated with freshly prepared nitrous acid, which was generated by mixing equal volumes of 0.5 mmol of sulfuric acid and 0.5 mmol of barium nitrite, and left at room temperature for 40 min (33Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). An aliquot of freshly prepared nitrous acid was added again and the incubation continued for a further 40 min. The treated sample was neutralized with 0.5 m Na2CO3 and desalted on a column (1 × 56 cm) of Sephadex G-50 using 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The elution was monitored at 210 nm and the fraction eluting at the void volume was pooled and freeze-dried repeatedly by reconstituting in water. Purification of DS Using a C18 Cartridge and an Anion-exchange Cartridge—The desalted, HS-free GAG was passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and eluted with water followed by 100% methanol. This peptide-free DS has been referred to as SS-DS (Native), an abbreviation for shark skin DS. SS-DS (Native) was passed through the anion exchanger cartridge (Waters Sep-Pak plus Accell QMA) and eluted stepwise with 300 mm phosphate buffer containing 0.15, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 m NaCl and desalted on a PD-10 column using 50 mm pyridine acetate buffer, pH 5.0 as an eluent. Disaccharide Composition Analysis—The disaccharide composition was analyzed by digesting with chondroitinase ABC (34Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), B (35Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7204-7212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), or AC-I (36Yamada S. Sugahara K. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2003; 213: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μgor3.6 μg of the SS-DS preparation was digested with either 10 milli-international units of chondroitinase ABC, 5 milli-international units of chondroitinase AC-I, or 2 milli-international units of chondroitinase B, and then each digest was individually labeled with 2AB according to the method of Kinoshita and Sugahara (37Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), except that excess 2AB was removed by repeated extraction with a water/chloroform mixture (1:1, v/v) (38Kawashima H. Atarashi K. Hirose M. Hirose J. Yamada S. Sugahara K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12921-12930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The 2AB-labeled disaccharides were diluted to 400 μl with 16 mm NaH2PO4 and an aliquot analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC on a PA-03 silica column (YMC-Pack PA, Kyoto, Japan) using a solvent system of 16 and 530 mm NaH2PO4 over a period of 1 h by fluorescent detection. The analysis using 2AB labeling is superior to the conventional method for the following reasons. First, the separation of all three disulfated disaccharides Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(6S), Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(4S) and Δ4,5HexUAα1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) was achieved only after labeling with 2AB (Fig. 1), while unlabeled counterparts, Δ4,5HexUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(4S) and Δ4,5HexUAα1–3GalNAc(4S,6S), were not separated from each other as monitored by measuring absorbance at 232 nm. Second, 2AB-derivatives of Δ4,5HexUAα1–3GlcNAc and Δ4,5HexUAα1–3GalNAc derived from HA and CS, respectively, could be separated (Fig. 1) unlike the non-derivatized counterparts. For digestion with 4- or 6-sulfatases, 1.6 μg of the SS-DS preparation was at first digested with 10 milli-international units of chondroitinase ABC in a total volume of 10 μl. A one-third portion of the chondroitinase ABC digest was subjected to digestion with 10 milli-international units of chondro-4- or chondro-6-sulfatase, and the digests were labeled with 2AB and analyzed by HPLC employing conditions mentioned above. Gel Filtration Analysis of the Chondroitinase Digests of SS-DS on a Superdex Peptide Column—The SS-DS (Native) preparation (1.0 μg each) was digested with chondroitinase AC-I or B. An equal amount was also sequentially digested with either chondroitinase AC-I followed by B or chondroitinase B followed by AC-I. All the digests were individually labeled with 2AB and excess reagents removed by extraction with a water/chloroform mixture as above. The digests were made up with 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate containing 7% 1-propyl alcohol and analyzed on a Superdex peptide column using the same buffer as eluent at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using fluorescence detection. Molecular Mass Determination—The molecular mass of DS preparations was determined by gel filtration using a column of Superdex 200 (10 × 300 mm) calibrated with molecular mass markers including dextran preparations (average mass: 18.1, 37.5, and 65.5 kDa) and HS from bovine intestinal mucosa (average mass: 6 kDa) (39Yamada S. Okada Y. Ueno M. Iwata S. Deepa S.S. Nishimura S. Fujita M. Die VanI. Hirayabashi Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31877-31886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Vo and Vt were determined using dextran (average mass: 170–200 kDa) and NaCl, respectively. SS-DS preparations (40 μg) were loaded onto the column and eluted with 0.2 m ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, and the fractions collected at a 3-min interval, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in 100 μl of water. An aliquot was taken for estimating GAG using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) according to the method of Chandrasekhar et al. (40Chandrasekhar S. Esterman M.A. Hoffman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), except that the absorbance was read at 525 nm. Interaction Analysis of SS-DS Preparations with Various Growth Factors—This was carried out using IAsys (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK) as previously reported (41Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Initially, the DS preparations were biotinylated at the C terminus using biotin-LC-hydrazide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride as described previously (42Yang B. Yang B.L. Goetinck P.F. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Excess biotinylating reagents were removed by gel filtration on a PD-10 column, and the degree of biotinylation was estimated by the modified protocol of Green (43Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 23c-24cCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), which showed that approximately 2% of the uronic acid residues were derivatized with the biotin tag. Biotinylated DS preparations (10 μg) were immobilized onto the respective cuvettes after coating the surface with streptavidin. The immobilization level measured around 46.3 and 52.4 arc seconds for SS-DS (1.0 m) and SS-DS (1.5 m), which corresponded to 0.31 ng (4.4 fmol) and 0.35 ng (5.0 fmol) of GAG immobilized, respectively, since 600 arc seconds correspond to 1 ng of protein/mm2 in a 4-mm2 cuvette. After washing the cuvette surface with phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (running buffer), it was blocked with 20 μg of bovine serum albumin. The interaction with growth factors, namely FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-10, FGF-16, HB-EGF, PTN, and MK, was then studied. A single binding assay consisted of two phases: (i) an association phase obtained as a result of the binding of the growth factor to the immobilized DS preparation following addition of the growth factor in 200 μl of the running buffer, and (ii) a dissociation phase characterized by dissociation of the bound ligate initiated by addition of 200 μl of the running buffer. The cuvette was regenerated by washing with 200 μl of 1 m NaCl. The stirrer speed was maintained at 80% and the temperature at 25 °C throughout the experiment. The distribution of immobilized SS-DS and of the bound growth factor on the surface of the biosensor cuvette was inspected by the examination of resonance scans, which showed that these molecules were distributed on the sensor surface at all times and therefore were not microaggregated. To determine the kinetics of binding, growth factors were applied to the cuvette at varying concentrations in the running buffer, and dissociation and regeneration carried out as described earlier. Binding parameters were calculated from the association and dissociation phases of the binding reactions using the FASTfit software (Affinity Sensors). A plot of the on-rate constant, kon (obtained from the association analysis) versus the ligand concentration was obtained by a monophasic fit. The slope of the line gives the association rate constant, ka, and the intercept value on the y-axis gives the dissociation rate constant, kd. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, was obtained from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants (kd/ka). Interaction of SS-DS with BDNF and GDNF—Interaction analysis of the binding of BDNF and GDNF to SS-DS (1.5 m) was carried out in a BIAcore J system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) by immobilizing the biotinylated SS-DS (1.5 m) onto a streptavidin-coated sensor chip. Varying concentrations of the respective neurotrophic factors were injected onto the sensor chip at a high flow rate (60 μl/min) and given a period of 3 min for the association phase and 2 min for the dissociation phase. The sensorgrams obtained by injecting various concentrations of neurotrophic factors were overlaid and collectively fitted by global fit using the 1:1 Langmuir binding with mass transfer model of the BIAevaluation 3.1 software for obtaining the kinetic parameters, ka, kd, and Kd. Neurite Outgrowth Promotion Assays of the Purified SS-DS—This was done as reported earlier (13Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Briefly, the coverslips were coated with 600 μlof1.5 μg/ml poly-dl-ornithine (P-ORN) for 2 h at 37 °C and then incubated with 2 μg/well of the SS-DS preparations or equivalent amounts of chondroitinase ABC, AC-I, or B digested-SS-DS preparations and left at 37 °C overnight. The hippocampal neuronal cells freshly isolated from E16 mouse embryos were seeded in Eagle's minimum essential medium at a density of 10,000 cells/mm2 and allowed to grow for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Thereafter the cells were fixed and subjected to immunochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies directed against neurofilament and microtubule-associated protein-2. The immunostained cells on each coverslip were scanned and digitalized with a ×20 objective lens on an optical microscope (BH-2, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (HC-300Z/OL, Olympus). The length of the longest neurite and the number of primary neurites of cells chosen at random was calculated using a morphological analysis software (Mac SCOPE; Mitani Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Assay for Anti-factor IIa Activity—Anti-factor IIa activity or anti-Hep cofactor II (HC-II) activity was measured by incubating 1–10 μg/ml of the SS-DS preparations in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3 containing 227 mm NaCl with 60 μl of normal human plasma and 40 μl of human thrombin (1.2 NIH units/ml) at 25 °C for 1 min in a disposable cuvette (44Sakai S. Kim W.S. Lee I.S. Kim Y.S. Nakamura A. Toida T. Imanari T. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The amidolytic activity of thrombin was determined as a change in absorbance at 405 nm recorded for 100 s after the addition of 100 μlof1.9 μmol/ml chromozym TH. The rate of change of absorbance was proportional to the remaining thrombin activity. Hep and DS from porcine skin were used as positive controls. Determination of Uronic Acid and Neutral Sugars—Uronic acid was estimated by the carbazole reaction of Bitter and Muir (45Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Neutral sugars were estimated by the orcinol method (46Bruckner J. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Isolation and Purification of DS from Shark Skin—GAGs were isolated from shark skin by exhaustive protease digestion followed by ethanol precipitation. The precipitate comprising a crude mixture of GAGs consisted of HA, DS, and a small amount of HS as examined by electrophoresis on a cellulose acetate membrane and disaccharide analysis after digestion with various GAG lyases (data not shown). It was purified further by CPC precipitation followed by digestion with Streptomyces hyaluronidase to remove the bulk of the HA, and nitrous a"
https://openalex.org/W2016340006,"Conserved ATP-dependent proteases ensure the quality control of mitochondrial proteins and control essential steps in mitochondrial biogenesis. Recent studies demonstrated that non-assembled mitochondrially encoded proteins are degraded to peptides and amino acids that are released from mitochondria. Here, we have characterized peptides extruded from mitochondria by mass spectrometry and identified 270 peptides that are exported in an ATP- and temperature-dependent manner. The peptides originate from 51 mitochondrially and nuclearly encoded proteins localized mainly in the matrix and inner membrane, indicating that peptides generated by the activity of all known mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteases can be released from the organelle. Pulse-labeling experiments in logarithmically growing yeast cells revealed that ∼6–12% of preexisting and newly imported proteins is degraded and contribute to this peptide pool. Under respiring conditions, we observed an increased proteolysis of newly imported proteins that suggests a higher turnover rate of respiratory chain components and thereby rationalizes the predominant appearance of representatives of this functional class in the detected peptide pool. These results demonstrated a constant efflux of peptides from mitochondria and provided new insight into the stability of the mitochondrial proteome and the efficiency of mitochondrial biogenesis.

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles whose number, shape, and protein composition varies in different metabolic and differentiation states (1Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 178-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although a number of signaling pathways have been identified that allow the coordination of mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression systems under varying growth conditions (2Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D.

Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), next to nothing is known about the turnover of mitochondrial proteins and the stability of the mitochondrial proteome. Mitochondria harbor a conserved proteolytic system capable of degrading polypeptides to amino acids and therefore have been considered to be a final destination for proteins (6Desautels M. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1869-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Various ATP-dependent proteases ensure the quality control of mitochondrial proteins in different subcompartments and regulate the biogenesis of the organelle (7Bota D.A. Davies K.J.A. Mitochondrion. 2001; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Van Dyck L. Langer T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 825-842Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). They are thought to degrade proteins to peptides that are subsequently degraded to amino acids by only poorly characterized oligopeptidases within mitochondria. The first evidence for a release of peptides from mitochondria came from the observation that peptides derived from mitochondrially encoded proteins were detected at the cell surface of mammalian cells in association with major histocompatibility antigen class I molecules (9Loveland B. Wang C.R. Yonekawa H. Hermel E. Lindahl K.F. Cell. 1990; 60: 971-980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The analysis of the proteolytic breakdown of non-assembled mitochondrial translation products in yeast indeed revealed the quantitative release of degradation products from the organelle (10Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Whereas free amino acids represented ∼70% of the degradation products and are most likely exported from mitochondria by various amino acid transporters in the inner membrane (11Wipf D. Ludewig U. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Koch W. Frommer W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 139-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), two release pathways were identified for peptides composed of 6–20 amino acid residues (10Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The majority of mitochondrial translation products is degraded by the m-AAA protease, a membrane-bound ATP-dependent proteolytic complex exposing its catalytic sites to the matrix (12Arlt H. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W. Langer T. Cell. 1996; 85: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Peptides generated by the yeast m-AAA protease are released to the matrix and transported across the inner membrane by the ABC transporter Mdl1 (13Dean M. Allikmets R. Gerrard B. Stewart C. Kistler A. Shafer B. Michaelis S. Strathern J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a homologue of the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) in the endoplasmic reticulum (14Borst P. Elferink R.O. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). The i-AAA protease, on the other hand, releases peptides generated upon proteolysis of mitochondrial translation products into the intermembrane space (10Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This conserved ATP-dependent proteolytic complex resides in the inner membrane and is composed of Yme1 subunits that expose catalytic sites to the intermembrane space (15Weber E.R. Hanekamp T. Thorsness P.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although these experiments established that peptides are set free from mitochondria, the extent of peptide export as well as the physiological function of released peptides remained unclear. In view of the capability of the mitochondrial proteolytic system to completely degrade polypeptides to amino acid residues, it seems unlikely that mitochondrial peptides are transported to the cytosol for their destruction. Yeast cells lacking the ABC transporter Mdl1 do not exhibit growth deficiencies under non-stress conditions, in agreement with the observation that mitochondrial peptide export is only partially impaired in these cells (10Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Mdl1, on the other hand, increases the sensitivity of yeast cells to reactive oxygen species linking the function of Mdl1 to the cellular resistance toward oxidative stress (17Chloupkova M. LeBard L.S. Koeller D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, Mdl1 associates with the F1FO-ATP synthase in the inner membrane in a nucleotide-dependent manner (18Galluhn D. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38338-38845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), raising the intriguing possibility that peptide export from mitochondria is coupled to the activity of the F1FO-ATP synthase and thereby to the cellular energy metabolism. As only the degradation of non-assembled mitochondrial translation products has been analyzed, it remained unclear whether peptide export is restricted to mitochondrially encoded substrates of AAA proteases in the inner membrane or also includes matrix-localized substrates of other peptidases. Moreover, the stability of the mitochondrial proteome and the extent of peptide export in yeast cells have not been studied so far. In this study, we have therefore analyzed the proteolysis of newly synthesized and preexisting mitochondrial proteins and characterized peptides exported from mitochondria by mass spectrometry. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Cells were grown at 30 °C in YP medium containing glucose (2%) or galactose (2%) or on lactate medium. All strains were derivatives of W303–1A. The Δyme1 strain has been described (16Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). For generation of the strains Δmdl1 (YIA29) and Δmdl1Δyme1 (YIA31), MDL1 and YME1 were deleted by PCR-mediated homologous recombination using a HIS3MX6 and a KanMX6 cassette, respectively. Similarly, the genomic NDE1 gene was modified using a 3HA-HIS3MX6 cassette to allow the expression of a carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged variant of Nde1 in wild type (YSA1) or Δyme1 (YSA2) cells. Monitoring Peptide Export from Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation, further purified using a sucrose density gradient (19Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and resuspended in buffer A (0.6 M sorbitol, 150 mm KCl (pH 7.4), 15 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 13 mm MgSO4, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 3 mm amino acid mix (including all proteinogenic amino acids except methionine, cysteine, tyrosine), 66 μm cysteine, 7 μm tyrosine, 6 mm α-ketoglutarate, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase (0.04 mg/mg mitochondria)). After two additional washing steps using 1 ml of SHKCl buffer (0.6 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl), mitochondria (13.5 mg) were incubated in buffer A (lacking pyruvate kinase) at a concentration of 27 mg/ml for 30 min at 37 or 30 °C to allow proteolysis to occur. Samples were split into supernatant and pellet fractions by centrifugation at 4 °C for 4 min at 16,100 × g. The integrity of the organelles was assessed by immunoblotting using various mitochondrial marker proteins. For ATP depletion, mitochondria were incubated prior to washing for 5 min at 25 °C in buffer A containing apyrase (0.12 units/mg mitochondria) and oligomycin (20 μg/mg mitochondria), but lacking ATP, GTP, α-ketoglutarate, and the ATP regenerating system. After repeated washing, mitochondria were further incubated in the presence of apyrase (0.04 units/mg mitochondria) and oligomycin (2 μg/mg mitochondria). Mitochondrial supernatants (500 μl) were subjected to sizing chromatography at 12 °C using a Sephadex peptide column (7.5/300; Amersham Biosciences) as described (10Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For calibration, mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine in isolated mitochondria in parallel experiments. Eluate fractions containing peptides composed of 6–20 amino acid residues were identified. The corresponding fractions of the large scale preparations were collected and concentrated in an evaporation centrifuge. Peptides in the tube were resuspended in 20 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and further analyzed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. 1The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; HA, hemagglutinin; IM, mitochondrial inner membrane; OM, mitochondrial outer membrane. Control experiments suggested that ∼45% of the detected larger peptides was recovered under these conditions (data not shown). Mass Spectrometry—Liquid chromatography-MS/MS data were acquired on a Q-Tof II quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass). Samples were introduced using the Ultimate nano-LC system (LC Packings). The column setup comprised a 0.3 mm × 1-mm trap column and a 0.075 × 150-mm analytical column, both packed with 3 μm PepMap C18 (LC Packings). Samples (8 μl) were desalted on a trap column for 1 min using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Peptides were eluted onto the analytical column using a gradient of 5–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 90 min at a column flow rate of ∼200 nl/min. The analytical column and the spray emitter (Carbotech) were connected directly, and stable nanospray was established by the application of 1.7–2.0 kV to the distal end of the column. Data-dependent acquisition of MS and MS/MS spectra was controlled by Masslynx software (Micromass). Survey scans of 1 s covered the range from m/z 400 to m/z 1400. Doubly charged ions were selected for MS/MS experiments. In MS/MS mode the mass range from m/z 40 to m/z 1400 was scanned. Micromass-formatted peak lists were generated from the raw data using the Proteinlynx software module; proteins were identified by fragment ion searches against the NCBI non-redundant data base using version 1.9 of the Mascot search engine. Data Evaluation—All assignments with a probability score >30 and average mass deviations of fragment ions <0.25 Da were further analyzed. Probability scores between 20 and 30 were accepted if more than one peptide of a given protein were identified and at least one of these peptides had a score >30. Proteins were only included in the data set if corresponding peptides were identified in at least two of four experiments. A protein was classified as mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial according to published data. The submitochondrial localization is given as previously demonstrated or was predicted based on the following criteria: Only proteins containing at least one predicted transmembrane domain were classified as OM or IM proteins. All peripheral membrane proteins were localized to the intermembrane space or matrix. Functional classification of mitochondrial proteins was based on the functional categories used by the MitoP2 data base (20Andreoli C. Prokisch H. Hortnagel K. Mueller J.C. Munsterkotter M. Scharfe C. Meitinger T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D459-D462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial transcriptome data were retrieved from Ref. 21Ohlmeier S. Kastaniotis A.J. Hiltunen J.K.

Analysis of the Stability of Mitochondrial Proteins—Yeast cells (8 A600 units) were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium supplemented with the carbon sources indicated and labeled with [35S]methionine (300 μCi) either for 14 h or for 10 min. When indicated, mitochondrial or cytosolic protein synthesis was inhibited by incubating cells prior to labeling with chloramphenicol (6 mg/ml) or cycloheximide (1 mg/ml), respectively, for 15 min at 30 °C. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into polypeptides was assessed by the accumulation of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity. Mitochondria were isolated as described above, resuspended in buffer A, and then washed four times with 0.5 ml of cold SHKCl buffer. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended carefully in buffer A (lacking pyruvate kinase) and split into four aliquots that were incubated at 37 °C. At the time points indicated, samples were centrifuged immediately at 4 °C for 4 min at 16,100 × g. The radioactivity present in pellet and supernatant fractions was determined. Stability of Nde1 and Cox2 within Mitochondria—After addition of cycloheximide (1 mg/ml) or chloramphenicol (6 mg/ml) to yeast cells growing logarithmically in lactate medium at 30 °C, cultures were shifted to 37 °C. At the time points indicated, aliquots (10 A600 units) were withdrawn and cells disrupted by glass beads. Mitochondrial membranes were isolated by differential centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antisera directed against Cox2 and Nde1. The peptide C-KNLMTKLEEQDSRRG of Nde1 was used for generation of antibodies in rabbits. Proteolytic Products Derived from Both Mitochondrially and Nuclearly Encoded Polypeptides Are Released from Mitochondria—In an attempt to further characterize the peptides exported from mitochondria, we first tested whether degradation products of nuclearly encoded mitochondrial proteins are extruded from the organelle. Yeast cells logarithmically growing on galactose-containing medium were labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine. Mitochondria were isolated and incubated at various temperatures to examine the release of radioactivity from the organelle (Fig. 1A). We observed a time- and temperature-dependent accumulation of radioactivity in the supernatant (Fig. 1A). At 24 °C, ∼3% of the incorporated [35S]methionine was set free from mitochondria, whereas this value increased to ∼6% at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). A similar amount of radioactivity was released from mitochondria isolated from cells grown on glucose-containing medium (data not shown; see also Fig. 6A). In agreement with our previous findings (10Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), these data indicate proteolysis of mitochondrial proteins. Incorporated [35S]methionine was quantitatively recovered from the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction of a trichloroacetic acid precipitation, whereas the radioactive material released from mitochondria is trichloroacetic acid-soluble, i.e. represents small peptides and amino acid residues (data not shown).Fig. 6Stability of mitochondrial proteins under respiring and fermenting conditions. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C on glucose-(▴) or on lactate-(▪) containing media. A, to monitor the turnover of the mitochondrial proteome, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine overnight. B, to determine the stability of proteins newly imported into mitochondria, cells were radiolabeled for 10 min only. The release of degradation products from isolated mitochondria was assessed at 37 °C as in Fig. 1. Radioactivity in the mitochondrial supernatant fraction is given as percentage of total incorporated radioactivity in both pellet and supernatant fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the radioactivity released from mitochondria were exclusively generated by the proteolytic breakdown of mitochondrial translation products, radioactive material should not accumulate in the supernatant fraction upon inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by chloramphenicol. However, the release of radioactivity from mitochondria was not significantly affected by the presence of chloramphenicol (Fig. 1B). Control experiments revealed that mitochondrial protein synthesis was inhibited under these conditions (Fig. 1C). We have concluded that degradation products of mitochondrially encoded polypeptides represent only a minor fraction of the material released from the organelle. Rather, nuclearly encoded mitochondrial proteins apparently are another source of the released radioactivity. Stability of the Mitochondrial Proteome Assessed by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—These experiments indicated that, in logarithmically growing yeast cells at 37 °C, ∼6% of newly synthesized nuclearly as well as mitochondrially encoded proteins is degraded, followed by the release of the proteolytic breakdown products from the organelle. Proteolysis may be caused by the limited efficiency of mitochondrial biogenesis in general, including import and folding reactions of a large number of proteins. Alternatively, the degradation of a specific subset of mitochondrial proteins may be responsible for the release of a portion of the incorporated [35S]methionine from the organelle. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the stability of the mitochondrial proteome by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Highly purified mitochondria were obtained from logarithmically growing yeast cells and analyzed prior to or after a further incubation for 30 min at 37 °C to allow proteolysis to occur. In parallel, mitochondria were purified after pulse-labeling of yeast cells with [35S]methionine to examine the stability of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins. In agreement with previous findings (22Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Joppich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13207-13212Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), ∼280 protein spots were identified on two-dimensional gels. For quantification of individual protein spots, we compared master gels generated after each electrophoresis had been repeated at least three times. These experiments revealed a remarkable stability of the mitochondrial proteome and did not allow the identification of individual protein spots that were significantly decreased or disappeared after an incubation of the mitochondria at 37 °C (data not shown; see supplemental information). It therefore appears likely that the degradation of a small fraction of a large number, rather than a significant degradation of a small number of polypeptides, accounts for the observed proteolysis of 35S-labeled mitochondrial proteins. Defining the Origin of Peptides Released from Mitochondria— The unambiguous identification of the source of exported proteolytic breakdown products requires the characterization of the peptides released from mitochondria. We therefore performed peptide export experiments on a large scale. Mitochondria were isolated from yeast cells logarithmically growing on non-fermentable carbon sources, and peptides accumulating in the supernatant were fractionated by a peptide gel filtration column. Fractions with peptides consisting of >6 amino acid residues were pooled and analyzed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. To take statistical variations into account, each experiment was repeated four times, and only peptides identified in at least two of four fractionations were considered. These experiments led to the identification of 270 different peptides released from mitochondria that correspond to 51 different proteins (Table I and see supplemental information). 82% of these proteins has been previously localized to mitochondria by various methods, whereas the subcellular localization of 6% has not been determined (Fig. 2A and Table I). Six of the identified peptide sources correspond to non-mitochondrial proteins. Although three of them have also been detected in mitochondria by large scale tandem mass spectrometry (22Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Joppich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These findings confirmed our conclusion that the proteolysis of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins contributes to the peptide pool released from mitochondria and demonstrated that peptides are generated in different mitochondrial subcompartments. To control for the specificity of our procedure, we examined the temperature and ATP dependence of peptide accumulation in the mitochondrial supernatant. Mitochondria were incubated at 30 and 37 °C, and released peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry as before. As expected from our pulse-labeling experiments (Fig. 1A), the number of detected peptides was slightly reduced after lowering the temperature to 30 °C (Fig. 2C). It should be noted, however, that to a large extent the same set of mitochondrial proteins was identified at both temperatures as a source of peptides, indicating that peptides are not predominantly derived from thermolabile mitochondrial proteins. Intramitochondrial ATP levels were reduced by pre-incubation of mitochondria with apyrase and oligomycin prior to shifting the samples to 37 °C. ATP depletion led to a drastically decreased number of detected peptides derived from mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 2D). This is in accordance with our previous studies demonstrating that the generation and export of peptides from mitochondria involves ATP-dependent proteolysis of mitochondrial proteins as well as the ABC transporter Mdl1 in the inner membrane (10Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Characterization of Released Peptides—The large number of detected peptides demonstrates that a heterogeneous pool of peptides is released from mitochondria. Inspection of their amino acid sequences did not reveal any conserved features or sequence motifs. We noted a slight preference for charged, in particular negatively charged, versus hydrophobic amino acid residues but cannot exclude at present that this has technical reasons. The majority of the peptides identified is composed of 8–15 amino acid residues, which is consistent with our purification procedure (Fig. 3A). ∼50% of the released peptides originates from only three mitochondrial proteins (Table I), external NADH dehydrogenase (Nde1), cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (Cox2), and Ylr356w, encoded by an uncharacterized open reading frame. Both Nde1 and Cox2 are anchored to the inner membrane and expose large domains to the intermembrane space, whereas Ylr356w most likely represents an integral membrane protein with four predicted membrane-spanning domains. The detected peptides cover large parts of the corresponding full-length protein, 54.3% of Nde1, 55.4% of Cox2, and 38.1% of Ylr356w (Fig. 3B). A similar sequence coverage was observed for some small mitochondrial proteins, like Stf1, Atp17, or Atp18 (Table I). In general, hydrophobic segments of membrane proteins were hardly represented by peptides detected in the mitochondrial supernatant (Fig. 3B). Their hydrophobicity may cause their preferential loss during the purification procedure. It is therefore conceivable that hydrophobic peptides are also released from mitochondria, resulting in an even higher sequence coverage in the case of multispanning membrane proteins. The majority of proteins, however, is only represented by a few or only one identified pep"
https://openalex.org/W1970422890,"We have reported previously that the expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is elevated in glioblastomas and that expression of FAK promotes the proliferation of glioblastoma cells propagated in either soft agar or in the C.B.17 severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mouse brain. We therefore determined the effect of FAK on cell cycle progression in these cells. We found that overexpression of wild-type FAK promoted exit from G1 in monolayer cultures of glioblastoma cells, enhanced the expression of cyclins D1 and E while reducing the expression of p27Kip1 and p21Waf1, and enhanced the kinase activity of the cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (cdk4) complex. Transfection of the monolayers with a FAK molecule in which the autophosphorylation site is mutated (FAK397F) inhibited exit from G1 and reduced the expression of cyclins D1 and E while enhancing the expression of p27Kip1 and p21Waf1. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated down-regulation of cyclin D1 inhibited the enhancement of cell cycle progression observed on expression of wild-type FAK, whereas siRNA-mediated down-regulation of cyclin E had no effect. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of p27Kip1 overcame the inhibition of cell cycle progression observed on expression of FAK397F, whereas down-regulation of p21Waf1 had no effect. These results were confirmed in vivo in the scid mouse brain xenograft model in which propagation of glioblastoma cells expressing FAK397F resulted in a 50% inhibition of tumor growth and inhibited exit from G1. Taken together, our results indicate that FAK promotes proliferation of glioblastoma cells by enhancing exit from G1 through a mechanism that involves cyclin D1 and p27Kip1.

It has been shown to be activated on clustering of integrin receptors in the cell membrane or by the ligation of multiple growth factor receptors (1Guan J.L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O.

Activation occurs through phosphorylation of Tyr397, either through autophosphorylation or Src-induced phosphorylation (4Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Clustering of integrin receptors occurs during cell attachment, and the receptors localize to focal contacts (early adhesion complexes) where, in a temporally related manner, a signaling complex is assembled which includes FAK as well as cellular Src and other kinases, cytoskeletal proteins, and adaptor molecules (3Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 5Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). In nonmalignant and nontransformed cells, this localization of FAK to focal contacts or focal adhesions (mature adhesion complexes) has been shown to be necessary for its activation, indicating that FAK activation is regulated by integrin receptor engagement or cell adhesion in these cells. In contrast, in malignant or transformed cells, the activation of FAK does not appear to be regulated solely by cell adhesion or integrin receptor engagement. For example, we have shown the activation of FAK (phosphorylation of Tyr397) in glioblastoma cells propagated in suspension, suggesting that the mechanisms governing the activation of FAK in malignant or transformed cells may differ from those utilized by normal cells (7Hecker T.P. Grammer J.R. Gillespie G.Y. Stewart J. Gladson C.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2699-2707PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies examining the role of FAK in proliferation and regulation of the cell cycle have focused largely on NIH3T3 fibroblasts (8Zhao J.-H. Reiske H. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9Zhao J. Pestell R. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4066-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Zhao J. Bian C. Yee K. Chen B.P.C. Chien S. Guan J.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 11: 1503-1515Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In these cells, overexpression of wild-type FAK promotes cell proliferation, as assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling, and this is associated with promotion of the exit from G1 by enhancement of the transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 (9Zhao J. Pestell R. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4066-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Specifically, FAK promotes the binding activity of an Ets transcription factor to the Ets B element in the cyclin D1 promoter and induces expression of the transcription factor, kruppel-like factor 8 (KLF8), which binds a GT box in the cyclin D1 promoter (9Zhao J. Pestell R. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4066-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Zhao J. Bian C. Yee K. Chen B.P.C. Chien S. Guan J.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 11: 1503-1515Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, the activation of ERK was shown to be necessary for FAK-promoted cyclin D1 transcription in the NIH3T3 cells, because the MEK inhibitor PD98059, but not the JNK inhibitor curcumin, inhibited cyclin D1 transcription in cells overexpressing wild-type FAK (9Zhao J. Pestell R. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4066-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of a truncated FAK (FAK-ΔC14), which because of the lack of the carboxyl-terminal 14 residues does not localize to focal adhesions, inhibits BrdUrd labeling. Although the expression of FAK-ΔC14 in the NIH3T3 cells was found to enhance the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21Waf1, p21Waf1 was not necessary for FAK-ΔC14 inhibition of cell cycle progression in these cells. The expression of p27Kip1 was unaltered by the expression of FAK-ΔC14 in the NIH3T3 cells. FAK protein expression is elevated in a number of malignant tumors, including breast and colon cancer (11Cance W.G. Harris J.E. Iacocca M.V. Roche E. Yang X. Chang J. Simkins S. Xu L. Clin.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3962-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and that FAK is sufficient to promote Ras activity in glioblastoma cells propagated in aggregate suspension or as a monolayer (15Hecker T.P. Ding Q. Rege T. Hanks S. Gladson C.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3962-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because constitutively active Ras is known to promote soft agar growth of multiple cell types (16White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 17Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), the ability of FAK to promote soft agar growth is likely caused, at least in part, by its activation of Ras. Because FAK is known to promote proliferation by affecting the cell cycle in NIH3T3 cells, and as it is well established that the expression of molecules that regulate the cell cycle in cancer cells is frequently altered (18Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 19Swanton C. Lancet Oncol. 2004; 5: 27-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), it is possible that the mechanism(s) by which FAK regulates the cell cycle is altered in cancer cells. Here, we report that wild-type FAK promotes the cell cycle progression of glioblastoma cells propagated both in vitro as a monolayer and in vivo in the C.B.17 scid mouse brain. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of wild-type FAK promotes exit from G1 in glioblastoma cells propagated both in vitro as a monolayer and in vivo in the scid mouse brain. In common with the previous findings examining the effects of expression of FAK on normal cells, we found that FAK enhancement of cell proliferation in the glioblastoma cells requires ERK activity, and the promotion of the exit from G1 requires cyclin D1; however, in glioblastoma cells we found that the FAK-mediated regulation of the exit from G1 also involves p27Kip1. Reagents—PD98059, curcumin, and SB202247 were purchased from Calbiochem. The following purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased: anti-integrin αv directed toward the cytoplasmic tail (Chemicon, Temecula, CA); anti-FAK (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); and anti-phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling-New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin B1, anti-p27Kip1, anti-p21Waf1, anti-p57Kip2, and anti-ERK IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

The anti-KLF8 antiserum has been described previously (10Zhao J. Bian C. Yee K. Chen B.P.C. Chien S. Guan J.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 11: 1503-1515Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-phosphospecific retinoblastoma (Rb) [pSer795] IgG and anti-Rb IgG directed toward the carboxyl terminus were purchased (Cell Signaling). Cells and Constructs—U-251MG human glioblastoma cells stably overexpressing wild-type FAK in the tetracycline (TET)-inducible system (OFAK5) and the U-251MG cells stably expressing mutant FAK397F (OFAK397F-clones 18 and 3) in the TET-inducible system, as well as the empty vector clones TRE2, have been described previously (14Wang D.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3962-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Analysis of Mouse Intracerebral Xenograft Tumors—C.B.17 scid mice obtained from the Frederick Cancer Center at the National Cancer Institute were injected intracerebrally with stereotactic assistance at 6 weeks of age with 1 × 106 cells of the OFAK5, OFAK397F-18, or the OFAK397F-3 cell clone, and the injected animals were divided randomly into two groups, as described previously (14Wang D. Grammer J.R. Cobbs C. Stewart J. Liu Z. Hecker T. Rhoden R. Ding Q. Gladson C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Doxycycline (2 mg/ml in saline) or vehicle alone (1 ml of saline) were administered daily by intraperitoneal injection. At 8 days postinjection, mice were euthanized, and the brains were harvested and processed for either FACS analysis or isolation of human tumor cells by magnetic beads; snap frozen for homogenization and immunoblotting; or fixed, as described previously (14Wang D. Grammer J.R. Cobbs C. Stewart J. Liu Z. Hecker T. Rhoden R. Ding Q. Gladson C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a single brain cell suspension for FACS analysis was prepared as follows. Xenograft brains were harvested, placed into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% bovine serum albumin and the following inhibitors: 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm sodium vanadate, and 20 μg/ml TLCK, minced thoroughly (30 min/brain), passed through a 170-μm mesh, resuspended in the above buffer with fresh protease inhibitors; 500,000 cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated mAb anti-human specific MHC Class I IgG (Pharmingen) or with FITC-conjugated mouse IgG isotype control (Pharmingen) (30 min, 4 °C), washed, and subjected to FACS analysis. The mouse IgG isotype control was used to determine the background fluorescence. Magnetic bead isolation of human tumor cells was performed as follows. A single cell suspension of xenograft brain was prepared as above and incubated with mAb anti-human specific MHC Class I IgG that had been coupled to magnetic polystyrene Dynabeads, as recommended by the manufacturer for 30 min at 4 °C (Cellection Pan Mouse IgG kit, Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway). The beads were washed, and the human tumor cells were harvested by DNase treatment, which cleaves the linker molecule, lysed in RIPA lysis buffer 1% deoxycholate, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS in 0.01 m Tris base (pH 7.4) with 0.15 m NaCl) with the above protease inhibitors, centrifuged (35,000 rpm, 4 °C, 1 h), and the protein concentration determined in the supernatant. Brains were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for immunoblot analysis of total brain lysates and then homogenized using a Polytron (Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland) in 2 ml of RIPA lysis buffer with the above protease inhibitors, the lysates centrifuged (35,000 rpm, 4 °C, 1 h), and the concentration of the protein in the supernatant determined. For histologic analysis, brains were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (4 h, 4 °C) followed by immersion in 6% sucrose overnight, then frozen and maintained at –70 °C until sectioning. Tumor volume was assessed as described previously (14Wang D. Grammer J.R. Cobbs C. Stewart J. Liu Z. Hecker T. Rhoden R. Ding Q. Gladson C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); briefly, all brains were serially sectioned, and 8-μm sections were stained every 40 μm with mAb anti-human specific MHC Class I IgG (10 μg/ml, 2 h, 4 °C) (mAb W6/32, Serotec, Inc., Raleigh, NC), followed by a multilink secondary antibody conjugated to biotin and horseradish peroxidase, followed by incubation with streptavidin, and then 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate, as per the instructions in the kit from BioGenex (San Ramon, CA). Digital images were imported into Adobe Photoshop 5.0, stained areas in each section were quantitated as a pixel number, and pixel numbers for all sections from each brain were summed to obtain a total pixel number. The proliferation index or PCNA index was determined as described previously (14Wang D. Grammer J.R. Cobbs C. Stewart J. Liu Z. Hecker T. Rhoden R. Ding Q. Gladson C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); briefly, two sections of each brain were incubated with 1 μg/ml PCNA mAb (1 h, 22 °C), followed by the secondary antibody. The detection procedure was as described above. The percentage of dead or apoptotic cells in each tumor was determined using a TUNEL assay, as described previously (14Wang D. Grammer J.R. Cobbs C. Stewart J. Liu Z. Hecker T. Rhoden R. Ding Q. Gladson C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two tissue sections from each brain were reacted with biotinylated dNTP, plus terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme, followed by biotin, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, and the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate, according to the instructions provided with the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-Frag EL DNA Fragmentation Detection kit (Oncogene Research Products). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were harvested with trypsin, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 70% ethanol, and kept at 4 °C overnight. Fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 40 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) and 40 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (30 min, 22 °C). The cell suspension was then analyzed using a FACScan for DNA content (BD Biosciences, FACS Calibur). BrdUrd Labeling—Cells were treated with doxycycline or vehicle for 4 days and then replated onto vitronectin-coated glass coverslips in serum-containing medium, plus/minus doxycycline and labeled overnight (18 h) with 10 μm BrdUrd. The next morning, cells were fixed, reacted with mAb anti-BrdUrd followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and substrate according the manufacturer's instructions (Oncogene Research Products). The percent of cells with dark brown nuclei were counted in six fields at 10× magnification. Annexin V Apoptosis Assay—The Annexin V assay with propidium iodide labeling was performed on cells in culture as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen). Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with the above protease inhibitors (4 °C, 60 min), centrifuged (35,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C), and the protein concentration determined in the supernatant (20Ling J. Liu Z. Wang D. Gladson C.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Equivalent μg of protein from each lysate were electrophoresed on a disulfide-reduced 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), blocked with 5% buffered bovine serum albumin (3 h, 22°), and then reacted with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by 0.025 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 h, 22 °C), and the membrane was developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For semiquantitative analysis of band intensity, a specific band on the autorad from three different exposures was subjected to densitometric analysis, and the densitometric readings were averaged; the background densitometric reading on the autorad was subtracted. Soft Agar Growth Assays—Anchorage-independent growth assays were performed as described previously (14Wang D. Grammer J.R. Cobbs C. Stewart J. Liu Z. Hecker T. Rhoden R. Ding Q. Gladson C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with doxycycline or vehicle for 4 days, harvested and resuspended in a 0.3% agar (plus/minus doxycycline), poured onto plates containing a layer of 0.5% agar (plus/minus doxycycline), and then maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 14 days. The resulting colonies were counted with a colony being defined as >10 cells. Samples were assayed in replicas of three, and the experiment was repeated twice. siRNA Studies—Commercially available siRNA duplexes directed toward p27Kip1, p21Waf1, p57Kip2, as well as cyclin E were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. siRNA duplexes directed toward cyclin D1 were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Control siRNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Lamin A/C siRNA (Dharmacon) was used to optimize the transfection conditions and efficiency, as described previously (21Ding Q. Stewart Jr., J. Olman M.A. Klobe M. Gladson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39882-39891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Additional controls of nonspecific siRNA duplex or vehicle alone were evaluated and found not to alter p27Kip1, p21Waf1, p57Kip2, cyclin D1, or cyclin E mRNA, and protein expression at the concentration of siRNA found to reduce the specific target message and protein optimally. Immunofluorescence Analysis—The cellular localization of the mutant FAK397F was assessed using immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (21Ding Q. Stewart Jr., J. Olman M.A. Klobe M. Gladson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39882-39891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were propagated in complete medium with 2 μg/ml doxycycline or vehicle for 4 days, harvested with buffered EDTA, resuspended in adhesion assay buffer with 1 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm MnCl2 with 1% bovine serum albumin, and 40,000 cells were plated onto a coverslip coated previously with 5 μg/ml vitronectin (5 h, 37 °C), washed, fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, blocked, and reacted sequentially with both primary antibodies, followed by both secondary antibodies. Cells were viewed and photographed using a Nikon confocal microscope. Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA, as described previously (21Ding Q. Stewart Jr., J. Olman M.A. Klobe M. Gladson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39882-39891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All primers were commercially available and were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out with the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quantitative RT-PCR was performed using 4 μl of the synthesized cDNA, 12.5 μl of SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix, 1 μl of primer, and 7.5 μl of water in a final 25-μl volume. Samples were assayed in triplicate, and the values were normalized to the relative amounts of actin. cdk4 Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assay—This was performed essentially as described previously (22Benzeno S. Narla G. Allina J. Cheng G.Z. Reeves H.L. Banck M.S. Odin J.A. Diehl J.A. Germain D. Friedman S.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3885-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 detergent with 10% glycerol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm sodium vanadate, and 20 μg/ml TLCK (1 h, 4 °C), centrifuged, and 700 μg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-cdk4, mAb anti-cyclin D1, or mouse IgG (overnight, 4 °C). Subsequently, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the Rb kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), resuspended in the Rb kinase buffer with the addition of 10 mm ATP and 0.5 μg of recombinant Rb protein (QED Biosciences, Inc., San Diego), and incubated with gentle shaking (30 min, 30 °C). The kinase assay was stopped with the addition of SDS sample buffer, subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-phosphospecific Rb [pSer795] IgG, stripped, and reprobed with rabbit anti-Rb IgG. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using an unpaired t test (SigmaPlot 2000, SPSS, Inc.). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated two to three times with consistent results. Wild-type FAK Promotes Cell Cycle Progression and BrdUrd Labeling of Glioblastoma Cells Propagated in Vitro as a Monolayer—To investigate the effects of FAK on cell cycle progression of glioblastoma cells, we analyzed the effects of transfection with doxycycline-inducible wild-type FAK (OFAK5) and doxycycline-inducible mutant FAK (FAK397F) of cells grown in monolayer cultures. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was estimated using FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells. These studies were initially performed after serum starvation to synchronize the cell cycle. Under conditions of serum starvation, in which the cells were starved of serum for 2 days (0.4% fetal bovine serum) prior to doxycycline or vehicle administration and then cultured for 4 days in reduced serum (4% fetal bovine serum), the percentage of cells in S phase was higher in doxycycline-induced cells expressing wild-type FAK (26%) than vehicle controls (21%), and the percentage of cells in G0/G1 was lower (48% versus 54%) (Fig. 1, A and B). Under conditions of serum starvation, the percentage of cells in S phase was lower in doxycycline-induced cells expressing FAK397F (10% versus 22%), and the percentage of cells in G0/G1 was higher (74% versus 56%) (Fig. 1, C and D). Similar results were observed when the experiments were performed in complete medium (10% fetal bovine serum). The percentage of cells in S phase was higher on expression of wild-type FAK (46% versus 33%), and the percentage of cells in G0/G1 was lower (40% versus 49%) (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas the percentage of cells in S phase was lower on expression of FAK397F (11.5% versus 31.5%) and the percentage of cells in G0/G1 was higher (73% versus 52%) (Fig. 2, C–F; values for the two mutant FAK397F clones averaged for the histogram in E and F). The percentage of cells in G2/M was not altered on expression of either wild-type or mutant FAK in cells cultured under serum-starved conditions or in complete medium (Figs. 1 and 2). These results are consistent with those of Zhao et al. (8Zhao J.-H. Reiske H. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), who also found that serum starvation did not significantly alter the effect of FAK on cell cycle progression in NIH3T3 cells and indicate that FAK promotes exit from G1 in glioblastoma cells in monolayer culture, This conclusion was supported by the results obtained on analysis of BrdUrd labeling of cells cultured in complete medium, which showed that expression of wild-type FAK resulted in a 58% higher level of BrdUrd labeling than in cells that were not treated with doxycycline (p = 0.001) (Fig. 3) and that expression of FAK397F resulted in a 70% reduction in BrdUrd labeling compared with the cells not treated with doxycycline (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3).Fig. 2FAK promotes cell cycle progression of glioblastoma cells propagated as a monolayer in complete medium. OFAK5, OFAK397F-3, and OFAK397F-18 clones propagated in complete medium were replated, and parallel cultures were administered 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) or vehicle in complete medium for 4 days. Cells were then labeled with propidium iodide and analyzed for DNA content by FACS analysis using a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that the scale for cell number differs in A and C, plus/minus doxycycline administration. In B, E, and F, the percentage of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases is plotted as a histogram, and the statistical significance of differences in each phase when cells were doxycycline treated versus vehicle tr"
https://openalex.org/W2118621423,"The human ABCG2 protein is an important primary active transporter for hydrophobic compounds in several cell types, and its overexpression causes multidrug resistance in tumors. A monoclonal antibody (5D3) recognizes this protein on the cell surface. In ABCG2-expressing cells 5D3 antibody showed a saturable labeling and inhibited ABCG2 transport and ATPase function. However, at low antibody concentrations 5D3 binding to intact cells depended on the actual conformation of the ABCG2 protein. ATP depletion or the addition of the ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143 significantly increased, whereas the vanadate-induced arrest of ABCG2 strongly decreased 5D3 binding. The binding of the 5D3 antibody to a non-functional ABCG2 catalytic center mutant (K86M) in intact cells was not affected by the addition of vanadate but still increased with the addition of Ko143. In isolated membrane fragments the ligand modulation of 5D3 binding to ABCG2 could be analyzed in detail. In this case 5D3 binding was maximum in the presence of ATP, ADP, or Ko143, whereas the non-hydrolysable ATP analog, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (AMP-PNP), and nucleotide trapping by vanadate decreased antibody binding. In membranes expressing the ABCG2-K86M mutant, ATP, ADP, and AMP-PNP decreased, whereas Ko143 increased 5D3 binding. Based on these data we suggest that the 5D3 antibody can be used as a sensitive tool to reveal intramolecular changes, reflecting ATP binding, the formation of a catalytic intermediate, or substrate inhibition within the transport cycle of the ABCG2 protein.

The substrate specificity of ABCG2 partially overlaps with the other major multidrug resistance ABC transporters, MDR1 and human multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1); the compounds transported by ABCG2 are also large, hydrophobic molecules, including mitoxantrone, topotecan, flavopiridol, methotrexate, and Hoechst 33342 (13Litman T.

ABCG2 was found to be physiologically expressed in the liver, small intestine, colon, lung, kidney, adrenal, and sweat glands and in the endothelia of veins and capillaries. The functional characteristics and the tissue distribution of ABCG2 suggest a major role in the tissue protection against xenobiotics (4Maliepaard M. van Gastelen M.A. de Jong L.A.

High level expression of the ABCG2 protein and its fluorescent dye extrusion function has been suggested for the identification of bone marrow stem cells (17Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D.

Moreover, this so called “side population” of progenitor cells, actively extruding the fluorescent Hoechst 33342 dye, seems to contain pluripotent stem cells in a variety of tissue sources (17Zhou S.

The proper detection of the ABCG2 protein would be of major importance in cancer diagnostics as well as in stem cell research and stem cell-based therapeutic developments. The recent development of a monoclonal antibody specifically reacting with the human ABCG2 protein on the cell surface (17Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) has been a major breakthrough in this regard. This antibody was prepared by immunizing mice with intact mouse fibroblasts expressing the human ABCG2. The antibody, named 5D3, was reported to inhibit the Hoechst 33342 dye transport function of ABCG2 in intact cells (22Abbott B.L. Colapietro A.M. Barnes Y. Marini F. Andreeff M. Sorrentino B.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 4594-4601Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and was made commercially available (eBioscience). Similar antibodies have already been prepared against the human MDR1 multidrug transporter (23Mechetner E.B. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5824-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 24Hamada H. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7785-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In the case of MDR1, several of the mAbs reacting with extracellular epitopes were found to inhibit the transport function of the protein, and the reactivity of one of these antibodies, UIC2, was reported to depend on the conformation of the MDR1 protein (23Mechetner E.B.

In the present experiments we have studied the interaction of the anti-ABCG2 monoclonal antibody 5D3 in various cell types expressing the human ABCG2 protein and examined the effects of ABCG2 protein modulators on this interaction. We have also compared these effects to those of cell fixation and/or permeabilization and correlated ABCG2 protein detection with another monoclonal antibody, raised against an intracellular epitope of human ABCG2, BXP-21 (28Maliepaard M. Scheffer G.L. Faneyte I.F. van Gastelen M.A. Pijnenborg A.C. Schinkel A.H. van De Vijver M.J. Scheper R.J. Schellens J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3458-3464PubMed Google Scholar). We also show here that 5D3 binding to ABCG2 in isolated membrane fragments can be analyzed, which allows a detailed investigation of the ligand modulation of antibody binding. We found that the interaction of 5D3 with ABCG2 was strongly dependent on the modulation of the multidrug transporter protein; thus, 5D3 binding to an extracellular ABCG2 epitope was conformation-sensitive. Based on these data and on previous results for the interaction of human MDR1 protein with conformation-sensitive antibodies, we suggest a model for the transport cycle dependence of 5D3 antibody interaction with the ABCG2 protein. Our data indicate that this conformation-sensitive antibody interaction can be applied for studying the molecular mechanism and the detection of ligand interactions of ABCG2. Materials—Mitoxantrone, sodium orthovanadate, propidium iodide, AMP, ADP, AMP-PNP, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Hoechst 33342 was purchased from Molecular Probes. BXP-21 antibody was obtained from Drs. George Scheffer and Rik Scheper (Department of Pathology, Free University, Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cell Lines and Retroviral Transduction—Retrovirus-producing cells and HEK 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The human PLB985 (PLB) cells were kindly provided by Dr. M. Dinauer (Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN), and the MCF-7 parental cells and the MCF-7/MX cells were gifts of Dr. Susan E. Bates (Cancer Therapeutics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Heath, Bethesda, MD). PG13 (29Miller A.D. von Garcia J.V. Suhr N. Lynch C.M. Wilson C. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2220-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The construction of the ABCG2 retroviral vectors and cell transduction methods were described in detail in Ujhelly et al. (30Ujhelly O. Ozvegy C. Varady G. Cervenak J. Homolya L. Grez M. Scheffer G. Roos D. Bates S.E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Nemet K. Hum. Gene Ther. 2003; 14: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transduced cells in some cases were selected by stepwise increases in mitoxantrone or flavopiridol concentrations or single-cell-cloned for the desired level of protein expression. Sf9 cells expressing the ABCG2 protein or its K86M variant were prepared as described previously (31Ozvegy C. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47980-47990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the present study we used the K86M variant introduced into the wild-type (R482) ABCG2 by cloning the NotI-SpeI fragment of pAcUW21-L/K86M-R482G (31Ozvegy C. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47980-47990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) into the corresponding site of the pAcUW21-L/R482 vector. Immunodetection of ABCG2—For immunoblotting, washed cells were suspended in the presence of 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate in 2× Laemmli buffer and sonicated for 3 × 5 s at 4 °C. Sf9 membranes were also suspended in Laemmli buffer. The proteins separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immuno-detection was performed by using the monoclonal antibody BXP-21 (500× dilution) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (5000× dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch). An enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) technique was applied to detect horseradish peroxidase activity on the blots. For measuring ABCG2 expression by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences FACSCalibur) 5D3 primary antibody (purified anti-human ABCG2, clone 5D3, eBioscience catalog number 14-8888) or BXP-21 antibody and phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (GAM-PE, Beckman Coulter) were used. 5D3 binding in intact cells was examined by suspending the cells in phenol red-free Hanks' balanced salt solution with additional pH stabilization by 20 mm phosphate buffer. Aliquots of the suspension containing 3 × 105 cells were incubated with 500× diluted 5D3 primary antibody (1 μg/ml), 100× diluted BXP-21 antibody, or mouse IgG2b (1 μg/ml, as isotype control) in 50 μl of buffer for 45 min at 37 °C (all labeling experiments were carried out in shaker water bath). After washing the cells with Hanks' solution containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, the cells were labeled by 200× diluted goat anti-mouse phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody (GAM-PE, 3 μg/ml), in 50 μl of buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were resuspended in Hanks' medium, and 5D3 binding was determined at 488-nm excitation and 585/42-nm emission (FL2) wavelengths. When the labeling was carried out with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-prefixed cells, the cells were incubated in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C before the above-mentioned labeling procedure. For obtaining PFA-fixed and -permeabilized cells, the cells were incubated in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 37 °C. The same 0.05% Triton X-100 was present during all steps of the labeling procedure. When labeling was carried out in the presence of modifying agents (5 μm Ko143, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μm flavopiridol, or 5 μm mitoxantrone), the cells were preincubated with these agents for 10 min at 37 °C before labeling, and the agents were present during antibody labeling. When applicable, ATP depletion of the cells was carried out before the labeling procedure by washing the cells twice in sugar-free Hanks' medium and 30 min of incubation at 37 °C in Hanks' medium containing 50 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 15 mm sodium azide. During cell labeling and washing the media contained the same ATP-depleting agents. Isolated membrane fragments from Sf9 cells (45 μg) were labeled with 1 μg/ml 5D3 (or mouse IgG2b as isotype control) in the 100-μl final volume of assay mix (40 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mm sodium azide, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μm EGTA-Tris, pH 7.0) for 30 min at 37 °C. The membranes were then washed with 500 μl of assay mix and pelleted at 10,000 × g for 4 min. The pellet was suspended in assay mix containing 1 μg/ml GAM-PE and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The membranes were then washed and centrifuged (10,000 × g for 4 min). Finally, the pellet was suspended in 200 μl of assay mix, and the fluorescence was detected in a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan II, Labsystems) at 485 nm (excitation)/590 nm (emission). When the effects of different agents were investigated the membranes were preincubated in assay mix containing 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm Ko143, 10 mm MgAMP, MgADP, MgAMP-PNP, MgATP, or 10 mm AMP, ADP, AMP-PNP, ATP plus 2 mm EDTA, or the combination of these agents (as described in Fig. 7, panels C and D) for 5 min at 37 °C before the addition of the 5D3 antibody. The relative level of 5D3 binding was calculated as (FX–FIT)/(F0–FIT) × 100, where FX is fluorescence measured in the presence of 5D3 and the investigated compound, FIT is fluorescence measured in the presence of mouse IgG2b (isotype control), and F0 is fluorescence measured in the presence of 5D3 alone. Cellular Mitoxantrone Uptake—The drug extrusion function of ABCG2 in intact cells was evaluated by the mitoxantrone (MX) uptake assay of Robey et al. (32Robey R.W. Honjo Y. van de Laar A. Miyake K. Regis J.T. Litman T. Bates S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1512: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) as modified by Ujhelly et al. (30Ujhelly O. Ozvegy C. Varady G. Cervenak J.

After 5D3 labeling at 37 °C for 30 min and washing (as described for immuno-labeling), the cells were suspended in phenol red-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 μm MX or 5 μm MX plus 5 μm Ko143 (in some experiments 10 mm sodium orthovanadate or 50 μm flavopiridol) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing, MX fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) at 635 nm excitation and 661/16 nm emission wavelengths (FL4). Dead cells were excluded based on propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) staining. Measurement of Hoechst 33342 Transport Activity—Accumulation of Hoechst dye was performed by using intact PLB-ABCG2 (R482), PLB-MDR1, or parental PLB cells (30Ujhelly O. Ozvegy C. Varady G. Cervenak J. Homolya L. Grez M. Scheffer G. Roos D. Bates S.E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Nemet K. Hum. Gene Ther. 2003; 14: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B) at 350 nm (excitation)/460 nm (emission). The cells (3 × 105) were incubated with or without 12 μg of 5D3 antibody in a 100 μl final volume of the transport buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 400 μm MgCl2, 40 μm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm Na2HPO4) at 37 °C for 30 min. Hoechst transport was then determined on 5D3 labeled or non-labeled cells, as described (33Ozvegy-Laczka C. Hegedus T. Varady G. Ujhelly O. Schuetz J.D. Varadi A. Keri G. Orfi L. Nemet K. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). ATPase Activity Measurement—Sf9 membranes containing human ABCG2, MDR1, or ABCG2-K86M were harvested, and their membranes were isolated and stored at –80 °C according to Sarkadi et al. (34Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sarkadi B. Bauzon D. Huckle W.R. Earp H.S. Berry A. Suchindran H. Price E.M. Olson J.C. Boucher R.C. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2087-2095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured as described previously by determining the liberation of inorganic phosphate from ATP with a colorimetric reaction (11Ozvegy C. Litman T. Szakacs G. Nagy Z. Bates S. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). When the effect of antibody binding was investigated, membranes were preincubated with anti-ABCG2 5D3 monoclonal antibody (eBioscience) or mouse IgG2b (isotype control, Sigma) in 20 or 160 μg/mg membrane concentration for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed twice in ice-cold buffer (40 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA) before the ATPase activity measurement. The figures represent the mean values of at least three independent experiments with duplicates. Antibody Detection of ABCG2—For the immuno-detection of the human ABCG2 protein in various cell types we used two monoclonal antibodies. The BXP-21 antibody was generated against an N-terminal intracellular epitope (amino acids 271–396; see Maliepaard et al. (28Maliepaard M. Scheffer G.L. Faneyte I.F. van Gastelen M.A. Pijnenborg A.C. Schinkel A.H. van De Vijver M.J. Scheper R.J. Schellens J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3458-3464PubMed Google Scholar)), whereas mAb 5D3 was produced by immunizing mice with intact mouse fibroblasts expressing the human ABCG2 protein (17Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). As documented earlier, BXP-21 recognizes the ABCG2 protein both in immunoblots and in permeabilized cells (28Maliepaard M. Scheffer G.L. Faneyte I.F. van Gastelen M.A. Pijnenborg A.C. Schinkel A.H. van De Vijver M.J. Scheper R.J. Schellens J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3458-3464PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the 5D3 antibody could be used to recognize human ABCG2 on the surface of intact cells (17Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) but not on immunoblots (see below). Fig. 1 shows immunoblot detection of the human ABCG2 protein in the various cells used in the present study by mAb BXP-21. Panel A shows expression of human, wild-type ABCG2, or the K86M-ABCG2 variant in isolated membranes of Sf9 insect cells (11Ozvegy C. Litman T. Szakacs G. Nagy Z. Bates S. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Panel B shows BXP-21 immunoreactions with cell lysates of PLB cells, engineered to express the wild-type ABCG2 or its K86M mutant variant. The expression level of the K86M variant of ABCG2 was about one-third the expression obtained for the wild-type protein (these cells could not be selected by mitoxantrone; see “Experimental Procedures” and Ozvegy et al. (31Ozvegy C. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47980-47990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). Fig. 1, panel C, documents the retrovirally evoked expression of human ABCG2 in HEK 293T cells, and panel D demonstrates the overexpression of ABCG2 in the mitoxantrone-selected MCF-7 cell derivative (MCF-7/MX), as detected by the BXP-21 antibody. It should be noted that, in accordance with previous results, we did not find any immuno-reactivity of the 5D3 antibody with ABCG2 on immunoblots. Fig. 2 demonstrates the detection of ABCG2 in the parental and the ABCG2-expressing PLB cells, respectively, by flow cytometry and using the BXP-21 and the 5D3 monoclonal antibodies. In these experiments each antibody was used in a concentration of 0.2 μg/106 cells. We found that in the parental PLBs the 5D3 antibody showed no immunoreactivity even if the cells were fixed by PFA or fixed and permeabilized by PFA plus Triton X-100 treatment (Fig. 2, panel A). When parental PLB cells were labeled with the BXP-21 antibody (Fig. 2, panel B), there was some background labeling observed as compared with the isotype control. However, in these parental cells BXP-21 labeling did not increase upon treatment with PFA or PFA plus Triton X-100. As shown in Fig. 2, panel D, in the case of the ABCG2-expressing PLB cells, there was no reaction with the BXP-21 mAb unless the cells were both fixed and Triton-permeabilized. In this latter case a significant, ABCG2-dependent labeling of the cells by BXP-21 was found. In contrast, the 5D3 antibody showed a well visible immunoreactivity with the native ABCG2-expressing PLBs (Fig. 2, panel C). This reactivity was increased by PFA fixation, whereas a further permeabilization with Triton X-100 had no effect on 5D3 binding. It has to be noted that a similar shift in 5D3 reactivity was found upon PFA fixation and independent of membrane permeabilization in all ABCG2-expressing cell types studied, including Sf9 insect cells (not shown here). The 5D3 labeling in this latter cell line indicates that the level or even the absence of N-glycosylation does not influence the interaction of 5D3 antibody with ABCG2. Inhibition of ABCG2 Function by the 5D3 Antibody—The data presented in Fig. 2 were obtained with relatively low concentrations of the 5D3 antibody (0.2 μg/106 cells). By increasing the antibody concentration up to 10 μg/106 cells, a saturable level of ABCG2 labeling could be achieved that was not significantly modified by PFA fixation (Fig. 3A). To investigate the effect of 5D3 on the ABCG2 function, we preincubated the PLB-ABCG2 cells with the 5D3 antibody (40 μg/106 cells) and then measured Hoechst 33342 dye extrusion. As shown in Fig. 3B, at high 5D3 concentrations (40 μg/106 cells), a significant (p = 0.002), about 65% inhibition of dye transport, was observed. In contrast, 5D3 did not inhibit the Hoechst dye transport measured in MDR1-expressing PLBs. In addition, the anti-MDR1 inhibitory monoclonal antibody, UIC2, inhibited Hoechst 33342 extrusion in the MDR1-expressing cells but did not modify the transport activity in the PLB-ABCG2 cells (not shown). To further explore the ABCG2 inhibitory potential and selectivity of the 5D3 antibody, we have performed direct ABCG2-ATPase measurements in isolated Sf9 cell membranes (Fig. 3C). In these experiments we preincubated the isolated membranes for 30 min at 37 °C with two different 5D3 concentrations (20 and 160 μg of 5D3/mg of membrane protein, respectively) in the absence of ATP to assure maximum 5D3 labeling of ABCG2 (see below). We found that the application of the lower, 20 μg/mg membrane 5D3 concentration, although at least 20 times greater than that used in the whole-cell experiments, did not significantly affect the ABCG2-ATPase (p = 0.1). However, when the ATPase activity was measured after labeling with 160 μg of 5D3/mg of membrane protein, a significant (p = 0.007), about 30% decrease in the vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity of ABCG2 was observed. No inhibition was seen in the presence of similar"
https://openalex.org/W2071373642,"In Escherichia coli, the Tat system promotes the membrane translocation of a subset of exported proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Four genes (tatA, tatB, tatC, and tatE) have been identified that encode the components of the E. coli Tat translocation apparatus. Whereas TatA and TatE can functionally substitute for each other, the TatB and the TatC proteins have been shown to perform distinct functions. In contrast to Tat systems of the ABC(E) type found in E. coli and many other bacteria, some microorganisms possess a TatAC-type translocase that consists of TatA and TatC only, suggesting that, in these systems, TatB is not required or that one of the remaining components (TatA or TatC) additionally takes over the TatB function. We have addressed the molecular basis for the difference in subunit composition between TatABC(E) and TatAC-type systems by using a genetic approach. A plasmid-encoded E. coli minimal Tat translocase consisting solely of TatA and TatC was shown to mediate a low level translocation of a sensitive Tat-dependent reporter protein. Suppressor mutations in the minimal Tat translocase were isolated that compensate for the absence of TatB and that showed substantial increases in translocation activities. All of the mutations mapped to the extreme amino-terminal domain of TatA. No mutations affecting TatC were identified. These results suggest that in TatAC-type systems, the TatA protein represents a bifunctional component fulfilling both the TatA and TatB functions. Furthermore, our results indicate that the structure of the amino-terminal domain of TatA is decisive for whether or not TatB is required. In Escherichia coli, the Tat system promotes the membrane translocation of a subset of exported proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane.

All of the mutations mapped to the extreme amino-terminal domain of TatA. No mutations affecting TatC were identified. These results suggest that in TatAC-type systems, the TatA protein represents a bifunctional component fulfilling both the TatA and TatB functions. Furthermore, our results indicate that the structure of the amino-terminal domain of TatA is decisive for whether or not TatB is required. Transport of proteins across biological membranes is a crucial process in all living cells. In eubacteria, the translocation of the vast majority of proteins across the plasma membrane is mediated by the general protein secretion (Sec) system, consisting of a protein-conducting channel (SecYEG) and a translocation motor (SecA). Sec-dependent proteins are threaded through the SecYEG pore in a more or less unfolded state and only fold after their release on the trans-side of the membrane (for a recent review, see Ref. 1van der de Keyzer J. Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2034-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition to the Sec machinery, many bacteria possess a second protein export system, the so-called Tat (twin arginine translocation) system, for the translocation of a subset of proteins. In marked contrast to the Sec system, the Tat machinery translocates its substrates in a fully folded or even oligomeric state (for reviews, see Refs. 2Wu L.-F. Ize B. Chanal A. Quentin Y. Fichant G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 179-189PubMed Google Scholar, 3Robinson C. Bolhuis A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 4Müller M.

Microbiology. 2003; 149: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Tat export machinery consists of a surprisingly low number of components. In Escherichia coli, four genes (tatA, tatB, tatC, and tatE) have been identified that encode components of the Tat translocation apparatus (6Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L.

Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). TatA, TatB, and TatE are sequence-related proteins. TatA and TatE show more than 50% sequence identity and can partially substitute for each other functionally (7Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, because the tatA gene is expressed about 100 times higher than tatE, the latter gene is currently regarded as a cryptic gene duplication of tatA (8Jack R. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Sawers G. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, despite the fact that TatA and TatB show some weak sequence identity, genetic evidence suggests that they perform different functions (9Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Therefore, TatA, TatB, and TatC seem to be the minimal components of the Tat export apparatus in E. coli. So far, very little is known about the mechanism of Tat-mediated protein transport. Biochemical evidence from E. coli (10Alami M. Lüke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H-G. Brunner J. Müller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and from investigations of the homologous ΔpH pathway in plant thylakoids (11Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) suggests that Tat precursor proteins first bind to a complex consisting of TatB and TatC. After interacting with the primary recognition component TatC, the signal peptide seems to be transferred via TatB to the actual translocation pore, presumably consisting of multiple copies of TatA. Recruitment of TatA molecules to the TatBC complex is dependent on the presence of the transmembrane H+ gradient (ΔpH). After transport of the substrate across the membrane plane, the substrate protein is released on the trans-side of the membrane and the pore component TatA redissociates from the TatB-TatC receptor complex, allowing the recycled components to catalyze further rounds of substrate binding and translocation. As described above, the E. coli TatB seems to function as a mediator between substrate recognition by TatC and subsequent translocation events. Genetic evidence clearly showed that the presence of TatB is essential for efficient Tat-dependent protein translocation in E. coli (9Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In contrast to Tat systems of the ABC(E) type, Tat systems of the AC type (found for example in Rickettsia prowazekii, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus) lack TatB (2Wu L.-F. Ize B. Chanal A. Quentin Y. Fichant G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 179-189PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yen M-R. Tseng Y.-H. Nguyen E.H. Wu L.-F. Saier Jr., M.H. Arch.

In the present study, we have addressed the molecular basis for the difference in subunit composition between TatABC(E) and TatAC-type Tat systems by using a genetic approach. A plasmid-encoded E. coli minimal Tat translocase consisting solely of TatA and TatC was found to allow some very low but nevertheless detectable residual translocation of a sensitive Tat reporter protein. Mutants of the minimal Tat translocase were isolated that showed substantial increases in translocation activities. All of the mutational alterations were found to be localized in the extreme amino-terminal domain of the TatA protein. No mutations affecting TatC could be identified. Our results strongly suggest that in Tat systems of the AC type, the TatA protein represents a bifunctional component fulfilling both the mediator activity of TatB as well as the pore-forming function of TatA. Furthermore, our results indicate that the structure of the amino-terminal domain of TatA is decisive whether a TatB mediator is required or not.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the construction of pHSG-TatABCE, plasmid pTatABC (18Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2811-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and PstI, and the tatABC fragment was ligated into BamHI/PstI-digested pACYCtac, 2R. Siewe, unpublished observations. resulting in pACYC-TatABC. The tatE gene was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA of MC4100 as a template and primers TatE-for (5′-CAG ACT GCA GTT GTG TGC GCG CGT CG-3′) and TatE-rev (5′-GAT CTA GAG GGA GCG TCC TGC TCG CCA CG-3′). Via these primers, restriction sites were introduced immediately upstream of the ribosome binding site of the tatE gene (PstI) and downstream of the stop codon of the tatE gene (XbaI). The amplified PCR fragment was cleaved with PstI and XbaI and ligated into PstI/XbaI-digested pACYC-TatABC, resulting in pACYC-TatABCE. The tatABCE fragment was excised with EcoRI and XbaI, and the sticky ends were filled in with Klenow enzyme and ligated into SmaI-digested pHSG575, resulting in pHSG-TatABCE. Plasmid pHSG-TatAC was constructed via cross-over PCR, using pHSG-TatABCE as a template. First, tatA was amplified by PCR using primers TatA-for (5′-CAG GAT CCA CAG AGG AAC ATG TAT GG-3′) and TatAC-rev (5′-GCG TGA TAA GCG GTT GAG TAT CTT CTA CAG ACA TGG ATT ACA CCT GCT CTT TAT CGT GGC GC-3′) with its 5′ region corresponding to the 5′ end of the tatC gene. In a second PCR, the tatC gene was amplified using primers TatC-rev (5′-GCC CTG CAG GGC GGT TGA ATT TAT TC-3′) and TatAC-for (5′-GCG CCA CGA TAA AGA GCA GGT GTA ATC CAT GTC TGT AGA AGA TAC TCA ACC GCT TAT CAC GC-3′) with the 5′ end of primer TatAC-for corresponding to the 3′ end of the tatA gene. In a final PCR using primers TatA-for and TatC-rev, an equimolar mixture of the PCR products derived from the two PCR reactions described before was used as the template to create an artificial tatAC operon, in which the start codon of tatC is localized at the same position as the start codon of tatB in the tatABC operon of E. coli. The resulting cross-over PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and PstI and ligated into BamHI/PstI-digested pHSG575, resulting in plasmid pHSG-TatAC. The correctness of all plasmid constructions was verified by DNA sequencing. Isolation of Tat Mutants—Plasmid pHSG-TatAC was mutagenized in vivo using 2-aminopurine (causing G-C → A-T and A-T → G-C transitions) (19Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) or 5-azacytidine (causing G-C → T-A and G-C → C-G transversions) (20Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) as mutagenic agents. Approximately 1000–10000 cells of E. coli DH5α (21Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) containing pHSG-TatAC were inoculated in 5 ml of Luria Bertani medium containing 700 μg/ml 2-aminopurine or, alternatively, 5-azacytidine in concentrations of 5, 10, 50, 70, or 100 μg/ml. The cells were incubated at 37 °C on a rotary shaker with 200 rpm for 24 h. Subsequently, plasmid DNA was prepared from the various pools of cells and used to transform the tat deletion mutant GSJ101 (18Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2811-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (see below). In vitro mutagenesis of pHSG-TatAC using hydroxylamine (causing G-C → A-T transitions) as a mutagenic agent was performed as described by Humphreys et al. (22Humphreys G.O. Willshaw G.A. Smith H.R. Anderson E.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 145: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 2 μg of pHSG-TatAC were incubated for 30–90 min at 70 °C in 200 μlof1 m hydroxylamine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm EDTA. Subsequently, the DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 70 mm NaCl (final concentration) and washed several times with 70% ethanol. The mutagenized plasmid pools were independently transformed into the tat deletion mutant GSJ101 by electroporation. The transformed cells were plated on minimal medium agar plates containing 0.4% glycerol and 50 mm TMAO and incubated anaerobically (gas-generating kit; Oxoid) at 37 °C for up to 5 days. Single mutant colonies that appeared on the selection plates were restreaked on the same medium, and 18 isolates that showed reproducible anaerobic growth were chosen for further characterization. From these isolates, plasmid pHSG-TatAC was isolated, and the tatAC gene fragment was transferred into fresh, nonmutagenized pHSG575 vector to eliminate possible mutations that might have occurred in the vector part of pHSG-TatAC. The resulting pHSG-TatAC plasmids were subsequently used for DNA sequence analysis and further functional characterizations. Miscellaneous Procedures—Fractionation of cells into a fraction containing the cytosol and membranes (C/M) and a periplasmic fraction (P) by using an EDTA-lysozyme spheroplasting method has been described previously (18Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2811-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For the preparation of membranes, the cells were grown overnight in 10 ml of Luria Bertani medium. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and subsequently broken by ultrasonification (UP 200 S; Dr. Hielscher GmbH, Teltow, Germany; amplitude, 60%, cycle, 0.6). After removal of residual cell debris by a low speed centrifugation step (15 min at 4 °C at 21,000 × g), the membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation (1 h at 4 °C at 200,000 × g). The membrane pellet was washed once with 1 ml of 1 m potassium acetate and subsequently resuspended in 200 μlof1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Protein concentrations in the samples were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-TatA, anti-TatC, or anti-TalB antibodies were done as described earlier (24Halbig D. Wiegert T. Blaudeck N. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Western blotting using anti-MalE was performed by using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The chemoluminescent protein bands were recorded and quantified using the CCD camera and image analyzing system Fujifilm LAS-1000 (Fuji Photo Film) together with the software AIDA 2.41 (Raytest). An E. coli TatAC Minimal Translocase Possesses Residual Translocation Activity—In a previous study, we have established a Tat-specific reporter system (TorA-MalE) that is based on the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MalE) and allows an easy in situ detection of Tat-dependent protein export on indicative media (18Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2811-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MalE is part of the uptake system for maltose, and its localization in the periplasm is absolutely required for growth of E. coli on minimal medium agar plates containing maltose as the sole carbon source (25Dassa E. Lambert P. Res. Microbiol. 1997; 148: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the red color of E. coli cells on MacConkey agar plates containing maltose (indicative for acid production) is only observed when MalE is exported across the plasma membrane (26Duplay P. Bedouelle H. Fowler A. Zabin I. Saurin W. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10606-10613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TorA-MalE reporter consists of the mature part of the normally Sec-dependent periplasmic maltose-binding protein fused to the signal peptide of the Tat-dependent periplasmic trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA). Export of the TorA-MalE hybrid precursor has been shown to be strictly dependent on the presence of a functional Tat system (18Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2811-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, the gene encoding the TorA-MalE reporter as well as the tat genes under examination were cloned on two different plasmids (Table I) and subsequently cotransformed into the tat deletion mutant GSJ101, a malE-negative derivative of the strain DADE (27Wexler M. Sargent F. Jack R.L. Stanley N.R. Bogsch E.G. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16717-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) in which all the known tat genes are deleted (18Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2811-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GSJ101 containing solely the plasmid pTorA-MalE could not grow on minimal medium containing maltose and showed a pale color on MacConkey plates containing maltose (Table II). The same phenotype was observed with GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE) cotransformed with the pHSG575 empty vector. In contrast, cells of GSJ101 containing plasmids pTorA-MalE and pHSG-TatABCE (a pHSG575 derivative containing the genes tatA, tatB, tatC, and tatE cloned in an operon like fashion under the regulatory control of the lac promoter) efficiently grew on maltose minimal medium and showed a red color on MacConkey plates containing maltose (Table II). These results confirm our previous findings that TorA-MalE is exported in a strictly Tat-dependent fashion (18Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2811-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Table IIPhenotype of bacterial strains on MacConkey maltose, maltose minimal medium, and glycerol/TMAO agar platesBacterial strainGrowth on maltose minimal mediumaBacterial strains were streaked on minimal medium agar plates containing 0.4% maltose as the sole carbon source or on MacConkey agar plates containing 1% maltose and incubated at 37 °C. +++, fast growth; ++, medium growth; +, slow growth; -, no growth.Color of colonies on MacConkey maltoseaBacterial strains were streaked on minimal medium agar plates containing 0.4% maltose as the sole carbon source or on MacConkey agar plates containing 1% maltose and incubated at 37 °C. +++, fast growth; ++, medium growth; +, slow growth; -, no growth.Anaerobic growth on glycerol/TMAObBacterial strains were streaked on glycerol/TMAO agar plates and incubated anaerobically at 37 °C. +, growth; -, no growth.GSJ100-Pale+GSJ101-Pale-GSJ101 (pHSG-TatABCE)-Pale+GSJ101 (pHSG-TatAC)-Pale-GSJ100 (pTorA-MalE)+++Red+GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE)-Pale-GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG575)-Pale-GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatABCE)+++Red+GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatAC)+Light red (pink)-GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatAC-M1)+++Red+GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatAC-M2)++Red+GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatAC-M3)+++Red+GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatAC-M4)+++Red+GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatAC-M5)+++Red+a Bacterial strains were streaked on minimal medium agar plates containing 0.4% maltose as the sole carbon source or on MacConkey agar plates containing 1% maltose and incubated at 37 °C. +++, fast growth; ++, medium growth; +, slow growth; -, no growth.b Bacterial strains were streaked on glycerol/TMAO agar plates and incubated anaerobically at 37 °C. +, growth; -, no growth. Open table in a new tab Next, we analyzed whether the presence of TatB is required for membrane translocation of the TorA-MalE protein. For this purpose, plasmid pHSG575-TatAC was constructed that contains the tatA and tatC genes cloned under the control of the lac promoter. To verify expression of the two genes, plasmids pHSG-TatABCE and pHSG-TatAC were transformed into the tat deletion strain GSJ101, and the membrane fractions of the respective strains were analyzed by Western blotting using TatA- and TatC-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, the amounts of TatA were identical for strain GSJ101 (pHSG-TatAC) (Fig. 1, upper panel, lane 6) and GSJ101 (pHSG-TatABCE) (Fig. 1, upper panel, lane 8). In contrast, the amount of TatC was somewhat increased in GSJ101 (pHSG-TatAC) (Fig. 1, lower panel, lane 6) when compared with GSJ101 (pHSG-TatABCE) (Fig. 1, lower panel, lane 8), which might be due to the fact that the tatC gene in plasmid pHSG-TatAC is positioned closer to the lac promoter than it is in plasmid pHSG-TatABCE or to an altered mRNA stability. Alternatively, because tatB initiates with GTG and thus translational efficiency falls dramatically after tatA translation in the tatABCE construct and because tatC is translationally coupled to tatB, the translation of tatC is also low. In pHSG-TatAC, the ATG start codon of the tatC gene has been retained (and not changed to GTG) and, therefore, translation of tatC is likely to be much higher. Next, pHSG-TatAC was transformed into GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE), and the resulting strain GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatAC) was tested for MalE export on indicative media. As shown in Table II, GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatAC) was able to grow on maltose minimal medium, although at a significantly lower rate when compared with GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatABCE). On MacConkey plates containing maltose, GSJ101 (pTorA-MalE, pHSG-TatAC) formed light red (pink) colonies. From these results we conclude that low levels of TorA-MalE can be exported in the absence of TatB and that the components TatA and TatC are sufficient to form a functional, although inefficient minimal translocase in E. coli. Isolation of Tat Mutants Allowing Export of TorA in the Absence of TatB—TMAO reductase (TorA) is a periplasmic molybdoenzyme that allows E. coli to use TMAO as a respiratory final electron acceptor. TorA is exported in a Tat-dependent manner, and it has been shown that TatB is required for TorA membrane translocation and for anaerobic growth of E. coli on the nonfermentable carbon source glycerol with TMAO as sole respiratory electron acceptor (9Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we found that strain GSJ101 containing pHSG-TatABCE, but not pHSG-TatAC, was able to grow anaerobically on minimal medium containing glycerol and TMAO (Table II). We therefore asked whether mutations in the E. coli TatAC minimal translocase could be isolated that would allow for TorA translocation despite the absence of TatB, thereby converting a barely functional core of a TatABC(E)-type system into an efficient translocase of the TatAC type. To allow a broad spectrum of mutagenesis events, plasmid pHSG-TatAC was subjected either to in vivo mutagenesis using 2-aminopurine (19Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) or 5-azacytidine (20Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After introduction of the differently mutagenized pools of pHSG-TatAC into the tat deletion strain GSJ101 by electroporation, the corresponding transformed cells were plated onto TMAO/glycerol minimal medium and incubated under anaerobic conditions. Depending on the nature and concentration of the mutagen used, the formation of up to 200 single colonies could be observed after 5 days of incubation. After restreaking of the colonies on TMAO/glycerol medium, 18 randomly selected clones from independent mutagenesis approaches that showed reproducible growth under anaerobic conditions were chosen for further characterization.

To get insight into a role of the scavenger receptors in diabetes-enhanced atherosclerotic complications, the effects on class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) of high glucose exposure in vitro as well as the diabetic conditions in vivo were determined in the present study. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that high glucose exposure to human monocyte-derived macrophages led to an increased SR-A expression with a concomitant increase in the endocytic uptake of acetylated LDL and oxidized LDL. The endocytic process was significantly suppressed by an anti-SR-A neutralizing antibody. Stability analyses revealed a significant increased stability of SR-A at a mRNA level but not a protein level, indicating that high glucose-induced up-regulation of SR-A is due largely to increased stability of SR-A mRNA. High glucose-enhanced SR-A expression was prevented by protein kinase C and NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors as well as antioxidants. High glucose-enhanced production of intracellular peroxides was visualized in these cells, which was attenuated by an antioxidant. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that peritoneal macrophages from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice increased SR-A expression when compared with those from nondiabetic mice. Endocytic degradation of acetylated LDL and oxidized LDL were also increased with these macrophages but not with the corresponding macrophages from diabetic SR-A knock-out mice. These in vitro and in vivo results probably suggest that reactive oxygen species generated from a protein kinase C-dependent NAD(P)H oxidase pathway plays a role in the high glucose-induced up-regulation of SR-A, leading to the increased endocytic degradation of modified LDL for foam cell formation. This could be one mechanism for an increased rate of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2036174392,"Tetraspanin CD82 has been implicated in integrin-mediated functions such as cell motility and invasiveness. Although tetraspanins associate with integrins, it is unknown if and how CD82 regulates the functionality of integrins. In this study, we found that Du145 prostate cancer cells underwent morphogenesis on the reconstituted basement membrane Matrigel to form an anastomosing network of multicellular structures. This process entirely depends on integrin α6, a receptor for laminin. After CD82 is expressed in Du145 cells, this cellular morphogenesis was abolished, indicating a functional cross-talk between CD82 and α6 integrins. Interestingly, antibodies against other tetraspanins expressed in Du145 cells such as CD9, CD81, and CD151 did not block this integrin α6-dependent morphogenesis. We further found that CD82 significantly inhibited cell adhesion on laminin 1. Notably, the level of α6 integrins on the cell surface was down-regulated upon CD82 expression, although total cellular α6 protein levels remained unchanged in CD82-expressing cells. This down-regulation indicates that the diminished cell adhesiveness of CD82-expressing Du145 cells on laminin likely resulted from less cell surface expression of α6 integrins. As expected, CD82 physically associated with the integrin α6 in Du145-CD82 transfectant cells, suggesting that the formation of the CD82-integrin α6 complex reduces α6 integrin cell surface expression. Finally, the internalization of cell surface integrin α6 is significantly enhanced upon CD82 expression. In conclusion, our results indicate that 1) CD82 attenuates integrin α6 signaling during a cellular morphogenic process; 2) the decreased surface expression of α6 integrins in CD82-expressing cells is likely responsible for the diminished adhesiveness on laminin and, subsequently, results in the attenuation of α6 integrin-mediated cellular morphogenesis; and 3) the accelerated internalization of integrin α6 upon CD82 expression correlates with the down-regulation of cell surface integrin α6.

Signaling molecules such as Rho GTPases, cAMP-dependent kinase, p130CAS/Crk, and Src kinases are involved in CD82-initiated or -mediated signaling (12Jee B. Jin K. Hahn J.H. Song H.G. Lee H. Exp.

One putative mechanism by which CD82 regulates cellular signal transduction is that CD82 per se directly initiates signaling to attenuate or amplify other cellular signal transductions. The biochemical structure of tetraspanins, however, implies that CD82 is less likely to function as an independent signal initiator. Another putative mechanism is that CD82 regulates the signaling initiated from its associated proteins. For example, recent studies revealed that CD82 attenuates epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling by accelerating EGF receptor endocytosis through a physical interaction with EGF receptor and also by inhibiting the ligand-induced dimerization of the EGF receptor (23Odintsova E. Sugiura T. Berditchevski F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1009-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Odintsova E. Voortman J. Gilbert E. Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4557-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It has been reported that integrin α3β1, α4β1, α5β1, α6β1, or αLβ2 associates with CD82 in cells such as leukemia cells, rhabdomyosarcoma cells, hamster ovary cells, and colon carcinoma cells (9Shibagaki N. Hanada K. Yamaguchi S. Yamashita H. Shimada S. Hamada H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Ono M. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 4081-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, CD82 is also likely to regulate integrin-mediated signaling. Although the CD82-integrin complex is prevalent, and the role of CD82 in integrin-mediated cell migration is well documented, it still remains to be assessed 1) whether or not CD82 directly regulates the functional status of its associated integrins and 2) if CD82 indeed affects integrin activity, what regulatory mechanism exists. To address these questions, we analyzed the effect of CD82 on integrin-dependent cellular morphogenic process on three-dimensional extracellular matrices (ECM). Previously this morphogenesis assay has been used to evaluate the functional cross-talk between tetraspanin CD151 and laminin-binding integrins (29Zhang X.A. Kazarov A.R. Yang X. Bontrager A.L. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this morphogenesis assay, cells attached on the ECM gel migrate and align to form cell-cell contacts and are subsequently organized into multicellular cables that intersect each other (30Kubota Y.

In the process of this pattern formation, the three-dimensional extracellular cues play a critical role (37Vernon R.B. Sage E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 873-883PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ingber D.E. Folkman J. Cell. 1989; 58: 803-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This cellular morphogenesis combines cell-ECM adhesion, cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, differentiation (in the case of endothelial cells), and the branching or intersecting process. Thus, the assay is versatile and can be used to study these biological events. Second, cellular functions such as adhesion and migration are evaluated in a three-dimensional environment, which provides a more physiological setting than the traditional in vitro experiments carried out on two-dimensional matrices. Furthermore, the assay is feasible and is a relatively short termed morphogenesis assay. Finally, formation of cellular cable networks on a three-dimensional substratum appears to be a common morphogenic process for many cells ranging from endothelial cells, fibroblast cells, smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells, to cancer cells (29Zhang X.A.

This assay, therefore, could be widely applied to most cells commonly used for molecular and cellular studies as a morphogenetic readout, although the physiological relevance of this morphogenesis for many cells still remains unclear. By taking these advantages, we have used this cellular morphogenesis assay as an experimental model to assess if and how the effect of CD82 on integrin-mediated adhesion or migration is linked to cellular morphogenesis. The goals of this study were multiple. First, we sought to determine whether CD82 directly regulates the primary function of integrins, i.e. cell-ECM adhesion. If so, second, could we identify the mechanism responsible for the regulatory activity of CD82? Third, we aimed to analyze the functional interplay between CD82 and integrins during cellular morphogenesis. Through this study, we found that CD82 functions as a negative regulator of integrin-dependent cell adhesion and morphogenesis. More importantly, we demonstrated that CD82 down-regulates integrin α6-dependent cell adhesion by accelerating the internalization of cell surface integrin α6. Although the integrin-tetraspanin interactions have been described for more than a decade, our discovery illustrates an important mechanism by which tetraspanins regulate integrin function.

Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Stained cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence intensity obtained with the negative control mAb was subtracted from each individual mAb staining to give a specific mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) unit of each individual staining. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Immuoprecipitations were carried out basically as described previously (47Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25005-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, identical numbers of Du145 transfectant cells were lysed with lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysis buffer contained 1% Brij 98 or 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and 2 mm sodium fluoride. In some experiments, cell surface was labeled with 0.5 mg/ml EZlink sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C for 2 h before cell lysis. The lysates were precleared with a combination of protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) two times at 4 °C after removing the insoluble material by 14,000 × g centrifugation. Then mAb-preabsorbed protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose beads were incubated with cell lysate from 3 h to overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed with the lysis buffer 3 times, dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The nitrocellulose membranes were sequentially immunoblotted with primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and then detected with chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For biotinylation experiments, the membranes were blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated extravidin (Sigma) followed with chemiluminescence. In some cases, the immunoblots were stripped and reblotted with mAbs according to the manufacturer's instruction. For Western blotting of total cellular proteins, an identical number of cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the protein concentrations of samples were normalized, equal amounts of proteins were loaded, and lysates were then separated by SDS-PAGE. The following procedures are the same as described above for immunoblotting. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion assays were performed basically as described previously (48Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Stipp C.S. Kraeft S-K. Bazzoni G. Chen L.B. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, Falcon 96-well plates were coated with mouse laminin 1 at different concentrations at 37 °C for 3 h or at 4 °C overnight. The coated wells were then blocked with 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 35 min at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in serum-free DMEM. For prostate epithelial cells, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 35 min at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in PrEGM media supplemented with 2 mm Mg++. After removing non-adherent cells with three washes, adherent cells were visually quantitated. Background binding was assessed using uncoated wells and subtracted from experimental values. Results were expressed as the adjusted number of cells adhered on the plate/mm2 and reported as mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. In Vitro Cellular Morphogenesis Assay—The spontaneous formation of intersecting cable-like structures by Du145 transfectant cells on Matrigel was used to assess cellular morphogenetic process under different treatments. Matrigel or collagen I was placed into 24-well plates (0.4 ml/well) and allowed to solidify for 2 h at 37°C. Du145-Mock or -CD82 transfectant cells were then seeded into each well onto the gel at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well in 0.6 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS. The cells on Matrigel or collagen gel were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and photographed after an overnight or a 24-h incubation. Images were captured using Scion Image 1.60 (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) software through a video camera (TM-7AS, PULNiX America, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) attached to an inverted phase contrast microscope. All results represented at least three independent and reproducible experiments. Internalization Assay—Ligand-dependent internalization assays were performed according to standard protocols (49Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-schwartz J. Yamada K.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13819-13827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Instead of iodinated ligand, fluorochrome Alexa 488-labeled laminin 1 was used in the experiments. Du145 transfectant cells were detached from cell culture plates using 2 mm EDTA in PBS and washed with PBS and the ligand binding buffer sequentially. Alexa 488-labeled laminin 1 was added to cell suspensions at a concentration of 0.7 μg/ml and incubated on ice for 1 h. The cells were centrifuged at 4 °C to remove the supernatants containing unbound laminin. After resuspending cells with PBS, cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for different periods of time to allow cells to internalize the surface-bound laminin. After the 37 °C incubation, cells were treated with 2 mm EDTA in PBS to remove surface-bound laminin that had not yet been internalized. Then the cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis of the internalized laminin. The cells that were not incubated with Alexa 488-labeled laminin 1 were used as a negative control for the flow cytometry analysis; the cells without EDTA treatment after the ligand incubation were used as a positive control. The fraction of internalized ligand was presented as the percentage of intracellular fluorescent intensity at each time point relative to the total cell-associated fluorescent intensity prior to transfer to 37 °C. The percentage of internalized laminin was calculated with the formula (MFI of a certain time point – MFI of negative control)/(MFI of positive control – MFI of negative control) × 100%. The internalization of integrin α6 was determined following the established protocol (49Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4915-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Du145 transfectants were incubated with reducible sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin at the saturated concentration (0.5 mg/ml) at 4 °C to label the cell surface proteins. The labeling lasted for 2 h to allow maximal biotinylation of the cell surface proteins. The free biotin was removed by 3 washes with PBS. The labeled cells were incubated at 37 °C for various time for the internalization and then treated with a reducing solution containing 20 mm Mes-Na, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.6) at 4 °C to remove cell surface-bound biotin. Mes-Na was quenched by the addition of 20 mm iodoacetamide. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer, and integrin α6 was immunoprecipitated. After SDS-PAGE and electric transferring, the biotinylated integrin α6 was detected by peroxidase-conjugated extravidin and visualized by chemiluminescence. The integrin α6 bands were quantitated by densitometric analysis. The ratio of integrin α6 internalization at each time point was calculated from the internalized integrin at that time point as a percentage of the total surface integrin. RNA Interference—Small interfering RNA duplexes against CD82 cDNA sequence were designed and synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). A nonspecific sequence, which had previously been found to be ineffective for knockdown experiments by Dharmacon, was used as a control. Prostate epithelial cells were transfected with small interfering RNA duplexes using Mirus Trans IT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) and the Prostate Boost Reagent (M"

This finding was corroborated by a study of chick mitochondrial DNA on standard neutral two-dimensional agarose gels, which yielded archetypal initiation arcs in fragments covering the entire genome. There was, however, considerable variation in initiation arc intensity. The majority of initiation events map to regions flanking the major non-coding region, in particular the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) gene. Initiation point mapping of the ND6 gene identified prominent free 5′ ends of DNA, which are candidate start sites for DNA synthesis. Therefore we propose that the initiation zone of G. gallus mitochondrial DNA encompasses most, if not all, of the genome, with preferred initiation sites in regions flanking the major non-coding region. Comparison with mammals suggests a common mechanism of initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication in higher vertebrates.

Comparison with mammals suggests a common mechanism of initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication in higher vertebrates. The study of initiation of θ replication in prokaryotes, viruses, and plasmids led to the discovery of a single discrete origin for each genome, which was essential for replication (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., NY1992: 51-52Google Scholar). The large chromosome size of nuclear DNA necessitates multiple origins of replication (2Huberman J.A. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 32: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar); nevertheless, it was widely assumed that nuclear DNA would initiate replication at a discrete site for a given region of DNA. The identification of autonomously replicating sequence elements seemed to support this idea (3Van Houten J.V. Newlon C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, nuclear DNA replication often initiates at a multiplicity of sites across a broad zone (4Zhou J. Ashouian N. Delepine M. Matsuda F. Chevillard C. Riblet R. Schildkraut C.L. Birshtein B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Little R.D. Platt T.H.

Biol. 2002; 22: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Even the EBV genome, which contains a site that behaves like a classic discrete origin when cut out of the genome and placed in a plasmid, is replicated from numerous origins distributed over a broad zone when it is intact (8Little R.D. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2893-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nor is the initiation zone size-fixed; in flies, the initiation zone size is dependent on developmental stage (9Lunyak V.V. Ezrokhi M. Smith H.S. Gerbi S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8426-8437Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the 16.5-kb circles of mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) initiate replication from multiple sites across a zone of ∼4 kilobases (10Bowmaker M. Yang M.Y. Yasukawa T. Reyes A. Jacobs H.T. Huberman J.A. Holt I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50961-50969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although there is great diversity in the size and organization of mitochondrial genomes of plants, fungi, and animals (11Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), within the animal kingdom they are very similar (12Saccone C. De Giorgi C. Gissi C. Pesole G. Reyes A. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), particularly so among vertebrates (13Boore J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1767-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). One might therefore anticipate a conserved mechanism of replication for vertebrate mtDNA. In the 1970s and 80s, a series of studies of mammalian mtDNA gave rise to a strand-asynchronous model of mtDNA replication (14Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The model proposed that replication of the two strands of the circle arose in each case from a single initiation site. These sites were designated the heavy and light strand origins of replication (OH 1The abbreviations used are: OH, heavy strand origin of replication; OL, light strand origin of replication; NCR, non-coding region; np, nucleotide pairs; AGE, agarose gel electrophoresis; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR; ND6, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 gene. 1The abbreviations used are: OH, heavy strand origin of replication; OL, light strand origin of replication; NCR, non-coding region; np, nucleotide pairs; AGE, agarose gel electrophoresis; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR; ND6, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 gene. and OL). The site of second-strand synthesis, OL, is a sequence element that can theoretically form a hairpin stem-loop and to which abundant free 5′ ends map. Its primary sequence is poorly conserved in mammals, yet the ability to form a stem-loop is conserved (15Hixson J.E. Wong T.W. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2384-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In its simplest or most literal form, this model cannot apply to all vertebrates. Avian mtDNAs lack a convincing stem-loop structure that might act as a dedicated initiation site for second-strand synthesis, begging the question by what mechanism is avian mtDNA replicated? Birds do share with mammals the abundant short displacement or D-loop form of mtDNA (16Kasamatsu H. Robberson D.L. Vinograd J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2252-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 17Nass M.M. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which until recently was widely regarded as supporting the strand-asynchronous model. As in mammals, the 3′ end of the D-loop is close to one end of the major non-coding region (NCR), and the 5′ end of the D-loop defines OH. At 16,775 nucleotide pairs (np), the mitochondrial genome of Gallus gallus is slightly larger than that of most mammals (18Desjardins P. Morais R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 599-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Avian D-loops, which typically span almost 800 nucleotides (np 75–855 in G. gallus), account for much of the length difference. The high degree of similarity in gene content and arrangement between avian and mammalian mtDNA is illustrated in Fig. 1.Fig. 3Replication forks travel in both directions in avian mtDNA, yet most forks travel away from the 3′ end of the D-loop. Both potential Y arcs were detectable in fragments of chick mtDNA from around the genome analyzed on fork-direction gels (A, D, G, and J) interpreted in B, E, H, and K. C, F, I, and L, standard single digestion Brewer-Fangman gels. Generally the most prominent arc was associated with replication forks traveling away from the 3′ end of the D-loop, as denoted by 3′ above the arc; a notable exception was the MboI fragment spanning np 14,866–16,476, where in-gel digestion with HincII gave rise to arcs of roughly equal prominence (J). Restriction enzymes are indicated on each panel, or the adjacent panel. Restriction fragments are depicted as lines beneath the related gel images, the enzymes applied, restriction sites, and fragment lengths are marked, together with the position of the probe (filled black box).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2G. gallus mtDNA replication initiates across a region of several kilobases downstream of the 3′ end of the D-loop. Gradient-purified chick liver mtDNA was digested with a series of restriction enzymes, and the products were separated by two-dimensional AGE. A 7.8-kb AflIII fragment (np 10,540–1,603) revealed by hybridization with probe 1, without (A) and with S1 nuclease treatment (B). C, probe 1 was also used to reveal a 4-kb DraI fragment (np 14,075–988) containing OH (np 855) near one end. Cleavage with BsmBI yielded a fragment (np 10,092–768) with one end close to but not including OH (D). The samples in E and F were digested and hybridized with probes that detected, respectively, a FauI fragment np 8,831–16,351, and an MscI fragment np 8,334–15,947. G, the fragments analyzed in A–F are shown aligned with the relevant section of the G. gallus mitochondrial genome (np 7,000–1,000). The D-loop region is depicted as a broad line whose 5′ end is OH, the intensity of each initiation arc is indicated by a number of “+” symbols to the right of each restriction fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1Organization of the mammalian and avian mitochondrial genomes. The gene content of mammalian (A) and avian (B) mitochondrial genomes is the same. Each encodes 13 polypeptides and the RNA elements necessary for their translation. ND, NADH dehydrogenase; CYTB, cytochrome b; CO, cytochrome c oxidase; rRNA, ribosomal RNA genes. The 22 transfer RNAs are denoted according to the single letter amino acid code. The D-loop region of G. gallus is 5′–3′ np 855–75 (18Desjardins P. Morais R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 599-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The arrangement of tRNAGlu and ND6 genes means that tRNAGlu (E) marks the end of the NCR and the 3′ end of the D-loop in birds, whereas these elements abut the tRNAPro gene in mammalian mtDNA. The only other notable difference in structure is the absence of a putative stem-loop structure (OL) in the 5 tRNA gene cluster (YCNAW) of birds. C, schematic map of chick mtDNA, indicating the restriction sites related to the fragments analyzed by two-dimensional AGE in Figs. 2 and 4.

Duplex replication intermediates were identified that could not be reconciled with the strand-asynchronous model (19Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and the co-existing population of partially single-stranded molecules was subsequently shown to arise from RNase H degradation occurring during isolation of replication intermediates, which contain extensive tracts of RNA-DNA hybrid (20Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Extensive ribonucleotide incorporation has not been reported previously, and it was not known whether this feature was unique to mammalian mtDNA. The contentious nature of recent findings in mammals (21Bogenhagen D.F. Clayton D.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 357-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Holt I.J. Jacobs H.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 355-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), coupled with the dearth of information on mtDNA replication mechanisms in other vertebrates prompted us to investigate replication intermediates derived from purified mitochondria of the avian G. gallus. The results indicate that bidirectional replication occurs at sites dispersed throughout the mitochondrial genome of G. gallus giving rise to replication forks that travel in both directions around the circle of mtDNA. However, initiation of replication is not random, as most initiation events map to a region adjacent to the 3′ end of the D-loop, centered on the NADH dehydrogenase 6 gene. Purification of Chicken Liver Mitochondria—Chicken liver mitochondria were isolated first by a crude differential centrifugation procedure and subsequently on a single step sucrose density gradient. 20–30 chick livers were minced finely with scissors and washed three or more times with 100 ml of homogenization buffer (HB) comprising 225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free). After washing the chopped liver was suspended in 10 ml/g of wet weight of HB buffer and subjected to six strokes of Dounce homogenization with a tight fitting pestle. All operations were performed at 4 °C or on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × gmax for 5 min, and the supernatant recentrifuged at 9,000 × gmax for 10 min. The crude mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 30–50 ml HB and loaded onto a sucrose gradient (1.0/1.5 m) and centrifuged at 40,000 × gmax for 120 min. Mitochondria were removed from the interface, diluted in HB, and pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × gmax for 15 min. Purified mitochondria were resuspended in 75 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated either for 2 h at 50 °C. Nucleic acid was extracted from the protease-treated mitochondrial pellet by successive incubations with phenol and chloroform, ethanol precipitated, washed and dried, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and stored at –20 °C. Mouse mtDNA was isolated by the same method (20Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). DNA Digestions—DNA prepared from mitochondria was digested with one of a number of restriction endonucleases under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Where indicated RNase H (Promega) treatment was 1 unit of enzyme for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.1–1.2 μg of mtDNA. RNase One (Promega) treatment was 5 units of enzyme for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.1–1.2 μg of mtDNA. S1 nuclease (Promega) treatment was 1 unit for 1.5 min at 37 °C. For RNase H digestion samples were incubated in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. RNase One and S1 nuclease treatments employed buffers supplied by the manufacturer (Promega). Two-dimensional Agarose Gel Electrophoresis and Hybridization— Neutral/neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) was performed by the standard method (23Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For fragments of 3–4 kbp, first dimension electrophoresis was 0.7 V/cm for 20 h at room temperature in a 0.4% agarose gel, and second dimension electrophoresis was 6 V/cm for 4 h at 4 °C through a 1% agarose gel, with 300 ng/ml ethidium bromide. In the case of fragments of >5 kb, first dimension electrophoresis was in a 0.35% agarose gel at 1.5 V/cm for 20 h, and second dimension electrophoresis was at 3 V/cm for 18 h in a 0.875% agarose gel. In-gel digestion for fork-direction gels was carried out as follows, after separation of DNA in the first dimension, the gel lane was excised and washed twice with 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature. The gel slice was twice equilibrated with 1× restriction enzyme buffer (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at room temperature. Excess buffer was aspirated, and 100 units of restriction enzyme were added directly to the surface of the gel. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, a further 50 units of enzyme were added, and the incubation was continued overnight. After overnight incubation, the gel slice was washed first with 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature and then with Tris borate EDTA 1× for 15 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the procedure was identical to standard second dimension electrophoresis for two-dimensional AGE. After Southern blotting, specific regions of chick mtDNA were probed for using random-primed amplified fragments of G. gallus mtDNA. 5 μl (50 μCi) of [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was incubated with 50 ng of heat-denatured DNA and DNA-labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min at 37 °C. Probes for G. gallus mtDNA were amplified using the following primer pairs: 5′-TCAGCAACCCCTGCCTGTAATG-3′ and 5′-GGTGGAAGAACCATAACCAAATGC-3′ np 429–826 (probe 1); 5′-AGCAATCCGTTGGTCTTAGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GCGATGAGGAAGGTGAGTAGGTAG-3′ np 13,016–13,430 (probe 2); 5′-CAGGGTTGGTAAATCTTGTGCC-3′ and 5′-CGTTTGTGCTCGTAGTTCTCAGG-3′ np 1,523–1,797 (probe 3); 5′-CCGAGCGATTGAAGCCACTATC-3′ and 5′-CCTAAATGGGAGATGGATGAGAAGG-3′ np 5,390–5,779 (probe 4); and 5′-GCCTAACGCTTCAACACTCAGC-3′ and 5′-AAGGGGGGTAAACTGTCCATCCTG-3′ np 6,613–7,018 (probe 5) (see also Fig. 1C). Amplification was via the polymerase chain reaction. Start and end numbers are based on the published G. gallus mitochondrial genome sequence (18Desjardins P. Morais R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 599-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Immobilized fragments of mouse mtDNA were detected by radiolabeled probes amplified via PCR, using the following pairs of primers: 5′-CAAAGGTTTGGTCCTGGCCT-3′ and 5′-TGTAGCCCATTTCTTCCCA-3′ np 69–790; 5′-CACCTTCGAATTTGCAATTCG-3′ and 5′-CTGTTCATCCTGTTCCTGCT-3′ np 5,215–5,709; 5′-CGCCTAATCAACAACCGTCT-3′ and 5′-TGGTAGCTGTTGGTGGGCTA-3′ np 8,032–8,497; and 5′-AACTGAACGCCTAAACGCAGGGA-3′ and 5′-AACTGGATTTGAAGTTGCTAGGCA-3′ np 13,867–14,518. Primer sequences were based on the original published sequence of mouse mtDNA (24Bibb M.J. Van Etten R.A. Wright C.T. Walberg M.W. Clayton D.A.

Post-hybridization washes were 1× SSC followed by 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, both for 30 min at 65 °C. Filters were exposed to x-ray film and developed after 0.5–10 days. Free 5′ End Mapping by Ligation-mediated (LM) PCR—Approximately 0.5 μg of purified mtDNA was used as template for free 5′ end mapping. The DNA was pretreated with 8 units of λ exonuclease, according to the Replication Initiation Point mapping technique described previously (25Bielinsky A.K. Gerbi S.A. Science. 1998; 279: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), to remove spurious free 5′ ends created by adventitious DNA damage. In addition, covalently bound RNA was degraded by heating samples for 5 min at 95 °C in 0.1 m NaOH (26Abdurashidova G. Deganuto M. Klima R. Riva S. Biamonti G. Giacca M. Falaschi A. Science. 2000; 287: 2023-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and after neutralization with HCl, ligation-mediated PCR was performed essentially as described by Kang et al. (27Kang D.

Briefly, initial primer extension was performed with oligonucleotide H1, 5′-TAGTCCTTGGGGTCTAACCAAGC-3′ (np 16,715–16,737). After ligation to a unidirectional linker, prepared by hybridizing oligonucleotides 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGTATTC-3′ and 5′-GAATACAGATC-3′ (27Kang D. Miyako K. Kai Y. Irie T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15275-15279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), samples were subjected to 20 cycles of PCR, with H2, 5′-CCAAGCGGGGAATAATATGACTTAT-3′ (np 16,697–16,720), in combination with the longest linker primer. Finally, two rounds of primer extension were performed using radiolabeled H3 5′-TTAGCTGTGGCGTCTAATCCTTCG-3′ (np 16,634–16,657) or H4 5′-GGTATGGGCTAGGTTTTGTCTTGG-3′ (np 16,417–16,440). One-step sequencing reactions using 5′ end-labeled primers were used to generate sequencing ladders (28Slatko B. Albright L.M Tabor S. Ju J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons. Inc., New York1999: 7.4A.8-7.4A.9Google Scholar). LM-PCR products and sequencing reactions were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Primers corresponding to G. gallus mtDNA were based on the published sequence (18Desjardins P. Morais R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 599-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Origin Detection and Mapping—In a previous study, we reported that initiation of mtDNA replication encompasses a broad zone downstream of the 3′ end of the D-loop, in mammals (10Bowmaker M. Yang M.Y. Yasukawa T. Reyes A. Jacobs H.T. Huberman J.A. Holt I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50961-50969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, a series of fragments of chick mtDNA was separated by neutral two dimensional AGE and examined for evidence of initiation arcs, with particular emphasis on the region downstream of the 3′ end of the D-loop. Restriction sites for the fragments analyzed in this study are illustrated on a schematic map of the G. gallus mitochondrial genome (Fig. 1C). Analysis of a 7.8-kb AflIII fragment of G. gallus mtDNA, spanning np 10,540–1,603 and including OH, revealed a prominent initiation arc and a weak simple Y arc terminating in a prominent spot above the linear duplex arc (Fig. 2A, and interpreted in supplemental information). The prominent initiation arc suggests the majority of initiation events occur within the fragment, via a θ mechanism. The prominent spot above the linear duplex arc can be explained by arrest in the NCR of one of a pair of replication forks before the other fork exits the fragment at np 10,540 or by unidirectional replication in the vicinity of OH. In the former case, OH acts as the terminus of replication. The initiation arc comprises products of coupled leading and lagging-strand replication based on their mobility on two-dimensional AGE and their resistance to single strand nuclease (Fig. 2B). A shorter DraI fragment (np 14,075–988), again including OH, also gave rise to an initiation arc more prominent than the simple Y arc (Fig. 2C), whereas a 7.4-kb fragment lacking OH yielded a Y arc considerably stronger than the initiation arc (Fig. 2D). Hence, some initiation events must arise at sites other than OH, which excludes the unidirectional replication from a discrete origin (OH) as the sole mechanism of replication for G. gallus mtDNA. Still weaker initiation arcs were associated with FauI (np 8,831–16,351) and MscI (np 8,334–15,947) restriction fragments (Fig. 2, E and F) in which the OH proximal ends are more distant from OH than that of the BsmBI fragment (Fig. 2D). These data can be interpreted in one of two ways. Either G. gallus mtDNA contains a series of unidirectional origins of decreasing strength, extending from OH into the cytochrome b gene, or G. gallus mtDNA contains an initiation zone of bidirectional replication whose center lies close to the 3′ end of the D-loop region. Direction of Fork Movement—If the replication of chick mtDNA initiates bidirectionally across a zone adjacent to the 3′ end of the D-loop, and replication terminates in the NCR, then replication forks will travel in one direction only through fragments outside the initiation zone. To test this proposition, fork-direction gels were produced. These gels require an in-gel restriction enzyme digestion treatment between the first and second electrophoresis steps (23Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 29Brewer B.J. Lockshon D. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Fragments from several regions of the genome, including ones distant from the 3′ end of the D-loop, gave rise to pairs of Y arcs (Fig. 3, A, D, G, and J) indicating that replication forks enter these fragments from both ends. Therefore, replication forks travel in both directions on G. gallus mtDNA. In general, one arc was more prominent than the other, and wherever this was the case it was indicative of a majority of replication forks traveling away from the 3′ end of the D-loop (Fig. 3, A, D, and G) (see supplemental information). The major arc is consistent with bidirectional replication arising from a zone proximal to the D-loop 3′ end and terminating at or near OH, so that most of the genome is replicated by the counterclockwise-moving fork. It is equally consistent with counterclockwise unidirectional replication originating in the NCR. In contrast, the other, fainter arc comprising forks traveling toward the 3′ end of the D-loop (Fig. 3, A, D, and G) fits neither model, rather it necessitates initiation at sites far from the proposed initiation zone. Unidirectional Versus Bidirectional Replication—Unidirectional replication originating in the NCR would contribute forks traveling exclusively in one direction, whereas a bidirectional initiation zone would generate forks traveling in two directions. Fork-direction analysis of a BsoBI-BsaHI fragment spanning np 12,777–15,152 indicated that most forks travel away from the 3′ end of the D-loop (Fig. 3G). In contrast, fork-direction analysis of a smaller fragment with one end closer to the 3′ end of the D-loop (MboI fragment np 14,866–16,476) revealed two simple Y arcs of approximately equal intensity (Fig. 3J). The difference between the MboI-HincII (Fig. 3J) and the BsoBI-BsaHI (Fig. 3G) fragments is decisive. It indicates that in a fragment spanning np 15,405–16,476, replication forks exit the fragment at the OH proximal end as frequently as the OH distal end, whereas in a fragment spanning np 12,777–15,152 most forks exit at the OH distal end. This is entirely consistent with bidirectional initiation at dispersed sites, whereas unidirectional replication from the NCR would yield only one simple Y arc on fork direction gels, and there would be no difference in the results from the BsoBI/BsaHI and MboI/HincII fragments. Mapping of the Initiation Zone Based upon Fork-direction Gel Data—Comparison of the set of fork-direction gels also provided an independent means of mapping the initiation zone of G. gallus mtDNA. Based on the equal intensity of the two Y arcs associated with the MboI-HincII fragment (np 15,405–16,476) (Fig. 3J), replication initiates either side of the center of the fragment (np ∼16,000) at equal frequency. That is, approximately half of all initiation events occur at least 1.8 kilobases downstream of the 3′ end of the D-loop. In contrast, in the BsoBI-BsaHI fragment spanning np 12,777–15,125, the signal from the Y arc corresponding to forks traveling away from the 3′ end of the D-loop was greater than the signal of the Y arc comprising forks traveling toward the 3′ end of the D-loop, (Fig. 3G). Therefore, most initiation events originate upstream of the center of this fragment (np ∼14,000); a conclusion fully compatible with the standard two-dimensional AGE analysis, which predicts an initiation zone adjacent to the NCR. Initiation of Replication Occurs Genome-wide in Chick mtDNA—The detection of an arc comprising forks traveling toward the 3′ end of the D-loop in fragments outside the proposed initiation zone was unexpected (Fig. 3, A, D, and G). These arcs could in theory have arisen by a quite distinct mechanism such as rolling-circle replication, which is believed to operate in yeast mtDNA (30Maleszka R. Skelly P.J. Clark-Walker G.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3923-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Han Z. Stachow C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1994; 103: 162-170PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of fragments of chick mtDNA from around the genome revealed initiation arcs in fragments covering all regions, however (Fig. 4). Hence, θ replication can account for all the replication intermediates of chick liver mtDNA. Initiation arcs were faintest in fragments far from the initiation zone defined above, such as a DraI fragment spanning np 3,448–10,746 and an XhoI fragment spanning np 5,456–12,777 (Fig. 4, A and B)."
https://openalex.org/W2058691992,"The hepatitis E virus (HEV) capsid consists of a single structural protein, a portion of which is engaged in isosahedral contact to form a basal shell, and another portion in dimeric contact to form the homodimers protruding from the shell. Previous studies revealed that homodimers of the truncated HEV capsid proteins, E2 (amino acids 394–606) and p239 (amino acids 368–606), model dominant antigenic determinants of HEV. Immunization with these proteins protected rhesus monkeys against the virus, and three monoclonal antibodies against the homodimers could neutralize HEV infectivity and/or immune-capture of the virus. Furthermore, homodimers of p239 further interact to form particles of 23 nm diameter, rendering it an efficacious candidate vaccine. In light of this we postulate that the interactions involved in the formation of the homodimers and particles might be similar to those involved in assembly of the virus capsid. Presently, mutational analysis was carried out to identify these sites of interactions. The site of dimeric interactions was located to a cluster of six hydrophobic amino acids residues, Ala597, Val598, Ala599, Leu601, and Ala602; furthermore, the site involved in particle formation was located at amino acids 368–394. The possibility that these sites are also involved in assembly of the virus capsid is supported by the fact that they are located at two major and highly conserved hydrophobic regions of the HEV structural protein.

The infection is mainly confined to humans and non-human primates, and there are increasing reports suggesting that the infection might be more widespread and could affect other animals, including pigs and rodents (3Arankalle V.A.

The virus cannot be propagated efficiently in vitro. HEV isolated from patients is a small, non-enveloped, single positive-stranded RNA virus with an isosahedral capsid of average 30-nm diameter (4Bradley D. Andjaparidze A. Cook Jr., E.H.

The viral genome of 7.5 kilobases is organized as three open reading frames; open reading frame 1 maps to the 5′ terminus and encodes a non-structural protein, open reading frame 2 maps to the 3′ terminus and encodes for a major structural protein, and open reading frame 3 overlaps both and encodes a thus far unknown function (5Tam A.W. Smith M.M. Guerra M.E. Huang C.C. Bradley D.W. Fry K.E. Reyes G.R. Virology. 1991; 185: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Morphologically resembling Calicivirus, the HEV capsid consists of a single structural protein that is assembled to form an isosahedral shell with 90 protrusions (6Harrison T.J. Liver. 1999; 19: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Prasad B.V. Matson D.O. Smith A.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is a special feature of these viruses that the single structural protein must provide for all the requirements for it to be self-assembled to form infectious virus particles with attending infectivity and antigenic activity. X-ray structure of recombinant capsid protein of Norwalk virus, a prototype human Calicivirus, reveals two principle domains: shell (S) domain and protrusion (P) domain (8Prasad B.V. Hardy M.E. Dokland T. Bella J. Rossmann M.G. Estes M.K. Science. 1999; 286: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The S domain consists of N-terminal residues folding into eight anti-parallel β barrels that are engaged in isosahedral contact to form the basal layer of the viral capsid. The P domain comprising the remaining C-terminal residues is engaged in dimeric contact to form a protrusion projecting from the virus shell. Mutational analysis has suggested that the P domain might contribute to the size and stability of the capsid (9Bertolotti-Ciarlet A. White L.J. Chen R. Prasad B.V. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4044-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Being the most exposed part of the virus capsid, P domain may be presumed to also accommodate the principle determinants of infectivity and antigenic activity of the virus. Other plant Calicivirus has evolved an additional (R) domain to the N terminus, which might affect the size of the virus capsid (9Bertolotti-Ciarlet A. White L.J. Chen R. Prasad B.V. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4044-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Hogle J.M. Maeda A. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Truncated protein of the HEV capsid protein (aa 112–607) expressed in insect cells could self-assemble to form virus-like particles (VLPs) of 23.7-nm diameter with T (triangulation number) = 1 isosahedral symmetry (11Li T.C.

It is made up of 60 subunits forming 30 dimeric capsomers, which are assembled into an isosahedral shell with 30 protrusions made up of homodimers of a portion of the capsid protein (12Xing L. Kato K. Li T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Hammar L. Cheng R.H. Virology. 1999; 265: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Except for its small size, the morphology of recombinant VLP is closely similar to the native virus particle, and it also possesses dominant antigenic activity of the native virus (11Li T.C. Yamakawa Y. Suzuki K. Tatsumi M. Razak M.A. Uchida T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7207-7213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cryo-electron microscopy and reconstruction of the recombinant HEV particles by Xing et al. (12Xing L. Kato K. Li T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Hammar L. Cheng R.H. Virology. 1999; 265: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) has distinguished functional equivalents of the S domain engaging in isosahedral contact to form the virus shell and P domains engaging in dimer contact to form the protrusions. The N-terminal 111 aa residues of the capsid protein containing a signal sequence followed by an arginine-rich sequence is believed to interact with the RNA genome. It is possible that this region might be involve in determining the size of the virus particles, as do R domains of plant virus (10Hogle J.M. Maeda A. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), since truncation of these residues has resulted in formation of smaller virus-like particles. We have expressed three proteins of HEV capsid protein in Escherichia coli (13Zhang J.Z. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Lau S.H. Che X.Y. Chau T.N. Lai S.T. Im S.W. J. Med.

Under the mildly denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE, the proteins predominantly occur as homodimers which model dominant antigenic determinants of HEV (13Zhang J.Z. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Lau S.H. Che X.Y.

Three monoclonal antibodies raised independently against E2 homodimer could neutralize the infectivity and/or immune-capture of the virus (18Zhang J. Gu Y. Ge S.X. Li S.W. He Z.Q. Huang G.Y. Zhuang H. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Vaccine. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Moreover, the 26-aa extension to the N terminus of E2 imparts the additional capacity to form a particle of 23-nm radius to the resulting protein, p239, markedly enhancing its immunogenicity and making it an efficacious candidate for an HEV vaccine (14Li S.W. Zhang J. Li Y.M. Ou S.H. Huang G.Y. He Z.Q. Ge S.X. Xian Y.L. Pang S.Q. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Vaccine. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). This has led us to postulate that the interactions involved in the formation of homodimers of these recombinant proteins might mimic the dimeric contact, whereas those involved in formation of p239 particles might mimic the isosahedral contact between the capsid proteins in the assembly of the viral capsid. Presently, we conducted mutational analysis of the interactions involved in formation of the homodimers and particles. The results served to locate the respective sites of interactions to regions corresponding to two major hydrophobic domains in HEV major structural protein. Cloning of the E2 and Related Mutant Genes—The genes encoding for E2 and p239 were described previously (13Zhang J.Z. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Lau S.H. Che X.Y. Chau T.N. Lai S.T. Im S.W. J. Med.

Table I shows the primers used for amplifying the genes encoding these two proteins, the related protein E2a, and those used to generate the mutant genes used in this study. The latter encodes mutant proteins, which had been progressively truncated from the C terminus of E2 (proteins 210C-193C); that is, those which have glutamic acid substitution or cysteine substitution of different residues at the C-terminal region of E2 (S596E-A597C), those which have been progressively truncated from the N terminus of E2 (193N–148N), and those which had been progressively truncated from the N terminus of p239 (227N and 236N). The genes were subcloned into a vector pMD 18-T with a TA cloning kit (Takara, Dalian, China). The resulting plasmid was digested with NdeI and EcoRI for 2h at 37 °C. The flanking fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and a gel extraction mini kit (Watson Inc., Shanghai, China) and then ligated to the non-fusion pTO-T7 expression vector (19Luo W.X.

Open table in a new tab Production and Purification of Different E2 Proteins—The plasmids containing the E2 gene or mutant genes were transformed into E. coli ER2566 cells (Invitrogen). An overnight culture of the transformant was grown at 37 °C in LB medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin until it reached an optical density value of 0.8 at 660 nm. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the culture was further incubated for 6 h. Bacterial cells harvested from the culture were lysed by sonication. It was found that all the recombinant proteins form inclusion bodies in host cells. The inclusion bodies were treated with 2% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 30 min and then dissolved in 4 m urea. The proteins were renatured by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.45, at room temperature and further purified by gel filtration HPLC using TSK gel SW3000 25 × 600 mm (TOSOH, Japan). The purified proteins were stored at –80 °C until use. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Analysis of proteins by SDS-PAGE was done according to the method of Laemmli with modifications (20Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels with 12% or 15% acrylamide in the separating gel and 5% in the stacking gel were used. The separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and then reacted with murine monoclonal antibodies (a dilution of 1:2,000) or convalescent human sera (1:200) at room temperature for 1 h. All the secondary antibodies used were conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (DAKO). The membranes were developed using a mixture of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Gel Filtration HPLC—Purified proteins were chromatographed through a TSK Gel SW3000XL 7.8 × 300-mm column (TOSOH, Japan) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.45, connected to a 126NM/168NM HPLC system equipped with 508 autosampler (Beckman Instruments). The column flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min. The molecular mass of the interested protein was determined by calibration of protein standards, including of ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences). Zero-length Cross-linking of Cysteines in Situ—The indicated residue was substituted with cysteine. Cross-linking of cysteine-substituted mutant homodimers via cysteine residues on monomers was achieved by oxidation in the presence of a mixture of GSH and GSSG according to Taylor et al. (21Taylor A.M. Zhu Q. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 661-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disulfide-linked dimer was separated by SDS-PAGE and whole-gel-eluted for analysis. Electron Microscopy—Particles of p239 were examined by negativestain electron microscopy. Samples of the protein were applied to a carbon-coated grid, and after removal of excess fluid, the sample was stained with 2% uranyl acetate and examined in an F30 transmission electron microscope (Phillips, Netherlands) operating at 200 kV. Delineating the Functional Domains of E2, p239, and E2a— Fig. 1 compares the properties of three bacterially expressed proteins of HEV structural protein, E2 (aa 394–606), E2a (aa 459–660), and p239 (aa 368–606). E2 and p239 have been shown to protect rhesus monkeys against HEV infection (14Li S.W. Zhang J. Li Y.M. Ou S.H. Huang G.Y. He Z.Q. Ge S.X. Xian Y.L. Pang S.Q. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Vaccine. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar, 17Im S.W. Zhang J.Z. Zhuang H. Che X.Y. Zhu W.F. Xu G.M. Li K. Xia N.S. Ng M.H. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 3726-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and E2a was derived from E2 by a truncation from the N terminus of E2 and an extension from its C terminus. Gel filtration chromatography showed that E2 and E2a mainly occur as hexamers of about 200 kDa (Fig. 1A), whereas p239 was eluted in the exclusion volume and appeared as 23-nm particles (Fig. 1B). Under the mildly dissociating conditions of SDS-PAGE, all the three proteins predominantly occur as homodimers of about 40-kDa apparent molecular mass, which were dissociated by heating at 100 °C for 3 min into a monomeric form (Fig. 1C). Immunoblotting shows that the homodimers were predominantly recognized by a HEV-reactive convalescent serum and by three monoclonal antibodies, 8C11, 8H3, and 13D8. These antibodies recognized conformational epitopes of the homodimers, and previous studies showed that they could immune capture HEV. Hereinto, 8C11, and 8H3 could neutralize infectivity for rhesus monkeys (18Zhang J. Gu Y. Ge S.X. Li S.W. He Z.Q. Huang G.Y. Zhuang H. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Vaccine. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). This suggests that the same or closely similar conformational epitopes are presented by the virus capsid, probably in the protrusions projecting from the virus capsid, with two at or in close proximity to the HEV neutralization site. Comparison between the three proteins delineated three functional domains (Fig. 1D). The domain located to aa 459–606 is common to all three proteins, and it is probably involved in formation of homodimers of the respective proteins. Another domain is located to aa 368–394 in the N terminus of p239 and, because it is not present in the other proteins, is likely involved in interactions between this protein to form particles. The third domain is one located at aa 394–458 in E2 or p239 or another located at aa 607–660 in the C-terminal region of E2a. Evidently neither of these domains is directly engaged in homodimer formation, but as will be shown later, they seem to facilitate this process and/or determine antigenicity of the respective homodimers. It was noted that the domain believed to involve in homodimer formation encompasses a major hydrophobic region, and the domain involved in particle formation encompasses another major hydrophobic region. We considered it likely in light of this that these regions might constitute the sites of dimeric interactions to form homodimers and the interactions to form particles, respectively. Design of Mutant Proteins—Mutational analysis of the interactions was conducted using five groups of purified mutant proteins (Fig. 2). Three groups of the mutant proteins were used to analyze dimeric interactions involved in formation of homodimers. These included those that had been progressively truncated from C terminus or carried a glutamic or a cysteine substitution in the C-terminal region of E2. Another group of mutant proteins that had been progressively truncated from the N terminus of p239 was used to analyze the interactions involved in particle formation. The remaining group of mutant proteins, which had been progressively truncated from N terminus of E2, was used to investigate the role of the N-terminal domain in facilitating formation of homodimers and its effects on the antigenicity of the homodimers. The mutant proteins were purified and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting using the 8C11 antibody. Purified homodimers of mutant proteins harboring the cysteine substitutions were treated with glutathione according to Taylor et al. (21Taylor A.M. Zhu Q. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 661-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tested for cross-linking. The results are summarized in Fig. 2 and are detailed as follows. Mutational Analysis of Dimeric Interactions—Fig. 3 depicts Western blotting analysis of mutant proteins which had been progressively truncated from the C terminus of E2 (Fig. 3A) or those which carried a glutamic acid substitution in this region (Fig. 3B). The results show that the capacity for dimeric interactions to form 8C11-reactive homodimers is abrogated by truncation of residue Ala602 and beyond (Fig. 3A) and also by glutamic acid substitution of the residues Ala597, Val598, Ala599, Leu601, or Ala602 (Fig. 3B). Glutamic acid substitution of Val600 did not affect formation of the 8C11-reactive homodimer; however, it was noted in SDS-PAGE that the relative amount of monomer was increased possibly because of increased dissociation of the mutant homodimer. It is noted that this cluster of 6 hydrophobic residues is located among a major hydrophobic region of the HEV structural protein, and it was shown that deletion of aa 603–606 (protein 209C) or glutamic acid substitution of Ser596 or Pro603 flanking this region did not affect the formation of 8C11-reactive homodimers. The mutant proteins having a cysteine substitution of residues Ala597, Leu601, or Pro603 were used to determine the proximity of this hydrophobic region as it occurs in either monomeric subunit of the homodimer. This approach is based on the principle that direct cross-linking of cysteine residues via the disulfide bridge could take place if the Cα atoms of two cysteines are within 6.60 Å of one another (22Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment exemplified in Fig. 4, purified mutant protein A597C was resolved as 3 major bands, corresponding to a 26-kDa monomer, a 40-kDa homodimer, and a 46-kDa disulfide-linked dimer (lane 2). Immunoblotting showed that only the non-covalently linked homodimer assumes the correct conformation as to be reactive with 8C11. Each of these components was purified by whole gel elution for use in the cross-linking study. Whereas the purified 46-kDa disulfide-linked dimer (Fig. 4, lane 5) and the 26-kDa monomer (lane 3) were resolved predominantly as single components of the respective sizes, the purified homodimer was partially dissociated in the presence of SDS and resolved as a mixture of homodimer and monomer (lane 4). GSH/GSSG oxidation of the purified homodimer had resulted in cross-linking of the cysteine residues as they exist on the separate monomeric subunits, as evidenced by the appearance in the reaction mixture of an additional 46-kDa band (Fig. 4, lane 7). To confirm the identity of the cross-linked dimer, the reaction mixture was subjected to heating first and then was further treated with dithiothreitol. On SDS-PAGE analysis, the covalently linked dimer, unlike the non-covalently linked homodimer, was resistant to heating (Fig. 4, lane 8), and it was dissociated into a monomer after further treatment with dithiothreitol (Fig. 4, lane 9). These findings suggest that the Cys597 residues are within the 6.60-Å limit in the homodimer for them to be cross-linked (22Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar treatment of the purified monomer did not result in formation of a disulfide-linked dimer (Fig. 4, lane 6). The other cysteine-substituted mutant proteins, L601C and P603C, were similarly tested, and neither could be cross-linked by treatment with glutathione (not shown). Thus, the results obtained with the C-terminal mutant proteins support the contention that the cluster of six hydrophobic aa residues comprising a major hydrophobic region of the HEV structural protein is engaged in dimeric interactions to form homodimers reactive with the neutralizing HEV antibody, 8C11. It was shown that the dimeric interactions were abrogated by truncation of aa residue 602 and beyond or glutamic acid substitution of each of the residues comprising this region, except aa residue 600. The cross-linking of the homodimer carrying a A597C substitution by treatment with glutathione suggests that the regions, as they occur in the respective monomeric subunits, are in close proximity of one another. Mutational Analysis of Interactions to Form Particles—An extension of 26 aa residues to the N terminus of E2 imparted to the resulted protein, p239, the additional capacity to form particles and enhanced its immunogenicity, making it an efficacious candidate HEV vaccine (14Li S.W. Zhang J. Li Y.M. Ou S.H. Huang G.Y. He Z.Q. Ge S.X. Xian Y.L. Pang S.Q. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Vaccine. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). The extension is located at aa 368–394 in a major hydrophobic region of the HEV structural protein, with 11 of the 26 hydrophobic aa contained therein made up of leucine or isoleucine. The corresponding region in the HEV structural protein is predicted to assume a predominantly helical structure using PSIPRED secondary structure prediction methods (23Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that truncation of even 3 aa residues from the N terminus of p239, including Leu370, abrogated the capacity to form particles. In contrast to parental p239, the mutant proteins (236N and 227N) occurred as hexamers in gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 5A). Nevertheless, the extension did not affect the capacity of p239 or the related mutant protein to form homodimers in SDS-PAGE nor the reactivity with 8C11 (Fig. 5B) or the other HEV reactive antibodies (not shown). Mutational Analysis of the N-terminal Domain of E2 and Its Influence on the Conformation of Homodimers—Fig. 6 shows Western blot analysis of E2, E2a, and the mutant proteins, which had been progressively truncated from the N terminus of E2. The mutant protein with a 64-aa deletion from the N terminus of E2 (protein 148N) retained the capacity for dimeric interactions, but the resulting complex lacked the correct conformation for it to be recognized by 8C11 and the other antibodies. The deficit was compensated for, as in E2a, by a 54-aa extension to the C terminus of E2. Both proteins were then capable of dimeric interactions to form homodimers with the correct conformation in order to be reactive with these antibodies. SDS-PAGE shows that all the mutant proteins having from 10 to 64 aa residues deleted from the N terminus of E2 retained the capacity for dimeric interactions, but the resulting complexes do not have the correct conformation to be reactive with 8C11 except for the mutant proteins 193N and 178N. The latter mutant proteins with deletions of 20- and 35-aa residues retain the capacity to interact to form 8C11-reactive complexes, but this capacity was abrogated by further truncations beyond aa 429. These findings support the contention that the N-terminal domain of E2, located at aa 430–596, or the C-terminal domain of E2a, located at aa 607–660, can modulate dimeric interactions to give the resulting homodimers the correct conformation for them to be recognized by 8C11 and the other antibodies. It is noted that this corresponds a hydrophilic region of the HEV structural protein that is predicted to assume a predominantly random coil structure (23Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). Conclusions—As summarized in Fig. 2, comparison between E2, E2a, and p239 has delineated 3 domains, one involved in the formation of homodimers, another in the formation of particles, and the remaining domain facilitating, but not participating directly in the formation of homodimers. The results obtained for the mutant proteins produced by truncation (210C-193C) or glutamic acid substitution (S596E-P603E) of the C-terminal region of E2 have identified a cluster of 6 hydrophobic aa residue as the site of dimeric interaction in the formation of homodimers. Cross-linking by glutathione treatment of the homodimer of the cysteine-substituted mutant protein, A597C, confirmed that the respective residues are in close proximity as they exist in the monomeric subunits of the homodimer. The 26 N-terminal residues of p239 correspond to another major hydrophobic region, with 11 of these residues made up of leucine or isoleucine. The results obtained for the mutant proteins, 227N and 236N, suggest this region as a site for interaction involved in particle formation. It is shown that the domain located at aa 394–458 can facilitate the formation of E2 and p239 homodimers, but it does not directly participate in this process. It is further shown that all the mutant proteins produced by progressive truncation from N terminus of E2 can form homodimers or higher oligomers. This is because the truncation did not affect the dimeric interaction site at the C terminus. However, truncation of more than 25 residues affected the capacity of the resulting dimer or oligomer to assume the correct conformation as to be reactive with the HEV-neutralizing antibody, 8C11. Expression of the truncated HEV capsid protein in insect cells results in self-assembly of HEV virus-like particles with T (triangulation number) = 1 isosahedral symmetry. Except for its smaller size, the recombinant VLP closely resembles the virus particle with respect to its morphology and antigenicity (11Li T.C. Yamakawa Y. Suzuki K. Tatsumi M. Razak M.A. Uchida T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7207-7213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a detailed analysis of cryo-electron microscopic image of the particles, Xing et al. (12Xing L. Kato K. Li T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Hammar L. Cheng R.H. Virology. 1999; 265: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showed that a portion of the truncated protein is engaged in isosahedral contact to form the basal virus shell, and another portion is engaged in dimeric contact to form homodimers protruding from the virus shell. These authors showed that homodimers are formed near the surface of the virus shell, converge on the 3-fold axis of symmetry, and then protrude at the 2-fold symmetry axis for about 45 Å from the virus shell. The protrusions are a special feature of HEV as they are of caliciviruses (7Prasad B.V. Matson D.O. Smith A.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and as the most exposed part of the virus capsid, these structures are expected to accommodate viral neutralization sites and other major antigenic determinants of these viruses. E2 and its related proteins E2a and p239 provide a model to gain insight into these contacts involved in the assembly of the HEV capsid, and the present study to this end was further facilitated by the availability of monoclonal antibodies raised against E2, which are also reactive against HEV. Under the mildly denaturing conditions in the presence of 0.1% SDS, the three proteins occur predominantly as homodimers, but under neutral conditions the homodimers of E2 or E2a further interact to form hexamers, whereas p239, with a 26 aa extension from the N terminus of E2, occurs as particles of 23 nm. The homodimers of the three proteins are strongly recognized by a HEV-reactive human serum and also by the three E2-specific monoclonal antibodies, 8C11, 13D8, and 8H3. Previous studies showed that these antibodies could immune capture HEV, and 8C11 and 8H3 were found to neutralize infectivity of the virus for rhesus monkeys (18Zhang J. Gu Y. Ge S.X. Li S.W. He Z.Q. Huang G.Y. Zhuang H. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Vaccine. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, these results show that the homodimers and HEV share at least three conformational epitopes, making it likely that the contacts between these proteins might be similar as those involved in assembly of the viral particles. Comparison between the three proteins served to delineate 3 distinct functional domains (see Fig. 1D). One, locating to aa 459–606 and common to the three proteins, is most probably involved in dimeric contacts. Another, locating to 26-aa residues in the N terminus of p239, is likely to be involved in particle formation. A third domain identified was located either at aa 394–458, as in the case of E2, or aa 607–660, in the case of E2a. It was evident that neither domain was involved in the dimeric contacts directly; rather, they seem to assume an accessory function by facilitating formation of the respective 8C11-reactive homodimers. We noted that the domain believed to be involved in dimeric contact contains a cluster of 6 hydrophobic residues, and the domain involved in particle formation is another hydrophobic region with 11 of 26 aa residues made up of leucine or isoleucine. In the mutational studies we tested the hypothesis as to whether the above-mentioned major hydrophobic regions might be the respective sites for dimeric interactions and interactions concerned with particle formation. In support of the hypothesis that the hydrophobic region at aa 597–602 is a site for dimeric interactions, we showed among mutants that had been progressively truncated from C terminus of E2, that preservation of Ala602 is essential, and the dimeric contacts are abrogated by truncation beyond this residue. Glutamic acid substitution of all the residues within this region, except aa 600, abrogated the dimeric interactions, whereas glutamic acid substitution of aa 596 or 603 flanking this region had no effect. Moreover, cross-linking of the homodimer of the mutant protein carrying the cysteine substitution of aa 597 observed after treatment with glutathione suggested that, as it exists in the homodimer, the hydrophobic regions are in close proximity to one another (24Klco J.M. Lassere T.B. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35345-35353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that the other conserved hydrophobic region, locating to aa 368–394 at the N terminus of p239, might be the site of the interactions involved in particle formation was supported by the finding that truncation of the first leucine residue (Leu370) was sufficient to abrogate the capacity to form particles. In preliminary studies we found that glutamic acid substitution of Leu372 or Leu375 also abrogated the capacity to form particles. The domain locating to aa 394–458 and its role in modulating the conformation of E2 homodimer was further investigated by using a group of mutant proteins that had been progressively truncated from the N terminus of E2. Because the truncation did not affect the C-terminal region involved in dimeric contact, all the mutant proteins retained the capacity to form homodimer or higher oligomers. It was further shown that the mutant proteins, having a truncation of up to 36 aa residues from the N terminus, also assume the correct conformation as to be recognized by 8C11, but those having more extensive truncations were not reactive with the antibody. These findings suggest that aa 430–458 might be involved in modulating the conformation of the homodimers. In conclusion, comparison of E2 and the related proteins E2a and p239 has identified two domains involved in formation of homodimers and particles, respectively, and another domain that modulates the conformation of the homodimers and determines its antigenicity. Further studies by mutational analysis identified a cluster of six hydrophobic aa residues in one domain as to be a site of dimeric interactions involved in the formation of homodimers. The domain involved in particle formation comprised 26 aa residues, 11 of which were made up of leucine or isoleucine. Previous studies showed that these proteins closely model important features of the HEV capsid, including its major antigenic determinants (13Zhang J.Z. Ng M.H. Xia N.S. Lau S.H. Che X.Y. Chau T.N.

Vaccine. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar, 17Im S.W. Zhang J.Z. Zhuang H. Che X.Y. Zhu W.F. Xu G.M. Li K. Xia N.S. Ng M.H.

It was noted that the cluster of 6 hydrophobic aa residues involved in dimeric interactions between the proteins is located among a major hydrophobic region of the HEV structural protein predicted to assume predominantly a β sheet structure, whereas the 26 aa residues involved in forming the p239 particle are located among another major hydrophobic region predicted to fold into a helical structure. It was also noted that the hydrophobic aa comprising both regions were highly conserved among natural HEV isolates. In light of this it is likely that the same cluster of 6 residues involved in dimeric contact to form the homodimers of the recombinant proteins could be the critical residues engaged in dimeric interactions to form the dimeric protrusions on the virus capsid and the 26 aa residues, the critical residues engaged in isosahedral interactions to form the viral shell. The third domain consists of either aa 430–458, which modulates the conformation of E2 and p239 homodimer, or aa 607–660, which modulates the conformation of E2a homodimer, imparting to the respective dimmers the major antigenic determinants and neutralization sites of HEV capsid. This implies that such accessory domains are also involved in modulating the conformation of the HEV capsid."
https://openalex.org/W1976275386,"Genetic studies implicate Fgf10-Fgfr2 signaling as a critical regulator of bud morphogenesis in the embryo. However, little is known about the transcriptional targets of Fgf10 during this process. Here we identified global changes in gene expression in lung epithelial explants undergoing FGF10-mediated budding in the absence of other growth factors and mesenchyme. Targets were confirmed by their localization at sites where endogenous Fgf10 signaling is active in embryonic lungs and by demonstrating their induction in intact lungs in response to local application of FGF10 protein. We show that the initial stages of budding are characterized by marked up-regulation of genes associated with cell rearrangement and cell migration, inflammatory process, and lipid metabolism but not cell proliferation. We also found that some genes implicated in tumor invasion and metastatic behavior are epithelial targets of Fgf10 in the lung and other developing organs that depend on Fgf10-Fgfr2 signaling to properly form. Our approach identifies Fgf10 targets that are common to multiple biological processes and provides insights into potential mechanisms by which Fgf signaling regulates epithelial cell behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2056911843,"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are involved in gene regulation in many biological processes including the antiviral, growth regulatory, and immune modulatory functions of the interferon system. Several studies have demonstrated that IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 specifically contribute to the innate antiviral response to virus infection. It has been reported that virus-specific phosphorylation leads to IRF-5 nuclear localization and up-regulation of interferon, cytokine, and chemokine gene expression. Two nuclear localization signals have been identified in IRF-5, both of which are sufficient for nuclear translocation and retention in virus-infected cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that a CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway is involved in the regulation of IRF-5 subcellular localization. IRF-5 possesses a functional nuclear export signal (NES) that controls dynamic shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The NES element is dominant in unstimulated cells and results in the predominant cytoplasmic localization of IRF-5. Mutation of two leucine residues in the NES motif to alanine, or three adjacent Ser/Thr residues to the phosphomimetic Asp, results in constitutively nuclear IRF-5 and suggests that phosphorylation of adjacent Ser/Thr residues may contribute to IRF-5 nuclear accumulation in virus-induced cells. IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKKϵ have been shown to phosphorylate and activate IRF-3 and IRF-7, leading to the production of type 1 interferons and the development of a cellular antiviral state. We examined the phosphorylation and activation of IRF-5 by TBK1 and IKKϵ kinases. Although IRF-5 is phosphorylated by IKKϵ and TBK1 in co-transfected cells, the phosphorylation of IRF-5 did not lead to IRF-5 nuclear localization or activation.

The success of the innate host defense to viral and bacterial infections is dependent on the ability of the cell to detect the presence of the invading pathogen. In response to the recognition of components specific to viruses and bacteria, the host cell activates several signal transduction cascades that produce protein messengers in the form of cytokines and chemokines that impede viral/bacterial replication and spread through innate and adaptive immune mechanisms (1Samuel C.E.

Type I interferons secreted by virus-infected cells activate the innate immune machinery, modulate adaptive immune responses, promote apoptosis of infected cells, and induce an antiviral program in uninfected cells (3Taniguchi T.

Once produced, secreted IFN acts in a paracrine fashion to induce gene expression in neighboring cells through engagement of cell surface IFN receptors. Activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway leads to the formation of STAT1/2 heterodimers, which in conjunction with IRF-9 (or interferon-stimulated gene factor 3γ) bind to interferon-stimulated response elements found in hundreds of IFN-induced genes including 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthase, Mx, double-stranded RNA-activated kinase, and major histocompatibility complex class I, resulting in the induction of proteins that impair viral gene expression and replication (1Samuel C.E.

In addition, IFNs have other pleiotropic effects in the host, with important roles in apoptosis, growth inhibition, and development of protective immune responses via increased expression of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins (9Stark G.R.

Mak's group (accession number U51127), and the transcript encoded 504 amino acids (isoform a). Three IRF-5 transcript variants have been reported: IRF-5 transcript variant 2 spliced out 48 nucleotides corresponding to the 5′ portion of exon 6 and contained an additional 30 nucleotides (encoded 498 aa, isoform b, accession number NM_032643); IRF-5 transcript variant 3 and 4 spliced out 48 nucleotides corresponding to the 5′ portion of exon 6 encoding an identical protein of 488 aa (accession numbers AY504946 and AY504947). Mori et al. (37Mori T. Anazawa Y. Iiizumi M. Fukuda S. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2914-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) also identified two transcript variants: transcript b spliced out 48 nucleotides corresponding to the 5′ portion of exon 6, and transcript c spliced out 34 nucleotides corresponding to exon 5. Using cell line overexpression of the 488 aa (encoded by variant 3 or 4) IRF-5, Barnes et al. (34Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 12: 12Google Scholar) demonstrated that IRF-5 was specifically activated by NDV but not by Sendai virus and that IRF-5 induction also up-regulates expression of IFNA genes. Furthermore, overexpression of IRF-5 induced multiple cytokines and chemokines in infected BJAB cells (35Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).IRF-5 can act as both an activator and a repressor of IFN gene expression depending on the IRF-interacting partner: IRF-5 cooperates with IRF-3 in the stimulation of IFNA gene transcription and suppresses IRF-7-mediated IFN gene expression (36Barnes B.J.

As a direct p53 target gene product, IRF-5 also inhibits the growth of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo (37Mori T. Anazawa Y. Iiizumi M. Fukuda S. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H.

IRF-5-mediated growth inhibition is associated with a p53-independent G2-M cell cycle arrest and with the stimulation of multiple cell cycle regulatory and proapoptotic genes including Bak, caspase 8, Bax, and p21 (38Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M.

Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A related family of shuttling transport factors, importins and exportins, recognizes nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-containing or nuclear export sequence (NES)-containing proteins and coordinates trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. CRM1 (exportin 1) has been identified as an export receptor that recognizes NES sequences directly and is responsible for the export of NES-containing proteins (reviewed in Refs. 39Weis K.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4159-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Two NLSs have been identified in the N- and C-terminal regions of IRF-5, and both of these NLS elements are necessary for virus-induced nuclear translocation (35Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 36Barnes B.J. Field A.E. Pitha-Rowe P.M. J. Biol.

In this report, we demonstrate that in addition to the two NLS elements, IRF-5 possesses a functional NES that controls dynamic shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In unstimulated cells, both NLS and NES are active, but the NES element is dominant, resulting in the predominant cytoplasmic localization of IRF-5. Although IRF-5 is phosphorylated by IKKϵ and TBK1 in co-transfected cells, phosphorylation of IRF-5 did not promote cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation, stimulation of IRF-5 transactivation potential, or induction of IFN promoters.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructions and Mutagenesis—Plasmids encoding IKKϵ, TBK1, RANTES/pGL3, IFNB/pGL3, IFNA14/pGL3, and pRLTK were described previously (26Lin R.

Human IRF-5a cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from the Namalwa B-cell line, and human IRF-5b cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from the MC-CAR B-cell line. Both cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo (FLAG-IRF-5a and FLAG-IRF-5b) and pEGFP-C1 (GFP-IRF-5a and GFP-IRF-5b). DNA sequencing was performed for confirmation of mutations. The IRF-5 point mutants including 1) A157/159 (NES), 2) D156/158/160 (3D), 3) A156/158/160 (3A), 4) D437/441/443/446 (4D), and 5) D156/158/160/D437/441/443/446 (7D) were generated by overlap PCR-mediated mutagenesis.

The CRM1 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Grosveld at St. Jude Children's Hospital.Cell Culture, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—Transfections for luciferase assay were carried out in either human embryonic kidney 293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics or BJAB B-cell line grown in RPMI 1640 (Wisent) supplemented with 10%, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Subconfluent 293 cells were transfected with 50 ng of pRLTK reporter (Renilla luciferase for internal control), 100 ng of pGL-3 reporter (firefly luciferase, experimental reporter), and 200 ng of expression plasmids by calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Electroporation was performed at 950 microfarads and 250 V for BJAB cells. Luciferase assays were performed following a transfection of 2.5 μg of the reporter gene, 2.5 μg of the Renilla internal control (pRLTK), and 5 μg of expression plasmids into 10 × 106 BJAB cells. The reporter plasmids were: RANTES pGL-3, IFNB pGL3, and IFNA14 pGL-3 reporter genes; the transfection procedures were described previously (43Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfections, the reporter gene activities were measured by dual-luciferase reporter assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).Subcellular Localization of GFP-IRF-5—To analyze the subcellular localization of IRF-5 proteins, wild type or mutated forms of GFP-IRF-5-expressing plasmids (2 μg) were transiently transfected into subconfluent COS-7 or Hela cells by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). At 24 h after transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml LMB (a gift from Dr. Minoru Yoshida) for 60 min or the indicated times. GFP fluorescence was analyzed in living cells with an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope and photographed at ×400.Western Blot Analysis—For Western blotting, 2.0 μg of pEGFP-C1, GFP-IKKϵ, or GFP-TBK1 with FLAG-IRF-3 or FLAG-IRF-5 was co-transfected into HEK293 cells. At 24 h after transfection, whole cell extracts (20 μg) were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, and 20% methanol for 1 h. The membrane was blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dried milk for 1 h and then probed with monoclonal FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) in 5% milk/phosphate-buffered saline, at a dilution of 1:3000. The incubation was done at 4 °C overnight. After four 10-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline, membranes were reacted with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:2500. The reaction was then visualized with ECL as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions—293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids as indicated. Whole cell extracts (300 μg) were prepared from co-transfected cells and precleared with 5 μl of preimmune rabbit serum and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for1hat4 °C. The extract was incubated with 1 μl of anti-Myc antibody 9E10 and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and then eluted by boiling the beads for 3 min in 1× SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins or 5% input whole cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, and 20% methanol for 1 h. The membrane was blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dried milk for 1 h and then probed with anti-FLAG, anti-GFP, or anti-Myc antibody (1:1000–1:3000). Immunocomplexes were detected by using ECL (15Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell.

Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 36Barnes B.J. Field A.E. Pitha-Rowe P.M. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 12: 12Google Scholar), and only following virus infection does IRF-5 accumulate in the nucleus (34Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 12: 12Google Scholar). To determine whether a CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway is involved in IRF-5 subcellular localization, isoform a and b of IRF-5 were linked to GFP, transfected into COS-7 cells, and examined for LMB-induced changes in subcellular localization (Fig. 1). Fluorescence microscopy analysis of these two GFP fusion proteins revealed that both IRF-5 isoforms localized exclusively to the cytoplasm in untreated cells; upon LMB treatment, both fusion proteins accumulated in the nucleus within 15 min (Fig. 1B). Since LMB is a CRM1-specific inhibitor (41Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 44Kudo N.

As shown in Fig. 2B, mutants 1–450, 1–400, 1–250, and 1–200 were predominantly cytoplasmic in untreated cells, and following LMB treatment, these IRF-5 forms accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 2B), indicating that the putative NES element was localized to the N-terminal 200 aa. The IRF-5 peptide of aa 1–150 (deleted of the C-terminal residues 151–504) was constitutively localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2B). IRF-5 with a deletion of N-terminal residues 1–160 (aa 161–504) was also predominantly nuclear in untreated and LMB-treated cells (Fig. 2B). Western blotting analysis with anti-GFP antibody indicated that all deletion mutants were correctly expressed (data not shown). These results therefore localize a putative NES element to an N-terminal region of IRF-5 between aa 150 and 160; NES activity is LMB-sensitive, and its association with the CRM1-dependent export machinery may determine the cytoplasmic localization of IRF-5 in unstimulated cells.Fig. 1Leptomycin B induced cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of IRF-5.

B, representative green fluorescence images of living cells expressing IRF-5a and IRF-5b fused to GFP. The subcellular localization of the GFP-IRF-5a and GFP-IRF-5b was analyzed in untreated and leptomycin B-treated COS-7 cells at 15, 30, and 60 min as indicated.

https://openalex.org/W2020379551,"Alix/AIP1 is an adaptor protein involved in regulating the function of receptor and cytoskeleton-associated tyrosine kinases. Here, we investigated its interaction with and regulation by Src. Tyr319 of Alix bound the isolated Src homology-2 (SH2) domain and was necessary for interaction with intact Src. A proline-rich region in the C terminus of Alix bound the Src SH3 domain, but this interaction was dependent on the release of the Src SH2 domain from its Src internal ligand either by interaction with Alix Tyr319 or by mutation of Src Tyr527. Src phosphorylated Alix at a C-terminal region rich in tyrosines, an activity that was stimulated by the presence of the Alix binding partner SETA/CIN85. Phosphorylation of Alix by Src caused it to translocate from the membrane and cytoskeleton to the cytoplasm and reduced its interaction with binding partners SETA/CIN85, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Pyk2. As a consequence of this, Src antagonized the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase internalization and cell adhesion by Alix. We propose a model whereby Src antagonizes the effects of Alix by phosphorylation of its C terminus, leading to the disruption of interactions with target proteins.

Alix/AIP1 (referred to here as Alix to avoid confusion with other proteins termed AIP1) is an adaptor protein that has been identified as a binding partner of various proteins and accordingly implicated in diverse cellular processes. Initially, it was isolated as a binding partner of ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene-2) by two groups and named ALG-2-interacting protein X/ALG-2-interacting protein-1 (1Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). ALG-2 is a small calcium-binding protein whose expression is required for apoptosis in lymphocytes in response to a variety of stimuli (3Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and so Alix was initially implicated in the regulation of apoptosis (2Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, Alix was isolated as a binding partner of SETA (SH3 domain encoding, expressed in tumorigenic astrocytes)/CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa)/Ruk (4Chen B. Borinstein S.C.

More recently, Alix has also been shown to be involved in the endosomal sorting processes (6Katoh K. Shibata H. Suzuki H. Nara A. Ishidoh K. Kominami E. Yoshimori T. Maki M. J. Biol.

Calistri A. Craig S. Popova E. Gottlinger H.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The interaction of Alix with SETA/CIN85/Ruk, which is involved in the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases as part of a complex with Cbl ubiquitin ligases and endophilins (10Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) as well as in the negative regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (12Gout I. Middleton G. Adu J. Ninkina N.N. Drobot L.B.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), recently led us to explore Alix function in relationship to kinases. We observed that Alix and SETA are found in focal adhesions of astrocytes and that Alix can bind the tyrosine kinases Pyk2 (phosphotyrosine kinase-2) and focal adhesion kinase in adherent cells. These interactions negatively regulate cell adhesion and focal adhesion kinase activity (13Schmidt M.H.H. Chen B. Randazzo L.M. Bögler O. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Since Alix can also interact with endophilins (14Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Cristina N. Torch S. Missotten M. Sadoul R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29108-29115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we investigated the direct impact of Alix on receptor tyrosine kinases. The results show that Alix binds the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; SH, Src homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; Src-ca, constitutively active Src; Src-ki, kinase-inactive Src; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidine. constitutively and independently of SETA/CIN85 and, despite its ability to recruit endophilins, negatively regulates receptor internalization mediated by the Cbl-SETA/CIN85 complex by reducing phosphorylation levels of Cbl ligases and ubiquitination of its target proteins (15Schmidt M.H.H. Hoeller D. Yu J. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Dikic I. Bögler O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study, the focus is on the regulation of Alix function by the Src kinase. It was shown previously that the Xenopus ortholog of Alix, Xp95, can be phosphorylated by Src and Fyn (16Che S. El-Hodiri H.M. Wu C.F. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Weil M.M. Etkin L.D. Clark R.B. Kuang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5522-5531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), making a good case for a potential interaction of mammalian Alix with these kinases. Furthermore, as the Src family enzymes are associated with receptor tyrosine kinases and focal adhesion kinases, among many other signaling entities (17Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar, 18Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), it is possible that they encounter Alix in situations where it is exerting its function. Here, we show that Alix interacts with both the Src SH2 and SH3 domains and mapped the relevant regions in Alix. Our data support a model in which the interaction with the SH2 domain is required for binding of Src to Alix, which can then be stabilized by binding of the Src SH3 domain to the proline-rich region of Alix. Alix was phosphorylated at Tyr319 in the presence of normal levels of Src, and hyperphosphorylated by elevated levels of Src at its tyrosine-rich C terminus. This hyperphosphorylation resulted in a cellular redistribution of the protein away from the cytoskeleton and membrane. Furthermore, Alix hyperphosphorylation reduced the association of Alix with SETA/CIN85, receptor tyrosine kinases, and Pyk2 and antagonized the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase internalization and cell adhesion by Alix. We propose a model whereby Src modulates Alix functions by phosphorylation of its C terminus, leading to the disruption of interactions with target proteins. Constructs and Antibodies—Transfection experiments were performed using the following gene expression plasmid constructs. Full-length SETA (123cc) and LacZ were cloned into pcDNA6 (Invitrogen) as described previously (4Chen B. Borinstein S.C. Gillis J. Sykes V.W. Bögler O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and Alix mutants were cloned into pcDNA3. Alix mutants were made with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Various Src family kinase constructs were obtained from Drs. Mike Cox, Bruce Mayer, Tony Pawson, Ton Schumacher, Pamela L. Schwartzberg, and Marius Sudol. SETA refers to the rat cDNA and derived constructs, whereas CIN85 designates the human cDNA and derived constructs. CIN85 constructs were as described previously (10Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 19Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Haglund K. Kowanetz M. Husnjak K. Taylor J.D. Soubeyran P.

In all transfection experiments, the total amount of DNA was kept constant for each transfection using green fluorescent protein (GFP)- or LacZ-encoding control plasmid in place of SETA/CIN85-, Alix-, or Src-encoding plasmids where appropriate. For detection of proteins in Western blotting and immunoprecipitations, we used the following antibodies. Rabbit anti-Src (SRC 2) and goat anti-EGFR (1005) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 and anti-phosphoserine antibody (PSR-45) were obtained from Sigma. Anti-V5 monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen. Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate, Inc. Anti-Alix (49) and anti-Pyk2 (11Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin.

Cell Lines and Cell Transfection—Primary rat cortical astrocytes were isolated and used as described (4Chen B. Borinstein S.C. Gillis J. Sykes V.W. Bögler O. J. Biol.

Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, HeLa cells, or mouse embryonic SYF (Src/Yes/Fyn triple knockout) fibroblasts (22Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) were cultured under standard conditions in the same medium. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the EGFR were cultured in F12K medium supplemented as described above. Cells were transfected with plasmids by a modified calcium phosphate procedure. The day prior to transfection, 2 × 106 cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture dishes, transfected the next day, and harvested after 48 h. Alternatively, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Immunoprecipitation and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assays—Cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice for 30 min in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm sodium azide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, a protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 10 μg/ml each E-64 and trypsin inhibitor, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (2 mm each sodium vanadate and sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium molybdate, and 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate)). Following lysis, the cell suspension was sheared 10 times through an 18-gauge 1.5-inch needle and 10 times through an IM 1-inch needle and incubated on ice for another 30 min. The cell solution was then cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. This supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation studies or GST pull-down assays. For immunoprecipitations, appropriate concentrations of primary antibody were added, and the solution was rotated at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Antibody-protein complexes were precipitated overnight with 50 μl of protein A-agarose solution (Roche Applied Science) by rotation at 4 °C. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed seven times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer on ice. For GST pull-down assays, GST-tagged proteins were freshly isolated from Escherichia coli BL21 cells according to standard procedures (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The amount of isolated GST fusion protein was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. In each pull-down experiment, equal amounts of GST-fused protein were added to the cell lysate, which had been precleared by GST coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. The suspension was then rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, and the beads were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Subsequently, the GST-coupled beads were vigorously washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Sediments achieved by immunoprecipitation or GST pull-down were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in 2× NuPAGE® lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 20% β-mercaptoethanol and transferred to ice immediately. The solution was cleared of insoluble particles by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until further analysis by protein electrophoresis. Western Blotting—Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using an XCell SureLock mini-cell (Invitrogen) in combination with precast NuPAGE 4–12% or 10% BisTris gels (1 mm) at 200 V according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Following electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, stained reversibly with Ponceau S in the case of GST-pull down experiments, and photographed and then incubated for at least 1 h in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin and 1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline). Membranes were incubated overnight with the appropriate dilutions of primary antibody in blocking buffer. The next day, membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody solution (1:3000 anti-mouse antibody, 1:5000 anti-rabbit antibody, and 1:15,000 anti-goat antibody; Sigma) in blocking buffer. After additional washing steps, antibody complexes were visualized on film using Immun-Star-AP substrate (Bio-Rad).

In brief, 1 μl of a 20 μm stock solution of an Alix siRNA duplex was transfected into cells, in each well of a 24-well plate using Lipofectamine 2000 to achieve ∼90% knockdown efficiency. Platelet-derived Growth Factor (PDGF) Receptor Down-regulation— HeLa cells were transfected with Alix and GFP or Src or were alternatively treated with Alix siRNA. After 48 h, cells were serum-deprived for 30 min at 4 °C in F12K medium plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES. The cells were then incubated in medium containing 50 ng/ml PDGF at 37 °C for the indicated times and rapidly moved back to wet ice. The cells were acid-washed with PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 3.4) to remove surface-bound PDGF and incubated for 1.5 h with 1 ng/ml 125I-PDGF at 4 °C to quantify the membrane PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Cells were washed five times with medium, and surface-bound 125I-PDGF was quantified after cell lysis using a WIZARD 1470 γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Values were evaluated as percent of PDGFR on the surface of non-stimulated cells. Cell Attachment Assays—Cell attachment assays were performed as described previously (25Bao W. Thullberg M. Zhang H. Onischenko A. Stromblad S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4587-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Bao W. Strömblad S. Biol. Proced. Online. 2002; 4: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293 cells were transfected and harvested after 48 h. Cells (3 × 105) were then seeded on extracellular matrix-coated or uncoated 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min or 1 h, respectively. Extracellular matrix-coated dishes were prepared by coating suspension dishes (Greiner Bio-One) with 10 μg/ml fibronectin or collagen (Upstate, Inc.) or with 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in PBS overnight. Before use, plates were washed with PBS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h, and washed again with PBS. Cell Fractionation—SYF cells were transfected with Alix and GFP or Src and lysed after 48 h in detergent-free hypotonic buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1 mm MgCl2). NaCl (300 mm) and a protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture (5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 10 μg/ml each E-64 and trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mm each sodium vanadate and sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium molybdate, and 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) were added, and lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the S100 soluble fraction containing cytosolic proteins from the P100 pellets. P100 sediments were incubated with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 to extract membrane-embedded proteins. After a second centrifugation step at 100,000 × g, the sediments were incubated with buffer containing additional 1% SDS to extract cytoskeletal proteins. The remaining insoluble material was removed by high speed centrifugation. Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by immunoblotting.

This sequence is conserved between Xp95 and all p95 orthologs in mammals (Alix/AIP1 and Hp95), suggesting a potential evolutionarily conserved function (Supplemental Fig. S1) (28Wu Y. Pan S. Che S.

We were therefore interested in investigating the ability of Src to interact with and phosphorylate Alix and the impact of this on previously reported activities of Alix, including the modulation of cell adhesion (13Schmidt M.H.H. Chen B. Randazzo L.M. Bögler O. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase internalization by Cbl-SETA/CIN85 complexes (15Schmidt M.H.H. Hoeller D. Yu J. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Dikic I. Bögler O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To map the domains involved in the interaction of Src with Alix, confrontation experiments with isolated regions of the Src protein and Alix mutants were performed (see the schematic of the Alix protein sequence in Fig. 1A). In these experiments, bacterially generated GST-Src domain fusion proteins were used to recover Alix proteins from the lysates of transfected HEK293 cells. We first determined whether the isolated Src SH2 domain was able to bind to Alix (Fig. 1B). The GST-Src SH2 domain recovered similar amounts of all Alix proteins tested, with the exception of the Alix-Y319F point mutant, which lacks the canonical tyrosine kinase target sequence (Fig. 1A; see Supplemental Fig. S1 for corresponding sequences). This suggests that the major binding site for the Src SH2 domain is at Tyr319 and not in the tyrosine-rich region of the C terminus, which is deleted in Alix-784Stop.Fig. 1Src SH3 and SH2 domains bind Alix. A, the schematic illustrates the distribution of PXXP motifs, the classical cognates of SH3 domains, and conserved and non-conserved tyrosines. Please note that all tyrosine residues are conserved between the two mammalian proteins and that non-conserved tyrosines are those that are not found in Xp95. The position of Tyr319 and the regions deleted in two mutants used in this study are indicated. For additional details, please see Supplemental Fig. S1. aa, amino acids. B, the GST-Src SH2 domain was confronted with lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with Alix or Alix mutants as indicated, and the recovered proteins were analyzed by anti-Alix Western blotting (WB). In this experiment, all forms of Alix with the exception of the Alix-Y319F mutant were recovered by binding to the Src SH2 domain. Alix lysate is included as a positive control. (The section between lanes 6 and 7 was removed, as it contained pen markings on the marker lane.) Ponceau S staining of the membrane prior to blotting confirmed equal recovery of the GST-Src SH2 domain, and Western blotting of the lysate confirmed similar levels of expression of all Alix proteins. Data are representative of two experiments. C, GST fusion proteins of isolated SH3 domains from Yes and Src and SETA/CIN85 SH3 domains A and B were confronted with lysate from HEK293 cells transfected with Alix. The upper panel shows the Western blot analysis of the recovered material with an antibody against Alix, whereas the lower panel shows Ponceau S staining that reveals the presence of the bacterial GST proteins. The negative control (lane 1) did not recover any Alix protein, the mobility of which is indicated by the positive control of the cell lysate (lane 6). The Src and human CIN85 SH3 domains recovered Alix, whereas the Yes SH3 domain did so less efficiently. Data are representative of three experiments. D, the GST-Src SH3 domain was confronted with the same lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with Alix or Alix mutants as described for B as indicated. The upper panel shows the Alix protein recovered after GST-mediated pull-down and demonstrates that all Alix proteins except Alix-(Δ717–784) (lane 3) were recovered with high efficiency. Alix-containing lysate is also included to provide a positive control for Western blotting (lane 7). The middle panel is a Ponceau S stain confirming the equal presence of the GST-Src SH3 domain in each lane. The lower panel demonstrates that similar amounts of Alix proteins were present in each lysate. Data are representative of two experiments. E, pull-down of Alix-P749A/P752A/P755A and Alix-P833A/P836A with the GST-Src SH3 domain showed that mutation of the prolines in the Src-binding consensus sequence caused a reduction in the recovery of Alix, whereas mutation of proline residues outside of this region showed no effect. Upon densitometry and normalization to levels in lysates, the intensity of the Alix-P749A/P752A/P755A band was <20% of that of the Alix-P833A/P836A band. Alix-(Δ717–784) served as a negative control.

The isolated GST-Src SH3 domain was able to recover Alix protein from lysates of transfected cells with similar efficiency compared with SETA/CIN85 SH3 domains A and B (Fig. 1C), which mediate the binding of SETA/CIN85 to Alix. To determine which region of Alix the Src SH3 domain bound, pull-down assays were performed with the GST-Src SH3 domain and Alix mutant or deletion forms. The Src SH3 domain interacted with comparable efficiency with all Alix proteins, except Alix-(Δ717–784) (Fig. 1, A and D), which has a deletion of the N-terminal half of the proline-rich region of Alix (for details, see Supplemental Fig. S1). This mutant lacks both the endophilin-binding site, which is PPAKPQP-PARPPPP761 (14Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Cristina N. Torch S. Missotten M. Sadoul R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, silencing of the p21Waf1 expression by small interfering RNA overcame the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced by ICI182,780, suggesting that the induction of p21Waf1 expression has a direct role in mediating the ICI182,780-induced G0/G1 arrest. We further demonstrated that the induction of p21Waf1 by ICI182,780 is mediated at transcriptional and gene promoter levels through the proximal Sp1 sites located near the transcription start site. Co-immunoprecipitation, DNA “pull-down,” and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments together showed that in cycling cells, estrogen receptor α and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) are recruited to the proximal Sp1 sites of the promoter to repress p21Waf1 expression. In the presence of ICI182,780, estrogen receptor α and HDACs are dissociated from Sp1, resulting in increased histone acetylation and de-repression of the p21Waf1 promoter and induction of p21Waf1 expression. The fact that p21Waf1 expression is normally repressed by HDAC activity in cycling cells is further demonstrated by the finding that p21Waf1 transcription can be induced by the silencing of HDACs with small interfering RNA or treatment with HDAC inhibitors.

Estradiol (E2) 1The abbreviations used are: E2, estradiol; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; SERM, selective estrogen receptor modulator; pRB, retinoblastoma protein; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: E2, estradiol; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; SERM, selective estrogen receptor modulator; pRB, retinoblastoma protein; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. is the principle steroid mitogen for normal breast epithelial cells and has been shown to be important for the development and progression of de novo breast cancers. E2 exerts its effect on target cells predominantly through binding to and activating the estrogen receptor α (ERα), which is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. The ligand-bound receptor binds to promoter regions of estrogen-regulated genes, where it recruits co-activators or co-repressors as well as the transcriptional machinery necessary to modulate gene expression. The recruitment of ligand-bound ER to the promoter regions of target genes can occur directly through binding to specific DNA sequences in target genes known as estrogen response elements (EREs) or indirectly through interaction with other DNA-binding transcription factors, such as AP1 and Sp1 (1Brosens J.J. Tullet J. Varshochi R. Lam E.W. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Obstet. Gynaecol. 2004; 18: 265-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to estradiol, the transcription activity of ER can also be modulated by a group of ligands called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which have agonist and/or antagonist functions depending on the target promoters and tissues. Some of these SERMs, including tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI182,780 (also clinically termed faslodex or fulvestrant), have been employed to antagonize estrogen actions in order to treat breast cancer and protect high risk individuals against breast cancer (2Gradishar W.J. O'Regan R.M. Int. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 8: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, also behave as agonists in certain tissues. In fact, the modes of action of SERMs are often promoter context- and cell type-specific. For example, whereas tamoxifen is an effective adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, it can also promote endometrial cancer. Recent gene array data showed that anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI182,780, function by either partially or completely antagonizing the actions of estrogen on most genes in breast cancer cells (3Frasor J. Stossi F. Danes J.M. Komm B. Lyttle C.R. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Although it was initially believed that anti-estrogens function merely by competing with endogenous estrogens for receptor binding, previous studies using mutated ERs and recent x-ray-based structural studies demonstrated that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI182,780 can each induce distinct conformational changes to ER, implying that the ligand-bound ER can recruit specific co-regulators to different gene promoters, thereby selectively regulating target gene expression (4McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 960-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 949: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ICI182,780 is a “pure” steroidal anti-estrogen, and its mode of action appears to be different from that of tamoxifen (6Horwitz K.B. McGuire W.L. Recent Res. Cancer Res. 1980; 71: 45-58PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike tamoxifen and raloxifene, ICI182,780 does not display partial agonist activity. Consistent with this, breast cancer patients who have become tamoxifen-resistant are often responsive to ICI182,780 (7Cummings F.J. Clin. Ther. 2002; 24: C3-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Howell A. DeFriend D.J. Robertson J.F. Blamey R.W. Anderson L. Anderson E. Sutcliffe F.A. Walton P. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the anti-estrogens not only inhibit estradiol-dependent growth through blocking estrogen actions through ER but also have a direct growth-inhibitory effect on ER-positive cells (9Jensen E.V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 784: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, transition through the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle is regulated by cyclin D (cyclin D1, D2, and D3)-, cyclin E-, and cyclin A-dependent kinases, respectively (10Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). The D-type cyclins bind and activate CDK4 and CDK6 preferentially, whereas cyclins E and A interact predominantly with CDK2 (10Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). One of the major substrates of these CDKs is the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) family of pocket proteins (pRB, p107, and p130) (11E Lam W.-F La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Mulligan G. Jacks T. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). During the G1 to S transition, phosphorylation of pRB is initiated by cyclin D-dependent kinases and is completed by cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2. Hyperphosphorylation of the pocket proteins causes derepression/activation of genes predominantly required for G1/S progression and DNA synthesis. Two families of cyclin kinase inhibitors function in order to prevent unscheduled proliferation by inhibiting the kinase activity of these complexes. The Cip/Kip family includes p21Waf1(Cip1), p27Kip1, and p57Kip2, and the INK4 family consists of p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d. The Cip/Kip family functions by binding to cyclin-CDK complexes to sterically inactivate kinase activity, whereas the INK4 family bind to CDK4 and -6 to prevent association with cyclin D family members (10Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar, 13Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that estrogens and anti-estrogens modulate cell cycle progression of ER-positive breast epithelial cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but the exact molecular mechanism by which the estrogen signaling pathway modulates the cell cycle machinery has not be elucidated. Although a great deal of effort has been channeled toward understanding the mechanism of action of tamoxifen, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of ICI182,780 action and, in particular, how it regulates the cell cycle machinery. With respect to breast cancer, aberrations in the normal cell cycle machinery are commonplace, such as the increased expression of growth-promoting cyclin D1 and cyclin A as well as the reduced expression of the growth-inhibitory p27Kip1. Consequently, improving our understanding of the mode of action of ICI182,780 will not only be useful for breast cancer treatment but can also lead to better knowledge of ER and nuclear receptor function in other estrogen-dependent tissues such as bone and ovary.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C.

Briefly, calcium phosphate precipitates containing 0.5 μg of wild-type or mutated p21 promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (human or mouse) together with 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase transfection control (pRL-TK; Promega, Southampton, UK) were incubated overnight with subconfluent cell cultures in each well of a 6-well plate. The cells were then washed twice in PBS, treated with ICI182,780 or trichostatin A (TSA) for 16 h in the presence of growth medium, and harvested for firefly/Renilla luciferase assays using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Southampton, UK).Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed on whole cell extracts prepared by lysing cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 30 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitors (“Complete” protease inhibitor mixture, as instructed by the manufacturer, Roche Applied Science) on ice for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay. 25 μg of protein was size-fractionated using SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) and recognized by specific antibodies.

The β-tubulin (556321) antibody was acquired from BD Pharmingen (Cowley, UK), the cyclin D1 (DCS-6) antibody is from Novacastra Labs Ltd. (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK), and the p21 (C24420) antibody is from Transduction Laboratories (Cowley, UK). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat conjugates as appropriate (DAKO UK Ltd., Ely, UK) and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).

The siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Silencing of p21Waf1 was executed using a pool of three siRNA sequences targeting distinct parts of the 119-base coding region: 5′-GCGATGGAACTTCGACTTTdTdT-3′,5′-TGGACTTCGACTTTGTCAdTdT-3′, and 5′-AGACCATGTGGACCTGTCAdTdT-3′.Gene silencing of HDAC1 and -3 were performed using the “smart pool” siRNA oligonucleotides obtained from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO).MCF-7 cells were cultured in 6-well plates until 60% confluent. Cells in 2 ml of culture medium were transfected with synthetic 21-nucleotide RNA duplexes (control scrambled siRNA or p21-specific siRNA) using Oligofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, the cells were either untreated or treated with 100 nm ICI182,780 or ethanol vehicle. After 16 h of treatment, both the suspension and the adherent cells were collected for either Western blot analysis or propidium iodide staining.Cell Cycle Phase Analysis by Propidium Iodide Staining—Cells were collected and fixed in 90% ethanol in PBS and stored at 4 °C until cell cycle analysis was carried out. Cells were spun down, washed in PBS and resuspended in a solution of PBS, containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma, Poole, UK), 5 μg/ml of RNase A (Sigma, Poole, UK) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis is performed using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Cowley, UK). FACS analysis was performed using the Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, Cowley, UK).Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were grown to 50% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for at least 1 day. Following treatment (described in results) for 16 h, cells were trypsinized and lysed in high salt lysis buffer (1% Triton 100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture in 25 ml (Roche Applied Science, Hemel Hempstead, UK). One-tenth of the volume was used as loading control. Samples were diluted in 2 volumes of low salt lysis buffer (same as high salt lysis buffer, omitting NaCl). One volume of a 50% slurry of protein G beads (Sigma) in PBS was added to the samples, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min for preclearance of the lysate. The precleared lysate was incubated with the antibodies against ERα (F-10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Sp1 (PEP 2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or HDAC-1 (H-51; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CDK2 (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at the concentrations recommended by the supplier for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with 1 volume of protein G beads (50% slurry in PBS) for 15 min. Beads were washed five times with PBS-containing protease inhibitor mixture and boiled in loading buffer prior to loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells were grown to 50% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for at least 1 day. Following the addition of ICI182,780 or TSA for 16 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and cross-linked with 1% (w/v) formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and were subjected to the ChIP procedure as described previously (21Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.4), 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and following washes, they were sonicated four times for 15 s in 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete protease inhibitor mixture; as instructed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science)) at the maximum setting (Sanyo Soniprep MSE, Model 150) followed by centrifugation for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and diluted in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) followed by immunoclearing with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 20 μl of preimmune serum (DAKO), and protein A-Sepharose (45 μl of 50% slurry in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies. The antibodies used for ERα were the same as the one used for IP. Antibodies for acetylated H3 (catalog no. 06-599) and H4 (catalog no. 06-866) were purchased from Upstate (Milton Keynes, UK). The protein-DNA complexes were extracted in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 and heated at 65 °C for at least 8 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified using the QIAquick Spin Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). For PCR, one-twenty-fifth of the extracted DNA was used and amplified in 21–25 PCR cycles using specific primers (p21-262) 5′-CAGCGCACCAACGCAGGCG-3′ and (p21+31) CAGCTCCGGCTCCACAAGGA-3′ and control primers (p21-1205) CTTTATTTATGTCATCTCCATAAACCATCT-3′ and (p21-976) GAATACTCCCCACATAGCCCG-3′.Oligonucleotide “Pull-down” Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells after various treatments using high salt buffer as described. After diluting with 2 volumes of low salt lysis buffer, 50 μgof the cell extracts were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with either 0.5 nmol of the 5′-biotinylated double-stranded wild-type (5′-GAGCGCGGGTCCCGCCTCCTTGAGGCGGGGCCCGGGCGGGGCGGTTGTATAT-3′) or mutant (5′-GAGCATAGGTCCATACTCCTTGAGGATAGGCCCGGATAGGATAGTTGTATAT-3′) oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) previously coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma, Poole, UK). The wild-type oligonucleotide corresponded to the region of –92 to –42 of the human p21Waf1 promoter. The biotinylated oligonucleotide-coupled streptavidin beads were washed at least six times with low salt buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and denatured in SDS-sample buffer before running on a SDS-acrylamide gel. The separated proteins were then Western blotted for Sp1, HDAC1, and ERα using specific antibodies. For competition experiments, the extracts were incubated with the oligonucleotide-coupled beads in the absence or presence of 1×,10×, or 50× molar excess of either a nonbiotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a high affinity consensus Sp1 binding site (5′-CGATCGGGCGGGGCGA-3′) (22Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) or a mutant oligonucleotide with the Sp1 mutated (5′-CGATCGGTTTTGGCGA-3′).RESULTSInduction of p21Waf1 Expression in Response to ICI182,780 in MCF-7 but Not MDA-MB-231 Cells—The ERα-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 has been shown to depend on estrogens for proliferation. To study the molecular mechanism by which the “pure” anti-estrogen ICI182,780 modulates cell cycle arrest, proliferating MCF-7 as well as the control ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cell lines were treated with ICI182,780 for 24 h. ICI182,780 treatment caused the ERα-positive breast cancer cell MCF-7 to accumulate predominantly in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle but had little effect on the ERα-negative MBA-MD-231 cell line (data not shown; also see Fig. 2).In order to delineate the mechanism whereby ICI182,780 treatment mediates G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, we examined the effect of ICI182,780 on the temporal expression of cell cycle regulatory molecules by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). The data shown in Fig. 1A demonstrated that ICI182,780 treatment resulted in an increase in the expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitor, p21Waf1, whereas the related p27Kip1 was unaffected. Expression of both p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 was at low levels in the MBA-MD-231 cell line. There was little or no change in expression levels of cyclin D1 and the cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK2, -4, and -6 in MCF-7 cells, although a slight down-regulation of cyclin E and A expression was detected in response to ICI182,780. Notably, cyclin A and E as well as CDK4 and -6 were expressed at higher levels in MBA-MD-231; nevertheless, the expression levels of the cyclins (D1, E, and A) and CDKs (CDK4, -6, and -2) remained largely unchanged in MBA-MD-231 following ICI182,780 treatment.Fig. 1Expression of p21Waf1 and other cell cycle regulators following ICI182,780 treatment in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. A, cycling MCF-7 and MDA-231 were treated with 100 nm ICI182,780 for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared at the times indicated after ICI182,780 treatment, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. The expression of p21Waf1; p27Kip1; cyclin D1, E, and A; CDK2, -4, and -6; pRB; p53; and ERα was analyzed by Western blotting. CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities were determined with specific phospho-pRB antibodies. Tubulin was used as a loading control. B, cycling MCF-7 cells were treated with 100 nm ICI182,780 for 0, 4, and 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibody against CDK2. The precipitated complexes were examined for cyclin A and E, p21Waf1, p27Kip1, and CDK2 expression. C, total RNA was extracted from MCF-7 cells following ICI182,780 (100 nm) treatment for the times indicated and analyzed for expression of p21Waf1 mRNA by Northern blotting. Also shown is the expression of actin mRNA as control for RNA loading. D, cycling MCF-7 cells were transfected with a wild-type human p21Waf1 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3 (–2325/+8) and were treated with ICI182,780 (100 nm) 16 h after transfection. The transfected cells were harvested at the times indicated after ICI182,780 and assayed for luciferase activity. Values are normalized with the cotransfected Renilla activity. All data shown represent the average of three independent experiments, and the error bars show the S.D.

The error bars show S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since one of the principal cellular targets of the cyclin-CDK complexes in cell cycle regulation is the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins, we performed Western blotting using antibodies specific for phosphorylated consensus sequences for either CDK2 or CDK4/6 to assess the in vivo CDK4/6- and CDK2-associated kinase activity in these cells. The data shown in Fig. 1A demonstrates that the endogenous CDK2 activity was down-regulated as early as 4 h after ICI182,780 treatment, whereas the CDK4/6 activity only declined at a much later time probably as a result of the initial cell cycle arrest. These results suggested that the G1 cell cycle arrest induced by ICI182,780 treatment in the MCF-7 cells is primarily the result of a decline in CDK2 activity. The expression pattern of p21Waf1 demonstrated a good inverse correlation with CDK2-associated kinase activity, whereas the overall expression level of CDK2 protein remained unchanged. The initial increase in p21Waf1 expression occurred as early as 4 h, coinciding with the drop in CDK2-associated kinase activity. Since the down-regulation of cyclin E and A occurred at later time points than the up-regulation of p21Waf1 and the decrease in CDK2 activity, p21Waf1 may well be responsible for inhibiting the phosphorylation of pRB and related proteins by direct inhibition of CDK2 activity in the ER-positive MCF-7 cells following ICI182,780 treatment. Nevertheless, the involvement of other mechanisms could not be excluded. Although p21Waf1 has previously been shown to be a gene target of p53, there was no evidence that p53 mediates the induction of p21Waf1 expression by ICI182,780, since no change in p53 expression was observed in response to ICI182,780. Interestingly, the accumulation of p21Waf1 was associated with a down-regulation of ERα expression in the ER-positive MCF-7 cells.To provide further evidence that the ICI182,780-induced accumulation of p21Waf1 is responsible for the down-regulation of CDK2 activity, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to examine the amount of p21Waf1, p27Kip1, cyclin E, and cyclin A binding to CDK2. The results showed that whereas there was little change in the level of p27Kip1 associated with CDK2, the amount of p21Waf1 interacting with CDK2 increased substantially at 4 h and even further at 24 h following ICI182,780 treatment. The CDK2 level remained largely unchanged, whereas the cyclin E and A associated with CDK2 decreased only at 24 h. The initial down-regulation of CDK2-associated kinase activity was first observable at 4 h, and at this time point, there was no change in CDK2 level or the amount of cyclin E, cyclin A, and p27Kip1 binding to it. It therefore appeared that the down-regulation of CDK2 activity in response to ICI182,780 treatment was a result of its increased association with the CDK inhibitor p21Waf1. Whereas these results demonstrated an increase in p21Waf1 expression at the protein level, we performed Northern blot analysis in order to examine whether the increase in p21Waf1 protein was a direct result of an increase in p21Waf1 mRNA. The data in Fig. 1C clearly show that the ICI182,780 also up-regulated the p21Waf1 mRNA level in the MCF-7 cells. In addition, transient transfection of a reporter construct containing 2325 bp of t"

The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are important regulators of this process; they function by binding to cell surface receptors and signaling by means of Smad proteins. Core binding factor α-1 (Cbfa1), a member of the runt family of transcription factors, is an essential transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, and this process is positively or negatively regulated by a variety of coactivators and corepressors. We report that p204, an interferon-inducible protein that was previously shown to inhibit cell proliferation and promote the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, is a novel regulator in the course of osteogenesis. p204 is expressed in embryonic osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate as well as in the calvaria osteoblasts of neonatal mice. Its level is increased in the course of the BMP-2-triggered osteoblast differentiation of pluripotent C2C12 cells. This increase is probably due to the activation of the gene encoding 204 (Ifi204) by Smad transcription factor, including Smad1, -4, and -5. Overexpression of p204 enhances the BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation in vitro, as revealed by elevated alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production. p204 acts as a cofactor of Cbfa1: 1) high levels of p204 augment, whereas the lowering of p204 level decreases, the Cbfa1-dependent transcription, and 2) p204 associates with Cbfa1 both in vitro and in vivo. Two nonoverlapping segments in p204 bind to Cbfa1, and the N-terminal 88-amino acid segment of Cbfa1 is required for binding to p204. p204, which is the first interferon-inducible protein found to associate with Cbfa1, functions as a novel regulator of osteoblast differentiation.

Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In adult bone this process is termed bone remodeling and is accomplished by precise coordination of two cell types, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. Its deregulation leads to metabolic bone disease, including osteoporosis and osteopetrosis (2Marks Jr., S.C. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).

BMPs signal through heteromeric complexes of transmembrane types I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors that propagate signals to the Smad pathway. Smad proteins mediate BMP-induced signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. Three classes of Smads have been defined: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common-mediator Smads (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), each of which has a distinct function. R-Smads (Smad1, -5, and -8) are phosphorylated by the type I BMP receptor in response to BMP signals. Once phosphorylated, R-Smads bind to a Co-Smad (Smad4) and enter the nucleus. After translocation into the nucleus, heteromeric Smad complexes regulate transcription of target genes by binding to their consensus DNA sequences, interacting with other transcription factors, and recruiting transcription coactivators or corepressors (5Attisano L.

Furthermore, Cbfa1 maintains osteoblastic function by regulating the expression of several bone-specific genes, such as osteopontin and osteocalcin, and by controlling bone extracellular matrix deposition (7Ducy P.

Biochem. 1982; 51: 251-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Interferons inhibit the differentiation of osteoclasts by interfering with the RANKL-induced expression (RANKL: receptor-activated NF-κB ligand) of c-Fos, an essential transcription factor for the formation of osteoclasts (20Takayanagi H.

Derynck R. Nature. 2002; 416: 686-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The roles of interferons in the control of osteoblast differentiation, however, remain unclear.The activities of interferon are realized by numerous interferon-inducible proteins. p204 is a member of the interferon-inducible p200 family of proteins that are encoded by genes in the gene 200 cluster (22Choubey D. Snoddy J. Chaturvedi V. Toniato E. Opdenakker G. Thakur A. Samanta H. Engel D.A. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17182-17189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Choubey D. Lengyel P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). p204 consists of 640 amino acid residues. In the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–216), there is a basic amino acid-rich nuclear localization signal and a canonical nuclear export signal required for the translocation of p204 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during myoblast differentiation (24Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of p204 consists of two homologous, partially conserved 200-amino acid segments (a and b) in which pRb binding motifs are located. Overexpression of p204 is growth inhibitory, probably due in part to its inhibition of rRNA transcription by binding of p204 to the ribosomal DNA-specific upstream binding factor transcription factor and inhibiting its sequence-specific binding to DNA (25Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Moss T. Stefanovsky V.Y. Cell. 2002; 109: 545-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The anti-proliferative activity of p204 has been attributed to the binding of p204 to pRb via its pRb-binding LXCXE motifs (25Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P.

Here we report that p204 is a novel regulator of osteoblast differentiation and discuss the molecular mechanism underlying the modulation of osteogenesis by p204.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Primary Murine Calvaria Osteoblasts—Calvaria cells were obtained from mice 1–2 days after birth by sequential collagenase digestion. Calvariae were removed under aseptic conditions and incubated with continuous agitation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing trypsin (0.5 mg/ml) and EDTA (1.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min followed by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml collagenase for 20 min. The collagenase digests were then discarded and replaced with fresh collagenase solution; cells released between 20 and 40 min were collected by a sedimentation step and centrifuged twice at 400 × g for 10 min, and the cells in the pellet fraction were cultured in proliferation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine) at a cell density of 2.5 × 104/cm2 in Petri dishes (100-mm diameter). Total protein was extracted from confluent cells using our described previously protocol (24Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Immunohistochemistry—Sections of postcoital day 19 mouse embryos were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and placed in Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl). Protein block (Serum-Free Protein Block, DAKO, Carpentaria, CA) was applied for 10 min at room temperature prior to incubation of the primary antibody. Affinity-purified rabbit antimouse p204 (24Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell.

For detection, anti-rabbit link and streptavidin label from the Super Sensitive Alkaline Phosphatase (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) was used. Vector Red Alkaline phosphatase substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for visualization, and sections were then counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin. The primary antibody was substituted with Negative Control Serum for Super Sensitive Antibodies (BioGenex) from rabbit for negative control sections.Immunoblotting Analysis—To examine the expression of p204 protein, total cell extracts prepared from primary osteoblasts, p204-inducible stable lines, or BMP-2-treated C2C12 cells, and as a control IVT-p204 (i.e. p204 translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI)) were mixed with 5× sample buffer (312.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% SDS, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol). Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris buffer saline Tween-20 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20), blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-p204 antisera (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h. After washing, the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin; 1:2000 dilution) was added, and bound antibody was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).Reporter Gene Assay—To test whether Smads can activate p204-specific reporter genes, C2C12 cells grown to ∼50% confluence in 35-mm culture dishes were transfected with 1 μg of reporter construct (either 204–2SBE-luc or 204–5SBE-luc) along with 1 μg of pSVGal plasmid (internal control) and mammalian expression plasmids expressing Smad1, Smad5, and Smad4 (amounts indicated in Fig. 4). To examine whether p204 affects Cbfa1-dependent transcriptional activities, C2C12 cells were transfected with 1 μg of Cbfa1-specific reporter construct (either p6OSE2-luc bearing six OSE2 elements or p-147-luc in which a 160-bp segment (–147 to +13) from osteocalcin promoter was inserted into the upstream of luciferase), 1 μg of pSVGal plasmid, and 1 μg of mammalian expression plasmids (pEF1-Cbfa1 expressing Cbfa1, pCMV204 expressing p204, and pCMV 204AS expressing antisense p204 or combinations of these). 48 h after transfection, the cultures were harvested and lysed. Luciferase assays were performed using 20 μl of cell extract and 100 μl of luciferin substrate (Promega). β-Galactosidase assay were performed using a kit (Applied Biosystems/Tropix, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and luciferase activities were measured using a Mini-Lum liminometer (Bioscan, Washington, D. C.).Alkaline Phosphatase and Osteocalcin Assays—Previously generated inducible p204 stable and control lines (24Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 2.5 μm muristerone (Mur) for 1 day and then treated with 300 ng/ml recombinant BMP-2. Three days later, cells were lysed for ALP assay, and medium was used for OCL assay. In brief, the ALP assay mixtures contained 0.1 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (Sigma), 1 mm MgCl2, 8 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium, and cell homogenates. After 3-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 0.1 n NaOH, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. A standard curve was prepared with p-nitrophenol (Sigma). Each value was normalized to the protein concentration. The amount of OCL secreted into the culture medium was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a mouse osteocalcin assay kit (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA) per the manufacturer's protocol.In Vitro GST Pull-down Assay—For examination of the binding of p204 to Cbfa1 in vitro, glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl) preincubated with either purified GST (0.5 μg) (serving as control) or GST-204 (0.5 μg) were incubated with 500 μg of cell extracts from C2C12 cells transfected with a pEF-Cbfa1 expression plasmid in 150 μl of buffer AM (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH. 7.9, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Bound proteins were denatured in sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the Cbfa1 protein was detected by Western blotting with anti-Cbfa1 affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).To dissect the CBFA1 binding domains in p204, glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl) preincubated with either purified GST-204 (0.5 μg) or its deletion mutants (see Fig. 8A for details) were incubated with 500 μg of cell extract proteins from C2C12 cells transfected with a pEF-Cbfa1 expression plasmid in 150 μl of buffer AM.

As shown in Fig. 1, p204 antiserum specifically recognized only one band in the cell lysates (lane 3) with a molecular mass identical to that of in vitro translated (IVT) p204 (lane 1). This indicates that p204 is present in native osteoblasts.Fig. 1p204 is expressed in primary osteoblasts. In vitro translated (IVT) proteins using pBS204 (lane 1) and control vector (lane 2) as templates and cell lysates prepared from calvaria-derived primary osteoblasts (lane 3) were subjected to 10%SDS-PAGE and examined by Western blotting with anti-p204 antiserum. The p204 band is indicated by the arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether p204 is expressed in embryonic osteoblasts and to establish its subcellular localization, immunostaining for p204 was performed on tibial growth plates of mouse embryos on postcoital day 19. As shown in Fig. 2, p204 is highly expressed in osteoblasts and predominantly localized in the nucleus. In the growth plate, p204 is also highly expressed in differentiating hypertrophic chondrocytes but is absent in both resting and proliferating chondrocytes; these results suggest that p204 plays an important role in bone longitudinal growth.Fig. 2Immunohistochemistry of p204 in tibial growth plates of postcoital day 19 mouse embryos.

https://openalex.org/W2149165933,"ATP-gated P2X2 channels undergo activation-dependent permeability increases as they proceed from the selective I1 state to the I2 state that is readily permeable to organic cations. There are two main models about how permeability changes may occur. The first proposes that permeability change-competent P2X channels are clustered or redistribute to form such regions in response to ATP. The second proposes that permeability changes occur because of an intrinsic conformational change in P2X channels. In the present study we experimentally tested these views with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, electrophysiology, and mutational perturbation analysis. We found no evidence for clusters of P2X2 channels within the plasma membrane or for cluster formation in response to ATP, suggesting that channel clustering is not an obligatory requirement for permeability changes. We next sought to identify determinants of putative intrinsic conformational changes in P2X2 channels by mapping the transmembrane domain regions involved in the transition from the relatively selective I1 state to the dilated I2 state. Initial channel opening to the I1 state was only weakly affected by Ala substitutions, whereas dramatic effects were observed for the higher permeability I2 state. Ten residues appeared to perturb only the I1-I2 transition (Phe31, Arg34, Gln37, Lys53, Ile328, Ile332, Ser340, Gly342, Trp350, Leu352). The data favor the hypothesis that permeability changes occur because of permissive motions at the interface between first and second transmembrane domains of neighboring subunits in pre-existing P2X2 channels.

Activation-dependent changes in ionic selectivity for P2X channels imply that the selectivity filter may be dynamic and undergo conformational re-arrangements to switch its preference between ions (22Khakh B.S. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 653-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). Two different models are proposed to explain the ability of P2X channels to undergo permeability changes in response to ATP (22Khakh B.S. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 653-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The first, which we term the cluster model, suggests that I2 state-competent P2X channels represent clusters of accreted P2X channels/subunits, perhaps of higher oligomeric state, and that ATP triggers this process (22Khakh B.S. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 653-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The essential features of this hypothesis were first proposed in a pioneering study on mast cells (30Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. Nature. 1979; 279: 541-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This has recently drawn some support based on the observation of higher molecular weight, presumably P2X subunit-containing, bands on protein gels (6Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 9Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the finding that permeability changes in P2X channels are dependent on channel density (31Fujiwara Y. Kubo Y. J. Physiol. 2004; 558: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). First principles also suggest that the pore diameter would increase with the number of helices lining the pore (32Spencer R.H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in the case of P2X7 channels there is experimental evidence to suggest that channel redistribution and cluster formation may not be needed for pore dilation (23Smart M.L. Panchal R.G. Bowser D.N. Williams D.A. Petrou S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C77-C84Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis, which we term the gating model, proposes that permeability changes occur because of an intrinsic conformational change in the channels. This draws on findings with mutagenesis (16Khakh B.S. Bao X. Labarca C. Lester H.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 17Virginio C. MacKenzie A.

Khakh B.S. J. Gen.

(34Fisher J.A. Girdler G. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10475-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The gating model also draws indirect support from studies of mechanosensitive channels that are known to dilate from ∼2 to ∼30 Å because of an intrinsic conformational change involving helix tilting (35Doyle D.A. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 298-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Calculations also show that for channels with regular helices and ideal oligomeric symmetry an increase in pore diameter can be achieved with an increase in helical tilt (32Spencer R.H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus both the cluster and gating models have their merits, but no study has tested the models directly under a fixed set of experimental conditions or in the case of the cluster model, with approaches that have sufficient resolution to provide direct information about P2X2 channels in the plasma membrane. We tested the cluster model by imaging fluorophore labeled P2X2 channels in the plasma membrane with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (34Fisher J.A. Girdler G. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10475-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 37Riven I. Kalmanzon E. Segev L. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2003; 38: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our experiments provided no evidence to support the cluster model. We next sought to identify P2X2 subunit regions permissive for permeability changes in an effort to provide insight and constraints on the gating model. Ab initio there was no way to deduce which parts of the protein may be most important because there is no structural information on P2X channels, no related channels of known structure, and no channels with comparable primary sequence (1Khakh B.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 2North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2475) Google Scholar). Because of this quandary we sought to identify regions crucial for the gating model empirically with single site Ala substitutions and analysis of state-specific perturbations. We focused on the transmembrane segments because of their importance for channel function (11Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Migita K. Torres G.E. Egan T.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5885-5892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rassendren F.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9378-9386Google Scholar) and because no detailed study of the TM segments and their role in permeability changes exists. Overall the data are consistent with the gating model and the hypothesis that permeability changes occur because of spatially diverse, and perhaps extensive, molecular rearrangements in the transmembrane, pore, and cytosolic domains (34Fisher J.A. Girdler G. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10475-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) of pre-existing and stably expressed P2X2 channels. Molecular Biology—The cell lines used were HEK-293 cells transiently expressing appropriate wild type (wt), mutant, and fluorescently labeled channels. Some cDNAs were available from previous work (12Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Migita K. Torres G.E. Egan T.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5885-5892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Khakh B.S. Smith W.B.

Alan North (Sheffield University), and others were generated using standard procedures. cDNAs were propagated in DH5α Escherichia coli, and plasmids were purified using standard techniques. Plasmids encoding mem-Y were purchased from Clontech (pEYFP-Mem). For transient expression in HEK-293 cells 0.5–1 μg of plasmid cDNA was used (Effectene, Qiagen). TIRF Microscopy—Briefly, we used an Olympus IX70 scope equipped with a Princeton Instruments cooled I-PentaMAX camera with a High Blue Gen III Intensifier (Roper Scientific). The control of excitation and image acquisition was achieved using MetaMorph software and drivers (Universal Imaging), shutters, filter wheels, and Proscan II control box (Prior). The beams of 488/515 nm argon (150 milliwatt) and 442 nm helium-cadmium (12.5 milliwatt) lasers (Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA) at <5% power (constant for all experiments reported) were combined and controlled with an IX2-COMB (Olympus), Uniblitz shutters (Prior), and acoustoptical tunable filter and controller (AA Optoelectronics, Les Chevreuse, France) and fed into an optical fiber (FV5-FUR; Olympus) for entry into the TIRF condenser (IX2-RFAEVA-2; Olympus). Cells were plated onto glass-bottom Petri dishes (170 nm thick; Willco Wells BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands) 24–48 h before imaging and were viewed with a 60× oil immersion objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.45 (Olympus). The gain was adjusted for maximum signal-to-noise for each cell and kept constant for all image acquisitions. Electrophysiology—HEK-293 cells were used for recordings 24–48 h posttransfection, gently mechanically dispersed, and plated onto glass coverslips 2–12 h before use. We included this step (11Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to ensure adequate voltage clamp during reversal potential measurements from single spherical cells. The extracellular recording solution was comprised of (in mm) NaCl, 150; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1 (or 0.1); HEPES, 10; and glucose, 10 (pH 7.4), and the pipette solution was comprised of (in mm) NaCl (or CsCl or CsF), 154; EGTA, 11; and HEPES, 10. For some experiments, where stated, we replaced Na+ with equimolar substitutions of NMDG+ (16Khakh B.S. Bao X. Labarca C. Lester H.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 17Virginio C. MacKenzie A. Rassendren F.A. North R.A. Surprenant A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made with 5 MΩ borosilicate glass electrodes (Sutter Instruments), using an Axopatch-1D amplifier controlled by a computer running pCLAMP 8.1 software via a Digidata 1366 interface (Axon Instruments). Data were filtered at 0.5–2 kHz and digitized at 1–5 kHz. Drugs were applied to single cells by pressure-ejection using a Picospritzer (Intracell Ltd.), or in the bathing medium, which flowed at 2–3 ml/min. For pressure application (∼20 p.s.i.; 1 p.s.i. = 6.89 kPa), we used 2–4 MΩ pipettes as described previously (18Khakh B.S. Smith W.B. Chiu C.S. Ju D. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); solution exchange occurred in ∼10 ms. Solution exchange with the bath application occurred in ∼10–20 s, but no agonists were applied in this way. Voltage ramps (0.5-s duration) were usually applied every 0.5–1 s, but in some cases 0.1-s duration ramps every 0.1 s were also tested (34Fisher J.A. Girdler G. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10475-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). On the basis of initial experiments the voltage range was adjusted to be ∼40–60 mV either side of the reversal potential for each construct. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using published approaches (29Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, 33Eickhorst A. Berson A.

Physiol. 1980; 75: 469-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Calcium permeability (pCa2+/pNa+) was determined under bi-ionic conditions, as described (42Migita K. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30934-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ion permeability ratios were calculated from shifts in reversal potentials using the function pNMDG+/pNa+ = exp(ΔErevF/RT), where pNMDG+ is the permeability to NMDG+, pNa+ is the permeability to Na+, ΔErev is the shift in reversal potential, and F, R, and T have their usual meaning (33Eickhorst A. Berson A. Cockayne D. Lester H.A. Khakh B.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In some of the electrophysiological traces we used adjacent point averaging. All ramps shown in Figs. 3 and 5 are leak-subtracted. Electrophysiological analysis was performed with Clampfit (Axon Instruments) or Origin 6.1 (OriginLab Corp.), and all statistical tests were run in GraphPad Instat 3.0 (GraphPad Software). Desensitization was quantified as the percent current lost after 20–30 s of ATP (100 μm) relative to the peak response (Fig. 6). We used this simple approach to quantify desensitization because the decay kinetics could not always be adequately described by exponential functions with 1 or 2 components.

We studied homomeric P2X2 channels because they show robust permeability changes in all HEK cells, they can be labeled innocuously with GFP variants (18Khakh B.S. Smith W.B. Chiu C.S. Ju D.

Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). α helices are a common feature of the TM domains of ion channels (32Spencer R.H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cysteine and alanine scanning mutagenesis experiments also suggest that TM1 and TM2 of P2X2 are helical (11Egan T.M. Haines W.R.

No Evidence for Cluster Formation of Fluorophore-labeled P2X2 Channels—Recent work on Xenopus oocytes suggests that P2X2 channels may form clusters permissive for the I2 state when channel density is as low as ∼25 channels/μm2 (31Fujiwara Y. Kubo Y. J. Physiol. 2004; 558: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Previous work indicates that P2X2 channels expressed in mammalian cells are at a channel density of ∼1–3 channels/μm2 (18Khakh B.S. Smith W.B. Chiu C.S. Ju D. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Fisher J.A. Girdler G. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10475-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Available data suggest that P2X channels have a total of six transmembrane helices and based on electron microscopy studies of transmembrane proteins (45Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8641-8646Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) may form a particle of ∼8.4 nm2 in cross-sectional area. With a channel density of ∼1–25 channels/μm2 they thus occupy a minor part of the plasma membrane expanse in which they sit. Assuming a uniform distribution of ion channel coordinates, and a membrane protein diffusion coefficient of 10-10 cm2·s-1, estimates suggest any two random channels (at three per μm2) will on average stay ∼0.5 μm apart, but every ∼100 s they will come within ∼1 diameter of each other for ∼3 ms. For mammalian cells these considerations lead to the conclusion that clustering cannot occur randomly simply because there are too few channels for even the highest expression levels where permeability changes have been measured (16Khakh B.S.

https://openalex.org/W1998086302,"CD38 is an ADP-ribosyl cyclase, producing a potent Ca2+ mobilizer cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). In this study, we have investigated a role of CD38 and its regulation through interleukin-8 (IL8) signaling in lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Incubation of LAK cells with IL8 resulted in an increase of cellular cADPR level and a rapid rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which was sustained for a long period of time (>10 min). Preincubation of an antagonistic cADPR analog, 8-Br-cADPR (8-bromo-cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose), abolished the sustained Ca2+ signal only but not the initial Ca2+ rise. An inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonist blocked both Ca2+ signals. Interestingly, the sustained Ca2+ rise was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Functional CD38-null (CD38-) LAK cells showed the initial rapid increase of [Ca2+]i but not the sustained Ca2+ rise in response to IL8 treatment. An increase of cellular cADPR level by cGMP analog, 8-pCPT-cGMP (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate), but not cAMP analog or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was observed. IL8 treatment resulted in the increase of cGMP level that was inhibited by the IP3 receptor blocker but not a protein kinase C inhibitor. cGMP-mediated Ca2+ rise was blocked by 8-Br-cADPR. In addition, IL8-mediated LAK cell migration was inhibited by 8-Br-cADPR and a protein kinase G inhibitor. Consistent with these observations, IL8-induced migration of CD38- LAK cells was not observed. However, direct application of cADPR or 8-pCPT-cGMP stimulated migration of CD38- cells. These results demonstrate that CD38 is stimulated by sequential activation of IL8 receptor, IP3-mediated Ca2+ rise, and cGMP/protein kinase G and that CD38 plays an essential role in IL8-induced migration of LAK cells.

Several studies have indicated that cADPR synthesis by CD38 is stimulated through cell surface heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. The receptors include β-adrenergic receptor in cardiac myocytes (12Higashida H. Egorova A. Higashida C. Zhong Z.G. Yokoyama S. Noda M. Zhang J.S. J. Biol.

Franco L. De Flora A. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 118-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and cAMP-dependent activation of the enzyme is also observed in artery smooth muscle cells (13Boittin F.X. Dipp M. Kinnear N.P. Galione A. Evans A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9602-9608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of the activation of CD38 and/or ADPR-cyclases has not been clearly defined. A previous report has indicated that a peptide cytokine interleukin (IL) 8 signaling may utilize cADPR to mobilize [Ca2+]i in IL2-activated natural killer cells (18Inngjerdingen M. Al-Aoukaty A. Damaj B. Maghazachi A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). IL8, which belongs to the CXC superfamily of chemokines, plays an important role in the motility of various cells such as neutrophils and T cells (19Huber A.R. Kunkel S.L. Todd R.F. Weiss S.J. Science. 1991; 254: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 20Baggiolini M. Loetscher P. Moser B. Int. J.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). The IL8 receptor (IL8R) is made of seven transmembrane proteins and couples with Gi and stimulates the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) through the activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-β2 (24Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 25Neptune E.R. Iiri T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2824-2828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There is a report that the IL8Rs present in natural killer cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells may induce cADPR synthesis through the Gs-involved signaling pathway (26Maghazachi A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CD38 expression in natural killer and LAK cells is also observed (27Mallone R. Funaro A. Zubiaur M. Baj G. Ausiello C.M. Tacchetti C. Sancho J. Grocci C. Malavasi F. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Sconocchia G. Titus J.A. Mazzoni A. Visintin A. Pericle F. Hicks S.W. Malavasi F. Segal D.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of CD38 including cADPR in LAK cell functions and the activation pathways of CD38 remain elusive. In this study, we have investigated IL8-mediated regulation of CD38 by determining intracellular Ca2+ changes and motility of LAK cells. The results indicate that CD38 is activated via cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) that is activated by IL8 and that CD38 plays a critical role in IL8-mediated Ca2+ signal and migration of LAK cells. Reagents and Antibodies—Antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-human CD38 monoclonal antibody from BD Biosciences; anti-IL8R monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-PLC-β2 monoclonal antibody from P. G. Suh at POSTECH (Pohang, Korea); anti-IP3 receptor (IP3R) generously provided by S. H. Kim (Inha University, Incheon, Korea); anti-ryanodine receptor (RyR)common mouse monoclonal antibody from Calbiochem. Ficoll-Hypaque and Percoll were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Advanced Biochemicals Inc. (Jeonju, Korea). Human recombinant IL2 was purchased from Chiron BV (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Human recombinant IL8, human AB serum, and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. RPM1 1640 was from Invitrogen. 125I-cGMP radioimmunoassay kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Preparation of LAK Cells—LAK cells were prepared as described previously (29Melder R.J. Whiteside T.L. Vujanovic N.L. Hiserodt J.C. Herberman R.B. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3461-3469PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sebok K. Woodside D. Al-Aoukaty A. Ho A.D. Gluck S. Maghazachi A.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1524-1534PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood obtained from healthy volunteers was layered over Ficoll-Hypaque and centrifuged at 700 × g for 30 min to remove red blood cells. The red blood cells removed cell preparations were incubated on a nylon-wool column at 37 °C for 1 h in a 5% CO2 incubator to remove B lymphocytes and macrophages. Nylon-wool nonadherent cells were collected and further separated by a Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Four layers of Percoll were used: 37, 44, 52, and 60%. After centrifugation at 700 × g for 20 min, cells of the 52% Percoll layer were collected, washed with serum-free RPMI 1640, and incubated at 2 × 106 cells/ml density in a culture media containing 3000 IU/ml IL2 in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The culture medium used is RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% human AB serum, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoehanol. After incubation for 24 h, the floating cells were removed, and the adherent cells were cultured in the same culture media containing 1500 IU/ml IL2. LAK cells induced by IL2 for 10 days were used throughout the study, otherwise indicated in the figure legends. Induction of LAK cells was ensured by determining ADPR-cyclase activity as detailed below. Western Blotting—LAK cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with an ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, supernatants were taken. The extracts (20 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 5% gel to identify RyR or IP3R, and in a 10% gel to identify PLC-β2, IL8R, or CD38. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, blots were incubated in a blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature and then with primary antibodies (dilution factors were: CD38, 1:500; RyR, 1:100; IP3R, 1:2000; PLC-β2, 1:2000; IL8R, 1:200) in the blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The blots were rinsed four times with the blocking buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1: 5000 dilution) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution) in the blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive proteins with respective secondary antibodies were determined using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to BIOMAX films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and known concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used as the standard. Synthesis of cADPR—cADPR was synthesized using ADPR-cyclase purified from A. califonica ovotestes as described previously (31Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The nucleotide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using AG MP-1 resin (Bio-Rad). The nucleotide was eluted with a nonlinear gradient of 150 mm trifluoroacetic acid and water. Purified cADPR was dried using a SpeedVac concentrator. The purity of cADPR used in the study was ∼97% as determined by HPLC. Determination of ADPR-cyclase Activity—ADPR-cyclase activity was determined by fluorometrically using nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD+) as a substrate (32Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 200 μm NGD+ in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 10 min. Fluorescence of cGDPR produced was determined at excitation/emission wavelengths of 297/410 nm (Hitachi F-2000). β-NAD+-dependent Inactivation of CD38—LAK cells were incubated with 100 μm β-NAD+ for 6 h according to the method described previously (6Han M.K. Cho Y.S. Kim Y.S. Yim C.Y. Kim U.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20799-20805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and after incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and used for the study. Measurement of cADPRi—The level of [cADPR]i was measured using a cyclic enzymatic assay as described previously (33Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, LAK cells were treated with 0.5 ml of 0.6 m perchloric acid under sonication. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Perchloric acid was removed by mixing the aqueous sample with a solution containing 3 volumes of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane to 1 volume of tri-n-octlyamine. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 × g, the aqueous layer was collected and neutralized with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8). To remove all contaminating nucleotides, the samples were incubated with the following hydrolytic enzymes overnight at 37 °C: 0.44 unit/ml nucleotide pyrophosphatase, 12.5 units/ml alkaline phosphatase, 0.0625 unit/ml NADase, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Enzymes were removed by filtration using Centricon-3 filters. To convert cADPR to NAD+, the samples (0.1 ml/tube) were incubated with 50 μl of a cycling reagent containing 0.3 μg/ml Aplysia ADPR-cyclase, 30 mm nicotinamide, and 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8) at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were further incubated with the cycling reagent (0.1 ml) containing 2% ethanol, 100 μg/ml alcohol dehydrogenase, 20 μm resazurin, 10 μg/ml diaphorase, 10 μm riboflavin 5′-phosphate, 10 mm nicotinamide, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) for 2 h at room temperature. An increase in the resorufin fluorescence was measured at 544 nm excitation and 590 nm emission using a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Spectra-Max GEMINI). Various known concentrations of cADPR were also included in the cycling reaction to generate a standard curve. Measurement of Intracellular cGMP Level—Levels of cGMP were determined by a 125I-cGMP radioimmunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. LAK cells were preincubated with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine and phosphodiesterase inhibitor and then challenged with various reagents as detailed in the figure legends. After incubation for 30 min, cells were treated with equal volume of 12% trichloroacetic acid. To determine cGMP extraction efficacy, [3H]cGMP (1500 cpm) was added. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatants were collected and extracted four times with a 5-ml portion of water-saturated diethyl ether. The water part was collected, dried using SpeedVac, and dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.2). Prior to performing radioimmunoassay, the sample (100 μl) was acetylated using acetic anhydride in the presence of triethylamine. A standard curve of acetylated cGMP was also prepared as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—LAK cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (2 mm CaCl2, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) containing 1% BSA and incubated in the same solution containing 1% BSA for 6 h. Starved LAK cells were incubated with 5 μm Fluo3 AM (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% BSA at 37 °C for 40 min. The cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Changes in [Ca2+]i in LAK cells were determined at 488 nm excitation/530 nm emission by air-cooled argon laser system (34Xie G.H. Rah S.Y. Yi K.S. Han M.K. Chae S.W. Im M.J. Kim U.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The emitted fluorescence at 530 nm was collected using a photomultiplier. One image every 6 s for 10 min was scanned using confocal microscope (Nikon, Japan). For the calculation of [Ca2+]i, the method of Tsien et al. (35Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. Nature. 1982; 295: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) was used with the following equation: [Ca2+]i = Kd(F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), where Kd is 450 nm for Fluo-3 and F is the observed fluorescence levels. Each tracing was calibrated for the maximal intensity (Fmax) by the addition of ionomycin (8 μm) and for the minimal intensity (Fmin) by the addition of EGTA 50 mm at the end of each measurement. Determination of Cell Migration—Cell migration was determined as described previously (28Sconocchia G. Titus J.A. Mazzoni A. Visintin A. Pericle F. Hicks S.W. Malavasi F. Segal D.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed with RPMI 1640, scrapped using a policeman, and washed with RPM1 1640. Transwells (Costar Corning, Corning, NY) with 8-μm pore size polycarbonate filters 6.5 mm in diameter were used. Lower chambers contained 500 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 1% BSA. LAK cells (4 × 105) in 100 μl RPM1 1640 containing various agents (specified in the figure legends) were placed in the upper chamber. The chambers were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 h. The filters were removed, fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol, and stained with 15% Wright-Giemsa stain for 7 min. The cells were counted under a phase-contrast microscope. Statistical Analysis—Data represent means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.) of at least three separate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Induction of CD38 Expression in LAK Cells—Firstly, we assessed expression levels of CD38 along with the other related signaling molecules during induction of LAK cells by IL2 treatment. Expression of CD38 was gradually increased in a time-dependent manner and highly induced at 7–10 days (Fig. 1A). Expression of RyR, a putative receptor for cADPR, was also highly induced at 7–10 days. On the other hand, expression of IL8R, IP3R, and PLC-β2 was observed in the freshly isolated T cells and was not influenced by IL2 treatment (data not shown). Expression of CD38 was ascertained by measuring ADPR-cyclase activity using NGD+, which is converted to cGDPR only by the enzyme (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the above observations, the production of cGDPR in cell lysates was increased in a time-dependent manner. Next, we examined whether IL8 stimulates CD38 in LAK cells induced by treatment with IL2 for 10 days. As shown in Fig. 1C, [cADPR]i in LAK cells was increased significantly by the treatment with IL8. These results show that expression of CD38 and RyR along with transformation of T cells to LAK cells are induced by IL2 treatment and that IL8 signaling may activate CD38. IL8-mediated Elevation of [Ca2+]i Involves Activation of CD38—On the basis of the above observation that IL8 treatment increases [cADPR]i, the molecular basis of CD38 activation by IL8 in LAK cells was examined by determining IL8-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i under various conditions. The addition of IL8 to the cells resulted in a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, and the increased [Ca2+]i levels were sustained for more than 10 min (Fig. 2A). The pretreatment of an antagonistic cADPR analog, 8-Br-cADPR, abolished the IL8-mediated sustained Ca2+ signal but not the initial rapid increase (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, xestospongin C, an IP3 receptor antagonist, completely abolished both Ca2+ signals (Fig. 2C). In contrast, calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor, had no effect on the IL8-mediated increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2D). To examine whether the sustained Ca2+ increase is due to Ca2+ release from the intracellular store or Ca2+ influx, the IL8-mediated increase of [Ca2+]i was determined in the presence of EGTA. The sustained Ca2+ rise was not observed while the initial Ca2+ increase was present (Fig. 2E). The effects of various agents on the initial and sustained Ca2+ increases were summarized in Fig. 2, F and G, respectively. These results indicate that cADPR is responsible for IL8-mediated sustained Ca2+ influx that is dependent on the IP3-mediated initial Ca2+ rise in the LAK cells. Inactivation of CD38 by ADP-ribosylation Abolishes the Sustained Rise of [Ca2+]i Induced by IL8—We have previously demonstrated that CD38 in the activated T cells is ADP-ribosylated in the presence of exogenous β-NAD+, resulting in a loss of enzyme activity (6Han M.K. Cho Y.S. Kim Y.S. Yim C.Y. Kim U.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20799-20805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of CD38/cADPR in IL8-induced Ca2+ signaling, functional CD38-null (CD38-) LAK cells were prepared by treatment with β-NAD+. As shown in Fig. 3A, ADPR-cyclase activities, which were observed in the lysates and CD38 immunoprecipitates prepared from the control LAK cells, were completely eradicated by the incubation with β-NAD+. These results indicated that CD38 represents the only ADPR-cyclase in LAK cells but also indicate that CD38 is inactivated in the presence of β-NAD+, consistent with previous observations (6Han M.K. Cho Y.S. Kim Y.S. Yim C.Y. Kim U.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20799-20805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When IL8-mediated Ca2+ signal in CD38- LAK cells was compared with the control LAK cells (Fig. 3B), CD38- LAK cells showed only the initial rise of [Ca2+]i but not the sustained rise of [Ca2+]i by the treatment with IL8 (Fig. 3C). To ensure that the sustained Ca2+ signal is mediated by cADPR, changes of [Ca2+]i in the CD38- LAK cells were determined in the presence of cADPR. Indeed, cADPR was able to induce the sustained Ca2+ signal (Fig. 3D). As summarized in Fig. 3, E and F, the sustained Ca2+ increase is due to the activation of CD38/cADPR through IL8 signaling. CD38 Is Activated by cGMP Produced by IL8/Ca2+ Signaling—It has been demonstrated that ADPR-cyclases including CD38 are probably activated by cAMP or cGMP (13Boittin F.X. Dipp M. Kinnear N.P. Galione A. Evans A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9602-9608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Graeff R.M. Franco L. De Flora A. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 118-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Stimulation of IL8R produces two second messengers, IP3 and diacylglycerol. There is a report that IL8R may couple with Gs (26Maghazachi A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To elucidate activation mechanism of CD38 by IL8 signaling, we determined [cADPR]i in LAK cells treated with various agonistic agents. As presented in Fig. 4A, a membrane-permeable cGMP analog, 8-pCPT-cGMP, significantly increased the level of [cADPR]i that was comparable with that induced by IL8. Moreover, a membrane-permeable PKG inhibitor, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, blocked IL8-induced cADPR formation. On the other hand, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or the cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, or Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, was not able to increase [cADPR]i. We further examined whether cGMP is produced by stimulation of IL8R. The treatment of IL8 indeed increased the intracellular cGMP level, and the IL8-induced cGMP increase was completely blocked by xestospongin C but not by calphostin C (Fig. 4B). Supporting the result that ionomycin had no effect on cADPR formation, cGMP level was also not increased by the ionomycin treatment. The observations that initial Ca2+ rise proceeded to increase the sustained Ca2+ signal (Fig. 2, A and B) indicated that cGMP increase induced by IL8 may proceed to form cADPR. The time course of cGMP and cADPR formation induced by IL8 was evaluated. The results showed that levels of cGMP and cADPR were increased in a time-dependent manner, reaching maximal levels at ∼60 and 90 s, respectively (Fig. 4C). The formation of cGMP was rapidly reduced, whereas the formation of cADPR was slowly decreased. Supporting these results, a cGMP analog, 8-pCPT-cGMP, generated the sustained increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4D). The cGMP analog-mediated increase of [Ca2+]i was completely blocked by pretreatment with 8-Br-cADPR (Fig. 4E) but not by xestospongin C (Fig. 4F). Moreover, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS blocked IL8-induced sustained Ca2+ rise but not the initial Ca2+ rise (Fig. 4G). Differences in [Ca2+]i during initial and sustained increases of [Ca2+]i were summarized in Fig. 4, H and I, respectively. These findings indicate that cGMP is involved in the activation of CD38 in LAK cells and that IL8-induced cGMP formation is due to IP3-mediated Ca2+ rise. In addition, we also assessed whether phosphorylation of CD38 via cGMP/PKG during IL8 treatment occurred. Phosphorylation of CD38 was not observed. The increased production of cGDPR by CD38 isolated from LAK cells by immunoprecipitation with CD38 antibody was not observed in the presence of cGMP, PKG, or both together or Ca2+ (data not shown). cGMP/PKG/cADPR Signaling System Is Essential for IL8-induced Migratory Activity of LAK Cells—It is well known that the activation of IL8R induces migration of various cell types (19Huber A.R. Kunkel S.L. Todd R.F. Weiss S.J. Science. 1991; 254: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 20Baggiolini M. Loetscher P. Moser B. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1995; 17: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). To examine whether CD38/cADPR plays any role in IL8-mediated cell migration, we evaluated the effect of cADPR on the migratory activity of LAK cells. As presented in Fig. 5A, LAK cell migration was significantly induced by IL8. The IL8-mediated cell migration was blocked by pretreatment with 8-Br-cADPR. In addition, we also examined the effects of Ca2+ on LAK cell migration (Fig. 5A). IL8-induced cell migration was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and the increase of [Ca2+]i by ionomycin did not induce cell migration. The above observations that CD38/cADPR is involved in LAK cell migration were further examined using CD38- LAK cells. IL8-meidated migration of CD38- LAK cells was not observed (Fig. 5B). However, the treatment of CD38- LAK cells with exogenous cADPR stimulated cell migration similar to the control LAK cells induced by IL8. To further support the observation that cGMP is able to activate CD38, thus resulting in an increase of cADPR production, cGMP-mediated LAK cell migration was examined. An agonistic membrane-permeable cGMP analog, 8-pCPT-cGMP, stimulated the migratory activity of LAK cells independent of the activation of IL8R (Fig. 5C). The pretreatment of PKG inhibitor, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, completely blocked IL8-induced migration of LAK cells. These results indicate that CD38/cADPR plays an important role in IL8-mediated migration of LAK cells. CD38 is a bifunctional enzyme having ADPR-cyclase and hydrolase activity that produces and hydrolyzes cADPR, which is a powerful and universal Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger. Studies have proposed that CD38, including ADPR-cyclases, is activated by G-protein-coupled receptor. However, the regulation pathway(s) of CD38 by G-protein-coupled receptor remains unclear. In this study, we for the first time demonstrate that CD38 induced in LAK cells is stimulated by cGMP/PKG that is generated upon the activation of IL8R. Our results have also revealed that a CD38 metabolite, cADPR, plays an essential role in regulation of [Ca2+]i and migratory activity of LAK cells. The regulation pathway of CD38 in IL8 signaling is summarized in Fig. 6. IL8R couples with Gi and stimulates PLC-β2, producing two second messengers, IP3 and diacylglycerol (24Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 25Neptune E.R. Iiri T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2824-2828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The IL8 treatment of LAK cells exhibits a rapid rise of [Ca2+]i that sustains for a long period of time (>10 min). Our results show that the initial Ca2+ signal is mediated by IP3 and that the IL8-mediated sustained Ca2+ signal is due to the activation of CD38, resulting in an increase of [cADPR]i. Thus, the pretreatment of cells with 8-Br-cADPR, an antagonistic analog of cADPR, displays only the initial rise of [Ca2+]i. An IP3R blocker, xestospongin C, abolishes completely the IL8-mediated elevation of the initial and sustained [Ca2+]i, indicating that the activation of CD38 requires the IP3-mediated increase of [Ca2+]i. However, in contrast to IL8-induced formation of cADPR via IP3-mediated Ca2+ rise, nonphysiological elevation of [Ca2+]i by ionomycin does not increase the level of [cADPR]i. Consistent with our results, a previous report demonstrates that increase of [Ca2+]i by thapsigargin or ionomycin is not able to elevate the level of [cADPR]i, whereas the treatment of human Jurkat T cells with agonistic OKT3 antibody increases the level of cADPR as well as the sustained Ca2+ signal (10Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Together, it appears that CD38 in LAK cells, including T cells, is not activated unspecifically by increased [Ca2+]i. Our results also indicate that cADPR induces Ca2+ influx in LAK cells. The depletion of extracellular Ca2+ using EGTA generates the initial Ca2+ rise but not the sustained Ca2+ signal in response to IL8. CD38/cADPR-mediated Ca2+ entry has been observed with neutrophils (11Partida-Sanchez S. Cockayne D.A. Monard S. Jacobson E.L. Oppenheimer N. Garvy B. Kusser K. Goodrich S. Howard M. Harmsen A. Randall T.D. Lund F.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and intact human T cells (36Guse A.H. Berg I. da Silva C.P. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8546-8550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A recent study has reported that type 3 RyR plays an essential role in the sustained Ca2+ response in T cells (37Schwarzmann N. Kunerth S. Weber K. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50636-50642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism by which cADPR-mediated sustained Ca2+ rise remains to be clarified, our results strongly suggest that cADPR produced by CD38 is a Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger and mediates the sustained phase of Ca2+ signal by means of Ca2+ influx in LAK cells. Studies have indicated that cAMP activates the production of cADPR in artery smooth muscle cell (13Boittin F.X. Dipp M. Kinnear N.P. Galione A. Evans A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9602-9608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that cGMP is the activator of A. califonica ADPR-cyclase (17Graeff R.M. Franco L. De Flora A. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 118-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the activation of CD38 expressed in LAK cells is mediated by PKG activation via cGMP generated by IL8 signaling. Thus, the treatment of various agents shows that cGMP increases [cADPR]i in LAK cells. Consistent with these results, cGMP induces the sustained rise of [Ca2+]i, and a PKG blocker, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, abolishes the sustained Ca2+ signal but not the initial Ca2+ signal in response to IL8. More importantly, IL8-induced increase of cGMP precedes the production of cADPR. These results demonstrate that the activation of IL8R increases cGMP production in LAK cells and that cGMP/PKG regulates CD38 activity. However, it appears that cGMP/PKG does not directly act on the enzyme; neither PKG-mediated phosphorylation of CD38 nor cGMP-mediated activation of isolated CD38 using the CD38 antibody is observed. Our results have indicated that CD38/cADPR plays a critical role in the IL8-mediated migration of LAK cells. Thus, IL8-mediated cell migration is blocked by an antagonistic cADPR analog, 8-Br-cADPR, and by inactivation of CD38 with β-NAD+. Moreover, cADPR alone is able to induce LAK cell migration. Consistent with the observations that cGMP/PKG signaling activates CD38, the pretreatment of the PKG inhibitor blocks IL8-mediated migration of LAK cells. We have also found that IL8-induced LAK cell migration is strictly controlled by Ca2+ influx; in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, IL8-induced migration of LAK cells is not observed, and nonphysiological increase of [Ca2+]i with ionomycin does not induce cell migration. A previous study has also indicated that dendritic cell trafficking depends on Ca2+ influx induced by CD38/cADPR (38Partida-Sanchez S. Goodrich S. Kusser K. Oppenheimer N. Randall T.D. Lund F.E. Immunity. 2004; 20: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that the biological role of CD38/cADPR in LAK cells as well as natural killer cells isolated is to trigger lytic and secretory responses (27Mallone R. Funaro A. Zubiaur M. Baj G. Ausiello C.M. Tacchetti C. Sancho J. Grocci C. Malavasi F. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This cytotoxic role of CD38 has been observed by direct ligation of CD38 with an agonist antibody IB4 (39Cesano A. Visonneau S. Deaglio S. Malavasi F. Santoli D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1106-1115PubMed Google Scholar). The main signaling event in the cytotoxicity seems to be an involvement of protein tyrosine kinase(s) signaling via binding of the agonistic antibody IB4 to CD38 (39Cesano A. Visonneau S. Deaglio S. Malavasi F. Santoli D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1106-1115PubMed Google Scholar, 40Zubiaur M. Izquierdo M. Terhorst C. Malavasi F. Sancho J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 193-205PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, CD38 plays important roles in migration and cytotoxicity of LAK cells, including natural killer cells. The present study shows the regulation-signaling pathway of CD38 through the sequential coupling of IL8R, Ca2+ and cGMP/PKG and describes the biological role of CD38 in this signaling pathway, which is involvement in IL8-induced cell migration through the generation of cADPR/sustained Ca2+ elevation.

We designed a variant of this system, consisting of membranes, p67phox, prenylated Rac1-GDP, and the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Trio, in which oxidase activation is induced in the absence of an activator and p47phox. We now show that: 1) Trio and another Rac GEF (Tiam1) act by inducing GDP to GTP exchange on prenylated Rac1-GDP and that our earlier assertion that activation is GTP-independent is explained by contamination of p67phox preparations with GTP and/or ATP. 2) Oxidase activation by Rac GEFs is supported not only by GTP but also by ATP. 3) Non-hydrolysable GTP analogs are active, whereas ATP analogs, incapable of γ-phosphoryl transfer, are inactive. 4) The ability of ATP to support GEF-induced oxidase activation is explained by ATP serving as a γ-phosphoryl donor for a membrane-localized nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), converting GDP to GTP. 5) The existence of a NDPK in macrophage membranes is proven by functional, enzymatic, and immunologic criteria. 6) NDPK acts on free GDP, and the newly formed GTP is bound again to Rac. 7) Free GDP is derived exclusively by dissociation from prenylated Rac1-GDP, mediated by GEF. NDPK and GEF appear to be functionally linked in the sense that the availability of GDP, serving as substrate for NDPK, is dependent on the level of activity of GEF.

Phagocytes are bearers of an enzyme complex capable of responding with the production of microbicidal oxygen-derived radicals to a variety of stimuli acting on membrane receptors.

In resting phagocytes, the components of the future complex exist as distinct entities, and these are a membrane-associated flavocytochrome b559 (a heterodimer of two subunits, gp91phox and p22phox) and four cytosolic components, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac (Rac1 or 2) (reviewed in Ref. 3Quinn M.T. Gauss K.A. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 76: 760-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Oxidase activation is the consequence of the interaction of cytochrome b559 with the cytosolic components, involving translocation of the latter to the membrane. The process comprises a complex set of protein-protein interactions and is defined as oxidase assembly (reviewed in Refs. 3Quinn M.T. Gauss K.A. J. Leukoc.

Oxidase assembly in the intact cell can be reproduced in vitro in a cell-free system, consisting of phagocyte membranes or purified cytochrome b559 mixed with the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and Rac, supplemented with an anionic amphiphile serving as activator (5Bromberg Y.

Subsequently, it was found that oxidase activation in vitro can be achieved in the absence of p47phox but not in the absence of p67phox and Rac (10Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

This supports a model of oxidase assembly in which p67phox functions as the paramount cytosolic “activator,” interacting with gp91phox to initiate electron flow from NADPH to oxygen, with p47phox and Rac serving as “organizers” of the p67phox-gp91phox interaction (12Han C-H.

This was demonstrated by the ability of Rac1, purified from macrophages (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W.

There is also a large body of evidence for a key role of Rac in the regulation of phagocyte oxidase in vivo (19Dorseuil O. Vazquez A. Lang P. Bertoglio J. Gacon G. Leca G. J. Biol.

The physiologic form of both Rac1 and Rac2 in phagocytes is that of a C-terminally prenylated (geranylgeranylated) protein (22Kinsella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9786-9794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cytosol, both isomers are found exclusively as heterodimers with the regulatory protein GDP dissociation inhibitor for Rho (RhoGDI) (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W.

In accordance with the general rule applying to the role of small GTPases as on/off switches, the oxidase-activating function of both Rac1 (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was found to be dependent on these being in the GTP-bound form. This is rooted in the fact that optimal interaction of Rac with its principal target among oxidase components, p67phox, occurs when Rac is in the GTP-bound form (25Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Under certain in vitro conditions, however, the absolute GTP dependence of Rac is less evident. Thus, a Rac1-RhoGDI complex purified from the cytosol of macrophages (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W.

Grizot S. Molnar G. Pick E. Dagher M-C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10014-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), activated the oxidase in the absence of any source of exogenous GTP. Rac1 complexed to RhoGDI was found to be exclusively in the GDP-bound form (26Bromberg Y. Shani E. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Sperling O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7055-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was suggested that binding of Rac1-GDP to RhoGDI stabilizes Rac1 in an “active” conformation (27Di-Poi N. Faure J. Grizot S. Molnar G. Pick E. Dagher M-C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10014-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Finally, Rac was also found to bind directly to cytochrome b559, in both GTP- and GDP-bound forms (28Diebold B.A. Fowler B. Lu J. Dinauer M.C. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To focus on the role of Rac in oxidase assembly, we designed a cell-free system, consisting of only three components: phagocyte membranes, recombinant p67phox, and recombinant prenylated Rac1. In this system, O2⋅¯ was generated, in the absence of both p47phox and amphiphilic activator, and was associated with the recruitment of Rac1 and p67phox to the membrane (29Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A key question in all schemes of oxidase activation is the mechanism by which Rac is switched from the inactive to the active form. Bokoch and coworkers (18Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed a model in which a hypothetical membrane localized guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) is responsible for nucleotide exchange on Rac from GDP to GTP, dissociation from RhoGDI, and translocation to the membrane. Recently, a GEF acting on Rac (P-Rex1) was isolated from neutrophil cytosol and shown to be involved in oxygen radical production in the intact cell (31Welch H.C.E. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D.

We recently reported that the Rac GEF Trio markedly enhances oxidase activation in an amphiphile- and p47phox-independent cell-free system, consisting of membrane, p67phox, and prenylated Rac1 in the GDP-bound form (32Sigal N. Gorzalczany Y. Sarfstein R. Weinbaum C. Zheng Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 4854-4861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the introductory part of the present report, we show that, contrary to our original claim, oxidase activation by Trio is GTP-dependent. The main part of the report deals with the finding that oxidase activation by Rac GEFs is also supported by ATP, serving as a source of GTP. In this pathway, GEF causes dissociation of GDP from prenylated Rac1-GDP, to be followed by the ATP-driven conversion of Rac-derived GDP to GTP by a membrane-bound nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), and the binding of GTP to Rac. Chemicals and Reagents—ATP (disodium salt, 99%), ADP (sodium salt, 95–99%), GTP (lithium salt, 97%), GDP (sodium salt, type I, 98%), and GMP (disodium salt, 99%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The hydrolysis-resistant nucleotide analogs AMPPNP (tetralithium salt, 88%, <0.1% ATP), ATPγS (lithium salt, >90%), GMPPNP (tetralithium salt, 83%, <0.2% GTP), and GTPγS (lithium salt, 92%) were purchased from Roche Applied Science. The following chemicals and enzymes were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (octyl glucoside), phosphoenolpyruvic acid (trisodium salt hydrate, >97%), pyruvate kinase (rabbit muscle, type VII, solution in 50% glycerol, 1428 units/ml), lactic dehydrogenase (bovine heart, type XVII, solution in 50% glycerol, 2500 units/ml), deoxythymidine 5′-diphosphate (sodium salt, 97%), β-NADH (dipotassium salt, >98%), and NDPK (bovine liver, buffered aqueous glycerol solution, 1466 or 1500 units/mg of protein, corresponding to two lots of enzyme).

To obtain higher purity preparations, the material was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR 5/5 fast performance liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol and p67phox was eluted by a 30-ml linear gradient of NaCl in equilibration buffer, from 0 to 0.5 m, at a flow of 0.5 ml/min. The highest purity fractions (>95%), eluting at a conductivity of 15–17 mS/cm, were used in all the experiments to be described. p67phox truncated at residue 212 was produced as described before (29Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An N-terminal fragment of human Trio, containing the N-terminal Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (residues 1225–1537), to be referred as TrioN, was expressed and purified as described earlier (32Sigal N.

Chem. 2002; 278: 4854-4861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). cDNA corresponding to a fragment of mouse Tiam1, encompassing the DH domain and the adjacent C-terminal PH domain (residues 1033–1406) and carrying an N-terminal His6 tag, was cloned in the expression vector pProEX HT (Invitrogen) and used to transform E. coli. The cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. The His6-tagged protein, to be referred as Tiam1 DH/PH, was purified using the procedure used for His6-tagged TrioN. Purification of Baculovirus-derived p67phox—Baculovirus-derived p67phox was prepared and purified on a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) by a modification (35Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) of the procedure of Leto et al. (36Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions of highest purity eluted from the column at a buffer conductivity of 15–17 mS/cm. However, material with lower p67phox content and lesser purity was also present in fractions eluting at a lower buffer conductivity range (13–15 mS/cm) and was present is some batches of p67phox. Fractionation of Mock-infected Sf9 Cell Cytosol—Sf9 cells were infected with wild-type baculovirus (BD Pharmingen) and grown for 72 h under conditions identical to those employed for growing cells infected with p67phox recombinant baculovirus. A cytosolic fraction was prepared and subjected to fractionation on a Q-Sepharose column by the procedure used for the fractionation of p67phox. Fractions eluting in a wide buffer conductivity range (9–19 mS/cm) were collected. These fractions were expected to contain substances derived from the Sf9 cells, with an isoelectric point close to that of p67phox. Material derived from fractionation of Sf9 cells cytosol on Q-Sepharose was further characterized by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Concentration—This was estimated by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) and modified for use with 96-well microplates, using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent concentrate and bovine γ-globulin as standard. Enzymatic Prenylation of Rac1—Recombinant non-prenylated Rac1 was prenylated in vitro by recombinant geranylgeranyltransferase type I, as described before (38Gorzalczany Y. Alloul N. Sigal N. Weinbaum C. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18605-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The level of prenylation was assessed as described in Ref. 39Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar. Cell-free NADPH Oxidase Activation Assay—Oxidase activation in vitro supported by prenylated Rac1 was assessed by measuring NADPH-dependent O2⋅¯ production in a semi-recombinant cell-free system, in the absence of an amphiphilic activator and of p47phox, essentially as described earlier (29Gorzalczany Y.

Identification and Quantification of Nucleotides—Free nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMPPNP, GTP, and GDP) as well as bound nucleotides released from recombinant Rac1 were identified and quantified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Partisil 10 SAX anion exchange column (250 × 4.6 mm) (Whatman), as described before (32Sigal N. Gorzalczany Y. Sarfstein R. Weinbaum C. Zheng Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 4854-4861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Extraction of Protein-bound Nucleotides and Separation of Nucleotides from Mixtures Containing Proteins—In the course of the experiments to be described, it was required to isolate and quantify GDP or GTP bound to Rac1 or nucleotides generated in the course of enzymatic reactions containing proteins. For these purposes, we applied the method described in Ref. 40Perrett D. Lim C.K. HPLC of Small Molecules: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 221-259Google Scholar. The protein was precipitated by the addition of perchloric acid, to result in a final concentration of 1 n. The acid pH was raised to 7 by the addition of a solution containing 1.5 m KOH and 0.5 m KHCO3, and the precipitated protein sedimented by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant was filtered using a Microcon centrifugal filter device with a membrane cut-off of 10 kDa (YM-10, Millipore), centrifuged at 12,000 × g, also at room temperature, and the filtrate was injected in the Partisil 10 SAX column. Measurement of NDPK Activity—NDPK activity was measured by following the formation of ADP from ATP in a coupled pyruvate kinaselactate dehydrogenase system (41Agarwal R.P. Robison B. Parks R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 3 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 2 mm ATP, 1.25 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.25 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 0.3 mm NADH, 0.4 mm deoxythymidine 5′-diphosphate, and the material to be assayed for NDPK activity, in 80 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 1 ml. All components of the mixture, with the exception of thymidine 5′-diphosphate, were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C in a quartz glass cuvette and placed in a double-beam spectrophotometer (Uvikon 943, Kontron), and the reaction was started by the addition of deoxythymidine 5′-diphosphate. The rate of oxidation of NADH, reflecting the formation of ADP from ATP, was followed by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, for 2–4 min, and calculations were based on an extinction coefficient for reduced NADH of 6.22 mm-1 cm-1 (42Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activities were expressed as micromoles of ADP/min/mg of protein. The measured values were corrected for background rates by running assays in the absence of deoxythymidine 5′-diphosphate and of the NDPK-containing material (41Agarwal R.P. Robison B. Parks R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As a control for the specificity of the reaction, measurements were also performed in mixtures in which ATP was replaced by AMPPNP, which cannot serve as a substrate for NDPK. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described in Ref. 43Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23577-23585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. NDPK was detected with two types of antibody. The first was a rabbit polyclonal antibody, raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to an inner region shared by human NDPK isoforms A and B (nm23/NDP kinase Ab-1, Labvision). This antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The other was a mouse monoclonal antibody produced by immunization with purified human NDPK isoform A (nm23-H1 (NM301), Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and was used at dilution of 1:250, also in blocking buffer. The second antibodies were an affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer, to follow the rabbit polyclonal antibody, and an affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer to follow the mouse monoclonal antibody. Exposure of blots to the first antibodies was for 2 h and to the second antibodies, for 1 h. Alkaline phosphatase activity on the blots was detected as described in Ref. 44Blake M.S. Johnston K.H.

Difficulty in Repeating the Finding that TrioN-dependent Oxidase Activation Does Not Involve GDP to GTP Exchange on Rac1—Trio is a member of the Dbl family of GEFs and contains two distinct guanine nucleotide exchange domains, specific for Rac and Rho, respectively (45Debant A. Sierra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S-H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A recombinant N-terminal segment of Trio (residues 1225–1537), which includes the Rac-specific DH and PH domains (TrioN), was found to stimulate GDP to GTP exchange on Rac1 (46Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We recently reported that TrioN activates the oxidase in a cell-free system consisting of macrophage membranes, p67phox, and prenylated Rac1-GDP, in the absence of amphiphile and p47phox (32Sigal N. Gorzalczany Y. Sarfstein R. Weinbaum C. Zheng Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 4854-4861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We, initially, found that activation occurred in the absence of exogenous GTP and proposed that the effect of TrioN did not involve GDP to GTP exchange on Rac1 but was explained by a Trio-induced conformational change in Rac1-GDP. This conclusion was based on experiments in which the source of p67phox was recombinant protein produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, purified by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose. Attempts to confirm this finding by using different batches of baculovirus-derived p67phox revealed that some were unable to support GTP-independent oxidase activation. We also found that recombinant p67phox produced in E. coli uniformly failed to support amphiphile- and p47phox-independent oxidase activation by TrioN and prenylated Rac1-GDP, in the absence of added GTP. Therefore, we suspected that a material present in some but not all baculovirus p67phox preparations and absent in p67phox preparations from E. coli was required for TrioN-dependent oxidase activation by prenylated Rac1-GDP. Thus, we subjected baculovirus p67phox preparations, capable of supporting GTP-independent oxidase activation by TrioN, to heat inactivation at 80 °C or filtration through a membrane rejecting molecules larger than 3 kDa. We found that both forms of “inactivated” baculovirus p67phox preparations reconstituted the deficient oxidase activation by p67phox from E. coli to levels reported previously (32Sigal N. Gorzalczany Y. Sarfstein R. Weinbaum C. Zheng Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 4854-4861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with active baculovirus p67phox. We suspected that the material originated in the cytosol of Sf9 cells. To identify the responsible component, we prepared cytosol from Sf9 cells infected with wild-type baculovirus and subjected this to fractionation on Q-Sepharose by mimicking the conditions used to purify p67phox. We did, indeed, identify a material eluting at a buffer conductivity of 13–15 mS/cm, capable of restoring the defective ability of p67phox from E. coli to support GTP-independent oxidase activation by prenylated Rac1-GDP and TrioN. Size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 demonstrated that the one or more active components were of a size of <1 kDa. Applying this material to a Partisil 10 SAX column, under conditions allowing the separation and identification of nucleotides,"
https://openalex.org/W2089701375,"The overall structure of integrins is that of a ligand-binding head connected to two long legs. The legs can exhibit a pronounced bend at the “knees,” and it has been proposed that the legs undergo a dramatic straightening when integrins transit from a low affinity to a high affinity state. The knee region contains domains from both α and β subunits, including the N-terminal plexin/semaphorin/integrin (PSI) domain of the β subunit. The role played by the knee domains in the regulation of integrin-ligand binding is uncertain. Here we show that: (i) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) N29 and 8E3 have epitopes in the β1 subunit PSI domain and stimulate ligand binding to α5β1; (ii) N29 and 8E3 cause long range conformational changes that alter the ligand binding activity of the head region; (iii) the stimulatory action of these mAbs is dependent on the calf-1 domain, which forms part of the α subunit knee; and (iv) the epitopes of 8E3 and N29 map close to the extreme N terminus of the PSI and are likely to lie on the side of this domain that faces the α subunit. Taken together, our data suggest that the binding of these mAbs results in a levering apart of the PSI and calf-1 domains, and thereby causes the α and β subunit knees to separate. Several major inferences can be drawn from our findings. First, the PSI domain appears to form part of an interface with the α subunit that normally restrains the integrin in a bent state.

Integrins provide a crucial bridge between the inside and outside environments of the cell by linking the surrounding matrix of a cell to its cytoskeletal framework (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). These receptors are α,β heterodimers, and both subunits have large extracellular domains and short intracellular regions. Integrins carry a two-way flow of information (inside the cell to out, and outside to in). To achieve this bidirectional signaling integrins must convey shape changes over a long distance, from the intracellular domains to the extracellular regions and vice versa (2Humphries M.J. McEwan P.A. Barton S.J. Buckley P.A. Bella J. Mould A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Travis M.A. Humphries J.D. Humphries M.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 192-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in most cases binding of integrins to their extracellular ligands has to be tightly controlled. For example, the interaction of αIIbβ3 with fibrinogen during platelet aggregation needs to be restricted to sites of vessel injury. Regulation of ligand binding is achieved by switching of an integrin between a constitutive low affinity (inactive) state and a high affinity (primed) state. In addition, the interaction of ligands with integrin stabilizes the high affinity state and may cause further shape shifting (ligand-activated state) (4Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 1-10Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 5Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of the conformational changes involved is currently uncertain. The recent crystal structures of the extracellular domains of αVβ3 (6Xiong J-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B.

Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar) have provided new insights into integrin function. Overall, the integrin structure resembles that of a “head” on two “legs.” The head region contains a seven-bladed β propeller in the α subunit, the upper surface of which is in close association with a von Willebrand factor type A domain in the β subunit (βA). 1The abbreviations used are: βA, β subunit von Willebrand factor type A domain; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MIDAS, metal-ion dependent adhesion site; ADMIDAS, adjacent to MIDAS; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PSI, plexin/semaphorin/integrin.1The abbreviations used are: βA, β subunit von Willebrand factor type A domain; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MIDAS, metal-ion dependent adhesion site; ADMIDAS, adjacent to MIDAS; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PSI, plexin/semaphorin/integrin. βA (also referred to as the I-like domain or βI domain) contains a central β sheet encircled by seven α helices. βA is connected at its N and C termini to an immunoglobulin-like “hybrid” domain and forms an extensive interface with it. The key regions involved in ligand recognition are loops on the upper surface of the β propeller and the top face of βA, which contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). The βA domain can exist in low affinity and high affinity states, and the conformation of this domain is the critical determinant of ligand binding affinity (8Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10215-10221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). An unexpected feature of the αVβ3 structure was a cramping bend in both the α and β subunits at a region termed the “genu” (or “knee”), such that the head region was folded down between the legs. The knee region involves the thigh and calf-1 domains in the α subunit, and the plexin/semaphorin/integrin (PSI) domain and EGF repeats 1 and 2 in the β subunit. The β subunit knee domains were not clearly resolved in the structure, suggesting that the knee may be flexible rather than rigid. Initially, the bent αVβ3 structure presented a puzzle of how transmission of conformational change from the cytoplasmic tails to the head domains could take place in the native integrin, particularly in view of the rather flexible knees. Furthermore, in the bent state the head region would be pointing toward the cell surface and would not be in the appropriate orientation to interact with extracellular ligands. Small structural movements were observed in an αvβ3 crystal structure soaked with a Arg-Gly-Asp ligand-mimetic peptide (7Xiong J-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar), but probably because of crystal contact constraints, these changes were limited to the head region and did not provide a mechanism for long range propagation of conformational change. Recently, it has been proposed that the bent state of the integrin represents a low affinity conformation and that acquisition of the high affinity conformation involves an unbending of the knees to form an extended state (12Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Major support for this model comes from studies of soluble recombinant integrins by electron microscopy (13Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), which show that αVβ3 is bent under conditions in which it is poorly active (e.g. in the presence of Ca2+) and extended in the presence of Mn2+ or ligand peptides (which promote the high affinity conformer). It has also been shown that constraining αVβ3 or αIIbβ3 in a bent form with a disulfide bond results in a low affinity state (13Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), whereas promoting unbending with a glycan wedge favors the high affinity state (14Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The presence of activation state-dependent epitopes throughout the head and leg regions also provides evidence for large scale conformational rearrangements (15Humphries M.J. Symonds E.J. Mould A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that unbending of the knee regions allows an outward movement of the hybrid domain which shifts the βA domain into a high affinity state (9Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A.

Although considerable evidence has been presented that β3 and β2 integrins undergo unbending at the knees (12Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct.

Furthermore, the precise nature of the conformational changes that take place during unbending are unclear. Among the domains found in the knee region, the PSI is particularly mysterious. Although this domain is conserved in integrins throughout all metazoa, its function is unknown. The PSI domain is found at the N terminus of the β subunit and precedes the hybrid domain. The epitopes of some stimulatory anti-β3 mAbs map to the PSI (18Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and it is also an important site of drug-induced epitopes. Induction of these epitopes leads to platelet destruction by the immune system in some patients treated with αIIbβ3 antagonists (19Aster R.H. Curtis B.R. Bougie D.W. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2004; 30: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and therefore an understanding of the role of the PSI domain in integrin priming is also of clinical importance. A previously characterized anti-β1 mAb whose epitope lies in this region of the subunit is N29 (20Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3046-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). N29 stimulates cell adhesion, and agents such as Mn2+ and dithiothreitol, which are known to stimulate integrin function, induce expression of its epitope (21Ni H. Li A. Simonsen N. Wilkins J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A novel mAb 8E3, developed in our own laboratory, also stimulates cell adhesion, and its epitope appears to lie in the N-terminal region of β1 (22Coe A.P.F. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35854-35866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that N29 and 8E3 stimulate ligand binding through a mechanism that requires the calf-1 domain of the α subunit leg. Both mAbs have epitopes at the extreme N terminus of the PSI domain, and we show that binding of these antibodies to the integrin is likely to wedge apart the α and β knee regions, resulting in unbending. Monoclonal Antibodies—Mouse anti-human β1 mAbs 12G10 and 8E3 were produced as described previously (22Coe A.P.F. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

We recently reported a mAb 8E3 that binds to β1 constructs containing the N-terminal region of β1 but does not bind to a construct lacking the first 119 amino acids of β1, suggesting that its epitope could lie in the same region of the subunit as N29 (22Coe A.P.F.

https://openalex.org/W2030635080,"Classical cadherin adhesion molecules can function as adhesion-activated cell-signaling receptors. One key target for cadherin signaling is the lipid kinase phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase, which is recruited to cell-cell contacts and activated by E-cadherin. In this study, we sought to identify upstream factors necessary for E-cadherin to activate PI 3-kinase signaling. We found that inhibition of tyrosine kinase signaling blocked recruitment of PI 3-kinase to E-cadherin contacts and abolished the ability of E-cadherin to activate PI 3-kinase signaling. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors further perturbed several parameters of cadherin function, including cell adhesion and the ability of cells to productively extend nascent cadherin-adhesive contacts. Notably, the functional effects of tyrosine kinase blockade were rescued by expression of a constitutively active form of PI 3-kinase that restores PI 3-kinase signaling. Finally, using dominant negative Src mutants and Src-null cells, we identified Src as one key upstream kinase in the E-cadherin/PI 3-kinase-signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that tyrosine kinase activity, notably Src signaling, can contribute positively to cadherin function by supporting E-cadherin signaling to PI 3-kinase."

This complex provides the first insight into the structure of EF-Tsmt. EF-Tsmt is similar to Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus EF-Ts in the amino-terminal domain. However, the structure of EF-Tsmt deviates considerably in the core domain with a five-stranded β-sheet forming a portion of subdomain N of the core. In E. coli EF-Ts, this region is composed of a three-stranded sheet. The coiled-coil domain of the E. coli EF-Ts is largely eroded in EF-Tsmt, in which it consists of a large loop packed against subdomain C of the core. The conformation of bovine EF-Tumt in complex with EF-Tsmt is distinct from its conformation in the EF-Tumt·GDP complex. When domain III of bovine EF-Tumt·GDP is superimposed on domain III of EF-Tumt in the EF-Tumt·Tsmt complex, helix B from domain I is also almost superimposed. However, the rest of domain I is rotated relative to this helix toward domain II, which itself is rotated toward domain I relative to domain III. Extensive contacts are observed between the amino-terminal domain of EF-Tsmt and domain I of EF-Tumt.

Protein biosynthesis is the process by which the ribosome translates the sequence of nucleotides in a mRNA into the sequence of amino acids in a protein. During the cyclic elongation phase, the ribosome is assisted by elongation factors (EFs) 1The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; SeMet, seleno-l-methionine; P-loop, phosphate binding loop; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MAD, multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion; PEG, polyethylene glycol.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, elongation factor EF-Tu promotes the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the A-site of the mRNA-programmed ribosome in the form of the ternary complex aa-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP (3Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Upon cognate interaction between the codon of mRNA and the anticodon of aa-tRNA, GTP is hydrolyzed, and EF-Tu·GDP is released from the ribosome. The nucleotide exchange factor, EF-Ts, binds the EF-Tu·GDP complex mediating the release of the GDP and forms a stable EF-Tu·Ts complex (1Czworkowski J. Moore P.B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 293-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high concentrations of GTP in the cell help dissociate EF-Ts leaving the active EF-Tu·GTP complex. EF-Tu·GTP binds another aa-tRNA, forming a new ternary complex, and the cycle is repeated. Mitochondria contain a highly specialized protein biosynthetic machinery that is responsible for the synthesis of 13 polypeptides of the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase in the inner membrane (4Scheffler I.E. Mitochondria. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). The mitochondrial translational system has a number of unique features including an altered genetic code, unusual protein-rich ribosomes, and tRNAs that lack many of the conserved residues found in canonical tRNAs (5Fox T.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Helm M. Brule H. Friede D. Giege R. Putz D. Florentz C. RNA (N.

Despite these differences, mammalian mitochondria possess a translational elongation machinery with significant similarities to that of bacteria (8Spremulli L.L. Coursey A. Navratil T. Hunter S.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 211-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial EF-Tu (EF-Tumt) is highly conserved and is 55–60% identical to bacterial EF-Tu (9Woriax V.L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the EF-Tumt·GDP complex has been determined at 1.94-Å resolution (10Andersen G.R. Thirup S. Spremulli L.L. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The overall structure is similar to that observed in the Escherichia coli and Thermus aquaticus factors, but the nucleotide-binding domain (domain I) of EF-Tumt is in a different orientation relative to the rest of the structure compared with that observed in prokaryotic EF-Tu (11Polekhina G.

Leonard G. Phillips S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, domain III is followed by a short 11-amino acid extension that forms one helical turn. This extension seems to be specific to the mitochondrial factors and has not been observed in any of the prokaryotic factors. Bovine liver EF-Tsmt is 338 amino acids in length. The amino terminus of the mature protein has been determined and indicates that removal of the 55-residue import signal leaves a mature protein of 283 amino acids (13Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Bovine EF-Tsmt is only 25–35% identical to its bacterial homologs, and primary sequence alignments are a challenge due to the limited conservation observed between the mitochondrial and prokaryotic factors. Previous crystallographic studies have determined the structure of the EF-Tu·Ts complexes from E. coli and Thermus thermophilus (14Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 15Wang Y. Jiang Y. Meyering-Voss M. Sprinzl M. Sigler P.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The E. coli complex is a heterodimeric complex, whereas the T. thermophilus complex is heterotetrameric. In these complexes, EF-Ts makes extensive contacts with both domain I and domain III of EF-Tu. E. coli EF-Ts is organized into four structural modules (14Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar): the amino-terminal domain (residues 1–54), the core domain (residues 55–179 and 229–263), the dimerization or coiled-coil domain (residues 180–228), and the carboxyl-terminal module (residues 264–282). The core domain can be further divided into subdomain N (residues 55–140) and subdomain C (residues 141–179 and 229–263). The amino-terminal domain, subdomain N, and the carboxyl-terminal module interact with domain I of EF-Tu, whereas subdomain C interacts with domain III of EF-Tu. In the T. thermophilus (EF-Tu·Ts)2 complex, each EF-Tu moiety interacts with two EF-Ts subunits through a bipartite interface, which explains the need for an EF-Ts dimer in the nucleotide exchange reaction (15Wang Y. Jiang Y. Meyering-Voss M. Sprinzl M. Sigler P.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The mechanism of guanine nucleotide exchange in these factors is suggested to occur through a three-part mechanism. The interaction between EF-Tu and EF-Ts results in the disruption of the Mg2+ ion binding site, which leads to a reduced affinity of EF-Tu for guanine nucleotides. This process is induced by the intrusion of the side chains of Asp80 and Phe81 (E. coli numbering) from EF-Ts between helices B and C in domain I of EF-Tu. A peptide flip in the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) of EF-Tu destabilizes the binding of one β-phosphate oxygen of GDP. Finally, the movement of EF-Tu helix D affects the binding of the sugar and base of the bound nucleotide. The coordinated effects of this three-part mechanism lead to the release of GDP. In the current study, we present the crystal structure of the bovine EF-Tumt·Tsmt complex in the absence of any bound nucleotide at 2.2-Å resolution. The structure provides the first picture of the structure of the mitochondrial nucleotide exchange factor and provides insight into the mechanism of nucleotide exchange for this protein complex. Subcloning and Expression—The ligation independent cloning technique (Novagen) was used to remove the carboxyl-terminal His6 tag on mitochondrial Bos taurus EF-Tumt (9Woriax V.L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The plasmid was purified by the miniprep procedure (Qiagen) and used as a template for PCR amplification using forward primer 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGTGATAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGCTGTGGAGGCCAAGAAGACC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTAACTCCACTTGATGTTCTTGTCCTCC-3′. The sequence required for ligation independent cloning is shown in bold in both primers, the ribosomal entry site is underlined, and the start codon is shown in italics in the forward primer. A stop codon in the reverse primer is also shown in italics. The PCR product was inserted in the pET30 Ek/LIC vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). The annealed vector and insert were transformed into NovaBlue heat competent E. coli cells (Novagen). A clone containing the insert, determined by restriction enzyme digestion, was sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v.3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems), verifying the removal of the His6 tag. Isolated plasmids were then transformed into electrocompetent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for expression. Purification of Untagged SeMet Substituted EF-Tumt—The SeMet media consist of 1 μg/ml of vitamins (riboflavin, niacinamide, pyridoxine monohydrochloride, and thiamine), 40 μg/ml of all amino acids except methionine, 40 μg/ml SeMet, 25 μg/ml FeSO4, 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mg/ml NH4Cl, 6 mg/ml KH2PO4, and 25.6 mg/ml Na2HPO4·7H2O. All amino acids, vitamins, and glucose were filter sterilized through a 0.2-μm filter (Sartorius). The water and a 10× (NH4Cl/KH2PO4/Na2HPO4·7H2O) solution were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore) and autoclaved before mixing (16Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Instead of transforming the SeMet autotroph E. coli strain Bl21(DE3)834, the normal BL21(DE3) strain was used for the expression of SeMet protein. SeMet media (50 ml) containing kanamycin at 25 μg/ml were inoculated with E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing untagged B. taurus EF-Tumt and grown overnight at 37 °C. The cells were spun down and resuspended in 100 ml of fresh SeMet media, which were used to inoculate 1850 ml of SeMet media containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The cells grew at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.2–1.5, at which protein expression was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 8 h (also at 37 °C). The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 15 μm GDP, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.5 mm NaN3) per gram of wet cells and frozen at -20 °C. The cells were ruptured in an EmulsiFlex-05 high pressure cell homogenizer (Avestin) at ∼15,000 p.s.i. and ultracentrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 75 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Sartorius) and loaded on a 120-ml Source 30Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in lysis buffer. The protein was eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of 0–25% S30Q-B buffer (lysis buffer containing 1 m KCl). The flow rate was 2 ml/min, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing the protein of interest as determined by SDS-PAGE were pooled. The pooled protein was precipitated overnight with ∼70% (NH4)2SO4 and collected by low-speed centrifugation. The pelleted protein was resuspended in buffer HIC A (1.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 15 μm GDP, and 1 mm DTT). The pH of the buffer was adjusted to 7.5. A portion of the protein was loaded on a 1-ml ISO Resource column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in HIC A. The purity of EF-Tu in the flow-through fractions was close to 95% as assessed by SDS-PAGE, and no further purification was necessary. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated in a YM-30 Centricon tube (Amicon), glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%, and the sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Purification of EF-Tsmt—A single colony of cells expressing carboxylterminally His6-tagged EF-Tsmt (13Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was grown in 4 liters of LB media containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C while shaking until an A600 of 0.7–0.9 was reached. Protein expression was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3.5 h (also at 37 °C), and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. The wet cells were resuspended in EF-Tsmt lysis buffer (150 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 15 μm GDP, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm PMSF) to a total of 50 ml and stored at -20 °C. The thawed cells were broken using the EmulsiFlex-05 high pressure cell homogenizer (Avestin). The lysed cells were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 75 min at 4 °C. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to ∼8 with Tris-HCl and applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in EF-Tsmt lysis buffer. The column was washed with NH4Cl wash buffer (1 m NH4Cl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 15 μm GDP, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm PMSF) in order to minimize the fraction of EF-Tsmt that would otherwise be associated with the E. coli EF-Tu. The E. coli EF-Tu·EF-Tsmt complex was eluted with EF-Tsmt elution buffer (40 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 15 μm GDP, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm PMSF) containing 40 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 8. The remainder of the protein bound to the column was eluted with EF-Tsmt elution buffer containing 250 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 8. This latter portion contains mainly EF-Tsmt. The eluted portion containing EF-Tsmt was clarified in a tabletop centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C before being loaded on a 10-ml Source Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in EF-Tsmt Source Q Buffer A (40 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF). The protein was eluted with a gradient from 0% to 50% Source Q Buffer B (Source Q Buffer A containing 0.5 m KCl). Fractions containing EF-Tsmt were pooled and concentrated in a YM-10 Centricon tube (Amicon). Glycerol was added to the concentrated protein to a final concentration of 20%, and the sample was stored at -80 °C. Crystallization—Samples containing untagged SeMet substituted EF-Tumt and carboxyl-terminally His6-tagged EF-Tsmt were thawed on ice. The concentrations of both proteins were determined by the Bradford method (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The two proteins (∼5 mg of each) were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1.3 EF-Tumt·Tsmt and left on ice for approximately 1 h. The mixture was then dialyzed against 1.5 liters of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 8, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm NaN3 overnight and dialyzed the next morning for 2 h against a new 0.5 liter of the same buffer. The 1.5-ml sample was then clarified in a tabletop centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and applied to a 120-ml (2 × 60-cm) Sepharose S100 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer GF (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm NaN3). Fractions containing the complex were concentrated in a YM-50 Centricon tube (Amicon) to ∼6.5 mg/ml, and crystallization trials were set up. The SeMet substituted protein complex was crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution (14–18% PEG 8k, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm trisodium citrate·2H2O, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm NaN3) followed by equilibration against the reservoir at 6 °C. One day after setup, the drop was streak-seeded using native crystals. The crystals appeared within 1 day after this and grew to a maximum of 500 × 200 × 100 μm in 2–3 weeks. Data Collection and Processing—A crystal of SeMet substituted protein was transferred to stabilization buffer (20% (w/v) PEG 8k, 200 mm trisodium citrate·2H2O, 100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 10 mm DTT) and transferred 2 h later to cryobuffer (22% (w/v) PEG 8k, 200 mm trisodium citrate·2H2O, 100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). After 18 h in this buffer, the crystal was frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen gas at 100 K at the EMBL BW7a beamline at the DORIS storage ring, DESY (Hamburg, Germany). An x-ray fluorescence spectrum at the selenium K absorption edge was obtained by tuning the wavelength of the incident x-ray beam and used to determine the wavelengths necessary for subsequent data collection. A three-wavelength dataset was collected at the selenium peak (λ = 0.9818 Å), inflection point (λ = 0.9824 Å), and high energy remote (λ = 0.9716 Å), in that order. Data (360°) were collected for each wavelength, with 1° oscillation in each frame, but only 220° of data for each wave-length were used for structure determination. The data were processed with Denzo and Scalepack (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.S. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A, Methods in Enzymology Series. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to space group C2 and has cell dimensions a = 94.0 Å, b = 149.3 Å, c = 70.0 Å, and β = 125.2°. The asymmetric unit contains one EF-Tumt·Tsmt complex and has a solvent content of 52%. Structure Determination—MAD phase calculation using all three wavelengths and subsequent structure refinement were carried out in CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Eleven of 12 possible SeMet sites in EF-Tumt were successfully located. The MAD phases were used as MLHL restraints in the initial cycles of refinement to 2.5-Å resolution. The density-modified experimental three-wavelength electron density map calculated at 2.5Å was easily interpretable. Upon refining to 2.2 Å, the target was switched to MLF, and refinement was carried out against the remote data without anomalous contribution. Models were visualized in O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan Kjeldgaard. S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Residues 44–55 and 84–111 of EF-Tumt had no density initially and could not be modeled after refinement. Residues 112, 117–119, 225–228, 251–256, 295–298, 310–314, and 452 of EF-Tumt initially had badly defined density but could be built after refinement. The region of EF-Tumt containing residues 182–187 had bad density even after refinement indicated by their high B-factors. SeMet 375 of EF-Tumt was observed to have a double conformation and was refined accordingly in the last step of refinement. EF-Tsmt had poor density for residues 187–193 and no density for 330–338. During refinement, residues 187–193 and 330–331 were built. Residues 332–338 were the only ones that could not be built. A total of 322 water molecules were assigned to the asymmetric unit. The quality of the final model was inspected with PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the secondary structure was assigned with DSSP (22Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12414) Google Scholar). The final model, having been refined from 30.0 to 2.2 Å, has a Rwork = 21.8% and a Rfree = 24.7%. The root mean square deviation for bond lengths is 0.007 Å and 1.3° for bond angles. There are no outliers in the Ramachandran plot, and there are only 4 residues in the generously allowed region from a total of 645 residues. See Table I for data collection and refinement statistics. Fig. 1, A and B, and Figs. 4, 5, 6 were made with PyMOL (23DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar).Fig. 1A, cartoon representation of the bovine EF-Tumt·Tsmt complex. EF-Tumt is colored orange, and EF-Tsmt is colored violet (amino-terminal domain), green (subdomain N), and blue (subdomain C). The amino terminus and carboxyl terminus of both proteins are labeled along with domain I, II, and III and helices B, C, and D of EF-Tumt and the secondary structure elements of EF-Tsmt.

The loop following the NKXD motif in EF-Tumt is in a distinct conformation after complex formation with EF-Tsmt. The P-loop, as in other G-protein·nucleotide exchange factor complexes, is seen to have a different conformation due to a peptide flip in this loop.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overall Structure—The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains one heterodimeric complex of EF-Tumt·Tsmt, and 322 water molecules could be modeled. The overall structure of the complex (Fig. 1A) is similar to that of the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex (14Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As in the E. coli complex, the amino-terminal domain and subdomain N of EF-Tsmt contact domain I of EF-Tumt, whereas subdomain C interacts with domain III. The buried surface area, when considering these contacts, constitutes 3140 Å2 in the mitochondrial complex compared with 2623 Å2 in the E. coli complex. When also considering the contacts made between domain I and the carboxyl-terminal module in the E. coli complex, the buried surface area in this complex is 3624 Å2. This kind of interaction is not observed in the mitochondrial complex because EF-Tsmt is shorter than E. coli EF-Ts and the last 7 residues could not be modeled in the mitochondrial protein. EF-Tsmt—The structure of EF-Ts is known for both the E. coli and T. thermophilus factors (14Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature"
https://openalex.org/W2057571164,We present spectroscopic evidence consistent with the presence of a stable tyrosyl radical in partially reduced human monoamine oxidase (MAO) A. The radical forms following single electron donation to MAO A and exists in equilibrium with the FAD flavosemiquinone. Oxidative formation of the tyrosyl radical in MAO is not reliant on neighboring metal centers and uniquely requires reduction of the active site flavin to facilitate oxidation of a tyrosyl side chain. The identified tyrosyl radical provides the key missing link in support of the single electron transfer mechanism for amine oxidation by MAO enzymes.
https://openalex.org/W1991057699,"The variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of African trypanosomes has a structural role in protecting other cell surface proteins from effector molecules of the mammalian immune system and also undergoes antigenic variation necessary for a persistent infection in a host. Here we have reported the solution structure of a VSG type 2 C-terminal domain from MITat1.2, completing the first structure of both domains of a VSG. The isolated C-terminal domain is a monomer in solution and forms a novel fold, which commences with a short α-helix followed by a single turn of 310-helix and connected by a short loop to a small anti-parallel β-sheet and then a longer α-helix at the C terminus. This compact domain is flanked by two unstructured regions. The structured part of the domain contains 42 residues, and the core comprises 2 disulfide bonds and 2 hydrophobic residues. These cysteines and hydrophobic residues are conserved in other VSGs, and we have modeled the structures of two further VSG C-terminal domains using the structure of MITat1.2. The models suggest that the overall structure of the core is conserved in the different VSGs but that the C-terminal α-helix is of variable length and depends on the presence of charged residues. The results provided evidence for a conserved tertiary structure for all the type 2 VSG C-terminal domains, indicated that VSG dimers form through interactions between N-terminal domains, and showed that the selection pressure for sequence variation within a conserved tertiary structure acts on the whole of the VSG molecule.

African trypanosomes have evolved a complex system of antigenic variation that facilitates the long term survival of a population in a mammalian host (see Ref. 1McCulloch R. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 117-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar for a recent review).

The VSG is also the mediator of antigenic variation. At any time, only a single VSG gene is expressed, and antigenic variation results from a low frequency, stochastic event that causes a switch to the expression of a different VSG gene. During the course of an infection, there are successive clonal expansions of trypanosomes, each expressing an antigenically novel VSG. In Trypanosoma brucei and the closely related species T. evansi and T. equiperdum, each VSG monomer has a molecular mass of 45–55 kDa and is made up of two or three domains (2Johnson J.G.

Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The VSG N-terminal domain has 350–400 residues, which are followed by one or two C-terminal domains of 30–70 residues each. Less is known about T. congolense and T. vivax VSGs; they are somewhat smaller, 45–50 kDa, and have a single domain that is similar to the T. brucei VSG N-terminal domain (4Bussler H. Linder M.

It is believed that the conservation of structure is necessary for the protective function of the VSG, although this has not been proven. The N-terminal domain of VSG MITat1.2 (9Freymann D. Down J. Carrington M. Roditi I. Turner M. Wiley D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 141-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) is elongated and is composed of seven α-helices, which comprise about 47% of the structure. Two major α-helices, each of ∼70 Å, form a coiled coil that acts as a scaffold for the remaining smaller helices and loops. The structure of VSG ILTat1.24 (10Blum M.L. Down J.A. Gurnett A.M. Carrington M. Turner M.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) is homologous to that of MITat1.2. Although the structural identity is 60%, the sequences are only 16% identical over the same residues. This striking conservation of structure is likely to be present in other VSGs (4Bussler H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7272-7278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The function of the VSG C-terminal domain remains obscure; it is possible that it elongates the VSG, resulting in a thicker surface coat, but this function is clearly not essential as neither T. congolense nor T. vivax VSGs contains an obvious equivalent of this domain. There is no obvious similarity between the VSG C-terminal domain sequence and any other protein, with the possible exception of an extracellular domain present in hexose transporters from trypanosomes and related species (13Carrington M. Boothroyd J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains from T. brucei-like VSGs are related to one another but can be split into four types based on sequence homology (3Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I. Wiley D. Turner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the structure of VSG MITat1.2, the N-terminal domain ends with an α-helix (helix S) which is followed by a single type 2 C-terminal domain in the native VSG. Type 2 C-terminal domains are characterized by 4 conserved cysteine residues. A similar arrangement of cysteines is present in type 1 C-terminal domains, where they are disulfide-bonded in a 1 to 3 and 2 to 4 pattern (15Allen G. Gurnett L.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When different type 2 C-terminal domains are compared, there is little sequence conservation other than the cysteines, a conserved hydrophobic (often aromatic) residue after the third cysteine and an N-linked glycosylation site very close to the C terminus (Fig. 1). Progress in understanding the mechanism by which the VSG monolayer protects the trypanosome cell surface is largely dependent upon improving our knowledge of the complete structure of the VSG. This goal has been hindered by difficulties in obtaining high quality crystals of a complete VSG (16Down J. Garman S. Gurnett A. Turner M. Wiley D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17.Garman, S. C. (1994) The X-ray Crystallographic Analysis of an Intact VSG from the Trypanosome. Ph.D. thesis, Harvard University, Cambridge, MassachusettsGoogle Scholar). Here, we have reported the solution structure of the type 2 C-terminal domain from VSG MITat1.2 and thus the completion of the first structure of both domains of a VSG. The C-terminal domain has a novel structure and forms a compact fold of 42 residues, with a core comprised of 2 disulfide bonds and 2 conserved hydrophobic residues. Other divergent type 2 C-terminal domains have been modeled using the structure, indicating that the conservation of tertiary structure against a background of sequence variation is likely to be present in the VSG C-terminal domain as well as in the VSG N-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain structure has been used to produce a model of the VSG on the trypanosome cell surface that is consistent with a role for the C-terminal domain in the diffusion barrier function of the VSG. Protein Expression and Purification—A construct designed to express residues 359–433 of mature VSG MITat1.2 (EMBL X56762) was cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pET15b. The polypeptide was expressed either in Escherichia coli AD494(DE3) or in E. coli BL21trxB(DE3) in a minimal medium based on MOPS buffer, containing 5% 15N-labeled Celtone and [15N]ammonium chloride or 5% [13C,15N]Celtone, [15N]ammonium chloride, and [13C]glucose (Spectra Stable Isotopes). The C-terminal domain (M1.2C) was purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+ column followed by digestion with thrombin to remove the N-terminal His tag. After thrombin cleavage, 5 residues (GSHML) from the vector remained at the N terminus. M1.2C was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 30 column (Amersham Biosciences), followed by reverse-phase HPLC using a 25 × 1-cm Hichrom-5 C8 column and a 0–20% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The presence of free sulfhydryls in M1.2C was measured using the Ellman assay (18Sedlak J. Lindsay R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (6497) Google Scholar) by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate). The relative molecular mass of M1.2C was determined by electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Equilibrium sedimentation analysis was performed in a Beckman XL-I ultracentrifuge. Three two-sector cells were filled with 100 μl of 29, 30, or 37 μm M1.2C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 150 mm NaCl; 110 μl of the same buffer was used on the reference side of each cell. The cells were placed in an An50-Ti rotor. For each sample, the equilibrium concentration gradients were measured for angular velocities of 25000, 33000, and 40000 rpm. Concentrations were measured as the absorbance at 280 nm (and using the Raleigh interference optics). The measured data were analyzed by global fitting using the program WinNonlin (19Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The nine data sets were fitted simultaneously, with the molecular mass as a global parameter and with two local parameters for each (the concentration at the reference position and the baseline offset). The solvent density used was 1.01099 g/ml at 5 °C, and the protein partial specific volume at 5 °C was 0.6998 ml/g. Both values were calculated using Sednterp (T. Laue, University of New Hampshire). An extinction coefficient for the protein of 9098 m-1 cm-1 was obtained using amino acid analysis. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed using [15N]- and [13C,15N]-labeled samples of 0.7–1.0 mm M1.2C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 10% D2O. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C on Bruker DRX 500 and DRX 600 spectrometers. The experiments recorded were 15N HSQC, 15N-separated NOESY (150 ms mixing time), 15N-separated TOCSY (67.9 ms DIPSI mixing), HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, HBHA(CBCACO)NH, (H)CC(CO)NH-TOCSY (14.3 ms mixing time), 13C HSQC, and 13C-separated NOESY (150 ms mixing time). TALOS (20Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar) was used to estimate backbone torsion angles based on the CA, CO, CB, N, and HA chemical shifts. CLEANEX (21Hwang T.L. van Zijl P.C.M. Mori S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) experiments were recorded to analyze solvent exchange rates and deduce hydrogen bonding information. Backbone dynamics were assessed using a heteronuclear NOE experiment (22Farrow N.A. Zhang O.W. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 868-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Spectra were processed using the program AZARA (W. Boucher, University of Cambridge) and analyzed with ANSIG (23Kraulis P.J. Dommaile P.J. Campbell-Burk S.L. Aken T.V. Laue E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3515-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Structure calculations were performed using ARIA (24Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.J. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) interfaced to CNS 1.0 (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

The structures were calculated with 90 ps of high temperature dynamics and 30 ps of cooling from 10,000 to 1,000 K in torsion angle space. This was followed by 24 ps of cooling from 1,000 to 50 K using dynamics in Cartesian space. Figs. 3, 5, and 6 were produced using Molscript (26Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

The sequence alignment shown in Fig. 1 was used as the input for MODELLER (28Marti-Renom M. Stuart A. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). The model with the lowest MODELLER objective function was used for subsequent analysis after the stereochemistry was checked using PROCHECK (29Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Docking—The whole VSG structure was docked using the program 3D-Dock (30Moont G. Gabb H.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain dimer from MITat1.2 (Protein Data Bank code 1VSG) was docked with the core structure of the C-terminal domain (residues 375–416) on the basis of surface complementarity, and the resulting structures were then ranked on the basis of an empirical pair potential matrix (30Moont G. Gabb H.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Purification of the MITat1.2 C-terminal Domain—A construct was designed to express a polypeptide containing the MITat1.2 C-terminal domain plus a short overlap with the N-terminal domain. The polypeptide (M1.2C) started at Glu-359, which is within helix S of the N-terminal domain (9Freymann D. Down J. Carrington M. Roditi I. Turner M. Wiley D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 141-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and ended at the mature C terminus, Ser-433. M1.2C was expressed in E. coli AD494(DE3) and E. coli BL21trxB(DE3); both strains carry a mutation in the trxB gene that allows the formation of protein disulfide bonds in the E. coli cytoplasm. M1.2C prepared from these strains contained no free sulfhydryl groups as determined by reaction with 5′,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). After thrombin cleavage, a relative molecular mass of 8730.61 ± 0.35 was determined by electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry, in agreement with the expected mass of 8730.4 for fully disulfide-bonded M1.2C. Two-dimensional 1H TOCSY and NOESY experiments were recorded on unlabeled material that had been expressed in E. coli AD494(DE3). Some of the resonances in these spectra were accompanied by a second, weaker peak of about one-tenth the intensity. We concluded that these shadow cross-peaks were due to an alternative disulfide-bonded form of M1.2C because: (i) the electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry data indicated a homogeneous polypeptide of the expected mass, (ii) no free sulfhydryl groups were detected, and (iii) M1.2C appeared homogeneous by reducing SDS-PAGE but migrated as two close but distinct bands on non-reducing SDS-PAGE at a similar relative intensity to the two sets of resonances observed in the NMR spectra (data not shown). In subsequent experiments, the ratio of the two forms varied with the E. coli host strain, growth medium, and temperature of expression. The isotopically labeled samples were produced in E. coli BL21trxB(DE3), and it was necessary to purify the major form using reverse-phase HPLC. After HPLC purification, the intensity ratio of the resonances in a 15N HSQC spectrum was 11:1. M1.2C Is a Monomer in Solution—VSGs are dimeric, and the N-terminal domain contains a large dimerization interface that buries ∼8,000 Å2 (9Freymann D. Down J. Carrington M. Roditi I. Turner M. Wiley D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 141-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Equilibrium sedimentation analysis was used to determine whether the C-terminal domain is also a dimer (Fig. 2). The best fit of the model to the data gave a molecular mass of 8795 g/mol. When compared with the mass calculated from the amino acid composition of 8730.4 g/mol, it can be seen that M1.2C is a monomer in solution under the conditions used. The highest concentration used was 37 μm, so the Kd for any dimer formation would be >0.5 mm. Three-dimensional Structure of M1.2C—Backbone resonances were assigned from HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments using standard triple resonance techniques. Side chain assignments were completed using the 15N TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY, HBHA(CBCACO)NH, and (H)C-C(CO)NH-TOCSY experiments. Assignment of NOEs was based on the 15N-separated NOESY (502 unambiguous, 100 ambiguous NOEs) and 13C-separated NOESY (509 unambiguous, 65 ambiguous NOEs). These NOEs were translated by ARIA into 719 unambiguous and 121 ambiguous, non-degenerate distance restraints. 24 pairs of dihedral restraints were derived from the backbone chemical shifts using TALOS-based predictions. 20 slowly exchanging amides were identified in the CLEANEX experiment, which were translated into hydrogen bond restraints within the secondary structure by manual inspection of structures generated by early rounds of structure calculations. The hydrogen bonds were treated as unambiguous NOEs, with distance restraints of 2.3 Å (O to H) and 3.3 Å (O to N). At the end of 8 iterations, there were 772 unambiguous and 97 ambiguous NOE-derived distance restraints. In the final iteration, 100 structures were calculated and the 50 lowest energy structures were used for further analysis. The NMR data defined a structured core with unstructured residues at both the N and C termini. The structured part of M1.2C contained 42 residues from Ala-375 to Asp-416 (Fig. 3 and Table I). Each residue in this core region has a positive value for the heteronuclear NOE (Fig. 4). Outside the structured core, no long range distance restraints were observed for residues from Glu-359 to Ala-374 or from Glu-417 to Ser-433. The heteronuclear NOE values for these residues were less than 0.1 (Fig. 4), indicating that they are disordered in solution.Table IExperimental restraints and structural statisticsNumber of experimental restraintsUnambiguous772Ambiguous97Dihedral restraints48Hydrogen bonds40〈SA〉a〈SA〉 represents the average root mean square deviations for the ensemble〈SA〉cb〈SA〉c represents values for the structure that is closest to the meanCoordinate precisionRoot mean square deviations of backbone atoms (375-416) (Å)0.65 ± 0.170.33Root mean square deviations of heavy atoms (375-416) (Å)1.19 ± 0.170.92Root mean square deviationsFrom the experimental restraintsNOE distances (Å)0.033 ± 0.00330.034Dihedral angles (°)0.35 ± 0.290.10From idealized geometryBonds (Å)0.0040 ± 0.000150.0041Angles (°)0.536 ± 0.0200.540Impropers (°)1.56 ± 0.1221.410Final energyEL-JcThe Lennard-Jones potential was not used at any stage in the refinement (kJ/mol)-495.99 ± 8.85-517.01Ramachandran analysis (375-416)Residues in most favoured regions79.3%80.0%Residues in additionally allowed regions15.5%12.5%Residues in generously allowed regions2.3%2.5%Residues in disallowed regions2.8%5.0%a 〈SA〉 represents the average root mean square deviations for the ensembleb 〈SA〉c represents values for the structure that is closest to the meanc The Lennard-Jones potential was not used at any stage in the refinement Open table in a new tab The initial structure calculations were performed with no disulfide restraints to attempt to determine the disulfide-bonding pattern by determining the distances between the S atoms in the cysteine residues (data not shown). This approach was inconclusive as all 4 cysteine residues were clustered together in the core (Figs. 3 and 5). The disulfide bonding pattern was subsequently elucidated by the identification of a strong NOE between the Hβ of Cys-381 and Cys-393. This translates to a Cβ–Cβ interatomic distance of 3.497 Å in the structure closest to the mean, a value close to the canonical distance for two cysteines linked by a disulfide bond (31Klaus W. Broger C. Gerber P. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). No NOEs were observed between Cys-389 and Cys-404; their absence may be due to conformational exchange that leads to line broadening, as the backbone amide resonance of Cys-404 could not be observed in any NMR spectra. Interestingly, however, Cys-389 NH is observed and its heteronuclear NOE is typical of a structured residue. As there are no free thiols in the monomeric M1.2C and the relative molecular mass corresponds to the expected value for the fully disulfide-bonded form, Cys-389 and Cys-404 must also be forming a disulfide bond. Thus, M1.2C has a disulfide bonding pattern of 1 to 3 and 2 to 4, the same as that present in VSG type 1 C-terminal domains (15Allen G. Gurnett L.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of M1.2C (Fig. 2) begins with a short α-helix between residues Glu-378 and Lys-383. This is followed by a single turn of 310-helix between residues Gln-386 and Glu-388, which is connected by a short loop to the first strand of the β-sheet from Cys-393 to His-396. The two short strands of the β-sheet result in a typical network of interstrand NOEs and hydrogen bonds. The second strand of the β-sheet runs from Lys-403 to Leu-406 and leads to a longer α-helix stretching from Lys-408 to Asp-416. As well as the usual intrahelix NOE pattern, this terminal α-helix has a limited number of long range NOEs to the rest of the core region, in agreement with the lower heteronuclear NOE values for this region (Fig. 4). The loop, Asn-397 to Lys-402, connecting the two β-strands is not well defined (at the top of the structure in Fig. 3) with the heteronuclear NOE values ranging between 0.3 and 0.6, lower than for most of the structured core (Fig. 4). The line widths of the resonances corresponding to residues within this loop were also larger than the average line width in the core, implying that there is motion on the millisecond time scale within this region. The heteronuclear NOE values for the C-terminal α-helix (Lys-408 to Asp-416) are positive but decrease toward the terminus, suggesting that there is an increase in the amplitude of helix motion. The majority of residues in the α-helix are charged (Fig. 1), and it appears to be stabilized by a number of salt bridges (Fig. 5) both within the helix and between the helix and the rest of the domain. In the middle of the helix, Lys-412 makes a salt bridge with Asp-416 and Lys-413 is sandwiched between Glu-409 and Glu-417. The spacing between these residues conforms to the i, i+4 pattern that has been observed to stabilize isolated α-helices (32Lyu P.C. Gans P.J. Kallenbach N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Two sets of ionic interactions between the C-terminal α-helix and other residues in the structured core pin the N terminus of the helix to the rest of the core: Lys-394 in the first β-strand interacts with Asp-407 and Glu-410, whereas Glu-378 in the first α-helix interacts with Lys-408 (Fig. 5). The 4 cysteines in M1.2C lie buried in the core of the structure (Fig. 5). The remainder of the core is composed of 2 hydrophobic residues that flank the disulfide bonds, Trp-395 and Leu-406. These residues, as well as the cysteines, are conserved in many VSG type 2 C-terminal domains (Fig. 1); in other type 2 C-terminal domains hydrophobic residues are usually found at an equivalent location in the sequence. Most of the remainder of the domain is made up of small polar and charged residues, with the exception of Pro-392, which also makes hydrophobic contacts with Ala-411 and Val-414 in the C-terminal helix. None of these 3 residues is conserved in type 2 C-terminal domains. The importance of the cysteines for the structural integrity of M1.2C was tested by making mutants in which the cysteines were changed to alanines. Three mutants were made: (i) C381A and C393A, (ii) C389A and C404A, and (iii) all four cysteines mutated to alanine. The proteins were expressed, purified, and preliminary 1H NMR spectra collected. The spectra of all three mutants showed considerably less dispersion of resonances (data not show"
https://openalex.org/W2015548961,"The biosynthesis of membrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) involves the integration of the polypeptide at the Sec61 translocon together with a number of maturation events, such as N-glycosylation and signal sequence cleavage, that can occur both during and after synthesis. To better understand the events occurring after the release of the nascent chain from the ER translocon, we investigated the ER components adjacent to the transmembrane-spanning domain of a well characterized fragment of the amyloid precursor protein. Using individual cysteine residues as site-specific cross-linking targets, we found that several ER components can be cross-linked to the fully integrated polypeptide. We identified strong adducts with both the ribophorin I subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex and the 25-kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex. Focusing on the association with ribophorin I, we found that adduct formation occurred exclusively after the exit of the nascent chain from the Sec61 translocon and was unaffected by the N-glycosylation status of the associated precursor. Only a subset of newly made membrane proteins associated with ribophorin I in vitro, and we could recapitulate a specific association between the amyloid precursor protein fragment and ribophorin I in vivo.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). More recently, the transmembrane (TM) domains of tail-anchored and signal-anchored proteins were found to be transiently adjacent to the SPC25 subunit following membrane insertion, consistent with the SPC scanning hydrophobic transmembrane regions for adjacent cleavage sites as they exit the Sec61 complex (5Abell B.M.

The OST mediates the transfer of high mannose oligosaccharides from a dolichol carrier to suitable -Asn-X-(Thr/Ser)-acceptor sites in nascent chains (6Kelleher D.J. Karaoglu D. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have shown that the mammalian OST is closely associated with the ER translocon (7Nikonov A.V. Snapp E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), consistent with the addition of N-linked glycans during and immediately after translocation. Biochemical studies have built upon the well defined yeast OST complex to show that its mammalian equivalent has different isoforms that contain several distinct subunits, namely ribophorin I, ribophorin II, OST48, Dad1, one of either STT3A or STT3B, and a loosely associated mammalian equivalent of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae OST3p/OST6p subunits (6Kelleher D.J. Karaoglu D. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A major breakthrough in our understanding of OST function has been compelling evidence that the STT3 subunit recognizes consensus sites for N-glycosylation and most likely provides the catalytic center of the OST mediating glycosylation of polypeptide chains (8Nilsson I.

Wren B.W. Aebi M. Science. 2002; 298: 1790-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In the first study to link ribophorin I with the N-glycosylation at the ER, it was suggested that its transmembrane domain might function as a dolichol binding site (11Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and thereby act to bring the lipid-linked high mannose form of the glycan in close proximity to the OST complex and any potential protein substrates. More recent studies indicated that ribophorin I may form all or part of the active site of the OST complex (12Bause E. Wesemann M. Bartoschek A. Breuer W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Yan Q. Prestwich G.D. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5021-5025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although it seems more likely this function is mediated by STT3, and hence the precise role of ribophorin I and the other subunits of the OST remains unclear (8Nilsson I. Kelleher D.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Kreibich G. von Gilmore R. Heijne G. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 9Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol.

In this study, we extended our previous analysis of membrane protein biosynthesis at the ER (5Abell B.M. Jung M. Oliver J.D. Knight B.C. Tyedmers J. Zimmermann R. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5669-5678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14High S. Andersen S.S. Görlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. J.

Cell. 2002; 13: 4114-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to include a simple, single spanning membrane protein that has an atypical fate within the cell. During the maturation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), specific proteolytic cleavage events generate peptides that are strongly implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (16Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11039-11041Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this case, we used the biologically relevant APP-C99 fragment as a model to study membrane protein integration and maturation in vitro. APP-C99 is generated in vivo by the β-secretase (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme)-mediated proteolytic cleavage of full-length APP, and it is this fragment that is the substrate for the γ-secretase, which cleaves it within its transmembrane region to generate the Aβ peptides that are a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (17Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro system combined with cysteine-mediated site-specific cross-linking, we investigated the ER components that are associated with APP-C99′, a derivative of APP-C99 with a 2-amino acid N-terminal extension, during both its membrane integration and subsequent maturation (see Fig. 1A). A preliminary scanning approach showed that this model protein is cross-linked to distinct subsets of ER components dependent upon the location of the cysteine probe within the nascent polypeptide. Among these various adducts, strong cross-linking from a cysteine located on the cytosolic side of the TM to ribophorin I and SPC25 was observed. The association of newly synthesized membrane proteins with these components was concomitant with their lateral exit from the Sec61 translocon, and we speculate that ribophorin I may act to maintain potential substrates in close proximity to STT3, the presumptive catalytic subunit of the OST. Alternatively ribophorin I may facilitate other ER-associated processes such as quality control.Fig. 2Site-specific cross-linking of APP-C99′ polypeptides. The schematics show the membrane topology of APP-C99′ after signal sequence cleavage and indicate the approximate location of the four cysteine residues (black circles) used as site-specific probes; numbering in brackets shows the location of the single cysteine probe in the mature APP-C99′ chain. APP-C99′[Cys25](lanes 1–4), APP-C99′[Cys40](lanes 5–8), APP-C99′[Cys49](lanes 9–12), and APP-C99′[Cys59](lanes 13–16) were synthesized as radiolabeled polypeptides using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes. By using encoding mRNAs that lacked a stop codon these polypeptides could remain associated with the ribosome as peptidyl-tRNA species and hence become trapped at the ER translocon in the form of artificial integration intermediates (15Meacock S.L. Lecomte F.J. Crawshaw S.G. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4114-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Laird V. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1983-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated integration intermediates were recovered from the reaction mixture by centrifugation through a high salt/sucrose cushion, and the resulting samples were then treated with 50 μm BMH (+) or an equivalent Me2SO solvent control (–) either before (0 min) or after (10 min) incubation with puromycin (Puro) to release any trapped nascent chains from the ribosome. The location of the various APP-C99′ nascent chains is shown (NC), and various BMH-dependent adducts are indicated (filled circles and asterisks).

A, following targeting to the ER, the nascent polypeptide chain is inserted into the translocon, and the signal peptide (SP) is cleaved by the SPC. The protein can be artificially trapped at the translocon as a ribosome-bound integration intermediate (23Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or released from the ribosome by puromycin treatment to allow complete insertion and the potential association of the newly made protein with post-translocon components of the ER (indicated by?). B, the amino acid sequence of the APP-C99′ precursor consists of the signal sequence from bovine preprolactin (bold), 2 residues of the mature prolactin sequence (italics) that will remain after signal sequence cleavage as indicated by an arrow (cf. Ref. 18Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Masters C. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the predicted transmembrane domain (underlined). Four versions of APP-C99′ with residues 25, 40, 49, and 59 of the mature sequence altered to a cysteine (bold italics) were generated for use in cross-linking experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Materials—General chemicals and reagents were obtained from Merck or Sigma, bismaleimidohexane (BMH) was from Prochem (Rockford, IL), and octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8) was from Fluka (Gillingham, UK). All sera are rabbit polyclonal unless otherwise stated. Those recognizing ribophorin II, DadI, and OST48 were made to order by Invitrogen, and those recognizing SPC25 and APP-C99 (C terminus) were made by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Antisera specific for Sec61α, Sec61β, and ribophorin I were gifts from R. Zimmerman (University of the Saarland, Homburg, Germany), B. Dobberstein (Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie der Universität Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany), and I. Ivessa (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria), respectively. Antisera recognizing the ribosomal proteins L23a and L35 were a gift from M. Pool (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK). The WO2 mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the N terminus of APP-C99 was kindly provided by M. Shearman and D. Beher (Merck Sharp Dohme, Harlow, UK). cDNA Constructs—The wild type signal peptide present on the SPA4CT derivative of APP (18Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Masters C. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was exchanged for a variant from bovine preprolactin where the cysteine at residue 25 of the wild type signal sequence was altered to a glycine. The final coding region of the new plasmid (pSP65/PPLA4CT) was for a 131-amino acid precursor with a 30-amino acid cleavable signal sequence (Fig. 1B, bold). It should be noted that the first two residues of the mature prolactin sequence (Fig. 1B, italics) were retained to facilitate authentic cleavage of the signal sequence giving an APP-C99′ fragment with a 2-amino acid N-terminal extension similar to that previously characterized by Dyrks et al. (18Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Masters C. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that had a different 2-residue N-terminal extension after signal sequence cleavage. The version of APP-C99 used in this study will therefore be referred to as APP-C99′ to distinguish it from its progenitor. Single cysteine mutants of APP-C99′ were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) to alter the following residues: Asp25, Gly40, Ile49, and Tyr59 (cf. Figs. 1B and 2). In the case of the opsin-derived polypeptides, the mRNA for OP91/TM1HA[Cys65] was produced by PCR from a bovine opsin cDNA as described previously (15Meacock S.L. Lecomte F.J. Crawshaw S.G. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4114-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using an opsin variant with a single cysteine substitution at residue 65 and a reverse primer that incorporated a 9-residue HA tag at the C terminus of the resulting product. OP95/TM5HA was created by combining residues 1–35 and 195–246 of bovine opsin and substituting a single cysteine at residue 70 of the resulting coding region. A 9-residue C-terminal HA tag was subsequently introduced by PCR during the preparation of the DNA template for transcription. Transcription—DNA templates for the in vitro transcription of mRNAs lacking a stop codon were generated by PCR using appropriate primers as described previously (19Laird V. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1983-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All resulting PCR products were treated with DpnI (100 units/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C to remove any methylated parental plasmid DNA prior to transcription with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK). All RNA transcripts were purified with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) before use in translation reactions. Translation and Cross-linking—A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes (20Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 1.5–2.0 A280/ml as an ER membrane source, was used for protein synthesis. Unless otherwise stated, incubations were performed at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence of [35S]methionine (0.82 μCi/μl) and 50 mm ascorbic acid to reduce the formation of nonspecific background adducts via radical formation (21Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Hartmann T. Masters C. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18210-18217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Aurintricarboxylic acid was then added to a final concentration of 100 μm to inhibit further initiation, and the incubation continued for another 10 min at 30 °C. Translation was then terminated by the addition of cycloheximide to 2 mm to stabilize ribosome bound integration intermediates or of puromycin and EDTA to 2 and 50 mm, respectively, to release the nascent chains from the ribosome. Samples were then placed on ice immediately (5Abell B.M. Jung M. Oliver J.D. Knight B.C. Tyedmers J. Zimmermann R. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5669-5678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or incubated for a further 10 min at 30 °C. Membrane-associated intermediates were isolated by centrifugation through a high salt/sucrose cushion (250 mm sucrose, 500 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9) at 130,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in a low salt/sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min either in the presence of the cysteine-reactive irreversible cross-linking reagent BMH at 50 μm or an equivalent dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) solvent control. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to 10 mm and left for 10 min on ice, samples were then either analyzed directly or following immunoprecipitation in the presence of SDS as described previously (5Abell B.M. Jung M. Oliver J.D. Knight B.C. Tyedmers J. Zimmermann R. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5669-5678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All samples were treated with RNase A (7 μg/translation reaction) to remove any tRNA that remained attached to the stalled polypeptide chains prior to SDS-PAGE (23Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Isolation of Ribosomal Subunits—Membrane-associated translation products were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) C12E8 detergent, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; layered over a sucrose cushion (250 mm sucrose, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9 with 0.1% (w/v) C12E8), and centrifuged at 213,000 × g for 20 min to pellet ribosomal subunits and associated products. The location of ribosomal subunits was confirmed by immunoblotting using primary antisera recognizing the ribosomal proteins L23a and L35 in combination with the Western Lightning system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sucrose Gradient Analysis—Following in vitro translation and puromycin treatment, membrane fractions were isolated and treated with 50 μm BMH as described above. The membrane fraction was then reisolated by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and solubilized in 0.5 ml of gradient buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) C12E8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The resulting material was clarified by centrifugation at ∼13,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was layered onto a 10-ml 5–25% (w/v) sucrose gradient (in gradient buffer) poured over a 0.5-ml 50% (w/v) sucrose cushion, and components were resolved by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 1-ml fractions were removed carefully from the gradient, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and/or immunoblotting. Transient Expression and Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% non-essential amino acids and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were transfected with a C-terminally HA-tagged version of APP-C99′[Cys59] cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1, denoted APP-C99′[Cys59]HA, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen); harvested 18 h after transfection; rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline; and lysed in 1% C12E8 immunoprecipitation buffer (1% (w/v) C12E8, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 h on ice. The sample was centrifuged at ∼13,000 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei and non-solubilized material, the supernatant was removed, and APP-C99′[Cys59]HA was recovered by immunoprecipitation using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitated material together with a sample of the input lysate (one-tenth) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the resulting gels were analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for APP-C99, ribophorin I, or SPC25 as indicated. Sample Analysis—All samples were analyzed on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels except those shown in Figs. 3, A and B (12%), and Fig. 6C (10%). The resulting gels were dried and then visualized using a Fuji BAS 1800 PhosphorImager system (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Molecular Interactions of Newly Synthesized APP-C99—The primary aim of this study was to investigate the biosynthesis and maturation of a simple single spanning membrane protein and to analyze the ER proteins in close proximity to its TM domain after integration was complete (see Fig. 1A). For this purpose, we selected a well characterized C-terminal domain of APP, the APP-C99 polypeptide, as a useful model for studying this process in vitro. This fragment is of biological significance since it is equivalent to the region of APP that is generated in vivo by the action of the β-secretase, and both this cleavage product and its artificially generated counterpart are potential substrates for additional cleavage by the γ-secretase (24Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Monning U. Urmoneit B. Turner J. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has been shown that when the N-terminal signal peptide of APP is fused to the APP-C99 fragment the resulting precursor is targeted to the ER and membrane-integrated in vitro (18Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Masters C. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, our own preliminary studies indicated that the in vitro targeting of APP-C99 may be relatively inefficient (data not shown). To increase the targeting and membrane insertion of APP-C99 and thereby improve the potential for adduct formation upon cross-linking, we exchanged the APP-derived signal sequence (18Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Masters C. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for the signal peptide from bovine preprolactin, a secretory protein that has previously been shown to be efficiently imported into the ER (4Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). With this new APP derivative, denoted APP-C99′ (see Fig. 1B), we observed efficient and reproducible membrane integration and signal sequence cleavage when the encoding mRNA was translated in the presence of microsomes (data not shown). A second advantage of the APP-C99 fragment is that it lacks any endogenous cysteines, making it an ideal starting point for the introduction of single cysteine residues for use as site-specific cross-linking probes (5Abell B.M. Jung M. Oliver J.D. Knight B.C. Tyedmers J. Zimmermann R. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5669-5678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Meacock S.L. Lecomte F.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1983-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The wild type preprolactin signal sequence contains a single cysteine residue, and to avoid any cross-linking to ER components from this location either before or after cleavage from the APP-derived polypeptide (4Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), this residue was altered to a glycine. Using this APP-C99 derivative (denoted APP-C99′) as a starting point, single cysteine residues were then introduced at four different locations within and flanking the TM region (see Fig. 2). These proteins were then synthesized as ribosome-bound integration intermediates at the ER membrane and subjected to cysteine-specific cross-linking with BMH either before or after a 10-min puromycin treatment to release the chains from the ribosome. In each case, discrete BMH-dependent adducts could be seen with the probes at residues 49 and 59 appearing to generate the most adducts (see Fig. 2). Of particular note was the observation that several adducts appeared to remain after the puromycin-dependent release of the nascent chain from the ribosome (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 4, 11, 12, 15, and 16, filled circles and asterisks). In each case, some higher molecular weight products could be seen in the absence of BMH treatment. These most likely represent a combination of peptidyl-tRNA species (25Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10587-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), in vitro ubiquitination of the APP-C99′ chain (26Abell B.M. Pool M.R. Schlenker O. Sinning I. High S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2755-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and radical-mediated adduct formation that can occur in the reticulocyte system (21Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Hartmann T. Masters C. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18210-18217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nevertheless it was clear that discrete BMH-dependent adducts could be observed with variants of APP-C99′, particularly with the APP-C99′[Cys49] and APP-C99′[Cys59] (Fig. 2, lanes 11, 12, 15, and 16). Identification and Characterization of Specific Cross-linking Partners—The APP-C99′ polypeptide lacks any sites for N-linked glycosylation, and a preliminary analysis of the adducts shown in Fig. 2 was carried out by treating them with endoglycosidase H to establish whether any of the cross-linked components were N-glycosylated (data not shown). This analysis suggested that the ∼80-kDa adduct represented the cross-linking of the ∼14-kDa APP-C99′ polypeptide to an ER protein of ∼66 kDa (assuming the migration of the adduct reflects the true migration of its two constituents) and showed that this ER protein most likely had a single N-linked glycan that could be removed by endoglycosidase H digestion (data not shown). On this basis, the prominent ∼66-kDa cross-linking partner of APP-C99′[Cys59] (Fig. 2, lanes 15 and 16, asterisk) was identified by immunoprecipitation as ribophorin I (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 5).

Using an inactive mutant (MdfA-E26T), we isolated a spontaneous second-site mutation (MdfA-E26T/V335E) that re-established the recognition of cationic drugs by the transporter. Only a negative charge at position 335 was able to restore the functioning of the inactive mutant MdfA-E26T. Intriguingly, the two genetically interacting residues are located at remote and distinct regions along the secondary structure of MdfA.

The spatial relation between the two residues was investigated by cross-linking. A functional split version of MdfA devoid of cysteines was constructed and introduced with a cysteine pair at positions 26 and 335. Strikingly, the results indicate that residues 26 and 335 are spatially adjacent, suggesting that they both constitute parts of the multidrug recognition pocket of MdfA. The fact that electrostatic interactions are preserved with cationic substrates even if the critical acidic residue is placed on another face of the pocket reveals an additional dimension of promiscuity in multidrug recognition and transport.

The simultaneous emergence of resistance in cells to many chemically unrelated drugs is termed multidrug resistance (Mdr). 1The abbreviations used are: Mdr, multidrug transporter; LB, Luria-Bertani medium; MAL-PEG, methoxy-polyethylene glycol maleimide; NTA, nitriloacetic acid; 1,4-PDM, N,N′-1,4-phenylene-dimaleimide; TM, transmembrane domain; C4, four C-terminal TMs of MdfA; N8, eight N-terminal TMs of MdfA.1The abbreviations used are: Mdr, multidrug transporter; LB, Luria-Bertani medium; MAL-PEG, methoxy-polyethylene glycol maleimide; NTA, nitriloacetic acid; 1,4-PDM, N,N′-1,4-phenylene-dimaleimide; TM, transmembrane domain; C4, four C-terminal TMs of MdfA; N8, eight N-terminal TMs of MdfA. Mdr transporters that remove the drugs from the cell cytoplasm or cytoplasmic membrane to the external medium cause one major form of multidrug resistance. These efflux systems are common among prokaryotic microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria (1Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Curr. Opin.

Mdr transporters extrude a variety of chemically unrelated lipophilic compounds, many of which are positively charged under physiological conditions. Recently, several interesting features of multidrug recognition were revealed by structural analysis of soluble Mdr-binding proteins (5Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A.

In many cases, electrostatic interactions were found to be functionally important. MdfA is an Escherichia coli Mdr transporter (10Edgar R. Bibi E. J.

Cells expressing MdfA from a multicopy plasmid exhibit multidrug resistance to a diverse group of toxic compounds and also export other substrates, including the following: (i) lipophilic cations such as ethidium bromide, tetraphenylphosphonium, and benzalkonium; (ii) zwitterionic drugs such as ciprofloxacin; and (iii) neutral compounds such as chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the sugar isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (10Edgar R. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2274-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 16Bohn C. Bouloc P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6072-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Adler J. Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transport experiments have shown that MdfA is driven by the proton electrochemical gradient and functions as a drug/proton anti-porter (18Mine T. Morita Y. Kataoka A. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Lewinson O. Adler J. Poelarends G.J. Mazurkiewicz P. Driessen A.J. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As predicted from the hydropathy plot of the protein and confirmed by gene fusion analysis, the putative 12 transmembrane domains (TMs) of the protein contain a membrane-embedded charged amino acid residue, Glu-26, in the middle of the TM1 (20Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Adler J. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3313-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Glu-26 plays an important role in the drug-binding domain in MdfA; the negative charge at position 26 is important for the recognition of a variety of positively charged substrates but not for the recognition of neutral compounds (17Adler J. Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In recent studies it was demonstrated that, in addition to its broad spectrum of drug recognition, MdfA is also functionally promiscuous in other aspects, including a flexible multidrug recognition pocket that tolerates the binding of two substrates simultaneously (22Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12612-12618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a substrate-dependent usage of distinct driving forces (19Lewinson O. Adler J. Poelarends G.J. Mazurkiewicz P. Driessen A.J. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and an unexpected biological role in pH homeostasis (23Lewinson O. Padan E. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14073-14078Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we used a genetic screen to evaluate the promiscuity of the multidrug recognition pocket of MdfA in its ability to interact electrostatically with positively charged substrates. The results show that the electrostatic interaction is preserved even if the critical acidic residue (Glu-26) is placed in a cytoplasmic loop that forms part of the multidrug recognition pocket, thus unveiling a new dimension of tolerance in multi-drug recognition and transport. Materials—Methoxy-polyethylene glycol maleimide (MAL-PEG; molecular weight, 5000) was obtained from Shearwater Polymers, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The cross-linking reagents bismaleimidohexane and dithio-bismaleimidoethane were from Pierce, and N,N′-1,4-phenylene-dimaleimide (1,4-PDM) was from Aldrich. India HisProbe-horseradish peroxidase (from Pierce) was used for MdfA-His6 detection by Western blotting. Proteins were determined by the detergent-compatible kit from Bio-Rad. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys or the Scientific Services Unit at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Bacterial Strains—E. coli HB101 was used for the propagation and preparation of various plasmid constructs. E. coli UTmdfA::kan or the leaky strain UTL2mdfA::kan2 was used in drug resistance and transport experiments. A Second-site Genetic Screen—As a template, we used MdfA-E26X mutants that had lost their ability to confer resistance to cationic drugs (17Adler J. Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) cloned with the native 231-bp-long 5′-untranslated region of mdfA (pT7-5/mdfA-His6). To avoid possible recombination events, we used an E. coli strain deleted of the chromosomal mdfA gene (UTL2mdfA::kan). 2R. Edgar and E. Bibi, unpublished data. Cells transformed with the inactive E26X mutants were plated on LB-agar containing ampicillin (200 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml). Lethal concentrations of EtBr (250–350 μg/ml) were added to the medium for the selection of colonies resistant to this cationic substrate. In addition, the medium was supplemented by a low concentration of chloramphenicol (3 μg/ml) in order to select for multi-drug-resistant colonies only. After 24–36 h, single colonies were collected, and a plasmid mix was prepared from the resistant colonies. Next, the resistance phenotype was confirmed by retransformation. Finally, plasmid DNA was isolated from single resistant colonies, and the entire mdfA gene (including the 231-bp 5′-untranslated region) was sequenced. In addition, to assure that the acquired phenotype was not associated with another mutation elsewhere in the plasmid, we transferred the mdfA gene to a new plasmid. Construction of mdfA Mutants—To express Cys-less MdfA in two contiguous fragments, we introduced a “split” cassette into the mdfA gene as follows. For the cloning, we used plasmid pT7-5/Cys-less-mdfA/His6 expressing the His6-tagged protein under the regulation of the native 231-bp untranslated region (24Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Initially, silent mutations were introduced to create four unique restriction sites in mdfA (Fig. 6). The split cassettes were constructed by annealing pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides encoding either T7 or a His6 tag (for the subsequent detection of the N-terminal MdfA fragment). The cassettes also harbor two stop codons (TAA and TGA) to terminate translation of the N-terminal fragment, a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AAGGGGAAAAAATT), and a start codon (ATG) for translation of the C-terminal fragment. The newly created termini in the split site contained several overlapping residues (Fig. 6). The DNA constructs were verified by digestion and sequencing. Other mutations were generated in either Cys-less or wild-type pT7-5/mdfA-His6 plasmid by oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis using the overlap extension PCR method (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The mutations were verified by the sequencing of the PCR-generated segments through the ligation junctions. Double Cys mutants were generated by the shuffling of single Cys mutants. For drug resistance and transport assays, we used pT7-5/mdfA-His6 (a constitutive, low-expression system). For cross-linking experiments we used a tightly controlled expression system (plasmid pT7-5/araP/mdfA-His6) (21Adler J. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3313-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Fig. 6Characterization of split MdfA. A, secondary-structure model of the Cys-less N8/C4 split MdfA.

Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli UTmdfA::kan, expressing the mutants (in a pT7-5/mdfA-His6 configuration), was grown at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with the antibiotics ampicillin (200 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml) to an A600 of 1.5. A series of 10-fold dilutions (10–1-10–5) were prepared, and 4 μl of each dilution were spotted on plates containing the required antibiotics and different concentrations of the test drug. The ability of cells to form single colonies was visualized after 16–24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Western Blotting—Overnight cultures of E. coli UTL2mdfA::kan or UTmdfA::kan harboring pT7-5 (vector), wild-type MdfA, or the mutants (encoded by pT7-5/mdfA-His6 or pT7-5/araP/mdfA-His6) were diluted (to an A600 of 0.05) in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and grown to an A600 of 1. Where indicated, the cultures were induced by 0.2% arabinose for 1 h. Membranes were prepared as described previously (27Bibi E. Gros P. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9209-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and samples (10–20 μg protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12.5 or 15% polyacrylamide in the running gel. After electroblotting, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with India HisProbe-horseradish peroxidase and probed by enhanced chemiluminesence. Efflux of Ethidium Bromide—EtBr efflux assays were conducted as described by Edgar and Bibi (10Edgar R. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2274-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), with modifications. Overnight cultures of E. coli UTmdfA::kan cells harboring plain plasmid (pT7-5) or plasmid pT7-5/mdfA-His6 were diluted to an A600 of 0.04 and grown at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml) up to an A600 of 1–1.2. Ice-cold cell suspensions were pelleted, resuspended in 2 ml (A600 of 0.4) of potassium Pi buffer (50 mm, pH 7), and loaded with EtBr (12.5 μm) at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (100 μm). The loaded cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in the same buffer containing only EtBr (12.5 μm), and, after ∼1 min in the fluorometer, glucose was added (final concentration 0.4%). Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (50 μm) was added for dissipation of the electrochemical potential. The EtBr efflux was monitored continuously by measuring the fluorescence using excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 620 nm, respectively. Membrane Topology Studies—Overnight cultures of UTL2mdfA::kan harboring single cysteine substitutions in a Cys-less background of MdfA (in pT7-5/Cys-less mdfA-His6) were diluted to an A600 of 0.08 in LB supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin and grown at 37 °C aerobically to an A600 of ∼1.6. Cells were then harvested, washed in sodium-HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 7), and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. Each cell suspension was divided into three portions. Portions A and B were incubated with MAL-PEG (5 mm) (see Ref. 28Lu J. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13288-13301Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature. Portion B was then sonicated, and the labeling of portions A and B was terminated after one more hour at room temperature. Portion C was sonicated, and the membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (350,000 × g for 10 min). Membranes were then solubilized by 1% SDS in the same buffer for 15 min at 37 °C and incubated with MAL-PEG (5 mm) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Dithiothreitol (100 mm) was used for terminating the reaction. Portions A and B were sonicated, collected by ultracentrifugation, and solubilized in 1% SDS. Samples (30 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% polyacrylamide gel in the running gel. Western blot analysis was done as described earlier. Cross-linking Studies—Overnight cultures of UTL2mdfA::kan expressing the double cysteine MdfA mutants (in the Cys-less split MdfA, plasmid pT7-5/araP/Cys-less mdfA-His6) were grown as described in the previous section and induced with 0.2% arabinose for 1 h. Harvested cultures were washed in sodium-HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 7) and resuspended in the above buffer supplemented with dithiothreitol (1 mm). Membranes were prepared and collected as described earlier, resuspended in sodium-HEPES buffer (without dithiothreitol) at a protein concentration of ∼15 μg/μl, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at–80 °C. Cross-linking was carried out with aliquots of membrane suspension (20 μg in 40 μl of the same sodium-HEPES buffer). Cross-linking reagents (or an equivalent volume of the solvent, Me2SO) were added at 0.5–1 mm final concentration, and the mixtures were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by dithiothreitol (25 mm) and β-mercaptoethanol (2%) in a protein sample buffer. Samples (15 μg protein) were then subjected to SDS-PAGE using 15% polyacrylamide in the running gel. Western blot analysis was done as described earlier. A Second-site Mutation (V335E) in the Inactive Mutant MdfA-E26T Re-established Cationic Drug Resistance—Previous studies underscored the importance of a membrane-embedded negative charge for the recognition of cationic substrates by MdfA and other Mdr transporters. Here, we studied whether the negative charge should be placed at a certain location within the multidrug recognition pocket of MdfA. This issue was approached by utilizing a genetic screen with several MdfA-E26X mutants, which exhibit almost no transport activity with the cationic substrate EtBr (20Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the inactive mutants were plated on LB-agar-containing non-permissive doses of EtBr. Initially, only true revertants, which regained a negative charge at position 26, were identified. 2R. Edgar and E. Bibi, unpublished data. Numerous unsuccessful attempts were made in trying to select second-site suppressors before we finally succeeded in identifying a single mutant (V335E) that restored the function of the inactive MdfA-E26T mutant (17Adler J. Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with EtBr as a substrate (see Fig. 1, A and B). Using transport experiments, we demonstrated that the restoration of EtBr resistance was due to the active transport of EtBr by the double mutant MdfA-E26T/V335E (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis showed that MdfA-E26T/V335E was expressed in the membrane at levels similar to those of wild-type MdfA and the original MdfA-E26T mutant (Fig. 1D). These results raised the possibility that the negative charge at position 26 can be functionally displaced. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Val-335—To examine the possibility that a negative charge is required at position 335 of mutant MdfA-E26T, we further mutated MdfA-E26T at position 335 with negatively charged (Asp), positively charged (Lys and Arg), or uncharged (Gln, Asn, Cys, and Met) amino acids. Fig. 2A shows that all of the mutants were expressed in the membrane at levels similar to that of wild-type MdfA. The multidrug resistance profile of cells expressing the different mutants is presented in Fig. 2B (left). Remarkably, only mutants MdfA-E26T/V335E and MdfA-E26T/V335D were able to confer resistance against the cationic drugs EtBr and benzalkonium. As shown in Fig. 1C, a glutamate at position 335 was preferred over aspartate, as exemplified in the transport assay. Interestingly, the observation that the double mutants were inactive against the cationic drugs erythromycin and pyronin (Fig. 2B) is in agreement with the suggestion that displacement of Glu-26 also has a general effect on the multidrug recognition pattern of MdfA (see also Ref. 20Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, unlike mutations at position 26, the drug recognition specificity of MdfA was only marginally affected by mutations at position 335 (except for basic substitutions, Fig. 2B, bottom), suggesting that normally this region of the protein is not critically important for multi-drug specificity. When the effect of various Val-335 substitutions was tested in the context of wild-type MdfA, the drug resistance assays showed that introducing a negative charge at position 335 (V335E or V335D) generally had an inhibitory effect on MdfA, as observed with all the test substrates (Fig. 2B, right). Moreover, the effect of positively charged replacements was usually even less favorable. In contrast, neutral substitutions at position 335 did not appreciably alter the multidrug resistance activity of MdfA. Detailed Analysis of the Topology of TM10—The observation that a glutamate at position 335 functionally complements a neutral substitution at position 26 indicates that these two sites interact functionally. Mechanistically, it would be reasonable to suggest that both regions contribute to the multidrug recognition pocket of MdfA. However, such an interaction is not intuitive, because residue 26 is membrane-embedded, and previous topology studies suggest that residue 335 resides in a hydrophilic loop (21Adler J. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3313-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The putative location of residue 335 in the loop was deduced from the results of gene fusion studies, which showed that residue His-311 is located at the periplasmic site of the membrane, whereas residue Thr-348 is in a cytoplasmic loop. However, the exact orientation of the residues between His-311 and Thr-348, including Val-335, has never been analyzed. Therefore, we systematically examined the topology of TM10 and the adjacent loops using a cysteine accessibility assay (28Lu J. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13288-13301Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, 19 residues (Fig. 3A) were individually replaced by cysteines in a functional, Cys-less MdfA (24Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and their modification by a large thiol-reactive reagent, MAL-PEG, was analyzed. This approach was successfully implemented for determining the topological organization of the Kv1.3 channel (28Lu J. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13288-13301Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies with whole cells, we found that MAL-PEG (5 kDa) is able to permeate through the outer membrane of the leaky E. coli strain UTL2 (29Beja O. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5969-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and label periplasmically oriented cysteine residues. In contrast, this molecule does not traverse the inner membrane and leaves cytosolic cysteines unmodified. When the inner membrane barrier is disrupted (e.g. by sonication), MAL-PEG freely reacts with cytoplasmically oriented cysteine residues. Finally, although membrane-embedded cysteines were inaccessible to MAL-PEG in both whole and sonicated cells, they were readily modified upon detergent solubilization of the membranes (data not shown). Initially, we analyzed the expression and function of the newly constructed single Cys mutants. Fig. 3C shows that all the mutants were expressed in the cytoplasmic membrane at levels comparable with that of wild-type MdfA. The activity of each construct was then examined by using drug resistance assays. The results show that most of the mutants retained considerable multidrug resistance activity (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, however, several mutations (S321C, Y323C, R336C, and F340C) had a dramatic effect on the activity of Cys-less MdfA, indicating that these residues are structurally and/or functionally important. The effect of changing Arg-336 was particularly interesting because of its proximity to Val-335. Therefore, we analyzed additional mutants harboring positively charged (Lys and His), negatively charged (Glu and Asp), or uncharged (Gln, Asn, Cys, and Met) residues at position 336 of the otherwise wild-type MdfA. All of the mutants were properly expressed in the membrane (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, although several substitutions affected the multidrug specificity, only those harboring a negative charge (R336E and R336D) completely abolished the multidrug resistance activity of MdfA (Fig. 4B). These results provide further evidence that residues in the loop connecting TM10 and TM11 play an important role in MdfA. Finally, unlike the V335E or V335D replacements, which restore the function of MdfA-E26T, a negatively charged residue at position 336 cannot rescue this mutant (Fig. 4B). Next, we studied the topological organization of TM10 and its flanking loops (Fig. 3A) by testing the ability of MAL-PEG to modify single Cys mutants in whole cells, disrupted cells, and SDS-solubilized membranes. As expected, all of the mutants were labeled by MAL-PEG in the presence of SDS (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows the results of MAL-PEG labeling in whole (–) and disrupted (+) cells. Regarding the putative periplasmic side of TM10, only mutant MdfA-H311C was able to react very weakly with MAL-PEG in whole and disrupted cells, as reflected by a shift in the apparent molecular mass of MdfA by ∼10kDa (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W2027038736,"Osteopontin (OPN) is an important chemokinetic agent for several cell types. Our earlier studies have shown that its expression is essential for uridine triphosphate (UTP)-mediated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. We demonstrated previously that the activation of an AP-1 binding site located 76 bp upstream of the transcription start in the rat OPN promoter is involved in the induction of OPN expression. In this work, using a luciferase promoter deletion assay, we identified a new region of the rat OPN promoter (-1837 to -1757) that is responsive to UTP. This region contains an NFκB site located at -1800 and an Ebox located at -1768. Supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified NFκB and USF-1/USF-2 as the DNA binding proteins induced by UTP, respectively, for these two sites. Using dominant negative mutants of IκB kinase and USF transcription factors, we confirmed that NFκB and USF-1/USF-2 are involved in the UTP-mediated expression of OPN. Using a pharmacological approach, we demonstrated that USF proteins are regulated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 pathway, just as the earlier discovered AP-1 complex, whereas NFκB is up-regulated through PKCδ signals. Finally, our work suggests that the UTP-stimulated OPN expression involves a coordinate regulation of PKCδ-NFκB, ERK1/2-USF, and ERK1/2/NAD(P)H oxidase AP-1 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1982684050,"Abstract The Alzheimer's Aβ40 peptide forms soluble oligomers that are extremely potent neurotoxins and strongly impede synapses function. In this study the formation and structure of the large, soluble, neurotoxic Aβ40 oligomer called “β-ball” were characterized by two-dimensional NMR, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, hydrogen exchange, and equilibrium sedimentation. In acidic aqueous solution, half the Aβ40 molecules are in the β-ball state; the remainder are monomeric. The equilibrium between the two states is slow as judged by NMR linewidths and is stable for months. The kinetics of β-ball formation from monomer are biphasic with τ1 = 7 min and τ2 = 80 min with no transient helix formation. Monomeric Aβ40 is essentially devoid of stable secondary structure, although the central, Leu17–Ala21, and C-terminal, Gly29–Val40, hydrophobic regions show propensity toward adopting extended structure, and residues 22–25 tended to form a turn. We found that sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate (DSS) binds to the central hydrophobic region of monomeric Aβ40. DSS binds β-balls more strongly and caused them to double in size. Plausible micelle-like models for the β-ball structure with and without bound DSS are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2041575942,"Iron and oxygen (O2) are intimately associated in many well characterized patho-physiological processes. These include oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of mitochondrial aconitase and inactivation of this Krebs cycle enzyme by the superoxide anion (O2⋅¯), a product of the one-electron of reduction O2. In contrast to the apparent toxicity of this reaction, the biological consequences of O2⋅¯-mediated inactivation of the cytosolic counterpart of mitochondrial aconitase, commonly known as iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), are not clear. Apart from its ability to convert citrate to iso-citrate, IRP1 in its apo-form binds to iron-responsive elements in the untranslated regions of mRNAs coding for proteins involved in iron metabolism, to regulate their synthesis and thus control the cellular homeostasis of this metal. Here, we show that in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) knock-out mice, lacking Cu,Zn-SOD, an enzyme that acts to reduce the concentration of O2⋅¯ mainly in cytosol, not only is aconitase activity of IRP1 inhibited but the level of IRP1 is also strongly decreased. Despite such an evident alteration in IRP1 status, SOD1-deficient mice display a normal iron metabolism phenotype. Our findings clearly show that under conditions of O2⋅¯-mediated oxidative stress, IRP1 is not essential for the maintenance of iron metabolism in mammals.

Our findings clearly show that under conditions of O2⋅¯-mediated oxidative stress, IRP1 is not essential for the maintenance of iron metabolism in mammals. Aerobic organisms use molecular oxygen (O2) in the generation of energy. The use of O2 as the terminal electron acceptor in oxidative phosphorylation involves biochemical reactions based on the interaction of O2 with iron atoms acting as functional co-factors in the catalytic centers of a large number of proteins. However, the ability of iron to react with partially reduced forms of O2 such as the superoxide anion (O2⋅¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may lead to the formation of the hydroxyl radical (·OH), a highly destructive oxidant (1Goldstein S. Meyerstein D. Czapski G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Since no specific molecule has evolved to fulfil the role of ·OH scavenger, living organisms have developed different ways to prevent its formation. These include both O2⋅¯ (2Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). The role of O2⋅¯ in oxygen toxicity is underscored by the ubiquity and diversity of superoxide dismutases (SODs) 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; IRP, iron regulatory protein; IRE, iron-responsive element; Ft, ferritin; H-Ft, H-ferritin subunit; L-Ft, L-ferritin subunit; TfR, transferrin receptor; LIP, labile iron pool; NO, nitric oxide; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; IRP, iron regulatory protein; IRE, iron-responsive element; Ft, ferritin; H-Ft, H-ferritin subunit; L-Ft, L-ferritin subunit; TfR, transferrin receptor; LIP, labile iron pool; NO, nitric oxide; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcription. that catalyze its conversion to H2O2 and O2 (2Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Accordingly, deficiency in various forms of SOD promotes oxidative damage in a wide range of organisms (2Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). A long-standing explanation of the toxicity of O2⋅¯ proposes that it is the rate-limiting reducing factor for the pre-existing pool of free iron active in the generation of ·OH via a Fenton reaction (6McCord J.M. Day E.D. FEBS Lett. 1978; 86: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Alternatively, recent evidence coming from studies on bacteria (7Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and yeast (8De Freitas J.M. Liba A. Meneghini R. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) shows that O2⋅¯ is responsible for elevating free iron levels. A likely mechanism is based on the O2⋅¯-mediated release of iron from certain [4Fe-4S]-containing proteins, of which mitochondrial aconitase is particularly susceptible to oxidative inactivation by O2⋅¯ (10Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 11Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Kennedy M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14064-14069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In contrast to prokaryotes and yeast, higher eukaryotes possess an additional aconitase, a cytosolic counterpart of the mitochondrial enzyme playing a major role in the regulation of cellular iron metabolism (5Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). This bifunctional protein, commonly known as iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), apart from its ability to convert citrate to iso-citrate, also exhibits trans-regulatory activity. The reversible switch in function from a [4Fe-4S] aconitase to an apo-IRP1 specifically interacting with iron-responsive element (IRE)-containing mRNAs encoding the two ferritin (Ft) subunits and transferrin receptor (TfR) is accomplished by extrusion of a [4Fe-4S] cluster from the IRP1 molecule (5Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). O2⋅¯ is able to directly interact with the IRP1 iron-sulfur cluster, and thus, to inhibit the aconitase activity of this protein (12Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Evidence obtained mainly from studies using cell-free systems indicates that the reaction of O2⋅¯ with the IRP1 [4Fe-4S] center does not lead to the formation of an apo-IRP1 able to bind IRE sequences (reviewed in Ref. 13Drapier J.C. Bouton C. Oliveira L. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 315-328Google Scholar). On the other hand, a recent in vivo study demonstrated that mutation of the SOD1 gene encoding cytosolic Cu,Zn-SOD in Drosophila causes an enhancement of IRP1 RNA binding activity (14Missirlis F. Hu J. Kirby K. Hilliker A.J. Rouault T.A. Phillips J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47365-47369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The question addressed in this study was whether deficiency in the Cu,Zn-SOD in mammals, supposed to increase the O2⋅¯ steady-state level, modulates IRP1 activities, and consequently, influences iron metabolism. As an experimental model, we used mice lacking Cu,Zn-SOD activity due to disruption of the SOD1 gene (15Matzuk M.M. Dionne L. Guo Q. Kumar T.R. Lebowitz R.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4008-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed a substantial decrease in the aconitase activity of IRP1 in homozygous knock-out mice (SOD1–/–) as compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. Surprisingly, this inhibition of IRP1 enzymatic activity was associated with a marked down-regulation of IRP1 protein expression. Despite such a major alteration in IRP1 status, iron metabolism appeared to be largely unaffected in SOD1-deficient mice. Reagents—The sources of the main reagents used in this study are indicated below. All others chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Mice—A breeder pair of mice (strain B6;129S7-Sod1tm1Leb) heterozygous for a SOD1tm1Leb targeted mutation (15Matzuk M.M. Dionne L. Guo Q. Kumar T.R. Lebowitz R.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4008-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and their progeny were provided by The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Males and females heterozygous for the non-functional SOD1 allele (SOD1–/+) were intercrossed, and their progeny was kept at 24–25 °C with a light-dark cycle of 12 h. Mice received a standard laboratory diet (Labo-feed, Kcynia, Poland) and water ad libitum. Genotyping using DNA isolated from mouse tails was performed by PCR analysis according to the protocol provided by The Jackson Laboratory. Mice homozygous for the non-functional SOD1 allele (SOD1–/–) producing no SOD1 protein (15Matzuk M.M. Dionne L. Guo Q. Kumar T.R. Lebowitz R.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4008-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and control mice homozygous for the wild-type SOD1 allele (SOD1+/+) were used in the study at the age of 2 months. All procedures were approved by the Local Ethical Commission (permission number 67/2001). Preparation of Mouse Liver Extracts—Livers were excised immediately after death from mice killed by cervical dislocation, quick-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Liver samples (50 mg) were thawed and homogenized, and erythroid cells were lysed by suspension in a hypotonic solution. After a brief centrifugation, the pellets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Digitonin was then added to 0.01%, and the mixture was held at 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 1800 × g for 10 min, supernatants were collected and recentrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Portions of the fresh cytosolic extracts were immediately used for IRP1 aconitase activity determination. The remaining extracts were aliquoted and kept at –80 °C until required for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and for Western blot analysis of IRP1 and Ft levels. For IRP2 detection by Western blotting, total hepatic extracts were prepared using 50-mg samples of liver. The lysis of erythroid cells was performed as for the cytosolic extracts preparation, and then pellets were homogenized in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) containing 25 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation of homogenates at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, supernatants were collected and used immediately for IRP2 detection by Western blotting. The whole procedure of lysate preparation was performed anaerobically under a flux of argon to avoid IRP2 oxidation. Determination of Aconitase Activity—Aconitase activity in liver cytosolic extracts was measured spectrophotometrically by following the disappearance of cis-aconitate at 240 nm at 37 °C, as described previously (16Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—IRP1-IRE interactions were examined as described previously (17Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) by incubating 2 μg of the cytosolic protein extracts with a molar excess of [32P]CTP-labeled H-ferritin IRE probe. In parallel experiments, cytosolic extracts were treated with 2-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 2% before the addition of the IRE probe to produce maximal IRE-binding activity (18Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). IRE-protein complexes were then separated by electrophoresis on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The signals representing the IRE-IRP1 complexes were quantified with a Molecular Imager using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Western Blotting—Fifty micrograms of liver cytosolic (for IRP1 and Ft subunits detection) or total (for IRP2 detection) extracts were resolved on 8 (for IRP1 and IRP2 detection) or 15% (for Ft subunit detection) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were initially blocked by gentle agitation in Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 5% fat-free dry milk at room temperature for 1 h followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with a chicken polyclonal antibody raised against purified human recombinant IRP1 (Agro-Bio, La Ferté Saint-Aubin, France), antibody raised against IRP2 peptide, YQKAGKLSPLKVQPKKLP (Neosystems, Strasbourg, France), or rabbit antisera raised against recombinant mouse H- and L-Ft (kindly provided by Dr. P. Santambrogio, Milan, Italy). Membranes were then washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system ECL Plus (Amersham Life Sciences). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis of IRP1 mRNA Abundance—For RT-PCR analysis, total cellular RNA was extracted from liver samples (20 mg) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two micrograms of total RNA were used for reverse-transcription with superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 45 °C for 1 h. Of this reaction, 2 μl were then taken for PCR amplification with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using the respective pairs of oligonucleotide primers indicated in Table I. PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels run with Tris-borate-EDTA buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. The bands were quantified with a Molecular Imager using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) and normalized to those for a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene control.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCR analysismRNAForward primerReverse primerAmplified fragmentmurine IRP15′-CAGCCACCCAAGTCCAATAGT-3′5′-GCGTCGAATACATCAAGGGT-3′296 bpmurine GAPDH5′-GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′489 bpmurine H-Ft5′-CTTCAGGGGCACCCATCTT-3′5′-TGACAAGAATGATCCCCAC-3′122 bpmurine L-Ft5′-GTAGAGGAGGTCCCGTGGAT-3′5′-AAGAGACGGTGCAGACTGGT-3′393 bpmurine TfR5′-TGCAGCAGCTCTTGAGATTG-3′5′-GTTGAGGCAGACCTTGCACT-3′156 bp Open table in a new tab Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—IRP1, H-Ft, L-Ft, and TfR hepatic mRNAs were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using a Light Cycler (Roche Diagnostics). The same cDNA templates and respective primers indicated in Table I were used. The detection of amplification products was carried out using SYBR Green (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (19Simpson D.A.C. Feeney S. Boyle C. Stitt A.W. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm amplification specificity, the PCR products from each primer pair were subjected to melting curve analysis and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. For data analysis, Light Cycler 3.5 Software was used. Quantification was performed relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control. Isolation of Mouse Peritoneal Cells and LIP Assay—Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the peritoneal cavities were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4. The lavage fluid from individual mice was centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. Sedimented cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, counted, checked for their viability by trypan blue exclusion, and processed for labile iron pool (LIP) measurement using the fluorescent probe calcein as described previously (20Epsztejn S. Kakhlon O. Glickstein H. Breuer W. Cabantchik Z.I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Non-heme Iron Determination—Quantification of the non-heme iron content liver fragments (100 mg) was performed using a BIOCHEMTEST (Polish Chemical Reagents, Gliwice, Poland) as described previously (21Torrance J.D. Bothwell T.H. Methods Hematol. 1980; 1: 90-115Google Scholar). Total Iron Determination—Liver samples (0.5 g) were mineralized in a mixture of 5 ml of HNO3 and 1 ml of H2O2 in a microwave oven (Ethos 900, Milestone). Iron content was estimated by flame (air-acetylene) atomic absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences 1100B) (248.3 nm). The external standards were prepared using a 9972 Titrisol iron standard (Merck). Hematological Analysis of Mice—Heparinized blood was obtained by direct heart puncture immediately after death. Blood cell counts and erythrocyte parameters were determined using an automated SYMEX F820 Analyzer. Protein Determination—The protein content of extracts was determined spectrophotometrically at 595 nm by the method of Bradford using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Statistical Analysis—For statistical evaluation, one-way analysis of variance was applied. For estimation of the significance of difference between arithmetic means, the Scheffe test was used. All calculations were done using Statgraphics Plus 6.0 software. It is generally believed that the generation of extremely toxic ·OH through the Fenton reaction is the main point at which the pathologic interaction between oxygen and iron occurs. In mammals, the participation of iron in ·OH formation is limited by numerous proteins implicated in iron trafficking, storage, and redox state regulation (22Andrews N.C. Semin. Hematol. 2002; 39: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the iron-related toxicity of reactive oxygen species, i.e. O2⋅¯ and H2O2, is not limited to their direct redox reactions with iron leading to ·OH formation but may also involve disturbance of regulatory mechanisms underlying the homeostasis of this metal (23Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). A primary response to extracellular H2O2 is the induction of IRP1 RNA binding activity (24Martins E.A. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 101-108Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar), which results in a coordinated pattern of down- and up-regulation of Ft and TfR expression, respectively, and subsequent rearrangement of cellular iron (26Caltagirone A. Weiss G. Pantopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The superoxide anion, like intracellular H2O2 (24Martins E.A. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 101-108Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar), has the ability to mediate partial disassembly of the IRP1 [4Fe-4S] cluster, which proceeds by its oxidation, the subsequent release of one iron atom, and the generation of a so-called “null” [3Fe-4S] form of IRP1, active neither as an aconitase nor as a trans-regulator (27Drapier J-C. Bouton C. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is important to note that evidence of the generation of a non-functional IRP1 form by O2⋅¯ comes from experiments in which mammalian cell lysates were exposed to a bolus flux of O2⋅¯ produced enzymatically (12Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Cairo G. Castrusini E. Minotti G. Bernelli-Zazzera A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1326-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, the role of increased cytosolic O2⋅¯ in the inactivation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of IRP1 has been shown in Cu,Zn-SOD-deficient Drosophila (14Missirlis F. Hu J. Kirby K. Hilliker A.J. Rouault T.A. Phillips J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47365-47369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to the aforementioned in vitro studies, increased O2⋅¯ in Drosophila-null mutants for SOD1 resulted not only in inhibition of IRP1 aconitase activity but also in activation of IRP1 IRE binding (14Missirlis F. Hu J. Kirby K. Hilliker A.J. Rouault T.A. Phillips J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47365-47369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the effect of complete SOD1 deficiency in mammals on IRP1 activities and the consequences for iron metabolism regulation. For this purpose, we used mice lacking the Cu,Zn-SOD activity due to disruption of the SOD1 gene (15Matzuk M.M. Dionne L. Guo Q. Kumar T.R. Lebowitz R.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4008-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Considering the high expression of both IRP1 (29Meyron-Holtz E.G. Ghosh M.C. Iwai K. LaVaute T. Brazzolotto X. Berger U.V. Land W. Ollivierre-Wilson H. Grinberg A. Love P. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and SOD1 (30Ho Y-S. Gargano M. Cao J. Bronson R.T. Heimler I. Hutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7765-7769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) in liver, and the key role of this organ in the regulation of mammalian iron homeostasis (31Knutson M. Wessling-Resnick M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 61-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), we focused our analysis on hepatic IRP1 and measured most parameters of iron metabolism in this tissue. As expected, we found a substantial >80% decrease in the aconitase activity of IRP1 in SOD1–/– mice as compared with their wild-type, SOD1+/+ siblings (Fig. 1A). These results are reminiscent of those showing inactivation of cytosolic aconitase in mammalian cell lines in response to O2⋅¯ (10Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 12Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We also observed that spontaneous IRE binding activity of IRP1 is decreased in SOD1–/– as compared with WT mice (Fig. 1B), a finding that recalls those obtained after exposure of recombinant IRP1 to a bolus flux of O2⋅¯ (28Cairo G. Castrusini E. Minotti G. Bernelli-Zazzera A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1326-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or after treatment of cells with O2⋅¯-generating compounds (32Gehring N.H. Hentze M.W. Pantopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6219-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in SOD1–/– mice, maximal IRP1 binding activity present in 2-mercaptoethanol-treated hepatic cytosolic extracts revealed almost the same decrease as for aconitase activity (Fig. 1B). Since assessment of total IRP1 IRE binding activity is considered an indirect measure of IRP1 level (18Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), this finding suggested that the content of IRP1 protein is greatly reduced in SOD1–/– mice. Indeed, direct measurement of IRP1 in liver cytosolic extracts by Western blotting confirmed the results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments and revealed a >80% decrease in IRP1 level in knock-out SOD1 versus normal mice (Fig. 1C). We next determined whether this diminution in the amount of IRP1 at the protein level reflected a decrease in the level of IRP1 mRNA. Quantification of IRP1 mRNA content by both semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2, A and B) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2C) consistently showed a reduction of IRP1 mRNA in knock-out SOD1 mice of about 30–40% relative to the WT. These analyses suggest that the substantial decrease in IRP1 protein content in SOD1-deficient mice may be only partially due to less efficient transcription of the IRP1 gene or decreased stability of IRP1 mRNA. Considering that degradation of several [Fe-S] cluster-containing enzymes is associated with alterations in their clusters (33Grune T. Blasig I.E. Sitte N. Roloff B. Haseloff R. Davies K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6058-6064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to propose that down-regulation of IRP1 in SOD1–/– mice may also be due to an increased susceptibility of this protein to proteolytic degradation after destabilization of its [4Fe-4S] cluster by O2⋅¯. This proposal may be further supported by the evidence of a relationship between protein oxidation under conditions of O2⋅¯-mediated stress and the increased susceptibility of oxidatively damaged proteins to proteolysis by proteasome (35Salo D.C.

A, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) amplicon was used as a control for the amount of cDNA used in the PCR reactions. B, PCR product bands were quantified with a Molecular Imager using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), and the means ± S.D. are plotted in arbitrary units (n = 4). C, IRP1 mRNA abundance in livers was measured by real-time RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each column represents the mean (± S.D. for SOD1–/– mice) of two amplification reactions, performed on a single cDNA sample reverse-transcribed from RNA prepared from three mice.

Caltagirone A. Segal P. Pantopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6973-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also considered the possibility that aberrations in zinc metabolism in SOD1 knock-out mice, reported previously in yeast SOD1 mutants (40Wei J.P. Srinivasan C. Han H. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44798-44803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), could be the cause of altered IRP1 IRE binding. In this respect, it is noteworthy that inhibition of IRP1 binding to IRE due to specific in vitro aggregation of purified IRP1 apo-protein in the presence of micromolar concentrations of zinc has been recently reported (41Martelli A. Moulis J.M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 1413-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Disruption of zinc homeostasis has been proposed to be one of several possible factors responsible for protein precipitation observed in several neurodegenerative disorders (42Cuajungco M.P.

https://openalex.org/W2015813267,"A scheme of eukaryotic phylogeny has been suggested based on the structure and physical linkage of the RNA triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase enzymes that catalyze mRNA cap formation. Here we show that the unicellular pathogen Giardia lamblia encodes an mRNA capping apparatus consisting of separate triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components, which we characterize biochemically. We also show that native Giardia mRNAs have blocked 5′-ends and that 7-methylguanosine caps promote translation of transfected mRNAs in Giardia in vivo. The Giardia triphosphatase belongs to the tunnel family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that includes the RNA triphosphatases of fungi, microsporidia, and protozoa such as Plasmodium and Trypanosoma. The tunnel enzymes adopt a unique active-site fold and are structurally and mechanistically unrelated to the cysteine-phosphatase-type RNA triphosphatases found in metazoans and plants, which comprise part of a bifunctional triphosphataseguanylyltransferase fusion protein. All available evidence now points to the separate tunnel-type triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase as the aboriginal state of the capping apparatus. We identify a putative tunnel-type triphosphatase and a separate guanylyltransferase encoded by the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. These findings place fungi, protozoa, and red algae in a common lineage distinct from that of metazoa and plants.

The m7GpppN cap is a defining feature of eukaryotic mRNA that is formed via three enzymatic reactions: (i) the 5′-triphosphate end of the pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase; (ii) the diphosphate RNA end is capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase; and (iii) the GpppN cap is methylated by RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (1.Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Capping enzymes are a good focal point for considering eukaryotic evolution, because the cap structure is thought to be ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms but absent from the bacterial and archaeal domains of life. Thus, any differences in the capping apparatus between eukaryal taxa would reflect events that post-date the emergence of ancestral nucleated cells. Previously, we proposed a scheme of eukaryotic phylogeny based on two features of the mRNA capping apparatus: the structure and mechanism of the triphosphatase component (metal-dependent fungal-type versus metal-independent cysteine-phosphatase type) and whether the triphosphatase is covalently fused to the guanylyltransferase component (2.Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3.Shuman S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Metazoans and plants have a two-component capping system consisting of a bifunctional triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase polypeptide and a separate methyltransferase polypeptide, whereas fungi, microsporidia, and protozoa (e.g. Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei) have a three-component system consisting of separate triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and methyltransferase polypeptides (2.Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4.Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 96-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The primary structures and biochemical mechanisms of the fungal and mammalian guanylyltransferases and cap methyltransferases are conserved. However, the atomic structures and catalytic mechanisms of the fungal and mammalian RNA triphosphatases are completely different (6.Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7.Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Metazoan and plant RNA triphosphatases belong to the cysteine-phosphatase enzyme superfamily, which is defined by the conserved phosphate-binding loop motif HCxxxxxR(S/T). Mammalian RNA triphosphatase catalyzes a two-step phosphoryl transfer reaction in which the conserved cysteine of the signature motif attacks the γ-phosphorus of triphosphate-terminated RNA to form a covalent protein-cysteinyl-S-phosphate intermediate and expel the diphosphate RNA product (7.Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8.Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate is hydrolyzed to liberate inorganic phosphate. The reaction does not require a divalent cation cofactor. In contrast, the RNA triphosphatases of fungal species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe are strictly dependent on a divalent cation. The fungal enzymes belong to a family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that embraces the triphosphatase components of the P. falciparum, T. brucei, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Chlorella virus, poxvirus, and baculovirus mRNA capping systems (2.Ho C.K.

The signature biochemical property of this enzyme family is the ability to hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates and inorganic phosphate in the presence of manganese or cobalt. The defining structural features of the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases are two glutamate-containing motifs that are required for catalysis by every family member and which comprise the metal-binding site. The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase Cet1 revealed a novel tertiary structure in which the active site is situated within a topologically closed hydrophilic tunnel composed of eight antiparallel β strands (6.Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The radically different flavors of RNA triphosphatase exemplify an unusual situation in nature, whereby two different structural solutions to an enzyme chemistry problem (gamma phosphate hydrolysis, a fairly pedestrian reaction) have evolved within a single biological pathway. When and how did the RNA triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus diverge during eukaryotic evolution and will the differences in the organization of the capping apparatus continue to provide a useful guide to phylogenetic relationships among taxa as more genomic information becomes available? We are pursuing these questions by identifying the cap-forming enzymes of unicellular eukaryotes and evaluating their structural and mechanistic relatedness to exemplary fungal and mammalian enzymes. Here we focus on the amitochondriate protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia. In addition to being a significant enteric pathogen of humans, Giardia is posited to occupy a deeply branching position in eukaryal phylogeny. Analysis of the sequence of the 12-Mb Giardia genome is providing important insights to the early origins of RNA processing mechanisms, such as spliceosomal pre-mRNA splicing, which are regarded as uniquely eukaryal (14.Nixon J.E.J. Wang A. Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Sogin M.L. Loftus B.J. Samuelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3701-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although it has been a matter of some debate whether Giardia mRNAs even have a 5′ cap structure (15.Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Botka C.W. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16.Knodler L.A. Svärd S.G. Silberman J.D. Davids B.J. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we show here that Giardia does possess the enzymatic machinery for cap synthesis, modifies the 5′-ends of its mRNAs, and exploits the m7G cap for enhanced translation of a reporter mRNA in vivo. Biochemical characterization of the separately encoded triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase of Giardia shows that they resemble the capping enzymes of fungi and protozoa. Mining of other newly available genome databases permitted the identification of candidate cap-forming enzymes in the unicellular red alga C. merolae (17.Matsuzaki M. Misumi O. Shin-I T. Maruyama S. Takahara M. Miyagishima S. Mori T. Nishida K. Yagisawa F. Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Nishimura Y. Makao S. Kobayashi T. Momoyama Y. Higashiyama T. Minoda A. Sano M. Nomoto H. Oishi K. Hayashi H. Ohta F.

Kuroiwa T. Nature. 2004; 428: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) and the water mold Phytopthera ramorum. The red alga separately encodes a tunnel family RNA triphosphatase and a guanylyltransferase, whereas P. ramorum appears to encode a bifunctional fusion enzyme consisting of an N-terminal tunnel-type-triphosphatase domain and a C-terminal guanylyltransferase domain. We integrate these findings into an expanded cap-centric scheme of eukaryotic phylogeny. Giardia Cultivation—Trophozoites of the G. lamblia isolate WB, clone WB/1267 (ATCC number 50582), were cultured essentially as described previously (33.Keister D.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trp. Med. Hyg. 1983; 77: 487-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Cells were maintained anaerobically in glass culture tubes at 37 °C in Keister's modified TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with antibiotics in which the sodium phosphate buffer was replaced by a 25 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer. This change had no detectable effect on parasite growth. Recombinant G. lamblia RNA Triphosphatase—The open reading frame encoding GlCet1 was PCR-amplified from Giardia genomic DNA with primers that introduced an NdeI site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into a customized T7 RNA polymerase-based pET-His10-Smt3 expression vector, wherein the GlCet1 was fused to an N-terminal His10-Smt3 domain (18.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 19.Gong C. Martins A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50843-50852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An E58A missense mutation was introduced into the GlCET1 gene by the PCR-based two-stage overlap extension method. The mutated PCR product was inserted into the pET-His10-Smt3 vector. The inserts of the resulting pET-His10-Smt3-GlCET1 and pET-His10-Smt3-GlCET1-E58A plasmids were sequenced completely to confirm the presence of the wild-type open reading frame or the desired mutation and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. The wild-type and E58A pET-His10-Smt3-GlCET1 plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3). Cultures (500 ml) amplified from single transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.6. The cultures were adjusted to 2% ethanol and 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and then incubated at 17 °C for 20 h with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Cell lysis was achieved by the addition of lysozyme and Triton X-100 to final concentrations of 100 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extracts were applied to 1-ml columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The columns were washed with 10 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 2.5-ml aliquots of buffer A containing 50, 100, 250, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The 54-kDa recombinant His10-Smt3-GlCet1 polypeptide was recovered predominantly in the 250 and 500 mm imidazole fractions. The 250 mm imidazole eluates were dialyzed against buffer A containing 2 mm DTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase; TAP, tobacco acid pyrophosphatase; aa, amino acid; NOR, NADH oxidoreductase; TMG, 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine. and 0.01% Triton X-100 and then stored at –80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of serial dilutions of the GlCet1 preparation and a BSA standard. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the staining intensities of the His10-Smt3-GlCet1 and BSA polypeptides were quantified with a Fuji film FLA-5000 digital imaging and analysis system. GlCet1 concentrations were calculated by interpolation to the BSA standard curve. Triphosphatase Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and GlCet1 as specified were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. An aliquot (2 μl) of the mixture was applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was developed using 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The radiolabeled material was visualized by autoradiography, and 32Pi formation was quantified by scanning the TLC plate with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. Alternatively, reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm unlabeled NTP, and GlCet1 as specified were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 1 ml of malachite green reagent (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phosphate release was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. Recombinant G. lamblia Guanylyltransferase—The open reading frame encoding GlCeg1 was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into a T7 RNA polymerase-based bacterial expression vector pET16b-Nco (which contains an NcoI site instead of a NdeI site) so as to fuse the GlCeg1 protein to an NH2-terminal 14-amino acid leader peptide (MGHHHHHHHHHHSA). pET-His-GlCEG1 was transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3). A 500-ml culture amplified from a single transformant was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.6. The culture was adjusted to 2% ethanol and 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and then incubated at 17 °C for 20 h. Recombinant His10-GlCeg1 was isolated from the soluble bacterial extract by nickel-agarose chromatography as described above for His10-Smt3-Gl-Cet1. The recombinant His10-GlCeg1 polypeptide was recovered predominantly in the 250 mm and 500 mm imidazole fractions. The 250 mm imidazole eluate was dialyzed against buffer A containing 2 mm DTT and 0.01% Triton X-100 and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Guanylyltransferase Assay—Guanylyltransferase activity was assayed by the formation of the covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and [α-32P]GTP and enzyme as specified were incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was halted by addition of SDS to 1% final concentration. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Transfer of labeled GMP to the GlCeg1 protein was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—An aliquot (40 μg) of the nickelagarose preparation of GlCeg1 was mixed with catalase (40 μg), BSA (40 μg), and cytochrome c (40 μg). The mixture was applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged for 14 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm. Fractions (∼0.19 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. The polypeptide compositions of the gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cap-dependent 5′-RACE Assay—The state of the 5′-end of specific Giardia transcripts was determined by using the GeneRacer™ kit from Invitrogen, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA was isolated from Giardia using RNA-STAT 60 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and then treated with DNase I (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) to remove all remaining DNA. Four separate reactions were established in parallel for each transcript to be assayed: 1) untreated; 2) treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP); 3) treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP); and 4) treated with CIP and TAP. To remove all unmodified phosphates from the 5′-end of transcripts, RNA in the CIP and CIP + TAP tubes was initially dephosphorylated (10 units of CIP per 1 μg of total RNA) at 50 °C for 60 min. Untreated and TAP-only tubes were processed in parallel without the addition of CIP. To remove modified phosphate structures from the 5′-end of RNA transcripts and leave a single 5′-phosphate behind, CIP was then removed by phenol:chloroform extraction. RNA in the TAP and CIP + TAP samples was subsequently treated with TAP (0.5 unit/1 μg of total RNA) at 37 °C for 60 min. Untreated and CIP-treated samples were processed in parallel without the addition of enzyme. To provide an anchor for subsequent PCR reactions, 0.25 μg of the GeneRacer™ oligoribonucleotide (5′-CGACUGGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGACUGAAGGAGUAGAAA-3′) was ligated to the 5′-end of RNA molecules that retained a 5′-phosphate. The RNA was then reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer according to the manufacturer's protocol (SuperScript™II RT, Invitrogen). The RNA template was degraded with RNase H and then PCR amplification of the cDNA was performed using primers that matched the GeneRacer™ RNA oligonucleotide at the 5′-end (5′-CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA-3′) and a gene-specific primer at the 3′-end (Table I). For rare transcripts, a second round of nested PCR was performed using the GeneRacer™ 5′ Nested Primer (5′-GGACACTGACATGGACTGAAGGAGTA-3′) and another gene-specific primer. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining the gel with ethidium bromide.Table IPCR primers for cap-dependent 5′-RACEGenePrimer nameSequencePCRSize expectedbpα2-TubulinTUB800GATGGGCGCGTACGAGCAGAGCGGGPrimary800GlutamateGDH800CTCCTCGTTGAACCCGTCCTTGTCGPrimary800dehydrogenaseGDH600CGGCCTGATGAAAGACCCGCCCCACNested600NOR-sense5H3NORGCGGGATCCTTACTCGAAGAGCTTCAGGTAPrimary40032F8CCAAAGGCCCATCCGTACGTCAGCANested300NOR-antisense32R4CCGGAGAGCCTCGCCACAGTGCGTTPrimary80032R6ATAGGGATAACATTAACCACACTAGNested250 Open table in a new tab Luciferase Expression Assays—Plasmids pT7Luc and pT7LucA50 (34.Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Gallie. Transcription from either plasmid yields a luciferase transcript with an 8-nucleotide 5′ leader. Transcription from pT7LucA50 results in a 50-nucleotide 3′ poly(A) tail, whereas transcripts produced from pT7Luc have no poly(A) tail. The plasmids were linearized by digestion with BamHI and DraI, respectively, and mRNA was synthesized by using AmpliScribe and AmpliCap T7 in vitro transcription kits (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). RNA was recovered after DNase I digestion, phenol extraction, and ammonium acetate precipitation. RNA was quantified by UV absorbance and RNA integrity was judged by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. For transfection experiments, 10 million trophozoites were resuspended in 800 μl of cytomix with 50 units of RNAsin (Promega) and 10 μg of yeast tRNA and then kept on ice (25.Li L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14656-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 20 μg of luciferase transcripts were added and cells were electroporated at 800 V, 1260 microfarads, and 500 V in a 0.4-cm cuvette using a BTX ECM600 electroporator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Cells were kept on ice an additional 10 min and then placed in 15 ml of fresh medium for the indicated times. Cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined as described (35.Singer S.M. Yee J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Identification of a Candidate G. lamblia Triphosphatase GlCet1—We identified a candidate Giardia RNA triphosphatase gene (Genbank™ accession number AACB01000007) on the third iteration of a psi-blast search of the NCBI data base with the T. brucei RNA triphosphatase TbCet1. The putative Giardia triphosphatase gene encodes a 344-aa polypeptide (Genbank™ accession number EAA42388) with primary structure similarity to the catalytic domain of fungal, viral, and protozoal RNA triphosphatases. We named this gene product GlCet1 (capping enzyme triphosphatase). GlCet1 includes the two glutamate-containing metal-binding motifs characteristic of the tunnel triphosphatases (Fig. 1), plus putative homologs of the other β strands that comprise the active site of yeast Cet1 (Fig. 2) (6.Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Ten hydrophilic amino acids that are essential for catalysis are conserved in the Giardia polypeptide (denoted by dots in Fig. 2) (10.Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11.Gong C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15317-15324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is notable that a psi-blast search using the GlCet1 sequence itself failed to identify any other member of the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatase family, thus accounting for previously unannotated status of this Giardia gene product.Fig. 2The tunnel family of metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases. The amino acid sequences of the G. lamblia triphosphatase (GlCet1) and the C. merolae triphosphatase (CmCet1) are aligned to the sequences of the catalytic domains of RNA triphosphatases of S. cerevisiae (ScCet1 and ScCth1), C. albicans (CaCet1), S. pombe (SpPct1), Gibberella zeae (GzCet1), Neurospora crassa (NcCet1), P. falciparum (PfPrt1), Chlorella virus (cvRtp1), E. cuniculi (EcCet1), Leishmania major (LmCet1), and T. brucei (TbCet1). The β strands that form the triphosphate tunnel are denoted above the sequence. Gaps in the alignment are indicated by dashes. Inter-strand inserts in PfPrt1, LmCet1, and CmCet1 are omitted from the alignment and denoted by Δ. Peptide segments with the highest degree of conservation in all seven proteins are highlighted by the shaded boxes. Essential hydrophilic amino that comprise the active site within the Cet1 tunnel are denoted by dots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Metal-dependent Triphosphatase Activity of GlCet1—The putative triphosphatase was produced in bacteria as a His10-Smt3 fusion protein and partially purified from a soluble bacterial extract by adsorption to nickel-agarose and elution with 250 mm imidazole. The nickel-agarose preparation was enriched with respect to the recombinant Giardia polypeptide, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). We purified in parallel a mutated version of GlCet1 in which Glu58 was replaced by alanine (Fig. 3A). Glu58 corresponds to one of the signature metal-binding residues of the tunnel enzyme family. Recombinant wild-type GlCet1 catalyzed the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of manganese; the extent of ATP hydrolysis was proportional to enzyme concentration (Fig. 3B). The ATPase activity of the E58A mutant was <1% of the activity of wild-type enzyme. We conclude that the observed phosphohydrolase activity is intrinsic to GlCet1. GlCet1 catalyzed no detectable ATP hydrolysis in the absence of a divalent cation (Fig. 4A). ATP activity was optimal at 2.5 mm MnCl2 and declined slightly at 5 mm MnCl2. Cobalt also satisfied the metal requirement; activity was optimal at 2.5–5 mm CoCl2. No activity was observed when the manganese and cobalt concentrations were below the level of input ATP. Magnesium supported only feeble ATP hydrolysis at up to 5 mm concentration (Fig. 4A). Specificity for NTP hydrolysis in the presence of manganese and cobalt is characteristic (indeed, virtually diagnostic) of the fungal-type RNA triphosphatase family. The rate of release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP was identical to the rate of conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP in a parallel reaction mixture containing the same concentration of GlCet1 (Fig. 4C), indicating that GlCet1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. From the initial rate, we estimate a turnover number of 3.4 s–1. We detected only low levels of [α-32P]AMP formation during the reaction. NTP specificity was examined by colorimetric assay of the release of Pi from unlabeled ATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP. GlCet1 displayed nearly equivalent specific activity with each of the four ribonucleoside triphosphates (Fig. 4B). Identification and Characterization of Giardia Guanylyltransferase GlCeg1—We identified a candidate mRNA guanylyltransferase gene (GenBank™ accession number AACB01000002) encoding a 511-aa polypeptide (GenBank™ accession number EAA42847) with extensive similarity to fungal, protozoal, metazoan, and virus-encoded RNA guanylyltransferases (Fig. 1). We named this gene product GlCeg1 (capping enzyme guanylyltransferase). GlCeg1 contains the six conserved peptide motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, V, and VI) that comprise the active site of GTP binding and nucleotidyl transfer (Fig. 1) (1.Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Recombinant His10-GlCeg1 was produced in bacteria and isolated from a soluble bacterial extract by nickelagarose chromatography. The 59-kDa Giardia polypeptide adsorbed to the affinity resin and was eluted with 50–250 mm imidazole (Fig. 5A). All known cellular guanylyltransferases employ a ping-pong reaction mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer through a covalent enzyme-(lysyl-N)-GMP intermediate (1.Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, guanylyltransferase activity can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity by label transfer from [α-32P]GTP to the enzyme. To assay guanylyltransferase activity of the expressed GlCeg1 protein, we incubated the initial soluble bacterial extract and the nickel-agarose column fractions with [α-32P]GTP and a divalent cation. This resulted in the formation of an SDS-stable ∼60-kDa nucleotidyl-protein adduct (Fig. 5A). The guanylyltransferase activity eluted in parallel with the GlCeg1 protein. Formation of the covalent intermediate was optimal at pH 8.0"

The intein that interrupts the DNA polymerase II DP2 subunit in Pyrococcus abyssi can be overexpressed and purified as an unspliced precursor, which allows for a detailed in vitro kinetic analysis of the individual steps of protein splicing. The first order rate constant for splicing of this intein, which has a non-canonical Gln at its C terminus, is 9.3 × 10-6 s-1 at 60 °C.

The first order rate constant of C-terminal cleavage is 1.2 × 10-5 s-1 with Gln at the C-terminal position, 2.8 × 10-4 s-1 with Asn, and decreases significantly with mutation of the penultimate His of the intein to Ala. N-terminal cleavage is most efficient between pH 7 and 7.5 and decreases at both more acidic and alkaline pH values, whereas C-terminal cleavage and splicing are both efficient over a broader range of pH values.

N-terminal cleavage is most efficient between pH 7 and 7.5 and decreases at both more acidic and alkaline pH values, whereas C-terminal cleavage and splicing are both efficient over a broader range of pH values. Protein splicing involves the post-translational, self-directed excision of an intervening polypeptide, or intein, from flanking polypeptides, or exteins. The splicing process also involves the specific ligation of the extein segments by an amide bond, concomitant with the excision of the intein (1Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).The canonical mechanism of protein splicing consists of four separate but coordinated chemical steps each directed by the intein without the assistance of other proteins or cofactors (1Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The first step of splicing is an N–S or N–O acyl rearrangement of the amide bond linking the N-extein and intein (see Fig. 1, step 1). This is followed by a transesterification that transfers the N-extein to the side chain of the N-terminal Cys, Ser, or Thr of the C-extein (see Fig. 1, step 2). The third step of splicing couples the cyclization of the C-terminal Asn of the intein to peptide bond cleavage, and excises the intein from the newly ligated exteins (see Fig. 1, step 3). Finally, the ester bond linking the exteins is rearranged to an amide (see Fig. 1, step 4), and the C-terminal aminosuccinimide of the intein is presumably hydrolyzed to either Asn or iso-Asn (see Fig. 1, step 5).Inteins that splice via variations of the canonical mechanism have previously been described. For instance, our group recently described the protein splicing of the intein that interrupts the DNA polymerase II DP2 subunit in Pyrococcus abyssi (Pab), 1The abbreviations used are: Pab, P. abyssi; PolII, DNA polymerase II; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; Ssp, Synechocystis sp.

Chem. 2004; 279: 3121-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the intein that interrupts the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) of the Chilo iridescent virus can facilitate protein splicing with a C-terminal Gln and that the intein interrupting the RNR of Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans can facilitate protein splicing with a C-terminal Asp.Our group also demonstrated that the penultimate His residue is required for efficient protein splicing of the Pab PolII intein and that N-terminal cleavage (see Fig. 1, step 7) occurs in place of splicing in its absence (2Mills K.V.

The role of the penultimate His in facilitating Asn cyclization and protein splicing varies by intein. For instance, its replacement by mutation can inhibit protein splicing (4Cooper A.A. Chen Y.J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, other inteins undergo efficient protein splicing with penultimate residues other than His, and the replacement of the these residues with His in these inteins can either reduce, enhance, or have no measurable effect on the extent of splicing (7Chen L.

To generate mutations of pPolWT, plasmid pPabPolIHis was digested with XmnI and ClaI and ligated with appropriate oligonucleotides to generate pPabPolQN and pPabPolQNHA, which encode proteins QN and QNHA, described previously as proteins PolQN and PolQNHA (2Mills K.V.

The same procedure was used to generate plasmids pPabPolQACA and pPabPolQA, which encode proteins QACA and QA, respectively (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Schematic illustration of fusion proteins. A, fusion proteins used to study N-terminal cleavage reactions consist of N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP), followed by the four C-terminal amino acids of the N-extein, the 185 residue intein, the six N-terminal residues of the C-extein, and a His tag.

Plasmid pPabC1AWT encodes C1AWT, an in-frame fusion of the N-terminal sequence MKL with the four C-terminal residues of the N-extein, the 185 residues of the intein (with a C1A mutation), the six N-terminal residues of the C-extein, and a hexahistidine tag. This shortened N-extein is used to make the precursor and product of C-terminal cleavage easier to resolve via SDS-PAGE. Plasmids pPabPolQN, pPabPolHA, and pPabPolQNHA were used in the same manner to prepare plasmids pPabC1AQN, pPabC1AHA, and pPabC1AQNHA, respectively, which encode proteins C1AQN, C1AHA and C1AQNHA, respectively (see Fig. 2).The DNA sequence of the newly created plasmids was verified by sequencing at Macrogen, Inc. (Seoul, South Korea). Plasmid-encoded proteins were overexpressed and purified as described previously (2Mills K.V. Manning J.S. Garcia A.M. Wuerdeman L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20685-20691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Reaction Conditions—Except where indicated, N-terminal cleavage reactions were performed at 60 °C using 0.4 μm proteins in buffer N (155 mm BisTris propane, pH 7.0, 57 mm NaCl, 11 mm imidazole, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm TCEP, and 50 mm DTT, with a final pH of 7.1 at 23 °C). C-terminal cleavage reactions were performed at 60 °C using 1.0 μm proteins in buffer C (155 mm BisTris Propane, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm TCEP, with a final pH of 7.2 at 23 °C). Cleavage reactions were terminated by the addition of New England Biolabs 3× SDS-PAGE buffer and then supplemented with DTT prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. For determination of the pH dependence of protein reactions, BisTris propane at pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.0, or 9.0 was substituted for the BisTris propane of pH 7.0 above, and the pH values of the final protein mixtures were determined experimentally at 23 °C.Protein Analysis—Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described previously (2Mills K.V. Manning J.S. Garcia A.M. Wuerdeman L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20685-20691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Gels were imaged using a UMax PowerLook 1000 scanner. The percentage of N-terminal cleavage is described by ((M)/(M + MIH)) × 100 in which M is the amount of N-terminal product of the N-terminal cleavage reaction, and MIH is the amount of non-cleaved precursor protein, each determined by densitometry using NIH ImageJ and corrected for relative molecular mass. Similarly, the percentage of C-terminal cleavage is described by ((NI)/(NI + NIH)) ×100 in which NI is the N-terminal product of C-terminal cleavage of the precursor protein NIH (see Fig. 2).Rate constants of N-terminal cleavage assume a pseudo first order rate constant calculated from the slopes of plots of ln (1–((M)/(M + MIH))) versus time in seconds. Rate constants of C-terminal cleavage assume a first order rate constant calculated from the slopes of plots of ln (1–((NI)/(NI + NIH))) versus time in seconds. Each data point for the percentage of N- or C-terminal cleavage or the calculation of rate constants is the average of two separate experiments.MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data were obtained at the University of Massachusetts Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility (Worcester, MA). C1AWT and C1AQN were subjected to C-terminal cleavage conditions described above for 18 h and analyzed using a Micromass linear/reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry system.RESULTSAnalysis of N-terminal Cleavage—We were able to isolate proteins consisting of an in-frame fusion of E. coli maltose-binding protein with the seven C-terminal residues of the P. abyssi PolII N-extein and the 185 residues of the intein, fused to the six N-terminal residues of the C-extein and a hexahistidine tag. The sequence at the N- and C-terminal splice junctions of these proteins is presented schematically in Fig. 2A. Proteins QA and QACA were purified at room temperature using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and a single band corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of 66.6 kDa was observed for each protein (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3).Fig. 3SDS-PAGE analysis of N-terminal cleavage of QA and QACA.

In vitro N-terminal cleavage results in the predicted conversion of the 66.6-kDa precursor protein, MIH, to the cleaved N-terminal extein, M (43.7 kDa), and the intein-C-extein fusion, IH (22.9 kDa). The identity of these bands was verified by Western blot (data not shown). As expected, the protein bands corresponding to the precursor MIH and intein-C-extein fusion IH react with an anti-His-tag antibody, and the protein band corresponding to the N-extein, M, does not.Time Course of N-terminal Cleavage—To determine the pseudo first order rate constants for DTT-dependent N-terminal cleavage of the fusion proteins QA, QACA, and QNHA, the proteins were incubated at 60 °C for 12 h under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” and aliquots of the reaction were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE buffer at seven time points and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The pseudo first order rate constants were calculated using data from two trials over the first 6 h of the reaction and are reported in Table II.

In the absence of DTT, the pseudo first order rate constant of N-terminal cleavage of QNHA was 1.6 × 10–5 s–1, whereas in the presence of 25 mm DTT the pseudo first order rate constant was 1.0 × 10–4 s–1. Similar rate constants for QNHA were obtained using both 50 and 100 mm DTT. Pseudo first order rate constants measured in the absence of DTT were 2.0 × 10–5 s–1 for QA and 2.4 × 10–5 s–1 for QACA.Dependence of N-terminal Cleavage on pH—For QA, QACA, and QNHA, N-terminal cleavage is inefficient below a pH of 6.5 (Fig. 5). The maximum extent of N-terminal cleavage occurs around between pH 7 and 7.5 for QA and QACA and around pH 8 for QNHA. The extent of N-terminal cleavage greatly decreases at pH values approaching pH 9.Fig. 5pH dependence of N-terminal cleavage of QA, QACA, and QNHA. The effect of pH on N-terminal cleavage of QA (▪), QACA (•), and QNHA (□) was examined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The value for percent N-terminal cleavage is the average of two trials, and the pH values are as determined for the reaction mixture at 23 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of C-terminal Cleavage—We were able to isolate proteins consisting of an in-frame fusion of the N-terminal sequence MKL with the four C-terminal residues of the N-extein, the 185 residues of the intein (with a C1A mutation), the six N-terminal residues of the C-extein, and a hexahistidine tag.

Proteins C1AWT, C1AQN, C1AHA, and C1AQNHA were purified at room temperature using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and a single band corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of 23.9 kDa was observed for each protein (Fig. 6, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7).Fig. 6SDS-PAGE analysis of C-terminal cleavage of C1AWT, C1AQN, C1AHA, and C1AQNHA. Lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7 consist of ∼0.6 μg of C1AWT, C1AQN, C1AHA, and C1AQNHA, respectively.

In vitro C-terminal cleavage results in the predicted conversion of the 23.9-kDa precursor protein, NIH, to the cleaved N-extein-intein fusion, NI (22.4 kDa). The cleaved C-extein would be too small to observe on the gel.The identity of these protein bands was verified by Western blot (data not shown). As expected, the protein band corresponding to the precursor NIH reacts with an anti-His-tag antibody, but the protein band corresponding to the N-terminal product of C-terminal cleavage, NI, does not react with the antibody.MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was also used to identify the products of C-terminal cleavage of C1AWT and C1AQN. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of purified C1AWT and C1AQN resulted in peaks with m/z of 23,859 and 23,839, respectively, which is consistent with the predicted molecular masses of 23,876 Da and 23,862 Da. An analysis of a C-terminal cleavage reaction mixture of C1AWT at 60 °C for 18 h revealed two major peaks with m/z of 23,860 and 22,416, consistent with the predicted molecular masses of NIH (23,876 Da) and NI (22,418). Analysis of a C-terminal cleavage reaction mixture for C1AQN at 60 °C for 18 h revealed one major peak with m/z of 22,393, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of NI (22,404).C1AQN cleaves nearly to completion (93%) at 60 °C in 18 h, whereas C1AWT cleaves to ∼59%. The cleavage of QNHA proceeds to ∼15%, whereas cleavage of HA is barely detectable (∼2%).Time Course of C-terminal Cleavage—To determine the first order rate constants for C-terminal cleavage of the fusion proteins C1AWT, C1AQN, and C1AQNHA, the proteins were incubated at 60 °C under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” and aliquots of the reaction were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE buffer at the appropriate time points and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The first order rate constants were calculated using data from two trials over the first 60 min of the reaction for C1AQN, 18 h for C1AWT, and 24 h for C1AQNHA and are reported in Table III.Table IIIRate constants for C-terminal cleavageC-terminal cleavageks-1C1AWT1.2 × 10-5C1AQN2.8 × 10-4C1AQNHA2.9 × 10-6 Open table in a new tab Dependence of C-terminal Cleavage on pH—For C1AWT, C1AQN, and C1AQNHA, C-terminal cleavage is optimal below pH 7.5, and the extent of cleavage decreases significantly at higher pH values (Fig. 7).Fig. 7pH dependence of C-terminal cleavage of C1AWT, C1AQN, and C1AQNHA.

We discovered that the Pab PolII intein, which has a C-terminal Gln, can facilitate protein splicing with a rate of 9.3 × 10–6 s–1 at 60 °C and that this rate increases to 3.4 × 10–5 s–1 upon the substitution of Asn for the C-terminal Gln (2Mills K.V.

We also showed that substitution of the penultimate residue, a highly conserved His, of the Pab PolII intein with Ala results in N-terminal cleavage in place of protein splicing (Fig. 1, step 7) (2Mills K.V. Manning J.S. Garcia A.M. Wuerdeman L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20685-20691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this report, we took further advantage of the temperature-inducible activity of the Pab PolII intein to study the kinetics of protein splicing, the first such study of an intein that naturally splices in cis.Mutation of the C-terminal Gln of the intein to Ala (Fig. 2, fusion protein QA) results in temperature-dependent N-terminal cleavage (Fig. 1, step 7) in place of splicing, as does a double mutation of both the C-terminal Gln of the intein and the N-terminal Cys of the C-extein to Ala (Fig. 2, fusion protein QACA) (Fig. 3). Similar N-terminal cleavage was previously shown for fusion protein QNHA (2Mills K.V. Manning J.S. Garcia A.M. Wuerdeman L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20685-20691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The rates of DTT-dependent N-terminal cleavage at 60 °C for each of these constructs are very similar (Table II). For QACA, thiol-induced N-terminal cleavage of the linear ester formed in step 1 of splicing is likely, as step 2 is blocked by the Cys + Ala-1 substitution (Fig. 1). For QA, thiol-induced N-terminal cleavage could be the result of a nucleophilic attack on either the linear or branched ester. The fact that the rates of these cleavage reactions are so similar suggests either that the transesterification reaction is rapidly reversible with respect to formation of the linear ester, or that the cleavage of QA is primarily due to a nucleophilic attack on the linear ester. A definitive conclusion awaits the isolation of mutations that allow us to purify the branched intermediate and compare the rates of N-terminal cleavage of the linear and branched esters.The rate of DTT-induced N-terminal cleavage is 3–10 times faster than that for the overall splicing reaction (Tables I and II), which is similar to the results observed with the trans-splicing Ssp DnaE intein, in which N-terminal trans-cleavage at 23 °C is 15–24 times faster than trans-splicing (9Nichols N.M. Benner J.S. Martin D.D. Evans Jr., T.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Martin D.D. Xu M.Q. Evans Jr., T.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our previously reported rate constants for N-terminal cleavage of fusion proteins QNHA, HA, and CA were for hydrolytic N-terminal cleavage and therefore a measurement of both ester formation and hydrolysis. The DTT-dependent rate constants reported here are relatively constant at 25, 50, and 100 mm concentrations of DTT and are a better gauge of the first order rate constant of thioester formation.Table IRate constants for protein splicing, as reported in Ref. 2Mills K.V.

https://openalex.org/W2000749908,"RuvA plays an essential role in branch migration of the Holliday junction by RuvAB as part of the RuvABC pathway for processing Holliday junctions in Escherichia coli. Two types of RuvA-Holliday junction complexes have been characterized: 1) complex I containing a single RuvA tetramer and 2) complex II in which the junction is sandwiched between two RuvA tetramers. The functional differences between the two forms are still not clear. To investigate the role of RuvA octamerization, we introduced three amino acid substitutions designed to disrupt the E. coli RuvA tetramer-tetramer interface as identified by structural studies. The mutant RuvA was tetrameric and interacted with both RuvB and junction DNA but, as predicted, formed complex I only at protein concentrations up to 500 nm. We present biochemical and surface plasmon resonance evidence for functional and physical interactions of the mutant RuvA with RuvB and RuvC on synthetic junctions. The mutant RuvA with RuvB showed DNA helicase activity and could support branch migration of synthetic four-way and three-way junctions. However, junction binding and the efficiency of branch migration of four-way junctions were affected. The activity of the RuvA mutant was consistent with a RuvAB complex driven by one RuvB hexamer only and lead us to propose that one RuvA tetramer can only support the activity of one RuvB hexamer. Significantly, the mutant failed to complement the UV sensitivity of E. coli DeltaruvA cells. These results indicate strongly that RuvA octamerization is essential for the full biological activity of RuvABC."

Although many mechanisms contribute to regulation of PKA signaling, members of the endogenous protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) family may be particularly important for terminating nuclear PKA activity and gene expression. Here we used both siRNA and antisense knockdown strategies to examine PKA signaling activated by parathyroid hormone or the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. We found that endogenous PKIγ is required for efficient termination of nuclear PKA activity, transcription factor phosphorylation, and immediate-early genes. Moreover, PKIγ is required for export of PKA catalytic subunits from the nucleus back to the cytoplasm following activation of PKA signaling because this is also inhibited by PKIγ knockdown. Leptomycin B blocks PKA nuclear export but has little or no effect on nuclear PKA activity or immediate-early gene expression. Thus, inactivation of PKA activity in the nucleus is sufficient to terminate signaling, and nuclear export is not required. These results were the first in any cell type showing that endogenous levels of PKI regulate PKA signaling.

These immediate-early genes are induced in response to PTH by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of transcription factors, such as CREB and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (3Chen X. Dai J.C.

Because these immediate-early genes mediate both the catabolic and anabolic effects of PTH (9Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene. 2002; 282: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), elucidation of the regulation of expression of these genes will substantially increase our understanding of the mechanism responsible for fine-tuning the balance between the catabolic and anabolic effects.Transient regulation of gene transcription is most likely due to termination of one or more step(s) in the relevant signal transduction pathway. Consistent with this, multiple mechanisms contribute to precise regulation of both PKA signaling and the changes in gene expression induced by this signaling pathway (1Montminy M. Annu. Rev.

Those studies demonstrate that the primary mechanism responsible for termination of immediate-early gene expression acts downstream of receptor desensitization, adenylyl cyclase activation, and cAMP degradation (3Chen X. Dai J.C. Greenfield E.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1432-C1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

We have focused on inactivation of PKA because it is the only one of these mechanisms that could account not only for termination of immediate-early gene transcription but also for the termination of both PKA activity and transcription factor phosphorylation that occur following activation of PKA signaling (3Chen X.

Physiol. 2002; 283: C1432-C1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).In the cytoplasm, activity of the catalytic subunit of PKA is terminated in response to reduced cAMP levels by its reassociation with regulatory subunits to form an inactive holoenzyme composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits (11Walsh D.A.

Muchinsky S. Narula A. Burton K.A. McKnight G.S. Uhler M.D. Idzerda R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3442-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Belyamani M. Gangolli E.A. Idzerda R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3959-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This result appears to be because of compensation by increased expression of other PKI family members and/or the regulatory subunits of PKA (30Gangolli E.A. Belyamani M. Muchinsky S. Narula A. Burton K.A. McKnight G.S. Uhler M.D. Idzerda R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3442-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotide studies have implicated PKIα in regulation of synaptic activity in the rat hippocampus (32Lecea L.D. Criado J. Rivera S. Wen W. Soriano E. Henriksen S. Taylor S. Gall C. Sutcliffe J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and in development of left-right asymmetry in chick embryos (33Kawakami M. Nakanishi N. Development. 2001; 128: 2509-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we used both siRNA and antisense knockdown strategies to examine the role of PKIγ in PKA signaling activated by PTH or ISO. We found that endogenous PKIγ was required for efficient termination of immediate-early gene expression following activation of PKA signaling. Endogenous PKIγ was also required for export of PKA catalytic subunits from the nucleus back to the cytoplasm. However, inactivation of PKA in the nucleus by endogenous PKIγ was sufficient to terminate signaling, and nuclear export was not required. These results were the first in any cell type showing that endogenous levels of PKI regulate PKA signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—All cell culture media, supplements, and stimulators were screened for endotoxin contamination using the high sensitivity version of the colorimetric Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000; Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) as described previously (34Ragab A.A.

Endotoxin levels were <0.004 endotoxin units/ml for the concentration of each stimulator used in the experiments. Rat ROS 17/2.8 osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells (35Majeska R.J. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells (36Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar), and murine NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells (ATCC CRL 1658) were maintained as described previously (3Chen X. Dai J.C. Greenfield E.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1432-C1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 and routinely passaged every 3 or 4 days.siRNA Experiments—Rat PKIγ cDNA from ROS 17/2.8 cells was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-GAAGAGATGCAGGCAGGA-3′ and 5′-AGAGGTACAGCAGGTCTC-3′) based on the murine sequence (GenBank™ accession code U97170). PCR products were sequenced and the rat PKIγ sequence was deposited in GenBank™ (accession code AY150308). Five siRNA target sequences directed against the rat PKIγ coding region were selected following the recommendations of Tuschl and co-workers (37Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). All of these targets therefore are 21 nucleotides in length, are preceded by 5′-AA, avoid the first 100 nucleotides of the coding region, contain ∼50% G/C content, and contain at least three nucleotide mismatches with all other sequences in the data base. siRNA duplexes directed at each PKIγ target were prepared by in vitro transcription. siRNA duplexes targeting firefly luciferase were also prepared for use as controls as recommended (37Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 38Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J.

In vitro transcription was performed using the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion, TX) and sense and antisense oligonucleotides obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA).For transfection of siRNA duplexes, ROS 17/2.8 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/cm2 in F-12 nutrient mixture (Ham's F-12 medium) (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) without antibiotics. Four different transfection reagents, including siPORT amine and siPORT lipid (Ambion, Austin, TX), FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), were tested during screening experiments. The most profound knockdown of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was achieved with Lipofectamine 2000 (data not shown). This reagent was therefore used for all further siRNA transfections. For this purpose, ROS 17/2.8 cells were incubated at 37 °C with 30 nm siRNA duplexes and 2.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in a total volume of 800 μlof serum-free OPTI-MEM I medium (Invitrogen)/well. After 4 h, 800 μl of Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics were added to each well. After culture for another 20 h, the cells were incubated with 100 nm bPTH (1Montminy M.

Research on factors influencing molecular recognition is an area of vibrant activity. The molecular basis of specificity for antigen-antibody recognition can involve numerous factors and is not limited to the primary amino acid sequence of the antigenic epitope. The epitope can have a complex structural component in the context of the entire tertiary structure of the antigen. In such a case, an analogous linear variant of the original antigen, for instance, a short peptide, would not be expected to retain much structural information, particularly in the absence of any disulfide bridges. However, antibodies that can recognize short peptides that appear to adopt a defined conformation have previously been described (3Choulier L. Rauffer-Bruyere N. Ben Khalifa M. Martin F. Vernet T. Altschuh D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3530-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Calvo J.C. Choconta K.C. Diaz D. Orozco O. Bravo M.M. Espejo F. Salazar L.M. Guzman F. Patarroyo M.E. J. Med.

Although the antibody was raised against the denatured β subunit, it appears to recognize a conformational epitope present in the native α-β heterodimer, which becomes unavailable upon peptide binding (1Carven G.J.

Preliminary characterization has mapped the epitope to residues 50–67 of the β subunit, with residues Leu-53, Asp-57, Tyr-60, Trp-61, Ser-63, and Leu-67 being essential for binding. To assess the individual contributions of nonessential residues to binding, we used SpotMatrix SPR 1The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RCU, resonance change units; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; SSCP, Secondary Structural Content Prediction.1The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RCU, resonance change units; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; SSCP, Secondary Structural Content Prediction. to obtain a comparative kinetic analysis for alanine mutants spanning residues 50–67 of the epitope. The application of SpotMatrix SPR for the affinity characterization of monoclonal antibodies in the context of epitope mapping is described here. In this approach, biotinylated peptides are spotted at a range of concentrations onto a specific capture surface to be enclosed into a single flow cell. The entire SpotMatrix of peptides can then be simultaneously interrogated against a specific analyte in a single experiment by surface plasmon resonance to obtain side-by-side comparative binding kinetics (see “Experimental Procedures”). Peptide epitope mapping by imaging SPR has been described previously in a lower density format for the monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody and FLAG epitope (5Wegner G.J. Lee H.J. Corn R.M. Anal.

Relative binding and kinetic rate differences between parent and mutant peptides were simultaneously assessed using the SpotMatrix SPR technology. Certain unique structure-activity inferences emerged that provide further support for the hypothesis that MEM-265 recognizes an epitope that is contained within the secondary structure of an α-helix. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides carrying N-terminal biotin tags were prepared as described previously (1Carven G.J. Chitta S. Hilgert I. Rushe M.M. Baggio R.F. Palmer M. Arenas J.E.

Briefly, the peptides were synthesized in-house using standard N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid phase chemistry and were biotinylated while still bound to the solid phase, using biotin-LC-LC-NHS ester (succinimdyl-6′-(biotinamido)-6-hexanamido hexanoate; Pierce) to modify the N-terminal amino group, before conventional deprotection and isolation by reverse-phase HPLC. Purity was determined by analytical HPLC and mass spectrometry.

The MEM-265 hybridoma was originally prepared after immunization of mice with purified, insoluble DR1 β-chain (DRB1*0101) expressed in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies and screening of hybridomas for the ability to distinguish empty DR1 from hemagglutinin peptide loaded DR1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MEM-265 is one of four similar antibodies thus identified (1Carven G.J. Chitta S. Hilgert I. Rushe M.M. Baggio R.F. Palmer M. Arenas J.E. Strominger J.L. Horejsi V. Santambrogio L. Stern L.J. J.

Binding Kinetics by SpotMatrix Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding kinetics were measured using a FLEX CHIP Kinetic Analysis System (HTS Biosystems, East Hartford, CT) that uses grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance technology for parallel measurement of real time binding kinetics between unlabeled analytes and up to 400 target biomolecules immobilized (spotted) on an affinity chip to form a SpotMatrix. Surface plasmon resonance occurs when light, under particular conditions, is reflected off of certain thin metal films such as gold. When the energy state of the incoming photons matches the energy modes of the delocalized metal surface electrons (the plasmons), energy is transferred to the surface. This energy transfer is recorded as a decrease in the intensity of the reflected light. The incident light angle at which this energy transfer is most efficient, the SPR angle, is very sensitive to changes in chemistry at the surface including refractive index and mass changes. Typically, the coupling of incident light with the surface plasmons is accomplished using a prism. In the present configuration, the coupling is achieved by way of a surface grating (Fig. 1), (6Wood R.W. Phil. Magm. 1902; 4: 396-402Crossref Google Scholar, 7Cullen D.C. Brown R.G. Lowe C.R.

With the present system, the ligands are immobilized by spotting them onto the 1-cm2 grated chip surface (see Fig. 2A@@@ ). Binding events for each of the spotted ligands are subsequently monitored simultaneously and in parallel.Fig. 2Representative affinity traces for MEM-265 simultaneously interacting with all D66A peptide spotted in triplicate at various concentrations.

Only initial dissociation rates were used for data analysis to reduce the contribution from antibody bound bivalently.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Spotting of Biotinylated Peptides on SPR Affinity Chips—Both streptavidin affinity chips and NeutrAvidin™ affinity chips from HTS Biosystems were used for immobilization of peptides (NeutrAvidin is a trademark of Pierce). Biotinylated peptides in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and PBS blanks were spotted using an SMP10B pin (Telechem) on a MicroSys spotter (Cartesian Dispensing Systems, presently Genomic Solutions) at concentrations of 1, 2, and 3 μm in PBS. Surface saturation of the spotted area has experimentally been found to occur when spotting biotinylated peptide solution at concentrations of 10–20 μm (data not shown). The peptides were spotted at a low concentration, such that they still generated a measurable binding signal with the lowest possible surface density to minimize potential MEM-265 rebinding. In this system (data not shown), and in previously reported SPR analyses, high ligand surface density aggravates avidity and analyte-rebinding effects (10Shinohara Y. Hasegawa Y. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Lower surface density is expected to minimize avidity effects caused by binding of bivalent antibody molecules to two immobilized antigen molecules. Each spot had an approximate diameter of 330–360 μm and a volume of 2.5 nl/spot. Nine spots (three for each peptide concentration used) were assigned for each of the 18 peptides, thereby creating a matrix of 162 individually immobilized ligands. Eighteen blank control spots rounded out the 12 × 15 SpotMatrix (180 spotted features in total). Multiple copies of each chip were made and tested. Kinetic Runs—For each of the 162 immobilized peptide spots, a set of four independent reference areas immediately surrounding each spot were assigned to obtain local referencing for binding. Reference areas are located in the spaces between peptide spots and correspond to surface where no sample has been spotted. Following chip equilibration for 1 h in PBST (10 mm sodium phosphate, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, 2.5 ml of monoclonal antibody MEM-265, 25 nm in PBST, was flowed over the SpotMatrix at 25 °C and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 30 min using recirculation. The prolonged association time allowed the interaction of MEM-265 to come to equilibrium with all of peptides, spotted at various densities. Data points (resonance change units (RCU) as a function of time) were taken every 7.4 s. One RCU corresponds to a 1-millidegree change in SPR angle. Dissociation was monitored over a period of 30 min. Kinetic Analysis—A two-compartment model (11Myszka D.G. Morton M. Doyle L. Chaiken I.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) is used to describe the interaction between an analyte (A) and an immobilized ligand (B) in Equation 1. Ao↔kmA+B⇄koffkonAB(Eq. 1) The model describes the diffusion limitation (km) for analyte from bulk solution (Ao) to the chip surface. Analyte at the surface (A) can interact with immobilized ligand (B) with an association rate (kon) and a dissociation rate (koff). For a given peptide (B) spotted at various densities and antibody (A), kinetic binding analysis was performed by globally fitting the specified affinity traces of the given peptide to analytical solutions for the following binding equation. d[AB]dt=kon(km[Ao]+koff[AB]km+kon[B])[B]−koff[AB] Given that the amount of free ligand [B] at any particular time can be described as the amount of total ligand at the surface [Btotal] minus ligand bound with analyte [AB], [B] can be substituted by [Btotal] – [AB]. Furthermore, the SPR response signal, R, is proportional to complex [AB] by a certain constant, C, so that R = C[AB]. When [Btotal] is fully bound by analyte, [Btotal] = [AB] and R = Rmax, the maximum SPR response signal. Substituting these equivalencies into the above equation gives rise to the following equation. d[R]dt=kon(Rmax−R)[km[Ao]C+koffRkmC+kon(Rmax−R)]−koffR The analytical solutions for both association and dissociation phases (12Sigmundsson K. Másson G. Rice R. Beauchemin N. Obrink B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8263-8276Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), based on quasi-steady state approximation of the two-compartment model were employed in the algorithm, part of FLEX CHIP kinetic analysis system data analysis 4.1.3 software. The algorithm fits all of the affinity traces for a given peptide concurrently and reports a single kon and koff term for the entire group. The algorithm applies a correction for mass transport limited kinetics. The mass transport rate constant (km) and Rmax values are fit independently for each curve in the group. The conditions used for the present analysis used low, subsaturating densities of spotted peptides (1–3 μm used, saturation at 10–20 μm) and sought to take into account initial dissociation rates to reduce the contribution of bivalent binding of the monoclonal antibody to the immobilized peptides. Residual (data fit) maps for all data points of the analyzed data sets defined the extent of error at different time points between experimental data and theoretical model. Association was evaluated for 30 min, and dissociation was evaluated over a period of 3–4 min to minimize any antibody rebinding effects because of the antibody bivalence. Plots of residuals and χ2 values were used to judge data quality. Residual plots depict the difference between experimental data and theoretical data for each time point of the binding event. The χ2 value represents the average of the squared residual values. Peptide Structure Prediction—Secondary structural prediction for wild type and mutant peptides was performed using method 1 of the Secondary Structural Content Prediction (SSCP) (13Eisenhaber F. Imperiale F. Argos P. Froemmel C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Design. 1996; 25: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Eisenhaber F. Froemmel C. Argos P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Design. 1996; 25: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), version 2.0 software of Eisenhaber and Imperiale (www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/SSCP/sscp_seq.html). Method 1 relies on the average amino acid composition of secondary structural elements in a defined set of proteins. SSCP predicts the tendency of a linear sequence in the context of a protein to assume a secondary structure. Secondary structural prediction was also performed using the prediction algorithm AGADIR (15Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) (www.embl-heidelberg.de/Services/serrano/agadir/agadir-start.html). AGADIR predicts the helical propensity of peptides free in solution. Kinetic Analysis of Alanine Scan Epitope Peptides—Peptide D66A at nine concentrations of 1, 2, and 3 μm was spotted in triplicate forming a group of nine spots. In Fig. 2B, a graphic representation of the 12 × 15 matrix highlights the relative positions of the nine spots forming the peptide group D66A. The affinity traces generated by this group upon binding MEM-265 (25 nm) are shown in Fig. 2C. During the hour-long chip equilibration, the first 60 min of the kinetic run, minimal drift was observed as noted by the flat base line. The three sets of triplicate affinity traces form three distinct groups with Rmax values of ∼2, 10, and 20 RCUs for D66A peptide spotted concentrations of 1, 2, and 3 μm, respectively. The affinity traces represent reference corrected data where, for each time point, the average value of the four reference areas surrounding a peptide spot was subtracted from the RCU value for the particular spot. Reference areas are located in the spaces between peptide spots and correspond to surface areas where no sample has been spotted (not shown). Kinetic analysis of the D66A peptide group began by auto-zeroing the nine affinity traces at the 57-min time point. The association period for analyte MEM-265 was from the 60-min time point to the 90-min time point, whereas the dissociation phase was analyzed from the 90-min time point to the 94-min time point. Affinity traces were globally fitted with mass transport correction, and the resulting theoretical traces are shown overlaid on the experimental affinity traces (Fig. 3A). The degree to which experimental and theoretical affinity traces correlate at each time point is shown in the residual graph (Fig. 3B). A tight correlation was observed, indicating that for binding of MEM-265 to immobilized D66A peptide, monitored under this particular set of conditions, a simple 1:1 binding model was sufficient to describe the interaction. Kinetic rates and equilibrium constants were simultaneously and globally calculated for the D66A group affinity traces, (Table II). Peptide spotted at higher concentrations (2–3 μm) required a smaller km term, indicating that diffusion of analyte MEM-265 to the surface was more rate-limiting when peptide was spotted at higher concentrations.Table IIKinetic parameters for MEM-265 binding to immobilized D66A peptideSpot ID (concentration)kmRmax (RCU)χ2kon × 105 m-1 s-1koff × 10-3 s-1KA × 108 m-1KD × 10-9 mD66A (1 μm)1.72 × 10142.40.08D66A (1 μm)1.01 × 10152.30.08D66A (1 μm)1.09 × 10132.10.09D66A (2 μm)1.31 × 10410.20.13D66A (2 μm)1.92 × 10139.70.124.111.782.324.32D66A (2 μm)9.85 × 1039.30.13D66A (3 μm)1.33 × 10423.60.23D66A (3 μm)1.21 × 10421.20.18D66A (3 μm)1.10 × 10420.80.22 Open table in a new tab As described above for D66A peptide group, a similar analysis was carried out for the rest of the peptide groups. High SPR binding signals (10–30 RCU) were obtained for MEM-265 (25 nm) binding to peptides wild type, V50A, T51A, E52A, G54A, R55A, P56A, E59A, N62A, Q64A, K65A, and D66A. A weak SPR signal (3 RCU) was observed for MEM-265 binding to W61A. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, MEM-265 did not bind to L53A, D57A, Y60A, S63A, and L67A. These results are consistent with previous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results, which identified Leu-53, Asp-57, Tyr-60, Trp-61, Ser-63, and Leu-67 as constituting the most critical residues for MEM-265 recognition. The SPR results reported here were obtained by spotting the biotinylated peptides on a NeutrAvidin™ affinity chip. Results on a streptavidin affinity chip were similar and showed the same overall trends but somewhat lower RCU values (data not shown), indicating a very limited role, if any, for a particular surface biasing the present data set. Alanine Substitution of Nonessential Epitope Residues Primarily Affects Off Rates—Kinetic constants were calculated for each mutant peptide, and the data were analyzed as described above. The results, summarized in Table III, show that although the measured kon rates for various peptides varied only 2.7-fold ranging from 1.59 × 105 m–1 s–1, the koff rates varied over a much larger 48-fold range between 0.89 × 10–9 s–1 and 42.9 × 10–9 s–1. The ranges of χ2 values for globally analyzed data sets corresponding to the various peptides are also listed in Table III. The quality of data fit was good with all of the values coming in below 1. To facilitate comparative analysis of kinetic parameters, kon, koff, and KD, for a series of multiple ligand interactions with an analyte, we utilized log kon versus log koff plots, which also depict KD and are often used in this regard (Fig. 4). For the 12 peptides carrying mutations on residues that were not essential for MEM-265 binding, the log (kon) versus log (koff) kinetic parameter plot clearly shows that the alanine scan mutations preferentially affect the dissociation rate without exhibiting much of an affect on the association rate. Mutations E52A and Q64A exhibited partial detrimental effects on MEM-265 binding, indicating that residues Glu-52 and Gln-64 are not critical for binding. Mutations G54A and P56A enhanced MEM-265 affinity relative to wild type.Table IIIKinetic parameters: kon, koff, and KD valuesIDkon × 105 m-1 s-1koff × 10-4 s-1KD × 10-9 mχ2WT2.745.752.100.14-0.23V50A3.2115.104.690.09-0.20T51A4.2815.803.680.12-0.16E52A3.2242.9013.300.11-0.42L53ANBNBNBG54A2.600.890.340.45-0.71R55A3.717.722.080.09-0.48P56A2.531.620.640.31-0.93D57ANBNBNBE59A1.591.891.190.44-0.95Y60ANBNBNBW61AWBWBWBN62A1.685.263.130.25-0.81S63ANBNBNBQ64A3.3036.3011.000.10-0.32K65A2.833.471.220.37-0.60D66A4.1117.804.320.08-0.23L67ANBNBNB Open table in a new tab The dissociation rates of MEM-265 for E52A and Q64A relative to wild type increased ∼8-fold, whereas the dissociation rates of MEM-265 for G54A and P56A relative to wild type decreased six and 4-fold, respectively. In each case, the apparent association rates for all of these peptides were relatively unchanged, and the effects of mutation on the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, are essentially due to alterations of the dissociation rates. An overlay of MEM-265 affinity traces for E52A and P56A peptides spotted at comparable densities and eliciting similar Rmax values graphically illustrates that specificity is primarily due to dissociation rate differences (Fig. 5). Correlation between Epitope Helical Propensities and Kinetic Parameters—G54A and P56A were the substitutions that provided the greatest increase in affinity and decrease in dissociation rate. Both glycine and proline within the context of an α-helical segment are generally considered to be destabilizing (16Yang J. Spek E.J. Gong Y. Zhou H. Kallenbach N.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Substitution of these helical destabilizing residues with alanine, which is generally considered to be stabilizing for α-helices, had an enhancing effect on the affinities of mutant peptides for MEM-265. To better ascertain the possible structural influence of alanine substitutions on kinetic parameters of MEM-265 binding, the degree of predicted helical propensity of the various peptides was plotted as a function of the log of the kinetic rates (Fig. 6). Two algorithms were used to predict the helical tendencies of the peptide set: SSCP (13Eisenhaber F. Imperiale F. Argos P. Froemmel C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Design. 1996; 25: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Eisenhaber F. Froemmel C. Argos P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Design. 1996; 25: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, A and B) and AGADIR (15Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, C and D). Whereas SSCP uses a protein set to make a prediction of secondary structure, AGADIR predicts the tendency of the peptide, free in solution, to be helical. In the present case, however, neither algorithm may adequately model the helical tendencies of peptides immobilized at one end. For both algorithms, no correlation was observed between the association rate and helical propensity. When AGADIR values for the peptides were compared with the corresponding dissociation rates, no clear tendency emerged because these short peptides free in solution are not predicted be helical to any considerable percentage. All of the predicted values for helical propensity of peptides in solution were below 2%. An inverse correlation was, however, observed where peptides with a higher SSCP helical propensity tended to have slower dissociation rates, suggesting the formation of a more stable antigen-antibody complex. The present SPR screening analysis of the MEM-265 epitope represented by residues 50–67 of the MHC II DR1 β-chain provides a very high resolution snapshot of the extent and mode by which certain residues contribute to the molecular recognition event. Not only were the critical epitope residues Leu-53, Asp-57, Tyr-60, Trp-61, Ser-63, and Leu-67 (group 1) identified, but also additional distinct contributing groups were highlighted. Alanine substitutions at positions Glu-52 and Gln-64 (group 2) had a significant detrimental effect and negatively impacted affinity by increasing the dissociation rate. Alanine substitutions at positions Val-50, Thr-51, Arg-55, Glu-59, Asn-62, and Lys-65 (group 3) did not exhibit a substantial impact upon MEM-265 kinetic parameters in the present study. Of particular interest, alanine substitutions at Gly-54 and Pro-56 (group 4) had a beneficial effect on MEM-265 recognition, exhibited by a decrease in the dissociation rate. A previous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based study only distinguished critical residues from noncritical residues. The two additional groups identified by SpotMatrix SPR, group 2 and group 4 may affect MEM-265 dissociation rates through a more subtle indirect effect on the positioning of the critical group 1 residues. The residues in both group 2 and group 4 are located immediately adjacent to critical residues. Group 2 residues may assist by sterically positioning group 1 residues in conformationally restricted positions, which are favorable for MEM-265 binding. By the same reasoning, group 4 residues may exact a considerable conformational cost for their neighboring critical residues. Whereas glycine at position 54 allows for too much conformational freedom, proline at position 56 may restrict the conformational freedom of neighboring residues, such as Leu-53 (Fig. 7), to positions that would not be optimal for complete antigenic variant peptide-antibody recognition. In the context of the fact that the critical residues of the MEM-265 epitope are spaced appropriately to reside on a contiguous face of an α-helix and of the fact that residues 50–67 in the folded MHC II DR1 β-chain structure are part of a helix, the kinetics provided for these mutations further support the possibility that MEM-265 recognizes an epitope that is most easily displayed on an α-helix. In the case of group 4 residues, alanine substitution is expected to be far more stabilizing for a helix than either of the native residues (16Yang J. Spek E.J. Gong Y. Zhou H. Kallenbach N.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Indeed helical stabilizing effects of alanine or alanine substitutions have been observed in both well studied proteins and peptides, such as leucyl-tRNA synthetase (18Chen J.F. Li T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), T4 lysozyme (19Dao-Pin S. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. Proteins. 1990; 7: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Zhang X.J. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2012-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Heinz D.W.

Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 761-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and melittin (23Dempsey C.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4705-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Locking the antigenic variant peptide into a conformation that most mimics the conformation of the epitope in the original antigen would be expected to slow down the dissociation rate. The finding that only the dissociation rates and not the association rates were affected for group 4 mutants suggests that the antigenic variant peptide epitope for MEM-265 adopts a helix upon complex formation and is largely unstructured in solution. The free peptides are not predicted to be helical in solution (AGADIR predictions). This is consistent with circular dichroism analysis, which indicated that all peptides used in this study exhibited spectra typical of random coil conformations (data not shown). In the context of a protein, however, the sequences of the antigenic variants are expected to have varying degrees of helical character (SSCP predictions). A helix-destabilizing residue, however, in the absence of any immediate stabilizing interactions from its neighboring residues, should increase the dissociation rate. In the case of Glu-52 of group 2, such a scenario may be occurring. Although the substitution of an alanine at Glu-52 is predicted to be more helix stabilizing, the crystal structure of MHC II DR1 reveals that the β-chain residue Glu-52 is within salt bridge distance (<3.0 Å) of Arg-55. The benefit of an Glu-52–Arg-55 salt bridge to helicity may outweigh any positive contribution in this regard offered by E52A. A previously characterized monoclonal antibody raised against tobacco mosaic virus protein was strongly suspected of binding to an epitope displayed on a contiguous face of an α-helix (24Altschuh D. Dubs M.C. Weiss E. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6298-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this particular case, further characterization by alanine scanning and SPR of the antigenic variant peptide corresponding to the original antigen epitope suggested that alanine substitution of a particular glutamic acid, presumably involved in a salt bridge with a vicinal arginine, may affect peptide recognition by stabilizing a conformation that is advantageous to antibody binding (3Choulier L. Rauffer-Bruyere N. Ben Khalifa M. Martin F. Vernet T. Altschuh D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3530-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Altschuh D. Dubs M.C. Weiss E. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6298-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The SpotMatrix SPR fine epitope mapping technique described here provides an excellent means to dissect and understand multiple molecular interactions simultaneously. Assessment of the relative contributions of different residues can be performed at the kinetic level. A more complete and refined understanding of the determinants involved in molecular recognition and specificity can be rapidly and thoroughly derived in a manner that minimizes experimental variability by allowing highly parallel measurement of all variants on a single experiment. In addition, a detailed comparative assessment of the association and dissociation rates for a panel of ligands can indicate a structural aspect of molecular recognition exiting between the ligand and analyte. In the present study, an evaluation of the kinetic parameters for the interaction of monoclonal antibody MEM-265 with antigenic variant peptides provided evidence for a model of peptide-antibody recognition reminiscent of an induced fit model (26Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sundberg E.J. Mariuzza R.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 119-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).

In this study, we showed that ERK-2/MAPK is associated with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) virions and regulated the nuclear transport of Vpx and virus replication in non-proliferating target cells by phosphorylating Vpx. Suppression of the virion-associated ERK-2 activity by MAPK pathway inhibitors impaired both Vpx nuclear import and viral infectivity without affecting virus particle maturation and release. In addition, mutation analysis indicated that the inactivation of Vpx phosphorylation precluded nuclear import and reduced virus replication in macrophage cultures, even when functional integrase and Gag matrix proteins implicated in viral preintegration complex nuclear import are present. In this study, we also showed that co-localization of Vpx with Gag precursor in the cytoplasm is a prerequisite for Vpx incorporation into virus particles. Substitution of hydrophobic Leu-74 and Ile-75 with serines in the helical domain abrogated Vpx nuclear import, and its incorporation into virus particles, despite its localization in the cytoplasm, suggested that the structural integrity of helical domains is critical for Vpx functions. Taken together, these studies demonstrated that the host cell MAPK signal transduction pathway regulated an early step in SIV infection.

A critical step in the process of retrovirus infection is the transfer of viral DNA into the nucleus of the infected cells (1Cullen B.R.

In contrast, prototypic retroviruses do not replicate efficiently in non-dividing cells (5Lewis P.F. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 510-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms that underlie this restriction are not fully understood, inefficient nuclear transport of viral DNA appears to be one of them.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6155-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Vpx is an 18-kDa, 112-amino acid protein, which is highly conserved among all the divergent isolates of HIV-2 and SIVsm (7Henderson L.E. Sowder R.C. Copeland TD. Benveniste R.E. Oroszlan S.

Biol. 2003; 331: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Vpx is also essential for efficient in vivo dissemination and spread of SIVsm following mucosal and intravenous infection of macaques (4Hirsch V.M. Sharkey M.E. Byrum R. Elkins W.R. Hahn B.H. Lifson J.D. Stevenson M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Within viral particles, Vpx seems to be localized within the viral core (30Kewalramani V.N. Emerman M. Virology. 1996; 1: 159-168Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Vpx is packaged efficiently in the progeny virions formed in the absence of the pol and env gene products and is independent of viral RNA encapsidation (6Pancio H.A. Vander Heyden N. Ratner L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6162-6167Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Kappes J.C. Morrow C.D. Lee S.W. Jameson B.A. Kent S.B.H. Hood L.E. Shaw G.M. Hahn B.H. J.

These results indicate that expression of the HIV-2/SIV Gag precursor (Pr55Gag) is sufficient to mediate the incorporation of Vpx into virions. It is likely that the mechanism by which Vpx enters the assembling virion also dictates its association with the viral PICs. Recent studies (7Henderson L.E. Sowder R.C. Copeland TD. Benveniste R.E.

Virol. 2001; 75: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have shown that the packaging of Vpx into viral particles depends on the C-terminal p6 domain of the Gag polyprotein. As the Vpx protein is incorporated into the virion it becomes available during early replication events, immediately following entry of the new virion into a target cell even before de novo viral protein synthesis could start. Based on such late expression during virus production and early availability during initial infection, it has been proposed that Vpx is involved in the early stages of viral life cycle, particularly in the efficient import of viral genome into the nuclear compartment of non-proliferating target cells. The domain(s) and/or the amino acid(s) required for various functions of Vpx and its relevance to the optimal virus replication in non-dividing target cells have not been reported so far. Also, the mechanism by which Vpx incorporates into the virus particles and mediates the nuclear import of HIV-2/SIVsm PICs remains unknown. Mutations within the nuclear targeting domain abrogate nuclear import function of Vpx and attenuate replication of HIV-2 and SIV in macrophages (6Pancio H.A. Vander Heyden N. Ratner L. J.

Phosphorylation plays a critical role in the nuclear localization signal (NLS)-mediated nuclear transport, cell cycle progression, and gene expression (34Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 36Peterson R.T.

Phosphorylation-regulated NLSs were found to control nuclear transport in eukaryotic cells from yeast and plants to higher mammals (35Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For example, the archetypal NLS-containing simian virus 40 large T-antigen is regulated by the CcN motif. This motif comprises the T-antigen NLS (N), the phosphorylation site (C) of casein kinase II, 13 amino acids N-terminal to the NLS modulating the rate of nuclear import, and a cyclin-dependent kinase site (c) adjacent to the NLS regulating the maximal level of nuclear accumulation. Phosphorylation has been shown to regulate the progression of cell cycle and gene expression by changing the nuclear localization of various proteins, as well as their association with transcriptional activation factors (36Peterson R.T.

By having demonstrated that Vpx is the critical determinant for HIV-2/SIV replication in non-dividing cells, the present study was designed to understand the contribution of the Vpx nuclear transport and phosphorylation in the HIV-2/SIV life cycle. In this study, we show for the first time that ERK-2/MAPK is packaged into the SIVsm(PBj1.9) virions and that it phosphorylates Vpx and regulates SIV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation was directly implicated in the Vpx nuclear import and subsequent virus infection but not on viral maturation, assembly, and Vpx packaging into virus particles. These results reveal a new level of regulation of HIV-2 and SIV infection. Construction of Vpx Expression Vectors—Mutational analyses were performed by using the infectious molecular clone SIVsm(PBj1.9) (44Dewhurst S. Embretson J.E. Anderson D.C. Mullins J.I. Fultz P.N. Nature. 1990; 345: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into the PBj1.9 vpx gene (subcloned as an internal SpeI-ClaI DNA fragment). Mutagenized vpx genes were PCR-amplified and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) and also were reinserted into the PBj1.9 proviral vector using a series of subcloning steps. None of the introduced nucleotide substitutions resulted in amino acid changes in overlapping the virion infectivity factor (Vif) open reading frame. All introduced mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Infection—293T, COS-7, Vero, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). CEMx174 and Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% FBS. Macaque PBMCs were obtained from heparin-treated whole blood using lymphocyte separation medium (Organon Teknika). Macrophages were purified from unstimulated macaque PBMCs as described elsewhere (32Mahalingam S. Van Tine B. Santiago M.L. Gao F. Shaw G.M. Hahn B.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 106 macaque PBMCs were placed in 12-well tissue culture plates in macrophage medium containing 10% autologous macaque serum and conditioned medium to supply growth factors. Non-adherent cells were removed after 30-60 min of incubation at 37 °C, followed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were allowed to differentiate in macrophage medium for 10-12 days prior to virus infection. To examine the effects of MAPK inhibitor on virus infectivity, T-cells were stimulated with PMA, and the infectious virus particles were produced in the presence or absence of the MAPK inhibitor hypericin and were used for infection in macaque macrophages. For the generation of virus stocks, 293T cells were transfected with wild type and vpx mutant SIVsm(PBj1.9) proviral DNAs (10 μg) using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen). Cell culture supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and analyzed for core antigen (p27Gag) content using an SIV core antigen assay (Coulter). CEMx174 cells were then infected with supernatants containing 10 ng of p27Gag and were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Terminally differentiated macaque macrophages were infected with virion preparations containing 10 ng of p27Gag in 12-well plates overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Infected cells were washed extensively to remove residual virus and incubated at 37 °C. Culture supernatants were collected after every 3 days and were frozen at -70 °C for p27Gag determination at the conclusion of the experiments. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—The infection-transfection protocol for the vaccinia virus expression system was as described elsewhere (29Rajendra Kumar P. Singhal P.K. Vinod S.S. Mahalingam S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, Vero cells were grown to 90% confluence on 60-mm-diameter plates, infected for 1 h at 37 °C with vTF7-3, a vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (45Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), at a multiplicity of infection of 10, and then transfected with wild type or relevant vpx mutant constructs. Ten to 12 h after transfection, the cells were labeled for 5 h with 1.5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM containing 1.0 mCi of 32Pi (Bhabha Atomic Research Center), 1% dialyzed FBS, or Met/Cys-free DMEM containing 150 μCi of [35S]methionine (Bhabha Atomic Research Center). The labeled cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer without SDS (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in phosphate-buffered saline, with 0.2 mm Na2VO4 added to 32Pi-labeled samples). Then 3 μl of anti-Vpx antiserum was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Twenty microliters of immobilized protein-A beads was added, and the mixture was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-12% PAGE after extensive washing in buffer containing high salt and bovine serum albumin. The gels were dried and exposed to a XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at -80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—COS-7 cells in 60-mm-diameter dishes were infected with vTF7-3 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 1 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected with 5 μg of various Vpx expression plasmids using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), solubilized in loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), and separated on a SDS-12% PAGE. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with the monoclonal Vpx antibody (1:1000). Protein-bound antibodies were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated specific secondary antibodies (at a 1:2000 dilution) and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence-plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For determining the ability of Vpx packaging into virus particles, virions from the culture supernatants (293T cells were transfected with Vpx wild type and mutant proviral clones) were concentrated by ultracentrifugation (125,000 × g, 2 h) through a 20% sucrose cushion, and viral pellets were separated on a SDS-12% PAGE. Following electrophoresis, Western blot was performed as described above using monoclonal anti-Vpx and anti-Gag antibodies. Isolation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractions—Vpx expression plasmids were transfected into Vero cells using Lipofectin as described above. Transfected cells were labeled with 32Pi for 5 h, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspending the cell pellets with hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1.5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 45 min. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated by performing centrifugation of cell lysates at 12,500 rpm for 1 min after adding 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and were followed by immunoprecipitation using monoclonal Vpx antibody as described above. Fluorescence Microscopy—Vero cells in Chamber culture slides (Nunc) were infected with vTF7-3 and transfected with Vpx expression plasmids using Lipofectin as described above. Ten to 12 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and probed with the monoclonal anti-Vpx antibody (1:250) for 90 min at 37 °C. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) was used as a secondary antibody to visualize the subcellular localization of Vpx proteins. Vpx and Gag co-localization in the Vpx and Gag expression vectors co-transfected cells were determined by probing the cells with monoclonal anti-Vpx antibody (1:250) and polyclonal FLAG antibody (1:500), which recognizes the FLAG-Gag fusion protein. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG were used as secondary antibodies to visualize the subcellular localization of Vpx and Gag proteins, respectively. The cells were mounted in mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain the nuclei. Samples were viewed with an upright Nikon E800 microscope and photographed with a DXM1200 camera using Image Pro-plus software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). Confocal laser microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 META microscope. Construction, Expression, and Purification of His-Vpx, GST-Gag p17MA, and GST-c-Jun Fusion Proteins—Vpx from SIVsm(PBj1.9) was amplified by PCR using the forward (NdeI) primer 5′-GGTCGTCATATGATGTCAGATCCCAGGGAGAG-3′ and the reverse (BamHI) primer 5′-GATTAGGGATCCTTATGCTAGTCCTGGAGGGGG-3′. The PCR fragments were then cloned into pET16b vector at the NdeI and BamHI sites. JNK phosphorylation domain of c-Jun (forward primer BamHI, 5′-ATCGGGGATCCGATGACTGCAAAGATGGAA-3′, and reverse primer XhoI, 5′-CTAGGGCTCGAGTCAGGGGCACAGGAACTGGGT-3′) and SIVsm(PBj1.9) Gagp17MA (forward primer EcoRI, 5′-GATCCGAATTCTATGGGCGCGAGAAAC-3′, and reverse primer XhoI, 5′-GATCAGCTCGAGTTAGTAATTTCCTCCTTTGCCACT-3′) were amplified and cloned into pET41b vector as GST fusion. All the plasmids were transformed into the BL-21 DE3 strain of Escherichia coli and induced w"

We have transferred a 60-Mb chromosome 10-derived neocentric marker chromosome, mardel(10), and its truncated 3.5-Mb derivative, NC-MiC1, into mouse embryonic stem cell and have demonstrated a relatively high structural and mitotic stability of the transchromosomes in a heterologous genetic background. We have also produced chimeric mice carrying mardel(10) or NC-MiC1. Both transchromosomes were detected as intact episomal entities in a variety of adult chimeric mouse tissues including hemopoietic stem cells. Genes residing on these transchromosomes were expressed in the different tissues tested. Meiotic transmission of both transchromosomes in the chimeric mice was evident from the detection of DNA from these chromosomes in sperm samples. In particular, germ line transmission of NC-MiC1 was demonstrated in the F1 embryos of the chimeric mice. Variable (low in mardel(10)- or NC-MiC1-containing embryonic stem cells and chimeric mouse tissues and relatively high in NC-MiC1-containing F1 embryos) levels of missegregation of these transchromosomes were detected, suggesting that they are not optimally predisposed to full mitotic regulation in the mouse background, particularly during early embryogenesis. These results provide promising data in support of the potential use of neocentromere-based human marker chromosomes and minichromosomes as a tool for the study of centromere, neocentromere, and chromosome biology and for gene therapy studies in a mouse model system.

They also highlight the need to further understand and overcome the factors that are responsible for the definable rates of instability of these transchromosomes in a mouse model. Centromeres are chromosomal loci that ensure the correct segregation of chromosomes and inheritance of genetic information. In humans, the centromeres consist of the 171-bp α-satellite DNA that is tandemly repeated up to several megabases in size. In contrast, human neocentromeres belong to a new class of centromeres that are devoid of α-satellite DNA formed epigenetically following cytogenetic rearrangements (reviewed in Ref. 1Amor D.J. Choo K.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 695-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These neocentromeres associate with all of the functionally essential centromere proteins and heterochromatin proteins to form active kinetochores conferring full mitotic stability (2Saffery R. Irvine D.V. Griffiths B. Kalitsis P. Wordeman L. Choo K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Craig J.M. Wong L.H. Lo A.W. Earle E. Choo K.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The first described case of a neocentromere was found at the q25 region of a chromosome 10-derived marker chromosome mardel(10) (4Voullaire L.E. Slater H.R. Petrovic V. Choo K.H. Am. J. Hum.

Such HECs serve as a useful model system for the study of centromere and chromosome properties and as gene expression vectors to complement genetic deficiencies in human cells. Early studies in the construction of HECs have involved either the transfection of α-satellite DNA into human cells (6Ebersole T.A. Ross A. Clark E. McGill N. Schindelhauer D. Cooke H. Grimes B. Hum.

Another strategy has involved the amplification of pericentric satellite DNA followed by the breakage of chromosomes to produce satellite DNA-based HECs (18Csonka E. Cserpan I. Fodor K. Hollo G. Katona R. Kereso J. Praznovszky T. Szakal B. Telenius A. deJong G. Udvardy A. Hadlaczky G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3207-3216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kereso J. Praznovszky T. Cserpan I.

The discovery of neocentromeres has provided an alternative approach to the construction of HECs. We have described previously the production of mitotically stable neocentromere-based minichromosomes (NC-MiCs) through the telomere-mediated truncation of the mardel(10) chromosome (20Saffery R. Wong L.H. Irvine D.V. Bateman M.A. Griffiths B. Cutts S.M. Cancilla M.R. Cendron A.C. Stafford A.J. Choo K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5705-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These NC-MiCs are amenable to full sequence characterization to provide a well defined tool. In addition, we have examined the expression status of coding genes within our 10q25 neocentromere on the mardel(10) chromosome and demonstrated transcriptional competency within the CENP-A and CENP-H domains and throughout the domain of enhanced scaffold/matrix attachment region, indicating that the process of neocentromere formation that results in the assembly of highly specialized centromeric chromatin has no measurable effect on gene expression (21Saffery R.

Mice containing HECs or human chromosomal fragments have been generated to provide animal models for HEC studies; however, little is known regarding the stability and expression status of these exogenous chromosomes in the different mouse tissues (22Co D.O.

Genome Res. 2001; 11: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, we have generated transgenic mice containing a neocentromere-based mardel(10) or NC-MiC and studied the in vivo stability and gene expression status of these chromosomes in a range of tissues and cell types. Cell Culture and Transfection—HT1080 cell line containing NC-MiC1 and CHOK1-derived ZB30 cells containing mardel(10) tagged with zeocin resistance gene were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS or KAO-modified Hams' medium, respectively, as described previously (20Saffery R. Wong L.H. Irvine D.V. Bateman M.A. Griffiths B. Cutts S.M. Cancilla M.R. Cendron A.C. Stafford A.J. Choo K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5705-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Zeocin (Invitrogen) was added into both cultures at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Mouse embryonic stem cell line ES129.1 was cultured in DMEM with 15% heat-inactivated FCS and 103 units/ml leukemic inhibiting factor (Chemicon International) and 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The mouse ES129.1 cell line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated by the transfection of a plasmid pEF-GCF-C1 containing the GFP and neomycin-resistant genes. 5 × 107 cells were electroporated (1.2 kV/25 microfarads, Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator) with 15 μg of linearized construct. Cells were plated 24–48 h posttransfection, and 200 μg/ml neomycin G418 (Invitrogen) was added into the culture for selection of positive clones. Microcell-mediated Chromosome Transfer (MMCT)—Microcell fusion was carried out to transfer mardel(10) and NC-MiC1 tagged with zeocin resistance gene from the CHOK1 and HT1080 respective backgrounds into neomycin-resistant mouse ES129.1 cells expressing GFP (ES129.1GFP). Log-phase donor ZB30 cells were arrested in colcemid (Invitrogen) for 48 h and resuspended in Percoll/serum-free DMEM (1:1) supplemented with 20 μg/ml cytochalasin B (Sigma). The cell suspension was then subjected to centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 90 min at 32 °C. Both bands of cell mixture were pelleted, washed with serum-free DMEM, and filtered through isopore membranes of 30, 8, and 5 μm (Millipore Corp.). Microcells were then fused with recipient neomycin-resistant ES-GFP cells by the addition of 50% polyethylene glycol (Roche Applied Science) for 2 min at room temperature. After incubation, cells were rinsed and cultured overnight in ES medium containing 20% FCS followed by the addition of selection (250 μg/ml neomycin and 100 μg/ml Zeocin) 24 h later. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)—Standard procedures were followed for FISH analysis. Microtubule-depolymerizing agent colcemid was added at 10 μm for 1 h before the harvesting of the cells. These cells were then subjected to hypotonic treatment in 0.075 m of KCl followed by fixation in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid prior to spreading onto slides. The slides were then dehydrated in an ethanol series, denatured in 70% formamide/2× SSC at 70 °C, and hybridized at 37 °C overnight with the relevant labeled probes. After three washes in 0.1× SSC at 60 °C, the probes were detected with fluorescence-conjugated reagents according to the manufacturer's instruction. Images were collected using a fluorescence microscope linked to a CCD camera system. For reverse painting of NC-MiC1, total genomic DNA from ESGFPNC-MiC1 was subjected to Alu-PCR amplification (30Liu P. Siciliano J. Seong D. Craig J. Zhao Y. de Jong P.J. Siciliano M.J. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1993; 65: 93-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) followed by standard FISH analysis. Blastocyst Injection and Generation of Chimeric Mice—ES129.1GFP cell lines containing mardel(10) (ESGFPmar(10)-1) and NC-MiC1 (ES-GFPNC-MiC1-2) were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts by standard procedures (31Bradley A. Ramirez-Solis R. Zheng H. Hasty P. Davis A. CIBA Found. Symp. 1992; 165: 256-276PubMed Google Scholar). The injected blastocysts were then transferred into recipient pseudopregnant mice. Chimeric mice were selected by coat color. Chimeric mice were also crossed with C57BL/6 mice to generate embryos and mice containing germ line transmitted mardel(10) or NC-MiC1. Tissue Collection and Genotyping of Chimeric Mice and Embryo— Tissues collected from chimeric mice were subjected to DNA isolation using QIAamp tissue purification kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturers' protocols. In addition, certain tissues including lung, kidney, skin, and tail were also cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS for further analysis. The sperm samples were harvested from the uteri of the female C57BL/6 mice that had been mated with the chimeric mice generated as described above (32Mann G.B. Fowler K.J. Grail D. Dunn A.R. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 99: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To purify the hemopoietic stem cells, bone marrow was collected from mice (pretreated with 150 mg/kg body mass fluorouracil for 4 days) followed by washing with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysis on ice for 10 min (lysis solution 0.83% NH4Cl and 0.084% NaHCO3). The cells were then stained with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse Ly-6A/E (Sca-1) monoclonal antibody prior to sorting by FACS. The Ly-6A/E (Sca-1)-positive hemopoietic stem cells isolated by FACS were then subjected to another round of sorting to enrich the ES129.1GFP-derived cells. Cells collected were also cultured in the presence of 50 ng/ml stem cell factor, 10 ng/ml interleukin 3, 6 ng/ml interleukin 6, and 100 ng/ml FLT3 (Chemicon International). Individual F1 embryos were dissected from either the oviducts at 2.5 and 3.5 days or the implantation site at 9.5 days post coitum and washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. They were then subjected to either DNA purification for PCR analysis or incubation in DMEM medium containing 10 μm colcemid for 3 h prior to fixation onto slides for FISH analysis. PCR analysis was carried out on samples using the standard techniques. Primer sets neostart 1 (5′-ATGATTGAACAAGATGGATTGCAC-3′) and neocodR1 (5′-TGAGATGACAGGAGATCCTGC-3′) were used to detect the presence of ES129.1GFP-derived cells within tissues. For the identification of mardel(10) or NC-MiC1 in tissues or embryos, two primer sets were used (69k10F3, 5′-TTTGCTCACTAGCTGTCTCCTCAT-3′, with 69k10R6, 5′-GATCATTACCCAGACTCTGACCATT-3′, and 69k10F4, 5′-AGTTATGGAACTCACAAGACAGGAC-3′, with 69k10R7, 5′-ACATGATGTGGTAGTTGAGTTCACA-3′). RNA Purification and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was carried out using Titan one-step PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocols or a two-step procedure using cDNA prepared using TAQman reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) followed by standard PCR. Sequence-tagged Site PCR Analysis—Initial characterization of NC-MiC1 was carried out using sequence-tagged site PCR analysis and standard PCR procedures using markers and primer pairs listed in Supplementary Table I. Characterization of NC-MiC1—We have previously produced a somatic hybrid cell line (designated ZB30) containing mardel(10) tagged with a zeocin resistance gene in a Chinese hamster ovary background (20Saffery R. Wong L.H. Irvine D.V. Bateman M.A. Griffiths B. Cutts S.M. Cancilla M.R. Cendron A.C. Stafford A.J. Choo K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5705-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The transfer of the mardel(10) chromosome via MMCT into human HT1080 cells followed by telomere-associated chromosome truncation resulted in a number of lines containing truncated minichromosome derivatives of mardel(10) (20Saffery R. Wong L.H. Irvine D.V. Bateman M.A. Griffiths B. Cutts S.M. Cancilla M.R. Cendron A.C. Stafford A.J. Choo K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5705-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A cell line, NC-MiC1 (zeoR), was identified by FISH as carrying a small minichromosome containing the 10q25-derived neocentromere region and the zeocin resistance gene from a separate region of the mardel(10) chromosome formed through unknown rearrangements during the MMCT procedure (Fig. 1a). Reverse painting demonstrated that this minichromosome was derived solely from DNA of the 10q25 and 10p15 regions of chromosome 10 (Fig. 1c). As we had previously characterized the 10q25 region contained in this minichromosome (20Saffery R. Wong L.H. Irvine D.V. Bateman M.A. Griffiths B. Cutts S.M. Cancilla M.R. Cendron A.C. Stafford A.J. Choo K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5705-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), sequence-tagged site PCR analysis was performed to determine the content of the 10p15-derived DNA of this minichromosome. A total of 47 primer pairs spanning 15 Mb of the 10p region (Supplementary Table I) were used in amplification experiments on ESGFPNC-MiC1 genomic DNA that contained NC-MiC1 alone in a mouse ES background (see below). Of these primer sets, five produced positive signals in the PCR amplification. BAC clones in this region were then used in FISH experiments to directly visualize the 10p15 DNA content of NC-MiC1 (Fig. 1, b–c). From these combined analyses, the structure of NC-MiC1 was determined and the total size was calculated as ∼3.5 Mb. Mardel(10) and NC-MiC1 Remain Structurally Intact and Stable following Transfer into Mouse ES Cells—In this study, both ZB30 and HT1080-NC-MiC1 lines were used as donors for MMCT into mouse embryonic stem cell line ES129.1GFP expressing GFP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thirteen positive fusion cell lines containing mardel(10) and seven containing NC-MiC1 were isolated. One cell line containing mardel(10) (ESGF-Pmar(10)-1) and another containing NC-MiC1 (ESGFPNC-MiC1-2) were analyzed further. Mitotic stability of ESGFPmar(10)-1 over 80 cell divisions was 90% with selection and 80% without selection, suggesting that mardel(10) was largely stable but carried a very low rate (Table I). All of the other cell lines containing mardel(10) showed similar mitotic stability (with average loss rates of 0.15 and 0.25%/division with and without selection). NC-MiC1 was found to be slightly less stable in mouse ES 129.1 cells with retention rates of 70 and 55% with and without selection after 80 cell divisions, respectively. Likewise, all of the other NC-MIC1 containing cell lines were relatively similar in terms of their mitotic stability with the exception of two clones that demonstrated some degree of DNA amplification (with retention rates ranging from 50 to 75% after 80 divisions). Immunofluorescence using CREST6 autoimmune anticentromere serum (5du Sart D. Cancilla M.R. Earle E. Mao J.I. Saffery R. Tainton K.M. Kalitsis P. Martyn J. Barry A.E. Choo K.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and specific antiserum to centromere proteins CENP-A and CENP-E was positive on both mardel(10) and NC-MIC1 (Figs. 2 and 3). Detailed FISH analysis using human COT1, total genomic mouse DNA, mouse centromeric major and minor satellite DNAs, and various BAC probes at and surrounding the 10q25 neocentromere demonstrated that both the mardel(10) and NC-MiC1 remained structurally intact following MMCT transfer and had not acquired any mouse genomic sequences including centromeric elements (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, notwithstanding the low measurable loss rate, the results demonstrate the overall function of human neocentromeres to support mitotic stability of intact mardel(10) and NC-MiC1 minichromosome in the mouse ES cell background.Table IStability of ESGFPmar(10)-1 and ESGFPNC-MiC1-2 ESGFPmar(10)-1 and ESGFPNC-MiC1-2 were cultured for 80 divisions in the presence (100 μg/ml) or absence of zeocin. The cells were harvested at various intervals to determine the stability of mardel(10) or NC-MiC1. Retention rates of 80–90% and 55–70% were observed for the respective marker chromosomes after 80 cell divisions with and without selection, implying a small loss rate over time in the mouse ES cell background.Cell linePassage no.Division no.Drug selectionNo. of cells scoredPercentage of retentionLoss per division%ESGFPmar(10)-1520Zeocin2020/20 (100)01040Zeocin2019/20 (95)0.131560Zeocin2018/20 (90)0.172080Zeocin2018/20 (90)0.13ESGFPmar(10)-15202020/20 (100)010402018/20 (90)0.2515602017/20 (85)0.2520802016/20 (80)0.25ESGFPNC-MiC1-2520Zeocin2020/20 (100)01040Zeocin2017/20 (85)0.381560Zeocin2015/20 (75)0.422080Zeocin2014/20 (70)0.38ESGFPNC-MiC1-25202020/20 (100)010402015/20 (75)0.6315602013/20 (65)0.5820802011/20 (55)0.56 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Microcell-mediated chromosome transfer of NC-MiC-1 into mouse ES129.1GFP cells.

An analysis of tissue samples from adult mice by PCR using human chromosome 10q25-specific primers demonstrated the presence of both mardel(10) and NC-MiC1 in a variety of tissues (examples from two mice for each of mardel(10) and NC-MiC1 are shown in Tables II and III). In total, 85.7 and 84.6% chimeric mice were found to be positive for mardel(10) and NC-MiC1, respectively. Of the positive chimeric mice, we asked the question of what percentage of ES129.1GFP-derived tissues had retained the transchromosomes. The presence of parental ES129.1GFP cells was identified by PCR using primers corresponding to a part of the neomycin resistance gene that was present in these cells. The PCR results (some examples shown in Tables II and III) indicated that 74.6 and 69.5% ES129.1GFP-containing tissues were positive for mardel(10) and NC-MiC1, respectively. Together, the above analyses indicated ∼15% loss rate for the transchromosomes during chimeric mouse production and 25–30% loss rate within the ES cell-positive tissues of the transchromosomal mice.Table IIScreening of various tissues for the presence of mardel(10) in chimeric mouse PL (A) and CH (B) by PCR using specific primers to mardel(10) ES129.1 denotes PCR detection of neomycin resistance gene that was present in ES129.1 GFP-derived tissues. +ve and -ve denote the presence and absence of mardel(10) or the neomycin resistance gene in a particular tissue, respectively.(A) Chimeric mouse PLTissuesMardel(10)ES129.1Left lung+ve+veRight lung-ve+veLeft kidney+ve+veRight kidney-ve-veThymus-ve+veCecum+ve+veSmall intestine-ve-veLarge intestine-ve+veHeart+ve+veBrain+ve+veStomach-ve-vePale back skin+ve+veSternum+ve+veAdrenal-ve-veUterus-ve-veOvary-ve-veTongue-ve-veEsophagus-ve-veSalivary gland-ve-veLiver+ve+veBone marrow+ve+veSpleen+ve+vePancreas-ve+veTail-ve-veLeft leg-ve-veRight leg-ve+ve(B) Chimeric mouse CHTissuesMardel(10)ES129.1Left lung+ve+veRight lung-ve+veLeft kidney+ve+veRight kidney+ve+veThymus-ve-veCecum+ve+veSmall intestine-ve+veLarge intestine-ve-veHeart+ve+veBrain-ve-veStomach-ve-vePale back skin+ve+veSternum-ve-veAdrenal+ve+veUterus+ve+veOvary-ve+veTongue-ve+veEsophagus-ve-veSalivary gland-ve+veLiver+ve+veBone marrow+ve+veSpleen+ve+vePancreas+ve+veTail+ve+veLeft leg-ve-veRight leg-ve-ve Open table in a new tab Table IIIScreening of various tissues for presence of NC-MiC1 in chimeric mouse THO and JN by PCR using specific primers to NC-MiC1 ES129.1 denotes PCR detection of neomycin resistance gene that was present in ES129.1GFP-derived tissues. +ve and -ve denote the presence and absence of mardel(10) or the neomycin resistance gene in a particular tissue, respectively.(A) Chimeric mouse THOTissuesNC-MiC1ES129.1Left lung+ve+veRight lung+ve+veLeft kidney-ve-veRight kidney+ve+veSmall intestine-ve-veLarge intestine-ve-veHeart+ve+veBrain+ve+veStomach+ve+veThymus+ve+veAdrenal-ve+veTissuesNC-MiC1ES129.1Testis+ve+veEsophagus-ve-veLiver+ve+veBone marrow+ve+veSpleen+ve+veTail+ve+veSkeletal muscle+ve+veSkin+ve+veLeft eye+ve+veRight eye-ve-ve(B) Chimeric mouse JNTissuesNC-MiC1ES129.1Left lung+ve+veRight lung+ve+veLeft kidney-ve+veRight kidney+ve+veSmall intestine-ve+veLarge intestine+ve+veHeart-ve-veBrain-ve+veStomach+ve+veThymus-ve+veAdrenal+ve+veUterus-ve-veOvary-ve+veEsophagus-ve+veLiver+ve+veBone marrow+ve+veSpleen-ve+vePancreas+ve+veTail-ve-veLeft eye+ve+veSkeletal muscle+ve+ve Open table in a new tab Tissues such as skin, kidney, lung, and tail (other tissues were not viable in cultures) were collected from the transchromosomal chimeras for FISH analysis to determine the structural status of the introduced chromosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2093933478,"The role of chromatin-dependent regulatory mechanisms in the repression of glucocorticoid-dependent transcription from the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter by p65 and E1A was investigated by using chromatin and transiently transfected reporters. The p65 RelA subunit of NF-κB represses MMTV expression on either transient or integrated reporters. In contrast, the viral oncoprotein E1A represses a transient but not an integrated MMTV. E1A repression is attenuated by chromatin, suggesting p65 but not E1A manipulates chromatin appropriately to inhibit the GR. Coexpression of p65 and E1A additively represses the transient MMTV but restores the transcriptional activation of the chromatin MMTV in response to glucocorticoids. This indicates that E1A has a dominant chromatin-dependent activity that attenuates repression by p65. E1A, p65, and GR bind the MMTV promoter, and chromatin remodeling enhances binding on both repressed and activated promoters. In addition, p65 requires Brg for repression of the integrated MMTV. This suggests that neither p65 repression nor E1A attenuation of repression results from an inhibition of remodeling that prevents transcription factor binding. Furthermore, p300/CBP is also required for both repression and attenuation by p65 and E1A. E1A and p65 mutants that do not bind p300/CBP are inactive, indicative of a requirement for p300/CBP-dependent complex formation for both repression and attenuation with chromatin. These data suggest that both the p65-dependent repression and the E1A-mediated attenuation of repression require the Brg1-dependent chromatin remodeling function and p300/CBP-dependent complex formation at a promoter assembled within chromatin.

Repression of transcription has been shown to involve the regulation of chromatin and a requirement for chromatin-modifying genes in different functional capacities (1Gaston K. Jayaraman P.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 721-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The chromatin structure of heterochromatin is a long term, non-gene-specific, silencing mechanism. The establishment of the heterochromatin structure is a process that requires sequential participation of different chromatin-modifying proteins, and the heterochromatic structure blocks normal chromatin remodeling as the mechanism of action (2Moazed D. Rudner A.D. Huang J. Hoppe G.J. Tanny J.C. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 259 (163 –169): 48-62PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grigoryev S.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). More simply, repression may be achieved by disrupting the function of a particular cofactor required for activation. The target cofactor may be required for chromatin regulation or for non-chromatin-related activation functions (4Eckey M. Moehren U. Baniahmad A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 213: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Inactivation of a chromatin remodeling cofactor can repress without involving other regulatory factors as found for the Brg1 mutants (5Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3347-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternatively, direct repressors targeted to specific genes may require active chromatin remodeling function and specific modification of histones or DNA. For example, the retinoblastoma protein requires a functional BRG1 and recruits HDACs, 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; MMTV, murine mammary tumor virus; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid receptor element; WT, wild type; CMV, cytomegalovirus. histone methylase, HP1, and Dmnt1 for repression (6Murphy D.J.

The way these cofactors interact to establish a repressed gene in euchromatin is poorly understood. Most euchromatic genes are transiently responsive to both protein activators and repressors, and a repressive chromatin structure analogous to heterochromatin has not been shown for transient repressors. The effect of chromatin organization on transcriptional activation has been extensively studied for the MMTV promoter (12Hsiao P.W. Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The MMTV promoter is both functionally and structurally different when it is stably integrated compared with transiently transfected DNA, and the difference has been linked with specific chromatin structure and regulatory mechanisms. The MMTV promoter is organized as a phased array of nucleosomes when stably introduced into cells (13Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In contrast, transiently transfected MMTV reporters, although associated with histones, do not exhibit a normal nucleosome structure (15Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 16Cereghini S. Saragosti S. Yaniv M. Hamer D.H. Eur. J.

Specific transcription factors (NF1) bind less efficiently to a stable chromatin template, in the absence of hormone, compared with a transient template and exhibit a glucocorticoid-dependent increase in binding to the chromatin template that is not apparent on the transient template (18Archer T.K. Lee H.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Following hormone treatment, the integrated MMTV promoter is modified such that sites previously resistant to DNase I and restriction digestion become hypersensitive (15Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 19Zaret K.S. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). BRG1 is required for remodeling and activation, and competition for BRG1 can regulate expression (5Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3347-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Archer T.K. Lee H.L. Cordingley M.G. Mymryk J.S. Fragoso G. Berard D.S. Hager G.L. Mol.

Several protein transcription factors repress glucocorticoid-dependent transcription of MMTV, including the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB, adenovirus E1A, p53, Stat5, and AP1 (23McKay L.I.

All of these factors activate transcription from other genes in the same cells, so repression is a gene-specific function. The specific mechanism of repression has not been identified for any of these repressors, but targeting of cofactors with chromatin modifying activities has been reported. Repression of the MMTV by p65 involves a cooperative association of p65 with p300/CBP to form a repressor complex (23McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 24McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Repression of p65-activated promoters by GR may result from the loss of histone acetylase function in complexes (29Ito K. Jazrawi E. Cosio B. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30208-30215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 30Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Repression has also been suggested to result from the binding of GR or p65 to cofactors rendering them unavailable for activation (31Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D. Glass C.K.

Repression is correlated with recruitment of histone deacetylase, and the recruitment of histone deacetylases may specifically affect activity on chromatin templates (29Ito K. Jazrawi E. Cosio B.

Mymryk J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). There are two major E1A proteins, 13S and 12S, that respectively activate or repress transcription of specific genes. E1A does not encode a specific DNA binding domain but regulates cell growth and transcription via interaction with critical cellular proteins, including coactivators, corepressors, cell cycle control, and chromatin regulatory genes. E1A binds to both major categories of chromatin regulatory proteins, including histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling proteins. E1A binds p300/CBP and may disrupt p300/CBP activation function and histone acetylation or block p300 association with other histone acetylases such as p/CAF (34Frisch S.M. Mymryk J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

E1A targets the yGCN5p component of the SAGA complex, and expression of pCAF can overcome the growth arrest (40Shuen M. Avvakumov N. Walfish P.G. Brandl C.J. Mymryk J.S. J. Biol.

E1A binds the yeast SWI/SNF protein SNF12 and inhibits SWI/SNF-dependent gene activation (41Miller M.E. Cairns B.R. Levinson R.S. Yamamoto K.R. Engel D.A. Smith M.M. Mol. Cell.

E1A can regulate the MMTV promoter in various ways. In mouse cells, activation of the MMTV promoter by the E1A 13S isoform occurs on both stable and transient templates, but repression by the 12S isoform is template-dependent (25Soeth E. Thurber D.B.

E1A can modify the effects of other transcription factors such as the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, and the Vpr protein on the MMTV promoter (43Kino T. Gragerov A. Slobodskaya O.

Similarly, p65-mediated effects on MMTV and endogenous promoters can be modified by E1A (44Wissink S. van Heerde E.C. Schmitz M.L. Kalkhoven E. van der Burg B. Baeuerle P.A. van der Saag P.T. J.

Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 931-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This investigation explored how protein repressors use chromatin organization to influence repression. We evaluated chromatin remodeling during repression and whether chromatin regulatory cofactors are required for or lost in repression by p65 and E1A. We show that repression by p65 and E1A is mediated by chromatin context as is the attenuation of p65 repressor activity by E1A. Repression by p65 on chromatin requires a functional BRG1 and chromatin remodeling. E1A and p65 repression and chromatin-dependent attenuation of p65 repression requires a p300/CBP-dependent complex formation. Neither p65 repression nor E1A attenuation of repression results in the disruption of chromatin remodeling or loss of transcription factor binding at the promoter. This suggests that p65 repression and E1A regulation of repression depend on chromatin regulatory functions in common with activation and repress within the context of an actively remodeled promoter. Cells, Cell Culture, and Treatment—UL3 and SW13 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (H21, Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (46Fryer C.J.

SW13 cells were cotransfected with an MMTV-luciferase reporter and a neomycin-resistant cassette using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Stable clones were picked and tested for stable MMTV integration by transient transfection assay using GR and Brg1 expression plasmids. Transfection—Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with an efficiency of >80% as determined by β-galactosidase staining of cells transfected with 1 μgof pSport reporter (Clontech) (48MacGregor G.R.

The E1A 12S and RG2 are cDNAs for the specific isoforms (E. Moran, Temple University, Philadelphia). Transcription Assay—Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were induced with 100 nm dexamethasone for 16 h. Cells were assayed for both CAT and luciferase activity from a common lysate using CAT or luciferase assay kits (Promega). In Vivo Restriction Enzyme Hypersensitivity Analysis—The sensitivity of promoters to restriction enzymes was analyzed following transfection using a standard calcium phosphate procedure with 20 μg of expression vector DNA (pCMV, p65, or E1A). Cells were untreated or treated with dexamethasone for 1 h. Nuclei were isolated and digested with SstI (100 units/ml) for 15 min at 30 °C. DNA was purified and digested to completion with HaeIII. For assaying hypersensitivity on a transient template, phhCAT plasmid was transfected with the expression vectors and left treated or untreated with dexamethasone for 1 h. Nuclei were isolated and subjected to limited digestion with SstI (100 units/ml). DNA was purified and then digested to completion with AflII. Both the templates were analyzed by reiterative primer extension with oligonucleotide primer (5′-TCT GGA AAG TGA AGG ATA AGT GAC GA-3′: base pairs +60 to +84), and products were separated on 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gel (18Archer T.K. Lee H.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—UL3 cells were transfected with p65 or E1A and phhCAT plasmid for ChIP of the transient MMTV promoter. E1A or p65 were transfected alone for ChIP assays from the integrated MMTV promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using a ChIP kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, cells were untreated or treated for 1 h with dexamethasone (10–7m) and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min. Complexes were immunoprecipitated from p65-expressing cells with 10 μg of antibodies to p65, GR, or rabbit IgG for the nonspecific (NS) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). E1A-expressing cells were immunoprecipitated with E1A (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), GR and IgG were used as positive and negative controls. Complexes were collected using protein A-agarose/DNA beads and washed five times using low salt, high salt, LiCl, and TE buffers. Samples were divided in half for further analysis of coprecipitation with other proteins or MMTV DNA. After reversing cross-links at 65 °C for 4 h, the genomic DNA was purified from eluted complexes with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). MMTV DNA was detected by PCR amplification using primers flanking the GRE (sense 5′-TTAAGTAAGTTTTTGGTTACAAACT-3′ and antisense 5′-TCTGGAAAGTGAAGGATAAGTGACGA-3′) and including ∼300 bp of the proximal promoter. An antisense primer specific to the phhCAT plasmid (5′-TTAGCTTCCTTAGCTCCTGAAAAT-3′) was used to detect the transient template. Primers for the GAPDH promoter (sense 5′-AAAAGCGGGGAGAAAGTAGG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTAGCCTCCCGGGTTTCTCT-3′) as the non-linked control and the 3′-luciferase gene (sense 5′-CGTTGTTGTTTTGGAGCAC-3′ and antisense 5′-CTACATTTGGACTTTCCGC-3′) as the linked control were used to verify site-specific binding. Total PCR products were quantified from ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels using Alpha Innotech AlphaImager software. Samples were separately quantified from radiolabeled products separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels using PhosphorImager software (Amersham Biosciences). No qualitative difference was observed between the two techniques. Error bars shown on Fig. 4 represent quantitation from separate ChIP experiments. Coimmunoprecipitation—Coimmunoprecipitation was performed by alternative protocols using non-cross-linked or cross-linked proteins. No qualitative differences were observed between the two techniques in detection of protein association; however, protein binding was detected from cross-linked samples using substantially less starting material. For native immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 7A), UL3 cells were transfected with p65, E1A, or both and treated for 1 h with dexamethasone. Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in “native” buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor (Sigma). Whole cell lysates were preincubated with protein G-agarose beads. Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of the indicated antibody. Antibody complexes were collected by incubation with protein G-agarose beads followed by four washes with native buffer. For cross-linked immunoprecipitation (see Figs. 3 and 7B), cells were treated as described for the ChIP assay. Following immunoprecipitation and washing, the protein samples were resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer. Both native and cross-linked samples were boiled in SDS loading buffer, separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). Proteins were visualized using p65, E1A, or GR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody and chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Fig. 3Restriction enzyme hypersensitivity shows remodeling of the MMTV promoter.A, representative Western blot of p65 and E1A expression in UL3 cells transfected with pCMV, p65, E1A, or both.

To explore the underlying mechanisms and to evaluate the potential role of endogenous chromatin structure in this repression, we have compared p65 and E1A on the MMTV promoter when integrated within chromatin to the promoter introduced into the cells by transient transfection. Previous experiments established that the integrated MMTV promoter exhibits an organized chromatin structure of phased nucleosomes that limit the binding of transcription factors and prevent digestion by restriction enzymes in the absence of hormone-induced chromatin remodeling (51Kinyamu H.K. Archer T.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 30-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transiently transfected MMTV reporter exhibits an ill defined structure, binds transcription factors in the absence of hormone, and does not exhibit remodeling influenced hypersensitivity to restriction digestion (46Fryer C.J. Kinyamu H.K. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Archer T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17771-17777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We observed that both p65 and E1A effectively repress transient MMTV-CAT expression following treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Fig. 1A). CAT activity in p65-expressing cells is repressed 70% in comparison to control cells transfected with an empty CMV expression vector. Similarly, CAT activity in E1A-expressing cells is repressed 85%. Basal transcription from the transient MMTV is 11% of the hormone-induced levels and both p65 and E1A-expression reduce basal transcription by 50%. In contrast to the results with the transient promoter, p65 but not E1A repressed transcription of the integrated/chromatin MMTV promoter (Fig. 1B). In this case the integrated promoter was repressed by p65 to a degree similar to the transient promoter (65 versus 70%). However, not only did the E1A fail to repress the chromatin promoter, it exhibited an increase in luciferase expression compared with controls. The repression of the transient MMTV by both p65 and E1A suggests that repression does not require normal chromatin as a component in the mechanism of repression. However, the attenuation of E1A repression on the integrated MMTV suggests chromatin may restrict the function of a subgroup of repressor proteins and/or that E1A, in contrast to p65, is unable to effectively remodel/modify the chromatin template to repress transcription. E1A Regulates p65 Repression on the Chromatin MMTV Promoter—E1A can bind directly to p65 (52Schmitz M.L. Indorf A. Limbourg F.P. Stadtler H. Traenckner E.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4052-4063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, p65 and E1A both bind to p300/CBP, although p65 binds via the p300 CH1 domain, and E1A binds to the CH3 domain (53Ugai H. Uchida K. Kawasaki H. Yokoyama K.K. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 54Chen J.D. Li H. Crit. Rev.

Thus E1A and p65 potentially influence the activity of one another and do so in some systems (52Schmitz M.L. Indorf A. Limbourg F.P. Stadtler H. Traenckner E.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2065763743,"In Escherichia coli, the UhpT transporter catalyzes the electroneutral accumulation of sugar 6-phosphate by exchange with internal inorganic phosphate (Pi). The substrate specificity of UhpT is regulated at least in part by constituents of an Asp388-Lys391 intrahelical salt bridge, and mutations that remove one but not both of these residues alter UhpT preference for organophosphate substrates. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we examined the role played by these two positions in the selection of the oxyanion countersubstrate. We show that derivatives having aliphatic or polar residues at positions 388 and 391 are gain-of-function mutants capable of transporting SO4 as well as Pi. These oxyanions share similar structures but differ significantly in the presence of a proton(s) on Pi. Our findings therefore lead us to suggest that the Asp388-Lys391 ion pair acts normally as a filter that prevents substrates lacking a proton that can be donated from occupying the UhpT active site.

Despite this heterogeneity, members of the MFS appear to share a common architectural theme characterized by the presence of ∼12 transmembrane segments that transverse the membrane in an α-helical conformation. The recent publication of high resolution structures for several of the best studied (yet unrelated) members of this superfamily (5Hirai T. Heymann J.A.W. Shi D. Sarker R. Maloney P.C. Subramaniam S.

We have applied these techniques to the study of UhpT, the Pi-linked hexose phosphate antiport carrier of Escherichia coli (8Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Sonna L.A. Varadhachary A.

Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6625-6630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to identify determinants of substrate selectivity. In previous work, TM11 of UhpT was shown to contain an intrahelical salt bridge with the constituents Asp388 and Lys391 that lie on the substrate translocation pathway (11Hall J.A. Fann M-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Further analysis indicated that these two positions play a direct role in determining substrate specificity (11Hall J.A. Fann M-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Hall J.A. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25107-25113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, derivatives having an uncompensated cationic charge at either position 388 or 391 are gain-of-function mutants in which substrate preference is strongly biased in favor of phosphoenolpyruvate, a substrate that carries one more negative charge than sugar 6-phosphate. If, however, an uncompensated anionic charge is placed at position 388, one observes behavior consistent with an increased preference for monovalent rather than divalent sugar 6-phosphate, as though the resident anion were acting as an anionic charge entering on sugar phosphate. Here, we provide evidence that when non-ionic residues occupy these two positions, UhpT can accept both Pi and SO4, suggesting that this region also plays a role in discriminating between these two oxyanions. Strains and Plasmids—Strain XL1-Blue (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac (F′ proAB lacIqZΔM15 Tn10)) (Stratagene Cloning Systems) was used for all cloning steps.

Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the sequential polymerase chain reaction (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Morton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). Mutant uhpT alleles were sequenced at the Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility of the Johns Hopkins Medical School to confirm the desired mutation and to rule out the presence of other changes. Whole Cell Transport Assays—Unless noted otherwise, overnight cultures were diluted 200-fold into M63 minimal medium, pH 7 (15Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar), containing thiamine (2 μg/ml), required amino acids (50 μg/ml), antibiotics (100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml ampicillin), and 0.2% (w/v) glucose as a carbon source. The high Pi content of M63 ensured maximal repression of other Pi transporters (Pst and Pit) so that most Pi transport occurred via UhpT (11Hall J.A. Fann M-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Cells were grown at 37 °C to a density of 2–5 × 108 cells/ml, harvested by centrifugation, and then washed twice and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm MOPS/K, pH 7) at an optical density at 660 nm of 1.4, equivalent to about 2 × 109 cells/ml. After equilibration at room temperature, tests of Glc-6-P, SO4, or Pi transport were initiated by adding a 0.1 or 0.05 volume of labeled substrate to a final concentration of 50 μm, 1mm, or 100 μm, respectively. At indicated times, aliquots were removed for filtration on Millipore filters (0.45-μm pore size) followed by two washes with 5 ml of buffer A. Protein Purification, Reconstitution, and Transport Assays—His10-tagged, cysteineless UhpT and its D388V/K391C derivative were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity chromatography. Overnight cultures were diluted 50-fold into 400 ml of M63 medium (as above) and grown at 37 °C to OD660 1.0–1.2. To induce UhpT expression, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mm, and cells were harvested after 2 h. Cells were then washed twice with 20 ml of 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 20 ml of 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 200 μg of DNase I. Cells were disrupted in the cold using a French pressure cell (16,000 p.s.i.), and after removal of unbroken cells and cell debris by low speed centrifugation (12,000 × g for 30 min), membranes were pelleted (150,000 × g for 1 h) and resuspended in 8 ml of buffer B (100 mm potassium Pi, 20% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% E. coli phospholipid, 1.5% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside, pH 7.5). After incubation for 1 h on ice, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (150,000 × g, 1 h), and the supernatant was added to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose slurry preequilibrated in buffer B. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking, after which the resin was loaded onto a QUIK-SEP column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and washed with 6 times with 2 ml of buffer B adjusted to pH 7 and containing 0.25% E. coli phospholipid and 50 mm imidazole. Histidine-tagged UhpT was then eluted from the resin by adding 400 μl of buffer B, pH 7, containing 0.25% E. coli phospholipid and 250 mm imidazole instead of 200 mm NaCl. Purified material, estimated to be 70–80% UhpT by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was stored at -80 °C until use. To reconstitute purified UhpT into proteoliposomes, 2 μg of protein, assayed using the procedure of Brown et al. (17Brown R.E. Jarvis K.L. Hyland K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), was mixed for 20 min on ice in a total volume of 375 μl with a buffer, pH 7, containing 100 mm potassium Pi, 1mm dithiothreitol, 1.5% octyl-β-d-glucoside, and 3.75 mg of E. coli phospholipid. Proteoliposomes were formed by a 40-fold dilution into chilled buffer of 50 mm MOPS/potassium, 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7, and isolated by centrifugation (150,000 × g, 1 h) at 4 °C. The proteoliposome pellet was then washed twice and resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mm MOPS/K, 161 mm KCl, pH 7, again isolated by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in 375 μl of the same buffer, and stored on ice prior to assay. To assay UhpT-mediated transport, reconstituted proteoliposomes were diluted 10-fold into 50 mm MOPS/K, 161 mm KCl, pH 7, and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature before the addition of radiolabeled substrate. Transport activity was examined using the same general procedures employed to assay substrate transport in whole cells except that 0.22-μm filters were used. Chemicals—[14C]Glc-6-P (49.3 μCi/μmol), [32P]potassium Pi (1 Ci/mmol), and [35S]Na2SO4 (550–600 μCi/μmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. E. coli phospholipid was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and both n-dodecyl-β-maltoside and octyl-β-d-glucoside were from Calbiochem.

We showed previously that both Asp388 and Lys391, normally associated in a TM11 intrahelical salt bridge, can play a direct role in determining substrate specificity (11Hall J.A. Fann M-C.

For example, elimination of the anionic partner, which introduces an uncompensated positive charge in this region, alters UhpT substrate bias so as to favor organophosphate substrates with increased electronegative character. Such findings prompted us to ask whether this region might also play a role in discriminating between the low affinity Pi substrate and other oxyanions, such as SO4, that are normally excluded. In the present study we explored the role of TM11 in oxyanion selectivity, beginning with an analysis of the UhpT D388C/K391C variant, a mutant whose behavior is markedly affected by the presence of SO4. Thus, in the absence of salts and in the presence of KCl, this variant and its parent transported 32Pi with comparable efficiency; by contrast, 32Pi transport by the mutant was strongly inhibited when K2SO4 was added to the assay medium (Fig. 1). This finding suggests that SO4 is either a substrate for or an inhibitor of transport by the D388C/K391C variant, and because this mutant displays normal levels of Pi self-exchange in the absence of salts (Figs. 1 and 4, Table I), we could address this issue by measuring the relative effectiveness with which added SO4 caused loss of internal Pi during heterologous exchange (Fig. 2). As expected, the addition of both Glc-6-P and Pi led to a marked loss of internal phosphate from cells carrying either cysteineless or D388C/K391C UhpT, whereas SO4 induced significant Pi efflux only in the D388C/K391C mutant. These findings strongly argue that D388C/K391C is a gain-of-function mutation that allows UhpT to recognize and transport both Pi and SO4. This supposition was confirmed by the finding that this mutant, and not its parent, was able to transport SO4 (Fig. 3).Fig. 4Transport of Glc-6-P, Pi, and SO4.

Analysis of UhpT relatives suggests that although some residues within TM11 are highly conserved, the Asp388-Lys391 ion pair is restricted to family members that transport sugar 6-phosphate (11Hall J.A. Fann M-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Fann M-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By contrast, in examples that do not transport sugar 6-phosphate, either aliphatic (Ala or Val) or polar residues (Asn, Ser, or Thr) are found at these two positions. With this in mind, we generated UhpT double mutants in which Asp388 was replaced by Ala, Cys, or Val and Lys391 was replaced with either a Cys or Thr. All of these variants, unlike their parent, are able to transport Glc-6-P and Pi as well as SO4 (Fig. 4). A more detailed analysis indicated that removal of the Asp388-Lys391 salt bridge, although associated with modest changes in the affinities for Glc-6-P or Pi, led to a marked increase in the ability to accept SO4 from an unquantifiably low level to Km values in the range of 10–35 mm (Fig. 5, Table I). We believe these observations are consistent with the idea that the Asp388-Lys391 ion pair in UhpT normally aids in defending the active site against SO4. Characterization of UhpT SO4 Transport—Among the gain-of-function mutants described above, the D388V/K391C derivative exhibits the highest affinity for SO4 (Table I), making this variant the most convenient model with which to characterize this novel transport reaction. Our first tests analyzed the response to changes in external pH. We found that acidification diminished the activity of both the parental and mutant (D388V/K391C) proteins. For Pi transport, this reflects reduced turnover because, as pH fell from 7.5 to 5.2, Vmax values were reduced 10–50-fold with little change (1–2-fold) in the Km for Pi (not shown) (20Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Thomas J. Schiller L. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 238-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For SO4 transport, however, we observed significant changes in both kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax) over this same pH range (Fig. 6). In particular, as assay pH became more acidic, the Km for SO4 transport by the mutant decreased significantly, showing a nearly 10-fold drop from its value of 18 mm at pH 7.5 to near 2 mm at pH 6.1 and below (Fig. 6). Because SO4 exists as a divalent species and E. coli maintains a slightly alkaline cytoplasmic pH under physiological conditions (21Padan E. Zilberstein D. Rottenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), one would not expect this change in affinity to arise from a change in stoichiometry for the exchange of external SO4 and internal substrate (Pi or Glc-6-P). Instead, this decrease in affinity is better explained by changes in the protonation state of a residue on the translocation pathway. Because SO4 affinity in the D388V/K391C variant is greatest at a pH near 6.1, this role may be played by histidine (pK2 6.0). Analysis of the UhpT primary sequence suggests His168 (in TM5) as a possible candidate in this regard. His168 is conserved within the family of organophosphate transporters and receptors, and crystallography of GlpT, the glycerol 3-phosphate antiporter of E. coli, shows this residue positioned close to the two essential arginines known to interact with UhpT substrates (7Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D-N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). We next examined the homologous and heterologous exchange reactions in the D388V/K391C variant relative to its parent. As illustrated in Fig. 7, both proteins mediated Pi self-exchange and the heterologous exchange of internal Pi with external Glc-6-P; only in the gain-of-function derivative was Pi efflux induced by the addition of SO4 to the external medium (Fig. 7B). Further study indicated that the mutant also displays SO4 efflux when either Glc-6-P, Pi, or SO4 acts as the external countersubstrate. We noted, however, that Pi, despite having a relatively high affinity for this UhpT variant, provoked low rates of SO4 efflux relative to those found with SO4 and Glc-6-P. We attribute this to a futile Pi self-exchange that obscures the net heterologous reaction (Pi for SO4). This phenomenon is often found when two substrates with widely different affinities for exchange are used (8Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Sonna L.A. Varadhachary A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sonna L.A. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 101: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present case, this phenomenon would reflect that as (unlabeled) Pi accumulates, this relatively high affinity substrate competes successfully with (labeled) SO4 for efflux. On the other hand, because Glc-6-P is readily metabolized, exogenous Glc-6-P would not elicit this response when added to intact cells. To circumvent the complexities associated with evaluating UhpT-mediated SO4 exchange in whole cells, we purified and reconstituted both the D388V/K391C protein and its parent. Proteoliposomes were prepared to contain Pi as the sole internal substrate, and homologous as well as heterologous Pi-linked exchanges were documented (Fig. 8). As anticipated from work with intact cells, we found comparable behavior for both mutant and parental proteins in regard to Pi and Glc-6-P transport; SO4 transport, which could be blocked by both Pi and Glc-6-P, was noted only in preparations containing the mutant protein (Fig. 8C). These findings conform to the general behavior of the gain-of-function mutant as tested in intact cells and, when taken together with our other findings, lead us to conclude that the region in and around positions 388 and 391 serves as one determinant of UhpT oxyanion selectivity. Instances of altered substrate specificity within the MFS have been demonstrated for a number of transporters. For example, point mutations in LacY, the lactose permease of E. coli, can lead to a preference for maltose (23Brooker R.J. Wilson T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3959-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), malto-oligosaccharides (24Olsen S.G. Greene K.M. Brooker R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6269-6275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sucrose (25King S.C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9638-9644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or arabinose (26Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Membr. Biochem. 1993; 10: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarly, single amino acid changes in the CitA citrate transporter of Salmonella typhimurium and the MelY melibiose-H+ symporter of Enterobacter cloacae alter substrate specificity so as to allow isocitrate and maltose transport, respectively (27Shimamoto T. Negishi K. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 28Shinnick S.G. Perez S.A. Varela M.F. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3672-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In earlier work with UhpT, we reported comparable effects arising from mutations (at positions 388 and 391) in TM11 that can lead to a bias favoring phosphoenolpyruvate and 3-phosphoglyceric acid over the normal sugar 6-phosphate substrates (11Hall J.A. Fann M-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Hall J.A. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25107-25113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such precedents argue that small structural perturbations may result in physiologically significant differences in substrate preference. Here, we expand upon such work by identifying alterations of the TM11 intrahelical salt bridge (Asp388-Lys391) that allow UhpT to transport SO4. The notion that positions in TM11 might act as determinants of both UhpT organophosphate and oxyanion substrate specificity, and thus line the transport pathway, is in agreement with both bioinformatic information and the known structures of members of the MFS. Thus, the general helix-packing model proposed by Goswitz and Brooker (29Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggests that TM11 is within the core of potential pathway-lining segments of MFS transporters. Further, all three solved MFS transporter structures (GlpT (7Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D-N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) and lactose permease (LacY) (6Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar) of E. coli and the oxalate:formate exchange protein (OxlT) (5Hirai T. Heymann J.A.W. Shi D. Sarker R. Maloney P.C. Subramaniam S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 597-600PubMed Google Scholar) of Oxalobacter formigenes) confirm that residues on TM11 form part of the transport pathway. Interestingly, by using the GlpT structural template, a homology model of UhpT in which Asp388 and Lys391 orient toward the transport pathway can be derived. 2Q. Yang and P. C. Maloney, manuscript in preparation. Although this model (and the GlpT structure) depicts a conformation that faces the cytoplasmic membrane, it seems likely that during the global conformational changes that occur as UhpT (GlpT) fluctuates between cytoplasm and periplasm open states, these positions could be exposed to the substrate translocation path at some, if not all, times during the reaction cycle. This supposition is reinforced by our biochemical studies with both lysine- and thiol-specific probes that indicate that a large tract of TM11, including the surface containing positions 388 and 391, lies on the aqueous permeation pathway within UhpT (12Hall J.A. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25107-25113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Hall J.A. Maloney P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3756-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Our current findings not only substantiate earlier work that places positions 388 and 391 on the transport pathway but also provide insight into the mechanism by which UhpT discriminates between Pi and SO4. Despite the structural similarity of these oxyacids, UhpT has a marked preference for Pi relative to SO4 (Fig. 4, Table I), suggesting the presence of a molecular “filter” that discriminates between the two. The nature of such a filter may now be at least partially explained by analogy with the periplasmic Pi-binding protein of E. coli. In that case, crystallography shows that the stringent specificity of this receptor for Pi is because of a single carboxylate group that not only accepts a proton donated by Pi but also disallows SO4 binding via charge repulsion (31Quiocho F.A. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 943-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Luecke H. Quiocho F.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Because UhpT-mediated SO4 transport is only observed when non-ionic residues occupy both positions 388 and 391, one role of Asp388 may be to aid in defending the active site against SO4. We suggest that this is accomplished through charge stabilization. Although contributing to the inability of fully ionized SO4 to achieve an electrostatic balance at the substrate binding site, Asp388 assists in the recognition of Pi via acceptance of a hydrogen bond. The idea that such a function can be attributed to this residue is strengthened by the earlier finding (12Hall J.A. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25107-25113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that the protonation state of Asp388 in the K391C UhpT variant aids in determining whether mono- or divalent sugar phosphate is transported. We also note that the Asp388-Lys391 ion pairing is restricted to members of the organophosphate transporter family that accept sugar 6-phosphate, yet SO4 is rejected as a countersubstrate for all members of this family (8Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Sonna L.A. Varadhachary A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It seems likely, therefore, that the discrimination provided by TM11 in UhpT is supplemental to a more general oxyanion exclusion mechanism shared by all family members. Together with previous studies, the work presented here allows elements required for UhpT function and specificity to be added to the scaffolding provided by recent publication of MFS transporter structures. For example, Arg45 and Arg275, both essential and conserved throughout the UhpT family (19Fann M-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), lie at the center of the substrate translocation pathway and take part in recognizing the anionic phosphoryl group of the organosubstrate (7Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D-N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 12Hall J.A. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25107-25113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The constituents of the Asp388-Lys391 salt bridge, on the other hand, are positioned near the cytoplasmic edge of the pathway (12Hall J.A. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25107-25113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and, although not required for sugar phosphate transport function, appear to act as supplemental oxyanion and organophosphate charge filters. The location of these specificity determinants ensures that the inorganic substrate only binds to the active site when it is capable of both donating a proton (i.e. mono- or divalent phosphate groups) and establishing an electroneutral environment within the binding pocket. Only when these conditions are satisfied is UhpT capable of facilitating substrate exchange through interconversion between the cytoplasm and periplasm open conformations."
