https://openalex.org/W1559956276,"A sleep-promoting substance, Factor S, has been extracted and purified from large volumes of human urine. Urinary Factor S is a small glycopeptide; amino acid-amino sugar analyses of the purified material revealed a substance composed of glutamic acid, alanine, diaminopimelic acid, and muramic acid in molar ratios of 2:2:1:1. The active glycopeptide resembles bacterial peptidoglycans but the composition suggests that it is not simply of adventitious origin. Other reasons for this conclusion are also given. Infusions into the lateral ventricle of the brain of about 5 pmol/kg of body weight induce a 50% increase in slow wave sleep in rabbits. The excess sleep is normal as judged by electrophysiological and behavioral criteria; it resembles the deep sleep that occurs when animals are allowed to sleep following prolonged sleep deprivation."

This procedure allowed isolation of the chromogranins (a class of related acidic glycoproteins) and of two proteoglycans, as well as a fraction highly enriched in dopamine 8hydroxylase. Oligosaccharides and glycopeptides were fractionated and purified by ion-exchange, thin layer, and affinity chromatography, and their structural properties were studied by methylation analysis and specific degradations. The chromogranins contain 5.4% carbohydrate consisting predominantly of 0-glycosidically linked triand tetrasaccharides composed of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and sialic acid (N-acetyl-(AcNeu) and/ o r N-glycolylneuraminic (GcNeu) acid), as well as a small proportion of N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide units. One-half of the 0-glycosidically linked carbohydrate is released by alkaline borohydride in the form of the trisaccharides AcNeu(a2 + 3)Gal(81 -P 3)GalNAcol (N-acetyl-D-galactosaminitol) (40%) and GcNeu(a2 + 3)Gal(81-+ 3)GalNAcol(lO%). The tetrasaccharide components consist of AcNeu(a2 + 3)Gal(fl1 + 3)[AcNeu(a2 + 6)IGalNAcol (20%), GcNeu(a2 -P 8)GcNeu(a2 + 6)[Gal(fll+ 3)]GalNAcol(7%), as well as 16 and 78 , respectively, of the tetrasaccharide structures given above but in which the two types of sialic acid cannot be individually assigned to specific linkage positions. After fractionation of the chromogranins by gel filtration, it was found that these oligosaccharides are not uniformly distributed as a function of chromogranin size, insofar as the largest chromogranins (chromogranin A) contain predominantly trisaccharides, whereas the tetrasaccharides are concentrated in the chromogranins of intermediate molecular size. The chromaffin granule matrix also contains two proteoglycans (I and 11) in which the glycosaminoglycan component consists of 48% dermatan sulfate, 2324% each of chondroitin 4and 6-sulfate, and 5% heparan sulfate. Nand 0-glycosidically linked glycoprotein oligosaccharides are also present. Although the two proteoglycans appear to have very similar o r identical protein moieties, proteoglycan 11 has twice the concentration of glycosaminoglycans and one-halfthe concentration of 0-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides (primarily disialyl derivatives of Gal(B1 + 3)GalNAc) as compared to proteoglycan I. .* This work was supported by Grants NS-09348 and NS-13876 from the National Institutes of Health, Grant BNS-7915410 from the National Science Foundation, and a grant from the Sigrid Juse1iu.q Foundation, Finland.

https://openalex.org/W1545953723,"Uteroferrin, a purple-colored, iron-containing phosphatase which is induced by progesterone in the porcine uterus, has been proposed to be an intermediary in iron transfer between the mother and conceptus in the pig. Along with a number of other uterine proteins of maternal origin, it accumulates in the allantoic fluid during mid-pregnancy. When [59Fe]uteroferrin was introduced into the allantoic sacs of five fetuses at Day 60 of pregnancy, its iron was transferred to another protein, identified as transferrin. The half-life of iron loss from uteroferrin was approximately 24 h and the kinetics suggested an approximately second order process. 59Fe was also distributed to the fetus and was recovered at high specific activity in the fetal red blood cells (as hemoglobin), liver, and spleen. Introduction of [59Fe] transferrin to allantoic fluid resulted in an almost identical distribution of isotope in the fetus as was observed with [59Fe]uteroferrin. Whereas [125I]transferrin has been shown to be capable of leaving the allantoic sac in intact form, [125I]uteroferrin either has only a limited capacity to exit or else is almost immediately degraded upon entering the fetal circulation. Following loss of its iron to transferrin in allantoic fluid, uteroferrin rapidly loses immunological reactivity and is cleaved proteolytically into small peptides. The transfer of iron between uteroferrin and transferrin has also been followed in vitro. Iron on uteroferrin is relatively stable to pH and is not readily lost to transferrin at around neutral pH unless low molecular iron chelators such as citrate, pyrophosphate, ATP, or ascorbate are present. Iron transfer was promoted at ascorbate concentrations (approximately 50 microM) and at pH values (approximately 6.8) approximating those found in allantoic fluid. Results are consistent with a model in which maternal uteroferrin can transfer its iron to fetal transferrin via a low molecular weight intermediary in the allantoic sac. Transferrin is then responsible for iron distribution to the fetus."

https://openalex.org/W1603968791,"Rats on a normal diet were administered physiological doses of [3H]retinyl acetate or [3H]retinol orally for 5 days to label endogenous retinoid pools. The kidney retinoids were extracted and separated by DEAE-Sephadex into neutral and acidic fractions. All-trans-retinoic acid and 5,6-epoxyretinoic acid were isolated and unequivocally identified by chromatographic analysis, chemical derivatization, and mass spectroscopy. The identities of retinol and retinyl palmitate were verified by high performance liquid chromatography and reactivity with trifluoroacetic acid. Control experiments showed that retinoid epoxidation truly occurred in vivo. The specific radioactivities of the recovered acidic retinol metabolites were similar to those of the recovered neutral retinoids. Thus, retinoic acid and its metabolite 5,6-epoxyretinoic acid are endogenous rat kidney retinoids which are in the pathway of retinol metabolism under physiological conditions. The concentrations of retinyl palmitate (8.7 microM), retinol (4.6 microM), all trans-retinoic acid (1.3 microM) and 5,6-epoxyretinoic acid (0.25 microM) measured indicate that acidic retinoids are comparatively significant vitamin A metabolites in kidney."

https://openalex.org/W135258530,"The coupled transport of Na+ with succinate and citrate into rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles was studied. Initial rates of transport (J) were estimated from 1-s uptakes under well defined transmembrane conditions (membrane potential, pH, ionic composition). A Na+ gradient increased J up to 700 times compared to Na+ replacement with sorbitol. J was a sigmoid function of increasing Na+ concentration; the kinetic interaction of Na+ with the succinate-citrate transport system was described by the equation: J = Jmax/(1 + (Ks/[Na]))3. Assuming that the Na+ interaction involves equivalent, noninteracting binding sites, these results indicate that 3 Na+ ions are translocated/molecule of organic substrate. Consistent with the latter observation was the direct demonstration of a stoichiometric coupling between simultaneously determined fluxes of 22Na+ and 14C-labeled substrates. In excess of 2 Na+ ions were transported/molecule of organic substrate. These results explain the electrogenicity of the transport of succinate and citrate as evidenced by the response of J to K+ diffusion potentials and the effects of transport on the fluorescence of a potential-sensitive cyanine dye."
https://openalex.org/W20444207,"Phenylephrine (1.5 x 10(-6) M) administered to perfused livers from fed rats gave rise to a rapid, parallel increase in oxygen uptake and glucose output. The time of onset for oxygen uptake was 9.9 +/- 0.4 s following phenylephrine administration, and immediately preceded glucose output which occurred at 11.6 +/- 0.5 s. Near-maximal effects were observed 50 s following alpha-agonist treatment. Both responses appear to be mediated by alpha- 1-adrenergic receptors. The mitochondrial respiratory chain blockers antimycin A and rotenone, inhibited the alpha-agonist-induced oxygen uptake and glycogenolytic responses at inhibitor concentrations similar to those required to block uncoupler-stimulated respiration in the intact perfused liver. Oligomycin and carboxyatractyloside also inhibited the phenylephrine-induced respiratory response. Vasopressin (1 milliunit/ml), and angiotensin II (6 x 10(-9) M) had effects similar to phenylephrine in the perfused liver which also were prevented by the prior administration of antimycin A and rotenone. In contrast, glucagon-induced (10(-8) M) glycogenolysis proceeded in the absence of large changes in respiration, was slower in onset (26.1 +/- 4.2 s following hormone administration), and was not inhibited by mitochondrial respiratory blockers. These data indicate that glycogenolysis induced by alpha-adrenergic agonists, vasopressin, and angiotensin II is associated with a large increase in mitochondrial respiration, that may play a role in a general, as yet undefined mechanism whereby these agents stimulate glycogenolysis in rat liver."

https://openalex.org/W1581663892,"Abstract Activity of a Na+/H+ antiporter has been suggested to be critically involved in pH homeostasis in obligately alkalophilic bacteria (Krulwich, K. A., Mandel, K. G., Bornstein, R. F., and Guffanti, A. A. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 91, 58-62) and in Escherichia coli (Zilberstein, D., Padan, E., and Schuldiner, S. (1980) FEBS Lett. 116, 177-180). A concern with respect to these proposals has been the failure of either Bacillus alcalophilus or E. coli to exhibit a requirement for added Na+ for growth. Thus, it became of interest to examine Na+-coupled porter functions in obligately alkalophilic Bacillus firmus RAB, a species that exhibits an absolute requirement for added Na+ for growth at pH 10.5. In a comparative study using membrane vesicles from B. alcalophilus and B. firmus RAB it was found that both the Na+/H+ antiporter and the Na+/alpha-aminoisobutyric acid symporter from the Na+-requiring species had much lower apparent affinities for Na+ than corresponding porters from B. alcalophilus. At high concentrations of Na+, the porters from the two species were functionally similar. These findings support the argument that the absence of a growth requirement for added Na+ may reflect an ability of at least some bacteria to effectively utilize and recycle the available levels of Na+ that contaminate all media, rather than reflect true Na+ independence. Studies with a nonalkalophilic derivative of B. firmus RAB confirmed earlier findings with B. alcalophilus of a pleiotropic loss of Na+ coupling to porters in nonalkalophilic mutants."

https://openalex.org/W1561648831,"The endocytosis of histones by cultured cells was examined by flow cytofluorometry. Monolayer cultures of Chinese hamster ovary cells were incubated with fluorescein-labeled histone for various periods of time and then trypsinized to remove surface-bound protein. Internalization followed first order kinetics with a half-time of 45 min, and was linear in histone concentration up to 80 microgram/ml. Since fluorescein fluorescence decreases with decreasing pH, the fluorescence of labeled histone contained in lysosomes was expected to be decreased relative to its fluorescence at neutral pH. This was demonstrated by using chloroquine to increase the lysosomal pH of intact cells. The fluorescence of labeled histones incorporated into cells increased when those cells were incubated with 50 microM chloroquine and remeasured. This provides a method for measuring the kinetics of entry of a fluorescent probe into lysosomes. Internalization into lysosomes began almost immediately upon addition of histone, but stable nonlysosomal fluorescence appeared only after a lag of 1 h. Using suspension cultures, the short term binding and internalization kinetics were also measured. In pulse-chase experiments, lysosomal fluorescence decreased with a half-time of 30 min, but nonlysosomal fluorescence decreased with a half-time of almost 12 h, probably as a result of cell division. These results demonstrate the usefulness of flow cytometry for the quantitation and characterization of endocytosis in cultured cells."

https://openalex.org/W1656024959,"Aqueous extracts of exponentially growing human KB cells contain three quantitatively significant forms of DNA polymerase-alpha activity. The predominant form (about 70% of total cellular activity), which is recovered from the cytoplasm, has been previously purified to near-homogeneity and structurally characterized (Fisher, P. A., and Korn, D. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6528-6535). The other two polymerase forms include a minor cytoplasmic activity (about 20% of total cellular activity), DNA polymerase-alpha'; and a species that is tightly associated with detergent-purified nuclei (about 10% of total cellular activity), nuclear DNA polymerase-alpha. We have now purified both minor enzyme species to near-homogeneity and show that they are physically and enzymologically similar to the predominant cytoplasmic species. All three purified forms of KB polymerase-alpha behave as physically homogeneous 7 S species with minimum protomer molecular weights of about 140,000. By examining in vitro 14C-labeled enzyme fractions by high resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel fluorography, we demonstrate that the three purified species display a similar subunit structure composed of a quartet of polypeptides with molecular masses of 70,000, 65,000, 59,000, and 55,000 daltons, respectively. Extended fluorographic exposures of the gels fail to reveal the presence of any polypeptides larger than 70,000 daltons. It is our present interpretation, based on these and our previous observations, that the four polypeptides reflect microheterogeneity involving two primary species, and we do not yet know how they may associate to form the catalytically active protomer of 140,000 molecular weight. From arithmetical considerations, it is plausible that one or more pairwise combinations of them might suffice to generate the 7 S polymerase activity. These results thus corroborate the principal conclusions of our previous study of the structure of the KB cell cytoplasmic polymerase. In addition, they provide the first comparative analysis of the structure of multiple, operationally distinguishable polymerase-alpha forms obtained from a single tissue, as well as the first description of the purification and structural characterization of a nuclear DNA polymerase-alpha species from any source."

https://openalex.org/W1520551349,"Ricin A chain acts to inhibit protein synthesis only if it penetrates the plasma membrane, and this requires the participation of the B chain. The two chains are held together in ricin by a single disulfide bond. In this paper, it is shown that the addition of A chain to mouse leukemia cells (AKR SL3) after the cells were first reacted with purified ricin B chain also results in efficient inhibition of protein synthesis. The data indicated that B chain bound to the cell surface was capable of causing the transport of A chain. The quantities of ricin and of B chain (in the presence of a saturating amount of A chain) required to inhibit protein synthesis by 50% are nearly identical, indicating that there is little difference in the toxicity to cultured cells between ricin and the A chain-B chain heterodimer formed from purified subunits. However, if the addition of A chain to B chain-treated cells was delayed sufficiently long (90 to 120 min), B chain was no longer able to cause A chain transport and the consequent inhibition of protein synthesis. Direct binding studies indicated that only a fraction of the bound 125I-B chain was internalized during this time. No proteolytic degradation of 125I-B chain could be detected after 3 h incubation with the cells."

https://openalex.org/W1504269396,"Abstract DNA synthesis in vitro was studied in rat giant trophoblast nuclei from parietal yolk sacs at Day 13 of development. These nuclei synthesize DNA by a series of endoreduplications in the absence of mitosis. Although the nuclei contain DNA polymerase alpha and beta activities, polymerase alpha activity is not expressed since DNA synthesis is insensitive to aphidicolin. In contrast, N-ethylmaleimide and the DNA polymerase beta inhibitors, 50 mM potassium phosphate, and 2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate inhibit DNA synthesis in isolated nuclei to a degree identical with that seen with partially purified trophoblast DNA polymerase beta, suggesting that polymerase beta is the major polymerase activity in Day 13 trophoblast nuclei. DNA synthesis by these nuclei is dependent on ATP and inhibited by novobiocin and has been shown to be replicative rather than repair-type synthesis, since the newly synthesized DNA is contiguous with DNA replicated in vivo in the presence of a bromodeoxyuridine density label. The results suggest that DNA endoreduplication in these nuclei is being carried out by DNA polymerase beta."
https://openalex.org/W1601078380,"The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a key enzyme of juvenile hormone biosynthesis, have been measured in the supernatants of homogenates (10,000 x g) prepared from the corpora allata of the adult tobacco hornworm moth, Manduca sexta. Enzyme activity was inhibited 80% by 50 mM NaF, a known phosphoprotein phosphatase inhibitor, if present during extirpation of the glands and all subsequent workup of the tissue. Reductase activity was also significantly decreased (20-30%) in homogenates preincubated with 4 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM ATP. These results provide evidence that reductase in the insect undergoes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation similar to that occurring with reductase of mammalian liver. If so, this would provide a rapid method for modulating juvenile hormone synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1520155914,"In order to facilitate the study of motions of the carbohydrate moiety of glycoproteins, a method of enzymatically attaching uniformly 13C-enriched galactopyranose ([U-13C]galactose) onto the nonreducing end of the carbohydrate chain has been developed. Specifically, [U-13C]glucose (20% 13C) was converted through a sequence of four enzymatic steps to [U-13C]UDP-galactose which was then attached, via a beta-1,4 glycosidic bond, to a nonreducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine of hen ovalbumin using the enzyme bovine galactosyltransferase. The overall reaction was followed using 31P and 13C NMR. 13C NMR spectra of the modified ovalbumin show six well resolved resonances arising from the six carbons of the attached [U-13C]galactose. Values of the spin-lattice relaxation time, the line width, the 13C (1H) nuclear Overhauser effect, and the intensity ratio, a measure of the off-resonance rotating frame spin-lattice relaxation time, were obtained for the individual carbons of the [U13-C]galactose as well as other carbon resonances of the protein. Relaxation data for the protein alpha-carbon and aromatic methine carbon resonances could be fit to theoretical values by assuming a correlation time of 25 ns for overall isotropic motion of the glycoprotein. Relaxation data for the anomeric carbon of the attached [U-13C]galactose could only be fit by assuming an additional correlation time between 40 and 80 ps for free internal motion, subject to the constraint that its carbon-proton bond vector makes an angle of about 30 degrees with an effective axis of rotation."
https://openalex.org/W1489879467,"Reconstitution of bacteriorhodopsin into vesicles has been studied using individual and defined mixtures of fractionated Halobacterium halobium polar lipids. The lipids varied greatly in their ability to form vesicles that translocated protons and showed stimulation by valinomycin. Thus, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate gave mainly lipid-protein aggregates, while glycolipid sulfate gave mainly functional vesicles. Addition of glycolipid sulfate to phosphatidylglycerol phosphate promoted vesicle formation. Reconstitutions performed with different combinations of the purified lipids showed: 1) that vesicles with maximal proton pumping are obtained with a mixture of phosphatidylglycerol phosphate and glycolipid sulfate at a ratio close to that found in the purple membrane; 2) increasing the concentration of glycolipid sulfate in vesicles increases the stimulation of proton translocation by valinomycin; 3) phosphatidylglycerol sulfate cannot replace glycolipid sulfate or phosphatidylglycerol phosphate, and 4) vesicles containing sulfated polar lipids only are inferior to those in which liquid combinations containing phosphatidylglycerol phosphate are used."
https://openalex.org/W1673993169,"An in vitro reconstitution of both methylene blue and oxygen-dependent H2 uptake activity from extracts of Hup- (H2 uptake-negative) mutant strains of Rhizobium japonicum bacteroids is described. Cell-free extracts prepared from bacteroids formed from two different Hup- mutants were mixed, and active H2 oxidizing particles formed. Extracts from each mutant alone did not oxidize H2. The source of the components required for the complementation were soluble. Mixing of membrane particles from the two mutants did not result in reconstituted activity. The development of activity required an incubation period of several hours under anaerobic conditions, and maximal activity was obtained approximately 10 h after the mixing of the two extracts. Along with the development of H2 uptake activity with time, the soluble extract mixture became turbid. The turbidity could be correlated with an increase in the appearance of membrane structures, including closed vesicles. After reconstitution, 65% of the methylene blue-dependent H2 uptake activity was recovered in a particulate fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1481238452,"Incubation of human hemoglobin (Hb) A with glycineamide (Gly-NH2) in the presence of trypsin gives rise to two bands of approximately equal amount on the isoelectric focusing gel. Structural analyses, including digestion with trypsin and carboxypeptidases A and B, have shown that one is unmodified Hb A and the other is Gly-NH2(142 alpha) Hb in which Gly-NH2 is bound to the COOH-terminal residue of the alpha subunit (Arg 141 alpha) via peptide bond. Gly-NH2(142 alpha) Hb exhibits slightly increased affinity for oxygen and slightly reduced heme-heme interaction as compared with normal Hb A. Although Gly-NH2(142 alpha) Hb exhibits normal 2,3-diphosphoglycerate effect, the alkaline Bohr effect and chloride effect are diminished. These oxygen binding properties are attributable to abolished binding of chloride to the anion binding site positioned between the alpha-amino group of Val 1 alpha and the guanidinium group of Arg 141 alpha. Gly-NH2(142 alpha) Hb restores normal oxygen binding properties upon trypsin digestion which removes Gly-NH2 from the COOH terminus of the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W207484259,"The fungal toxin alpha-amanitin binds very tightly to RNA polymerase II (Kd approximately 10(-9) M) and inhibits the polymerizing activity of the enzyme. However, it has been unclear from previous studies whether or not this inhibition can be reversed. We show in this communication that it is possible to reverse the amanitin inhibition of polymerase by using a novel photoreactivation technique. When the inactive amanitin-wheat germ polymerase II complex is exposed to ultraviolet irradiation of a wavelength which is absorbed by the amanitin but not by the polymerase (monochromatic 314-nm irradiation), the enzyme recovers virtually all of the activity that an uninhibited control exhibits. Ultraviolet irradiation of a wavelength which is not absorbed significantly by the amanitin (monochromatic 350-nm irradiation) does not reactivate the inhibited polymerase. This ability to photoreactivate polymerase is discussed with respect to the mechanism of action of amanitin inhibition. Also discussed is the use of this technique for photoelution of an amanitin-Sepharose affinity column which we are developing for the isolation of transcriptionally active chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1487178988,"Abstract Changes in the solubility of both components of binary mixtures of sickle-cell deoxyhemoglobin (Hb degrees S) and some normally nonaggregating hemoglobins were determined by direct compositional analysis of the solution phage following sedimentation of crystalline aggregates generated from them. Increases in turbidity associated with the suspension of the crystals in solution were also monitored for each mixture. Correlations between changes in species solubility and excess' turbidity levels were observed which define two distinct forms of interaction between hemoglobin additives and Hb degrees S. The R-state quaternary structures, COHbS and metHbS in the absence of organic phosphate, are excluded from the aggregate phase and act to lower the solubility of Hb degrees S through increased excluded volume contributions to the activity of the solution phase. Increases in turbidity which parallel this solubility change reflect the increased population of highly asymmetric Hb degrees C crystals in solution. Deoxyhemoglobin A and metHbS fixed in the deoxy conformation lower the solubility of Hb degrees S in a more complex manner, which may include the establishment of a minimum solubility. The solubility of these additives also decreases, as does the turbidity due to the resultant crystals, when the proportion of additive exceeds 40% of the total. Analysis of the composition of pellets isolated from both hybrid and nonhybrid mixtures with Hb degrees A confirms its incorporation into the aggregates. Such mixed crystals appear to have solubility and morphological properties different from those of Hb degrees S alone. Comparison of phase composition data from mixtures prepared with varying initial concentrations of Hb degrees S suggests that the degree of HbA incorporation into HbS aggregates is a function of the amount of Hb degrees S itself available for self-aggregation and the stage of crystal development at which HbA participates."
