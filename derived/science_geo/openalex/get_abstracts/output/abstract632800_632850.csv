The selectivity occurs even among highly related GPCRs. For example, five subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1R to M5R) play different roles in the nervous system by binding to different G proteins. Maeda et al. determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of M1R and M2R bound to their respective G proteins. A side-by-side comparison provided a molecular understanding of G protein–coupling selectivity. Science , this issue p. 552"

Bacteria use metalloenzymes to catalyze methane oxidation to methanol, a reaction of industrial interest. Understanding the metal sites that enable this reaction may inspire new biomimetic catalysts. Ross et al. used spectroscopic measurements to assign two monocopper sites in the enzyme particulate methane monooxygenase. These results differ in part from previous proposals for the location and nuclearity of the metal sites and will prompt rethinking about how this metalloenzyme catalyzes methane oxidation.

Musilova et al. analyzed more than 100 deep-sea fish genomes and found a previously unknown proliferation of rod opsin genes that generate rod opsin photopigments that are tuned to different wavelengths of light. These receptors may allow the fish to perceive bioluminescent signals that pervade their deep-sea environment. These results reveal a previously undescribed visual system that allows for color vision in the dark. Science , this issue p. 588"
https://openalex.org/W2943879438,"Afferents modulate newborn neurons What is the role of adult neurogenesis in learning, memory, and mood? Luna et al. found that adult-born neurons either inhibited or excited the dentate gyrus, depending on whether synaptic inputs originated from the lateral or the medial entorhinal cortex (see the Perspective by Llorens-Martín). These opposing mechanisms were driven by extrasynaptic transmission from adult-born neurons directly onto mature granule cells via metabotropic glutamate receptors or N -methyl- D -aspartate receptors, respectively. The balance between these mechanisms could explain the differences in dentate gyrus activity during two versions of an active place-avoidance task. The action of adult-born neurons thus depended entirely on the demands of the environment, which can be defined by the activity of cortical and subcortical regions sending inputs to the dentate gyrus.

https://openalex.org/W2944488762,"The identification of phosphorus (P) fractions is essential for understanding the transformation and availability of P in paddy soils. To investigate the soil P fractions associated with soil properties under long-term fertilization, we selected three fertilization treatments, including no fertilization (CK), chemical fertilizers (NPK) and chemical fertilizers combined with manure (NPKM), from three long-term experiments located in Nanchang (NC), Jinxian (JX) and Ningxiang (NX). The results showed that chemical fertilizers combined with manure (NPKM) significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased the soil total phosphorus, Olsen P and soil organic matter (SOM) by 2, 3 and 1 times, respectively, compared with the NPK treatment, and by 4, 17 and 2 times, respectively, compared with the CK treatment. NPKM significantly increased the grain yield compared with CK and NPK at all sites. The apparent P balance with NPK was higher in NC and NX but lower in JX compared with NPKM. Hedley fractionation revealed the predominance of most of the organic and inorganic phosphorus (Po and Pi) fractions with long-term fertilization, especially with the NPKM treatment, at all sites. The nonlabile P pool decreased by 14% and 18% whereas the moderately labile P pool proportions increased by 3 and 6 times with the NPK and NPKM treatments, respectively, compared to the CK treatment. The labile P pool showed a significant positive relationship with the SOM, total P and Olsen P contents. The moderately labile P was positively correlated with the total P and Olsen P. A significant positive correlation was observed between soil pH and the nonlabile P pool. Redundancy analysis revealed that the moderately labile P fraction (HCl dil. Pi fraction) was remarkably increased by the NPKM treatment and significantly correlated with the soil pH and total P concentration. The labile P fraction (NaHCO3-Pi) showed a strong relationship with the Olsen P and total P. However, the residual P fraction was negatively correlated with the HCl. dil. Pi fraction. We concluded that NPKM application improved P availability by many folds compared to NPK, which could lead to environmental pollution; therefore, the rate of combined application of manure and chemical fertilizer should be reduced compared to chemical fertilizer inputs to minimize the wastage of resources and environmental P losses."

https://openalex.org/W2944741247,"Introduction Routine cervical screening has been shown to greatly reduce both the number of new cervical cancers diagnosed each year and the number of deaths resulting from the disease. Nevertheless, cervical screening knowledge and screening uptake is very low in developing countries. In Ethiopia, the coverage of cervical cancer screening is only 1%. In this study, we aimed to assess cervical cancer screening knowledge and barriers for screening uptake among women in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2015 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total of 520 women were selected by a multi-stage sampling procedure. Interview based questioner was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the socio-demographic and clinical profiles of the women. Multivariate logistic regression using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to identify independent predictors for cervical screening knowledge. A p-value of <0.05 was set to determine level of statistical significance. Results Among all women, 42.7% had heard of cervical cancer screening and 144 (27.7%) women had adequate knowledge of cervical cancer screening. The mean (±SD) age of women was 27.7 (±5.49) years. In total, a quarter (25%) of eligible women had experience of cervical cancer screening. Not being married (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.8, 1.1–3.3), having an awareness of cervical cancer (AOR = 5.0, 2.7–9.1) and receiving information from health professionals (AOR = 1.9, 1.1–3.2) were the predictors for good cervical cancer screening knowledge. An absence of symptoms (57%), a lack of knowledge about screening (56.3%) and the lack of a screening service in their living area (42.2%) were the perceived barriers for screening uptake. Conclusions Cervical screening knowledge was low among women and less than half had heard of screening. Women also had low experience of screening. The lack of a screening service, the absence of symptoms and not knowing about screening were the perceived reasons for the low uptake. Hence, awareness campaigns and education should be undertaken by health professionals. Access and availability of screening service is also essential to improve screening uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2943985492,"Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is part of the first steps in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is a cytokine belonging to the Transforming Growth Factor β superfamily and its expression is increased both during ED and in CVD. Because high blood levels of GDF15 have been reported during ED, we hypothesized that GDF15 could be produced by endothelial cells in response to a vascular stress, possibly to attenuate endothelial function loss. Since senescence is mainly involved in both vascular stress and endothelial function loss, we used Endothelial Colony Forming Cells generated from adult blood (AB-ECFCs) as a model of endothelial cells to investigate GDF15 expression during cellular senescence. Then, we analyzed the potential role of GDF15 in AB-ECFC functions and senescence. When AB-ECFCs become senescent, they secrete increased levels of GDF15. We investigated GDF15 paracrine effects on non-senescent AB-ECFCs and showed that GDF15 enhanced proliferation, migration, NO production and activated several signaling pathways including AKT, ERK1/2 and SMAD2 without triggering any oxidative stress. Taken together, our results suggest that GDF15 production by senescent AB-ECFCs could act in a paracrine manner on non-senescent AB-ECFCs, and that this interaction could be beneficial to its model cells. Therefore, GDF15 could play a beneficial role in a dysfunctional vascular system as previously reported in patients with CVD, by limiting ED related to vascular stress occurring in these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2944225728,"The path to elimination Measles is highly infectious and can be dangerous. The classic 1968 vaccine is highly effective, and it should be possible to eliminate measles. Graham et al. found that measles transmission changes as vaccination coverage and birth rates (that is, the rate of arrival of susceptible individuals into the population) change in a country in response to socioeconomic variables. As a result, measles everywhere follows the canonical mode of decline in response to vaccination campaigns. Incidence is initially high, and variability is low. As incidence declines, variability increases, and as incidence drops toward elimination, so does variability. It is possible to identify countries that are deviating from this expectation and to adapt their vaccination programs to regain the path to elimination. Science , this issue p. 584"
https://openalex.org/W2944299830,"Background The consequences of armed conflicts impose considerable burdens on the economy and health care services, particularly in countries that are not equipped to deal with them, such as in the Middle-East, and North African countries. Little is known about the burden of mortality and injury resulting from the Libyan armed conflict. This study aimed to determine the trends and patterns of mortality, injury and disabilities directly associated with the Libyan armed conflict and analyze the geographic variation within the country during 2012–2107. Methods Data on conflict-related deaths, injuries, and disabilities were obtained from the national registry offices. The information included date, place, and demographic information. A questionnaire was also used to obtain information from the affected individuals and their families. National and regional trends of mortality, injury and disabilities were calculated. Spatial analysis was performed using geographic data available on all documented cases to analyze clustering of mortality and injury. Results A total of 16,126 deaths and 42,633 injuries were recorded with complete information during the Libyan conflict from 2012 till 2017. The overall mortality rate was 2.7/1000 population and injury rate was 7.1/1000. The overall male-to-female ratio of mortality and injury was 4.4:1; 42.3% were single and aged 20–30 years old, and 26.4% were aged 31–40 years. Moreover, injuries resulted in death in 20.1% of cases and disability in 33.5% of the cases. Most of the disabilities were caused by blasts, while gun shots resulted in more deaths. The overall mortality and injury rates were highest during 2015–2017. These rates were highest in the eastern region. Injuries were most concentrated in Benghazi and Derna in the east, followed by Sert and Musrata in the central region. Conclusions Conflict-related mortality, injury and disability has inflicted a heavy burden on the Libyan society that may persist for a long time. The rates of these casualties varied in time and place. National, well-planned efforts are needed to address this serious situation and its consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2944500530,"Genetic modification of farm animals has not been well accepted by the public. Some modifications have the potential to improve animal welfare. One such example is the use of gene editing (i.e. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)) to spread the naturally occurring POLLED gene, as these genetically hornless animals would not need to experience the painful procedures used to remove the horns or horn buds. The aim of the current study was to assess public attitudes regarding the use of GM to produce polled cattle. United States (US) citizens (n = 598), recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk, were asked “Do you think genetically modifying cows to be hornless would be…”, and responded using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = a very bad thing, 4 = neither good nor bad, 7 = a very good thing). Participants were then asked to indicate if they would be willing to consume products from these modified animals. We excluded 164 of the original 598 participants for not completing the survey, failing any of three attention check questions, or providing no or unintelligible qualitative responses. Respondents were then asked to provide a written statement explaining their answers; these reasons were subjected to qualitative analysis. Comparison of Likert scale ratings between two groups was done using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and comparisons between more than two groups were done using the Kruskal-Wallis rank test. More people responded that the modification would be good (Likert ≥ 5; 65.7%) than bad (Likert ≤ 3; 23.1%), and that they would be willing to consume products from these animals (Likert ≥ 5; 66.0%) versus not consume these products (Likert ≤ 3; 22.6%). Qualitative analysis of the text responses showed that participant reasoning was based on several themes including animal welfare, uncertainty about the technology, and worker well-being. In conclusion, many participants reported positive attitudes towards GM polled cattle; we suggest that people may be more likely to support GM technologies when these are perceived to benefit the animal."
https://openalex.org/W2944041857,"Hyaluronic acid injections have been a mainstay of arthritis treatment for decades. However, much controversy remains about their clinical efficacy and their potential mechanism of action. This approach to arthritis therapy is often called viscosupplementation, a term which is rooted in the elevated viscosity of the injected solutions. This terminology also suggests a mechanical pathway of action and further implies that their efficacy is dependent on viscosity. Notably, previous studies of the relationship between viscous properties of hyaluronic acid solutions and their clinical efficacy have not been definitive. Recently we developed an experimental and analytical framework for studying cartilage lubrication that captures the Stribeck-like behavior of cartilage in an elastoviscous transition curve. Here we apply this framework to study the lubricating behavior of six hyaluronan products currently used for injectable arthritis therapy in the US. Despite the fact that the source and chemical modifications endow these products with a range of lubricating properties, we show that the lubricating effect of all of these materials can be described by this Stribeck-like elastoviscous transition. Fitting this data to the elastoviscous transition model enables the calculation of effective lubricating viscosities for each material, which differ substantially from the viscosities measured using standard rheometry. Further we show that while data from standard rheometry are poor predictors of clinical performance of these materials, measurements of friction coefficient and effective lubricating viscosity correlate well (R2 = 0.77; p < 0.005) with assessments of improved clinical function reported previously. This approach offers both a novel method that can be used to evaluate potential clinical efficacy of hyaluronic acid formulations and provide new insight on their mode of action."
https://openalex.org/W2944186884,"Introduction Understanding socio-economic correlates and inequality of underweight and overweight is crucial to develop interventions to prevent adverse health outcomes. Materials and methods We analysed Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data from 6,069 women aged 15–49 years. WHO cut-offs for Body Mass Index categorised as: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5kg/m2 to 24.9kg/m2) and overweight/ obesity (> = 25.0 kg/m2) were used. We used multinomial logistic regression to explore associations of factors with Body Mass Index and concentration indices to estimate socio-economic inequalities. Results Higher risk of underweight was found in age group 15–19 (RRR 3.08, 95% CI: 2.29–4.15), 20–29 (RRR 1.64, 95% CI: 1.29–2.08) and in lowest (RRR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.03–2.47) and second wealth quintiles (RRR 1.77 (95% CI: 1.18–2.64). Education, occupation, urban/rural residence and food security were not associated with underweight (p>0.05). Lower risk of overweight/obesity was found in age group 15–19 (RRR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.05–0.10), 20–29 (RRR 0.40, 95% CI: 0.32–0.51), in manual occupation (RRR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.46–0.74) and in lower quintiles. Women with primary (RRR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.36–2.67), secondary education (RRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00, 2.01) were at increased risk of overweight/obesity. Household food security and urban/rural residence were not associated with overweight/obesity (p>0.05). Socioeconomic inequalities were detected, with overweight/obesity strongly concentrated (concentration index: 0.380) amongst the higher quintiles and underweight concentrated (concentration index: -0.052) amongst the poorest. Conclusion Nutrition programmes should target younger and poor women to address undernutrition and higher wealth group women to address overnutrition. Equity based nutrition interventions improving socio-economic status of poor households may benefit undernourished women. Interventions to encourage physical activity as women age and among wealthier women as well as healthy eating for prevention of under- and over-nutrition are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2944310230,"This paper combines a Granger causality test and a VAR model to investigate the relationships among oil price shocks, global economic policy uncertainty (GEPU), and China’s industrial economic growth. Based on monthly data from 2000 to 2017, we reveal that GEPU and world oil prices jointly Granger cause China's industrial economic growth; world oil prices have a positive effect on China's industrial economic growth, while GEPU has a negative effect. Further analyses investigate the asymmetry effect of oil prices and find that the negative component shows a more significant impact on China's industrial economic growth. The results are robust to different oil price and EPU proxies."
https://openalex.org/W2944042063,"Background Although prior research into the relationship between volume and outcome indicates that this relationship is not linear and that an optimal volume should be specified, consensus is lacking regarding the ideal value of this optimal volume. The purposes of this study were to use a visual method to identify surgeon- and hospital-volume thresholds and to examine the relationships of surgeon and hospital volume thresholds to 30-day readmission. Methods A retrospective nationwide population-based study design was adopted. Patients who received total knee replacement surgery between 2007 and 2008 in any hospital in Taiwan were included. After adjusting for patient, physician, and hospital characteristics, a restricted cubic spline regression model was used to identify optimal surgeon- and hospital-volume thresholds. Further, a patient-level mixed effect model was conducted to test the respective relationships between these thresholds and 30-day readmission. Results A total of 30,828 patients who had received their surgeries from 1,468 surgeons in 437 hospitals were included in this study. Thresholds of 50 cases a year for surgeons and 75 cases a year for hospitals were identified using a restricted cubic spline regression model. However, only the surgeon volume threshold was associated with 30-day readmission using a patient-level mixed effect model after adjusting for patient-, surgeon- and hospital-level covariates. Conclusions According to the results of the restricted cubic spline models, the optimal volume thresholds for surgeons and hospitals are 50 cases and 75 cases a year, respectively. However, only the surgeon volume threshold is associated with 30-day readmission."
https://openalex.org/W2944717534,"Glioma is the most common type of primary brain tumor, accounting for 40% of malignant brain tumors. Although a single gene may not be a marker, an expression profiling and multivariate analyses for cancer immunotherapy must estimate survival of patients. In this study, we conducted expression profiling of immunotherapy-related genes, including those in Th1/2 helper T and regulatory T cells, and stimulatory and inhibitory checkpoint molecules associated with survival prediction in 571 patients with malignant and aggressive form of gliomas, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Expression profiling and Random forests analysis of 21 immunosuppressive genes and Kaplan-Meier analysis in 158 patients in the training data set suggested that CD276, also known as B7-H3, could be a single gene marker candidate. Furthermore, prognosis prediction formulas, composed of Th2 cell-related GATA transcription factor 3 (GATA3) and immunosuppressive galactose-specific lectin 3 (LGALS3), based on 67 immunotherapy-related genes showed poor survival with high scores in training data set, which was also validated in another 413 patients in the test data set. The CD276 expression helped distinguish survival curves in the test data set. In addition, inhibitory checkpoint genes, including T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, V-set domain containing T cell activation inhibitor 1, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing 3, and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 14, showed potential as secondary marker candidates. These results suggest that CD276 expression and the gene signature composed of GATA3 and LGALS3 are effective for prognosis in GBM and will help us understanding target pathways for immunotherapy in GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2944428999,"The Caucasian lynx, Lynx lynx dinniki, has one of the southernmost distributions in the Eurasian lynx range, covering Anatolian Turkey, the Caucasus and Iran. Little is known about the biology and the genetic status of this subspecies. To collect baseline genetic, ecological and behavioural data and benefit future conservation of L. l. dinniki, we monitored 11 lynx territories (396 km2) in northwestern Anatolia. We assessed genetic diversity of this population by non-invasively collecting 171 faecal samples and trapped and sampled 12 lynx individuals using box traps. We observed high allelic variation at 11 nuclear microsatellite markers, and found no signs of inbreeding despite the potential isolation of this population. We obtained similar numbers of distinct genotypes from the two sampling sources. Our results indicated that first order female relatives occupy neighbouring territories (female philopatry) and that territorial male lynx were highly unrelated to each other and to female territorial lynx, suggesting long distance male dispersal. Particular male and female resident territorial lynx and their offspring (kittens and subadults) were more likely to be trapped than resident floaters or dispersing (unrelated) lynx. Conversely, we obtained more data for unrelated lynx and higher numbers of territorials using non-invasive sampling (faeces). When invasive and non-invasive samples were analysed separately, the spatial organisation of lynx (in terms of female philopatry and females and males occupying permanent ranges) affected measures of genetic diversity in such a way that estimates of genetic diversity were reduced if only invasive samples were considered. It appears that, at small spatial scales, invasive sampling using box traps may underestimate the genetic diversity in carnivores with permanent ranges and philopatry such as the Eurasian lynx. As non-invasive sampling can also provide additional data on diet and spatial organisation, we advocate the use of such samples for conservation genetic studies of vulnerable, endangered or data deficient territorial species."
https://openalex.org/W2944750067,"Brasilodon quadrangularis (Cynodontia, Probainognathia) is an iconic non-mammaliaform cynodont from the Late Triassic of Brazil (Riograndia Assemblage Zone, Candelária Sequence), being considered as the sister taxon of Mammaliaformes. Although its phylogenetic position is very important, several aspects of its postcranial anatomy remain unclear or unstudied. Here, we present a detailed description of the postcranial elements referred to Brasilodon, including previously mentioned specimens and new ones, which add relevant information about its postcranial morphology and provide a new insight into the anatomical transition between advanced non-mammaliaform cynodonts and early mammaliaforms. Functional and ecological implications are also investigated, based on the postcranial morphology and muscular reconstructions. The postcranium of Brasilodon differs from most non-mammaliaform cynodonts and presents similarities with tritylodontids, early mammaliaforms and extant therians, such as a ventrally oriented scapular glenoid facet, a distinct and ossified greater humeral tubercle, lack of ectepicondylar foramen, olecranon process, hemispherical humeral and femoral heads and a prominent intertrochanteric crest. The humeral torsion, the length of the deltopectoral crest, the large bicipital groove and the well-developed lesser tubercle, indicate that the forelimb of Brasilodon was hold in a semi-sprawling position, with well-developed adductor muscles to maintain the body off the ground. The short femoral neck and the strong medial projection of the femoral head indicate the femur was held in a more erect posture than in basal non-mammaliaform cynodonts. The anterodorsally projected iliac blade with reduced postacetabular process, reduction of the anterior part of the pubis, medially located lesser trochanter indicate a basically mammalian pattern of pelvic musculature, able to swing the femur in a nearly parasagittal plane."
https://openalex.org/W2944372388,"Ordinary language users group colours into categories that they refer to by a name e.g. pale green. Data on the colour categories of English speakers was collected using online crowd sourcing - 1,000 subjects produced 20,000 unconstrained names for 600 colour stimuli. From this data, using the framework of Information Geometry, a Riemannian metric was computed throughout the RGB cube. This is the first colour metric to have been computed from colour categorization data. In this categorical metric the distance between two close colours is determined by the difference in the distribution of names that the subject population applied to them. This contrasts with previous colour metrics which have been driven by stimulus discriminability, or acceptability of a colour match. The categorical metric is analysed and shown to be clearly different from discriminability-based metrics. Natural units of categorical length, area and volume are derived. These allow a count to be made of the number of categorically-distinct regions of categorically-similar colours that fit within colour space. Our analysis estimates that 27 such regions fit within the RGB cube, which agrees well with a previous estimate of 30 colours that can be identified by name by untrained subjects."

Despite their detection in almost all archaea, there are few reports investigating the structural properties of these proteins, with no reports exploring this topic for halophilic S-layers. The objective of the present study was to investigate the secondary and tertiary organization of the Haloferax volcanii S-layer protein. Such investigations were performed using circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The protein secondary structure is centered on β-sheets and is affected by environmental pH, with higher disorder in more alkaline conditions. The pH can also affect the protein's tertiary structure, with higher tryptophan side-chain exposure to the medium under the same conditions. The concentrations of Na, Mg and Ca ions in the environment also affect the protein structures, with small changes in α-helix and β-sheet content, as well as changes in tryptophan side chain exposure. These changes in turn influence the protein's functional properties, with cell envelope preparations revealing striking differences when in different salt conditions. Thermal denaturation assays revealed that the protein is stable. It has been reported that the S-layer protein N-glycosylation process is affected by external factors and the present study indicates for the first time changes in the protein structure."

We designed 85 sequence-specific PCR reactions to detect 79 genes or mutations associated with resistance across 10 major antimicrobial classes, with a focus on E. coli. The 85 qPCR assays demonstrated >99.9% concordance with sequencing. We evaluated the correlation between genotypic resistance markers and phenotypic susceptibility results on 239 E. coli isolates. Both sensitivity and specificity exceeded 90% for ampicillin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol phenotypic susceptibility results. We then evaluated the assays on direct stool specimens and observed a sensitivity of 97% ± 5 but, as expected, a lower specificity of 75% ± 31 versus the genotype of the E. coli cultured from stool. Finally, the assays were incorporated into a convenient TaqMan Array Card (TAC) format. These assays may be useful for tracking AMR in E. coli isolates or directly in stool for targeted testing of the fecal antibiotic resistome."

Proposed methods operate by employing the GoF tests locally on the wavelet coefficients of a noisy image obtained via discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) respectively. We next formulate image denoising as a binary hypothesis testing problem with the null hypothesis indicating the presence of noise and the alternate hypothesis representing the presence of desired signal only. The decision that a given wavelet coefficient corresponds to the null hypothesis or the alternate hypothesis involves the GoF testing based on empirical distribution function (EDF), applied locally on the noisy wavelet coefficients. The performance of the proposed methods is validated by comparing them against the state of the art image denoising methods."
https://openalex.org/W2944020701,"The general problem is lack of inter-professional collaboration and the way private primary care responds to manage chronic diseases in Malaysia. Absence of prescription review, inadequate patient education, the highest percentage of prescribing errors and half of the chronic disease patients are nonadherent. Medicines are the most common and life long used interventions in chronic diseases. Hence, the need to manage medicine in chronic diseases becomes obligatory. As both general practitioner and community pharmacist can dispense medications, this has resulted in a business rivalry. There is a need to build consensus among various healthcare stakeholders for a collaborative medication therapy management model (CMTM) where community pharmacist has an active role in chronic care.This study utilized modified e-Delphi method to build consensus. A validated e-Delphi survey was administered to a purposive sample of 29 experts. Consensus was pre-defined to be the point where >85% of the experts fall in either agree or strongly agree category for each statement. The inter-expert agreement was computed in both rounds using Intra-class correlation coefficient and Kendall's W. Delphi operates in an iterative fashion till there comes stability in responses. At the end of each round, experts were provided aggregate response, their own response and choice to change their response in the light of aggregate response.Response rate was 70.73% and 100% in 1st and 2nd round, respectively. Consensus was achieved on 119/132 statements which mainly referred to the need, structural and regulatory aspects of CMTM model in Malaysia. However, there were some flashpoints on dispensing separation and means to finance this model. Stability in response of experts was achieved after 2nd round; hence, no next round was executed.Overall, the study findings witnessed the expert panel's support for the CMTM model. Study helped to sketch CMTM model and facilitated development of some recommendations to the authorities which may help to formulate a policy to bring CPs under a working relationship with GPs. Hence, this study should be taken as a call for redefining of the roles of CPs and GPs in Malaysia."

The addition of a health-promoting, probiotic bacterium to these products ensures the delivery of that probiotic activity to consumers. Here, we assess the microbial community of a traditional Senegalese milk product produced by spontaneous fermentation, called lait caillé. We produced the lait caillé in a traditional way and added a probiotic starter containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 to the traditional process. We found various species that are known for their ability to ferment milk, including species from the genera Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus. Our results show that the addition of L. rhamnosus to the inoculum, can result in detectable levels of this strain in the final product, ranging between 0.2 and 1 percent of the total bacterial population. Subsequent rounds of fermentation using passive back-slopping without the addition of new L. rhamnosus led to a loss of this strain from the community of fermenting bacteria. Our results suggest that the addition of probiotic strains at every fermentation cycle can enrich the existing complex communities of traditionally fermented lait caillé while traditional bacterial strains remain dominant in the bacterial communities."

Here, we show that immersion of brain sections in specific OCAs (FocusClear, RIMS, sRIMS, or ScaleSQ) affects both their transparency and volume; the optical clearing effect occurs over the entire visible spectrum and is reversible; and that ScaleSQ had the highest optical clearing potential and increase in imaging depth of the four evaluated OCAs, albeit with the largest change in sample volume and a concomitant decrease in apparent microvascular density of the sample. These results suggest a rational, quantitative framework for screening and characterization of the impact of optical clearing, to streamline experimental design and enable a cost-benefit assessment."

Therefore, effective and preferably cost-effective preventive interventions are warranted. Freezing meat intended for raw or undercooked consumption and improving biosecurity in pig farms are promising interventions to prevent Toxoplasma gondii infections in humans. Putting these interventions into practice would expectedly reduce the number of infections; however, the net benefits for society are unknown. Stakeholders bearing the costs for these interventions will not necessary coincide with the ones having the benefits. We performed a Social Cost-Benefit Analysis to evaluate the net value of two potential interventions for the Dutch society. We assessed the costs and benefits of the two interventions and compared them with the current practice of education, especially during pregnancy. A 'minimum scenario' and a 'maximum scenario' was assumed, using input parameters with least benefits to society and input parameters with most benefits to society, respectively. For both interventions, we performed different scenario analyses. The freezing meat intervention was far more effective than the biosecurity intervention. Despite high freezing costs, freezing two meat products: steak tartare and mutton leg yielded net social benefits in both the minimum and maximum scenario, ranging from €10.6 million to €31 million for steak tartare and €0.6 million to €1.5 million for mutton leg. The biosecurity intervention would result in net costs in all scenarios ranging from €1 million to €2.5 million, due to high intervention costs and limited benefits. From a public health perspective (i.e. reducing the burden of toxoplasmosis) and the societal perspective (i.e. a net benefit for the Dutch society) freezing steak tartare and leg of mutton is to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2944682253,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) are rodent-borne hantaviruses that are the primary causes of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia. The development of well characterized animal models of HTNV and PUUV infection is critical for the evaluation and the potential licensure of HFRS vaccines and therapeutics. In this study we present three animal models of HTNV infection (hamster, ferret and marmoset), and two animal models of PUUV infection (hamster, ferret). Infection of hamsters with a ~3 times the infectious dose 99% (ID99) of HTNV by the intramuscular and ~1 ID99 of HTNV by the intranasal route leads to a persistent asymptomatic infection, characterized by sporadic viremia and high levels of viral genome in the lung, brain and kidney. In contrast, infection of hamsters with ~2 ID99 of PUUV by the intramuscular or ~1 ID99 of PUUV by the intranasal route leads to seroconversion with no detectable viremia, and a transient detection of viral genome. Infection of ferrets with a high dose of either HTNV or PUUV by the intramuscular route leads to seroconversion and gradual weight loss, though kidney function remained unimpaired and serum viremia and viral dissemination to organs was not detected. In marmosets a 1,000 PFU HTNV intramuscular challenge led to robust seroconversion and neutralizing antibody production. Similarly to the ferret model of HTNV infection, no renal impairment, serum viremia or viral dissemination to organs was detected in marmosets. This is the first report of hantavirus infection in ferrets and marmosets."
https://openalex.org/W2952259028,"Background Although many genetic manipulations of crops providing biofortified or safer food have been done, the acceptance of biotechnology crops still remains limited. We report on a transgenic barley expressing the multi-functional protein osmotin that improves plant defense under stress conditions. Methods An Agrobacterium–mediated technique was used to transform immature embryos of the spring barley cultivar Golden Promise. Transgenic barley plants of the T0 and T1 generation were evaluated by molecular methods. Transgenic barley tolerance to stress was determined by chlorophyll, total protein, malondialdehyde and ascorbate peroxidase content. Methanol extracts of i) Fusarium oxysporum infected or ii) salt-stressed plants, were characterized by their acute toxicity effect on human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), genotoxicity and affection of biodiversity interactions, which was tested through monitoring barley natural virus pathogen–host interactions–the BYDV and WDV viruses transmitted to the plants by aphids and leafhoppers. Results Transgenic plants maintained the same level of chlorophyll and protein, which significantly declined in wild-type barley under the same stressful conditions. Salt stress evoked higher ascorbate peroxidase level and correspondingly less malondialdehyde. Osmotin expressing barley extracts exhibited a lower cytotoxicity effect of statistical significance than that of wild-type plants under both types of stress tested on human dermal fibroblasts. Extract of Fusarium oxysporum infected transgenic barley was not able to damage DNA in the Comet assay, which is in opposite to control plants. Moreover, this particular barley did not affect the local biodiversity. Conclusion Our findings provide a new perspective that could help to evaluate the safety of products from genetically modified crops."

https://openalex.org/W2944486423,"LDC3/Dynarrestin, an aminothiazole derivative, is a recently developed small molecule, which binds protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 (PTPIP51). PTPIP51 interacts with various proteins regulating different signaling pathways leading to proliferation and migration. Her2 positive breast cancer cells (SKBR3) express high levels of PTPIP51. Therefore, we investigated the effects of LDC3/Dynarrestin on PTPIP51 and its interactome with 12 different proteins of various signal pathways including the interaction with dynein in SKBR3 cells. The localization and semi-quantification of PTPIP51 protein and the Tyr176 phosphorylated PTPIP51 protein were evaluated. Protein-protein-interactions were assessed by Duolink proximity ligation assays. Interactions and the activation of signal transduction hubs were examined with immunoblots. LDC3/Dynarrestin led to an increased PTPIP51 tyrosine 176 phosphorylation status while the overall amount of PTPIP51 remained unaffected. These findings are paralleled by an enhanced interaction of PTPIP51 with its crucial kinase c-Src and a reduced interaction with the counteracting phosphatase PTP1B. Furthermore, the treatment results in a significantly augmented interaction of PTPIP51/14-3-3β and PTPIP51/Raf1, the link to the MAPK pathway. Under the influence of LDC3/Dynarrestin, the activity of the MAPK pathway rose in a concentration-dependent manner as indicated by RTK assays and immunoblots. The novel small molecule stabilizes the RelA/IκB/PTPIP51 interactome and can abolish the effects caused by TNFα stimulation. Moreover, LDC3/Dynarrestin completely blocked the Akt signaling, which is essential for tumor growth. The data were compared to the recently described interactome of PTPIP51 in LDC3/Dynarrestin treated non-cancerous keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). Differences were identified exclusively for the mitochondrial-associated ER-membranes (MAM) interactions and phospho-regulation related interactome of PTPIP51.LDC3/Dynarrestin gives the opportunity/possibility to influence the MAPK signaling, NFkB signaling and probably calcium homeostasis in breast cancer cells by affecting the PTPIP51 interactome."
https://openalex.org/W2944335397,"To estimate the risk of childhood obesity associated with the various criteria proposed for diagnosis of gestational diabetes (GDM), and the joint effects with maternal BMI.Cohort study of 46,396 women delivering at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care delivery system in 1995-2004 and their offspring, followed through 5-7 years of age. Pregnancy hyperglycemia was categorized according to the screening and oral glucose tolerance test values proposed for the diagnosis of GDM by the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG), Carpenter Coustan (CC), and the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG). Childhood obesity was defined by the International Obesity Task Force's age and sex-specific BMI cut-offs. Poisson regression models estimated the risks of childhood obesity associated with each category of pregnancy glycemia compared to normal screening, and the joint effects of maternal BMI category and GDM by the CC and the IADPSG criteria.Compared with normal screening, increased risks of childhood obesity were observed for abnormal screening [RR (95% CI): 1.30 (1.22, 1.38)], 1+ abnormal values by the IADPSG or CC [1.47 (1.36, 1.59) and 1.48 (1.37, 1.59), respectively], and 2+ values by CC or NDDG [1.52 (1.39, 1.67) and 1.60 (1.43, 1.78), respectively]. Compared to obese women without GDM, obese women with GDM defined by the CC criteria had significantly increased risk of childhood obesity [1.20 (1.07, 1.34)], which was also observed for GDM by the IADSPG [1.18 (1.07, 1.30)], though GDM did not significantly increase the risk of childhood obesity among normal weight or overweight women.The risk of childhood obesity starts to increase at levels of pregnancy glycemia below those used to diagnose GDM and the effect of GDM on childhood obesity risk appears more pronounced in women with obesity. Interventions to reduce obesity and pregnancy hyperglycemia are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2943978104,"I was nursing my wounds from my latest manuscript rejection when the email arrived. I was about 2 years into my assistant professorship, with the tenure clock running at full speed, and the pressure to publish was immense. I knew that navigating rejection was part of the job, but I was also starting to wonder whether my study—a modest project designed to be feasible with the minimal lab space and skeleton crew of a new professor—would ever see the light of day. So when I received the email from a newly launched journal inviting me to publish with them, I saw a lifeline. That's when my troubles started.

> “My stomach tightened. I had fallen prey to a predatory journal.” 

I had heard about “predatory” journals during my graduate training but had no experience with them. The email appeared legitimate. It spelled my name correctly, referenced some of my previous work, and used correct grammar. The journal wasn't on Beall's List of Predatory Journals and Publishers. I thought I had done my due diligence. I submitted my manuscript. Shortly after, I celebrated the first round of favorable reviews. Things were going great—or so I thought.

Maybe it was the daily emails requesting my revisions, but something started to seem off. I rechecked Beall's list—still nothing. I found that a postdoc at my institution was listed on the journal's website as a member of the editorial board. I sent him an email asking about his experience with the journal, hoping he would confirm its legitimacy. That's when the roof started to cave in. My colleague explained that he had never actually worked with the journal. He eventually realized that it wasn't a reputable publication, but he hadn't been able to get his name removed from the website. Then a trusted mentor suggested that I check up on the parent publisher. There it was, on Beall's infamous list. My stomach tightened. I had fallen prey to a predatory journal. I worried that publishing in such a journal could hurt my tenure case and harm my reputation as a scientist.

I asked the journal to withdraw my manuscript from review, figuring that was the logical next step. They demanded that I justify my decision and debated my right to withdraw, insisting that I pay at least $400 to do so. After an exchange of emails—akin to “no way,” “yes way,” and “no way”—and one phone call demanding payment, I informed the journal that we were at an impasse and diverted all correspondence to the trash. I submitted the manuscript to a demonstrably legitimate journal, believing that I had put the mess behind me.

That is, until a few months later, when I noticed an email in my spam folder from the predatory journal congratulating me on my recent publication and requesting payment. I googled the title of my manuscript and found that it had indeed been published. I was horrified: My manuscript had been in review at the legitimate journal for months, and this revelation would jeopardize its publication.

To my relief, the editor of the legitimate journal agreed to continue the review process, provided my article was withdrawn from the predatory journal. I confronted the predatory journal again and received another demand for $400, this time for removing my manuscript from the online publication. This was pure extortion, and I refused. Bewildered about how to move forward, I again reached out to my mentor. His email reply simply read “Not good,” and we got to work on a plan. After a week's worth of back and forth correspondence, including a document on official university letterhead and threats of legal action and wide exposure, we finally persuaded the journal to withdraw the work and dismiss the fees. However, 4 weeks later, the manuscript is still available online.

I fell into this trap because of my ignorance. I now ignore every invitation to publish my research in any journal. And I know to be wary of any offer that comes via email, whether from journals or international conferences. After all, time spent on manuscript hostage negotiations doesn't count toward tenure.

Collagen V (Col V) and collagen III (Col III) are crucial target matrices of ColG and ColH, respectively. We herein investigated the relevance between the expression of target matrices in pancreatic tissues and influence of ColG:ColH ratio on islet isolation outcome.Islet isolation was performed in Lewis and SD rats using different ColG:ColH ratios (5:1, 1:1 and 1:5; n = 7/group). The composition of Col III and Col V was examined using immunohistochemical staining, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Chain types in collagen I (Col I) were also assessed using mass spectrometry.No beneficial effects were observed by increasing the ColG amount, irrespective of the rat strain. In contrast, the islet yield in Lewis rats was considerably increased by high amounts of ColH but decreased in SD rats, suggesting that Lewis pancreas contains more Col III than SD pancreas. Neither immunohistochemical nor real-time PCR showed correlation with isolation outcome. However, Western blotting revealed that Lewis contained considerably higher amount of Col III than SD (p = 0.10). Likewise, Col-I(α1)/Col-III(α1) and Col-I(α2)/Col-III(α1) were significantly lower in Lewis than in SD rats (p = 0.007, respectively). Furthermore, the isolation outcome was considerably correlated with the composition of homotrimeric Col I.The Col III expression and the composition of homotrimeric Col I in pancreatic tissues determined using mass analyses appeared useful for optimizing the ColG:ColH ratio in islet isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2944605526,"RAG2 of the V(D)J recombinase is essential for lymphocyte development. Within the RAG2 noncore region is a plant homeodomain (PHD) that interacts with the modified histone H3K4me3, and this interaction is important for relieving inhibition of the RAG recombinase for V(D)J recombination. However, the effect of the noncore region on RAG2 localization and dynamics in cell nuclei is poorly understood. Here, we used cell imaging to measure the effect of mutating the RAG2 noncore region on properties of the full length protein. We measured GFP-labeled full length RAG2 (FL), the RAG2 core region alone (Core), and a T490A mutant in the noncore region, which has unique regulatory properties. This showed that FL, T490A, and Core localized to nuclear domains that were adjacent to DAPI-rich heterochromatin, and that contained the active chromatin marker H3K4me3. Within the RAG2-enriched regions, T490A exhibited greater colocalization with H3K4me3 than either FL or Core. Furthermore, colocalization of H3K4me3 with FL and T490A, but not Core, increased in conditions that increased H3K4me3 levels. Superresolution imaging showed H3K4me3 was distributed as puncta that RAG2 abutted, and mobility measurements showed that T490A had a significantly lower rate of diffusion within the nucleus than either FL or Core proteins. Finally, mutating Trp453 of the T490A mutant (W453A,T490A), which blocks PHD-dependent interactions with H3K4me3, abolished the T490A-mediated increased colocalization with H3K4me3 and slower mobility compared to FL. Altogether, these data show that Thr490 in the noncore region modulates RAG2 localization and dynamics in the pre-B cell nucleus, such as by affecting RAG2 interactions with H3K4me3."
https://openalex.org/W2783387823,"According to the social heuristics hypothesis, people intuitively cooperate or defect depending on which behavior is beneficial in their interactions. If cooperation is beneficial, people intuitively cooperate, but if defection is beneficial, they intuitively defect. However, deliberation promotes defection. Here, we tested two novel predictions regarding the role of trust in the social heuristics hypothesis. First, whether trust promotes intuitive cooperation. Second, whether preferring to think intuitively or deliberatively moderates the effect of trust on cooperation. In addition, we examined whether deciding intuitively promotes cooperation, compared to deciding deliberatively. To evaluate these predictions, we conducted a lab study in Colombia and an online study in the United Kingdom (N = 1,066; one study was pre-registered). Unexpectedly, higher trust failed to promote intuitive cooperation, though higher trust promoted cooperation. In addition, preferring to think intuitively or deliberatively failed to moderate the effect of trust on cooperation, although preferring to think intuitively increased cooperation. Moreover, deciding intuitively failed to promote cooperation, and equivalence testing confirmed that this null result was explained by the absence of an effect, rather than a lack of statistical power (equivalence bounds: d = -0.26 and 0.26). An intuitive cooperation effect emerged when non-compliant participants were excluded, but this effect could be due to selection biases. Taken together, most results failed to support the social heuristics hypothesis. We conclude by discussing implications, future directions, and limitations. The materials, data, and code are available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/939jv/)."
https://openalex.org/W2944076943,"Acute pancreatitis is a severe systemic disease triggered by a sterile inflammation and initial local tissue damage of the pancreas. Immune cells infiltrating into the pancreas are main mediators of acute pancreatitis pathogenesis. In addition to their antimicrobial potency, macrolides possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which are routinely used in patients with chronic airway infections and might also beneficial in the treatment of acute lung injury. We here tested the hypothesis that the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin can improve the course of acute experimental pancreatitis via ameliorating the damage imposed by sterile inflammation, and could be used as a disease specific therapy. However, our data show that azithromycin does not have influence on caerulein induced acute pancreatitis in terms of reduction of organ damage, and disease severity. Furthermore Infiltration of immune cells into the pancreas or the lungs was not attenuated by azithromycin as compared to controls or ampicillin treated animals with acute experimental pancreatitis. We conclude that in the chosen model, azithromycin does not have any beneficial effects and that its immunomodulatory properties cannot be used to decrease disease severity in the model of caerulein-induced pancreatitis in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2944185191,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of adult acute leukemia with ~20,000 new cases yearly. The disease develops in people of all ages, but is more prominent in the elderly, who due to limited treatment options, have poor overall survival rates. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting specific cell surface molecules have proven to be safe and effective in different haematological malignancies. However, AML target molecules are currently limited so discovery of new targets would be highly beneficial to patients. We examined the C-type lectin receptor CD302 as a potential therapeutic target for AML due to its selective expression in myeloid immune populations. In a cohort of 33 AML patients with varied morphological and karyotypic classifications, 88% were found to express CD302 on the surface of blasts and 80% on the surface of CD34+ CD38- population enriched with leukemic stem cells. A mAb targeting human CD302 was effective in mediating antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity and was internalised, making it amenable to toxin conjugation. Targeting CD302 with antibody limited in vivo engraftment of the leukemic cell line HL-60 in NOD/SCID mice. While CD302 was expressed in a hepatic cell line, HepG2, this molecule was not detected on the surface of HepG2, nor could HepG2 be killed using a CD302 antibody-drug conjugate. Expression was however found on the surface of haematopoietic stem cells suggesting that targeting CD302 would be most effective prior to haematopoietic transplantation. These studies provide the foundation for examining CD302 as a potential therapeutic target for AML."

Methods A total of 253 MSM, 20 years of age and older, were recruited from the community in Southern Taiwan in 2015–2016. At baseline and at each follow-up visit, MSM were screened for HPV to identify 37 HPV genotypes. At the six-month follow-up, MSM were asked to fill out an egocentric network assessment and to report the last five persons with whom they had sex regarding the characteristics of sexual behavior with each network member. Results A total of 182 participants (71.9%) returned for the follow-up and one third had at least one HPV type detected. A higher level of bridging network position calculated by the level of constraints in the network was significantly less likely to have HPV detection at the anal site. A high level of concurrency was associated with penile HPV detection (AOR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.01–9.86). Conclusions Identifying network-related characteristics can advance our understanding of high-risk populations and for prioritizing HPV vaccine recommendations."

However, there is a lack of clarity over adolescent pregnancy from adolescents' perspective, particularly in the low- and middle income countries including Iran. This study aimed to explore the experiences of Iranian married female adolescent in confronting pregnancy. This qualitative research was conducted using conventional content analysis approach. Unstructured interviews with 24 female adolescents (aged 14–18 years) were used for data collection, and data analysis was done simultaneously. In this study, the participants were recruited from urban and rural primary healthcare centers (PHCs). The PHCs were selected randomly from several towns and villages of Guilan Province, Iran. The participants were recruited through a purposive sampling method. After data analysis, four categories were extracted from 24 interviews, including ""actively accepting pregnancy"", ""passively accepting pregnancy"", ""hope and satisfaction"" and ""frustration and regret"". These categories formed the main theme of ""paradox of acceptance"" in confronting pregnancy. The concepts that have emerged based on the results of the study can potentially help develop comprehensive and age-tailored health promotion programs to confront pregnancy more successfully for female pregnant adolescents. Further research, particularly on the long-term effects of teenage motherhood is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2944289159,"The upwelling hypothesis has been proposed to explain reduced or lack of population structure in seabird species specialized in food resources available at cold-water upwellings. However, population genetic structure may be challenging to detect in species with large population sizes, since variation in allele frequencies are more robust under genetic drift. High gene flow among populations, that can be constant or pulses of migration in a short period, may also decrease power of algorithms to detect genetic structure. Penguin species usually have large population sizes, high migratory ability but philopatric behavior, and recent investigations debate the existence of subtle population structure for some species not detected before. Previous study on Humboldt penguins found lack of population genetic structure for colonies of Punta San Juan and from South Chile. Here, we used mtDNA and nuclear markers (10 microsatellites and RAG1 intron) to evaluate population structure for 11 main breeding colonies of Humboldt penguins, covering the whole spatial distribution of this species. Although mtDNA failed to detect population structure, microsatellite loci and nuclear intron detected population structure along its latitudinal distribution. Microsatellite showed significant Rst values between most of pairwise locations (44 of 56 locations, Rst = 0.003 to 0.081) and 86% of individuals were assigned to their sampled colony, suggesting philopatry. STRUCTURE detected three main genetic clusters according to geographical locations: i) Peru; ii) North of Chile; and iii) Central-South of Chile. The Humboldt penguin shows signal population expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), suggesting that the genetic structure of the species is a result of population dynamics and foraging colder water upwelling that favor gene flow and phylopatric rate. Our findings thus highlight that variable markers and wide sampling along the species distribution are crucial to better understand genetic population structure in animals with high dispersal ability."

The molecular rearrangements required for ligand entry are not yet fully clear. To improve our understanding of the binding process we combined molecular dynamics simulations with previously published structural and dynamic NMR parameters. The resulting ensembles reveal two distinct modes of barrel opening with one corresponding to the transition between the apo and holo states, whereas the other affecting different protein regions in both ligation states. Comparison of the calculated structures with NMR-derived parameters reporting on slow conformational exchange processes suggests that the protein undergoes partial unfolding along a path related to the second mode of the identified barrel opening motion."
https://openalex.org/W2943905631,"Ecological communities are structured by multiple processes operating at multiple scales yet understanding the scale-dependency of these processes remains an open challenge. This might be particularly true for parasites, for which biotic rather than abiotic processes may play a primary role in structuring communities. Focusing on vines, a group of structural parasites that gain access to the canopy using different climbing mechanisms, we examined the influence of abiotic factors in tandem with host-parasite and parasite-parasite interactions in the assembly of tropical vine communities. Two synthetic variables, namely Climate1 and landscape Variety, were consistently important in explaining variation in species richness and diversity, as well as species composition, but their importance varied with scale. Whereas Climate1 summarizes the largest variability among climatic variables, landscape Variety expresses landscape heterogeneity within a neighborhood. Significant patterns of species co-occurrences suggest that vine-vine interactions also contribute to vine community assembly. Our results may be critical to understand vine proliferation and help design management strategies for their control."

Early, reliable prediction of mortality may improve patient management.We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 1,599 patients with AP treated at a single large hospital in southwest China. Models to predict mortality were derived from a subset of 1,062 patients (development dataset), and the models were then validated in the remaining 537 patients (validation dataset). Independent risk factors and prediction models for mortality were identified using logistic regression.A total of 33 patients in the development dataset and 13 in the validation dataset died during hospitalization. Independent risk factors for mortality were found to be plasma urea levels, glucose levels and platelet counts at admission; as well as peak urea levels, leukocyte counts and use of invasive ventilation during hospitalization. Based on the development dataset, a mortality prediction model based only on urea level at admission gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81, which did not significantly improve by incorporating glucose level or platelet count at admission. Significantly better was a model taking into account three in-hospital parameters: peak urea level, leukocyte count and use of invasive ventilation (AUC 0.97).While mortality of AP patients can be predicted reasonably well based only on urea values at admission, predictions are more reliable when they take into account in-hospital data on peak urea level, leukocyte count and use of invasive ventilation."
https://openalex.org/W2944278633,"Humans exert a great deal of control over our local environments-selecting and arranging the many objects around us on the basis of conflicting task-demands, aesthetic preferences, and habitual convenience. Because routine behaviour necessitates that we regularly find and access these objects, the particular arrangements we choose can influence the likelihood and difficulty of engaging in different tasks and actions. Despite this importance, relatively little research has directly examined human organizational behaviours and tendencies. Here we investigate how objects in a computer-based search task are freely and dynamically arranged by participants over time, while manipulating the statistics of the target sequence. We report common organizational behaviours including reduction of distance between targets as well as separation of target subsets with high community. However, the extent of these behaviours and their relationship to individual differences in performance varies as a function of the target sequence structure. In particular, tasks composed of a larger number of smaller groups of targets lead to better organizational and performance outcomes than tasks composed of fewer larger groups."
https://openalex.org/W2944373556,"Digital public displays installed in various locations provide valuable information for the passers-by. However, the static characteristic of the digital public display limits the consumption of the displayed content to a small area. Personal mobile devices such as smartphones are now capable of interacting with digital public displays, which enables the passers-by to ""take-away"" the content and consume it on-the-go. This process requires device binding, content selection, and transfer between the two devices. In this paper, we propose a device binding method which utilizes the content brightness changing pattern as a unique content ID on the public display and an illuminance sensor on the mobile to bind and transfer between two devices. We conducted performance evaluations for binding algorithm robustness in different conditions. Also comparative studies among other binding interaction methods were conducted. Our results show that our proposed method performed stably across the various conditions and overall performance in interaction completion time and error rate was similar or superior to the existing methods."
