https://openalex.org/W2128056082,"Eukaryotic replication origins are 'licensed' for replication early in the cell cycle by loading Mcm(2–7) proteins. As chromatin replicates, Mcm(2–7) are removed, thus preventing the origin from firing again. Here we report the purification of the RLF-B component of the licensing system and show that it corresponds to Cdt1. RLF-B/Cdt1 was inhibited by geminin, a protein that is degraded during late mitosis. Immunodepletion of geminin from metaphase extracts allowed them to assemble licensed replication origins. Inhibition of CDKs in metaphase stimulated origin assembly only after the depletion of geminin. These experiments suggest that geminin-mediated inhibition of RLF-B/Cdt1 is essential for repressing origin assembly late in the cell cycle of higher eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2000834350,"Similar to most if not all pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, Bid (and its truncated product t-Bid) triggers cell death via mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP). This effect can be monitored in intact cells, upon microinjection of recombinant Bid protein into the cytoplasm, as well as in purified mitochondria, upon addition of Bid protein. Here we show that Bid-induced MMP can be inhibited, both in cells and in the cell-free system, by three pharmacological inhibitors of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), namely cyclosporin A, N-methyl-4-Val-cyclosporin A, and bongkrekic acid (a ligand of the adenine nucleotide translocase, ANT, one of the PTPC components). Bid effects on synthetic membranes were studied either in proteoliposomes or in synthetic bilayers subjected to electrophysiological measurements. Full length Bid preferentially permeabilizes membranes and induces the formation of large conductance channels at neutral pH, when added to liposomes or bilayers containing both purified ANT and Bax, yet has no or little effect combined with ANT or Bax alone. t-Bid acts on membranes containing ANT alone with the same efficiency as on those containing both ANT and Bax. These results suggest that the proapoptotic effects of Bid are mediated, at least in part, by its functional interaction with ANT, one of the major components of PTPC."

https://openalex.org/W1940308554,"The pathophysiologic pathways and clinical expression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are not well understood. This is mainly the result of the heteroplasmic nature of most pathogenic mtDNA mutations and of the absence of clinically relevant animal models with mtDNA mutations. mtDNA mutations predisposing to hearing impairment in humans are generally homoplasmic, yet some individuals with these mutations have severe hearing loss, whereas their maternal relatives with the identical mtDNA mutation have normal hearing1,2. Epidemiologic, biochemical and genetic data indicate that nuclear genes are often the main determinants of these differences in phenotype3,4,5. To identify a mouse model for maternally inherited hearing loss, we screened reciprocal backcrosses of three inbred mouse strains, A/J, NOD/LtJ and SKH2/J, with age-related hearing loss (AHL). In the (A/J×CAST/Ei)×A/J backcross, mtDNA derived from the A/J strain exerted a significant detrimental effect on hearing when compared with mtDNA from the CAST/Ei strain. This effect was not seen in the (NOD/LtJ ×CAST/Ei)×NOD/LtJ and (SKH2/J×CAST/Ei)×SKH2/J backcrosses. Genotyping revealed that this effect was seen only in mice homozygous for the A/J allele at the Ahl locus on mouse chromosome 10. Sequencing of the mitochondrial genome in the three inbred strains revealed a single nucleotide insertion in the tRNA-Arg gene (mt-Tr) as the probable mediator of the mitochondrial effect. This is the first mouse model with a naturally occurring mtDNA mutation affecting a clinical phenotype, and it provides an experimental model to dissect the pathophysiologic processes connecting mtDNA mutations to hearing loss."

https://openalex.org/W1513463586,"Resistance of primary cells to transformation by oncogenic Ras has been attributed to the induction of replicative growth arrest. This irreversible 'fail-safe mechanism' resembles senescence and requires induction by Ras of p19ARF and p53 (refs 3-5). Mutation of either p19ARF or p53 alleviates Ras-induced senescence and facilitates oncogenic transformation by Ras. Here we report that, whereas Rb and p107 are each dispensable for Ras-induced replicative arrest, simultaneous ablation of both genes disrupts Ras-induced senescence and results in unrestrained proliferation. This occurs despite activation by Ras of the p19ARF /p53 pathway, identifying pRb and p107 as essential mediators of Ras-induced antiproliferative p19ARF/p53 signalling. Unexpectedly, in contrast to p19ARF or p53 deficiency, loss of Rb/p107 function does not result in oncogenic transformation by Ras, as Ras-expressing Rb-/-/p107-/- fibroblasts fail to grow anchorage-independently in vitro and are not tumorigenic in vivo. These results demonstrate that in the absence of both Rb and p107 cells are resistant to p19ARF/p53-dependent protection against Ras-induced proliferation, and uncouple escape from Ras-induced premature senescence from oncogenic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2092215775,"Evaluating the chromatinized erbB2 gene in nuclei from breast cancer cells expressing varying levels of ErbB2 transcripts, we identified a nuclease-sensitive site within a 0.22 kb region of maximum enhancer activity centered over a conserved 28 bp polypurine(GGA)-polypyrimidine(TCC) mirror-repeat and an adjacent essential Ets binding site (EBS). Promoter footprinting with nuclear extracts reveals an intense Ets hypersensitivity site at the EBS whose degree of intensity correlates with the level of cellular ErbB2 expression. In vitro mapping assays show that the supercoiled erbB2 promoter forms an internal triplex structure (Hr-DNA) at the mirror-repeat element. Mutations preventing Hr-DNA formation can enhance erbB2 promoter activity in human breast cancer cells, a result consistent with previous demonstration that Ets-erbB2 promoter complexes cannot form when the mirror-repeat is engaged in triplex binding, and new results suggesting that Ets binding induces severe promoter bending that may restrict local triplex formation. In addition to previously described erbB2-regulating breast cancer Ets factors (PEA3, ESX/Elf-3), Elf-1 is now shown to be another endogenously expressed Ets candidate capable of binding to and upregulating the erbB2 promoter. Given current strategies to transcriptionally inhibit ErbB2 overexpression, including development of novel erbB2 promoter-targeted therapeutics, an EBS-targeted approach is presented using chimeric Ets proteins that strongly repress erbB2 promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1992981111,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an efficient inhibitor of cell proliferation. Here we show that part of the antiproliferative activity of NO in fibroblasts is mediated through p53 signaling pathway. Cells from p53−/− knockout mice are compromised in their ability to stop dividing in the presence of NO. NO strongly induces expression of genes which are transcriptional targets of p53, and p53 is necessary for some, but not all, of the transcription activation effects of NO. Furthermore, NO strongly increases the cellular level of p53 protein. Since phosphorylation of particular residues of the p53 molecule has been correlated with its functional activity, we determined the phosphorylation pattern of p53 molecule after exposure to NO and compared it with the phosphorylation patterns that develop upon treatment with gamma-irradiation, UV light, and adriamycin. We found that NO induces a specific signature pattern of p53 phosphorylation, distinct from the patterns evoked by other inducers. This study suggests that NO activates specific signaling pathways that may partially overlap, but that do not coincide, with signaling pathways activated by other known inducers of p53 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2168510057,"The tumour suppressor IRF-1 is a transcription factor involved in the induction of apoptosis in several in vitro systems. Post-lactational involution of the mammary gland is characterized by extensive apoptosis of the epithelial cells. We have previously shown that signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 drives apoptosis and involution in the mouse mammary gland. Since one of the downstream targets of the Stat signalling pathway is IRF-1, we have used IRF-1 knockout mice to address the potential role of this transcription factor in involution. Surprisingly, in the absence of IRF-1 significantly higher numbers of apoptotic cells were found in involuting glands at 48 h compared to control glands. In addition, the alveolar structure in IRF-1 null mammary glands had collapsed whereas in control glands the alveoli remained intact and distended. However, by 72 h control and null glands were morphologically similar suggesting that IRF-1 suppresses apoptosis only during the early, reversible, stage of involution. This suggests a survival role for IRF-1 in mammary epithelia and demonstrates a novel role for IRF-1 in vivo – suppression of premature epithelial apoptosis during mammary gland involution."
https://openalex.org/W2325632885,"The expression of the linked but reciprocally imprinted Igf2 and H19 genes is activated in adult liver in the course of tumor development. By in situ hybridization analysis we have shown that both the Igf2 and H19 RNAs are expressed in the majority of the neoplastic nodules, and that hepatocellular carcinomas are developed in an experimental model of liver carcinogenesis. H19 is also highly activated in smaller and less distinct hyperplastic regions. The few neoplastic areas showing Igf2 but no H19 RNA display loss of the maternally inherited allele at the Igf2/H19 locus. These data are compatible with the existence of a common activation mechanism of these two genes during liver carcinogenesis and with a stronger H19 induction in the pre-neoplastic lesions. By using mice carrying a deletion of the H19 endodermal enhancer, we show that this regulatory element is necessary for the activation of the Igf2 and H19 genes upon induction of liver carcinogenesis. Furthermore, multiple sites of the H19 endodermal enhancer region become hypersensitive to DNase I when the carcinogenesis process is induced. Lastly, liver tumors developed in mice paternally inheriting the H19 enhancer deletion are found to have marked growth delays, increased frequency of apoptotic nuclei, and lack of Igf2 mRNA expression, thus indicating that this regulatory element plays a major role in the progression of liver carcinogenesis, since it is required for the activation of the anti-apoptotic Igf2 gene."
