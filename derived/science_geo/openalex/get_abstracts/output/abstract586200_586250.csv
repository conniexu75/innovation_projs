Paired single-cell analyses thus offer valuable knowledge of tumor-driven immune changes, providing a powerful tool for the rational design of immune therapies. Current checkpoint blockade therapies mainly function to rescue T cells from exhaustion or deplete T regulatory cells (Treg). Studies have begun to dissect the details of T cell function and distribution in advanced tumor lesions to identify novel strategies to further strengthen anti-tumor T cell immunity. Myeloid cells, through their ability to present tumor-associated antigens to T cells and to produce critical T cell differentiation cytokines, have a unique ability to control T cell function at the tumor site. Yet, much less is known about the diversity of the myeloid compartment at the tumor site. Myeloid cells are a diverse population of immune cells that share the ability to sense and respond to tissue injuries by clearing damaged cells and by promoting the recruitment of immune effector cells that will help restore tissue integrity (Lavin and Merad, 2013Lavin Y.

Neutrophil serine proteases: specific regulators of inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIM) consist of granulocytes and mononuclear phagocytes at varying stages of differentiation and have been shown to contribute to shaping tumor progression and response to treatment (Engblom et al., 2016Engblom C.

Of these, mononuclear phagocytes refer to monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC), which, in addition to their innate immune function, share the ability to present tumor-associated antigens to T cells (Ginhoux and Jung, 2014Ginhoux F. Jung S. Monocytes and macrophages: developmental pathways and tissue homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 392-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Among TIM, DC are the best equipped to drive T cell activation (Merad et al., 2013Merad M. Sathe P. Helft J. Miller J. Mortha A. The dendritic cell lineage: ontogeny and function of dendritic cells and their subsets in the steady state and the inflamed setting.Annu. Rev.

Thus, TIM composition appears to control tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) composition, activation, and anti-tumor function, and harnessing the TIM compartment may provide a powerful synergistic strategy to potentiate T cell targeting immunotherapies. Currently, the majority of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stage. However, this is likely to change, as low-dose CT screening programs in populations at risk have shown benefits and are being widely implemented (Aberle et al., 2011Aberle D.R. Adams A.M. Berg C.D.

Five-year survival rates for patients with pathologic stage IA and IB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are only 83% and 71%, respectively, and these numbers drop to 50% for stage II disease (Goldstraw et al., 2016Goldstraw P.

Oncol. 2008; 26: 3552-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Preliminary data suggest impressive activity of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in a small number of early stage resectable lung NSCLC lesions treated with anti-PD-1 mAb blockade (Forde et al., 2016Forde P.M. Smith K.N. Chaft J.E. Hellmann M. Merghoub T. Wolchok J.D. Yang S.C. Battafarano R.J. Gabrielson E. Georgiades C.S. et al.Neoadjuvant anti-PD1, nivolumab, in early stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancer.ESMO 2016 Congress. 2016; 27: 1-36Google Scholar). Although these studies need to be confirmed in a larger cohort, these results are consistent with the notion that immunotherapy agents are most efficient at low tumor burden and in patients naïve of immunomodulatory chemotherapy agents. The design of immunomodulatory strategies for the treatment of NSCLC will, however, tremendously benefit from a detailed understanding of the immune cell landscape that develops specifically in response to tumor cues. To this end, we developed a multiscale immune profiling strategy to map the immune microenvironment of early lung adenocarcinoma lesions. As tissue cues significantly impact the biology of tissue-resident immune cells and specifically innate cells (Lavin et al., 2014Lavin Y. Winter D. Blecher-Gonen R. David E. Keren-Shaul H. Merad M. Jung S. Amit I. Tissue-resident macrophage enhancer landscapes are shaped by the local microenvironment.Cell. 2014; 159: 1312-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), we designed a barcoding strategy that allowed the simultaneous single-cell analysis of the distinct immune cell compartments that reside in the tumor site, non-involved lung tissue (nLung), and blood of each patient to distinguish tumor-driven immune signatures from those caused by normal tissue-imprinting cues. Using mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) combined with single-cell transcriptomics and multiplex tissue imaging of the lung tumor, we identify NK and myeloid cell responses that are unique to tumor lesions and absent from nLung or blood from the same patients. We show that these changes are present as early as in stage I tumors and likely compromise anti-tumor immunity. These data suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy strategies targeting innate immune cells in early lung adenocarcinoma lesions have the potential to reactivate the TIL microenvironment and transform tumor response to checkpoint blockade. To map the immune microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma lesions, we designed a clinical multiscale immune profiling study of freshly resected tumors. Patients selected were treatment naïve at the time of surgery. For each patient, we obtained NSCLC tumor tissues including invasive margins, nLung tissue, and blood cells (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). Of 32 patients, 28 were diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. Patients were representative of the lung adenocarcinoma distribution across age, gender, mutational status, and predominant histological subtype (Table S1). To distinguish tumor-specific immune changes from the lung tissue immune environment, we sought to simultaneously map the immune compartment of the lung tumor lesion, the nLung tissue, and the peripheral blood. To this end, we developed a novel barcoding method that allows a simultaneous analysis of cells from all three sample types. In the first 18-patient cohort, immune cells isolated from the tumor lesion, nLung, and blood were barcoded with anti-CD45 antibodies (Ab) conjugated to unique metal isotopes before samples were pooled. Pooled samples were then stained with two panels of more than 30 antibodies each and analyzed by CyTOF, thus allowing the measurement of single-cell expression on immune cells residing in each tissue type of each patient (Figure 1A). The mass cytometry panels were subsequently extended to include cytokine measurement in a cohort of ten additional lung adenocarcinoma patients, as described in the STAR Methods. Using viSNE to visualize high-dimensional data in two dimensions while preserving single-cell resolution (Amir et al., 2013Amir A.D. Davis K.L. Tadmor M.D. Simonds E.F. Levine J.H. Bendall S.C. Shenfeld D.K. Krishnaswamy S. Nolan G.P. Pe’er D. viSNE enables visualization of high dimensional single-cell data and reveals phenotypic heterogeneity of leukemia.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), we analyzed the distribution of the different immune cell lineages that accumulated in lung tumor lesions, nLung, and blood circulation across patients (Table S1 and Data S1). A higher number of immune cells accumulated in the tumor tissues compared to nLung (Figure S1A). The tumor-resident immune cell compartment comprised all major immune lineages, and the most abundant were the T lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes (Figures 1B–1D, and S1B). Mononuclear phagocytes and granulocytes were equally represented in tumor lesions compared to nLung. In contrast, T and B lymphocytes were present at a higher frequency in the tumor microenvironment compared to the nLung, whereas the frequency of NK cells was significantly reduced across all lung adenocarcinoma patients examined (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1C). We also analyzed the cytokines and chemokines produced in the tumor milieu. Whereas many chemokines and cytokines were expressed at much higher levels in the tumors compared to the blood, similar chemokine levels were often detected in tumors and adjacent nLung, which could potentially reflect the local diffusion of tumor-produced soluble molecules to the adjacent lung tissue (Figures S1D and S1E). Interestingly, CX3CL1 (fractalkine) was expressed at slightly higher levels in tumors compared to nLung and correlated with the frequency of the mononuclear phagocyte infiltrate (Figure S1F). Recent studies have shown that, in addition to cell composition, the spatial distribution of immune cells at the tumor site may affect tumor outcome (Germain et al., 2014Germain C. Gnjatic S. Tamzalit F. Knockaert S. Remark R. Goc J. Lepelley A. Becht E. Katsahian S. Bizouard G. et al.Presence of B cells in tertiary lymphoid structures is associated with a protective immunity in patients with lung cancer.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2014; 189: 832-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Using a new tissue-profiling method named “multiplexed immunohistochemical consecutive staining on a single slide” (MICSSS) that we recently developed in the laboratory (Remark et al., 2016Remark R. Merghoub T. Grabe N. Litjens G. Damotte D. Wolchok J.D. Merad M. Gnjatic S. In-depth tissue profiling using multiplexed immunohistochemical consecutive staining on single slide.Science Immunology. 2016; 1: aaf6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we assessed the distribution of immune cells in the tumor and nLung sections. Immune cells accumulated mainly in the stroma and invasive margin surrounding the tumor islets as previously described (Salmon et al., 2012Salmon H. Franciszkiewicz K. Damotte D. Dieu-Nosjean M.C. Validire P. Trautmann A. Mami-Chouaib F. Donnadieu E. Matrix architecture defines the preferential localization and migration of T cells into the stroma of human lung tumors.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, Turley et al., 2015Turley S.J. Cremasco V. Astarita J.L. Immunological hallmarks of stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), although some macrophages and T cells were able to infiltrate into the tumors (Figures 1E and S1I). We also observed an abundance of mononuclear phagocytes and T cells at the tumor site across patients supporting the CyTOF results (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1B). Importantly, many patients had tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which accumulated near the tumor invasive margin and were absent from nLung (Figures 1F and S1I). Tumor lesions enriched in TLS had significantly more T lymphocytes and fewer mononuclear phagocytes as measured by CyTOF at the tumor site (Figure S1H). To further probe the nature of the immune response induced at the tumor site in an unbiased manner, we analyzed the CyTOF data using the Phenograph algorithm to systematically identify common cellular communities across the three tissues and across all patients (Levine et al., 2015Levine J.H. Simonds E.F. Bendall S.C. Davis K.L. Amir A.D. Tadmor M.D. Litvin O. Fienberg H.G. Jager A. Zunder E.R. et al.Data-driven phenotypic dissection of AML reveals progenitor-like cells that correlate with prognosis.Cell. 2015; 162: 184-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). We first clustered single cells based on shared protein expression across tumor lesions, nLung, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) within each patient then merged clusters from each patient using a secondary clustering analysis to identify metaclusters common across patients and tissues (Figure 1A). Phenograph clustering across tissues and across all patients revealed distinct T lymphoid metaclusters (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A) that corresponded to known immune cell populations and had a unique distribution across tissue sites (Figures 2C and S2B).Figure S2Tregs Upregulate Immunosuppressive Molecules at the Tumor Site, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) viSNE plots of CD3+ single cells across tissues showing normalized expression of 30 indicated markers of a representative patient.(B) Bar plots showing frequencies across tissues for remaining metaclusters from Figure 2B (n=18).(C) Ratio of CD8+ GranzymeB+ T cells to Tregs metacluster frequencies across tissue (n=18).(D) Normalized expression of ICOS, 41BB, and CD38 on tumor CD3+ cells shown on viSNE plots for a representative patient (left) and bar pots showing normalized expression across patients for indicated metaclusters in tumor (n=18) (right).(E) Heatmap of CD8- T cell bulk sequencing normalized UMI counts grouped by tissues across 6 patients (left).

Bar plots show mean ± SEM; ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01 and ∗∗∗p<0.001 by paired t-test. Paired mass cytometry analysis revealed a distinct composition and phenotype of T cell subsets (Figures 2C and S2B). Specifically, Treg were significantly increased in the tumor lesion across all patients even at early stages (Figure 2C). Importantly, Treg at the tumor sites expressed high levels of CTLA4, CD39, ICOS, and 41BB compared to other T cells (Figures 2D and S2D). They were also clearly distinguishable from Treg that resided in nLung based on higher expression of Foxp3, CTLA4, PD-1, CD39, ICOS, CD38, and 41BB, whereas CCR4 was decreased (Figures 2E, S2E, and S2F). In contrast, cytolytic CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced in frequency in the tumor compared to nLung and blood from the same patients (Figure 2C). Moreover, total CD8+ T cells present in tumors expressed significantly less granzyme B and IFNγ upon stimulation compared to their nLung counterparts (Figure S2G). A reduced T-effector/Treg ratio was thus a strong signature of the lung tumor lesion (Figure S2C). Given the success of anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade in lung cancer patients, we examined the expression of the checkpoint molecule PD-1 on all T cell metaclusters identified across tissues. PD-1 was distinctly expressed on a small subset of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were a unique feature of the tumor (Figures 2C and S2H) and at a lower level on Treg at the tumor site (Figure 2D). CD8+ T cells accumulate at the tumor site and in TLS, where they preferentially expand (Figures 2F and S2I; Goc et al., 2014Goc J. Germain C. Vo-Bourgais T.K. Lupo A. Klein C.

Germain C. Liu Z. Sebastian Y. Devi P. Knockaert S. Brohawn P. Lehmann K. Damotte D. Validire P. et al.A high density of tertiary lymphoid structure B cells in lung tumors is associated with increased CD4(+) T cell receptor repertoire clonality.OncoImmunology. 2015; 4: e1051922Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, T cells were significantly increased in TLS-enriched tumors (Figure S1H). Moreover, while there was no enrichment in TCR clonality in tumors compared to nLung, the CD8+PD-1+ T cell subset uniquely and significantly correlated with increased TCR clonality at the tumor site but not in nLung (Figures 2G and S2J). These results suggest that CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 are clonally expanded at the tumor site and that this expansion may preferentially occur in TLS-enriched tumor lesions. In addition to measuring adaptive lymphocyte responses to tumors, we also analyzed the distribution of innate lymphocytes and in particular NK cells in lung tumor lesions. Strikingly, NK cells were the least abundant immune cell lineage in lung adenocarcinoma lesions compared to nLung (Figures 1C and 1D). Importantly, the NK cell subset expressing CD16 was most dramatically reduced in the tumor compared to nLung (Figures 3A and S3A). NK cells that infiltrated the tumor lesion expressed higher CXCR3 levels, a molecule shown to be required for NK infiltration of tumors (Figures 3B and 3C; Wendel et al., 2008Wendel M. Galani I.E. Suri-Payer E. Cerwenka A. Natural killer cell accumulation in tumors is dependent on IFN-gamma and CXCR3 ligands.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8437-8445Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Moreover, NK cells that remained at the tumor site were less cytolytic, as they expressed lower levels of granzyme B and CD57 as well as less IFNγ (Figures 3C–3E and S3C). Conversely, since NK cells function to eliminate MHC class-I-deficient cells, we assessed the distribution of MHC class I throughout the tumor cells using MICSSS (Figure 3F). Tumor lesions with reduced frequency of MHC class-I-expressing tumor cells had higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD16+ NK cells, suggesting that the presence of cytolytic NK cells may have led to MHC class I immuno-editing (Figures 3G and S3D).Figure S3NK Cells Correlate with CD16+ Monocytes and Tumor MHC I Expression, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Bar plots of frequency of CD16+ and CD16- NK cell metaclusters stratified by tissue for 10 additional lung adenocarcinoma patients (∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01 and ∗∗∗p<0.001 by paired t-test).(B) Correlation plot showing the relationship of CD16+ monocyte frequency with CD16+ NK cell frequency (Spearman’s rank-based correlation).(C) Bar plots of the normalized expression of granzyme B by CD16+ NK cells across nLung and tumor, upon stimulation (n=9; ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01 and ∗∗∗p<0.001 by paired t-test).(D) Correlation plot illustrating an indirect relationship of HLA-ABC expression on CD45- CD326+ cells and CD16+ NK cell frequency (n=10; Spearman’s rank-based correlation).Bar plots show mean ± SEM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Bar plots of frequency of CD16+ and CD16- NK cell metaclusters stratified by tissue for 10 additional lung adenocarcinoma patients (∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01 and ∗∗∗p<0.001 by paired t-test).

To fully capture the heterogeneity of the TIM compartment, we first performed an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis of non-lymphocyte cells that accumulated in the tumor lesion and in the nLung of a stage I patient using massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (MARS-seq; Figure 4A; Data S2B; STAR Methods; Jaitin et al., 2014Jaitin D.A.

Specifically, we identified three distinct clusters expressing high levels of MHC class II molecules, CD1C, CCL22, and CD207 (Figure 4A, clusters 2–4) and slightly higher BATF3 and CSF2RA expression levels (Figures 4E and S4A), which we inferred to be DC. Other clusters were identified as macrophages (Figure 4A, clusters 5–8) and monocytes (clusters 9–10) based on the differential expression of CD68, MAFB, and CSF1R (Figures 4E and S4A). A macrophage cluster comprised predominantly of cells from tumor lesions (cluster 7) was distinct from those comprised predominantly of cells from nLung (clusters 5–6), indicating that tumor-associated macrophages were distinct from their nLung-resident macrophage counterparts.Figure S4Differential Transcript and Protein Ma"

https://openalex.org/W2610160407,"The spatial organization of chromosomes influences many nuclear processes including gene expression. The cohesin complex shapes the 3D genome by looping together CTCF sites along chromosomes. We show here that chromatin loop size can be increased and that the duration with which cohesin embraces DNA determines the degree to which loops are enlarged. Cohesin’s DNA release factor WAPL restricts this loop extension and also prevents looping between incorrectly oriented CTCF sites. We reveal that the SCC2/SCC4 complex promotes the extension of chromatin loops and the formation of topologically associated domains (TADs). Our data support the model that cohesin structures chromosomes through the processive enlargement of loops and that TADs reflect polyclonal collections of loops in the making. Finally, we find that whereas cohesin promotes chromosomal looping, it rather limits nuclear compartmentalization. We conclude that the balanced activity of SCC2/SCC4 and WAPL enables cohesin to correctly structure chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2610442760,"Antibodies to Zika virus (ZIKV) can be protective. To examine the antibody response in individuals who develop high titers of anti-ZIKV antibodies, we screened cohorts in Brazil and Mexico for ZIKV envelope domain III (ZEDIII) binding and neutralization. We find that serologic reactivity to dengue 1 virus (DENV1) EDIII before ZIKV exposure is associated with increased ZIKV neutralizing titers after exposure. Antibody cloning shows that donors with high ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers have expanded clones of memory B cells that express the same immunoglobulin VH3-23/VK1-5 genes. These recurring antibodies cross-react with DENV1, but not other flaviviruses, neutralize both DENV1 and ZIKV, and protect mice against ZIKV challenge. Structural analyses reveal the mechanism of recognition of the ZEDIII lateral ridge by VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies. Serologic testing shows that antibodies to this region correlate with serum neutralizing activity to ZIKV. Thus, high neutralizing responses to ZIKV are associated with pre-existing reactivity to DENV1 in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2610240952,"The Cdc48 ATPase and its cofactors Ufd1/Npl4 (UN) extract polyubiquitinated proteins from membranes or macromolecular complexes, but how they perform these functions is unclear. Cdc48 consists of an N-terminal domain that binds UN and two stacked hexameric ATPase rings (D1 and D2) surrounding a central pore. Here, we use purified components to elucidate how the Cdc48 complex processes substrates. After interaction of the polyubiquitin chain with UN, ATP hydrolysis by the D2 ring moves the polypeptide completely through the double ring, generating a pulling force on the substrate and causing its unfolding. ATP hydrolysis by the D1 ring is important for subsequent substrate release from the Cdc48 complex. This release requires cooperation of Cdc48 with a deubiquitinase, which trims polyubiquitin to an oligoubiquitin chain that is then also translocated through the pore. Together, these results lead to a new paradigm for the function of Cdc48 and its mammalian ortholog p97/VCP."
https://openalex.org/W2610181528,"Dysregulated rRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation. Here, we report a box H/ACA small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)-ended long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that enhances pre-rRNA transcription (SLERT). SLERT requires box H/ACA snoRNAs at both ends for its biogenesis and translocation to the nucleolus. Deletion of SLERT impairs pre-rRNA transcription and rRNA production, leading to decreased tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, SLERT interacts with DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 via a 143-nt non-snoRNA sequence. Super-resolution images reveal that DDX21 forms ring-shaped structures surrounding multiple Pol I complexes and suppresses pre-rRNA transcription. Binding by SLERT allosterically alters individual DDX21 molecules, loosens the DDX21 ring, and evicts DDX21 suppression on Pol I transcription. Together, our results reveal an important control of ribosome biogenesis by SLERT lncRNA and its regulatory role in DDX21 ring-shaped arrangements acting on Pol I complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2611382824,"The liver plays a pivotal role in metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification, processes that must be particularly efficient when animals are active and feed. A major question is how the liver adapts to these diurnal changes in physiology. Here, we show that, in mice, liver mass, hepatocyte size, and protein levels follow a daily rhythm, whose amplitude depends on both feeding-fasting and light-dark cycles. Correlative evidence suggests that the daily oscillation in global protein accumulation depends on a similar fluctuation in ribosome number. Whereas rRNA genes are transcribed at similar rates throughout the day, some newly synthesized rRNAs are polyadenylated and degraded in the nucleus in a robustly diurnal fashion with a phase opposite to that of ribosomal protein synthesis. Based on studies with cultured fibroblasts, we propose that rRNAs not packaged into complete ribosomal subunits are polyadenylated by the poly(A) polymerase PAPD5 and degraded by the nuclear exosome."
https://openalex.org/W2611805755,"The folding of the mammalian cerebral cortex into sulci and gyri is thought to be favored by the amplification of basal progenitor cells and their tangential migration. Here, we provide a molecular mechanism for the role of migration in this process by showing that changes in intercellular adhesion of migrating cortical neurons result in cortical folding. Mice with deletions of FLRT1 and FLRT3 adhesion molecules develop macroscopic sulci with preserved layered organization and radial glial morphology. Cortex folding in these mutants does not require progenitor cell amplification but is dependent on changes in neuron migration. Analyses and simulations suggest that sulcus formation in the absence of FLRT1/3 results from reduced intercellular adhesion, increased neuron migration, and clustering in the cortical plate. Notably, FLRT1/3 expression is low in the human cortex and in future sulcus areas of ferrets, suggesting that intercellular adhesion is a key regulator of cortical folding across species."
https://openalex.org/W2610605720,"Many studies on the microbiome of animals have been reported but a comprehensive analysis is lacking. Here we present a meta-analysis on the microbiomes of arthropods and their terrestrial habitat, focusing on the functional profile of bacterial communities derived from metabolic traits that are essential for microbial life. We report a detailed analysis of probably the largest set of biochemically defined functional traits ever examined in microbiome studies. This work deals with the phylum proteobacteria, which is usually dominant in marine and terrestrial environments and covers all functions associated with microbiomes. The considerable variation in the distribution and abundance of proteobacteria in microbiomes has remained fundamentally unexplained. This analysis reveals discrete functional groups characteristic for adaptation to anaerobic conditions, which appear to be defined by environmental filtering of taxonomically related taxa. The biochemical diversification of the functional groups suggests an evolutionary trajectory in the structure of arthropods' microbiome, from metabolically versatile to specialized proteobacterial organisms that are adapted to complex environments such as the gut of social insects. Bacterial distribution in arthropods' microbiomes also shows taxonomic clusters that do not correspond to functional groups and may derive from other factors, including common contaminants of soil and reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2610512172,"DNA extraction from clinical samples is commonly achieved with a silica solid phase extraction column in the presence of a chaotrope. Versions of these protocols have been adapted for point of care (POC) diagnostic devices in miniaturized platforms, but commercial kits require a high amount of input DNA. Thus, when the input clinical sample contains less than 1 μg of total DNA, the target-specific DNA recovery from most of these protocols is low without supplementing the sample with exogenous carrier DNA. In fact, many clinical samples used in the development of POC diagnostics often exhibit target DNA concentrations as low as 3 ng/mL. With the broader goal of improving the yield and efficiency of nucleic acid-based POC devices for dilute samples, we investigated both DNA adsorption and recovery from silica particles by using 1 pg- 1 μg of DNA with a set of adsorption and elution buffers ranging in pH and chaotropic presence. In terms of adsorption, we found that low pH and the presence of chaotropic guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) enhanced DNA-silica adsorption. When eluting with a standard low-salt, high-pH buffer, > 70% of DNA was unrecoverable, except when DNA was initially adsorbed with 5 M GuSCN at pH 5.2. Unrecovered DNA was either not initially adsorbed or irreversibly bound on the silica surface. Recovery was improved when eluting with 95°C formamide and 1 M NaOH, which suggested that DNA-silica-chaotrope interactions are dominated by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. While heated formamide and NaOH are non-ideal elution buffers for practical POC devices, the salient results are important for engineering a set of optimized reagents that could maximize nucleic acid recovery from a microfluidic DNA-silica-chaotrope system."

An elaborate quality control system maintains the balance of coding and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) expression in the cell (Tollervey, 2015Tollervey D. RNA surveillance and the exosome.RNA. 2015; 21: 492-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The RNA exosome plays a key role in regulating essential cellular functions by catabolizing many RNA species in different subcellular compartments via its nucleolytic activity (Lykke-Andersen et al., 2009Lykke-Andersen S.

RNA exosome co-factors dictate substrate selection (Thoms et al., 2015Thoms M. Thomson E. Baßler J. Gnädig M. Griesel S. Hurt E. The exosome is recruited to RNA substrates through specific adaptor proteins.Cell. 2015; 162: 1029-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), a feature that is likely regulated via multiple mechanisms that depend on cellular identity and environmental cues. In the nucleus, the RNA exosome exerts a quality control mechanism on some mRNAs and many ncRNAs by degrading aberrant RNA with unprotected 3′ end termini (Andersen et al., 2013Andersen P.R. Domanski M. Kristiansen M.S. Storvall H. Ntini E. Verheggen C. Schein A. Bunkenborg J. Poser I.

This regulatory mechanism is imparted by the cap-binding proteins (CBC20 and CBC80), which coordinate the recruitment of ARS2 and the NEXT-exosome complex to target genes (Hallais et al., 2013Hallais M. Pontvianne F. Andersen P.R. Clerici M. Lener D. Benbahouche Nel.H. Gostan T. Vandermoere F. Robert M.C.

Biol. 2013; 20: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The interaction between these complexes is dictated by the deposition of RBM7 on nascent transcripts (Lubas et al., 2015Lubas M. Andersen P.R. Schein A. Dziembowski A. Kudla G. Jensen T.H. The human nuclear exosome targeting complex is loaded onto newly synthesized RNA to direct early ribonucleolysis.Cell Rep. 2015; 10: 178-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and by spatial proximities around targeted loci. This results in the exosome functioning as a molecular ruler that drives cap-dependent 3′ end maturation mainly at short regulatory RNAs (Hallais et al., 2013Hallais M. Pontvianne F. Andersen P.R. Clerici M. Lener D. Benbahouche Nel.H. Gostan T. Vandermoere F. Robert M.C. Cusack S. et al.CBC-ARS2 stimulates 3′-end maturation of multiple RNA families and favors cap-proximal processing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This quality control system occurs co-transcriptionally and provides immediate clearance of many regulatory RNAs (i.e., enhancer RNAs [eRNAs] and promoter upstream transcripts [PROMPTS]). These targets are mainly detectable in exosome loss-of-functions settings, which allow for monitoring of such an otherwise “hidden” transcriptome (Hilleren et al., 2001Hilleren P. McCarthy T.

RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is usually not an essential co-factor for RNA virus transcription; however, in the case of influenza A virus (IAV), its activity is essential for viral transcription (Amorim et al., 2007Amorim M.J.

Nuclear export of influenza A virus mRNAs requires ongoing RNA polymerase II activity.Traffic. 2007; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Ortín and Martín-Benito, 2015Ortín J. Martín-Benito J. The RNA synthesis machinery of negative-stranded RNA viruses.Virology. 2015; 479-480: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). IAV transcribes its genome in the nucleus of infected cells (Herz et al., 1981Herz C. Stavnezer E. Krug R. Gurney Jr., T. Influenza virus, an RNA virus, synthesizes its messenger RNA in the nucleus of infected cells.Cell. 1981; 26: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)—a unique feature for some RNA viruses whose “evolutionary rationale” is mysterious. The essentiality of RNAPII activity for viral transcription is due to the fact that the viral polymerase complex (PA,PB1,PB2) cannot transcribe viral genomic RNA by itself. Instead, it requires RNA leaders (primers) that are generated by PA-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage of the 5′ end of capped cellular transcripts in a process called “cap snatching” (Plotch et al., 1979Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Krug R.M. Transfer of 5′-terminal cap of globin mRNA to influenza viral complementary RNA during transcription in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As host and viral transcription are essential functions for IAV, the interaction between viral polymerase and RNAPII is not antagonistic, but reflects a balance between cellular activity and its usage by the virus (Woolhouse et al., 2002Woolhouse M.E. Webster J.P. Domingo E. Charlesworth B. Levin B.R. Biological and biomedical implications of the co-evolution of pathogens and their hosts.Nat.

These co-evolving dynamics between pathogens and hosts can shape cellular functions (Madhani, 2013Madhani H.D. The frustrated gene: origins of eukaryotic gene expression.Cell. 2013; 155: 744-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We report that IAV’s polymerase exploits the quality control mechanisms that lead to the degradation of 3′ end unprotected regulatory RNAs. A physical proximity to the exosome provides a temporal window, in sync with the kinetics of RNAPII, in which the viral polymerase steals the 5′ end caps of otherwise fully degraded RNAs, thus recycling “cellular junk RNAs” into chimeric RNAs that propel the viral life cycle. Human congenital mutations in many exosome subunits cause impaired exosome activity and are associated with cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration (Wan et al., 2012Wan J. Yourshaw M. Mamsa H.

To discover key regulators of IAV biogenesis, we mapped the global interaction network of each viral polymerase subunit in A549 cells (Figure S1 and Table S1). We analyzed the PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits of two different viral strains (H1N1 and H3N2) that infect humans. We performed this study in the presence and absence of stimulation with exogenous interferon beta (IFNβ). Three biological replicates were completed for each condition to control for reproducibility and specificity of the scored interactions. Epitope-tagged IAV polymerase subunits were expressed alongside FLAG-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the FLAG-tag alone as negative controls. FLAG-purified bait, along with co-immunoprecipitated host and viral factors, were submitted for protein identification via mass spectrometry. Interaction scores and statistical analyses were optimized to identify unique virus-host interactions (Jäger et al., 2011Jäger S. Cimermancic P. Gulbahce N. Johnson J.R. McGovern K.E. Clarke S.C. Shales M. Mercenne G. Pache L. Li K. et al.Global landscape of HIV-human protein complexes.Nature. 2011; 481: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This approach identified uniquely engaged host proteins by the polymerase subunits of both strains—in a resting state, as well as in an induced antiviral state (networks summarized in Figure S1 and Table S1). For both viruses, and in both resting and induced conditions, several members of the nuclear RNA exosome, a multisubunit complex with nucleolytic activity toward RNA (Januszyk and Lima, 2014Januszyk K. Lima C.D. The eukaryotic RNA exosome.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2014; 24: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, Tollervey, 2015Tollervey D. RNA surveillance and the exosome.RNA. 2015; 21: 492-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), were significantly enriched with the viral polymerase PA subunit (Figures 1A and 1B) and scored among the most highly engaged cellular protein complexes for both viral strains used (Figure 1C). The interaction between PA and EXOSC10 (Figures 1A–1C and Table S1) was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Figure 1D). Overall, these data suggest that the RNA exosome might play a role in the IAV life cycle. As the interaction with the exosome is strain-independent, we decided to focus our attention and perform functional analyses during infection with H1N1 influenza virus. To identify whether the RNA exosome affects IAV’s life cycle, we transiently knocked down (via small interfering RNA [siRNA]) the complex’s two catalytic subunits, EXOSC10 and DIS3, along with the essential core subunit, EXOSC3, in A549 cells. We then infected knockdown cells, along with control cells (siCTRL), with a H1N1 virus (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) and measured the products of viral transcription (viral mRNA) and replication (genomic RNA). The contribution of the copy RNA (cRNA) was not assessed, as it is a minor constituent of the viral transcript population (Honda et al., 2001Honda A. Endo A. Mizumoto K. Ishihama A.

The knockdown of all three subunits resulted in lowered amounts of viral polymerase RNA products at two time points post-infection (Figures 2A, 2B, 2D, S2A, S2B, S2D, and S2F ) without altering expression of prototypical antiviral genes (Figures 2C and S2C). Overall, these results suggest that the nuclear RNA exosome is, directly or indirectly, responsible for controlling IAV ribogenesis—possibly by promoting viral polymerase activity. To support this, we used an IAV-specific mini-genome assay, which confirmed that disruption of the RNA exosome alters viral transcriptional activity (Figure 2E). To determine if the observed reductions in viral polymerase activity impact viral growth, we utilized an IAV reporter virus that expresses renilla luciferase. Reduced DIS3 and EXOSC3 expression suppressed reporter virus amplification in both single-cycle (high MOI) and multi-cycle (low MOI) infection settings (Figure 2F). This result was also confirmed by plaque assay (Figure 2G). Notably, EXOSC3- and DIS3-depleted cells supported herpes simplex virus infection (Figure S2E). In summation, these data indicate that the RNA exosome could control viral replication in a cell-intrinsic manner and prompted us to use human and mouse genetics to validate our findings.Figure S2Loss of Function of RNA Exosome Subunits Suppresses Influenza Virus Ribogenesis and Growth, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–C) Influenza viral mRNA levels (A), viral RNA levels (B), and host infection-induced target gene mRNA levels (C) (measured by qPCR) in human A549 cells infected with the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 strain at the indicated time points.

To detect whether the viral polymerase-RNA exosome axis was functional in human biology, we made use of patient-derived dermal fibroblasts that bear a point mutation (Asp132Ala) in EXOSC3. This mutation partially compromises the exosome’s enzymatic activity (Wan et al., 2012Wan J. Yourshaw M. Mamsa H. Rudnik-Schöneborn S. Menezes M.P. Hong J.E. Leong D.W. Senderek J. Salman M.S.

Genet. 2012; 44: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We verified that mutant EXOSC3 cells express increased levels of prototypical RNA exosome substrates (Figure S3A). We thus infected control cells (heterozygous familial carriers) and EXOSC3 mutant cells with IAV and analyzed cellular and viral RNAs, along with viral polymerase activity and viral growth, in an analogous fashion as done with transient depletion of exosome subunits (see Figure 2). These results (Figures 3A–3D) indicate that, upon IAV infection, (1) patient-derived cells with a disease-linked EXOSC3 mutation have a lower accumulation of viral RNA (Figures 3A and 3B), (2) levels of prototypical antiviral genes were unaffected (Figure 3C), and (3) in line with published results, mRNA expression of the wild-type and mutated alleles were equal (Figure 3D). As a result of impaired viral ribogenesis (Figures 3A and 3B) and polymerase activity (Figure 3E), viral growth was suppressed in patient-derived cells (Figures 3F and 3G). These data correlate the functionality of the RNA exosome to increased viral amplification. Overall, these results provide genetic support for the involvement of the RNA exosome in IAV ribogenesis in humans.Figure 3Patient-Derived Cells with EXOSC3 Mutation Suppress Viral Ribogenesis and GrowthShow full caption(A–C) qPCR of IAV viral mRNA (A), RNA (B), and host infection-induced gene mRNA levels (C) in primary dermal fibroblasts isolated from patients with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type I (affected; homozygous mutation, Asp132Ala) or family members (carrier; heterozygous mutation).

https://openalex.org/W2611758528,"Infertility is constantly increasing in Canada, where 16% of Canadian couples are experiencing difficulty conceiving. It is thought that infertility can emanate from the dysregulated communication between the embryo and the maternal endometrium. In order to allow for this window of implantation to be open at the right moment, endometrial stromal cells proliferate and differentiate by a mechanism called decidualization. Intracellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation during decidualization of the endometrium are yet to be fully understood. It has been well demonstrated previously that Akt is importantly involved in cell survival and glycogen synthesis. Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3 isoforms have distinct physiological roles; this could also be the case during decidualization and pregnancy. The aim of this study is to investigate the regulation of PI3K/Akt pathway during the decidualization process of endometrial stromal cells. Expression of Akt isoforms, Akt activity (phospho-Akt), pIκB and substrates of Akt during decidualization were measured. To our knowledge, these results are the first to suggest a decrease in levels of Akt isoforms as well as a downregulation of Akt activity in the process of decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells. We also uncovered that decidualization induced nuclear localization of p65 through the phosphorylation of IκB, its inhibitory subunit; however, Par-4, a recently uncovered regulator of cell differentiation, was displaced from the nucleus upon decidualization. Our results also suggest that HIESC cells exhibit decreased motility during decidualization and that PI3K pathway inhibition could be involved in this process. Finally, we demonstrate that specific Akt isoforms present unique effects on the successful induction of decidualization. Further analyses will involve investigations to understand the precise signaling mechanisms by which this pathway is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2610633384,"Senecavirus A (SVA), previously known as Seneca Valley virus, was first isolated in the United States in 2002. SVA was associated with porcine idiopathic vesicular disease in Canada and the USA in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Recent increase in SVA outbreaks resulting in neonatal mortality of piglets and/or vesicular lesions in sows in Brazil, the USA and Canada point to the necessity to study the pathogenicity and molecular epidemiology of the virus. Here, we report the analysis of the complete coding sequences of SVA from 2 clinical cases and 9 assembly yard environmental samples collected in 2015 in Canada, along with 22 previously released complete genomes in the GenBank. With this combined data set, the evolution of the SVA over a 12-month period in 2015/2016 was evaluated. These SVA isolates were characterized by a rapid accumulation of genetic variations driven mainly by a high nucleotide substitution rate and purifying selection. The SVA sequences clustered in clearly defined geographical areas with reported cases of SVA infection. No transmission links were identified between assembly yards, suggesting that point source introductions may have occurred. In addition, 25 fixed non-synonymous mutations were identified across all analyzed strains when compared to the prototype SVA strain (SVV-001). This study highlights the importance of monitoring SVA mutations for their role in increased virulence and impact on SVA diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2611680101,"Iron (Fe) uptake in graminaceous plant species occurs via the release and uptake of Fe-chelating compounds known as mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs). In the MAs biosynthetic pathway, nicotianamine aminotransferase (NAAT) and deoxymugineic acid synthase (DMAS) enzymes catalyse the formation of 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) from nicotianamine (NA). Here we describe the identification and characterisation of six TaNAAT and three TaDMAS1 genes in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The coding sequences of all six TaNAAT homeologs consist of seven exons with ≥88.0% nucleotide sequence identity and most sequence variation present in the first exon. The coding sequences of the three TaDMAS1 homeologs consist of three exons with ≥97.8% nucleotide sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the TaNAAT and TaDMAS1 proteins are most closely related to the HvNAAT and HvDMAS1 proteins of barley and that there are two distinct groups of TaNAAT proteins-TaNAAT1 and TaNAAT2 -that correspond to the HvNAATA and HvNAATB proteins, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the TaNAAT2 genes are expressed at highest levels in anther tissues whilst the TaNAAT1 and TaDMAS1 genes are expressed at highest levels in root tissues of bread wheat. Furthermore, the TaNAAT1, TaNAAT2 and TaDMAS1 genes were differentially regulated by plant Fe status and their expression was significantly upregulated in root tissues from day five onwards during a seven-day Fe deficiency treatment. The identification and characterization of the TaNAAT1, TaNAAT2 and TaDMAS1 genes provides a valuable genetic resource for improving bread wheat growth on Fe deficient soils and enhancing grain Fe nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2610206635,"Objectives Evaluate trends from 2011–2015 in electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use among U.S. adolescents, grades 6–12, including prevalence and associations with past month use of cigarettes and other tobacco products, cigarette smoking intensity, quit attempts, and quit contemplation. Methods Five consecutive waves from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (N = 101,011) were used to estimate the grade- and race/ethnicity-standardized prevalence of past month use of e-cigarettes and nine non e-cigarette tobacco products. We assessed linear trends by year and compared outcomes (e.g., tobacco use, smoking intensity) by e-cigarette past month use. Results Past month e-cigarette use rose sharply from 2011–2015. In all years and both sexes, e-cigarette past month use and ever use were positively associated with use of cigarettes and other tobacco products, with past month e-cigarette use reaching 52% in 2015 among individuals who used ≥1 non e-cigarette tobacco product in the past month. Meanwhile, from 2011–2015, the population of adolescent past month e-cigarette users increasingly encompassed adolescents who were not past month users of other products (females: 19.0% to 41.7%; males: 11.1% to 36.7%) or had never used other products (females: 7.1% to 13.5%; males: 6.7% to 15.0%). Among male (but not female) past month cigarette users, there was a statistically significant positive association between past month e-cigarette use and daily cigarette smoking but not in all individual years. Past month e-cigarette use among past month cigarette smokers was not associated with cigarette quit attempts or quit contemplation, with no temporal trend. Conclusion Adolescent past month e-cigarette use is associated with past month use of other tobacco but not with cigarette quit attempts or quit contemplation among cigarette users. Over five years, the average characteristics of U.S. adolescents who use e-cigarettes have shifted, increasingly including more adolescents who do not use non e-cigarette tobacco products."
https://openalex.org/W2610244485,"The present paper examines modes of immigrants' labor market incorporation into European societies with specific emphasis on the role played by immigrant status (i.e. first-generation immigrants, immigrant descendants and native born without migrant background), region of origin, and gender. The data were obtained from the European Union Labour Forces Survey 2008 Ad-Hoc Module for France, Belgium, UK and Sweden. In order to supplement the results from the country-specific analysis, we replicated the analysis using pooled data from the five rounds of the European Social Survey conducted between 2002 and 2010, for nine 'old immigration' Western European countries together. The analysis centered on two aspects of incorporation: labor force status and occupation. Multinominal, binary logistic as well as linear probability regression models were estimated. The findings suggest that in all countries non-European origin is associated with greater disadvantage in finding employment not only among first-generation immigrants, but also among sons and daughters of immigrants (i.e. second-generation). Moreover, the relative employment disadvantage among immigrant men of non-European origin is especially pronounced in the second-generation. The likelihood of attaining a high-status job is influenced mostly by immigrant status, regardless of region of origin and gender. The results of the study reveal that patterns of labor force incorporation vary considerably across origin groups and across generations. The patterns do not vary as much across countries, despite cross-country differences in welfare state regimes, migration integration policy and composition of migration flows."
https://openalex.org/W2610465038,"Introduction Breathlessness is a common symptom of advanced disease placing a huge burden on patients, health systems and informal carers (families and friends providing daily help and support). It causes distress and isolation. Carers provide complex personal, practical and emotional support yet often feel ill-prepared to care. They lack knowledge and confidence in their caring role. The need to educate carers and families about breathlessness is established, yet we lack robustly developed carer-targeted educational interventions to meet their needs. Methods We conducted a qualitative interview study with twenty five purposively-sampled patient-carer dyads living with breathlessness in advanced disease (half living with advanced cancer and half with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We sought to identify carers’ educational needs (including what they wanted to learn about) and explore differences by diagnostic group in order to inform an educational intervention for carers of patients with breathlessness in advanced disease. Results There was a strong desire among carers for an educational intervention on breathlessness. Six key topics emerged as salient for them: 1) understanding breathlessness, 2) managing anxiety, panic and breathlessness, 3) managing infections, 4) keeping active, 5) living positively and 6) knowing what to expect in the future. A cross-cutting theme was relationship management: there were tensions within dyads resulting from mismatched expectations related to most topics. Carers felt that knowledge-gains would not only help them to support the patient better, but also help them to manage their own frustrations, anxieties, and quality of life. Different drivers for education need were identified by diagnostic group, possibly related to differences in caring role duration and resulting impacts. Conclusion Meeting the educational needs of carers requires robustly developed and evaluated interventions. This study provides the evidence-base for the content of an educational intervention for carers of patients with breathlessness in advanced disease."
https://openalex.org/W2610358825,"TRPV1 (vanilloid) receptors are activated by different types of stimuli including capsaicin, acidification and heat. Various ligands demonstrate stimulus-dependent action on TRPV1. In the present work we studied the action of polypeptides isolated from sea anemone Heteractis crispa (APHC1, APHC2 and APHC3) on rat TRPV1 receptors stably expressed in CHO cells using electrophysiological recordings, fluorescent Ca2+ measurements and molecular modeling. The APHCs potentiated TRPV1 responses to low (3–300 nM) concentrations of capsaicin but inhibited responses to high (>3.0 μM) concentrations. The activity-dependent action was also found for TRPV1 responses to 2APB and acidification. Thus the action mode of APHCs is bimodal and depended on the activation stimuli strength—potentiation of low-amplitude responses and no effect/inhibition of high-amplitude responses. The double-gate model of TRPV1 activation suggests that APHC-polypeptides may stabilize an intermediate state during the receptor activation. Molecular modeling revealed putative binding site at the outer loops of TRPV1. Binding to this site can directly affect activation by protons and can be allosterically coupled with capsaicin site. The results are important for further investigations of both TRPV1 and its ligands for potential therapeutic use."
https://openalex.org/W2610441145,"Biological insecticides based on Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) can efficiently control S. exigua larvae on field and greenhouse crops in many parts of the world. Spanish wild populations and laboratory colonies of S. exigua are infected by two iflaviruses (SeIV-1 and SeIV-2). Here we evaluated the effect of iflavirus co-infection on the insecticidal characteristics of SeMNPV occlusion bodies (OBs). Overall, iflavirus co-inoculation consistently reduced median lethal concentrations (LC50) for SeMNPV OBs compared to larvae infected with SeMNPV alone. However, the speed of kill of SeMNPV was similar in the presence or absence of the iflaviruses. A reduction of the weight gain (27%) associated with iflavirus infection resulted in a 30% reduction in total OB production per larva. Adult survivors of SeMNPV OB inoculation were examined for covert infection. SeMNPV DNA was found to be present at a high prevalence in all SeIV-1 and SeIV-2 co-infection treatments. Interestingly, co-inoculation of SeMNPV with SeIV-2 alone or in mixtures with SeIV-1 resulted in a significant increase in the SeMNPV load of sublethally infected adults, suggesting a role for SeIV-2 in vertical transmission or reactivation of sublethal SeMNPV infections. In conclusion, iflaviruses are not desirable in insect colonies used for large scale baculovirus production, as they may result in diminished larval growth, reduced OB production and, depending on their host-range, potential risks to non-target Lepidoptera."
https://openalex.org/W2611470200,"The niche, as first conceptualized, was in conflict with the prevailing wisdom that stem cells have internal logic. The niche hypothesis has been indisputably confirmed. Yet, recent findings indicate little plasticity of epigenetically scripted hematopoietic stem/progenitors. Reconciling this conflict requires re-envisioning the niche as an enabler, not designer, of cell fate. The niche, as first conceptualized, was in conflict with the prevailing wisdom that stem cells have internal logic. The niche hypothesis has been indisputably confirmed. Yet, recent findings indicate little plasticity of epigenetically scripted hematopoietic stem/progenitors. Reconciling this conflict requires re-envisioning the niche as an enabler, not designer, of cell fate. As we near four decades since Schofield first formally articulated the concept of a stem cell niche, it is interesting to note that controversies surrounding his proposal in 1978 are now re-surfacing with recent experimental data. Specifically, Schofield’s theory that stem cells were dependent on their interactions with a specialized microenvironment included basic notions that the niche could determine the differentiation state, number, and persistence of stem cells (Schofield, 1978Schofield R. Blood Cells. 1978; 4: 7-25PubMed Google Scholar). It provoked colleagues at the time, prominently Ernest McCullough, who had experimentally defined that stem cells exist. The objections raised were based on the prevailing wisdom that stem cells sat atop a hierarchical, highly linear pattern of branching differentiation governed by their own internal logic. As Schofield’s concept of a niche acquired experimental definition in hematopoiesis, his range of tenants for the functions of a niche was largely considered to be true and extended to the notion that hematopoietic cell differentiation state could be regulated and even imposed by the niche. In some niches such as the Drosophila germ cell niche, maturing descendants of the germ cell were indeed shown to acquire at least morphologic features of a stem cell if re-exposed to the niche. This imposition of cell differentiation state onto a cell had further support in settings like the vacated niche of mammalian intestine or airway epithelial cells. In contexts of injury, the state of cells could be reverted in a manner thought to be dependent on predetermined niche environments (reviewed in Xin et al., 2016Xin T. Greco V. Myung P. Cell. 2016; 164: 1212-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, whether cell differentiation events were determined by niche signals under homeostatic conditions had not been shown, though they were thought to be likely to occur. The multipotentiality of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) has been experimentally demonstrated through transplantation. Typically, immunophenotypically isolated subpopulations of bone marrow hematopoietic cells were injected into irradiated recipient mice and the ability of the cells to produce mature cells of different types was scored. Those populations producing myeloid and lymphoid cells were considered multipotent and the relative production of the candidate cell types was thought to be governed by exogenous signals that swayed differential potential from a neutral “poised” state to a lineage-committed one. Molecularly, the poised state has been hypothesized to be cells expressing low levels of transcription factors that were associated with specific, alternative outcomes but were at sub-threshold levels for lineage commitment. For example, the co-expression of low levels of molecules like CEBPalpha, which is critical for neutrophil differentiation, and PU.1, which is critical for monocyte differentiation, was proposed to be in relative balance in progenitors with neutrophil and monocyte potential (Laslo et al., 2006Laslo P. Spooner C.J. Warmflash A. Lancki D.W. Lee H.J. Sciammas R. Gantner B.N. Dinner A.R. Singh H. Cell. 2006; 126: 755-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Under direction of extrinsic factors like the cytokine G-CSF, increased expression of particular factors (e.g., CEBPalpha) could trigger a stoichiometric imbalance leading to lineage-specific differentiation. Secondary events from driver transcription factor expression could include counter antagonist regulators to suppress alternative fate options, thereby enforcing lineage commitment. However, recent elegant single-cell tracking studies have examined this hypothesis in detail. Using distinct fluorometric markers knocked into the loci of either GATA1 or PU.1 expression, Timm Shroeder and colleagues conducted single-cell tracing of transcription factor expression at the protein level. They demonstrated that cells do not co-express these fluors, and by extension these transcriptional regulators, even when putatively multipotent (Hoppe et al., 2016Hoppe P.S. Schwarzfischer M. Loeffler D. Kokkaliaris K.D. Hilsenbeck O. Moritz N. Endele M. Filipczyk A. Gambardella A. Ahmed N. et al.Nature. 2016; 535: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Rather, progenitors express one or the other and ultimately achieve the cell fate driven by them. While it is possible that the proteins were expressed at levels not detectable in the system, the data raise an experimental challenge to the notion of multipotent cells suspended in a poised state with multiple alternative outcomes driven by exogenous stimuli. Other data has also raised the idea that cells have a pre-determined differentiation outcome. Single-cell transplants by Dykstra et al. demonstrated several different classes of cells with either multipotent or unipotent potential that were preserved on secondary transplantation (Dykstra et al., 2007Dykstra B. Kent D. Bowie M. McCaffrey L. Hamilton M. Lyons K. Lee S.J. Brinkman R. Eaves C. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 218-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). It is important to note that these studies were performed in the setting of an irradiated and thus vacated and altered niche. These studies required transplantation, leaving open the possibility that the functions observed were not those of homeostatic hematopoiesis. Using the approach of single-cell mRNA sequencing and single-cell lineage tracing on myeloid progenitors, studies recently defined multiple subsets of cells as classified by their transcription signatures. Strikingly, cells expressing multiple lineage-specific genes or transcription factors regulating different fates were not found. While no functional cell differentiation tracing was possible in these studies, the implication was that cells establish and maintain fate-driving gene expression signatures with limited plasticity (reviewed in Höfer and Rodewald, 2016Höfer T. Rodewald H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 43: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies indicate that stem and progenitor populations may be less than nimble in modulating their differentiation fate in response to input from their environment. This concept was further explored using a mouse engineered to achieve clone-specific fluorescent labeling in endogenous hematopoietic cells (Yu et al., 2016Yu V.W. Yusuf R.Z. Oki T. Wu J. Saez B. Wang X. Cook C. Baryawno N. Ziller M.J. Lee E. et al.Cell. 2016; 167 (e1317): 1310-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The ability to trace the cell production by any individual stem cell and isolate the cell based on its fluorescent tag offered two advantages. First, cells whose behavior was characterized under homeostatic conditions could be isolated and re-transplanted and whether their behavior was preserved in the setting of a new host microenvironment could be determined. This allowed direct testing of whether the niche drove differentiation outcomes of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Second, the isolated, behaviorally characterized HSCs could be subjected to molecular analyses and whether their transcriptome or epigenome predicted what fate the cells would acquire as they differentiated could be determined. This allowed assessment of the transcriptionally poised state hypothesis. The studies revealed that HSCs defined by their unique color had unique features: they produced color (clone)-distinctive numbers of particular progeny. For example, a red HSC might have produced more monocytes than B cells and might have been highly productive of offspring, while another color might proportionately make more lymphoid cells and generate only modest numbers of cells. Strikingly, when the HSCs were transplanted, they recreated highly similar patterns of cell production. Transplanting bone marrow from one donor into 20 recipients created 20 mice with virtually indistinguishable patterns of cell production by each colored HSC. The cells behaved the same even having gone through the rigors of transplantation and engrafting in a new host. This strongly favored McCulloch’s view of HSCs: they are governed by internal logic. Furthermore, HSCs whose behavior was well characterized in vivo were isolated, and their transcriptome, whole-genome DNA methylation pattern, and chromatin accessibility were analyzed. Cells that had clear preferential production of a particular lineage did not have evidence of that preference in their transcriptome, but they did have it evident in their epigenome. For example, a lymphoid-biased HSC had equal production of myeloid and lymphoid transcripts, but it had inactivating DNA methylation of myeloid enhancers and not lymphoid enhancers. The future fate of the HSC could be predicted from its epigenome. Therefore, while transcription levels may suggest a plastic poised state, lineage restriction is present, and it is present at the level of the epigenome. Why the epigenetic and chromatin accessibility patterns did not have accompanying gene expression profiles in stem cells may have a number of explanations. For example, the transcriptional activity of a particular gene may require expression of specific transcription factors not necessarily active in the HSC. Yet, the locus may be accessible to such factors when they accumulate. Collectively, these data indicate that HSC fate is highly individual. The HSC pool may have a wide range of activities, but individual clones have defined, highly stereotypic behaviors, even in a new host. The behavior of HSCs is scripted by epigenetic features. The study defining this behavior was conducted in young adult animals, suggesting that epigenetic fate is written beforehand during development. However, it is not yet known when the epigenetic features observed were established. Epigenetic and chromatin state features may well have been influenced by niche factors occurring at a time prior to the young adult stage that was studied. However, from the available data, it would appear that HSCs are not highly plastic cells, but cells with clone-specific capabilities that are not readily malleable: features very consistent with the McCulloch model of the hardwired HSC. Does the niche merely provide a resting place of convenience for highly autonomous cells? Does the unexpected consistency and epigenetic enforcement of HSC fate mean that Schofield was wrong? The answer is, clearly, “No.” A number of studies have indicated that when particular stromal cells are genetically modified, the number or cell cycle state of HSCs changes. Other studies have pointed toward specific types of niches that support different cellular subsets or different HSC activities. There has been progressive refinement in our understanding of which cells make the well-known regulators of HSC persistence, kit ligand (also referred to as stem cell factor or SCF) and CXCL12 (also known as SDF-1) (reviewed in Sanchez-Aguilera and Mendez-Ferrer, 2016Sanchez-Aguilera A. Mendez-Ferrer S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 74: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies focusing on the discovery of additional HSPC regulators have revealed new molecular and cellular participants in constraining HSPC proliferation. For example, it has been shown that megakaryocytes produce proteins that induce HSPC quiescence. Specifically, Frenette and colleagues showed that megakaryocyte production of platelet factor 4 (also known as CXCL4) directly altered the proliferative activity of HSPCs. Linheng Li and colleagues showed that megakaryocyte production of TGF-beta also enforces HSC quiescence. The laboratory of Toshio Suda showed that protein-C type lectin-like receptor2 (CLEC2) produced by megakaryocytes restrained HSC proliferation (reviewed in Sanchez-Aguilera and Mendez-Ferrer, 2016Sanchez-Aguilera A. Mendez-Ferrer S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 74: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Further, it has been shown that a subset of endosteal cells physically associated with transplanted HSPCs produce quiescence inducers of different molecular classes: a cytokine (IL-18), an adhesion regulator (embigin), and a secreted RNAase (angiogenin) (Silberstein et al., 2016Silberstein L. Goncalves K.A. Kharchenko P.V. Turcotte R. Kfoury Y. Mercier F. Baryawno N. Severe N. Bachand J. Spencer J.A. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 530-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These data point toward there being function-specific niches: a plethora of different types of niches with specific features. Indeed, it may be that the degree of niche heterogeneity matches the heterogeneity within the HSPC pool itself, raising the possibility of functional pairings of stromal cells and the hematopoietic progenitors they regulate. Other work has shown that modifying stromal cell elements can lead to depletion of HSPCs sufficient to engender bone marrow failure. Further, modifications of specific subsets of mesenchymal cells can lead to myelodysplasia and even frank leukemia (reviewed in Sanchez-Aguilera and Mendez-Ferrer, 2016Sanchez-Aguilera A. Mendez-Ferrer S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 74: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, the niche plays an essential role in preserving HSPCs, modifying their cycling, and even assuring the integrity of the differentiation process. Schofield was correct. The conflicting notions of McCulloch and Schofield have each acquired experimental weight since the days of their highly contentious debate. Schofield’s concept, experimentally confirmed in 2003, has gained thousands of published reports supporting it. These include studies that have extended his original proposed functions of the niche regarding differentiation. He hypothesized that the niche restricted differentiation to preserve the stem cell state of HSCs (reviewed in Morrison and Scadden, 2014Morrison S.J. Scadden D.T. Nature. 2014; 505: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). This has still not been fully elucidated experimentally, but because differentiation events were dysfunctional due to perturbed stromal cells in some experiments or stromal production of cytokines needed to achieve differentiation outcomes in others (Schofield, 1978Schofield R. Blood Cells. 1978; 4: 7-25PubMed Google Scholar), considering the niche a governor of differentiation was a reasonable conclusion. Yet, the increasing experimental evidence that HSC differentiation fate is largely cell intrinsic requires rethinking of how the niche participates in differentiation. It may provide supportive rather than instructive input to the scripted functions of HSCs. The niche is needed to enable preservation and even conduct the hematopoietic program; evidence for that is strong. However, it should not be regarded as the driver of the cell differentiation program. That would seem to belong to the cell itself; that is the domain of McCulloch. The stem cell-centric (McCulloch) or niche-centric (Schofield) views of hematopoiesis can be reconciled. The niche is required and enables the hardwired programming of the HSC to run, but it plays little, if any, role in coding that program. Perhaps fittingly in a world in need of compromise, both views carry truth and the resolution seems somewhere in the middle. A number of prior studies support the concept of HSC heterogeneity and apologize to those authors that journal space constraints limit our citing their work. The contribution of Karin Ulla Gustafsson is greatly acknowledged for thoughtful input and editing."
https://openalex.org/W2610239039,"Noninvasive methods to accurately and conveniently evaluate liver fibrosis are desirable. MicroRNA (miR) is one of the candidates. MiRs are small RNAs consisting of 19-25 nucleotides that negatively regulate many target genes at transcriptional levels. Recently, many researchers have focused on circulating miRs in the blood stream as biomarkers. Hepatic miR-122 has been reported to have an association with viral replication and hepatic fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatic C virus (HCV) infection.We measured serum miR-122 levels in HBV- and HCV-infected patients confirmed with liver biopsy. We also investigated a novel liver fibrosis marker Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein [WFA(+)-M2BP]. We evaluated the diagnostic usefulness of these markers in hepatic fibrosis and inflammation of patients with chronic viral infection.The serum miR-122 levels of HBV-infected patients were higher than those of the control subjects. In HBV-infected patients, the serum miR-122 levels of patients with advanced liver fibrosis were significantly lower. Serum WFA(+)-M2BP was significantly higher dependent on both the staging of fibrosis and the grading of inflammatory activity in patients with both HBV and HCV infection. We also observed that higher serum WFA(+)-M2BP levels augmented the prediction of advanced liver fibrosis among HBV-infected patients with lower serum miR-122 levels.A lower serum miR-122 level is a useful predictor of advanced liver fibrosis in HBV-infected patients. Serum WFA(+)-M2BP could predict liver fibrosis in both HBV and HCV infection. The combination of these markers may result in the more accurate evaluation of liver fibrosis in HBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2611127115,"Introduction We recently identified a set of plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) that are downregulated in patients with heart failure in comparison with control subjects. To better understand their meaning and function, we sought to validate these circulating miRNAs in 3 different well-established rat and mouse heart failure models, and correlated the miRNAs to parameters of cardiac function. Methods The previously identified let-7i-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-18a-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-30e-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-423-3p, miR-423-5p and miR-652-3p were measured by means of quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in plasma samples of 8 homozygous TGR(mREN2)27 (Ren2) transgenic rats and 8 (control) Sprague-Dawley rats, 6 mice with angiotensin II-induced heart failure (AngII) and 6 control mice, and 8 mice with ischemic heart failure and 6 controls. Circulating miRNA levels were compared between the heart failure animals and healthy controls. Results Ren2 rats, AngII mice and mice with ischemic heart failure showed clear signs of heart failure, exemplified by increased left ventricular and lung weights, elevated end-diastolic left ventricular pressures, increased expression of cardiac stress markers and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. All miRNAs were detectable in plasma from rats and mice. No significant differences were observed between the circulating miRNAs in heart failure animals when compared to the healthy controls (all P>0.05) and no robust associations with cardiac function could be found. Conclusions The previous observation that miRNAs circulate in lower levels in human patients with heart failure could not be validated in well-established rat and mouse heart failure models. These results question the translation of data on human circulating miRNA levels to experimental models, and vice versa the validity of experimental miRNA data for human heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2611586847,"Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is a morbillivirus that produces clinical disease in goats and sheep. We have studied the induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) following infection of cultured cells with wild-type and vaccine strains of PPRV, and the effects of such infection with PPRV on the induction of IFN-β through both MDA-5 and RIG-I mediated pathways. Using both reporter assays and direct measurement of IFN-β mRNA, we have found that PPRV infection induces IFN-β only weakly and transiently, and the virus can actively block the induction of IFN-β. We have also generated mutant PPRV that lack expression of either of the viral accessory proteins (V&C) to characterize the role of these proteins in IFN-β induction during virus infection. Both PPRV_ΔV and PPRV_ΔC were defective in growth in cell culture, although in different ways. While the PPRV V protein bound to MDA-5 and, to a lesser extent, RIG-I, and over-expression of the V protein inhibited both IFN-β induction pathways, PPRV lacking V protein expression can still block IFN-β induction. In contrast, PPRV C bound to neither MDA-5 nor RIG-I, but PPRV lacking C protein expression lost the ability to block both MDA-5 and RIG-I mediated activation of IFN-β. These results shed new light on the inhibition of the induction of IFN-β by PPRV."

Through Canada’s Inter-Agency Wild Bird Influenza Survey, close to 20,000 apparently healthy, wild dabbling ducks (of seven species) were tested for AIV between 2005 and 2011. We used these data to identify and evaluate ecological and demographic correlates of infection with low pathogenic AIVs in wild dabbling ducks (Anas spp.) across Canada. Generalized linear mixed effects model analyses revealed that risk of AIV infection was higher in hatch-year birds compared to adults, and was positively associated with a high proportion of hatch-year birds in the population. Males were more likely to be infected than females in British Columbia and in Eastern Provinces of Canada, but more complex relationships among age and sex cohorts were found in the Prairie Provinces. A species effect was apparent in Eastern Canada and British Columbia, where teal (A. discors and/or A. carolinensis) were less likely to be infected than mallards (A. platyrhynchos). Risk of AIV infection increased with the density of the breeding population, in both Eastern Canada and the Prairie Provinces, and lower temperatures preceding sampling were associated with a higher probability of AIV infection in Eastern Canada. Our results provide new insights into the ecological and demographic factors associated with AIV infection in waterfowl."

Comparing Ghanaians living in their country of origin to those living in Europe offers an opportunity to investigate smoking by location of residence and the associations between smoking behaviours and migration-related factors.Data on a relatively homogenous group of Ghanaians living in London (n = 949), Amsterdam (n = 1400), Berlin (n = 543), rural Ghana (n = 973) and urban Ghana (n = 1400) from the cross-sectional RODAM (Research on Obesity & Diabetes in African Migrants) study were used. Age-standardized prevalence rates of smoking by location of residence and factors associated with smoking among Ghanaian men were estimated using prevalence ratios (PR: 95% CIs).Current smoking was non-existent among women in rural and urban Ghana and London but was 3.2% and 3.3% in women in Amsterdam and Berlin, respectively. Smoking prevalence was higher in men in Europe (7.8%) than in both rural and urban Ghana (4.8%): PR 1.91: 95% CI 1.27, 2.88, adjusted for age, marital status, education and employment. Factors associated with a higher prevalence of smoking among Ghanaian men included European residence, being divorced or widowed, living alone, Islam religion, infrequent attendance at religious services, assimilation (cultural orientation), and low education.Ghanaians living in Europe are more likely to smoke than their counterparts in Ghana, suggesting convergence to European populations, although prevalence rates are still far below those in the host populations."
https://openalex.org/W2611635000,"A devastating complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection is cerebral malaria, in which vascular leakage and cerebral swelling lead to coma and often death. P. falciparum produces a protein called histidine-rich protein II (HRPII) that accumulates to high levels in the bloodstream of patients and serves as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for falciparum malaria. Using a human cerebral microvascular endothelial barrier model, we previously found that HRPII activates the endothelial cell inflammasome, resulting in decreased integrity of tight junctions and increased endothelial barrier permeability. Here, we report that intravenous administration of HRPII induced blood-brain barrier leakage in uninfected mice. Furthermore, HRPII infusion in P. berghei-infected mice increased early mortality from experimental cerebral malaria. These data support the hypothesis that HRPII is a virulence factor that contributes to cerebral malaria by compromising the integrity of the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2610242902,"Background Stroke, like many long-term conditions, tends to be managed in isolation of its associated risk factors and multimorbidity. With increasing access to clinical and research data there is the potential to combine data from a variety of sources to inform interventions to improve healthcare. A ‘Learning Health System’ (LHS) is an innovative model of care which transforms integrated data into knowledge to improve healthcare. The objective of this study is to develop a process of engaging stakeholders in the use of clinical and research data to co-produce potential solutions, informed by a LHS, to improve long-term care for stroke survivors with multimorbidity. Methods We used a stakeholder engagement study design informed by co-production principles to engage stakeholders, including service users, carers, general practitioners and other health and social care professionals, service managers, commissioners of services, policy makers, third sector representatives and researchers. Over a 10 month period we used a range of methods including stakeholder group meetings, focus groups, nominal group techniques (priority setting and consensus building) and interviews. Qualitative data were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results 37 participants took part in the study. The concept of how data might drive intervention development was difficult to convey and understand. The engagement process led to four priority areas for needs for data and information being identified by stakeholders: 1) improving continuity of care; 2) improving management of mental health consequences; 3) better access to health and social care; and 4) targeting multiple risk factors. These priorities informed preliminary design interventions. The final choice of intervention was agreed by consensus, informed by consideration of the gap in evidence and local service provision, and availability of robust data. This shaped a co-produced decision support tool to improve secondary prevention after stroke for further development. Conclusions Stakeholder engagement to identify data-driven solutions is feasible but requires resources. While a number of potential interventions were identified, the final choice rested not just on stakeholder priorities but also on data availability. Further work is required to evaluate the impact and implementation of data-driven interventions for long-term stroke survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2610671673,"Bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL) is a lipolytic digestive enzyme with broad substrate specificity secreted from exocrine pancreas into the intestinal lumen in all species and from the lactating mammary gland into the milk of some species, notably humans but not cows. BSSL in breast milk facilitates digestion and absorption of milk fat and promotes growth of small for gestational age preterm infants. Thus, purified recombinant human BSSL (rhBSSL) can be used for treatment of patients with fat malabsorption and expressing rhBSSL in the milk of transgenic cloned cows would therefore be a mean to meet a medical need. In the present study, a vector pBAC-hLF-hBSSL was constructed, which efficiently expressed active rhBSSL in milk of transgenic cloned cows to a concentration of 9.8 mg/ml. The rhBSSL purified from cow milk had the same enzymatic activity, N-terminal amino acid sequence, amino acid composition and isoelectric point and similar physicochemical characteristics as human native BSSL. Our study supports the use of transgenic cattle for the cost-competitive, large-scale production of therapeutic rhBSSL."
https://openalex.org/W2611371723,"Phylogeographical studies have suggested that several plant species on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) underwent recolonization during the Quaternary and may have had distinct range dynamics in response to the last glacial. To further test this hypothesis and locate the possible historical dispersal routes, we selected 20 plant species from different parts of the TP and modeled their geographical distributions over four time periods using species distribution models (SDMs). Furthermore, we applied the least-cost path method together with SDMs and shared haplotypes to estimate their historical dispersal corridors. We identified three general scenarios of species distribution change during the late Quaternary: the ‘contraction-expansion’ scenario for species in the northeastern TP, the ‘expansion-contraction’ scenario for species in the southeast and the ‘stable’ scenario for widespread species. During the Quaternary, we identified that these species were likely to recolonize along the low-elevation valleys, huge mountain ranges and flat plateau platform (e.g. the Yarlung Zangbo Valley and the Himalaya). We inferred that Quaternary cyclic glaciations along with the various topographic and climatic conditions of the TP could have resulted in the diverse patterns of range shift and dispersal of Tibetan plant species. Finally, we believe that this study would provide valuable insights for the conservation of alpine species under future climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2611477088,"Improved awareness of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission has contributed to the overall decline in the HCV infection rate in some developing countries including Thailand. Chronic HCV infection in some rural Thai communities, however, presents a challenge in the efforts to treat and manage HCV-related diseases. Published and unpublished studies have suggested an unusually high incidence of HCV infection in a Thai province of Phetchabun compared to elsewhere in Thailand. To determine the magnitude of HCV infection and identify potential factors contributing to the higher rate of HCV infection in this province, we performed a population-based study in Phetchabun (n = 1667) and the neighboring Khon Kaen province (n = 1410) where HCV prevalence is much lower. Individuals between 30 and 64 years old completed detailed questionnaires designed to identify HCV risk factors and provided blood samples for anti-HCV antibody screening. The anti-HCV seropositive rates were 15.5% (259/1667) in Phetchabun and 3.6% (51/1410) in Khon Kaen. Positive samples were subsequently genotyped for HCV core gene sequence and assessed for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and human immunodeficiency virus antigen/antibody (HIV Ag/Ab). More individuals in Phetchabun possessed the combined presence of HBsAg (5.0%) and HIV Ag/Ab (0.4%) than those in Khon Kaen (3.9% HBsAg and 0.0% HIV Ag/Ab). While male gender, intravenous drug use (IVDU) and tattoos were significant HCV risk factors in both provinces (p <0.05), education less than high school and agriculture-related occupation were additionally associated with HCV in Phetchabun. HCV genotypes 6, 3, and 1 were identified in similar frequency in both provinces. We estimated that prevalence of HCV seropositivity and viremic carriers were higher in Phetchabun (143 and 111 per 1000) than in Khon Kaen (34 and 22 per 1000). Finally, we derived a simple risk factor-based scoring system as a useful preclinical tool to screen individuals at risk of chronic HCV infection prior to intervention. Knowledge gained from this study will assist in HCV screening and promote access to anti-viral treatment in high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2611227961,"The aims of this study were to analyze the causes of morbidity and mortality in a large population of seabirds admitted to the Tafira Wildlife Rehabilitation Center (TWRC) in Gran Canaria Island, Spain, from 2003 to 2013, and to analyze the outcomes of the rehabilitation process.We included 1,956 seabirds (133 dead on admission and 1,823 admitted alive) in this study. Causes of morbidity were classified into nine categories: light pollution (fallout), fishing gear interaction, crude oil, poisoning/intoxication, other traumas, metabolic/nutritional disorder, orphaned young birds, other causes, and unknown/undetermined. The crude and stratified (by causes of admission) rates of the three final disposition categories (euthanasia Er, unassisted mortality Mr, and release Rr), the time until death, and the length of stay were also studied for the seabirds admitted alive.Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) was the species most frequently admitted (46.52%), followed by Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) (20.09%). The most frequent causes of morbidity were light pollution (fallout) (25.81%), poisoning/intoxication (24.69%), and other traumas (18.14%). The final disposition rates were: Er = 15.35%, Mr = 16.29%, and Rr = 68.34%. The highest Er was observed in the 'other traumas' category (58.08%). Seabirds admitted due to metabolic/nutritional disorder had the highest Mr (50%). The highest Rr was observed in the light pollution (fallout) category (99.20%).This survey provides useful information for the conservation of several seabird species. We suggest that at least the stratified analysis by causes of admission of the three final disposition rates, and the parameters time until death and length of stay at the center should be included in the outcome research of the rehabilitation of seabirds. The high release rate for seabirds (68.34%) achieved at the TWRC emphasizes the importance of wildlife rehabilitation centers for the conservation of seabirds."
https://openalex.org/W2610542855,"The activity of Schwann cells (SWCs) is very important in trauma-induced nerve repair, and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) produced during tissue injury inhibits the viability of SWCs, which delays the repair of peripheral nerves. Loganin is an iridoid glycoside that has been shown to alleviate a variety of cytotoxic effects. In the current study, we evaluated the potential efficacy and the mechanism of action of loganin in TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity in SW10 cells. The experimental results indicated that loganin blocked TNF-α-mediated Smad2 activation, downregulated the expression of the G1 phase cell cycle inhibitor p15IN4KB, and upregulated the expression of the G1 phase cell cycle activator cyclin D1-CDK4/6, which upregulated E2F-1-dependent survivin expression and relieved TNF-α-induced apoptosis in SW10 cells. The protective effect of loganin on SWCs has potential medicinal value in the promotion of peripheral nerve repair and is significant for studies in the field of tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2610546639,"Sensitivity to the regularities and structure contained within sequential, goal-directed actions is an important building block for generating expectations about the actions we observe. Until now, research on statistical learning for actions has solely focused on individual action sequences, but many actions in daily life involve multiple actors in various interaction contexts. The current study is the first to investigate the role of statistical learning in tracking regularities between actions performed by different actors, and whether the social context characterizing their interaction influences learning. That is, are observers more likely to track regularities across actors if they are perceived as acting jointly as opposed to in parallel? We tested adults and toddlers to explore whether social context guides statistical learning and-if so-whether it does so from early in development. In a between-subjects eye-tracking experiment, participants were primed with a social context cue between two actors who either shared a goal of playing together ('Joint' condition) or stated the intention to act alone ('Parallel' condition). In subsequent videos, the actors performed sequential actions in which, for certain action pairs, the first actor's action reliably predicted the second actor's action. We analyzed predictive eye movements to upcoming actions as a measure of learning, and found that both adults and toddlers learned the statistical regularities across actors when their actions caused an effect. Further, adults with high statistical learning performance were sensitive to social context: those who observed actors with a shared goal were more likely to correctly predict upcoming actions. In contrast, there was no effect of social context in the toddler group, regardless of learning performance. These findings shed light on how adults and toddlers perceive statistical regularities across actors depending on the nature of the observed social situation and the resulting effects."
https://openalex.org/W2610970585,"Uncaria tomentosa (Willd. ex Schult.) DC., a plant native to the Amazon region, is used widely in popular medicine and by the pharmaceutical industry because of its anti-inflammatory activity. However, the survival of this species is endangered by deforestation and indiscriminate collection, and a preservation plan is urgently required. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic and chemical variability between and within eight populations of U. tomentosa from the Brazilian states of Acre, Pará and Amapá, and to investigate possible correlations between genetic and geographical distances, and between geographical distances or altitude and the accumulation of bioactive oxindole alkaloids. Three sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers were employed to fingerprint genomic DNA, and the amounts of mitraphylline and isomitraphylline in leaf samples were established by high-performance liquid chromatography. Although significant divergence existed between the tested populations (FST = 0.246), the largest genetic diversity and the highest percentage of polymorphism (95.68%) was found within the population from Mâncio Lima, Acre. Gene flow was considered rather limited (Nm = 1.57), and no correlations between genetic and geographical distances were detected, suggesting that population structure followed an island model. Accumulations of mitraphylline and isomitraphylline varied in the range 32.94 to 0.57 and 3.75 to 0.36 mg g-1 dry weight, respectively. The concentration of isomitraphylline was positively influenced by altitude, such that the population collected at the site with the highest elevation (Tarauacá, Acre) exhibited the greatest alkaloid content. SRAP markers were very efficient in fingerprinting genomic DNA from U. tomentosa populations and clearly showed that genetic variability within populations was greater than between populations. A conservation and management plan should prioritize the creation of germplasm banks to prevent the loss of existing genetic variability, particularly within alkaloid-rich populations such as those of Tarauacá."
https://openalex.org/W2611238156,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are an interesting sample for searching for biomarkers with proteomic techniques because they are easy to obtain and do not contain highly abundant, potentially masking proteins. Two groups of pigs (n = 56) were subjected to mixing under farm conditions and afterwards subjected to different management treatments: negative handling (NH) and positive handling (PH). Serum and PBMC samples were collected at the beginning of the experiment one week after mixing (t0) and after two months of different handling (t2). Brain areas were collected after slaughter and neurotransmitters quantified by HPLC. Hair cortisol and serum acute phase proteins decreased and serum glutathione peroxidase increased at t2, indicating a lower degree of stress at t2 after adaptation to the farm. Differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE) was applied to study the effects of time and treatment on the PBMC proteome. A total of 54 differentially expressed proteins were identified, which were involved in immune system modulation, cell adhesion and motility, gene expression, splicing and translation, protein degradation and folding, oxidative stress and metabolism. Thirty-seven protein spots were up-regulated at t2 versus t0 whereas 27 were down-regulated. Many of the identified proteins share the characteristic of being potentially up or down-regulated by cortisol, indicating that changes in protein abundance between t0 and t2 are, at least in part, consequence of lower stress upon adaptation to the farm conditions after group mixing. Only slight changes in brain neurotransmitters and PBMC oxidative stress markers were observed. In conclusion, the variation in hair cortisol and serum APPs as well as the careful analysis of the identified proteins indicate that changes in protein composition in PBMC throughout time is mainly due to a decrease in the stress status of the individuals, following accommodation to the farm and the new group."
https://openalex.org/W2611798362,"The Ste20-like kinase, SLK, has diverse cellular functions. SLK mediates organ development, cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal remodeling, cytokinesis, and cell survival. Expression and activity of SLK are enhanced in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, and overexpression of SLK was shown to induce apoptosis in cultured glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) and renal tubular cells, as well as GEC/podocyte injury in vivo. The SLK protein consists of a N-terminal catalytic domain and an extensive C-terminal domain, which contains coiled-coils. The present study addresses the regulation of SLK activity. Controlled dimerization of the SLK catalytic domain enhanced autophosphorylation of SLK at T183 and S189, which are located in the activation segment. The full-length ectopically- and endogenously-expressed SLK was also autophosphorylated at T183 and S189. Using ezrin as a model SLK substrate (to address exogenous kinase activity), we demonstrate that dimerized SLK 1-373 or full-length SLK can effectively induce activation-specific phosphorylation of ezrin. Mutations in SLK, including T183A, S189A or T193A reduced T183 or S189 autophosphorylation, and showed a greater reduction in ezrin phosphorylation. Mutations in the coiled-coil region of full-length SLK that impair dimerization, in particular I848G, significantly reduced ezrin phosphorylation and tended to reduce autophosphorylation of SLK at T183. In experimental membranous nephropathy in rats, proteinuria and GEC/podocyte injury were associated with increased glomerular SLK activity and ezrin phosphorylation. In conclusion, dimerization via coiled-coils and phosphorylation of T183, S189 and T193 play key roles in the activation and signaling of SLK, and provide targets for novel therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2767014443,"Background The threshold of 2.3 skilled health workers per 1,000 population, published in the World Health Report in 2006, has galvanized resources and efforts to attain high coverage of skilled birth attendance. With the inception of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a new threshold of 4.45 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 1,000 population has been identified. This SDG index threshold indicates the minimum density to respond to the needs of health workers to deliver a much broader range of health services, such as management of non-communicable diseases to meet the targets under Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all people of all ages. In the United Republic of Tanzania, the density of skilled health workers in 2012 was 0.5 per 1,000 population, which more than doubled from 0.2 per 1,000 in 2002. However, this showed that Tanzania still faced a critical shortage of skilled health workers. While training, deployment, and retention are important, motivation is also necessary for all health workers, particularly those who serve in rural areas. This study measured the motivation of health workers who were posted at government-run rural primary health facilities. Objectives We sought to measure three aspects of motivation—Management, Performance, and Individual Aspects—among health workers deployed in rural primary level government health facilities. In addition, we also sought to identify the job-related attributes associated with each of these three aspects. Two regions in Tanzania were selected for our research. In each region, we further selected two districts in which we carried out our investigation. The two regions were Lindi, where we carried out our study in the Nachingwea District and the Ruangwa District, and Mbeya, within which the Mbarali and Rungwe Districts were selected for research. All four districts are considered rural. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted by administering a two-part questionnaire in the Kiswahili language. The first part was administered by a researcher, and contained questions for gaining socio-demographic and occupational information. The second part was a self-administered questionnaire that contained 45 statements used to measure three aspects of motivation among health workers. For analyzing the data, we performed multivariate regression analysis in order to evaluate the simultaneous effects of factors on the outcomes of the motivation scores in the three areas of Management, Performance, and Individual Aspects. Results Motivation was associated with marital status (p = 0.009), having a job description (p<0.001), and number of years in the current profession (<1 year: p = 0.043, >7 years: p = 0.042) for Management Aspects; having a job description (p<0.001) for Performance Aspects; and salary scale (p = 0.029) for Individual Aspects. Conclusion Having a clear job description motivates health workers. The existing Open Performance Review and Appraisal System, of which job descriptions are the foundation, needs to be institutionalized in order to effectively manage the health workforce in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2610280775,"We hypothesized that body mass-to-waist ratio is strongly associated with the total-body skeletal muscle volume (SMV) in children. The purpose of the present study was to examine this hypothesis.By using magnetic resonance imaging, total-body SMV (SMVMRI) was determined in 70 boys and 53 girls aged 6 to 12 years. Waist was measured at each of the level of umbilicus (Wumb) and the minimum circumference (Wmin), and the ratio of body mass to each of the two measured values was calculated (BM/Wumb and BM/Wmin, respectively). A single regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between SMVMRI and either BM/Wumb or BM/Wmin. On the basis of the obtained regression equations, SMVMRI was estimated and referred to as SMVBM/Wumb or SMVBM/Wmin.In both boys and girls, SMVMRI was highly correlated to BM/Wumb (r = 0.937 for boys and r = 0.939 for girls, P < 0.0001) and BM/Wmin (r = 0.915 and 0.942, P < 0.0001). R2 and the standard error of estimate for SMVBM/Wumb were 0.878 and 706.2 cm3, respectively, in boys and 0.882 and 825.3 cm3, respectively, in girls, and those for SMVBM/Wmin were 0.837 and 814.0 cm3, respectively, in boys and 0.888 and 804.1 cm3, respectively, in girls. In both boys and girls, there were no significant differences between SMVMRI and either SMVBM/Wumb or SMVBM/Wmin, without systematic errors in Band-Altman plots. There was no significant effect of model on the absolute values of the residuals in both boys and girls.The current results indicate that body mass-to-waist ratio can be a convenient outcome measure for assessing the total-body skeletal muscle volume in children."
https://openalex.org/W2611288380,"Following injury, distal axons undergo the process of Wallerian degeneration, and then cell debris is cleared to create a permissive environment for axon regeneration. The innate and adaptive immune systems are believed to be critical for facilitating the clearance of myelin and axonal debris during this process. However, immunodeficient animal models are regularly used in transplantation studies investigating cell therapies to modulate the degenerative/regenerative response. Given the importance of the immune system in preparing a permissive environment for regeneration by clearing debris, animals lacking, in part or in full, a functional immune system may have an impaired ability to regenerate due to poor myelin clearance, and may, thus, be poor hosts to study modulators of regeneration and degeneration. To study this hypothesis, three different mouse models with impaired adaptive immunity were compared to wild type animals in their ability to degenerate axons and clear myelin debris one week following sciatic nerve transection. Immunofluorescent staining for axons and quantitation of axon density with nerve histomorphometry of the distal stump showed no consistent discrepancy between immunodeficient and wild type animals, suggesting axons tended to degenerate equally between the two groups. Debris clearance was assessed by macrophage density and relative myelin basic protein expression within the denervated nerve stump, and no consistent impairment of debris clearance was found. These data suggested deficiency of the adaptive immune system does not have a substantial effect on axon degeneration one week following axonal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2611662293,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors are known to experience various symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life (QOL); therefore, it is important to identify clinical markers related with CRC survivor QOL. Here we investigated the relationship between serum chemerin levels, a newly identified proinflammatory adipokine, and QOL in CRC survivors. Methods A data of total of 110 CRC survivors were analysed in the study. Serum chemerin levels were measured with an enzyme immunoassay analyser. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scores were used as an indicator of QOL in CRC survivors. Results Weak but not negligible relationships were observed between serum chemerin levels and FACT-General (G) (r = -0.22, p<0.02), FACT-Colorectal cancer (C) (r = -0.23, p<0.02) and FACT-Fatigue (F) scores (r = -0.27, p<0.01) after adjusting for confounding factors. Both stepwise and enter method multiple linear regression analyses confirmed that serum chemerin levels were independently associated with FACT-G (stepwise: β = -0.15, p<0.01; enter: β = -0.12, p = 0.02), FACT-C (stepwise: β = -0.19, p<0.01; enter; β = -0.14, p = 0.02) and FACT-F scores (stepwise: β = -0.23, p<0.01; enter: β = -0.20, p<0.01). Conclusions Our results demonstrate a weak inverse relationship between serum chemerin and CRC survivor QOL. Although it is impossible to determine causality, our findings suggest that serum chemerin levels may have a significant association with CRC survivor QOL. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the clinical significance of our pilot study."
https://openalex.org/W2610816289,"The worldwide occurrence of complex climate-induced ecological shifts in marine systems is one of the major challenges in sustainable bio-resources management. The occurrence of ecological environment-driven shifts was studied in the Southern Caspian Sea using the ""shiftogram"" method on available fisheries-related (i.e. commercially important bentho-pelagic fish stocks) ecological and climatic variables. As indicators of potential environmentally driven shift patterns we used indices for the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Southern Oscillation, the Siberian High, the East Atlantic-West Russia pattern, as well as Sea Surface Temperature and surface chlorophyll-a concentration. Given the explorative findings from the serial shift analyses, the cascading and serial order of multiple shift events in climatic-ecologic conditions of the southern Caspian Sea suggested a linkage between external forces and dynamics of ecosystem components and structures in the following order: global-scale climate forces lead to local environmental processes, which in turn lead to biological components dynamics. For the first time, this study indicates that ecological shifts are an integral component of bentho-pelagic subsystem regulatory processes and dynamics. Qualitative correspondence of biological responses of bentho-pelagic stocks to climatic events is one of the supporting evidences that overall Caspian ecosystem structures and functioning might have-at least partially-been impacted by global-scale climatic or local environmental shifts. These findings may help to foster a regional Ecosystem-based Approach to Management (EAM) as an integral part of bentho-pelagic fisheries management plans."
https://openalex.org/W2610989831,"Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) instability is associated with human neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Recent studies have pointed out that DNA base excision repair (BER) mediated by DNA polymerase β (pol β) plays a crucial role in governing somatic TNR instability in a damage-location dependent manner. It has been shown that the activities and function of BER enzymes and cofactors can be modulated by their polymorphic variations. This could alter the function of BER in regulating TNR instability. However, the roles of BER polymorphism in modulating TNR instability remain to be elucidated. A previous study has shown that a pol β polymorphic variant, polβR137Q is associated with cancer due to its impaired polymerase activity and its deficiency in interacting with a BER cofactor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In this study, we have studied the effect of the pol βR137Q variant on TNR instability. We showed that pol βR137Q exhibited weak DNA synthesis activity to cause TNR deletion during BER. We demonstrated that similar to wild-type pol β, the weak DNA synthesis activity of pol βR137Q allowed it to skip over a small loop formed on the template strand, thereby facilitating TNR deletion during BER. Our results further suggest that carriers with pol βR137Q polymorphic variant may not exhibit an elevated risk of developing human diseases that are associated with TNR instability."
https://openalex.org/W2611948988,"LacZ is widely used as a reporter in studies of gene expression patterns. β-galactosidase, the product of LacZ gene, is usually detected by X-gal/FeCN staining. In X-gal/FeCN staining, β-galactosidase catalyzes X-gal to produce blue precipitates, which indicate the expression patterns of the gene of interest. A newer LacZ detection method using S-gal/TNBT is more sensitive but plagued by high background. Here, we describe an improved procedure that combines advantageous steps from the two methods. By comparing with X-gal/FeCN and S-gal/TNBT methods in detecting the expression patterns of miR-322/503 and miR-451 at a series of developmental stages, the improved method showed higher sensitivity and lower background. Thus, the improved method could be an alternative way of β-galactosidase staining in low gene expression situations."
https://openalex.org/W2611915499,"The cellulose binding domain (CBD) of cellulase binding to cellulosic materials is the initiation of a synergistic action on the enzymatic hydrolysis of the most abundant renewable biomass resources in nature. The binding of the CBD domain to cellulosic substrates generally relies on the interaction between the aromatic amino acids structurally located on the flat face of the CBD domain and the glucose rings of cellulose. In this study, we found the CBD domain of a newly cloned Penicillium crustosum endoglucanase EGL1, which was phylogenetically related to Aspergillus, Fusarium and Rhizopus, and divergent from the well-characterized Trichoderma reeseis cellulase CBD domain, contain two conserved aromatic amino acid-rich regions, Y451-Y452 and Y477-Y478-Y479, among which three amino acids Y451, Y477, and Y478 structurally sited on a flat face of this domain. Cellulose binding assays with green fluorescence protein as the marker, adsorption isotherm assays and an isothermal titration calorimetry assays revealed that although these three amino acids participated in this process, the Y451-Y452 appears to contribute more to the cellulose binding than Y477-Y478-Y479. Further glycine scanning mutagenesis and structural modelling revealed that the binding between CBD domain and cellulosic materials might be multi-amino-acids that participated in this process. The flexible poly-glucose molecule could contact Y451, Y477, and Y478 which form the contacting flat face of CBD domain as the typical model, some other amino acids in or outside the flat face might also participate in the interaction. Thus, it is possible that the conserved Y451-Y452 of CBD might have a higher chance of contacting the cellulosic substrates, contributing more to the affinity of CBD than the other amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2611682321,"The formation of immature lentiviral particles is dependent on the multimerization of the Gag polyprotein at the plasma membrane of the infected cells. One key player in the virus assembly process is the capsid (CA) domain of Gag, which establishes the protein-protein interactions that give rise to the hexagonal lattice of Gag molecules in the immature virion. To gain a better understanding of the functional equivalence between the CA proteins of simian and feline immunodeficiency viruses (SIV and FIV, respectively), we generated a series of chimeric FIV Gag proteins in which the CA-coding region was partially or totally replaced by its SIV counterpart. All the FIV Gag chimeras were found to be assembly-defective; however, all of them are able to interact with wild-type SIV Gag and be recruited into extracellular virus-like particles, regardless of the SIV CA sequences present in the chimeric FIV Gag. The results presented here markedly contrast with our previous findings showing that chimeric SIVs carrying FIV CA-derived sequences are assembly-competent. Overall, our data support the notion that although the SIV and FIV CA proteins share 51% amino acid sequence similarity and exhibit a similar organization, i.e., an N-terminal domain joined by a flexible linker to a C-terminal domain, their functional exchange between these different lentiviruses is strictly dependent on the context of the recipient Gag precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2611803947,"To develop a human metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) model in a rabbit liver.Immunosuppression in 4 adult New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.5 to 4.5 kg was induced with daily subcutaneous injection of 15 mg/kg Cyclosporine A (CsA). On day 3 open mini-laparotomy was performed and 0.2 ml (1.8x105 cells) suspension of HCT-116 and HT-29 human CRC cells were injected into the left and right medial lobe respectively. On day 10 the CsA dose was reduced to 10 mg/kg daily maintenance dose. Rabbits were weighed weekly, closely monitored for CsA side effects (weight loss, gingival hyperplasia and gut modification). Rabbits were sacrificed 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks after cells injection. Liver tumors were collected for histopathology and immunohistochemical analysis.HT-29 Tumor growth was observed in 3 rabbits (75%). Tumors measured 3, 4 and 6 mm after 5, 6 and 8 weeks respectively. Microscopically, tumors contained hyperchromatic, pleomorphic cells that stained for monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), polyclonal CEA, cytokeratin 20, vascular markers (CD31, CD34), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunohistochemistry, supporting involvement by the poorly differentiated HT-29 colorectal cancer cell line. No gross tumor growth or microscopic viability was observed from HCT-116 cell injection. CsA extra-hepatic manifestations included minimal gum hyperplasia and decrease in gut motility in 3 rabbits (75%), which was treated with Azithromycin 15 mg/kg and Cisapride 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, respectively.We successfully developed a human metastatic colon cancer model in immunosuppressed rabbit liver using HT-29 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2610343259,"The study of action selection in humans can present challenges of task design since our actions are usually defined by many degrees of freedom and therefore occupy a large action-space. While saccadic eye-movement offers a more constrained paradigm for investigating action selection, the study of reach-and-grasp in upper limbs has often been defined by more complex scenarios, not easily interpretable in terms of such selection. Here we present a novel motor behaviour task which addresses this by limiting the action space to a single degree of freedom in which subjects have to track (using a stylus) a vertical coloured target line displayed on a tablet computer, whilst ignoring a similarly oriented distractor line in a different colour. We ran this task with 55 subjects and showed that, in agreement with previous studies, the presence of the distractor generally increases the movement latency and directional error rate. Further, we used two distractor conditions according to whether the distractor’s location changes asynchronously or synchronously with the location of the target. We found that the asynchronous distractor yielded poorer performance than its synchronous counterpart, with significantly higher movement latencies and higher error rates. We interpret these results in an action selection framework with two actions (move left or right) and competing ‘action requests’ offered by the target and distractor. As such, the results provide insights into action selection performance in humans and supply data for directly constraining future computational models therein."
https://openalex.org/W2610956338,"When you need a Phillips head screw driver, you need a Phillips head screwdriver. You might try to press a flat head into service, but it will be largely ineffective. Tools in biology are no different. The right tool for the job can mean the difference between nailing a biological question or leaving a project in pieces. Chemical tools, in particular, provide ways to acutely probe biological processes. It’s difficult to imagine where the cytoskeleton field would be without nocodazole or latrunculin or how well we would understand mRNA transport without leptomycin B. Sadly, however, there’s no equivalent of a hardware store for biology, and the tool shelf (such as it is) is sparsely stocked. There are chemical libraries that can be sourced from national centers, commercial sources, or collaborators in industry and academia (see, for example, Jones and Bunnage, 2017Jones L.H. Bunnage M.E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2017; 16: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Screening them does yield hits, but the hits may or may not have the necessary specificity, selectivity, or properties to enable use in cells, live animals, or humans. The dilemma is how to pluck effective tools from within the ranks of available molecules or to engineer them. For many small molecules with phenotypic effects or impacts on specific pathways, the precise molecular targets aren’t known, or too many molecular targets have been implicated. New work from Jesse Gray and Michael Springer tackles the latter issue (Boswell et al., 2017Boswell S.A. Snavely A. Landry H.M. Churchman L.S. Gray J.M. Springer M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). What can you do when a small molecule shows potent effects in multiple screens aimed at finding inhibitors of dramatically different molecular processes? Is the molecule really promiscuous, or are the individual screens too coarse? Can further studies refine the answer? Gray and Springer’s study offers an approach to deconvolute the mechanisms of action for molecules targeting key steps in gene expression—a challenge because transcription, splicing, processing, and transport are interlinked. Using metrics based on analyses of single-strand sequencing data that can distinguish effects on distinct steps, a molecule, isoginkgetin (previously associated with inhibition of both splicing and RNA decay), was surprisingly shown to block transcription elongation. Other elongation inhibitors block CDK9 and control of pause release, but this one is different, and appears to act on a regulatory step later in the transcription process. Although isoginkgetin’s molecular target isn’t identified, these results point to a new and distinct control point for transcriptional elongation. That’s one shiny new addition to the toolkit for probing mechanisms of gene expression. Even when a protein target for a small molecule is well defined, it can be a challenge to ensure it interacts effectively and selectively in vivo—a measure of its ultimate utility. One approach is to capitalize on cellular identity, for example, by targeting a molecule to a cell surface protein that’s restricted to a subset of cells. A twist on that is to ectopically tether a molecule to specific cells, where it can interact with endogenous proteins. A recent paper from Michael Tadross and his colleagues focuses on bringing small-molecule inhibitors to the surface of neurons to test how inhibitors affect signaling in specific neuronal populations (Shields et al., 2017Shields B.C. Kahuno E. Kim C. Apostolides P.F. Brown J. Lindo S. Mensh B.D. Dudman J.T. Lavis L.D. Tadross M.R. Science. 2017; 356: eaaj2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The approach relies on expression of an optimized version of the HaloTag protein (Los et al., 2008Los G.V. Encell L.P. McDougall M.G. Hartzell D.D. Karassina N. Zimprich C. Wood M.G. Learish R. Ohana R.F. Urh M. et al.ACS Chem. Biol. 2008; 3: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar), a bacterial enzyme engineered to traffic to the cell surface where it interacts selectively with an exogenously supplied ligand. By fusing specific inhibitors to the HaloTag ligand, they become highly enriched on the cells of interest, while proximal cells that lack the expressed HaloTag experience a dramatically lower concentration of the inhibitor and do not respond to it. One application examines how dopamine receptor-expressing cells contribute to the motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. Impairing AMPAR glutamate receptor signaling in D2 cells of a PD mouse model selectively tempers motor control dysfunction in these mice, establishing dominance of these cells over D1 cells in the circuits controlling motor function. Rapid response is one benefit of this kind of pharmacology. In addition, the targeted proteins are endogenous (of necessity proximal to the ectopically expressed HaloTag) and can be cell-type specific in combination with other resources (e.g., specific Cre lines or precise geographical administration). Every DIY project demands a combination of the right tools and craftiness or inventive problem solving. Questions in biology are just like this. These recent papers showcase how using small-molecule tools can build mechanistic “know-how” around a biological process and, through crafty application, can control where and when molecules encounter their targets to yield answers at the organism scale."
