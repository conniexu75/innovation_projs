https://openalex.org/W2976567048,"The efficient interconversion of chemicals and electricity through electrocatalytic processes is central to many renewable-energy initiatives. The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)1-4 has long posed one of the biggest challenges in this field, and electrocatalysts based on expensive platinum-group metals are often required to improve the activity and durability of these reactions. The use of alloying5-7, surface strain8-11 and optimized coordination environments12 has resulted in platinum-based nanocrystals that enable very high ORR activities in acidic media; however, improving the activity of this reaction in alkaline environments remains challenging because of the difficulty in achieving optimized oxygen binding strength on platinum-group metals in the presence of hydroxide. Here we show that PdMo bimetallene-a palladium-molybdenum alloy in the form of a highly curved and sub-nanometre-thick metal nanosheet-is an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for the ORR and the OER in alkaline electrolytes, and shows promising performance as a cathode in Zn-air and Li-air batteries. The thin-sheet structure of PdMo bimetallene enables a large electrochemically active surface area (138.7 square metres per gram of palladium) as well as high atomic utilization, resulting in a mass activity towards the ORR of 16.37 amperes per milligram of palladium at 0.9 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline electrolytes. This mass activity is 78 times and 327 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts, respectively, and shows little decay after 30,000 potential cycles. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the alloying effect, the strain effect due to the curved geometry, and the quantum size effect due to the thinness of the sheets tune the electronic structure of the system for optimized oxygen binding. Given the properties and the structure-activity relationships of PdMo metallene, we suggest that other metallene materials could show great promise in energy electrocatalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2975042721,"Micronutrient deficiencies account for an estimated one million premature deaths annually, and for some nations can reduce gross domestic product1,2 by up to 11%, highlighting the need for food policies that focus on improving nutrition rather than simply increasing the volume of food produced3. People gain nutrients from a varied diet, although fish—which are a rich source of bioavailable micronutrients that are essential to human health4—are often overlooked. A lack of understanding of the nutrient composition of most fish5 and how nutrient yields vary among fisheries has hindered the policy shifts that are needed to effectively harness the potential of fisheries for food and nutrition security6. Here, using the concentration of 7 nutrients in more than 350 species of marine fish, we estimate how environmental and ecological traits predict nutrient content of marine finfish species. We use this predictive model to quantify the global spatial patterns of the concentrations of nutrients in marine fisheries and compare nutrient yields to the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in human populations. We find that species from tropical thermal regimes contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and zinc; smaller species contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and omega-3 fatty acids; and species from cold thermal regimes or those with a pelagic feeding pathway contain higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids. There is no relationship between nutrient concentrations and total fishery yield, highlighting that the nutrient quality of a fishery is determined by the species composition. For a number of countries in which nutrient intakes are inadequate, nutrients available in marine finfish catches exceed the dietary requirements for populations that live within 100 km of the coast, and a fraction of current landings could be particularly impactful for children under 5 years of age. Our analyses suggest that fish-based food strategies have the potential to substantially contribute to global food and nutrition security. Nutrient content analyses of marine finfish and current fisheries landings show that fish have the potential to substantially contribute to global food and nutrition security by alleviating micronutrient deficiencies in regions where they are prevalent."

https://openalex.org/W2976549303,"Organogenesis is a complex and interconnected process that is orchestrated by multiple boundary tissue interactions1–7. However, it remains unclear how individual, neighbouring components coordinate to establish an integral multi-organ structure. Here we report the continuous patterning and dynamic morphogenesis of hepatic, biliary and pancreatic structures, invaginating from a three-dimensional culture of human pluripotent stem cells. The boundary interactions between anterior and posterior gut spheroids differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells enables retinoic acid-dependent emergence of hepato-biliary-pancreatic organ domains specified at the foregut–midgut boundary organoids in the absence of extrinsic factors. Whereas transplant-derived tissues are dominated by midgut derivatives, long-term-cultured microdissected hepato-biliary-pancreatic organoids develop into segregated multi-organ anlages, which then recapitulate early morphogenetic events including the invagination and branching of three different and interconnected organ structures, reminiscent of tissues derived from mouse explanted foregut–midgut culture. Mis-segregation of multi-organ domains caused by a genetic mutation in HES1 abolishes the biliary specification potential in culture, as seen in vivo8,9. In sum, we demonstrate that the experimental multi-organ integrated model can be established by the juxtapositioning of foregut and midgut tissues, and potentially serves as a tractable, manipulatable and easily accessible model for the study of complex human endoderm organogenesis. Juxtaposition of region-specific gut spheroids derived from human pluripotent stem cells in the absence of extrinsic factors results in development of segregated hepato-biliary-pancreatic anlages that recapitulate early morphogenetic events."
https://openalex.org/W2976155788,"B cells are important in the pathogenesis of many, and perhaps all, immune-mediated diseases. Each B cell expresses a single B cell receptor (BCR)1, and the diverse range of BCRs expressed by the total B cell population of an individual is termed the 'BCR repertoire'. Our understanding of the BCR repertoire in the context of immune-mediated diseases is incomplete, and defining this could provide new insights into pathogenesis and therapy. Here, we compared the BCR repertoire in systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, Crohn's disease, Behçet's disease, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis by analysing BCR clonality, use of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) genes and-in particular-isotype use. An increase in clonality in systemic lupus erythematosus and Crohn's disease that was dominated by the IgA isotype, together with skewed use of the IGHV genes in these and other diseases, suggested a microbial contribution to pathogenesis. Different immunosuppressive treatments had specific and distinct effects on the repertoire; B cells that persisted after treatment with rituximab were predominately isotype-switched and clonally expanded, whereas the inverse was true for B cells that persisted after treatment with mycophenolate mofetil. Our comparative analysis of the BCR repertoire in immune-mediated disease reveals a complex B cell architecture, providing a platform for understanding pathological mechanisms and designing treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2976197226,"High-pressure transitions are thought to modify hydrogen molecules to a molecular metallic solid and finally to an atomic metal1, which is predicted to have exotic physical properties and the topology of a two-component (electron and proton) superconducting superfluid condensate2,3. Therefore, understanding such transitions remains an important objective in condensed matter physics4,5. However, measurements of the crystal structure of solid hydrogen, which provides crucial information about the metallization of hydrogen under compression, are lacking for most high-pressure phases, owing to the considerable technical challenges involved in X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements under extreme conditions. Here we present a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of solid hydrogen at pressures of up to 254 gigapascals that reveals the crystallographic nature of the transitions from phase I to phases III and IV. Under compression, hydrogen molecules remain in the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal lattice structure, accompanied by a monotonic increase in anisotropy. In addition, the pressure-dependent decrease of the unit cell volume exhibits a slope change when entering phase IV, suggesting a second-order isostructural phase transition. Our results indicate that the precursor to the exotic two-component atomic hydrogen may consist of electronic transitions caused by a highly distorted hcp Brillouin zone and molecular-symmetry breaking."
https://openalex.org/W2975910301,"Quantum information science has the potential to revolutionize modern technology by providing resource-efficient approaches to computing1, communication2 and sensing3. Although the physical qubits in a realistic quantum device will inevitably suffer errors, quantum error correction creates a path to fault-tolerant quantum information processing4. Quantum error correction, however, requires that individual qubits can interact with many other qubits in the processor. Engineering such high connectivity can pose a challenge for platforms such as electron spin qubits5, which naturally favour linear arrays. Here we present an experimental demonstration of the transmission of electron spin states via the Heisenberg exchange interaction in an array of spin qubits. Heisenberg exchange coupling-a direct manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents any two electrons with the same spin state from occupying the same orbital-tends to swap the spin states of neighbouring electrons. By precisely controlling the wavefunction overlap between electrons in a semiconductor quadruple quantum dot array, we generate a series of coherent SWAP operations to transfer both single-spin and entangled states back and forth in the array without moving any electrons. Because the process is scalable to large numbers of qubits, state transfer through Heisenberg exchange will be useful for multi-qubit gates and error correction in spin-based quantum computers."
https://openalex.org/W2976435545,"The widely accepted paradigm of Earth's geochemical evolution states that the successive extraction of melts from the mantle over the past 4.5 billion years formed the continental crust, and produced at least one complementary melt-depleted reservoir that is now recognized as the upper-mantle source of mid-ocean-ridge basalts1. However, geochemical modelling and the occurrence of high 3He/4He (that is, primordial) signatures in some volcanic rocks suggest that volumes of relatively undifferentiated mantle may reside in deeper, isolated regions2. Some basalts from large igneous provinces may provide temporally restricted glimpses of the most primitive parts of the mantle3,4, but key questions regarding the longevity of such sources on planetary timescales-and whether any survive today-remain unresolved. Kimberlites, small-volume volcanic rocks that are the source of most diamonds, offer rare insights into aspects of the composition of the Earth's deep mantle. The radiogenic isotope ratios of kimberlites of different ages enable us to map the evolution of this domain through time. Here we show that globally distributed kimberlites originate from a single homogeneous reservoir with an isotopic composition that is indicative of a uniform and pristine mantle source, which evolved in isolation over at least 2.5 billion years of Earth history-to our knowledge, the only such reservoir that has been identified to date. Around 200 million years ago, extensive volumes of the same source were perturbed, probably as a result of contamination by exogenic material. The distribution of affected kimberlites suggests that this event may be related to subduction along the margin of the Pangaea supercontinent. These results reveal a long-lived and globally extensive mantle reservoir that underwent subsequent disruption, possibly heralding a marked change to large-scale mantle-mixing regimes. These processes may explain why uncontaminated primordial mantle is so difficult to identify in recent mantle-derived melts."
https://openalex.org/W2976020194,"(+)-Perseanol is an isoryanodane diterpene that is isolated from the tropical shrub Persea indica1 and has potent antifeedant and insecticidal properties. It is structurally related to (+)-ryanodine, which is a high-affinity ligand for and modulator of ryanodine receptors—ligand-gated ion channels that are critical for intracellular Ca2+ signalling in most multicellular organisms2. Ryanodine itself modulates ryanodine-receptor-dependent Ca2+ release in many organisms, including mammals; however, preliminary data indicate that ryanodane and isoryanodane congeners that lack the pyrrole-2-carboxylate ester—such as perseanol—may have selective activity in insects3. Here we report a chemical synthesis of (+)-perseanol, which proceeds in 16 steps from commercially available (R)-pulegone. The synthesis involves a two-step annulation process that rapidly assembles the tetracyclic core from readily accessible cyclopentyl building blocks. This work demonstrates how convergent fragment coupling, when combined with strategic oxidation tactics, can enable the concise synthesis of complex and highly oxidized diterpene natural products. The chemical synthesis of (+)-perseanol, a diterpene with potent insecticidal properties, is reported."

https://openalex.org/W2976569613,"Research purpose and findings Coralline algae are key biological substrates of many carbonate systems globally. Their capacity to build enduring crusts that underpin the formation of tropical reefs, rhodolith beds and other benthic substrate is dependent on the formation of a calcified thallus. However, this important process of skeletal carbonate formation is not well understood. We undertook a study of cellular carbonate features to develop a model for calcification. We describe two types of cell wall calcification; 1) calcified primary cell wall (PCW) in the thin-walled elongate cells such as central medullary cells in articulated corallines and hypothallial cells in crustose coralline algae (CCA), 2) calcified secondary cell wall (SCW) with radial Mg-calcite crystals in thicker-walled rounded cortical cells of articulated corallines and perithallial cells of CCA. The distinctive banding found in many rhodoliths is the regular transition from PCW-only cells to SCW cells. Within the cell walls there can be bands of elevated Mg with Mg content of a few mol% higher than radial Mg-calcite (M-type), ranging up to dolomite composition (D-type). Model for calcification We propose the following three-step model for calcification. 1) A thin (< 0.5 μm) PCW forms and is filled with a mineralising fluid of organic compounds and seawater. Nanometer-scale Mg-calcite grains precipitate on the organic structures within the PCW. 2) Crystalline cellulose microfibrils (CMF) are extruded perpendicularly from the cellulose synthase complexes (CSC) in the plasmalemma to form the SCW. 3) The CMF soaks in the mineralising fluid as it extrudes and becomes calcified, retaining the perpendicular form, thus building the radial calcite. In Clathromorphum, SCW formation lags PCW creating a zone of weakness resulting in a split in the sub-surface crust. All calcification seems likely to be a bioinduced rather than controlled process. These findings are a substantial step forward in understanding how corallines calcify."
https://openalex.org/W2976586930,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant epithelial cancer of the head and neck with high prevalence in southern China, which is accompanied by notable invasiveness and metastasis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in the progression of various cancers including NPC. Microarray-based analysis identified highly expressed lncRNA mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 5 (SMAD5)-antisense RNA 1 (AS1) related to NPC. Interestingly, it is found that SMAD5-AS1 competitively bound to microRNA (miR)-106a-5p to regulate SMAD5. Herein, the study aimed to clarify the role of SMAD5-AS1/miR-106a-5p/SMAD5 axis in the process of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NPC. SMAD5-AS1 was highly expressed and miR-106a-5p was poorly expressed in NPC tissues and cell lines. The NPC cells were treated with a series of small interfering RNAs, mimics, or inhibitors to explore the effects of SMAD5-AS1, SMAD5, and miR-106a-5p on EMT, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC. Of note, SMAD5-AS1 silencing or miR-106a-5p overexpression reduced expression of N-cadherin, matrix metallopeptidase 9, Snail, and Vimentin while elevating E-cadherin expression, thus inhibiting EMT, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC by down-regulation of SMAD5. Moreover, SMAD5 silencing could reduce the ability of EMT induced by SMAD5-AS1 up-regulation. SMAD5-AS1 silencing or miR-106a-5p elevation inhibited tumorigenesis in nude mice. Taken together, SMAD5-AS1 silencing suppressed EMT, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC by elevating miR-106a-5p to down-regulate SMAD5, which provided a novel therapeutic target for NPC treatment.-Zheng, Y.-J., Zhao, J.-Y., Liang, T.-S., Wang, P., Wang, J., Yang, D.-K., Liu, Z.-S. Long noncoding RNA SMAD5-AS1 acts as a microRNA-106a-5p sponge to promote epithelial mesenchymal transition in nasopharyngeal carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2974970903,"The composition of the mammalian gut microbiota can be influenced by a multitude of environmental variables such as diet and infections. Studies investigating the effect of these variables on gut microbiota composition often sample across multiple separate populations and habitat types. In this study we explore how variation in the gut microbiota of the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) on the Isle of May, a small island off the east coast of Scotland, is associated with environmental and biological factors. Our study focuses on the effects of environmental variables, specifically trapping location and surrounding vegetation, as well as the host variables sex, age, body weight and endoparasite infection, on the gut microbiota composition across a fine spatial scale in a freely interbreeding population. We found that differences in gut microbiota composition were significantly associated with the trapping location of the host, even across this small spatial scale. Sex of the host showed a weak association with microbiota composition. Whilst sex and location could be identified as playing an important role in the compositional variation of the gut microbiota, 75% of the variation remains unexplained. Whereas other rodent studies have found associations between gut microbiota composition and age of the host or parasite infections, the present study could not clearly establish these associations. We conclude that fine spatial scales are important when considering gut microbiota composition and investigating differences among individuals."

https://openalex.org/W2976843161,"Data quality control is important for any data collection program, especially in citizen science projects, where it is more likely that errors occur due to the human factor. Ideally, data quality control in citizen science projects is also crowdsourced so that it can handle large amounts of data. Here we present the CrowdWater game as a gamified method to check crowdsourced water level class data that are submitted by citizen scientists through the CrowdWater app. The app uses a virtual staff gauge approach, which means that a digital scale is added to the first picture taken at a site and this scale is used for water level class observations at different times. In the game, participants classify water levels based on the comparison of the new picture with the picture containing the virtual staff gauge. By March 2019, 153 people had played the CrowdWater game and 841 pictures were classified. The average water level for the game votes for the classified pictures was compared to the water level class submitted through the app to determine whether the game can improve the quality of the data submitted through the app. For about 70% of the classified pictures, the water level class was the same for the CrowdWater app and game. For a quarter of the classified pictures, there was disagreement between the value submitted through the app and the average game vote. Expert judgement suggests that for three quarters of these cases, the game based average value was correct. The initial results indicate that the CrowdWater game helps to identify erroneous water level class observations from the CrowdWater app and provides a useful approach for crowdsourced data quality control. This study thus demonstrates the potential of gamified approaches for data quality control in citizen science projects."

https://openalex.org/W2976622502,"Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus, endemic in Central and West Africa. This viral zoonosis was introduced into the United States in 2003 via African rodents imported for the pet trade and caused 37 human cases, all linked to exposure to MPXV-infected black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Prairie dogs have since become a useful model of MPXV disease, utilized for testing of potential medical countermeasures. In this study, we used recombinant MPXV containing the firefly luciferase gene (luc) and in vivo imaging technology to characterize MPXV pathogenesis in the black-tailed prairie dog in real time. West African (WA) MPXV could be visualized using in vivo imaging in the nose, lymph nodes, intestines, heart, lung, kidneys, and liver as early as day 6 post infection (p.i.). By day 9 p.i., lesions became visible on the skin and in some cases in the spleen. After day 9 p.i., luminescent signal representing MPXV replication either increased, indicating a progression to what would be a fatal infection, or decreased as infection was resolved. Use of recombinant luc+ MPXV allowed for a greater understanding of how MPXV disseminates throughout the body in prairie dogs during the course of infection. This technology will be used to reduce the number of animals required in future pathogenesis studies as well as aid in determining the effectiveness of potential medical countermeasures."
https://openalex.org/W2975015014,"Pentosan polysulphate sodium (PPS) is a promising therapeutic agent for blocking knee pain in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). The mode of action of PPS in this context is unknown. We hypothesised that the osteocyte, being the principal cell type in the sub-chondral bone, was capable of expressing the pain mediator Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), and that this may be altered in the presence of PPS. We tested the expression of NGF and the response to PPS in the presence or absence of the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), in human osteocytes. For this we differentiated human primary osteoblasts grown from subchondral bone obtained at primary knee arthroplasty for KOA to an osteocyte-like stage over 28d. We also tested NGF expression in fresh osteocytes obtained by sequential digestion from KOA bone and by immunofluorescence in KOA bone sections. We demonstrate for the first time the production and secretion of NGF/proNGF by this cell type derived from patients with KOA, implicating osteocytes in the pain response in this pathological condition and possibly others. PPS inhibited TNFα-induced levels of proNGF secretion and TNFα induced NGF mRNA expression. Together, this provides evidence that PPS may act to suppress the release of NGF in the subchondral bone to ameliorate pain associated with knee osteoarthritis."

Based on our results from a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis, we attribute a substantial portion of the job satisfaction differences between China and the other countries to different job attributes and expectations; in particular, to unmet job expectations for interesting work, high pay, and opportunities for advancement. We also note that, contrary to common belief, Chinese workers value similar attributes as Western workers but perceive their work conditions as very different from those in the West."
https://openalex.org/W2977098632,"Humans evolved to be endurance animals. Our ancestors were persistence hunters; they would chase animals, including gazelles, until they ran them into exhaustion. Put simply, people evolved in an ecological niche that selected for endurance and efficiency of locomotion. To locomote to any destination, one could take countless different paths, each requiring different amounts of energy. Because the ground is typically not flat or homogeneous, the straight direct path is often not the most energetically efficient. For hills below 14°, the direct straight path up the hill is the most energetically efficient. However, for hills above 14°, walkers would minimize their absolute energy expenditure by taking a zigzagged path so that their gradient of ascension is 14° [1]. In three experiments, we assessed the degree to which people make bioenergetically efficient decisions about locomotion through path selection. In Experiment 1, people were immersed into a virtual environment and adjusted the angle of ascension of a virtual path up hills of various gradients so that when taking the path, they would expend the least amount of energy when they reached the top. The second experiment was of a similar design, but was conducted in the real word. In the last experiment, in a virtual environment, participants choose between two paths up hills of various gradient, where these paths varied in the energy required for ascent. Participants made these judgements both before and after motor experience with gradient climbing on an incline trainer. For steep hills, we found that people choose much straighter paths over the bioenergetically optimal zigzagged paths. Motor experience did lead to higher probability for choosing optimal paths for steep hills, but lead to less optimal paths for shallower ones. These results show clearly that individuals show a straight path bias when deciding how to ascend hills."
https://openalex.org/W2975268220,"Background Vitamin A and D deficiency is prevalent in pregnant women worldwide. Both vitamins are involved in fetal skeletal development. A positive association between maternal vitamin D levels and offspring bone mineral density (BMD) at adulthood has been observed. The impact of maternal vitamin A status in pregnancy on offspring peak bone mass remains unclear. Method and findings Forty-one mother-child pairs were recruited from a population-based prospective cohort study in Trondheim, Norway, where pregnant women were followed from gestational week 17. Their term-born infants were followed from birth (1986–88). Regression analyses were performed for vitamin A (retinol), 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] in maternal serum (gestational weeks 17, 33, 37) and cord blood. Offspring BMD and spine trabecular bone score (TBS), a measure of bone quality, were analyzed by dual x-ray absorptiometry at 26 years. Average levels during pregnancy of retinol, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D were 1.66 (0.32) μmol/L, 59.0 (20.6) nmol/L, and 251.3 (62.4) pmol/L, respectively. 1,25(OH)2D levels were similar in those with 25(OH)D levels <30 and >75 nmol/L. After adjustment for maternal age, BMI, smoking, and education, and offspring birth weight, maternal serum retinol was positively associated with offspring spine BMD [mean change 30.8 (CI 7.6, 54.0) mg/cm2 per 0.2 μmol/L retinol], and with offspring TBS, although non-significant (p = 0.08). No associations were found between maternal 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D levels and offspring bone parameters. Vitamin levels in cord blood were not associated with offspring BMD or TBS. Conclusions This is the first study to show an association between maternal vitamin A status and offspring peak bone mass. Our findings may imply increase future risk for osteoporotic fracture in offspring of mothers with suboptimal vitamin A level. No associations were observed between 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D and offspring BMD."
https://openalex.org/W2975561025,"The progression of cancer through local expansion and metastasis is well recognized, but preventing these characteristic cancer processes is challenging. To this end, a new strategy is required. In this study, we presented a novel dual functional podophyllotoxin derivative, 2-pyridinealdehyde hydrazone dithiocarbamate S-propionate podophyllotoxin ester (PtoxPdp), which inhibited both matrix metalloproteinases and Topoisomerase II. This new podophyllotoxin derivative exhibited significant anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic that correlated with the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase. In a xenograft animal local expansion model, PtoxPdp was superior to etoposide in tumor repression. A preliminary mechanistic study revealed that PtoxPdp induced apoptosis and autophagy via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, PtoxPdp could also inhibit epithelial–mesenchymal transition, which was achieved by downregulating both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and NF-κB/Snail pathways. Taken together, our results reveal that PtoxPdp is a promising antitumor drug candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2977075219,"The dismal prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is mainly due to its rapidly acquired resistance to all conventional treatments. Despite drug-specific mechanisms of resistance, none explains how these cells resist the stress induced by any kind of anticancer treatment. Activation of stress-response pathways relies on the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of involved proteins. Among all PTMs, those mediated by the ubiquitin family of proteins play a central role. Our aim was to identify alterations of ubiquitination, neddylation, and sumoylation associated with the multiresistant phenotype and demonstrate their implications in the survival of PDAC cells undergoing treatment. This approach pointed at an alteration of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein sumoylation associated with both gemcitabine and oxaliplatin resistance. We could show that this alteration of PML sumoylation is part of a general mechanism of drug resistance, which in addition involves the abnormal activation of NF-κB and cAMP response element binding pathways. Importantly, using patient-derived tumors and cell lines, we identified a correlation between the levels of PML expression and sumoylation and the sensitivity of tumors to anticancer treatments.-Swayden, M., Alzeeb, G., Masoud, R., Berthois, Y., Audebert, S., Camoin, L., Hannouche, L., Vachon, H., Gayet, O., Bigonnet, M., Roques, J., Silvy, F., Carrier, A., Dusetti, N., Iovanna, J.

https://openalex.org/W2977228452,"We hypothesized that postnatal development of the vagina is impacted by early nutritional environment. Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between postnatal gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h after birth, with or without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (>1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to one of four treatments: 1) suckled by sow (S, n = 8); 2) suckled by sow plus administration of a fat supplement (SF, n = 5); 3) bottle-fed solely milk replacer (B, n = 8); or 4) bottle-fed solely milk replacer plus administration of a fat supplement (BF, n = 7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs of gilts were taken with a cytology brush, and lipids were extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts, milk collected at 24 h from sows, and milk replacer were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids recovered from vaginal swabs that highly distinguished between S and B gilts [area-under-the-curve (AUC) > 0.9], including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbons and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE (34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r > 0.6; p < 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids with greater abundance in milk replacer drove association. For example, mean intensity of PE (34:4) was 149-fold higher in milk replacer than colostrum. Consequently, PE (34:4) was found to have 1.6- and 2.12-fold higher levels in serum and vaginal swab samples (p < 0.001), respectively, of B gilts as compared to S gilts. Findings support that vaginal swabs can be used to noninvasively study effects of perinatal nutrition on tissue composition."

Objective To assess the prescription of antibiotics for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) in primary care. Method An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study was conducted in 4 private not-for-profit outreach clinics located in slum areas in Nairobi, Kenya. Claims data of patients who received healthcare between April 1 and December 27, 2016 were collected in real-time through a mobile telephone-based healthcare data and payment exchange platform (branded as M-TIBA). These data were used to calculate the percentage of ARIs for which antibiotics were prescribed. In-depth interviews were conducted among 12 clinicians and 17 patients to explain the quantitative results. Results A total of 49,098 individuals were registered onto the platform, which allowed them to access healthcare at the study clinics through M-TIBA. For 36,210 clinic visits by 21,913 patients, 45,706 diagnoses and 85,484 medication prescriptions were recorded. ARIs were the most common diagnoses (17,739; 38.8%), and antibiotics were the most frequently prescribed medications (21,870; 25.6%). For 78.5% (95% CI: 77.9%, 79.1%) of ARI diagnoses, antibiotics were prescribed, most commonly amoxicillin (45%; 95% CI: 44.1%, 45.8%). These relatively high levels of prescription were explained by high patient load, clinician and patient perceptions that clinicians should prescribe, lack of access to laboratory tests, offloading near-expiry drugs, absence of policy and surveillance, and the use of treatment guidelines that are not up-to-date. Clinicians in contrast reported to strictly follow the Kenyan treatment guidelines. Conclusion This study showed successful quantification of antibiotic prescription and the prescribing pattern using real-world data collected through M-TIBA in private not-for-profit clinics in Nairobi."
https://openalex.org/W2975444316,"Accurate age estimation in wildlife conservation is an important diagnostic tool in the interpretation of biological data, necropsy examination, reproductive status and population demographics. The most frequently utilized methods to age bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) include tooth extraction; counting dental growth layer groups and dental radiography. These methods are inaccurate in dolphins > 13 years old, due to overlapping of the growth layer groups in dolphins and worn teeth. Establishing a non-invasive method of accurately aging bottlenose dolphins across the entire age range is important to long term conservation efforts to understand health status, lifespan, reproduction and survivability. A database of 126 radiographs from 94 dolphins of known chronological age was utilized to establish the stages of skeletal ossification over time. A numerical score from -1 to 8 was assigned to 16 anatomic locations on the pectoral radiograph, to create a formula to estimate age. The most informative areas to evaluate morphologically were the metaphyseal regions of the radius and ulna, and the proximal and distal epiphysis of metacarpals II and III. Third order polynomial regression calculated separate age predictor formulas for male and female dolphins, with females reaching sexual maturity earlier than males. Completion of epiphyseal closure of the long bones correlated with average sexual maturity. Managed care dolphin ages could be properly estimated with decreasing precision from within 3 months in animals < 5 years old, to within 5 years in animals > 30 years old. This diagnostic tool could also be applied to diagnose atypical ossification patterns consistent with nutritional, developmental or growth abnormalities, and identifying subclinical health issues. In conclusion, knowledge of the lifespan and the onset of sexual maturity for each species will allow this model to be applied to other cetaceans, facilitating age estimation via pectoral radiography in future research."
https://openalex.org/W2976003304,"Microcephaly and Zika Virus infection (ZIKV) were declared Public Health Emergencies of International Concern by the World Health Organization in 2016. Brazil was considered the epicenter of the outbreak. However, the occurrence of both ZIKV and microcephaly in Brazil was not evenly distributed across the country. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigate regional characteristics at the municipal level that can be associated with the incidence of microcephaly, our response variable, and its relationship with ZIKV and other predictors. All epidemiological data in this study was provided by the Ministry of Health official database (DATASUS). Microcephaly was only confirmed after birth and the diagnostic was made regardless of the mother’s ZIKV status. Using exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial autoregressive Tobit models, our results show that microcephaly incidence is significantly, at 95% confidence level, related not only to ZIKV, but also to access to primary care, population size, gross national product, mobility and environmental attributes of the municipalities. There is also a significant spatial autocorrelation of the dependent variable. The results indicate that municipalities that show a high incidence of microcephaly tend to be clustered in space and that incidence of microcephaly varies considerably across regions when correlated only with ZIKV, i.e. that ZIKV alone cannot explain the differences in microcephaly across regions and their correlation is mediated by regional attributes."

By investigating commonalities between these preventative approaches, we sought to identify possible targets for effective interventions. We compared the efficacy of EX and simvastatin (SV) pharmacotherapy to counteract cognitive deficits induced by a high‐cholesterol diet (2%, HCD) in mice overexpressing TGF‐β1 (TGF mice), a model of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Cognitive deficits were found in hypercholesterolemic mice for object recognition memory, and both SV and EX prevented this decline. EX improved stimulus‐evoked cerebral blood flow responses and was as effective as SV in normalizing endothelium‐dependent vasodilatory responses in cerebral arteries. The up‐regulation of galectin‐3‐positive microglial cells in white matter (WM) of HCD‐fed TGF mice with cognitive deficits was significantly reduced by both SV and EX concurrently with cognitive recovery. Altered hippocampal neurogenesis, gray matter astrogliosis, or microgliosis did not correlate with cognitive deficits or benefits. Overall, results indicate that SV and EX prevented cognitive decline in hypercholesterolemic mice and that they share common sites of action in preventing endothelial cell dysfunction and reducing WM inflammation.—Trigiani, L.

https://openalex.org/W2977172419,"After one previous caesarean section (CS), pregnant women can deliver by elective repeat CS or have a trial of labor which can end in a vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) or an unplanned CS. Despite guidelines describing women's rights to make an informed choice, trial of labor and VBAC rates vary greatly worldwide. Many women are inadequately informed due to caregivers' fear of an increase in CS rates in a high VBAC rate setting. We compared counseling with a decision aid (DA) including a prediction model on VBAC to care as usual. We hypothesize that counselling with the DA does not decrease VBAC rates. In addition, we aimed to study the effects on unplanned CS rate, patient involvement in decision-making and elective repeat CS rates.We performed a prospective cohort study. From 2012 to 2014, 483 women in six hospitals, where the DA was used (intervention group), were compared with 441 women in six matched hospitals (control group). Women with one previous CS, pregnant of a singleton in cephalic presentation, delivering after 37 weeks 0 days were eligible for inclusion.There was no significant difference in VBAC rates between the intervention (45%) and control group (46%) (adjusted odds ratio 0,92 (95% Confidence interval 0.69-1.23)). In the intervention group more women (42%) chose an elective repeat CS compared to the control group (31%) (adjusted odds ratio 1.6 (95% Confidence interval 1.18-2.17)). Of women choosing trial of labor, in the intervention group 77% delivered vaginally compared to 67% in the control group, resulting in an unplanned CS adjusted odds ratio of 0,57 (0.40-0.82) in the intervention group. In the intervention group, more women reported to be involved in decision-making (98% vs. 68%, P< 0.001).Implementing a decision aid with a prediction model for risk selection suggests unchanged VBAC rates, but 40% reduction in unplanned CS rates, increase in elective repeat CS and improved patient involvement in decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2975060306,"Organic materials in fresh-cut produce wash water deplete free chlorine that is required to prevent pathogen survival and cross-contamination. This research evaluated water quality parameters frequently used to describe organic load for their fitness to predict chlorine demand (CLD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), which are major needs identified by the industry-led produce food safety taskforce. Batches of romaine lettuce, iceberg lettuce, or carrot of different cut sizes and shapes were washed in 40 liters of water. Physicochemical properties of wash water including CLD, COD, total organic carbon (TOC), total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, total sugar content, and pH, were monitored. Results indicate that pH is primarily commodity dependent, while organic load is additionally impacted by cutting and washing conditions. Significant linear increases in COD, TOC, CLD, TDS, and turbidity resulted from increasing product-to-water ratio, and decreasing cut size. Physicochemical parameters, excluding pH, showed significant positive correlation across different cut sizes within a commodity. High correlations were obtained between CLD and COD and between COD and TOC for pooled products. The convenient measurement of TDS, along with its strong correlation with COD and CLD, suggests the potential of TDS for predicting organic load and chlorine reactivity. Finally, the potential application and limitation of the proposed models in practical produce processing procedures are discussed extensively."

To provide insights into the biology of this species, we examined its population genetic structure by obtaining 1.15-GB random genomic sequences using next-generation sequencing and developing genome-wide microsatellite markers. A total of 79,138 microsatellite loci were initially isolated from the genomic sequences; after strict selection and further testing of 40 primer pairs in eight individuals, 24 polymorphic microsatellites with high amplification rates were developed. These microsatellites were used to examine the population genetic structure of 96 individuals from four field populations collected across southern to northern China. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 13 with an average of 8.75; the observed and expected heterozygosity varied from 0.235 to 0.768 and from 0.333 to 0.785, respectively. Population genetic structure analysis showed weak genetic differentiation among the four geographical populations of E. corollae, suggesting a high rate of gene flow reflecting likely widespread migration of E. corollae in China."
https://openalex.org/W2977052481,"To prepare for an impending event of unknown temporal distribution, humans internally increase the perceived probability of event onset as time elapses. This effect is termed the hazard rate of events. We tested how the neural encoding of hazard rate changes by providing human participants with prior information on temporal event probability. We recorded behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data while participants listened to continuously repeating five-tone sequences, composed of four standard tones followed by a non-target deviant tone, delivered at slow (1.6 Hz) or fast (4 Hz) rates. The task was to detect a rare target tone, which equiprobably appeared at either position two, three or four of the repeating sequence. In this design, potential target position acts as a proxy for elapsed time. For participants uninformed about the target's distribution, elapsed time to uncertain target onset increased response speed, displaying a significant hazard rate effect at both slow and fast stimulus rates. However, only in fast sequences did prior information about the target's temporal distribution interact with elapsed time, suppressing the hazard rate. Importantly, in the fast, uninformed condition pre-stimulus power synchronization in the beta band (Beta 1, 15-19 Hz) predicted the hazard rate of response times. Prior information suppressed pre-stimulus power synchronization in the same band, while still significantly predicting response times. We conclude that Beta 1 power does not simply encode the hazard rate, but-more generally-internal estimates of temporal event probability based upon contextual information."

This study sought to establish the efficacy and accuracy of using 3D surface scanning to characterise spinal curvature and sagittal plane contour.10 healthy female adults with a mean age of 25 years, (standard deviation: 3.6 years) underwent both MRI and 3D surface scanning (3DSS) (Artec Eva, Artec Group Inc., Luxembourg) while lying in the lateral decubitus position on a rigid substrate. Prior to 3DSS, anatomical landmarks on the spinous processes of each participant were demarcated using stickers attached to the skin surface. Following 3DSS, oil capsules (fiducial markers) were overlaid on the stickers and the subject underwent MRI. MRI stacks were processed to measure the thoracolumbar spinous process locations, providing an anatomical reference. 3D coordinates for the markers (surface stickers and MRI oil capsules) and for the spinous processes mapped the spinal column profiles and were compared to assess the quality of fit between the 3DSS and MRI marker positions.The RMSE for the polynomials fit to the spinous process, fiducial and surface marker profiles ranged from 0.17-1.15mm for all subjects. The MRI fiducial marker location was well aligned with the spinous process profile in the thoracic and upper lumbar spine for nine of the subjects. Over the 10 subjects, the mean RMSE between the MRI and 3D scan sagittal profiles for all surface markers was 9.8mm (SD 4.2mm). Curvature was well matched for seven of the subjects, with two showing differing curvatures across the lumbar spine due to inconsistent subject positioning.Comparison of the observed trends for vertebral position measured from MRI and 3DSS, suggested the surface markers may provide a useful method for measuring internal changes in sagittal curvature or skeletal changes."
https://openalex.org/W2975856885,"The blood flow through the major vessels holds great diagnostic potential for the identification of cardiovascular complications and is therefore routinely assessed with current diagnostic modalities. Heart valves are subject to high hydrodynamic loads which render them prone to premature degradation. Failing native aortic valves are routinely replaced with bioprosthetic heart valves. This type of prosthesis is limited by a durability that is often less than the patient’s life expectancy. Frequent assessment of valvular function can therefore help to ensure good long-term outcomes and to plan reinterventions. In this article, we describe how unsupervised novelty detection algorithms can be used to automate the interpretation of blood flow data to improve outcomes through early detection of adverse cardiovascular events without requiring repeated check-ups in a clinical environment. The proposed method was tested in an in-vitro flow loop which allowed simulating a failing aortic valve in a laboratory setting. Aortic regurgitation of increasing severity was deliberately introduced with tube-shaped inserts, preventing complete valve closure during diastole. Blood flow recordings from a flow meter at the location of the ascending aorta were analyzed with the algorithms introduced in this article and a diagnostic index was defined that reflects the severity of valvular degradation. The results indicate that the proposed methodology offers a high sensitivity towards pathological changes of valvular function and that it is capable of automatically identifying valvular degradation. Such methods may be a step towards computer-assisted diagnostics and telemedicine that provide the clinician with novel tools to improve patient care."

It is generally accepted that use of the term ‘genetically modified’ causes controversy and conflict among consumers, but little is known about how using the term ‘biotechnology’ as a salient feature on product packaging affects consumer preferences. In an online discrete choice experiment consisting of two treatments, a set of 1005 randomly chosen Swedish consumers were surveyed about use of hormone and triploidization sterilization techniques for salmonids. The information given to the treatment group included an additional sentence stating that the triploidization technique is an application of biotechnology, while the control group received the same text but without reference to biotechnology. Analysis using a hierarchical Bayes approach revealed significant consumer reactions to the term biotechnology. When the term was included in information, variation in consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates increased significantly. Moreover, some participants were dissuaded towards an option guaranteeing no biotechnological intervention in production of fish. These results have multiple implications for research and for the food industry. For research, they indicate the importance of examining the distribution of variation in WTP estimates for more complete characterization of the effects of information on consumer behavior. For the food industry, they show that associating food with biotechnology creates more variability in demand. Initiatives should be introduced to reduce the confusion associated with the term biotechnology among consumers."

Methods We used a quasi-experimental one group post-test only design. The intervention implemented starting April 2014 comprised health-care worker training on quality assurance (QA) of HIV rapid testing and enrolment of the facilities in proficiency testing (PT), targeting 2,077 healthcare facilities in 32 high HIV burden districts. Following the intervention, two consecutive rounds of site assessments were undertaken. The first, conducted after a median of 7.5 months following the training, included 1,915 facilities that participated in the QA training, while the second, conducted after a median of one-year following the first-round assessment included 517 (27.0%) of the 1,915 facilities. In both assessments, the Stepwise-Process-for-Improving-the-quality-of-HIV-Rapid-Testing (SPI-RT) checklist was used to score facilities’ performance in 7 domains: training, physical facility, safety, pre-testing, testing, post-testing and external quality assessment. Facilities’ level of readiness for national certification was assessed. Result Between 2016 and 2017, there were four PT cycles. PT participation increased from 32.4% (620/1,915) in 2016 to 91.5% (1,753/1,915) in 2017. In each PT cycle, PT results were returned by 76%–87% of facilities and a satisfactory result (>80%) was achieved by ≥95% of facilities. In the SPI-RT assessment, in round-one, 22.3% of facilities were close to or eligible for national certification—this significantly increased to 38.8% in round-two (P-value<0.001). The median SPI-RT score for the domains HIV pre-testing (83.3%) and post-testing (72.2%) remained the same between the two rounds. The median score for the testing domain increased by 5.6% (to 77.8%). Conclusion Facilities performance on the domains that are critical for accuracy of diagnosis (i.e. pre-testing, testing and post-testing) remained largely unchanged. This study provided several recommendations to improve QA implementation in South Africa, including the need to improve routine use of internal quality control for corrective actions."
https://openalex.org/W2975816844,"Accurate prognostic evaluation is a key factor in the clinical management of patients affected by severe acute brain injury (ABI) and helps planning focused therapies, better caregiver's support and allocation of resources. Aim of the study was to assess factors independently associated with both the short and long-term outcomes after rehabilitation in patients affected by ABI in the setting of a single Rehabilitation Unit specifically allocated to these patients.In all patients (567) with age ≥ 18 years discharged from the Unit in the period 2006/2015 demographic, etiologic, comorbidity indicators, and descriptors of the disability burden (at hospital admission and discharge) were evaluated as potential prognostic factors of both short-term (4 classes of disability status at discharge) and long-term (mortality) outcomes. A comprehensive analytical method was adopted to combine several tasks. Select the factors with a significant independent association with the outcome, assess the relative weights and the ""stability"" (by bootstrap resampling) of them and estimate the role of the prognostic models in the clinical framework considering ""cost"" and ""benefits"". The generalized ordered logistic model for ordinal dependent variables was used for the short-term outcome while the Cox proportional hazard model was used for the long-term outcome. The final short-term model identified 7 factors that independently account for 37% of the outcome variability as shown by pseudo R2 (pR2) = 0.37. The disability status descriptors show the strongest association since they account for more than 60% of the pR2, followed by age (14.8%), the presence of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or nasogastric intubation (14.4%), a longer stay in the acute ward (5.9%) and concomitant coronary disease (1.3%). The final multivariable Cox model identified 4 factors that independently account for 52% of the outcome variability (R2 = 0.52). The disability extent and the disability recovered lead the long-term mortality since they account for the 53% of the global R2. The relevant effect of age (42%) is appreciable only after 2 years given the significant interaction with time. A longer stay in the acute ward explains the remaining fraction (5%). Considering 'cost and benefits', the decision curve analysis shows that the clinical benefit achieved by using both prognostic models is greater than the other possible action strategies, namely 'treat all' and 'treat none. Several less obvious characteristics of the prognostic models are appreciated by integrating the results of multiple analytical methods.The comprehensive analytical tool aimed to integrate statistical significance, weight, ""stability"" and clinical ""net"" benefit, gives back a prognostic framework explaining a relevant portion of both outcomes' variability in which the strong association of the disability status with both outcomes is comparable to and followed by a time modulated role of age. Our data do not support a differentiated association of traumatic vs non-traumatic etiology. The results encourage the use of integrated approach to analyze cohort data."
https://openalex.org/W2976300387,"Introduction Preeclampsia is a medical condition complicated with hypertension and proteinuria during pregnancy. While preeclampsia affects approximately 5% of pregnancies, it remains without a cure. In addition, women who had preeclampsia during pregnancy have been reported to have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease later in life. However, the disease etiology and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The paucity in the literature on preeclampsia associated maternal cardiovascular risk in different ethnic populations also present a need for more research. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify cardiovascular/metabolic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes, and regulatory pathways associated with early-onset preeclampsia. Materials and methods We compared maternal DNAs from 31 women with early-onset preeclampsia with those from a control group of 29 women without preeclampsia who delivered full-term normal birthweight infants. Women with multiple gestations and/or known medical disorders associated with preeclampsia (pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, renal disease, hyperthyroidism, and lupus) were excluded. The MetaboChip genotyping array with approximately 197,000 SNPs associated with metabolic and cardiovascular traits was used. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis was performed using the SNPAssoc program in R. The Truncated Product Method was used to identify significantly associated genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Ingenuity Causal Network Analysis were used to identify significantly associated disease processes and regulatory gene networks respectively. Results The early-onset preeclampsia group included 45% Filipino, 26% White, 16% other Asian, and 13% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders, which did not differ from the control group. There were no SNPs associated with early-onset preeclampsia after correction for multiple comparisons. However, through gene-based tests, 68 genes and 23 cardiovascular disease-related processes were found to be significantly associated. Associated gene regulatory networks involved cellular movement, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory disease. Conclusions Multiple cardiovascular genes and diseases demonstrate associations with early-onset preeclampsia. This unfolds new areas of research regarding the genetic determinants of early-onset preeclampsia and their relation to future cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2976881600,"The benefits and efficacy of control programs for herds infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) have been investigated under various contexts. However, most previous research investigated paratuberculosis control programs in isolation, without modeling the potential association with other dairy diseases. This paper evaluated the benefits of MAP control programs when the herd is also affected by mastitis, a common disease causing the largest losses in dairy production. The effect of typically suggested MAP controls were estimated under the assumption that MAP infection increased the rate of clinical mastitis. We evaluated one hundred twenty three control strategies comprising various combinations of testing, culling, and hygiene, and found that the association of paratuberculosis with mastitis alters the ranking of specific MAP control programs, but only slightly alters the cost-benefit difference of particular MAP control components, as measured by the distribution of net present value of a representative U.S. dairy operation. In particular, although testing and culling for MAP resulted in a reduction in MAP incidence, that control led to lower net present value (NPV) per cow. When testing was used, ELISA was more economically beneficial than alternative testing regimes, especially if mastitis was explicitly modeled as more likely in MAP-infected animals, but ELISA testing was only significantly associated with higher NPV if mastitis was not included in the model at all. Additional hygiene was associated with a lower NPV per cow, although it lowered MAP prevalence. Overall, the addition of an increased risk of mastitis in MAP-infected animals did not change model recommendations as much as failing to consider."

Overexpression of LMX1A inhibits tumor growth. However, the mechanisms remains unclear. Considering LMX1A as a transcription factor, a comparison of RNA-seq between gastric cancer cells (GCCs) and GCCs with LMX1A overexpressed was performed to identify genes transcriptionally activated by LMX1A. Among the potential LMX1A target genes, angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) has been reported to be an important tumor suppressor and thus was selected for further validation and research. Both LMX1A and ANGPTL4 showed downregulated expression in gastric cancer samples. More importantly, the expression of LMX1A is positively correlated with ANGPTL4, without including other family members in gastric cancer cell lines. What’s more, knockdown of ANGPTL4 rescued the tumor suppressive phenotype of LMX1A overexpression, which indicated that LMX1A upregulates ANGPTL4 to exert its role. Mechanistically, we found that LMX1A inhibited the expression of the oncogene C-Myc, which is alleviated by ANGPTL4 knockdown. In general, our results showed that LMX1A exerts its tumor suppressive role by activating ANGPTL4 to inhibit C-Myc."

Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), 25(OH)D, hs-CRP, vitamin-D binding protein (VDBP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were determined using ELISA and rheumatoid factor (RF) seropositivity was determined by nephelometry.We demonstrate that 25 (OH) D concentrations were lower in winter than summer (P = 0.0538), and that serum 25(OH)D levels were higher in samples collected and stored after 2013 (P<0.0001). Analysis of samples obtained after 2013 demonstrated that 37.6% of study participants were 25(OH)D insufficient (<75nmol/L). Also, seropositive RA patients and FDR had lower 25(OH)D levels compared to ACPA-/FDR (P<0.05, P<0.01 respectively). Linear regression analysis showed 25(OH)D insufficiency was inversely associated with presence of RA autoantibodies. Longitudinal samples from 14 progressors demonstrated a consistent increase in 25(OH)D levels at the time they exhibited clinically detectable joint inflammation, without any significant change in VDBP or PTH levels. Spearman rank correlation analysis showed significant association between 25(OH)D and PTH levels, both in RA patients and progressors at RA onset time.We demonstrate that 25(OH)D levels in serum increased at RA onset in progressors. The potential role that vitamin D metabolites and their downstream effects play in RA transition requires further investigation."

Adjusting planting density is one of the most effective measures for maximizing cotton yield under certain climatic conditions. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the optimum planting density and the corresponding leaf area index (LAI) and yield under the climatic conditions of Henan Province, China, and (2) to learn how climatic conditions influence cotton growth, yield, and yield components. A three-year (2013-2015) field experiment was conducted in Anyang, Henan Province, using cultivar SCRC28 across six planting density treatments: 15,000, 33,000, 51,000, 69,000, 87,000, and 105,000 plants ha-1. The data showed that the yield attributes, including seed cotton yield, lint yield, dry matter accumulation, and the LAI, increased as planting density increased. Consequently, the treatment of the maximum density with 105,000 plants ha-1 was the highest-yielding over three years, with the LAIs averaged across the three years being 0.37 at the bud stage, 2.36 at the flower and boll-forming stage, and 1.37 at the boll-opening stage. Furthermore, the correlation between the cotton yield attributes and meteorological conditions indicated that light interception (LI) and the diurnal temperature range were the climatic factors that most strongly influenced cotton seed yield. Moreover, the influence of the number of growing degree days (GDD) on cotton was different at different growth stages. These observations will be useful for determining best management practices for cotton production under the climatic conditions of Henan Province, China."

These organizations have been usually depicted as 'feminised environments' although women in managerial positions are still underrepresented. Based on different theoretical approaches, we separately investigate the relationship between a greater female presence and school performance in three positions: a) as principal; b) on the management team; and c) as teachers. We also investigate if having a female leader exerts a significant mediator role on the relationship between greater female representation on the management team and teachers, respectively, and school performance. Our results reveal a positive and significant relationship between having a woman principal or a greater proportion of women teachers and school performance. However, the relationship between a high proportion of women on the management team and school performance is negative. We also find that a female principal does not play a significant role as mediator in the relationship between having a greater proportion of women on the management team and as teachers and school performance."
