https://openalex.org/W3047091198,"A vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is needed to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Structural studies have led to the development of mutations that stabilize Betacoronavirus spike proteins in the prefusion state, improving their expression and increasing immunogenicity1. This principle has been applied to design mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is stabilized in the prefusion conformation. Here we show that mRNA-1273 induces potent neutralizing antibody responses to both wild-type (D614) and D614G mutant2 SARS-CoV-2 as well as CD8+ T cell responses, and protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs and noses of mice without evidence of immunopathology. mRNA-1273 is currently in a phase III trial to evaluate its efficacy. mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine that encodes a stabilized prefusion-state severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, elicits robust immune responses and protects mice against replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper and lower airways."

Several studies have reported that some people who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 have preexisting reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The immunological mechanisms underlying this preexisting reactivity are not clear, but previous exposure to widely circulating common cold coronaviruses might be involved. Mateus et al. found that the preexisting reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 comes from memory T cells and that cross-reactive T cells can specifically recognize a SARS-CoV-2 epitope as well as the homologous epitope from a common cold coronavirus. These findings underline the importance of determining the impacts of preexisting immune memory in COVID-19 disease severity. Science , this issue p. 89"

A soluble version of the receptor is being explored as a therapeutic. Chan et al. used deep mutagenesis to identify ACE2 mutants that bind more tightly to the spike protein and combined mutations to further increase binding affinity (see the Perspective by DeKosky). A promising variant was engineered to be a stable dimer that has a binding affinity for the spike protein; it is comparable with neutralizing antibodies and neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in a cell-based assay. In addition, the similarity to the natural receptor may limit the possibility for viral escape. Science , this issue p. 1261 ; see also p. 1167"

Maintenance of tissue homeostasis and repair following injury relies on the function of adult stem cells (Hogan et al., 2014Hogan B.L. Barkauskas C.E. Chapman H.A. Epstein J.A. Jain R. Hsia C.C.

In the lungs, barrier integrity of the epithelium is essential for protection against infection and efficient gas exchange. Lung tissue has slow cell turnover at steady state but harbors region-specific stem cells that quickly mobilize after tissue injury to replenish the epithelium (Hogan et al., 2014Hogan B.L. Barkauskas C.E. Chapman H.A. Epstein J.A. Jain R. Hsia C.C. Niklason L. Calle E. Le A.

In the alveoli, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells maintain lung homeostasis and enable regeneration after injury by proliferating and differentiating into new alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells specialized for gas exchange (Adamson and Bowden, 1974Adamson I.Y.

Given the importance of AT2 cells, their self-renewal and differentiation must be tightly coordinated to maintain tissue integrity and efficient repair. Disruption of this balance can lead to life-threatening lung diseases (Hogan et al., 2014Hogan B.L. Barkauskas C.E. Chapman H.A. Epstein J.A. Jain R. Hsia C.C. Niklason L. Calle E. Le A.

Recent studies have begun to suggest signaling pathways involved in regulation of proliferation and differentiation of AT2 cells (Finn et al., 2019Finn J. Sottoriva K. Pajcini K.V. Kitajewski J.K.

Single cell RNA sequencing identifies TGFβ as a key regenerative cue following LPS-induced lung injury.JCI Insight. 2019; 5: e123637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear which factors driven by injury trigger activation of quiescent AT2 cells to differentiate toward the AT1 cell fate and which differentiation trajectory they follow during lung regeneration. Tissue repair is a complex process that involves dynamic crosstalk between stem cells and their respective niches. Physiological insults, such as a viral infection, are well known to instigate inflammation by triggering activation or recruitment of immune cells to the affected tissue site (Medzhitov, 2008Medzhitov R. Origin and physiological roles of inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3153) Google Scholar). In solid tissues, diverse immune cells of innate or adaptive immunity are even integral components of the niche, where they contribute to immune defense against infection and can sense environmental stimuli (Naik et al., 2018Naik S.

Beyond the ability to clear pathogens, recent studies highlight how restoration of barrier integrity in epithelial organs such as the skin, gut, and lung after destruction is critically dependent on the immune system (Hsu et al., 2014Hsu Y.C.

Lung epithelium is especially vulnerable to injury because its surface is exposed to the external environment. In line with this, immune cells have been reported to be involved in lung homeostasis and restoration (Chen et al., 2012Chen F. Liu Z. Wu W. Rozo C. Bowdridge S. Millman A. Van Rooijen N.

Recent advances have increased our insight into the critical role of paracrine niche-generated signals as key modulators of stem cell behaviors. In the distal lung, Pdgfra+ mesenchymal cells and vascular endothelial cells have been identified as supportive niche cells (Barkauskas et al., 2013Barkauskas C.E. Cronce M.J. Rackley C.R. Bowie E.J. Keene D.R. Stripp B.R. Randell S.H. Noble P.W. Hogan B.L. Type 2 alveolar cells are stem cells in adult lung.J. Clin.

More recently, mesenchymal cell subtypes, including Wnt-responding and Wnt-producing fibroblasts, have been suggested to regulate stem cell properties and the cellular identity of AT2 cells (Lee et al., 2017Lee J.H.

However, our knowledge regarding the specific crosstalk between inflammatory cells and AT2 cells in regeneration remains limited. In particular, a fundamental question still to be investigated is how chronic inflammation affects tissue destruction because it is likely caused by impaired stem cell function or regeneration process after injury, processes that are poorly understood. Here we set out to identify the lineage trajectory from AT2 toward AT1 cells during alveolar regeneration after injury. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of in vivo AT2 lineage-labeled cells and ex vivo AT2 cell-derived organoids allowed us to delineate a precise differentiation trajectory in which AT2 cells adopt a “priming” state followed by transition into damage-associated transition progenitors (DATPs) prior to conversion into terminally differentiated AT1 cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that inflammatory niches driven by IL-1β and Hif1α signaling pathways orchestrate the regeneration process by triggering state-specific differentiation programs of AT2-lineage cells. Overall, our study reveals essential functions of inflammation in alveolar regeneration, providing new insights into how chronic inflammation impairs tissue restoration and leads to lung diseases. To define molecular identities and states of AT2-lineage cells responding to injury and undergoing regeneration, we treated AT2 reporter mice (SPC-CreERT2;R26RtdTomato) with tamoxifen, exposed them to PBS (control, homeostasis) or bleomycin (injury), and isolated lineage-labeled cells for scRNA-seq analysis on day 14 (acute injury) or 28 (resolution of injury) (Figure 1A; Figure S1A). Based on the expression of canonical AT1 and AT2 cell markers, we uncovered five distinct cell populations (Figure 1B; Figure S1B). Distribution of each cluster across time points allowed us to assess how AT2 cells changed during injury response and repair (Figure 1C). As expected, lineage-labeled cells in uninjured mice comprised mainly AT2 cells (cluster 1) expressing canonical AT2 markers, such as surfactant proteins (Sftpc and Sftpa1) (Figures 1C and 1D). On day 14 after injury, three additional distinct populations had emerged, whereas this AT2 cluster had become dramatically reduced (Figures 1C and 1D). Approximately 6% of lineage-labeled cells expressed cell cycle markers such as Cdk1, Mki67, and Cenpa, corresponding to cycling AT2 (cAT2) cells (cluster 3) (Figure 1D; Figure S1C). A second AT2-like state was highly prominent at this stage (cluster 2). This cluster showed similar expression levels of canonical AT2 markers, including Sftpc, but lower expression of genes that are involved in the lipid metabolism shown in homeostatic AT2 (hAT2) cells (cluster 1), such as Acly, Hmgcr, and Hmgcs1 (Figure 1D; Figure S1C). We also found enriched expression of genes induced by an inflammatory response, such as Ptges, Lcn1, Orm1, Tmem173, and Ifitm2/3, in this cluster (Figure 1D; Figure S1C; Fortier et al., 2008Fortier M.A. Krishnaswamy K.

Remarkably, essential regulators for AT2 lineage specification, such as Etv5, Abca3, and Cebpa, were also downregulated, suggesting that this population had lost AT2 identity (Figure 1D; Figure S1C; Martis et al., 2006Martis P.C.

USA. 2017; 114: 3903-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting a primed AT2 (pAT2) state. In addition, cluster 2 cells had a transcriptional signature similar to that of cAT2 cells, with the exception of cell cycle-related genes. We also identified an uncharacterized cellular subset of cluster 4, which we named damage-associated transition progenitors (DATPs). DATPs expressed specific markers such as Cldn4, Krt8, Ndrg1, Sprr1a, and AW112010 (Figure 1D; Figure S1C). Overall, DATPs shared features of the AT1-lineage transcription signature but showed much lower expression of canonical AT1 markers, including Pdpn, Hopx, and Cav-1 (Figure 1D; Figure S1C). Analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms further revealed that DATPs were characterized by increased expression of genes associated with p53 signaling (e.g., Trp53, Mdm2, Ccnd1, and Gdf15), inhibition of proliferation (e.g., Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a), hypoxia (Hif1a and Ndrg1), and the interferon-gamma signaling pathway (e.g., Ifngr1, Ly6a/Sca-1, Irf7, and Cxcl16) (Figure S1D). As expected, on day 28 post-injury, we observed substantial increases in the mature AT1 and hAT2 populations, whereas cAT2, pAT2, and DATPs were diminished, reflecting return to alveolar homeostasis after injury (Figure 1C). To better understand the differentiation paths of AT2 cells to AT1 cells during regeneration, we applied partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA; Figure 1E) and characterized transcriptional programs ordered along pseudotemporal trajectories (Figure 1F; Wolf et al., 2019Wolf F.A. Hamey F.K. Plass M. Solana J. Dahlin J.S. Göttgens B. Rajewsky N. Simon L. Theis F.J. PAGA: graph abstraction reconciles clustering with trajectory inference through a topology preserving map of single cells.Genome Biol. 2019; 20: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PAGA shows that AT2 and AT1 cells are connected via a trajectory that includes pAT2 cells and DATPs (Figure 1E). cAT2 cells were assigned as the population closest to pAT2 cells, suggesting that priming of naive AT2 cells prior to initiation of differentiation is closely related to a cell cycle event. After excluding cAT2 cells, pseudotime analysis showed that AT2 transitions into AT1 cells via pAT2 cells and DATPs, similar to that what we observed in PAGA (Figure 1F; Haghverdi et al., 2016Haghverdi L. Büttner M. Wolf F.A. Buettner F. Theis F.J. Diffusion pseudotime robustly reconstructs lineage branching.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings reveal a differentiation trajectory of AT2 cells toward AT1 cell fate acquisition that passes through distinct pAT2 and DATP cell states during regeneration. Given our data showing increased expression of genes associated with the immune response signatures in pAT2 cells, we next asked whether bleomycin injury resulted in inflammation (Figure S2A). By flow cytometry analysis, we found dynamic changes in macrophage behavior across injury response and regeneration. On day 7 after injury, the number and frequency of interstitial macrophages (IMs) were increased significantly, whereas the number and frequency of alveolar macrophages (AMs) were decreased (Figures S2B–S2D). These changes were restored to homeostatic levels at day 28, indicating resolution of acute inflammation. Because macrophages localized near AT2 lineage-labeled cells during acute injury (Figure S2E), we hypothesized that macrophages may affect the behavior of lineage-labeled cells in response to injury. Importantly, 3D organoid co-cultures in which AT2 cells were cultured together with IMs in the presence of stromal cells revealed more and larger organoid formation than when they were co-cultured with AMs (Figures 2A–2C; Lee et al., 2014Lee J.H. Bhang D.H. Beede A. Huang T.L. Stripp B.R. Bloch K.D. Wagers A.J. Tseng Y.H. Ryeom S. Kim C.F.

To further address the contribution of macrophages in alveolar regeneration after injury, we analyzed scRNA-seq of non-lineage-labeled cells from SPC-CreERT2;R26RtdTomato mice, including immune cells, isolated in parallel with samples (PBS, day 14 and day 28 in Figure 1; Figures S2F–S2H). The expression level of IL-1β, which is specifically detected in macrophages, was increased on day 14 after injury and decreased to homeostatic levels on day 28 (Figures S2H and S2I). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis on isolated AMs and IMs from uninjured lungs revealed that IL-1β is highly and specifically expressed in IMs, whereas IL-18 is enriched in AMs, consistent with previous reports (Figure S2J; Misharin et al., 2017Misharin A.V. Morales-Nebreda L. Reyfman P.A. Cuda C.M. Walter J.M. McQuattie-Pimentel A.C. Chen C.I. Anekalla K.R. Joshi N. Williams K.J.N. et al.Monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages drive lung fibrosis and persist in the lung over the life span.J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214: 2387-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) activation specifically augmented IL-1β expression in IMs but did not affect IL-18 expression in AMs (Figure S2J). Notably, bleomycin injury stimulated IL-1β expression in IMs in vivo (Figure S2K). IL-1β treatment was also sufficient to increase the number and size of organoids formed by AT2 cells (Figures 2D and 2E). To find out how IL-1β affects the cellular and molecular behavior of AT2 cells, we performed scRNA-seq of control and IL-1β-treated organoids. Based on marker gene expression, we identified five distinctive clusters (AT2, pAT2, cAT2, DATPs, and AT1 cells) similar to those we had seen in AT2 lineage-labeled cells (Figure 2F; Figures S3A–S3C). In control organoids, most cell types corresponded to AT2 and AT1 cells along with smaller pAT2 and DATPs clusters (Figure 2G). In contrast, IL-1β treatment increased the pAT2 fraction to ∼77%, classified by low expression of genes such as Etv5, Abca3, and Cebpa, suggesting that IL-1β triggers AT2 cells to enter a primed state (Figure 2G). The DATP population was also increased by IL-1β treatment (Figure 2G). Pseudotime and PAGA analysis of the scRNA-seq data showed that IL-1β-treated organoids skew differentiation of AT2 cells toward the AT1 fate (Figure 2H; Figure S3D) by enhancing differentiation into pAT2 and DATP states similar to those of regenerating AT2 cells in vivo (Figures S3E and S3F). To investigate whether IL-1β directly influences AT2 cell fate transitions, we examined cellular states on days 6 and 14, two key differentiation time points across organoid formation. On day 6, qPCR analysis of IL-1β-treated organoids showed an enriched transcriptional signature of pAT2-state relative to control organoids (Figure 2I). In addition, day 14 immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis of DATP markers, such as Krt8 and Cldn4, confirmed that DATPs were increased significantly in IL-1β-treated organoids (Figures 2J and 2K). These data show that IL-1β treatment in AT2 organoids recapitulates key aspects of in vivo lung regeneration. Taken together, our data demonstrate that an IL-1β-mediated inflammatory niche triggers AT2-mediated injury response during alveolar regeneration via differentiation programs to generate DATPs. Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed the previously unknown AT2 lineage-derived DATP population emerging during alveolar regeneration and in organoids stimulated with IL-1β. Using AT2 reporter mice (SPC-CreERT2;R26RtdTomato), we found that approximately 10% of AT2 lineage-labeled cells express Krt8 on 14 days after bleomycin injury, confirming that DATPs originate directly from AT2 cells (Figures 3A–3C). Importantly, neither the AT2 marker SPC nor the AT1 marker podoplanin (Pdpn) were detected in this population (Figures 3B and 3D). To further assess functional contributions of DATPs to alveolar regeneration, we established lineage reporter mice for N-Myc downstream-regulated 1 (Ndrg1), which is uniquely expressed in DATPs during alveolar regeneration (Ndrg1-CreERT2;R26RtdTomato) (Figures 1D and 3E). We did not detect any expression of Ndrg1 in airway epithelial cells with or without injury (Figure 3F). Consistent with our scRNA-seq data, neither AT2 and AT1 cells were labeled by Ndrg1 expression in PBS control mice (Figure 3G). However, on 9 days after bleomycin injury, Ndrg1 lineage-labeled cells emerged with a majority of cells positive for Krt8 in the alveolar region (Figures 3H and 3I). On day 28, we found that approximately 30% of AT1 cells were lineage-labeled by Ndrg1 with AT1 cell morphology (Figures 3J and 3K). We also confirmed the contribution of DATPs in AT1 cell generation with lineage-tracing analysis using Krt8 reporter mice (Krt8-CreERT2;R26RtdTomato) (Figure S4A). Consistent with Ndrg1 lineage-labeled cells, neither AT2 nor AT1 cells were labeled in uninjured lungs (Figure S4B). Krt8 expression was only detected in Cldn4+ DATPs on day 9 in the alveolar region after injury but was then prominent in Pdpn+ AT1 cells on day 28 after injury (Figures S4C–S4F). We also observed that a significant number of SPC+ AT2 cells were lineage-labeled by Ndrg1 and Krt8 on day 28 after bleomycin injury (Figures 3J and 3L; Figures S4G and S4H). To confirm that DATPs possessed the capacity to dedifferentiate into AT2 cells, we isolated AT2 cells (CD31−CD45−EpCAM+MHCII+) (Hasegawa et al., 2017Hasegawa K. Sato A. Tanimura K. Uemasu K.

Res. 2017; 18: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) from Krt8 reporter mice and performed organoid cultures in the presence of IL-1β (Figure S4I). On day 14 in culture, we added 4-OH tamoxifen to label Krt8-expressing DATPs. Consistent with immunostaining for Krt8 in organoids (Figure 2J), we detected Tomato+ cells (Krt8+ DATPs) in the inner part of organoids, which segregated distinctly from Tomato−MHC class II+ AT2 cells, as shown by flow cytometry analysis (Figures S4J and S4K). Furthermore, Krt8+ DATPs (Tomato+MHCII−) isolated from organoids were capable of forming organoids composed of DATPs and SPC+ AT2 cells (Figures S4K–S4M). Given that IL-1β treatment increased generation of DATPs in organoids, we next asked whether IL-1β signaling is required for differentiation into DATPs in vivo. To answer this question, we generated Il1r1flox/flox;SPC-CreERT2;R26RtdTomato mice to deplete Il1r1, a functional receptor for IL-1β, specifically in AT2 cells (Figure 4A). The proliferative activity of Il1r1-deficient AT2 cells was comparable with that of Il1r1-haplodeficient AT2 cells after injury (Figure S5A). Because IL-1β treatment increased organoid size and formation efficiency (Figures 2D and 2E), we carefully examined AT2 cell proliferation by 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays at an early time point (day 4) in organoid cultures. Although IL-1β-treated organoids revealed increases in EdU incorporation rates relative to the control, notably, Il1r1-deficient AT2 cells also showed a similar rate of EdU incorporation, indicating that IL-1β does not directly influence AT2 cell proliferation (Figure S5B). Given the differential expression of growth factors regulating AT2 cell proliferation in IL-1β-treated stromal cells co-cultured with AT2 cells in organoids (Figures S5C–S5E), it is highly likely that IL-1β enhances AT2 cell proliferation by modulating surrounding cells rather than by direct effects on AT2 cells. We then further analyzed cAT2 subsets (derived from AT2 lineage-labeled cells after injury; Figure 1B), which showed stepwise cell cycle transitions based on the expression of cell cycle phase-specific genes (Figure S5F). We discovered that AT2 cells acquired transcriptional signatures of pAT2 cells during transition from S to G2/M phase in the cell cycle (Figure S5G). During this transition, expression of naive AT2 cell markers, including Abca3, was downregulated, whereas the expression of genes associated with inflammatory response, including Ptges, was induced. Remarkably, Il1r1 expression was upregulated specifically in G2/M phase (Figure S5G). Importantly, we found that Il1r1-deficient AT2 cells failed to differentiate into DATPs on day 10 after injury (Figures 4B and 4C). Subsequently, lineage-labeled AT1 cells were significantly decreased on day 21 after injury, indicating impaired differentiation of AT2 cells into AT1 cells in the absence of IL-1β signaling (Figures 4D and 4E). Overall, these findings suggest that IL-1β does not directly influence the proliferative properties of AT2 cells but, instead, primes AT2 cells to initiate cell fate transition into DATPs during alveolar regeneration. In our next set of experiments, we asked which downstream transcription factors and/or signaling molecules driven by IL-1β are required for DATP differentiation. Upon further analysis of our in vivo and in vitro scRNA-seq data, we discovered a unique metabolic signature with higher expression of genes involved in the glycolysis pathway, such as Pgk1, Pkm, and Slc16a3 (Figure 4F). By measuring the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in organoids, we found that IL-1β enhanced glycolysis metabolism (Figures S6A and S6B). IL-1β-treated organoids also showed higher rates of glucose uptake compared with the control (Figure S6C). Notably, expression o"

Here, to search for such states and decipher their underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), we studied 10 melanoma cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as well as 26 additional cultures using bulk RNA-seq. Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared GRNs that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal states and the intermediate state. This intermediate state is corroborated by a distinct chromatin landscape and is governed by the transcription factors SOX6, NFATC2, EGR3, ELF1 and ETV4. Single-cell migration assays confirmed the intermediate migratory phenotype of this state. Using time-series sampling of single cells after knockdown of SOX10, we unravelled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of GRNs during phenotype switching. Taken together, these analyses indicate that an intermediate state exists and is driven by a distinct and stable ‘mixed’ GRN rather than being a symbiotic heterogeneous mix of cells. Profiling phenotype switching in melanoma. Wouters et al. perform large-scale gene expression analysis in patient samples and identify transcriptional networks that modulate the intermediate cell state and ultimate mesenchymal switching in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3047047760,"Background The extent to which people implement government-issued protective measures is critical in preventing further spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our study aimed to describe the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of these measures, and to identify communication channels used to acquire information on COVID-19 in European countries during the early stage of the pandemic. Methods and findings An online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated starting on March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we assessed enacted community containment measures by stage of stringency (I-IV). In total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). To explore possible dynamics as containment strategies intensified, we also included 1,365 responses submitted during the following week. Participants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands less frequently considered a complete social lockdown effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents applied enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%) and self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents reported being sufficiently informed about the outbreak and behaviors to avoid infection (range: 90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most commonly reported included television newspapers, official health websites, and social media. One week later, we observed no major differences in submitted responses. Conclusions During the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, belief in the effectiveness of protective measures among survey respondents from three European countries was high and participants reported feeling sufficiently informed. In March 2020, implementation of measures differed between countries and were highest among respondents from Italy, who were subjected to the most stringent lockdown measures and greatest COVID-19 burden in Europe during this period."
https://openalex.org/W3047495533,"The plasma membrane tension strongly affects cell surface processes, such as migration, endocytosis and signalling. However, it is not known whether the membrane tension of organelles regulates their functions, notably intracellular traffic. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III complex is the major membrane remodelling complex that drives intra-lumenal-vesicle (ILV) formation on endosomal membranes. Here we used a fluorescent membrane-tension probe to show that ESCRT-III subunits are recruited onto endosomal membranes when the membrane tension is reduced. We find that tension-dependent recruitment is associated with ESCRT-III polymerization and membrane deformation in vitro and correlates with increased ILV formation in ESCRT-III-decorated endosomes in vivo. Finally, we find that the endosomal membrane tension decreases when ILV formation is triggered by EGF under physiological conditions. These results indicate that membrane tension is a major regulator of ILV formation and endosome trafficking, leading us to conclude that membrane tension can control organelle functions."
https://openalex.org/W3046372953,"Autophagy is a homeostatic process with multiple functions in mammalian cells. Here, we show that mammalian Atg8 proteins (mAtg8s) and the autophagy regulator IRGM control TFEB, a transcriptional activator of the lysosomal system. IRGM directly interacted with TFEB and promoted the nuclear translocation of TFEB. An mAtg8 partner of IRGM, GABARAP, interacted with TFEB. Deletion of all mAtg8s or GABARAPs affected the global transcriptional response to starvation and downregulated subsets of TFEB targets. IRGM and GABARAPs countered the action of mTOR as a negative regulator of TFEB. This was suppressed by constitutively active RagB, an activator of mTOR. Infection of macrophages with the membrane-permeabilizing microbe Mycobacterium tuberculosis or infection of target cells by HIV elicited TFEB activation in an IRGM-dependent manner. Thus, IRGM and its interactors mAtg8s close a loop between the autophagosomal pathway and the control of lysosomal biogenesis by TFEB, thus ensuring coordinated activation of the two systems that eventually merge during autophagy. Kumar et al. show that mammalian Atg8 proteins along with IRGM regulate the lysosomal system via mTOR and TFEB, respectively, in the response to pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3047043647,"Coral reefs worldwide are degrading due to climate change, overfishing, pollution, coastal development, coral bleaching, and diseases. In areas where the natural recovery of an ecosystem is negligible or protection through management interventions insufficient, active restoration becomes critical. The Reef Futures symposium in 2018 brought together over 400 reef restoration experts, businesses, and civil organizations, and galvanized them to save coral reefs through restoration or identify alternative solutions. The symposium highlighted that solutions and discoveries from long-term and ongoing coral reef restoration projects in Spanish-speaking countries in the Caribbean and Eastern Tropical Pacific were not well known internationally. Therefore, a meeting of scientists and practitioners working in these locations was held to compile the data on the extent of coral reef restoration efforts, advances and challenges. Here, we present unpublished data from 12 coral reef restoration case studies from five Latin American countries, describe their motivations and techniques used, and provide estimates on total annual project cost per unit area of reef intervened, spatial extent as well as project duration. We found that most projects used direct transplantation, the coral gardening method, micro-fragmentation or larval propagation, and aimed to optimize or scale-up restoration approaches (51%) or provide alternative, sustainable livelihood opportunities (15%) followed by promoting coral reef conservation stewardship and re-establishing a self-sustaining, functioning reef ecosystems (both 13%). Reasons for restoring coral reefs were mainly biotic and experimental (both 42%), followed by idealistic and pragmatic motivations (both 8%). The median annual total cost from all projects was $93,000 USD (range: $10,000 USD—$331,802 USD) (2018 dollars) and intervened a median spatial area of 1 ha (range: 0.06 ha—8.39 ha). The median project duration was 3 years; however, projects have lasted up to 17 years. Project feasibility was high with a median of 0.7 (range: 0.5–0.8). This study closes the knowledge gap between academia and practitioners and overcomes the language barrier by providing the first comprehensive compilation of data from ongoing coral reef restoration efforts in Latin America."
https://openalex.org/W3047258103,"This paper considers the analysis of continuous time gradient-based optimization algorithms through the lens of nonlinear contraction theory. It demonstrates that in the case of a time-invariant objective, most elementary results on gradient descent based on convexity can be replaced by much more general results based on contraction. In particular, gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if its dynamics are contracting in any metric, with convexity of the cost corresponding to the special case of contraction in the identity metric. More broadly, contraction analysis provides new insights for the case of geodesically-convex optimization, wherein non-convex problems in Euclidean space can be transformed to convex ones posed over a Riemannian manifold. In this case, natural gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if it is contracting in any metric, with geodesic convexity of the cost corresponding to contraction in the natural metric. New results using semi-contraction provide additional insights into the topology of the set of optimizers in the case when multiple optima exist. Furthermore, they show how semi-contraction may be combined with specific additional information to reach broad conclusions about a dynamical system. The contraction perspective also easily extends to time-varying optimization settings and allows one to recursively build large optimization structures out of simpler elements. Extensions to natural primal-dual optimization and game-theoretic contexts further illustrate the potential reach of these new perspectives."

Identifying novel drivers of invasion and metastasis holds therapeutic potential for the disease. We conducted a gain-of-function invasion screen, which identified two separate hits, IMPAD1 and KDELR2, as robust, independent drivers of lung cancer invasion and metastasis. Given that IMPAD1 and KDELR2 are known to be localized to the ER–Golgi pathway, we studied their common mechanism of driving in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis and demonstrated that they enhance Golgi-mediated function and secretion. Therapeutically inhibiting matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) suppressed both IMPAD1- and KDELR2-mediated invasion. The hits from this unbiased screen and the mechanistic validation highlight Golgi function as one of the key cellular features altered during invasion and metastasis."

Choosing students with the greatest likelihood of success is considered a key part of improving research outcomes. There has been little empirical investigation of what factors drive the outcomes from a student's PhD and whether ranking procedures are effective in student selection. Here we show that, the research environment had a decisive influence: students who conducted research in one of the University's priority research areas and who had experienced, research-intensive, supervisors had significantly better outcomes from their PhD in terms of number of manuscripts published, citations, average impact factor of journals published in, and reduced attrition rates. In contrast, students’ previous academic outcomes and research training was unrelated to outcomes. Furthermore, students who received a scholarship to support their studies generated significantly more publications in higher impact journals, their work was cited more often and they were less likely to withdraw from their PhD. The findings suggest that experienced supervisors researching in a priority research area facilitate PhD student productivity. The findings question the utility of assigning PhD scholarships solely on the basis of student academic merit, once minimum entry requirements are met. Given that citations, publication numbers and publications in higher ranked journals drive university rankings, and that publications from PhD student contribute approximately one-third of all research outputs from universities, strengthening research infrastructure and supervision teams may be more important considerations for maximising the contribution of PhD students to a university’s international standing."

A secondary objective was to gain visualization and insight into the atomization break up mechanism caused by the effects of viscosity and surface tension on primary break-up, sheet disintegration, ligament and droplet formation. High speed imaging was used to capture the near-nozzle characteristics for water and drug formulations. This demonstrated more rapid atomization for lower viscosities. Image processing was used to analyze the near-nozzle spray characteristics during the primary break-up of the liquid sheet into ligament formation. Edges of the liquid sheet, spray break-up length, break-up radius, cone angle and dispersion angle were obtained. Spray characteristics pertinent for primary breakup modelling were determined from high speed imaging of multiple spray actuations.

This study investigated CoNS obtained from blood cultures of neonates for antibiotic resistance and virulence factors, and possible association with inflammatory response (C-reactive protein). A total of 93 CoNS isolates were collected from 76 blood cultures of neonates at the Maternity hospital in Kuwait in a six-month period and investigated for susceptibility to antibiotics, carriage of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), and virulence-associated genes. The 93 CoNS isolates consisted of S. epidermidis (76; 81.7%), S. capitis (12; 12.9%), S. hominis (2; 2.1%), S. warneri (2; 2.1%) and S. haemolyticus (1; 1.0%). Eighty-six (92.4%) of the isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (MR-CoNS) while 49 (52.7%) expressed multi-antibiotic resistance. The methicillin-resistant isolates (MR-CoNS) carried SCCmec III, SCCmec IVa and four combinations of SCCmec types including SCCmec types I+IVa (one S. warneri and 25 S. epidermidis isolates), types I+III (one S. epidermidis isolate), types III+IVa (six S. epidermidis isolates) and types I+III+IVa (one S. epidermidis isolate). The most common virulence-related genes were icaC, seb, arc detected in 69.7%, 60.5%, 40.8% of the isolates respectively. Two isolates were positive for tst1. No association between C-reactive protein and antibiotic resistance or virulence factors was established. This study revealed that S. epidermidis carrying different SCCmec genetic elements, was the dominant CoNS species isolated from neonatal blood cultures with 90.3% and 36.6% of the isolates positive for genes for biofilm and ACME production respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3047255755,"We investigated rock varnish, a thin, manganese- and iron-rich, dark surface crust, on basaltic lava flows and petroglyphs in the Owens and Rose Valleys (California) by portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and femtosecond laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (fs-LA-ICPMS). The major element composition of the varnish was consistent with a mixture of Mn-Fe oxyhydroxides and clay minerals. As expected, it contained elevated concentrations of elements that are typically enriched in rock varnish, e.g., Mn, Pb, Ba, Ce, and Co, but also showed unusually high enrichments in U, Cu, and Th. The rare earth and yttrium (REY) enrichment pattern revealed a very strong positive cerium (Ce) anomaly and distinct negative europium (Eu) and Y anomalies. The light rare earth elements (REE) were much more strongly enriched than the heavy REY. These enrichment patterns are consistent with a formation mechanism by leaching of Mn and trace elements from aeolian dust, reprecipitation of Mn and Fe as oxyhydroxides, and scavenging of trace elements by these oxyhydroxides. We inferred accumulation rates of Mn and Fe in the varnish from their areal densities measured by pXRF and the known ages of some of the lava flow surfaces. The areal densities of Mn and Fe, as well as their accumulation rates, were comparable to our previous results from the desert of Saudi Arabia. There was a moderate dependence of the Mn areal density on the inclination of the rock surfaces, but no relationship to its cardinal orientation. We attempted to use the degree of varnish regrowth on the rock art surfaces as an estimate of their age. While an absolute dating of the petroglyphs was not possible because of the lack of suitable calibration surfaces and a considerable amount of variability, the measured degree of varnish regrowth on the various petroglyphs was consistent with chronologies based on archeological and other archaeometric techniques. In particular, our results suggest that rock art creation in the study area continued over an extended period of time, possibly starting around the Pleistocene/Holocene transition and extending into the last few centuries."

https://openalex.org/W3047210218,"A student's ability to learn effectively in a classroom setting is subject to many factors. While some factors are difficult to regulate, this study explores two factors that a student, or instructor, has full control over, namely 1) seating position, and 2) computer usage. Both factors have been studied considerably with regard to their effects on student performance, and the results indicate that sitting further from the instructor, or using a computer in the classroom, are related to a decline in grade performance. However, it is unclear if the choice of where to sit and whether or not to use a computer in class are mediated by the same cognitive process. If they are the same, then we would expect to see an interaction between the factors, such that, for example, computer usage would most negatively impact the grades of students who sit near the back of a class. This study aims to answer this question by looking at the individual and combined effects of seating position and computer usage on classroom performance. We sampled 1364 students, collecting nearly 3000 total responses across 5 different introductory psychology courses with 4 different instructors on 3 separate occasions. In agreement with previous research, we found that sitting further from the instructor negatively impacted students' grades (0.75 percentage points/row), and using a computer in class negatively impacted grades (by 3.88 percentage points). Our novel finding is that these deleterious effects combined in an additive manner, such that using a computer had the same harmful effect on grade performance regardless of whether the student sat at the front or back of the classroom."

CXCR4 signaling is involved in several aspects of tumor progression and metastases (30Shi J. Wei Y. Xia J. Wang S. Wu J. Chen F. Huang G. Chen J.

Cancer. 2004; 4 (15229479): 540-55010.1038/nrc1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), yet the mechanisms governing CXCR4 signaling remain poorly understood. Although GRKs and β-arrestins negatively regulate CXCR4 by canonical homologous desensitization (32Busillo J.M. Benovic J.L. Regulation of CXCR4 signaling.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768 (17169327): 952-96310.1016/j.bbamem.2006.11.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), β-arrestins can also promote CXCR4 signaling. In particular, β-arr1 (β-arrestin 1) is necessary for the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), but not Akt or ERK-1/2, by CXCR4 (33). A unique feature of FAK activation by β-arr1 is that it requires the assistance of endocytic adaptor protein STAM1 (signal-transducing adaptor molecule 1) (33Alekhina O. Marchese A. β-Arrestin1 and signal-transducing adaptor Molecule 1 (STAM1) cooperate to promote focal adhesion kinase autophosphorylation and chemotaxis via the chemokine receptor CXCR4.J. Biol.

Because binding to β-arr1 is enhanced by CXCR4 activation (34Malik R. Marchese A. Arrestin-2 interacts with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery to modulate endosomal sorting of CXCR4.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21 (20505072): 2529-254110.1091/mbc.e10-02-0169Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is likely that STAM1 prefers to bind to the receptor-bound, fully activated conformation of β-arr1. This is likely required to interact with and activate FAK, because a physical complex of β-arr1, STAM1, and FAK is formed following receptor activation, and they also co-localize at or near the cell periphery (33Alekhina O. Marchese A. β-Arrestin1 and signal-transducing adaptor Molecule 1 (STAM1) cooperate to promote focal adhesion kinase autophosphorylation and chemotaxis via the chemokine receptor CXCR4.J. Biol.

Once bound to GPCRs, β-arrestins undergo a global conformational change that enhances their ability to bind to effector molecules (15Zhuo Y. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Zhan X. Gurevich V.V. Klug C.S. Identification of receptor binding-induced conformational changes in non-visual arrestins.J. Biol.

Because β-arr1 binding to activated and phosphorylated CXCR4 changes its ability to bind to STAM1, the interaction with STAM1 is likely driven by conformational changes in β-arrestin. STAM1 mainly binds to the N domain of β-arr1 between residues 25 and 161 (33Alekhina O. Marchese A. β-Arrestin1 and signal-transducing adaptor Molecule 1 (STAM1) cooperate to promote focal adhesion kinase autophosphorylation and chemotaxis via the chemokine receptor CXCR4.J. Biol.

However, the precise structural or conformational determinants that dictate STAM1 binding remain unknown. Arrestins have several regions that become available for binding to effector molecules once activated by receptor binding. Importantly, the region between amino acid residues 89 and 97 of the N domain in β-arr2 referred to as arrestin switch region I (39Chen Q. Perry N.A. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Berndt S. Gilbert N.C. Zhuo Y.

Commun. 2017; 8 (29127291): 142710.1038/s41467-017-01218-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) is an element that undergoes considerable movement from the basal state to the active state and might mediate agonist-dependent interactions with effector molecules (40Chen Q. Iverson T.M. Gurevich V.V. Structural basis of arrestin-dependent signal transduction.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2018; 43 (29636212): 412-42310.1016/j.tibs.2018.03.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This region in β-arr2 contains two PXXP motifs, which are recognition sites for SH3 domains and likely mediate agonist-dependent binding to c-Src by GPCRs (39Chen Q. Perry N.A. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Berndt S. Gilbert N.C. Zhuo Y. Singh P.K. Tholen J. Ohi M.D. Gurevich E.V. Brautigam C.A. Klug K.S. Gurevich V.V. Iverson T.M. Structural basis of arrestin-3 activation and signaling.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (29127291): 142710.1038/s41467-017-01218-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The analogous region in β-arr1 contains only one PXXP motif, but it is unclear whether it can interact with SH3 domains. Notably, although STAM1 encodes an SH3 domain, it mainly interacts with β-arr1 via its coiled-coil region (34Malik R. Marchese A. Arrestin-2 interacts with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery to modulate endosomal sorting of CXCR4.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21 (20505072): 2529-254110.1091/mbc.e10-02-0169Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether arrestin switch region I or a previously unidentified switch region binds to STAM1 remains to be determined. Here, we investigated the structural and biophysical properties of the interaction between β-arr1 and STAM1 by EPR spectroscopy. Using continuous wave (CW) EPR, we mapped the STAM1-binding site to a discrete region at the base of the finger loop. To determine whether binding to this region causes a global or localized conformational change in β-arr1, we used another EPR approach known as double electron–electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy that measures distances between two intramolecular spin labels attached at specific sites. The DEER data show that STAM1 binding induces movement of the finger loop, similar to GPCRs, but does not induce movement of two other regions known to undergo large movements upon GPCR binding (15Zhuo Y. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Zhan X. Gurevich V.V. Klug C.S. Identification of receptor binding-induced conformational changes in non-visual arrestins.J. Biol.

The finger loop is located between β-strands 5 and 6 and is considered to represent a major binding region for activated GPCRs (39Chen Q. Perry N.A. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Berndt S. Gilbert N.C. Zhuo Y. Singh P.K. Tholen J. Ohi M.D. Gurevich E.V. Brautigam C.A. Klug K.S. Gurevich V.V. Iverson T.M. Structural basis of arrestin-3 activation and signaling.Nat.

Mutation of residues within the STAM1-binding site reduced agonist-dependent STAM1 binding but not CXCR4 binding, indicating that the STAM1-binding site does not overlap with the GPCR-binding site. Expression of a STAM1-deficient β-arr1–binding mutant that could still bind to CXCR4 reduced FAK activation, but not ERK-1/2, by CXCR4. We provide evidence of a novel region of β-arr1 specifying β-arrestin–dependent signaling. We used DEER spectroscopy to determine whether STAM1 binding induces conformational changes in β-arr1 by introducing spin labels at two reporter sites within β-arr1. The position of the spin labels was selected based on previous studies that revealed large conformational changes upon GPCR binding, including C-tail displacement, finger-loop extension, and middle-loop movement (15Zhuo Y. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Zhan X. Gurevich V.V. Klug C.S. Identification of receptor binding-induced conformational changes in non-visual arrestins.J. Biol.

To report on C-tail displacement, the spin labels were placed on the C-tail (A392C) and the N domain (A12C). DEER-derived distance distributions are shown as overlays for the free (black) and STAM1-bound (blue) states (Fig. 1b). In the basal state, the C-tail is folded back onto the N domain, which helps to stabilize the inactive conformation of β-arr1 and is consistent with a small interspin distance between positions 12 and 392 (Fig. 1b). Upon GPCR binding, there is a large increase in the interspin distance, consistent with C-tail release from the N domain, as previously reported (15Zhuo Y. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Zhan X. Gurevich V.V. Klug C.S. Identification of receptor binding-induced conformational changes in non-visual arrestins.J. Biol.

However, STAM1 did not induce distance changes between spin labels at 12 and 392, indicating that the C-tail position is not affected by STAM1 binding (Fig. 1b). Middle-loop movement was assessed by placing both spin labels on the N domain at positions 136 and 167 (T136C and V167C) (Fig. 1a). STAM1 did not induce conformational changes in the middle loop, because no distance changes were observed between spin labels at positions 136 and 167 (Fig. 1c). This is in contrast to GPCR binding, which induced distance changes between spin labels in these positions, indicating the N domain moving away from the C domain (15Zhuo Y. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Zhan X. Gurevich V.V. Klug C.S. Identification of receptor binding-induced conformational changes in non-visual arrestins.J. Biol.

By placing one spin label at site 167 (V167C) and the other at 68 (L68C), we were able to assess finger-loop movement (Fig. 1a). In contrast to C-tail displacement or middle-loop movement, STAM1 binding induced finger-loop extension (Fig. 1d). STAM1 induced a large distance change between these spin labels from 21 to 25 Å (Fig. 1d). This is similar to GPCR-binding, which also induces a distance change between positions 68 and 167, as previously shown (15Zhuo Y. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Zhan X. Gurevich V.V. Klug C.S.

The attached spin labels on the β-arr1 double-cysteine mutants did not impact STAM1 binding, as assessed by pulldown assay (Fig. 2a), similar to what was previously observed with binding to GPCR (15Zhuo Y. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Zhan X. Gurevich V.V. Klug C.S. Identification of receptor binding-induced conformational changes in non-visual arrestins.J. Biol.

These data provide evidence that unlike GPCRs, STAM1 does not promote global conformational change in β-arr1, suggesting that STAM1 and GPCRs interact with the N domain differently. To precisely map the STAM1-binding site on β-arr1, we employed site-directed spin-labeling CW EPR spectroscopy. EPR spectroscopy takes advantage of the fact that the spin labels have a paramagnetic center and when the label is attached to a unique cysteine on the surface of a protein, the spectrum reflects its mobility. Spin labels that are mobile display spectra that are narrow with sharp peaks; however, when a protein partner binds at or near the spin label or a conformational change constrains its mobility, the spectral lines broaden and decrease in amplitude (43Hubbell W.L.

Specific inhibitors that selectively target ARH3 would be a useful tool to examine DNA damage repair, as well as a possible strategy for tumor suppression. However, efforts to date have not identified any suitable compounds. Here, we used in silico and biochemistry screening to search for ARH3 inhibitors. We discovered a small molecule compound named ARH3 inhibitor 26 (AI26) as, to our knowledge, the first ARH3 inhibitor. AI26 binds to the catalytic pocket of ARH3 and inhibits the enzymatic activity of ARH3 with an estimated IC50 of ∼2.41 μm in vitro. Moreover, hydrolysis of DNA damage–induced ADP-ribosylation was clearly inhibited when cells were pretreated with AI26, leading to defects in DNA damage repair. In addition, tumor cells with DNA damage repair defects were hypersensitive to AI26 treatment, as well as combinations of AI26 and other DNA-damaging agents such as camptothecin and doxorubicin. Collectively, these results reveal not only a chemical probe to study ARH3-mediated DNA damage repair but also a chemotherapeutic strategy for tumor suppression.

Genomic DNA can be damaged by numerous internal and external hazards. However, during evolution, cells have developed sophisticated systems to sense and repair DNA lesions. One of the earliest DNA damage responses is protein ADP-ribosylation. DNA damage–induced ADP-ribosylation is mainly catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), a group of enzymes transferring ADP-ribose (ADPR) residue from NAD+ to amino acid residues (1Rouleau M. Patel A. Hendzel M.J. Kaufmann S.H. Poirier G.G. PARP inhibition: PARP1 and beyond.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10 (20200537): 293-30110.1038/nrc2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 2Gupte R.

To date, 17 members have been identified in PARP family enzymes (3Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. The diverse biological roles of mammalian PARPS, a small but powerful family of poly-ADP-ribose polymerases.Front.

Among these enzymes, PARP1, PARP2, PARP5a, and PARP5b catalyze poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (also called PARylation) by mediating the glycosidic bond formation between each ADPR unit, whereas PARP9 and PARP13 are enzymatically inactive proteins because they lack key catalytic residues (4Aguiar R.C.T.

The remaining 11 PARPs catalyze mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation (MARylation) (2Gupte R. Liu Z. Kraus W.L. PARPs and ADP-ribosylation: recent advances linking molecular functions to biological outcomes.Genes Dev. 2017; 31 (28202539): 101-12610.1101/gad.291518.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, both PARylation and MARylation occur to mediate DNA damage response and repair (7Liu C. Vyas A. Kassab M.A. Singh A.K. Yu X.

Because each ADPR unit has two phosphate moieties, PARylation or multiple MARylation bring a huge amount of negative charges to the chromatin close to DNA lesions (7Liu C. Vyas A.

The role of poly ADP-ribosylation in the first wave of DNA damage response.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28854736): 8129-814110.1093/nar/gkx565Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Poirier G.G. de Murcia G.

Because DNA is also negatively charged, the charge repulsion may induce chromatin relaxation, which facilitates DNA damage repair (7Liu C. Vyas A. Kassab M.A. Singh A.K. Yu X.

Over the past 15 years, accumulated evidence suggests that ADP-ribosylation acts as an early wave of signal at DNA lesions and is recognized by PARylation and/or MARylation binding motifs (7Liu C. Vyas A. Kassab M.A. Singh A.K. Yu X.

ADP-ribosylation on arginine is catalyzed by specific arginine ADP-ribosyltransferases (also called ATRCs) or bacterial toxins and may be not associated with DNA damage repair (16Leutert M. Menzel S.

More recently, serine was shown to be linked with ADPR, which is catalyzed by PARP1 following DNA damage (17Bonfiglio J.J. Fontana P. Zhang Q. Colby T. Gibbs-Seymour I. Atanassov I. Bartlett E.

The detailed molecular mechanism of ADP-ribosylation on other residues remains elusive. It has been shown that PARP1-mediated serine ADP-ribosylation is one of the major types of ADP-ribosylation that facilitates DNA damage repair (19Palazzo L. Leidecker O. Prokhorova E. Dauben H. Matic I. Ahel I. Serine is the major residue for ADP-ribosylation upon DNA damage.eLife. 2018; 7 (29480802): e3433410.7554/eLife.34334Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HPF1, a co-factor and functional partner of PARP1, interacts with the catalytic domain of PARP1 for promoting ADP-ribosylation on serine (17Bonfiglio J.J. Fontana P. Zhang Q. Colby T.

Moreover, ARH3 was recently identified as an ADP-ribosylhydrolase that removes ADP-ribosylation from serine residue (20Fontana P. Bonfiglio J.J. Palazzo L. Bartlett E. Matic I. Ahel I. Serine ADP-ribosylation reversal by the hydrolase ARH3.eLife. 2017; 6 (28650317): e2853310.7554/eLife.28533Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Abplanalp J. Leutert M. Frugier E. Nowak K.

Interestingly, in addition to removing the last ADPR from serine, ARH3 is able to digest the glycosidic bond between ADPR units, thus hydrolyzing PAR chain, suggesting that ARH3 may specifically remove PARylation and/or MARylation on serine residue (20Fontana P. Bonfiglio J.J. Palazzo L. Bartlett E. Matic I. Ahel I.

Accumulated evidence suggests that like PARylation/MARylation, dePARylation and deMARylation may play equally important roles in DNA damage repair (7Liu C. Vyas A. Kassab M.A. Singh A.K. Yu X. The role of poly ADP-ribosylation in the first wave of DNA damage response.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28854736): 8129-814110.1093/nar/gkx565Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Kassab M.A. Yu X.

Adv. 2019; 5 (30989114): eaav434010.1126/sciadv.aav4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is likely that transient ADP-ribosylation mediates the recruitment of DNA damage repair factors to the proximity of DNA lesion (7Liu C. Vyas A. Kassab M.A. Singh A.K. Yu X. The role of poly ADP-ribosylation in the first wave of DNA damage response.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28854736): 8129-814110.1093/nar/gkx565Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). DePARylation and deMARylation may act as immediate downstream events following transient ADP-ribosylation and facilitate loading DNA damage repair factors onto the sites of DNA lesions (24Chen S.H. Yu X. Targeting dePARylation selectively suppresses DNA repair-defective and PARP inhibitor-resistant malignancies.Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 (30989114): eaav434010.1126/sciadv.aav4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Otherwise, those ADPR-binding DNA repair factors may be trapped by any prolonged ADP-ribosylation (7Liu C. Vyas A. Kassab M.A. Singh A.K. Yu X. The role of poly ADP-ribosylation in the first wave of DNA damage response.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28854736): 8129-814110.1093/nar/gkx565Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Kassab M.A. Yu X.

Thus, it has been well-known that suppression of dePARylation severely inhibits DNA damage repair (24Chen S.H. Yu X.

Similar to PARP inhibitor, emerging evidence suggests that targeting dePARylation has similar effects on the suppression of DNA damage repair, as well as tumor cell growth (23Kassab M.A. Yu X. The role of dePARylation in DNA damage repair and cancer suppression.DNA Repair. 2019; 76 (30807923): 20-2910.1016/j.dnarep.2019.02.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 24Chen S.H. Yu X.

However, to date, the specific inhibitors targeting ARH3 have not been identified yet. Here, we discovered a unique small molecule compound that suppresses the enzymatic activity of ARH3 and ARH3-dependent DNA damage repair. Recently, we and others solved the crystal structure of ARH3 and ADPR complex (PDB code 5ZQY), in which ADPR forms multiple contacts within the catalytic pocket of ARH3 (32Wang M. Yuan Z. Xie R. Ma Y. Liu X. Yu X. Structure–function analyses reveal the mechanism of the ARH3-dependent hydrolysis of ADP-ribosylation.J. Biol.

Based on the structure of the complex and small molecule compound library of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), we designed a strategy that combines both virtual screening and biochemical screening to search for specific small molecules targeting ARH3 (Fig. 1A). Using an in silico approach, we first screened more than 260,000 compounds from NCI small molecule database and modeled the compounds that could be inserted into the catalytic pocket of ARH3 and suppress its activity (Fig. 1B). Based on the docking scores, chemical structures of the compounds, and their availability from the NCI, we selected 71 candidates for the secondary biochemical screening using dot-blotting assays with anti-PAR antibody. We generated recombinant ARH3 and synthesized PAR. With mock treatment, PAR can be detected by anti-PAR antibody in the dot-blotting assay as a positive control. However, when PAR was incubated with recombinant ARH3, PAR was digested by ARH3 and could not be detected in the dot-blotting assay, which served as a negative control. Next, we included each candidate compound (100 μm) in the reaction mixture. Interestingly, compound 26 completely suppressed ARH3-mediated PAR digestion, whereas compound 71 mildly inhibited the enzymatic activity of ARH3 (Fig. 1C). To further explore the small molecule inhibitors of ARH3, we focused on compound 26 and named it ARH3 inhibitor 26 (AI26). We examined the compound using LC–MS and found the single retention peak in HPLC analysis, indicating the single molecule purity. The following quadrupole TOF–MS shows that the molecule weight of the compound is 421.1696, confirming the identity of the compound (Fig. 1D). Next, we diluted the concentration of AI26 in the in vitro ARH3-mediated PAR digestion assays and measured the estimated IC50 of AI26 as 2.41 μm in this in vitro assay (Fig. 1E). To further characterize the biochemical feature of this ARH3 inhibitor, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay to measure the binding affinity between recombinant ARH3 and AI26. The average dissociation constant (Kd) obtained from three independent experiments is 1.82 ± 0.3 μm with 1:1 stoichiometric binding (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1). Moreover, computational modeling suggests that AI26 fits into the prolonged and linear catalytic groove, which may not only occupy the catalytic site but also extend the contact with other adjacent residues (Fig. 2B). Detailed analysis indicates that two amino groups in the benzofuran I of AI26 may form hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues such as Thr76, Asp77, and Asp316, which directly mediates the hydrolysis of the ester bond between ADPR and serine (serine deMARylation), as well as the glycosidic bond between two ADPR units (dePARylation). Also, another hydrogen bond occurs in the Gly115 and one amino group in the benzofuran I. Interestingly, two amino groups on the benzofuran II of AI26 may form hydrogen bonds with residues Phe143, Lys146, and Gly147 that are in the outside of the catalytic site. Additionally, Tyr149 and Phe143 may also interact with AI26 benzofuran II through π–π stacking interactions, which may not be involved in catalysis (Fig. 2C). Structural analyses show that the carbonyl group on the main chain of Phe143 forms hydrogen bonds with amino groups on the main chain of Gly145 and Lys146, and the side chain of Phe143 points to protein surface of ARH3 and does not have any interaction with other ARH3 residues (Fig. S2A). Thus, we generated a Phe143-to-Ala (F143A) mutation and hypothesized that this mutation does not abolish the tertiary structure of ARH3 but disrupts the interaction with AI26. To test the hypothesis, we performed thermal shift assay using the WT ARH3 and the F143A mutant proteins and found that the F143A mutant had very similar melting temperature with WT ARH3 (Fig. S2B), indicating that this mutation may not affect the overall folding of ARH3. Instead, the F143A mutation abolished the interaction between ARH3 and AI26 (Fig. S3A). However, because the side chain of Phe143 extends toward the outside of the catalytic groove, the F143A mutation still largely retained the enzymatic activity (Fig. S3B). Interestingly, because the mutation abolished the interaction with AI26, AI26 could not suppress the enzymatic activity of F143A (Fig. 2D). These results validate that AI26 occupied the catalytic pocket and surrounding areas of ARH3. In addition to ARH3, other enzymes such as MacroD1 and TARG1 also digest the ester bond between ADPR and amino acid residues. Moreover, like ARH3, MacroD1 can digest the glycosidic bond between two ADPRs (34Rosenthal F. Feijs K.L. Frugier E. Bonalli M. Forst A.H. Imhof R. Winkler H.C. Fischer D. Caflisch A. Hassa P.O. Lüscher B. Hottiger M.O. Macrodomain-containing proteins are new mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (23474714): 502-50710.1038/nsmb.2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, the catalytic pockets of both MacroD1 and TARG1 are L-shaped folds, whereas that of ARH3 adopts prolonged and linear conformation, which is more extended compared with those of TARG1 and MacroD1 (Fig. 2E). Thus, AI26 is unlikely to fit into the catalytic pockets of TARG1 and MacroD1. Moreover, because ADPR is twisted in the catalytic pocket of ARH1, this ADPR-recognition pocket is much smaller than that of ARH3, indicating there is no enough space for accommodating the benzofuran II of AI26. Consequently, AI26 did not inhibit the enzymatic activities of these ADPR hydrolases (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these results suggest that AI26 specifically suppresses the enzymatic activity of ARH3 by binding to its catalytic pocket. Next, we asked whether AI26 was able to suppress ARH3-mediated ADP-ribosylation hydrolysis in cells. We used laser microirradiation to induce DNA damage in the nucleus of U2OS cell. Using immunofluorescent staining with anti-ADPR antibody, we examined the kinetics of DNA damage–induced ADP-ribosylation in the time course assays. We found that ADP-ribosylation occurred within 1 min following laser microirradiation and was hydrolyzed within 30 min. However, when the cells were pretreated with AI26, the DNA damage–induced ADP-ribosylation was largely prolonged (Fig. 3A), which is in agreement with an earlier study that serine ADP-ribosylation is one of the major types of ADP-ribosylation during DNA damage repair (20Fontana P. Bonfiglio J.J. Palazzo L. Bartlett E. Matic I. Ahel I. Serine ADP-ribosylation reversal by the hydrolase ARH3.eLife. 2017; 6 (28650317): e2853310.7554/eLife.28533Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Abplanalp J. Leutert M. Frugier E. Nowak K. Feurer R. Kato J. Kistemaker H.V.A. Filippov D.V. Moss J. Caflisch A. Hottiger M.O. Proteomic analyses identify ARH3 as a serine mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (29234005): 205510.1038/s41467-017-02253-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To further validate the inhibition effect of AI26 treatment, we used the KillerRed system to induce oxidative damage in U2OS cells. Again, ADP-ribosylation was occurred quickly in the mock treated cells and was removed within 30 min following DNA damage. However, AI26 treatment clearly suppressed hydrolysis of ADP-ribosylation at the sites of DNA damage (Fig. 3B). Moreover, we treated U2OS cells with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) to induce global ADP-ribosylation. Using dot-blotting assays, we examined the removal kinetics of ADP-ribosylation. Compared with the mock treatment, AI26 treatment was able to suppress the removal of global DNA damage–induced ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 3C). We and others have shown that ADP-ribosylation mediates the recruitment of DNA damage repair factors to DNA lesions (7Liu C. Vyas A. Kassab M.A. Singh A.K. Yu X. The role of poly ADP-ribosylation in the first wave of DNA damage response.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28854736): 8129-814110.1093/nar/gkx565Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The prolonged ADP-ribosylation may trap these DNA damage repair factors at DNA lesions for prolonged time. To examine this possibility, we studied the recruitment of XRCC1, which is a bona fide ADPR-binding DNA repair factor that is involved in DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR) (35Breslin C. Hornyak P. Ridley A. Rulten S.L. Hanzlikova H. Oliver A.W. Caldecott K.W. The XRCC1 phosphate-binding pocket binds poly (ADP-ribose) and is required for XRCC1 function.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (26130715): 6934-694410.1093/nar/gkv623Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similar to the kinetics of DNA damage–induced ADP-ribosylation, XRCC1 was retained at laser strip as well as KillerRed sites for prolonged time when cells were pretreated with AI26 (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that suppression of ARH3-mediated ADPR hydrolysis traps DNA damage repair factors at DNA lesions. Because trapping ADPR-binding DNA repair factors may impair DNA damage repair, we performed comet assays with alkaline condition to measure the kinetics of SSBR and found that suppression of ARH3-mediated ADPR hydrolysis by AI26 remarkably impaired SSBR (Fig. 4C). In addition to SSBR, ADP-ribosylation participates in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) (36Ray Chaudhuri A. Nussenzweig A. The multifaceted roles of PARP1 in DNA repair and chromatin remodelling.Nat. Rev. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W3047002038,"Background This is a multi-method, in-depth, three part qualitative study exploring the regulation and practice of secondary research with tissue and data in a high-income country. We explore and compare the perspectives of researchers, research ethics committees (RECs) and other relevant professionals (e.g. pathologists and clinicians). We focus on points of contention because they demonstrate misalignment between the expectations, values and assumptions of these stakeholders. Methods This is a multi-method study using observational research, focus groups and interviews with 42 participants (conducted 2016–2017) and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Results are arranged under the following themes: consent; balancing the social value of the research with consent requirements; and harm. Our findings demonstrate different perspectives on the review process, styles of ethical reasoning and issues of concern. First, researchers and RECs disagreed about whether the cost of re-consenting patients satisfied the criterion of impracticability for consent waivers. Second, most researchers were skeptical that secondary research with already collected tissue and data could harm patients. Researchers often pointed to the harm arising from a failure to use existing material for research. RECs were concerned about the potential for secondary research to stigmatize communities. Third, researchers adopted a more consequentialist approach to decision-making, including some willingness to trade off the benefit of the research against the cost of getting consent; whereas RECs were more deontological and typically considered research benefit only after it had been established that re-consent was impractical. Conclusion This research highlights ways in which RECs and researchers may be talking past each other, resulting in confusion and frustration. These finding provide a platform for realignment of the expectations of RECs and researchers, which could contribute to making research ethics review more effective."
https://openalex.org/W3047261220,"Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with cardiovascular co-morbidities and mortality. Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk and mortality, and is influenced by the presence of OSA and related comorbidities. There is a paucity of data regarding long-term evolution of arterial stiffness in CPAP-treated OSA patients. We aimed to prospectively study long term PWV variations and determinants of PWV deterioration. Methods In a prospective obese OSA cohort, at time of diagnosis and after several years of follow-up we collected arterial stiffness measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), clinical and metabolic parameters, and CPAP adherence. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed in order to determine contributing factors. Results Seventy two OSA patients (men: 52.8%, median age: 55.8 years and median BMI of 38.5 kg/m2) with a prevalence of hypertension: 58.3%, type 2 diabetes: 20.8%, hypercholesterolemia: 33.3%, current or past smoking: 59.7%, were evaluated after a median follow-up of 7.4 [5.8; 8.3] years. Over the period of follow-up, the median increase in PWV was 1.34 [0.10; 2.37] m/s. In multivariate analysis, the increase in PWV was associated with older age (10 extra years was associated with a 5.24 [1.35; 9.12] % increase in PWV) and hypertension (a significant increase in PWV of 8.24 [1.02; 15.57] %). No impact of CPAP adherence on PWV evolution was found. Conclusion PWV progression in CPAP-treated OSA patients is mainly related to pre-existing cardio-metabolic comorbidities and not influenced by CPAP adherence. In this high cardiovascular risk population, it is crucial to associated weight management and exercise with CPAP treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3047262621,"Ras family proteins play an essential role in several cellular functions, including growth, differentiation, and survival. The mechanism of action of Ras mutants in Costello syndrome and cancers has been identified, but the contribution of Ras mutants to Noonan syndrome, a genetic disorder that prevents normal development in various parts of the body, is unknown. Son of Sevenless (SOS) is a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor. In response to Ras-activating cell signaling, SOS autoinhibition is released and is followed by accelerative allosteric feedback autoactivation. Here, using mutagenesis-based kinetic and pulldown analyses, we show that Noonan syndrome Ras mutants I24N, T50I, V152G, and D153V deregulate the autoactivation of SOS to populate their active form. This previously unknown process has been linked so far only to the development of Noonan syndrome. In contrast, other Noonan syndrome Ras mutants—V14I, T58I, and G60E—populate their active form by deregulation of the previously documented Ras GTPase activities. We propose a novel mechanism responsible for the deregulation of SOS autoactivation, where I24N, T50I, V152G, and D153V Ras mutants evade SOS autoinhibition. Consequently, they are capable of forming a complex with the SOS allosteric site, thus aberrantly promoting SOS autoactivation, resulting in the population of active Ras mutants in cells. The results of this study elucidate the molecular mechanism of the Ras mutant–mediated development of Noonan syndrome."

This paper reports the reasons why horses failed to enter race training and documents their exit destinations. Biographical records of Australian Thoroughbred horses born in 2014 were investigated to determine the number of horses that had not officially entered race training by the start of the 4-year old racing season (1 August 2018). Of the 13,677 foals born in 2014, 66% had commenced training and 51% had raced before the beginning of their 4-year-old season in Australia. A sampling frame based on the post code of the premises where foals were born and records from Racing Australia were used to select a geographically representative sample of the 2014 Australian Thoroughbred foal crop (n = 4,124). From the population eligible for sampling 1,275 horses that had not entered training were enrolled in the survey and their breeders were sent an online questionnaire with follow-up phone calls for those who had not responded. Of the 633 responses (50% of 1275) the most frequent outcomes for horses were: death (38%, n = 239), participation in the racing industry in their 4-year old racing season (24%, n = 154) and retirement (16%, n = 100) either as Australian Stud Book (ASB) bloodstock (n = 17), or as horses rehomed outside the Thoroughbred industry (n = 83). Illness or injury was the most frequent reason for horses not entering race training that were ASB bloodstock, rehomed or deceased. There was a loss of traceability at the point of sale with most horses sold at 1 year of age. This study provides important information on the reasons, alternative outcomes and gaps in traceability for horses not entering training prior to the 4-year-old racing season."

The Gq/11 subfamily consists of Gq, G11, G14, and G16 proteins, of which all but G16 are inhibited by the structurally related natural products YM-254890 and FR900359.

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of membrane-bound receptors in the human genome, with ∼800 genes (around half of which are olfactory) (1Alexander S.P. Davenport A.P.

Upon receptor activation, a conformational change causes the Gα subunit to exchange the prebound GDP with GTP, which causes the heterotrimeric Gαβγ complex to dissociate (11Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E.

Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunit, and GTP hydrolysis restores the Gαβγ complex (11Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E.

Because virtually all known GPCRs couple to and elicit effects via one or more of the four families of G proteins, the elucidation of which G protein(s) a GPCR couples to provides essential knowledge in understanding the physiological function of the receptor. Modulators of G protein activity, therefore, constitute very important and powerful tools for studies of the numerous cellular and physiological responses that depend on G protein activity. As an example, identification of the G protein(s) involved in the observed response for a phenotypic GPCR assay, such as Corning Epic dynamic mass redistribution, can be deconvoluted with selective G protein inhibitors (15Schröder R.

A selective inhibitor has been shown to inhibit tumors driven by oncogenic mutations in Gαq and Gα11; thus, G protein inhibitors might also have therapeutic potential (17Annala S. Feng X. Shridhar N.

Therefore, there is great interest in the development of selective modulators and inhibitors of all four families of G proteins. The well-known pharmacological tool compounds capable of modulating G protein function are the two bacterial toxins, cholera toxin and pertussis toxin, that were discovered in the early 1980s and found to activate Gs and inhibit Gi/o, respectively (19Cassel D. Pfeuffer T. Mechanism of cholera toxin action: covalent modification of the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein of the adenylate cyclase system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Unfortunately, the complexity and size of the bacterial toxins make them poor starting points for derivation of modulators for other G protein families through rational design by conventional medicinal chemistry approaches.

Second, superposition of the inactive and active Gq structures based on the structurally conserved parts of the GTPase domain gave a very good fit, showing that this domain is a rigid entity and can be used as a reference domain when comparing Gα conformations (Fig. 1A). Based on this, we observe a rather large difference between backbone atoms in the helices of the helical domain. Thus, relative to the GTP-bound monomeric structure, the GDP– and YM-254890–bound heterotrimeric complex apparently entails a closure of the two Gαq domains moving 2.8 Å closer together as measured across the YM-254890–binding site.

In this study, we investigated the soundscape at green turtle neritic foraging habitats in Fiji, South Pacific, with the aims of characterizing the contribution of each component and of comparing the levels of acoustic pressure among sites with different abundances of sea turtles. Four sites were selected at two islands, and one hydrophone was deployed at each site. Generalized additive models highlighted that sound pressure levels (SPLs) at low frequencies (125–250 Hz) were especially affected by wind conditions, while at higher frequencies (>250 Hz) SPLs were mostly influenced by fish and crustacean acoustic activity. Higher abundances of green turtles were found at sites with the highest levels of SPLs and the highest number of acoustic emissions by fishes and crustaceans but were not related to maximum seagrass and macroalgae coverage, or the highest number of fish. The selected coastal habitats have negligible anthropogenic noise, thus this study informs physiological and behavioral studies of the acoustic signatures that sea turtles might target and provides a baseline against which potential impact of soundscape changes on sea turtle spatial abundance and distribution can be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W3047482109,"Introduction Numerous prior studies, even from countries with free access to care, have associated long travel time to care with poor survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Methods This is a data-linkage study of all 3718 patients with colorectal cancer, diagnosed between 2007 and 2013 in Northern Sweden, one of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe. Travel time to nearest hospital was calculated based on GPS coordinates and multivariable Cox regression was used to analyse possible associations between travel time and cause-specific survival. Results No association between travel time and survival was observed, either in univariable analysis (colon HR 1.00 [95% CI 0.998–1.003]; rectal HR 0.998; [95% CI 0.995–1.002]) or in multivariable Cox regression analysis (colon HR 0.999 [95% CI 0.997–1.002]; rectal HR 0.997 [95% CI 0.992–1.002]). Conclusions In contrast to most other studies, no association between travel time and colorectal cancer survival was found; despite that longer travel time was associated with known risk factors for poorer outcome. In the Swedish health care setting, travel time does not appear to represent a barrier to care or to negatively influence outcomes."

However, the clinical characteristics of second primary non-small cell lung cancer after cervical cancer (CC-NSCLC) compared with first primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC1) is unknown.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry between 1998 and 2010 was used to conduct a large population-based cohort analysis. The demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as prognostic data, were systematically analyzed. The overall survival (OS) in the two cohorts was further compared. The risk factors of second primary lung cancer in patients with cervical cancer were also analyzed.A total of 557 patients (3.52%) developed second primary lung cancer after cervical cancer, and 451 were eligible for inclusion in the final analyses. Compared with NSCLC1, patients with CC-NSCLC had a higher rate of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (36.59% vs 19.07%, P < 0.01). The median OS was longer for CC-NSCLC than for NSCLC1 before propensity score matching (PSM) (16 months vs. 13 months) but with no significant difference after PSM (16 months vs. 17 months). The high-risk factors for the development of cervical cancer to CC-NSCLC include age 50-79 years, black race [odds ratio (OR) 1.417; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.095-1.834; P < 0.05], and history of radiotherapy (OR 1.392; 95% CI 1.053-1.841; P < 0.05).Age 50-79 years, black race, and history of radiotherapy were independent risk factors for second primary lung cancer in patients with cervical cancer.

https://openalex.org/W3047043634,"Antibiotics discovery was a significant breakthrough in the field of therapeutic medicines, but the over (mis)use of such antibiotics (in parallel) caused the increasing number of resistant bacterial species at an ever-higher rate. This study was thus devised to assess the multi-drug resistant bacteria present in sanitation-related facilities in human workplaces. In this regard, samples were collected from different gender, location, and source-based facilities, and subsequent antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed on isolated bacterial strains. Four classes of the most commonly used antibiotics i.e., β-lactam, Aminoglycosides, Macrolides, and Sulphonamides, were evaluated against the isolated bacteria. The antibiotic resistance profile of different (70) bacterial strains showed that the antibiotic resistance-based clusters also followed the grouping based on their isolation sources, mainly the gender. Twenty-three bacterial strains were further selected for their 16s rRNA gene based molecular identification and for phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the taxonomic evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Moreover, the bacterial resistance to Sulphonamides and beta lactam was observed to be the most and to Aminoglycosides and macrolides as the least. Plasmid curing was also performed for multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial strains, which significantly abolished the resistance potential of bacterial strains for different antibiotics. These curing results suggested that the antibiotic resistance determinants in these purified bacterial strains are present on respective plasmids. Altogether, the data suggested that the human workplaces are the hotspot for the prevalence of MDR bacteria and thus may serve as the source of horizontal gene transfer and further transmission to other environments."
https://openalex.org/W3047251556,"Leukocyte viability (determined by e.g. propidium iodide [PI] staining) is automatically measured by hematology analyzers to check for delayed bench time. Incidental findings in fresh blood samples revealed the existence of leukocytes with decreased viability in critically ill surgical patients. Not much is known about these cells and their functional and/or clinical implications. Therefore, we investigated the incidence of decreased leukocyte viability, the implications for leukocyte functioning and its relation with clinical outcomes. An automated alarm was set in a routine hematology analyzer (Cell-Dyn Sapphire) for the presence of non-viable leukocytes characterized by increased fluorescence in the PI-channel (FL3:630±30nm). Patients with non-viable leukocytes were prospectively included and blood samples were drawn to investigate leukocyte viability in detail and to investigate leukocyte functioning (phagocytosis and responsiveness to a bacterial stimulus). Then, a retrospective analysis was conducted to investigate the incidence of fragile neutrophils in the circulation and clinical outcomes of surgical patients with fragile neutrophils hospitalized between 2013-2017. A high FL3 signal was either caused by 1) neutrophil autofluorescence which was considered false positive, or by 2) actual non-viable PI-positive neutrophils in the blood sample. These two causes could be distinguished using automatically generated data from the hematology analyzer. The non-viable (PI-positive) neutrophils proved to be viable (PI-negative) in non-lysed blood samples, and were therefore referred to as 'fragile neutrophils'. Overall leukocyte functioning was not impaired in patients with fragile neutrophils. Of the 11 872 retrospectively included surgical patients, 75 (0.63%) were identified to have fragile neutrophils during hospitalization. Of all patients with fragile neutrophils, 75.7% developed an infection, 70.3% were admitted to the ICU and 31.3% died during hospitalization. In conclusion, fragile neutrophils occur in the circulation of critically ill surgical patients. These cells can be automatically detected during routine blood analyses and are an indicator of critical illness."
https://openalex.org/W3047264649,"Background Diagnosis of TB in pediatric population poses several challenges. A novel initiative was implemented in several major cities of India aimed at providing upfront access to free-of-cost Xpert MTB/RIF to presumptive pediatric TB cases. This paper aims to describe the experience of implementing this large initiative and assess feasibility of the intervention in high TB burden settings. Methods Data were drawn from the pediatric TB project implemented in 10 major cities of India between April 2014 and March 2018. In each city, providers, both public and private, were engaged and linked with a high throughput Xpert MTB/RIF lab (established in that city) through rapid specimen transportation and electronic reporting system. Rates and proportions were estimated to describe the characteristics of this cohort. Results Of the total 94,415 presumptive pediatric TB cases tested in the project, 6,270 were diagnosed positive for MTB (6.6%) on Xpert MTB/RIF (vs 2% on smear microscopy). Among MTB positives, 545 cases were rifampicin resistant (8.7%). The median duration between collection of specimens and reporting of results was 0 days (same day) and >89% cases were initiated on treatment. Approximately 50% of the specimens tested were non-sputum. The number of providers/facilities engaged under the project increased >10-fold (from 124 in Q2'14 to 1416 in Q1'18). Conclusion This project, which was one of the largest initiatives globally among pediatric population, demonstrated the feasibility of sustaining rapid and upfront access to free-of-cost Xpert MTB/RIF testing. The project underscores the efficiency of this rapid diagnostic assay in tackling several challenges in pediatric TB diagnosis, identifies opportunities for further interventions as well as brings to light scope for effective engagement with healthcare providers. The findings have facilitated a policy decision by National TB Programme mandating the use of Xpert MTB/RIF as a primary diagnostic tool for TB diagnosis in children, which is being scaled-up."
https://openalex.org/W3047018831,"Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a standard treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma; however, it does not always result in tumor control. Nevertheless, treatment outcome can be improved with monodisperse emulsions of anticancer agents. In this study, the distribution of a monodisperse miriplatin-Lipiodol emulsion in the tumor and its safety were evaluated in ten Japanese white rabbits. VX2 tumor was implanted into the left liver lobe. The animals were divided into control and experimental groups (of five animals each) and respectively administered a conventional miriplatin suspension or the emulsion via the left hepatic artery. Computed tomography (CT) was performed before, immediately after, and two days following TACE. All rabbits were sacrificed two days after the procedure. Each tumor was removed and cut in half for assessment of iodine concentration in one half by mass spectroscopy and evaluation of Lipiodol accumulation and adverse events in the other half. Mean Hounsfield unit (HU) values were measured using plain CT images taken before and after TACE. Iodine concentration was higher in the experimental group [1100 (750–1500) ppm, median (range)] than in the control group [840 (660–1800) ppm], although statistically not significant. Additionally, the HU value for the experimental group was higher than that for the control group immediately after [199.6 (134.0–301.7) vs. 165.3 (131.4–280.5)] and two days after [114.2 (56.1–229.8) vs. 58.3 (42.9–132.5)] TACE, although statistically not significant. Cholecystitis was observed in one rabbit in the control group. Ischemic bile duct injury was not observed in any group. The results show that Lipiodol accumulation and retention in VX2 tumor can possibly be improved with a monodisperse emulsion; however, it should be verified with a larger study. Moreover, no significant adverse events are associated with the use of the emulsion."
https://openalex.org/W3047076068,"Viral diversity is an important feature of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and an important predictor of disease progression and treatment response. HIV/HCV co-infection is associated with enhanced HCV replication, increased fibrosis, and the development of liver disease. HIV also increases quasispecies diversity of HCV structural genes, although limited data are available regarding the impact of HIV on non-structural genes of HCV, particularly in the absence of direct-acting therapies. The genetic diversity and presence of drug resistance mutations within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) gene were examined in 3 groups of women with HCV genotype 1a infection, including those with HCV mono-infection, antiretroviral (ART)-naïve women with HIV/HCV co-infection and CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm3, and ART-naïve women with HIV/HCV co-infection and CD4 cell count ≥350 cells/mm3. None had ever been treated for HCV infection. There was evidence of significant diversity across the entire NS5B gene in all women. There were several nucleotides and amino acids with distinct distributions across the three study groups, although no obvious clustering of NS5B sequences was observed based on HIV co-infection or CD4 cell count. Polymorphisms at amino acid positions associated with resistance to dasabuvir and sofosbuvir were limited, although the Q309R variant associated with ribavirin resistance was present in 12 individuals with HCV mono-infection, 8 HIV/HCV co-infected individuals with CD4 <350 cells/mm3, and 12 HIV/HCV co-infected individuals with CD4 ≥350 cells/mm3. Previously reported fitness altering mutations were rare. CD8+ T cell responses against the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B57-restricted epitopes NS5B2629-2637 and NS5B2936-2944 are critical for HCV control and were completely conserved in 44 (51.8%) and 70 (82.4%) study participants. These data demonstrate extensive variation across the NS5B gene. Genotypic variation may have a profound impact on HCV replication and pathogenesis and deserves careful evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3047435017,"This study examined the effect of a competitive season on salivary responses [cortisol (sC), testosterone (sT), Testosterone/Cortisol ratio (sT/C), Immunoglobulin A (sIgA), sIgA secretion rate (srIgA), alpha-amylase (sAA)] and upper respiratory symptoms (URS) occurrence in three teams of male soccer players (Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 yrs.). Training and competition volumes, salivary biomarkers and URS were determined monthly. No differences were found for monthly training volume between teams. Incidence of URS was higher for the U15 (44.9% of the total cases). Higher sT and srIgA were observed for the U19, lower sC were found for the U17 and sAA showed higher values for the U15 throughout the season. In the U15, significant difference (p = .023) was found for sIgA concentration with higher concentration values in January compared to December (-42.7%; p = .008) and the sT showed seasonal variation (p < .001) with the highest value in January significantly different from October (-40.2%; p = .035), November (-38.5%; p = 0.022) and December (-51.6%; p = .008). The U19 presented an increase in sC in March compared to February (-66.1%, p = .018), sT/C were higher in February compared to March (-58.1%; p = .022) and sAA increased in March compared to September (-20.5%; p = .037). Negative correlations, controlled for age group, were found between URS occurrence and srIgA (r = -0.170, p = .001), sAA (r = -0.179, p = .001) and sT (r = -0.107, p = .047). Monitoring salivary biomarkers provides information on mucosal immunity with impact in URS occurrence. Coaches could manipulate training loads to attenuate the physical stressors imposed on athletes, especially at demanding and stressful periods."
https://openalex.org/W3047532768,"Self-contained imaging systems are versatile instruments that are becoming a staple in cell culture laboratories. Many of these machines possess motorized stages and on-stage incubators that permit programmable imaging of live cells that make them a sensible tool for high-throughput applications. The EVOS imaging system is such a device and is capable of scanning multi-well dishes and stitching together multiple adjacent fields to produce coherent individual images of each well. Automated batch analysis and quantification of these tiled images does however require off-loading files to other software platforms. Our initial attempts to quantify tiled images captured on an EVOS device was plagued by some expected—and other unforeseeable—issues that arose at nearly every stage of analysis. These included: high background, illumination and stitching artifacts, low contrast, noise, focus inconsistencies, and image distortion—all of which negatively impacted processing efficiency. We have since overcome these obstacles and have created a rigorous cell counting pipeline for analyzing images captured by the EVOS scan function. We present development and optimization of this automated pipeline and submit it as an effective and facile tool for accurately counting cells from tiled images."
https://openalex.org/W3037499274,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has recently been implicated in thirst in rodent models. The mechanisms for this are currently uncertain, and it is unclear whether hydration status can alter FGF21 concentrations, potentially providing an additional mechanism by which hypohydration induces thirst. The aim of this study is therefore to understand whether hydration status can alter circulating FGF21 in humans.Using a heat tent and fluid restriction, we induced hypohydration (1.9% body mass loss) in 16 healthy participants (n = 8 men), and compared their glycaemic regulation to a rehydration protocol (heat tent and fluid replacement) in a randomised crossover design.After the hypohydration procedure, urine specific gravity, urine and serum osmolality, and plasma copeptin (as a marker for arginine vasopressin) increased as expected, with no change after the rehydration protocol. In the fasted state, the median paired difference in plasma FGF21 concentrations from the rehydrated to hypohydrated trial arm was -37 (interquartile range -125, 10) pg∙mL-1(P = 0.278), with average concentrations being 458 ± 462 pg∙mL-1 after hypohydration and 467 ± 438 pg∙mL-1 after rehydration; mean difference -9 ± 173 pg∙mL-1.To our knowledge, these are the first causal data in humans investigating hydration and FGF21, demonstrating that an acute bout of hypohydration does not impact fasted plasma FGF21 concentrations. These data may suggest that whilst previous research has found FGF21 administration can induce thirst and drinking behaviours, a physiological state implicated in increased thirst (hypohydration) does not appear to impact plasma FGF21 concentrations in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3047007876,"Mycobacterial culture remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, an appropriate digestion and decontamination method (DDM) is essential for the effective recovery of tubercle bacilli in culture. Therefore, the current study was designed to compare the performance of papain-cetylpyridinium chloride [papain-CPC] and pepsin-cetylpyridinium chloride [pepsin-CPC] DDMs against N-acetyl L-Cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH) DDM for recovery of mycobacteria from clinically suspected pulmonary tuberculosis cases. To evaluate papain-CPC, pepsin-CPC and NALC-NaOH DDMs, sputum samples (N = 1381) were cultured on Löwenstein-Jensen medium and the results were compared. The papain-CPC DDM showed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100%, 93.27%, 71.7%, and 100%, respectively as compared to NALC-NaOH DDM. Similarly, pepsin-CPC DDM demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 98.94%, 94.7%, 76.11%, and 99.81%, respectively. In summary, both papain-CPC and pepsin-CPC DDMs are highly sensitive and specific techniques for recovery of mycobacteria as compared to NALC-NaOH DDM. However, when the overall performances of all DDMs compared, papain-CPC DDM isolated increased number of mycobacterial isolates with comparatively higher numbers of colonies on LJ media than both pepsin-CPC and NALC-NaOH DDMs, indicating its potential to replace the NALC-NaOH DDM for recovery of mycobacteria from sputum samples."
https://openalex.org/W3047306496,"While complex sample pooling strategies have been developed for large-scale experiments with robotic liquid handling, many medium-scale experiments like mycotoxin screening by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) are still conducted manually in 48- and 96-well plates. At this scale, the opportunity to save on reagent costs is offset by the increased costs of labor, materials, and risk-of-error caused by increasingly complex pooling strategies. This paper compares one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and Shifted Transversal Design (STD) pooling to study whether pooling affects assay accuracy and experimental cost and to provide guidance for when a human experimentalist might benefit from pooling. We approximated mycotoxin contamination in single corn kernels by fitting statistical distributions to experimental data (432 kernels for aflatoxin and 528 kernels for fumonisin) and used experimentally-validated Monte-Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations) to evaluate assay sensitivity, specificity, reagent cost, and pipetting cost. Based on the validated simulation results, assay sensitivity remains 100% for all four pooling strategies while specificity decreases as prevalence level rises. Reagent cost could be reduced by 70% and 80% in 48- and 96-well plates, with 1D and STD pooling being most reagent-saving respectively. Such a reagent-saving effect is only valid when prevalence level is < 21% for 48-well plates and < 13%-21% for 96-well plates. Pipetting cost will rise by 1.3–3.3 fold for 48-well plates and 1.2–4.3 fold for 96-well plates, with 1D pooling by row requiring the least pipetting. Thus, it is advisable to employ pooling when the expected prevalence level is below 21% and when the likely savings of up to 80% on reagent cost outweighs the increased materials and labor costs of up to 4 fold increases in pipetting."
https://openalex.org/W3047529469,"Background Chagas disease, caused by the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is one of the most important parasitological infections in the Americas. It is estimated to infect approximately 6 million people from mostly low income countries in Latin America, although recent infections have been reported in southern US states. Several studies have described an extensive genetic diversity among T. cruzi isolates throughout its geographic distribution in the American continent. This diversity has been correlated with the pathology developed during an infection. However, due to a lack of a single reliable test, current diagnosis practices of the disease are not straightforward since several different tests are applied. The use of current genomic sequence data allows for the selection of molecular markers (MM) that have the ability to identify the Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) of T. cruzi in a given infection, without the need of any sequencing reaction. Methodology/principal findings Applying three criteria on the genomic sequencing data of four different phylogenetic lineages of T. cruzi, we designed several molecular tests that can be used for the molecular typing of the parasite. The criteria used were: (1) single-copy orthologs of T. cruzi, (2) T. cruzi unique loci, and (3) T. cruzi polymorphic loci. All criteria combined allowed for the selection of 15 MM, 12 of which were confirmed to be functional and replicable in the laboratory with sylvatic samples. Furthermore, one MM produced distinct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon sizes among distinct T. cruzi DTUs, allowing the use of a AFLP-PCR test to distinguish DTUs I, II/IV, V and VI. Whereas two MM can differentiate DTUs I, II, IV and V/VI out of the six current DTUs with a PCR-RFLP test. Conclusions/significance The designed molecular tests provide a practical and inexpensive molecular typing test for the majority of DTUs of T. cruzi, excluding the need to perform any sequencing reaction. This provides the scientific community with an additional specific, quick and inexpensive test that can enhance the understanding of the correlation between the DTU of T. cruzi and the pathology developed during the infection."

Mixed results were reported on the occurrence of donor specific antibodies under mTOR-Is. Here, we present long-term results of the SMART-Trial. Methods and materials N = 71 from 6 centers (n = 38 SRL and n = 33 CsA) of the original SMART-Trial (ITT n = 140) were enrolled in this observational, non-interventional extension study to collect retrospectively and prospectively follow-up data for the interval since baseline. Primary objective was the development of dnDSA. Blood samples were collected on average 8.7 years after transplantation. Results Development of dnDSA was not different (SRL 5/38, 13.2% vs. CsA 9/33, 27.3%; P = 0.097). GFR remained improved under SRL with 64.37 ml/min/1.73m2 vs. 53.19 ml/min/1.73m2 (p = 0.044). Patient survival did not differ between groups at 10 years. There was a trend towards a reduced graft failure rate (11.6% SRL vs. 23.9% CsA, p = 0.064) and less tumors under SRL (2.6% SRL vs. 15.2% CsA, p = 0.09). Conclusions An early conversion to SRL did not result in an increased incidence of dnDSA nor increased long-term risk for the recipient. Transplant function remains improved with benefits for the graft survival."

The following variables were analyzed: Demographic parameters (age, sex), indications for surgery, operative procedures, preoperative and postoperative platelet count (postplenectomy RT), the use of anticoagulant therapy, and postoperative complications. The patients were divided into two groups according to indications for splenectomy: The non-neoplastic hematology group and the non-hematology group (splenectomy for trauma or other spleen non-hematological pathology).Fifty-two pediatric (37 male and 15 female) patients who underwent splenectomy at our institution were reviewed. Thirty-four patients (65%) were in the non-hematological group (splenic rupture, cysts, and abscess) and 18 patients (35%) in the non-neoplastic hematological group (hereditary spherocytosis and immune thrombocytopenia). The two groups did not differ significantly in regards to the patients' age, sex, and preoperative platelet count (P>0.05 for all variables). Forty-nine patients (94.2%) developed postplenectomy RT. The percentages of mild, moderate and extreme thrombocytosis were 48.9%, 30.7%, and 20.4%, respectively. The comparisons of RT patients between the non-neoplastic hematology and the non-hematology group revealed no significant differences in regards to the patients' age, sex, preoperative and postoperative platelet counts, preoperative and postoperative leukocyte counts, and the average length of hospital stay (P>0.05 for all variables). None of the patients from the cohort was affected by any thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications.We confirm that RT is a very common event following splenectomy, but in this study it was not associated with clinically evident thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications in children undergoing splenectomy for trauma, structural lesions or non-neoplastic hematological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3047514110,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) accelerates coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis, the causes of most heart attacks. The biomolecules involved in these inter-related disease processes are not well understood. This study analyzes biomolecules in the sera of patients with CAD, with and without type (T) 2DM, who are about to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The goal is to develop methodology to help identify and monitor CAD patients with and without T2DM, in order to better understand these phenotypes and to glean relationships through analysis of serum biomolecules. Aorta, fat, muscle, and vein tissues from CAD T2DM patients display diabetic-related histologic changes (e.g., lipid accumulation, fibrosis, loss of cellularity) when compared to non-diabetic CAD patients. The patient discriminatory methodology utilized is serum biomolecule mass profiling. This mass spectrometry (MS) approach is able to distinguish the sera of a group of CAD patients from controls (p value 10-15), with the CAD group containing both T2DM and non-diabetic patients. This result indicates the T2DM phenotype does not interfere appreciably with the CAD determination versus control individuals. Sera from a group of T2DM CAD patients however are distinguishable from non-T2DM CAD patients (p value 10-8), indicating it may be possible to examine the T2DM phenotype within the CAD disease state with this MS methodology. The same serum samples used in the CAD T2DM versus non-T2DM binary group comparison were subjected to MS/MS peptide structure analysis to help identify potential biochemical and phenotypic changes associated with CAD and T2DM. Such peptide/protein identifications could lead to improved understanding of underlying mechanisms, additional biomarkers for discriminating and monitoring these disease conditions, and potential therapeutic targets. Bioinformatics/systems biology analysis of the peptide/protein changes associated with CAD and T2DM suggested cell pathways/systems affected include atherosclerosis, DM, fibrosis, lipogenesis, loss of cellularity (apoptosis), and inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W3047306410,"The current study examined the effect of a group's potential for improvement and decline in morality and competence on applicants' willingness to join the group. We conducted four experiments with 399 Chinese participants who rated their willingness to join groups with potential for improvement, potential for decline, or stability in terms of morality or competence. The results showed that, compared with groups with stable competence, participants preferred groups with potential for competence improvement and were more averse to groups with potential for competence decline. However, the biases regarding the potential for moral improvement and decline were asymmetric. Specifically, compared with groups with stable morality, participants had no preference for groups with potential for moral improvement, but were more averse to groups with potential for moral decline. Possible explanations for the asymmetric biases regarding the potential for moral improvement and decline and future research directions are discussed."

A researcher observed the consultations, which were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded and an analysis of setting, type of communication implemented and participation of doctors and patients in terms of word-count and type of questions/answers was carried out. Overall word-count was significantly higher for physicians than for patients (t(44) = 9,506; p<0.001). Doctors were prone to ask closed questions (t(44) = -11,90; p<0.001) while patients preferred open answers (t(44) = 5.58; p<0.001), enriched with subjective issues related to their illness experience. Partial correlation highlights a significant positive relation between doctors' closed question and patients' open answers (r = .838; p<0.001).Findings emphasize patients' need for adequate time and space to share their subjective illness experience with the physician, within an approach informed by the insights and recommendations of Narrative Medicine. These findings are instrumental to improving the specific clinical setting for individuals with genetic cardiomyopathies."

A novel dynamic algorithm based on the CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) methodology with adjustment for casemix and random frailty for an operating unit was developed and implemented to monitor the revision rates over time. The Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method was used to adjust for multiple testing of numerous hip replacement implant brands and cup/ head combinations at each time point.Three poorly performing cup brands and two cup/ head brand combinations have been detected. Wright Medical UK Ltd Conserve Plus Resurfacing Cup (cup o), DePuy ASR Resurfacing Cup (cup e), and Endo Plus (UK) Limited EP-Fit Plus Polyethylene cup (cup g) showed stable multiple alarms over the period of a year or longer. An addition of a random frailty term did not change the list of underperforming components. The model with added random effect was more conservative, showing less and more delayed alarms.Our new algorithm is an efficient method for early detection of poorly performing components in hip replacement surgery. It can also be used for similar tasks of dynamic quality monitoring in healthcare."
